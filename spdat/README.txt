Three spdat files were sourced from Project 1999:

spdat.velious.eff
spdat.01.03.2001.eff
spdat.14.03.2000.eff

The rest were sourced from a wayback_machine_downloader dump of the various EQPatch.zip files on www.everquest.com.tw, you can find them in those zips. 

I have renamed them to their patch dates for convenience.
