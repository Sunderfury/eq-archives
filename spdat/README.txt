Two spdats were sourced from the Phase4 and Vanilla CD .iso's on Archive.org, I gave them their file modified dates as names:

- spdat-phase4-beta-cd.26.01.1999.eff
- spdat.original-retail-cd.16.02.1999.eff

One spdat from May 1999 was found on the Newsgroups, given in text format with spell names only:

- spdat.20.05.1999.eff.txt

One spdat was sourced from Project 1999 and it corresponds to the spdat.eff on the Kunark CD:

- spdat.14.03.2000.eff

The rest were sourced from a wayback_machine_downloader dump of the various EQPatch.zip files on www.everquest.com.tw, you can find them the contents of those patch zips under the /eq-patches folder, with web archive links to the original sources in its README. I have named them to their patch dates for convenience.

If you need a program to read these, EQCaster should work. I have added two EXEs here, a latest version and an older version. The web archive link is the following if you want it:
