             <P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Hail and well met,
             brave adventurer, for you have entered the king of the dungeons : <i>Sebilis</i>,
             lair of the mighty <i>Trakanon</i>, destroyer and curse of the
             fallen Iksar civilization.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Oh boy, here we are.
             Sebilis is the place where most of us have made our way thru to 60.
             You can say that <i>Sebilis</i> is to Kunark what <i>Sol B</i> was
             to the Old World (first EQ, with no expansions) : the toughest
             zone, with a wide lvl range and with uber bosses waiting for you at
             the very bottom of the zone.</font></P> 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Sebilis is just too
             large and too complicate to describe in this necro guide. I would
             probably need a whole new guide apart to fully describe Sebilis's
             areas, camps, mobs and loot. So basically what I will do is to name
             the most common camps, loot and a spot where you can partner up and
             duo in case you don't find group.</font></P> 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">First of all, I need
             to say that Sebilis is kind of exquisite place (well, considering
             this is just a game, don't get me wrong) in the way that you will
             only find here very high lvl players (post 55 most of em) in full
             plannar and dragon armour. Besides, high end level comunity is not
             as large as pre 50 is, so everybody knows each other, either from guild events or from having grouped in the past. With this, I
             want to point out that you should try to work on your
             reputation with your fellow high level players of your server.
             Otherwise you will have a hard time to get invited in groups or
             raids. Be friendly, corteous, and most important of all, learn how
             to play your class in groups (take a look to the <b><a href="Necro%20in%20group.htm">how
             to play a necro in group</a></b> section).</font></P> 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Well, first of all
             you need to complete a quest in order to obtain the key to Sebilis.
             You will have to track (a tracker will be a must) and kill the <i>froglok
             hunter</i> and the <i>froglok forager</i> in <i>Trakanon's Teeth</i>
             zone, which is the zone right next to <i>Sebilis.</i> Then, once
             you loot the pendant from each of those froggies, turn them in to
             the named undead in the cave placed in the SW corner of the zone.</font></P> 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Sebilis, like <b>chardok</b>,
             has got the zoning in point far away from the zone out, meaning you
             won't be able to just walk back out like you did in, say, Karnor in
             case things would turn nasty. But dont worry, Sebilis entrance is
             pretty safe. Now sit down and start shout for a group&nbsp; </font><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="3">:
             )&nbsp; </font></b><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">I do
             not recommend you to set your hunting headquarters in Sebilis
             before you hit 55. Why? well, necromancers are not very group
             orientated class (please don't flame me. I know we can be very
             useful in groups, but we ain't any group's wet dream) so if you are
             low level -meaning lower than 55- either you have previously built
             a long list of ingame friends/guildmates, or expect long downtimes
             looking for group. Later on, or at least in my personal experience,
             once people get to know you and apreciate you as valuable group
             coleague, you will get into a group pretty soon.</font></P> 
             <P><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">I will now comment
             some of the most camped rooms in Sebilis, with its named and the
             loot :</font></P>

                  as <b>Ex</b>. This is the hall that leads to the zoning out
                  port. Three Golems and few frogs spawn here. Very safe camp
                  (exit within few feets) and nice exp. No named spawn here
                  though. </font></p>

                  as <b>N-G</b>.
                  Very very easy room, no need of enchanter nor cleric (high
                  level shaman/druid just as good here). Not the best place
                  expwise in the other hand. Nameds are <i>Guardian Golem</i>
                  (drops a 10 charges invisibility mask and the <i>Lamentation</i>)
                  and <i>Necrosis Scarab</i> (drops cane of tranquil and
                  Crystalline short sword).</font></p>

                  as <b>D1 </b>and<b> D2</b>. Disco 1 is, as long as the puller
                  is experienced and you time the spawning time in room, quite
                  easy to handle with a good group. Disco 2 is a bit tougher,
                  requiring an enchanter. Exp is great here, non stop pulling.
                  Named is <i>Frenzied Pox Beetle</i> (drops beetle
                  stinger,&nbsp;Deepwater bracer, inbued fighter staff and runed

                  even need of and enchanter or cleric if there is none
                  available. One of the best exp rooms in the dungeon in my
                  opinion. Named is <i>Gangrenous Scarab </i>(drops Elder Spirit
                  Heml, Staff of waterwalker and Gangrenous Beetle Mask).</font></p>

                  Deep inside the dungeon, will almost be impossible to hit the
                  exit running if you ought to. One of the nastiest rooms, where
                  everything might look peaceful but if you don't control the
                  spawning time you might end up with five frogs on your butt
                  (several spawning point in this room). Best room expwise in my
                  opinion. Named here is the <i>froglok chef </i>(drops Fayguard
                  Bladecatcher, Sebilite scale cape, Sebilite scale vambracers
                  and Mrylokar's bracer), <i>Froglok Repairer</i> (drops singing

                  Also very deep inside, with plenty of undeads around. You need
                  a rogue to open the crypt room door. Lots of named spawns here
                  with one of the greatest loot of the game (<i>hierophant's
                  cloak</i>,<i> Jaudiced bone bracer</i>,<i> silken snare whip</i>,
                  etc.). High level mobs but most of them are single pulls, so
                  not very tough. Exp is ok only if you pull the emperor's room
                  whereabouts too.</font></p>

                  very tricky, with trains forming up all of a suden out of
                  nowhere. Named are <i>Froglok Armourer</i> (drops singing

                  like giant purple mushrooms and are level 55ish. Of course,
                  you better go there only with a good post 55 group or you're
                  toast. Named is the <i>King</i> (drops Fungus tunic, Fungus
                  great staff and robe of the living fungus). In my opinion, exp
                  ain't very good here because the bloody mushrooms got around
                  15000 HP and some complete heal themselves !!</font></p>

             time here. Great dungeon, but very packed sometimes, which makes it

             <p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">As I
             said, there is a spot where you can duo with someone (high level
             shamans are the best necro parters in my opinion : slow, pet,
             regrowth, buffs, etc. Also another necro, a druid, mage or even an
             enchanter will make of the two of you a dangerous gang). I marked
             that spot on the <b><u><a href="SebilisMap.htm" target="_blank">map</a></u>
             </b>as <b>Duo</b>. Basically, pull the mob with <i>Dooming
             Darkness</i> and <i>Paralizing Earth</i> it once it's on the safety
             spot. Now the two of you load some DoTs (<i>Pyrocuror, splurt and
             cessation of corr</i> prefered, <i>Envenomed bolt</i> might brake
             the root). If the frog is of the <i>Zol</i>, <i>Dar</i> or <i>Jin</i>
             type (easy froggies), then send both pets in right after the first
             root has landed (forget about 53 or 56 pets, they die too fast. Go
             for 49 or 59 pet). If the mob is a <i>bok</i> type, wait till the
             DoTs have eaten half of his life. Don't try on anything higher (<i>krups</i>,
             <i>beetles</i>,<i> illies</i>, <i>golems</i>, etc. They got just
             too many HPs and they summon).&nbsp;</font></p>
