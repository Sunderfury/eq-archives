			 <P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial"><B><U>Gargoyle&acute;s
				Isle</U></B></FONT></P>
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Gargoyles&acute;s isle is in the OoT
				(Ocean of Tears) zone. This zone is actually a deepsea zone made out of several
				tiny islands spread all over the zone.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Grab a friend, a mage or druid
				prefferable and take him with you, because the gargoyles you are just about to
				hunt go from lvl 17 to 20, so you won&acute;t be able to solo them. But believe
				me, if you convince that friend to come along, non of you will regret it.
				Besides, there&acute;s no need of any larger group. Just 2 of you should be
				enough.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">To get here, get on the boat at the
				East Freeport docks. Once you have zone into the OoT, jump at the first stop
				(sister isle&acute;s dock&acute;s been marked out with a red cross on the <B><A
				HREF="gargoyles_isle_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>) but don&acute;t get
				off on the dock &acute;cause you might be KoS to the NPC sister standing on
				that very Dock. Wait till the boat has departed from that dock and jump off
				about 100 feet away. Then swim to the beach and stay there. Now have a look to
				the OoT map and spot out the gargoyles&acute;s isle (purple squared
				area).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Cast Gather Shadows on you (there are
				loads of sharks in the water) and swim to any of the two blue crosses on the
				<B><A HREF="gargoyles_isle_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>. That will be
				your binding point. Don&acute;t adventure any farther inside that isle because
				there are some very aggro cyclops who would tear your ass apart without a
				second thought.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Now, with Gather Shadows again on you
				swim up to the gargoyles&acute;s isle (purple squared area on the <B><A
				HREF="gargoyles_isle_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>) and look for kinda
				cape sticking out into the sea. I think it should be where the yellow cross
				lies on the <B><A HREF="gargoyles_isle_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>,
				but I&acute;m not sure. Just circle arround the island by the seaside and
				you&acute;ll see it. There&acute;s a single tree on the cape. That would be
				your pulling spot since it&acute;s the isle&acute;s most far away point from
				its center, where 4 bored spectre stand still composed<B> : ) </B>But
				don&acute;t worry, as soon as you don&acute;t get anycloser than about 50 feet
				from there, they&acute;ll let you in peace.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok now, there&acute;s a place holder:
				the greater skelletons, easy lvl 12 skelletons. A place holder means that if
				you don&acute;t kill them, the gargoyles won&acute;t spawn &acute;cause there
				is a certain number of spawns allowed at the same time, so the more skellies,
				the less gargs. So from time to time you&acute;ll have to do the skellies
				cleaning up.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">As soon as you see a garg, pull it to
				the cape with darkness. You and your mate should be strong enough to kill it,
				but just in case cast Fear so the pet won&acute;t die. Of course, before
				casting it away, check arround that no other garg is anyclose. Don&acute;t cast
				all your DoTs in a quick row or the garg will aggro on you, and they hit very
				hard, so count few seconds between DoTs. As I said, they hit up to 42, so try
				to share the damage between you, your pet, your mate, and your mate&acute;s pet
				if he&acute;s got any.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The gargs drop <I>A gargoyle&acute;s
				eye </I>which can be sold for 8 pp each at Oasis gypsy camp. On top of that,
				they mostly drop them by couples among some research words !! Of course, the
				eyes are not dropped every single kill, but maybe once every five kills. If you
				and your friend stick to this place for few levels, I promisse you that
				you&acute;ll leave OoT with hundreds of pp in eyes, ready to be sold in Oasis,
				and that is good money, ain&acute;t it?</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Another good point of this isle is
				that you&acute;ll NEVER find it camped up. I don&acute;t know why, but it looks
				like this spot has remained kinda secret for most of the players. So take your
				chance !!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Before I told you about your binding
				point at the isle next by gargoyles&acute;s isle. Why to have it there? Because
				this is a very tiny isle, and if you are in problems Feign Death (check <B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm">spell list</A></B> for more info) is not the solution.
				As soon as you stand up, the garg will fly back towards you. Alternatively,
				when the garg is hitting you ass hard, you&acute;ll cast Shadow Step (almost
				instant spell casting) and right afterwards cast Gate. Then, once you get to
				the other isle, you may cast Feign Death in order to wipe you from the
				gargoyle&acute;s aggro list. And now, med up, cast gather shadow, swim back
				safely to the cape, cast a new pet and let&acute;s start again. Easy,
				isn&acute;t it?</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Gargoyles&acute;s isle is a good
				hunting place from lvl 16 to 20. The only problem is that you cannot solo here
				(not at least untill lvl 18) without taking a big risk because gargs have got a
				high MR (magic resistance). So you&acute;ll have to find someone who is up to
				spend few days in a deserted volocanic island with no other company but yours
				<B>: ) </B>But if you get that person, this will be a fine hunting
				place.</FONT></P> 
			 <BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Tip 1:</B> There&acute;s no
				  vendor at all in OoT, so before coming here, store loads of bone chips, food
				  and water supplies in your inventory, or you&acute;ll have to wait ages for the
				  boat to come over.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Tip 2: </B>Whenever you want to
				  come back to Freeport, you would have to get back to sister&acute;s isle, wait
				  for the boat, and then to sail to Faydwer first and then all the way arround
				  towards Freeport. This whole trip could easily take more than half an hour !!
				  But hey, I&acute;m here to assist you : Pinch a small boat ( there&acute;s one
				  at sister&acute;s isle on the right hand of the docks) and go to this very
				  location : neg 4637, neg 6510 and wait there for the boat to come towards you.
				  Then, you just have to release the boat&acute;s captain helm and walk forth to
				  the boat. You will pop up inside the boat and few seconds later you&acute;ll
				  zone into Freeport. Do not leave the captain&acute;s before the boat comes to
				  you, because the small boat takes about 5 mins to respawn at sister&acute;s
				  isle and you along with it !!. So, whenever you see the boat aproaching, right
				  click once (this way you won&acute;t be in charge of the boat anylonger and
				  will be free of movement) and when the boat swallows you, walk straight towards
				  it.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> </TD>
