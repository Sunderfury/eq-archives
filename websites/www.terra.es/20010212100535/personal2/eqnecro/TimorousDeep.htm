             <u><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Timorous Deep</font></b></u>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the SW corner of Timorous Deep
             (exact loc is -9200, +3200), there is a tiny isle full up with
             nasty raptors. Have a look to the <b><a href="TimorousDeepmap.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>
             to find your way there (please note that the Isle has been zoomed
             in. Real proportions are indeed smaller).</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These raptors are low-mid 40s, and
             110 hp hitters, but surprisingly they aint have more than 3000 hp.
             Besides, loot is absolutely zero, nothing, nada, niente&nbsp; <b>:
             )&nbsp;</b></font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The main problem here is the <b>huge
             </b>aggro radius. I have never seen such a wide aggro radius like
             these guys have. This, added to the small size of the isle, makes
             imposible the <b><a href="strategies.htm">fear-kitting</a></b>.So,
             what you do is to pull them with <i>Ignite Blood</i> (check <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells
             list</a></b> if needed) to the hidden cove marked with a white
             cross on the <b><a href="TimorousDeepmap.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>.
             This cove is aside and far away enough from the raptors roaming
             path, so if you single pull here, no other will jump along. But
             thats exactly the tough thing : to single pull raptors. If you see
             that two of them are close to each other and that you <b>will</b>
             pull them both, do this : Pull away casting <i>Ignite blood</i> on
             one of them. Now run with <i>DMF</i> and <i>J/boots </i>(a must in
             here. I warn you, <b>dont</b> try to solo here without a shiny pair
             of <i>J/boots</i>) the hell deep inside the ocean till you are out
             of the casting range. Turn around, quickly dive into the water, and
             cast <i>Root </i>on the one who isnt Dotted. Now, run back to the
             cove with the other one on your back. By the time Root brakes free,
             you will be far away from his aggro range.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And what do we do once we have
             single pulled a raptor to the cove? well, we <b><a href="strategies.htm">Root
             - DoT</a></b> it to death. Since we dont have to much space to walk
             backwards leaving a safety gap between us and the raptor, I advice
             to recast <i>Root</i> every 20 secs. Its very mana cheap to cast,
             so dont worry if you cast it 5 or 6 times per battle. This is the
             plan : single pull to cove with ignite blood, root, splurt, bond of
             death, root, 20 secs, stand up and root, 20 secs, stand up and
             root, 20 secs, stand up and root, 20 secs and loot the corpse (ops,
             I forgot there is no loot at all hehe ). Since they have less than
             3000 hps, those three DOTs should be enough to take them down, and
             with <i>lich</i> up you wont burn too much mana per fight.&nbsp;</font></p>
