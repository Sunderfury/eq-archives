			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Well, in my humble opinion, this is
				the funniest part of the game. Being able to size up your skills and powers
				with your same is an amazing experience, and you won&acute;t find that exciment
				( and nervousness) anywhere else in Norrath but when dueling. Also,
				you&acute;ll make mistakes that you wouldn&acute;t otherwise make in a mob
				fighting, and in a PvP, those mistakes mean most likely death.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">First of all, these PvP guide has been
				dessign on blue servers dueling enviorment rather than in actual PvP servers.
				In those ones, rules are compleatly different and some other tactics could
				apply.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The most important thing in duels is
				to keep in mind who are you about to fight against. <B><I> Every class needs a
				different combat strategy</I></B>, and you gotta adapt yourself (due to your
				wide spells range) to the enemy&acute;s class fighting way. Each class has got
				some weakpoints, and you must be smart enough to exploit them to the
				end.</FONT></P> 
			 <P>I<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">n the <B><A HREF="equipment.htm"
				TARGET="principal">equipment section</A></B> I stated that your main equipment
				issue would be to reach 200 Intelligence. Well, that&acute;s not 100% accurate
				when talking about dueling a spells caster class. Then, <B><I> magic resistance
				bonus items should be what you&acute;re looking for</I></B>. Heat and cold
				items too. Poison and Disease are important while dueling a Shaman or another
				necro.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Of course, no need to say that you
				should <B><I> cast everysingle buff and shielding spell you&acute;ve
				got</I></B> in your spell book on you. Also arm and buff your pet up, and med
				up both mana and HP till full.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In spite of the fact that your pet is
				one of your main weapons in any monster-hunting, they won&acute;t be so crucial
				when dueling. Remember that your adversary is no brainless mob, and therefore
				he won&acute;t waste his time and HP dealing with your pet but you !!&nbsp; So
				<B><I> don&acute;t rely too much on your pet</I></B> and just consider him as
				one of your DoTs. And don&acute;t worry if the guy fights him and kills him.
				Believe me, that would be the best that could happen : a moron wasting his HP
				or mana against your pet. So, don&acute;t heal the pet and don&acute;t
				recast&nbsp; if he dies either unless you are full mana and you
             are hidden somwhere -pet summoning casting lasts over 10 seconds-.</FONT></P> 
			 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Tip :</B> As a necro, <B><I> you
				  need plenty of space to perform your powers</I></B>, no matter if hunting or
				  dueling, so only accept duels in open-field non-KoS zones. You&acute;ve been
				  warned. Main reason for this is because Shadow Step&nbsp; is one of our mayor PvP
                spells -specially against melee classes-, and it&acute;s only useful outdoors.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Tip 2 :</B> Before starting a
				  duel, <B><I>when you cast your buffs, don&acute;t cast the best ones at the
				  beginning</I></B>. Cast two or three shit ones (like grim aura, deadeye, etc.)
				  and then cast your valuable buffs (shieldskins, mayorshielding, spirit
				  armour,etc.). Once done this, cancel the shit ones (click on their symbols).
				  Hence you&acute;ll have few empty slots up at the top of your screen. What for?
				  Because in those empty slots where be placed your adversary&acute;s nasty
				  permanent spells (DoTs, root, blind, snare, etc) and since Cancel Magic spell
				  dispells one by one the spells from the top to the bottom, you won&acute;t need
				  to cancel all your lovely buffs in order to get rid of his DoTs. This is very
				  important, it can safe your life when dueling against casters !!</FONT></P> 
                <P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tip 3 : </b>Against classes
                that have cancel magic spell, and specially at high levels when
                you can not start the duel with ST (above lvl 40-45 ST starts
                getting resisted very oftenly), I would recommend you to buff up
                your oponent before landing your lure DoTs with 2 fast buffs -<i>Impart
                Strengh</i> and <i>Spirit Armour</i> are perfect-. Why? Because
                if your oponent is smart, he will clean up the first two buff
                slots, being able to dispell your DoTs afterwards. If,
                alternatively, you refill those two slots with some silly buffs,
                the DoTs will placed at the bottom of his buff window, so he
                won't be able to dispell them unless he fully dispells himself.
                This is usefull only if you expect a long duel, like for example
                against druids and shamans.</font></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Tip 4 :</B> Beware of tricky
				  players when dueling within zones with ponds, lakes, rivers or seaside. Why?
				  Because there is a bug (or I believe it to be a bug) about not being able to
				  cast on players underwater if you are outside, and viceversa. And this applies
				  even if only your feet are in the water. With this, they would step outside the
				  water, cast the hell on you and step back in afterwards when it&acute;s your
				  turn to cast away. No damage will be taken. If you notice any adversary playing
				  this game, shout it out loud and make him feel ashame of
				  himself.</FONT></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 5 : </b>Mostly,
                you ll see that I advice to open up the fights with Screaming
                Terror -check <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells list</a></b>-
                hoping to <i>mezmerize </i>your oponent for a short lenght of
                time and therefore gaining few seconds to load DoTs on him.
                Well, this is only possible under two circunstances :</font></P>
                <ul>
                  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Your oponent is blue conning
                    or even white conning, never higher.</font></li>
                  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Your oponent s magic
                    resistance aint very high.</font></li>
                  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Neither of you are over level
                    40. Over lvl 40 the chances of <i>Screaming Terror, RooT,
                    Fear, Stun</i> etc are senssibly reduced.</font></li>
                </ul>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 6 : </b>Against pet
                classes, you <b>never</b> fight the pet. Never load DoTs and
                waste mana on them. Just <i>root</i> them aside or <i>fear</i>
                them away, but do not try to kill them. If the master dies, so
                the pet does, so keep focus'd on the master.</font></p>

			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">These are mellee classes, specially
				the warrior. But, at any rate, they all need to be within mellee distance to
				beat your butt. They actually lack of any other fighting strategy apart from
				the slash, hack, kick, bite and spit. And that&acute;s your main advantage :
				They need to be close to you. Thanks God we&acute;ve got a lovely lv 8 spell
				called Shadow Step (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm"
				TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info) which is a random
				teleportion within a 300 feet radius circle. Its main adventage is that is 1
				second-long casting spell, so it&acute;s virtually instantaneous. Besides,
				it&acute;s almost mana free to cast. This spell will be the key to succees
				against mellee classes. Watch out cause this spell can easily drive you out of
				the casting distance, so you might have to walk back into it : )</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Don&acute;t accept the duel being any
				close to the adversary. Get plenty of space between you two. If the guy
				doesn&acute;t give you that space, cast Shadow step immediately after accepting
				the duel. With this, you&acute;ll get that gap needed and also the guy will be
				confused for few secs trying to spot you out. Now cast quickly the lvl 24 spell
				Screaming terror (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm" TARGET="principal">spells
				list</A></B> for more info). Its a fast 2.5 secs casting spell, so you&acute;ll
				be able to cast it before the guy reaches up to you. It&acute;s a brief, short
				version of the enchanter&acute;s spell mesmerize. It makes the target to stand
				still for 10-15 secs without any control of himself (he won&acute;t cast, move
				or attack). In those 10-15 seconds, your job is to cast every single DoT
				you&acute;ve got on him (starting from the low resistance rate ones).
				Afterwards, send pet on him and run away. Once he brakes free the Screaming
				terror&acute;s effects, he&acute;ll be headed towards you like a maniac ( if he
				sticks to your pet trying to get rid of him quickly, he ain&acute;t got a clue
				what a duel is about). Just run in circles untill the DoTs wear off. Some other
				necros would try to Fear the guy away, but in my own experience Fear gets
				resisted much more often when dueling than in normal combats. Not sure why.
				Once the DoTs effect has worn off, wait for him to get close to you and cast
				once more Shadow Step. Again, he&acute;ll be desorientated and you will have
				gained a safetly gap between the two of you. And now start all over again:
				Screaming terror followed by DoTs, and run away&nbsp; : ) </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Doing all this written above, I have
				won duels without being hit even once.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><A
				NAME="There4s another variety of this very same strategy">There&acute;s another
				variety of this very same strategy</A>. Whenever you know in advance
				you&acute;re gonna duel some lad, just bind yourself at any hidden spot not
				very far away from where the duel will take place (within the zone, of course).
				Best idea could be to get bound inside any small hut, or behind a large rock,
				or on the other side of that hill, or whatever spot you could think of. After
				having cast all your DoTs and sent pet on him, Screaming terror should be about
				to wear off, but you&acute;ll still have time enough to cast the 4 secs long
				casting lvl 4 Gate spell (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm"
				TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info). Hehehe I love this :
				Your adversary will be desperatly looking for you while you&acute;re sitting
				down listening to the chart hits on the radio and medding mana up. On top of
				that, DoTs are doing their job. If for some reason you got beaten up, and
				therefore your shieldskin series spell (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm"
				TARGET="principal">spell list</A></B> for farther info about this series) is
				off now, recast it. Once DoTs wear off, show up, spot the guy, re-DoT, re-Gate,
				re-listen to the chart hits. Believe me, this could really piss the guy off,
				but hey! this is a duel to death ain&acute;t it? Fuck the honour. You are a
				smart ass and therefore you win!! If, by fluke, the guy finds your lair, Shadow
				Step and run the hell far away (with the lad chasing you several yards behind).
				Say you get to the other corner of the zone. Just shadow step again and gate
				back. Hehehe. Too lovely to be real, isn&acute;t it? There&acute;s one main
				drawback : the dude will probably /petition you for being too annoying&nbsp;
             </FONT><b><font face="Arial" size="3">:&nbsp; )</font></b></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If during the duel, he gets on you
				slashing you ass hard, Shadow Step is your best defence, or even have
				harmshield ready to cast if you don&acute;t know what to do. This&acute;ll give
				you 10 secs to cool down and think clearer. Just remember, keep him full DoTed
				and away from you, and you&acute;ll win. Don&acute;t cast DD spells or lifetaps
				(this only if really needed) since tank classes have loads of HP and
				you&acute;ll need your whole mana bar in order to cast DoTs (more mana
				efficient than DDs). Do not forget to have always the dark pact series up,
				because tanks have got loads of HP and you&acute;ll burn most of your mana on
				them.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><b>And what about the rogue?</b> He&acute;ll
				always try to wear his camouflage on (invis effect) and snake up on your back
				to stick his tiny dick into your butt ( high damage backstab attack). So, first
				of all, have <i> Dead eye</i> or <i>DMF</i> spell cast on (sees thru invis. Check <B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm" TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info),
				and don&acute;t worry too much about them circling and spinning around you
				looking for your back, you can still cast while turning yourself in circles, or
				just Shadow Step away and Screaming Terror afterwards.&nbsp;It&acute;s very
				important not to let them hit you, &acute;cause they grease their weapons with
				poison, and it will deal good damage to you. Also, don&acute;t root them and
				step back thinking your safe. They are skillful with bows and throwing knives
				too. So, Shadow Step away and cast ST from the distance.</FONT></P>

				blind, healing, root, Fear undead, shielding buffs, cancel magic etc. Besides

				Lay on Hands, which is a once-per-hour-only massive healing. I&acute;m telling
				you, not a nice lad to mess with.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The DoT-Gate technique won&acute;t
				work out since they&acute;ll dispell your DoTs with cancel magic. Also you
				can&acute;t DD them off &acute;cause with so many HPs and healings and
				shieldings and stuff you won&acute;t have mana enough. Also, forget about your
				pet since they&acute;ll defiantely fear it away or blind it (pet walks around
				like a head-chopped chicken unable to make his blows good). On top of that,
				they can stun you, then root, then walk into mellee distance and slash you to a
				shapeless bloody pulp on the floor. Finally, many tanks tend to have a

				(healing, cancel magic). So I&acute;m affraid we&acute;ll have to be quite
				agressive this time. Let&acute;s just hope he hasn&acute;t got a high Magic
				Resistance bonus gear.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Start off, as usual, the battle with
				lvl 24 Screaming Terror spell (check <B><A HREF="spellslist.htm"
				TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info). Cast your 2 most poweful
				DoTs, forget about minor ones. Now, in order to have him away of Cancelling our
				DoTs, cast fear and lets hope it holds on him. Ok now, if it does stick to him,
				you&acute;ve got about 10 secs to deal large amount of damage :&nbsp; cast
				Shock of Poison (lvl 24 spell, check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm"
				TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info) the hell away few times.
				Then, stand still ready to recast Screaming Terror again when Fear wears off.
				It&acute;s a fast 2.5 secs long casting spell, so you should be quicker than
				any of his spells. And again DD him few times, recast Fear, and again burn all
				your mana on him. I know this is not the way a necro should play since our DD
				are not very mana efficient, but there&acute;s no other way to fight this guy.
				He has got just too many HP (considering several healings and Lay on Hands).
				Actually, if you let him use his healing skills, it&acute;s like if you had to
				take down 3 times his whole HP bar, and you just haven&acute;t got that much of
				mana.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In the other hand, let&acute;s say he
				got free of our Screaming Terror and Fear spells and he&acute;s on us. He
				doesn&acute;t have offesive spells, so as any tank class, he needs to mellee in
				order to win. So, once more, if he has rooted or blind us, Shadow Step will be
				our best deffence (shadow step macro4d of course).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Let&acute;s say you have done a good
				job and you eventually inflict lots of damage to him, but, in the last moment
				he resorts to Lay on Hands and gets his HPs bar back to full. Of course, after
				such a combat you&acute;ll be low on mana. Well, don&acute;t worry, use the
				previous explained tacnic to Gate to a hidden spot (see <I><B><A
				HREF="#1. Dueling a warrior-rogue">how to duel a warrior-rogue
				section</A></B></I> above). Then med up HP and mana, and of course let him do
				the same. Then, let&acute;s start the combat again, only difference is that now
				he won&acute;t be able to use LoH because it can be used only once every 70
				minutes.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The main issue while fighting paladins

				cross between a necro and a warrior. They usually have our same spells, just 2
				circles later (at lvl 29 they get most of our lvl 20 spells including pet).
				This makes them, in my opinion, absolutly useless casters. Only thing that can
				irritate you is the Fear spell, but do not worry much about their pet (yours
				will destroy his very quickly) or attacking spells (they will fight you with
				Heat blood when you&acute;ve got boil blood, or even venom of the snake.
				Anyway, have Cancel Magic ready against his minor DoTs) or even their Shadow
				Step ( we are no mellee class, so no need for us to get toe to toe with them).
				So, this leads us to a mellee class with Fear.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

				lvl 24 spell Screaming Terror (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm"
				TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info) at the beginning, use
				your 2 best DoTs and send pet in. Now take some distance and check his strategy
				when ST brakes free : If he decides to Darkness-Fear the pet at first to get
				rid of it, just recast quickly Screaming Terror. You&acute;ll have your DoTs
				and pet dealing good damage on him. This way, you&acute;ll make him forget
				about your pet the next round and have him headed towards you (that&acute;s
				what you want). Since Screaming Terror burns little mana (only 60), and is
				quick to cast (2.6 secs), just keep it on him due to avoid his Fear since it
				could really screw you up. If he Fears you, he&acute;ll get into mellee
				distance and hack and slash you very hard. Also he&acute;ll use his best
				attack, the once-per-hour-only <I>Harm Touch, </I>which is as devastating as a
				mage&acute;s nuke for that lvl. I cant stress enough how deadly
             this caress can be, having your HP bar to plummet down at least 1
             or 2 bubs !!&nbsp; My advice is to have the skinshield always up, since
             it will absorb most of the damage. Do not hesitate to recast it if
             it wears off.</FONT></P>

				and run in the oposite direction !!. Have your pet in the target screen (hit F1

				in the other hand, you see that you are running out of mana, as soon as you are
				full HP, Shadow Step and Gate away. Both of you would have wasted plenty of

				care too much about your pet, so they&acute;ll waste their precious first
				seconds casting root on pet and walking few steps back away from him. That
				gives you 4 secs of advantage, and that&acute;s all what you need : Screaming
				Terror, 2 DoTs (Poison, Disease and Heat blood spell line
             prefered. This will be enough to kill
				them), and a fast lifetap chain casting (lvl 20 siphon spell recomended for its
				faster casting time which will brake their nukes casting). An experienced
				wizzie would cast stun first on us, and then deal with the pet later. But, if
				your pet has been fully buffed and armed up, he&acute;s got the chance to keep
				braking the 2-secs-long-casting root spell casting.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">But beware fellas necromancers,
				wizzies got our very same Shadow Step spell (just called someother way) and
				their nukes, as the ultimate magic users, have got a huge distance range. Some
				of them Shadow Step the hell off and tend to nuke you down from miles away. If
				you see that something like that is going on, just run to the farthest corner
				and wait for them to seek you, and belive me they will if you have DoTed them.
				In stead of using only 2 DoTs, use 3 since Heat Blood can be dispelled (Poison
				and Disease don&acute;t, unless he&acute;s a high level and got already Nullify
				Magic) and because wizzards have got very few HP, so they should be enough to
				kill them if they Shadow Step away.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">But belive me, you can take down a
				Wizzard if you quickly cast few DoTs and keep lifetapping on them. Also, if you
				can, cast a Screaming Terror on them in the middle of the battle and targeting
				on your pet, cast Cancel Magic in order to nullify wizzie&acute;s root spell.
				This will make them panic, &acute;cause pet can brake their concentration
				whilst spell casting.</FONT></P>

             you wont have any problem.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">In case you do not have that MR
             equipment set, try the following advices even tho enchanter will
             probably win :</font></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Before accepting a duel with an
				enchanter, you better know him as a honourable adversary. I mean, enchanters
				with charm spell can really do evil PvP duels. I&acute;ve seen enchanters
				charming the other guy as a pet, casting levitate on themselves, and walk you
				to the middle of any lake for a &acute;swim&acute;. Of course, they
				didn&acute;t cast levitate on you so you drown. Or even worse, to a lava pit,
				where you won&acute;t ever be able to recover your toasted corpse back !! Or
				what about having you to jump off a cliff? Also, they can charm your butt and
				have it to punch that bulky grimmy-looking red conning guard. All these ways of
				dueling are extremly evil since you&acute;ll definately lose exp, and since no
				server-wide message will be typed proclaming the enchanter of any duel. If you
				ever are target of any of these shits, petition it straight away. Do not let it
				go. If many people report this unfair duels, Verant will undoubtly nerfed down
				Charm spell in duels (they have already done so in PvP servers, pretty much
				like our Fear spell), and that&acute;s the way it should be. </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok now, let&acute;s consider the
				enchanter is a fair player. Still they are the toughest PvP class in game in my
				opinion. They&acute;ve got mesmerize, stun, manatap spells (same as our lifetap
				spells, but mana tapping), powerfull DD spells, Fear, blind, Nullify Magic,
				pet, Charm, buffs, Magic Resistance debuffer, etc.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">First of all, it&acute;s most
				important when dueling to enchanters to have a high Magic Resistance bonus gear
				because of their Magic Resistance debuffer Tashani spell, and hence you
				won&acute;t resist any of their spells.&nbsp;</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Second thing. Against enchanters is
				better not to have a pet. Why? Because they&acute;ll charm it against you
				!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">We have only 1 very way to win
				enchanters in duels : Fear spell. I know I have told you that is far too often
				resisted, but believe me, no other way around against this fellows. Now, the
				first seconds of the duel will determine the winner, no doubt about that.
				It&acute;s important to know the different ways enchanters open up the duel :
				a) with Tashani debuffer. b) casting the 2.5 secs long casting mesmerize spell
				on you. c) wait till you begin to cast and straight off casting back stunning
				spell (takes only 1 secs to be cast away and stuns you for fews
				secs).</FONT></P> 
			 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>a)</B> If they start with tashani
				  spell, and therefore drop your Magic Resistance to floor, they&acute;ll cast
				  right afterwards mesmerize. This is the best turn things could take, because
				  that second they waste casting Tashani, is your only chance to hold your Scream
				  Terror on them. ST lasts only about 10 secs, so cast the highest Fear spell you
				  have to prolong their lack of control on themselves. Now, cast your 2 highest
				  DoTs (the quickest to perform their total damage. Lvl 34 spell Venom of the
				  snake is perfect) and chain cast Shock of Poison till you kill him. Trick is to
				  finish them off as quickly as you can. Enchanters are THE masters of control,
				  so if you let them think, you&acute;re a dead necro.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>b)</B> If they open up with
				  mesmerize spell, then it&acute;s all about whose spell lands first, either his
				  mesmerize or your ST. Or who resists the best (that&acute;s why a high magic
				  resistance gear is so crucial against casters, specially against enchanters.
				  Also our charisma stat is important since ST does a check on charisma). Pray
				  you are quicker, or you&acute;ll be in deep shit. They&acute;ll probably suck
				  your mana while you&acute;re mesmerized, and they&acute;ll be ready to stun you
				  as soon as mesmerize wears off, hence gaining some more seconds and starting
				  all over again. When you&acute;re mesmerize, keep hitting the Shadow Step
				  button, and again pray for it to be a long distance one.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>c)</B> If they decide to hold on
				  for you to begin to cast away, and they inmediately cast the 1 sec long casting
				  stun spell, I&acute;d say you have already lost the battle mate. Once
				  you&acute;re mesmerized, they will suck all your mana and then you&acute;re out
				  of it !! Only solution I could think of is to cast Shadow Step the first (it
				  takes the same casting time as stunning spell, and since they waited for you to
				  cast first, you&acute;ll make it), and again, pray God for the Shadow Step to
				  drive you out of the casting distance range.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">I know it really sucks, but whereas
				soloers none can match a necro, when it comes to dueling I&acute;d state that
				enchanters are the one to beat.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">So, how to open up a battle against an
				experienced enchanter? If I was one of them, I&acute;d definately go for the
				last of the duels opening up strategies shown above. This leaves as with 1 very
				only solution : Shadow Step as our first spell, expecting it to take us the
				hell out of the casting distance. If it does, aproach to the battle area step
				by step, and between steps hit the screaming terror button. Once you have
				landed it on him, you&acute;ve got few seconds to cast Fear till it holds, and
				then just run closer, DoT him twice and nuke him down with shock of poison or
				your highest lifetap spell.</FONT></P>

				guys are tough. I consider myself a fairly good and experienced dueler, and I

			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Well, fighting against a Shaman is a
				weird experience. Why? Because they use our very same way of fighting : )&nbsp;
				Their DoTs are as nasty as ours, based on poison and disease. If your are below
				lvl 39 (where you get Nullify Magic), these DoTs are not magic based spells and
				therefore can&acute;t be dispelled off with Cancel Magic spell. Thanx God
				we&acute;ve got cure disease, but no cure for the poison on our spell
				book.&nbsp;</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Before I mentioned that they use
				similar duel fighting tactics than necros : They DoT you and run with SoW fast
				off your grip (we use shadow step followed by gate, but is the same point).
				Once the DoTs effects have worn off, they just step into the casting distance
				range to recast DoTs, and step outside again. So what to do? Screaming Terror
				will again be the key. Don&acute;t DoT him right after ST spell. In stead cast
				Fear untill it gets hold on him. Then you&acute;ll cast your DoTs and finish
				him off with few Shock of Poison casting.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Basically, a shaman is a similar class
				to druids. Only difference is that druids have a wider spell range, but
				shamans&acute;s DoTs are far more powerfull. But, at the end of the day, is the
				same story. Use your screaming terror spell, it rules.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">You&acute;ll see some shamans trying
				to melee you. These guys are not experienced duelers and don&acute;t know how
				to get the best out of their characters. Just Shadow Step and cast ST. Or even
				you might try to cast ST between blows too.</FONT></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><i>How to fight a high level
             shaman once Fear, Screaming Terror and Root wont work? </i></b>High
             level shamans are the toughest duelers for a necro. Do I make
             myself clear enough? They are the <b>best</b> against us!! They
             have problems against melee types though because they cant <i>Shadow
             Step</i>, and if the tank has got <i>J Boots</i>, <i>SoW</i>
             becomes almost useless.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Why is it that shamans are so tough
             at high levels : mostly because they all got a lovely bracer called
             Jaudiced bone bracer (AC14, effect: unlimited 260 cold based DD,
             dropped in Sebilis). So what do they do? They root your pet with
             Paralizing Earth (which is very dificult to dispell even with anul
             magic) and wait for you to DoT em. Then they would dispell and heal
             themselves (they got dispell magic, disease and poison !!!),
             renewing Paralizing Earth on your pet every while. Eventually the
             both of you run OOM (you landing DoTs / lifetapping on him and he
             dispelling and healing himself). Once this has happend, they root
             your pet one last time and nuke you down to death with the mana
             free bracer s nuke.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Basically, in my opinion, the only
             way to beat a high lvl shaman is to have <b>awesome</b> saves vs
             poison, disease and cold. And I really mean awesome. I have at the

             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With this saves I do resist their

             I am about to purchase 3 more items that will boost my SV cold up
             to 180. I will update the result in this page, but if even then I
             still dont resist the nuke, I d say that there is no way in hell a
             high level necro can beat a high level shammy with JBB in a duel.
             Sorry, but thats the cold truth (hehe speaking about cold).&nbsp;</font></p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But lets say you do have enough Sv
             cold, poison and disease gear to resist his spells. Do not bother
             no cast any of your DoTs on him, he will dispell em all. Your main
             weapon will be your pet, so save up&nbsp; your mana for <i>Anul
             magic</i> on your pet once the shamy has landed <i>paralizing earth</i>
             on him (it ll take you few tries to dispell that damn root) or even
             to recast pet if he dies.&nbsp;</font></p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The shamy will try to cast his
             highest malosi (debuffer) spell on you. At high levels thats -60 to
             all saves !! Of course, you ll have your first few slots on the

             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I dont know, but even if you get to

			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Fool players would state that a cleric
				would never be a good PvP class. Smart ones would give it a second thought
				before accepting the duel against a cleric, specially us necros due to the
				cleric&acute;s spells vs undead (either fear or DD vs undead) that can push our
				pet out of the game inmideately.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The reason many people say clerics are
				weak duelers is because their offensive spells aren&acute;t that powefull. They
				don&acute;t have DoTs, and their DD spells suck as much as ours do : ) So
				where&acute;s the catch? They have stun spell and blind spell (both very quick
				casting spells, 1.5 secs). On top of that they&acute;ve got root, loads of
				deffensive buffs (like for example our Harmshield, check <B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm" TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info)
				and specially healing spells that heal their HP bar up for large amounts of
				HPs. I remember first time I dueled a cleric : I would keep renewing on him my
				very painful heavy mana DoTs, and he would keep dispelling and healing himself
				up. Eventually I run out of mana and he took me down in melee
				combat!!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">They will probably open up the battle
				with the fast casting stun spell, then either root or fear the pet off, then
				walk into melee distance (where they would beat us everyday), then back off for
				a sec and re-stun, followed by a quick healing, and back again into melee after
				renewing root on pet. Also, they would try to blind us just in case we have
				been foolish enough not to have set up your spells macroed in hot buttons. And
				from time to time, cast a reasonably harmful DD spell.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Since Screaming Terror takes slightly
				longer to cast than stun, again I&acute;d advice you to Shadow Step first
				willing to both confuse the cleric and wasting some of his time trying to spot
				you out. Of course, if after casting SS you&acute;re still inside the casting
				distance range, hit hard the Screaming Terror spell button, followed by Fear
				till it holds on him. Then DoT him and chain cast Shock of Poison, or even
				better lifetap series (the highest one you&acute;ve got) because they are
				unresistable. Clerics&acute;s ain&acute;t got a pool of HP, so few high level
				lifetaps and 2 DoTs should be enough. Don&acute;t let them brake free of your
				grip or they&acute;ll stun you straight away, cancel your DoTs (cancel magic
				for heat blood series and darkness series, cure disease and cure poison for
				disease and poison based DoTs), heal himself and root your pet.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Not as hard as enchanters are, but
				still a Cleric can be a tough fellow. All these control-power classes (necros
				among them) are a pain in the ass, so the quicker to beat the crap outta them,
				the better. Pretty same as I stated above in the enchanters section, the trick
				is to not let them perform their quick stun spell, or they&acute;ll have the
				control and timing of the battle, and you don&acute;t want that.</FONT></P>

			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Bard&acute;s main stock-in-market
				ain&acute;t spells but songs, which have 4 adventages over spells casting
				classes: Don&acute;t burn mana, can be performed while running, can play few
				songs at the same time, and as long as the bard plays them their effects will
				be up, no need of any re-casting.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Do you want some examples about what
				kind of songs the can sing? DD song, DoT song, mana drain song, stunning song,
				mermerize song, charm song, snare song, self-speeding up song, HP regeneration
				song, buffs song, MR (Magic Resistance) song that will increase their MR up to
				absurd limits, Fear song, etc.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">And besides the can perform few songs
				at the same time. Most of them will tend to use a DD song, a charm song
				(sending your pet against you), a mesmerize song and a mana drain song, running
				around you while constant amount of damage is inflicted (both from DD song and
				from your own charmed pet) and your mana bar plummets down. Besides you
				won&acute;t be able to do anything due to the mesmerize song. They can also try
				to melee you, adding some more wounds to your already beaten up ass.</FONT></P>
			 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Or. alternatively, they might set
				themselves on deffensive position, using a combination of MR buffs (at high
				levels this will boost their MR up to almost 100!! ), while draining your mana
				and charming your pet. With such a high MR, not even 1 of your Spells will
				stick on them.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">They only way you can beat a Bard in a
				PvP enviorment is to establish the following rule : Bard cannot start the duel
				with his songs already being sung. If the bard is already playing his
				instruments when you accept the duel, I&acute;d say that you&acute;ve lost it.
				Besides, it&acute;s a fair rule since we can&acute;t cast our DoTs on him
				before the duel has started. This will give you very short secs to do your job
				: Screaming Terror, send pet, 2 DoTs and chain casting
				lifetaps.&nbsp;</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Don&acute;t give him a break or
				he&acute;ll use his damn fast selo&acute;s accelerando (faster than SoW) to
				escape away, coming back later with all his song 100 % operative. Besides, 2
				DoTs won&acute;t be enough to kill a bard, so a bit of nuke work will be
				required.</FONT></P>

                <blockquote>
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Tip:</B> a Bard&acute;s songs

				and straight away lifetap him back.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Not really much else to say. You know
				how a necro works, just figure out the way to anull him. But you&acute;ll see
				by yourself how everything will be about to non-stop lifetapping each other. In
				this chaos, if you have ST and DoTed him before, you shouldn&acute;t
             lose this
				duel mate.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If, in the other hand, he has cast
				nasty DoTs on you and there&acute;s no way you can keep on with the battle,
				Shadow Step away, Cancel Magic the magic based DoTs ( Heat blood and darkness
				series) or Nullify them all (if you&acute;re above lvl 39). Then Lifetap some
				low level zone inhabitants to regen some HP back and med with
             Lich (or whatever version you got) till he finds you out.</FONT></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial"><i><b>How to fight a high level
             necro once Fear, Screaming Terror and Root wont work? </b> </i>Have
             his pet targeted before accepting duel. Once it has started quickly
             fear his pet away and call your pet to back off, sending it right
             away aginst the necro. Most likely, he will do the same, opening up
             the duel either with <i>fear</i> or <i>paralizing earth </i>on your
             pet. If this happens that both pets are anulled or fighting each
             other, land a lure DoT on him (splurt or bond of death) and chain
             lifetap him with your highest lifetap. You will see how everything
             becomes a lifetapping battle between the two of you, and everything
             will depend on who runs out of mana first, or who has landed a DoT
             on who, on who has taken few pet's hits, etc. Anyway, the battle
             will last less than 30 sec.</font></P>
