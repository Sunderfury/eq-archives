      <u><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#0066FF">Lower Guk Death Side</font></b></u>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Oh boy, here we are. Before the Kunark
      expansion, Lower Guk was the most popular zone for high level players. And
      still lots of them consider this dungeon as the best in Norrath. And now
      you are scratching your chin wondering why, arent you?&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Well, it is pretty simple : good exp and
      AWESOME loot. In fact, some of the most outstanding items in game are
      dropped here. Want some few examples? there you go : Crown of the froglok
      kings ( 20 sv fire, 20 sv cold, 12 AC), Runed cowl (5 wis, 9 int, 2 ac),
      Shinning matalic robe ( 9 int, 8 sv cold, 8 sv fire, 10 ac), Flowing Black
      silk Sash ( effect : haste), White gold necklace ( 7 magic resistance, 7
      sv fire, 7 sv cold, 5 char), Executioner s axe ( attack 25, delay 25,
      effect: haste), etc. Have a look to the zone <a href="lower%20guk%20map.htm" target="_blank"><b>map</b></a>
      to know where do these items drop.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Lower Guk is divided in two subzones : the
      dead and the live side. Out of those two, I honestly believe that the dead
      one is the one for you. One reason is that the best items are dropped
      there, but most important is that, as a necro, it would not be any easy
      for you to get into a party in the life side. Alternatively, you are
      indeed of good use to any group when it cames up to kick some undead
      asses: you can nuke them, charm them, mesmerize them, root them, hail
      them, etc.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">To be group - dessireable is very important
      in Lower Guk because it is absolutely imposible to solo here. Lower Guk
      has been dessigned kinda maze-alike, with severals rooms where the big
      fellows ( who drop the most looked for items) spawn every half an hour
      aproximately. On top of that, there are plenty of minor froggies roaming
      up and down the corridors. This means that you cannot camp by yourself the
      room boss because he will tear you apart, and you cant solo in the
      corridors because you will end up being chased down by a nasty train. So I
      am very afraid this zone is only group based hunting&nbsp; <b>: (</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">The most important character in any party
      when hunting in Lower Guk is the enchanter. He will undoubtly safe far more
      lifes than the cleric himself due to his/her mass control skills. Well, I
      would say you are also an undead mass control master yourself !!&nbsp; And
      thats exactly what you gotta make your group to understand. There is no
      real bad need of an enchanter if a necro is around. You can charm one
      froggie, sick her to another of her colleagues, root or mesmerize a third
      one (with rest the dead spell. Check <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells
      list</a></b> if needed), etc, hence cooling a highly harzardous train down
      into a female primary schooll music band. I cannot stress it enough mate :
      either you play the enchanter rol or you ll stand small chances to get
      into any group. Come on, lets face it : if they want a pet/nuker, they
      would
      go for the mage everyday, and since Fear is not feasible inside a dungeon,
      theres no real reason any group would take a mage, wizzard, druid or
      enchanter down for you in stead&nbsp; <b>: (</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">So, we have got here a dungeon where you can
      get good exp and where you can acquire very good (and expensive) items,
      right?. Well, do you want to know my personal opinion? Lower Guk fucking
      sucks !!!&nbsp; First of all, there is no way you can solo here, and even
      if you are in a group you wont be able to perform your wonderful
      Darkness-Fear-Dot combo. Only thing you will be asked to do is either play
      as a mage (send pet in and nuke the hell away with your DD vs undead
      spells) or as an enchanter (as explained above), but never as what you
      actually are, a necro. Second, exp is not that awesome. I mean, its good
      but since you gotta share the exp with a full group, either you find a
      very professional non-stop-pulling party, or the exp bar will stay put
      for ages. And on top of that the good items take hours to drop and even if
      it eventually drops, you will have to win the lotto. I swear on God, there
      is nothing more frustrating than to camp a room for the whole
      fu***ng evening and when the big boss finally drops whatever item he
      drops, to lose the lotto !!&nbsp; ACK !! you wanna kill somebody !!&nbsp;
      I camped once myself the magi room (who drops the shinning metallic robe)
      for more than 20 hours on a weekend and didnt ever got the robe. Only
      two robes were dropped while my group was camping the room and I lost both
      lottos. Believe me, after that weekend I was sooo upset that I didnt
      play EQ for the next week at all !!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Well, give it a try anyway for few days. If
      you get lucky you ll leave Lower Guk with dozens of thousands plats in
      items (selling/trading time in Commonlands). But, if you are looking for exp, you
      better look somewhere else where you may solo. Just my warning : If you are planning to go to Lower Guk to get some lovely items and therefore
      update your inventory, supply yourself with plenty of food, water, bone
      chips and coffee because you are gonna spend here loooooong time. That I
      can promise you&nbsp; <b>: )</b></font>
