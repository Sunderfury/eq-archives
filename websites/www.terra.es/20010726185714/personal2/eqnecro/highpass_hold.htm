			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok, HH (Highpass Hold) is as good and
				famous zone for players between lvl 16 to 20 as Oasis is for levels 12 to 16.
				This zone is great not only because of the exp, but also because of the great
				loot. Here you&acute;ll make in the next levels hundreds of pp and therefore
				you&acute;ll be able to afford some items that you were only dreaming about
				before.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">There are only two drawbacks : You are
				highly KoS to the guards (so don&acute;t mess arround the inner part of the
				zone) and you will have to hunt here in group. Trains of orcs and gnolls are
				common here, and also the zone&acute;s heavily camped, so forget about hunting
				solo here. But don&acute;t worry, it&acute;s worthy. I would recommend you to
				go there with a full group of friends or guildmates, because both the orc area
				(red squared area on the <B><A HREF="highpass_hold_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>) and the gnoll area (blue squared area on the <B><A
				HREF="highpass_hold_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>) are most of the times
				fully camped and they won&acute;t accept new members. And don&acute;t worry
				about KS (kills stealing), this place is so messy and wild that you can&acute;t
				bother on such a nuisances.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Now, have your gruop headed to either
				the gnolls or orcs spawn, Gather Shadows spell always up if you need to cross
				thru the city itself. An now... start pulling away : ). There&acute;s no real
				tip I can give you here since you&acute;ll see by yourself that everything
				happens very fast in HH. Just try to keep the zonning location sense always up
				due to escape from those dangerous trains. And that&acute;s it !! During
             these
				4 levels you&acute;ll spend here try to loot as many ringmail armour pieces and
				bronze weapons in order to sell them for good cash at the vendors (I happen to
				recall the closest one is in West Commonlands, but I could be mistaken), and
				levels will fly upwards one after another, and so your bank account will
				!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">This zone is just amazing. Come with
				your group here, pull the gnolls/orcs fast and see how you hit lvl 20 within
				very few days.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Lovely zone indeed<B> :
