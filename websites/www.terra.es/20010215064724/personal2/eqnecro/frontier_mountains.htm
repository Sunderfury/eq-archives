			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">This is another zone of the newly
				discovered continent of Kunark, between Lake of ill Omen, the Overthere and the
				Dreadlands.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In spite of the fact that
				there&acute;s plenty of roaming creatures here you could solo, this is the
				first time I&acute;m gonna tell you to group. Why? Because in Frontier
				Mountains there is probably one of the best spawns in the game : The giants
				fortress. Theese lvl 28-30 giants spawn so fast that there&acute;s enough room
				for several groups camping the same place. Actually, I&acute;ve seen up to 7
				different groups camping the fortress and non of them argued about KS (kills
				stealing).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">There are 2 places where you can set
				up your group&acute;s base : At the front gate or inside by the eastern wall
				(see <B><A HREF="frontier_mountains_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> of
				Frontier Mountains). Obviouly, pulling inside the fortress itself is much
				faster, but you need a whole group there because some times two giants jump on
				you at the same time. Besides, you don&acute;t want to Fear the giant neither
				whilst inside the fortress!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If you plan to camp outside at the
				fortress gates, I would not recomend you to gather up a full party. Three of
				you will be enough, specially if your colleagues are either mages or wizards.
				If you don&acute;t have a tank, and therefore the pet will be the main damage
				taker, then use the Darkness-Fear combo and have the mage or wizzard to nuke
				him down. Your dutty will be keeping the giant out of mellee distance (they hit
				for 70&acute;s !!).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">What about the loot? Well, forget
				about cash loot, it just plainly sucks. But on the other hand they sometimes
				drop pieces of armour or large size weapons that can be sold at any vendor for
				very good money (20 to 50 pp). But the big prize is the <I>forest loop </I>(
				earing, AC2, wis3, agi3, dex3 ). They are a very rare drop. I&acute;d spent 4
				days hunting there and only got 2 of them. But hey, I sold them for 1500pp each
				!! Druids love those earings and they pay huge amounts of money for them. So,
				if you spend few days hunting here and you are lucky enough to get one or two
				of them, your financial problems will dissapeard straight away, won&acute;t
				they?</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Even though you can solo at lvl 29 one
				of theese giants, don&acute;t do it. They will burn most of your mana and
				medding up times will be too long. Besides they have a high MR (magic
				resistance) and if they resist two times in a row your Fear or Darkness spell,
				your pet will become nothing but dust (remember they hit very very hard indeed
				for their level), and once your pet&acute;s died, guess who is the next on the
				list<B> : ) </B>I&acute;m telling you, is far more proffitable to be in a small
				gruop pulling them fast than to try it on your on. And I like this just as
				little as you do, mate<B> : (</B></FONT></P> </TD>
