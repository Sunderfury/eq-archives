             <font face="Arial" size="4" color="#0066FF">Burning Woods</font>
             </u></b>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">In Burning Woods you
             prolly dinged 50 (If you followed my advice), and now you can push
             it a bit farther all the way till you ding 54.&nbsp;</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Basically, it will
             be the same story all over, but just with tougher mobs : Ancient
             and Verdant Giants, Sarnaks Zealot, Extremist and Avenger,
             Moldering Gorillas, Greater skellies, Ember Hornets and Wurms (not
             till level 51 when u get <i>splurt</i> and <i>envenomed bolt</i>
             -check <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells list</a></b>- cuz <i>ignite
             blood</i> wont work on them due to their high fire resistance). As
             you can see, there are still lots of blue conning mobs so you ll
             never lack of preys. Actually, I loved hunting in BW, there was <b>always</b>
             a creature by to pull away.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">There are two places
             where you can park your pet and pull to : The giants hut and the
             northern wall.</font></p>
             <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2"><b>1. <u>Giants hut</u>
              : </b>I had leveled my way thru lvls 47 - 53 here. Loot is fairly
              good, with lots of gems and weapons worth 50pp at vendors. There
              is always a prey willing to be pulled around there&nbsp; <b>:
              )&nbsp;</b><b> </b>Both from the hut itself (Giants) or from the
              forest (undeads, sarnaks, wurms and wasps). Take a look at the <b><a href="BWpost50Map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>
              to locate yourself.&nbsp;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">This place is
              excellent because it has a funny pathing, so when a mob is feared
              off just walks back and forth the same spot, without fleeing away.
              Also, if you pull to the place marked with a red cross on the <b><a href="BWpost50Map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>,
              no one mob will jump on you ganging up another.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Giants drop a nice
              loot, far better than the thougher guys in Sky Fire. Ancients drop
              spells, and the named one -Gargul- drops the <i>treewaave </i>which
              is worth 5 000 pp, not so bad uh?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Also, its worth to
              mention that there are always few groups hunting there, so if you
              DMF them, you ll get SOW and cloro, and that doesnt hurt anyone.
              Or even a 49 exp rez in case things turn sour.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2"><b>2. Northern Wall
              : </b>Basically the same stuff, but not many giants up there,
              meaning less loot. Also, there are more chances of trains, so I
              would rather go for the Giants outpost in stead.</font></p>
             </blockquote>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Pre 54, the game
             still let us solo while getting a nice exp while doing it, and
             Burning Woods is probably the last soloing zone where we will still
             be able to get better exp than grouping (in my opinion, of course).
             SkyFire post 54 is feasible, but downtimes grow longer and I dont
             really think its worthy neither in exp nor in loot terms. So enjoy
             your lasts moments as a lonely wolf before the Verant s &quot;<i>Vision</i>&quot;
             of the game -meaning to play it in group- sucks you with no way
             back possible&nbsp;<b> : (</b></font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2"><b>Tip : </b>Its
              important for you to not to worry about overdamaging your pet so
              he doesnt pinch exp. Here in BW there are plenty of preys, so its more
              profitable to share some exp with your pet (I believe it to be
              less than 50%, maybe a 33%) and to be full of mana ready to pull
              right away. What I did was:&nbsp;</font></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2"><b>Low blues : </b>Verdants,
                Gorillas, Sarnaks Avengers and Extremists. Pull with <i>bond of
                death</i>, run up to pet, sick him in, land <i>dooming darkness</i>
                on mob, <i>fear</i> it off, and just renew fear or dooming as
                needed letting the pet (<i>augmentation</i> <b>always</b> up) to
                wipe him off and medding between casts with <i>lich</i>.&nbsp;</font></p>

                darkness</i> on mob, <i>fear</i> it off, suck the crap outta him
                with <i>bond of death</i>, and renew dooming and fear as needed.
                While pet (<i>augmentation</i> <b>always</b> up) teaches him a
                lesson, you med up to full with <i>lich</i>.</font></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">So, even though
              your pet eats up a chunk of exp from you, then non-stop pullin
              will make it up, believe me.</font></p>
