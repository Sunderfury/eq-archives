      <p><b><u><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#0066FF">Freeport Arena</font></u></b></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Freeport Arena is one of those places
      that remains unknown to most players even though the fact that there is no
      where, I cant stress NO WHERE enough, in Norrath where you would level up
      from 39 to 45 as fast as you will here. Remember how quickly you hit lvl 29 in <a href="ak_anon.htm"><b>Akanon</b></a> and how amazingly
      uncamped the mechanic spawn was? Well, this is pretty much the same.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ok, in the Freeport Arena you will be
      hunting warriors from the warriors guild, which is placed in the building
      next to the Arena (see <b><a href="freeport%20arena%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>).
      Also, there are some warriors underneath guarding some prisioners. These
      warriors are lvl 34 to 36 ( I happen to recall) and therefore they shoudnt resist your spells oftenly. Actually, you can start camping them
      before lvl 39, but you would burn your whole mana bar on every fight due to
      the warriors s&nbsp; high Magic Resistance.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are four ( and only four ) warriors
      you can pull away : <i>Monia</i> and <i>Trencil</i> ( placed below the arena,
      by the jail), <i>Vun</i> ( who spawns in the building right next to the
      Arena) and <i>Jak </i>(who spawns actually inside the Arena coliseum).
      Each of them have been marked down on the <b><a href="freeport%20arena%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>
      with their iniatials.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The easiest one to pull is Jak, since he is
      already inside the amphitheatre. Monia and Trencil will come along
      together, so either you have got a mate who can take one while you deal
      with the other, or better leave them till you are acustomed with this area
      so you can take two fellows at once. When I was hunting there I used to
      take 3 at once, so dont panic, it is not that difficult. To pull these 2
      just circle around the outter perimeter of the Arena and you will see a
      back door leading to the jail (see <b><a href="freeport%20arena%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>).
      And Vun himself spawns in another building. He will come to the doorway
      walking from any of the 2 side corridors, but theres a catch here. You
      can only pull him (either cast on him or letting him see you when finally
      become KoS) exactly where the blue cross lies down on the <b><a href="freeport%20arena%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>.<b>
      </b>Why? Because if you pull him from anywhere else but there, a lvl 60
      female warrior leader called <i>Brenda</i><i> </i>will come along and she punches for double
      300s,
      and man....she is a bitch ! So stick to the blue cross while pulling Vun.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ok now, lets say you got your prey into the
      amphitheatre already. Well, just follow the yellow arrows (see <b><a href="freeport%20arena%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>)
      till you get to the very end of the upper circle. Then, when he is getting
      close to you, lets say about 30 feets away, just jump off to the lower
      circle. The warrior will have to run all the way back in order to scale
      down to the lower level using the stairs. This is probably because there is a path bug.
      DONT let him catch up with you or he will jump off
      with you to the lower level. Now that you have got about 10 seconds untill
      the guy does all the walk around, you open up the offence : Root - Scourge
      - Boild Blood - Venom of the Snake (see <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells
      list</a></b> section if needed). Reroot and recast Venon of the Snake as
      needed. Root is the base of all this technique because :</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>1.- </b>Dots max their damage when the mob is feared or stopped still</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>2.- </b>You can sit down and med some mana up with Call of bones spell</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>3.- </b>Gives you some time to run across to the oposite side of the
      Arena pit. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Everytime you stick Root on the warrior,
      run to the oposite side of the Arena so you will have few secs when he
      brakes free of the root effect to recast it quickly. Believe me, this Root
      strategy is, in this very certain hunting area, better than the Darkness -
      Fear - Pet combo, since they will tend to run outside the Arena building
      while feared and thats not what we want. Actually I didnt use my pet
      at all when I was hunting there, because when you root the warrior, he will
      melee your pet and eventually will destroy it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 1 : </b>Whenever root spell wouldnt stick on the warrior and he reaches to you, just climb up the
      stairs leading to the upper circle and again jump off at the ending. This
      will give you the chance to start all over again.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 2 : </b>You see the greenish cross
      and arrows on the <b><a href="freeport%20arena%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>
      ? There is another path finding bug. If you stand in the cross and move
      forth and back as shown, the warrior for some only-known-by-God reason
      will in stead of walking straight towards you, will hug the wall all
      around like the blue arrows state </font><font size="2" face="Arial"> (see <b><a href="freeport%20arena%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>).
      This can give you time to cast the quick 2 seconds long casting spell
      Root.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 3 : </b>Whenever you think that the
      situation is getting too freaky, or you running out of mana, or Jak spawns up
      and still you havent taken down your current prey, or the microwave
      timer rings up letting you know the pizza is ready, just hoop into the
      Arena pit itself (where the battles between PCs are fought) and let them
      to kill you without fighting em back. Why? Because the game will record
      your death as a PvP battle and hence no exp loss will be dealed !!&nbsp; I
      swear on God when I first realize about this little trick I wanted to pray
      to Innothule. This is the ever wish of any Everquest player : a hunting
      zone where, with a quick jump into the Arena, you can die peacefully
      knowing of the fact that it is exp loss free !!!&nbsp; Maaan, too great to
      bare with !!</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 4 : </b>Id keep donating few pp
      for SOW (speeding up druid, shamman and ranger buff). With SOW on you, it
      will be far safer cause you will outrun the warrior while circling around
      the Arena pit in case he reisits couple of Roots in a row.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">What about the loot ? Well, they mostly
      drop few plats. And ocassionally some steel armour pieces worth up to 4 pp
      at vendors. Not to bad, but dont expect to became Norrath s Donald
      Trump after having hunted for few levels in the Freeport Arena<b> : )</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And do not worry about faction. You dont
      get faction hits against Freeport militia or citizens, just against the
      warriors guild and against Qeynos militia, but who cares about that? You
      have always been KoS in Qeynos havent you ?&nbsp; <b>: )&nbsp; </b>Oh
      yeah, I almost forgot. Since North Freeport guards are not members of the
      militia but of the warriors guild, you will not be welcome in North
      Freeport either. Only concern about this is that the bank is within that zone, so
      you probably wont be able to bank in Freeport&nbsp;<b> : (</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u><b>Important :</b></u> You might have
      problems with any GM if by chance he sees you hunting here. Why? Because
      he might think you are exploiting the several path finding bugs reported
      in this area. Thats why I do not recomend you to abuse of either the
      under-balcony-bug (the one shown with the green cross on the <b><a href="freeport%20arena%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>)
      or the jumping-down-at-the-end-of-the-upper-circle bug (shown with yellow
      arrows on the <b><a href="freeport%20arena%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>).
      Exploitation is highly punishable, and you could get banned out of the
      game and your account ended up being cancelled off if they catch you few
      times being a naughty kid. But hey, calm down. Im here to assist you
      remember? I once talked to a GM and he stated that <i> as long as you stick to
      the Root-Dots-circling around the lower stage, you should be fine</i>
      because :&nbsp;<b> &nbsp;</b> </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b> 1.-</b>  The warrior has got the chance to catch up
        with you ( if you wouldnt root ) and hence to defend himself.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> <b>2.- </b>You do not take any
      shortcuts, meaning that you follow the very same path than the warrior
      does.&nbsp;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> If a GM ever gives you a hard time because of this, expound these
      two arguments and he might leave you alone. But if he doesnt, <u> do not
      risk it</u> : apologize and walk away, and dont you ever hunt here again
      because he might have written a brief note on your account and if few days
      later another GM walks by and sees you hunting there and decides to
      check out your records you would be in deep shit.&nbsp;</font></p>
