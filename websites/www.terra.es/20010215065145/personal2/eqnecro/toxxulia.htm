			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Just outside Paineel lies the dark,
				wet and spooky Toxxulia Forest, one of the most boring and atractionless areas
				in Norrath. But hey, you are only lvl 4, what did you expect, Disneyland?<B> :
				)</B></FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok, here you&acute;ll be headed to the
				closest knobold camp (see <B><A HREF="toxxulia_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">Toxxulia Forest map</A></B>). This camp counts with 3 lvl 3 to
				5 kobolds. You will have to group up with few other players (2 to 3 of you will
				do it) because you&acute;ve got to break the spawn in other to brake apart the
				spawn. This will be your first group experience most likely. Hunting in a group
				is not as stressful as when soloing, but still you&acute;ve got to do your job
				: send pet in, cast poison and few lifetaps, that should be enough.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Also, if you preffer to stick to
				yourself, there are several kobolds wandering arround pineel entrance. Pull
				them to the gate, dont attempt to kill them in the middle of the forest or
				you&acute;ll get jumped on by another kobolds. Skelletons will make a nice prey
				too at theese levels, but beware, those fellows hit hard indeed. </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Again, the hunting strategy will be
				lifetap-mellee fighting, but since you have just gotten Poison, Darkness and
				Fear, you could also try the Darkness-Fear combo (check out the <B><A
				HREF="strategies.htm">strategies</A></B> section), but always pulling the
				critters to the wall or the gate, never deep inside the forest.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">You&acute;ll also notice that leveling
				up now is much more slower that it was from lvl 1 to lvl 4. Don&acute;t worry,
				it&acute;s they way is supossed to be. Every higher level takes a bit more to
				be completed than the previous one. Besides, in this zone you&acute;ll be
				fighting mostly white and blue conning creatures, not yellowish, so exp will
				take its tame to raise up.</FONT></P> </TD>
