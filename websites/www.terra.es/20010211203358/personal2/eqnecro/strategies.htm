			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">As I said in the <I><B>&quot;<a href="being_a_necro.htm">Being a
             necro</a>&quot;</B></I> section, necromancers have got a wide range of spells, so there
				are several different ways your can take down a monster. Not all of them are
				suitable in every situation, so you&acute;ve got to know which one is the most
				adviceble depending on where and what are you planning to hunt. </FONT></P> 
             <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">I&acute;ll describe them out for you
             four different strategies and when to pick up one in stead of the others :
				<B><A HREF="#1. Darkness-fear-DoT combo">Darkness-Fear-DoT combo</A></B>, <B><A

             combo</a></b>.</FONT></P> 
			 <P>&nbsp;</P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial"><B><U><A
				NAME="1. Darkness-fear-DoT combo">1. Darkness-Fear-DoT
				combo</A></U>:</B></FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Now, out of all the solo hunting
				strategies in the game, this is the most outstanding of them all. Not even
				duids&acute;s kitting or mage&acute;s earth-root-caster pets can
             outbest a necro
				when using this technique. Fellows necromancers, learn this soon and feel the
				power within you !! </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">This combo is meant to be used in
				open-flat-karanas-alike zones, where you can easily spot your prey and other
				monsters wandering arround that could jump on you whilst dealing with your
				first monster.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"> Steps to follow:</FONT></P> 
			 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>1.</B> Find the propper area for
				  your level, considering what I have just said above (must be an open fields
				  zone). Check out the <B><A HREF="where_to_hunt.htm" TARGET="principal">where to
				  hunt</A></B> section in order to find out.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>2. </B>Find a clear spot within
				  that zone where no critter walks by and have your pet to guard it ( /pet guard
				  here&nbsp; command). Usually, the zone limits walls are the best place for
				  this. Also, ensure that although no monster passes by there, they do so
				  somewhere not very far away (you don&acute;t want to cross the whole zone to
				  find a prey and then to pull it along all the way back !).</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>3. </B>Spot the monster out. From
				  the distance pull it with Darkness spell (DoT and slows the monster down) and
				  run the hell back to the place you have had your pet to guard, and send him in
				  straight away ( /pet attack command)</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>4.</B> If Darkness didn&acute;t
				  get hold on the monster, recast Darkness till it sticks on it. Why is Darkness
				  do important? Because it slows it down, and therefore when you cast Fear, the
				  critter won&acute;t escape away out of your sight. Now, if it did, cast Fear
				  and see how the monster runs away from you and your pet. If Fear doesn&acute;t
				  succeed, probably the critter will pass over your pet and head staright ahead
				  towards you. Don&acute;t worry, remember darkness is on him so he won&acute;t
				  be able to run any fast, so just run backwards a bit and recast
				  Fear.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>5.</B> Cast away every single DoT
				  spell you have memorized. This will slowly reduce its HPs (hit points). DoTs
				  are necros&acute;s main weapon. It might not look as impressive as
				  wizzard&acute;s or mages&acute;s nukes, but believe me, they are far more
				  effective.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>6. </B>Now, your dutty is to wait
				  till Fear spell wears off. It has a random longevity, deppending on the
				  critter&acute;s level and some othe factors. So just keep an eye on it. When it
				  wears off, recast it quickly since the prey won&acute;t anylonger stick to your
				  pet but yourself !! </FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>7.</B> Once Fear is recast, just
				  finish the monster off with the lifetap series spells or with whatever nuke
				  (direct damage spell) you&acute;ve got in that moment.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>8.</B> Type /cheer command, sit
				  down in the inicial spot (where pet is guarding) and meditate mana up till
				  full, smoke a cigarette and get ready for next battle. You are powerfull necro
				  <B>: )</B></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B><I><U>Advantages of this
				strategy</U></I>:</B> It&acute;s just an amazing one. If everything goes as
				it&acute;s supposed to, nor you or your pet will be hit even once !! On top of
				that, it kills the mobs very quickly (1 minute or so per battle) and you
				won&acute;t need to burn out the whole mana bar, meaning shorter medding
				downtimes.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B><I><U>Drawbacks</U></I>:</B> Very
				few : The area must be outdoors and as flat as possible. Why not in dungeons?
				Because if you cast fear on the monster, it will start running thru the tunnels
				and probably you&acute;ll loose its track, and when Fear wears off, it&acute;ll
				be back with a gang of its mates running nastily towards you with no good
				intentions at all !!. Another inconvenient could be that Fear and specially
				Darkness spells have got a high resistance rate, so if the prey you are to
				fight&acute;s got a high MR (magic resistance) you could be in problems because
				they&acute;ll keep resisting your spells. Avoid such situation and go in stead
				for low magic resistance ones. In the <B><A HREF="where_to_hunt.htm"
				TARGET="principal">where to hunt</A></B> section I have chosen preys for you
				with low MR ( hey, I&acute;m a nice guy, am I not? ). Finally, I must mention
				that while the critter is running away due to the Fear spell efects, another
				crittet could jump in the fight if it was passing by, or if Darkness brakes
				free while monster&acute;s Feared away. That why is important to choose a quite
				spot to pull your preys upon.</FONT></P>

			 <P><U><B><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial"><A
				NAME="2. SoW-Darkness-DoT combo:">2. SoW-Darkness-DoT
				combo:</A></FONT></B></U></P> 
			 <P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="3">Ok, I acknowledge it, this is not a
				necro&acute;s original strategy. It&acute;s just a plain copy of druids&acute;s
				kitting technique, but hey, It&acute;s worth to give it a try, aint
				it?</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="3">Well, first of all you gotta know
				that SoW (Spirit of Wolf spell) is a druid&acute;s, shamman&acute;s and high
				lvl ranger&acute;s spells that allows you to almost double your running speed
				up. </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="3">Steps to be followed:</FONT></P> 
			 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>1. </B>Much alike the previous
				  combo, you&acute;ll need a openfield zone in order to run arround.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>2. </B>Ask any kind druid or
				  shamman to cast SoW on you. You might have to tip him (2 pp should be
				  enough).</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>3. </B>Type &acute;/pet no
				  taunt&acute;&nbsp; in order to obligate him not to stop the critter on its way
				  towards you. </FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>4.</B> Spot any clear, mob-free
				  area and pull the monster with Darkness. Send pet in straight off.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>5.</B> Now, cast away all your
				  DoTs. This, along with the /pet no taunt&nbsp; command, will make the critter
				  to aggro on you like a maniac.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>6.</B> Run forrest, run!!. With
				  the SoW and Darkness effects combined up, you can easily outrun it. Picture
				  this : You&acute;r running arround in wide circles, critter is following you
				  full DoTed, and pet&acute;s kicking its back (actually the pet could be
				  considered as another DoT in this strategy).</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>7. </B>The main issue will be to
				  keep darkness up, and renew DoTs as needed. If darkness wears off and you
				  don&acute;t renew it, your pet won&acute;t be able to follow the critter and
				  you&acute;ll have to enlarge your running circles, and that&acute;s dangerous
				  cause there&acute;ll be more posibilities for another monster to join in the
				  train, and you definitily don&acute;t want that !!</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>8.</B> Eventually, the monster
				  will drop dead to floor due to your nasty powefull
				  DoTs.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B><I><U>Adventages</U></I>:</B>
				Again, you should be able to finish the battle with your HP bar full up, and as
				long as SoW&acute;s effects are up, you won&acute;t be in real danger since you
				can outrun the critter in case something turns out wrong.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B><I><U>Drawbacks</U></I>: </B>There
				are more drawbacks than in the previously shown combo : First, you need an
				outdoors zone. Second, you need to get a druid or shamman to cast SoW on you
				(not always easy to get because this spell is highly demmanded and SoW casters
				may get annoyed of people keep begging for it). Third, it will take longer time
				than the Darkness-Fear-DoT combo to kill the monster. Fourth, you&acute;ll burn
				much more mana too, meaning longer medding downtimes. Fifth, and this is the
				main one, since you are running arround, another critters could join up the
				first one on its way towards you, and then you&acute;ll have an ugly train on
				you. Is this comes to happend, do not hesitate : head to zone staight away, or
				cast either gate or feign death (check the <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm"
				TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> section if you don&acute;t know theese
				spells). One way to solve this out is to have the widest view possible hitting
				in the keybord F9 and moving the mouse till you find the propper angle. This
				will allow you to have a large oversight of the area you are running
				in.</FONT></P>

				NAME="3. Lifetap series mellee fighting :">3. Lifetap series mellee
				fighting:</A></FONT></B></U></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Lifetap series are one of the main
				series of the necromancer&acute;s armaments. They &acute;steal&acute; a certain
				amount of the monster&acute;s HP to be added on yourself. Check the <B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm" TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> section if
				needed.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">This technique is only feasible in
				early levels since later on the critters will hit just too hard to handle it.
				Using this strategy you&acute;ll put yourself into mellee distance and
				therefore assume that you&acute;ll get hit by the monster you are hunting in
				that moment. But hey, an adventurer&acute;s life is always risky, isnt
				it?</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Steps to follow :</FONT></P> 
			 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>1.</B> Spot your next pray, no
				  matter whether inside a dungeon or outdoors. Only requirement is it to be
				  alone.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>2. </B>Have your pet to attack
				  him.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>3. </B>Cast Siphon strengh (check
				  <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm" TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more
				  info) in order to debuff him, so his blows won&acute;t hurt that much. Now,
				  count few seconds and cast one DoT. Count again few more seconds and cast a
				  second one. This is because if you cast few spells on a row on a critter,
				  it&acute;ll will forget about your pet and will focus its attacks on you. So
				  let the pet to take some damage, but do not let him die at any rate.</FONT></P>
				
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>4. </B>When your pet&acute;s life
				  is more than half gone, it&acute;s time for you to put your boxing gloves on
				  and get into mellee distance. It would be adviceable for you to be brandishing
				  any kind of weapon (since this strategy is only meant for low levels, I&acute;d
				  go for a runed totem staff - DMG 9, DLY 36, 2 hands, price 15 pp) and use it
				  against your prey in autoattack mode (press &acute;a&acute; button in the
				  keyboard). The monster will forget about your pet, turn arround and face you
				  within seconds.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>5. </B>Now, it&acute;s all about
				  timing. If you try to cast lifetap with no timing sense, the monster&acute;s
				  blows with brake up your concentartion stopping your casting. What you&acute;ve
				  got to do is to hold on till it hits you, and straight after cast your lifetap
				  series spell. Most of the times you&acute;ll have time enough to cast it
				  succeesfully between blows. This way you will recover back some of the HP lost
				  out of the moster&acute;s strokes.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>6. </B>If you see that your HP
				  are dropping down too fast and that you won&acute;t be able to make it, just
				  step back few meters and let the pet to take some more damage while you cast
				  few more lifetaps. With this new extra life you have just gained, walk again
				  into mellee (by this time your pet&acute;s HP bar should be dangerously
				  aproaching its very end).</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>7. </B>When everything is
				  finished, sit down and meditate long minutes. Have your pet to sit down too (
				  /pet sit down command) and he&acute;ll start regenerate his own HP much
				  fater.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B><U><I>Adventages</I></U>:
				</B>Actually, since low levels DoTs really suck, this will be your only way to
				hunt untill you reach level 12, when you get two powerfull DoTs (Engulfing
				darkness and Heat blood) and then you&acute;ll be able to use the first combo
				descrived above. Also, you don&acute;t cast Fear with this strategy, so you can
				use it in whatever zone you want to hunt in, and thats always nice.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B><I><U>Drawbacks</U></I>:
				</B>Necromancers are casters, and as casters they haven&acute;t got plenty of
				HP . Therefore, getting&nbsp; yourself into mellee is always risky. Also,
				you&acute;ve got to have the timing practiced, or the monster won&acute;t let
				you cast those lovely refreshing lifetap spells away. Finally, since you and
				your pet will get pretty kicked, medding up times will be a bit longer (HP
				regeneration is slower than mana points regeneration), but as i said before,
				there&acute;s not really any other way of hunting at low
				levels.</FONT></P> 
			 <P>&nbsp;</P><P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u><a name="4. Root - DoT combo">4.
             Root - DoT combo</a></u> : </b></font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2">This
             strategy is basically the low level wizards s soloing technique :
             Root, load you damage spells, reroot as needed; just Dotting in
             stead of nuking away.</font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2">The
             Root - Dot combo is only usuable for mid/high level necros because
             we get our first root line spell at level 34. Also, and as opposed
             to the <b><a href="#1. Darkness-fear-DoT combo">darkness-fear combo</a></b>,
             you WILL get hit while using it, and therefore a high channeling
             (meaning high level) will be most useful in order to continue your
             casting even though absorbing some blows.</font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2">Ok,
             this is how it works : </font></P>
             <blockquote>
              <P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1.</b> Spot a prey and pull it
              (with a DoT if you have SOW - J/boots or with lvl 12 darkness

              </font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>2.</b> Now <i>Root</i>

              till the end.</font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>6.</b>
              Renew DoTs if needed.</font></P>
             </blockquote>
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2">As you see, no pet should be
             summoned if using this way of soloing. Why? Cuz if the mob hits you
             even once and you root him, your pet will jump on him and will get
             himself wiped out in melee.</font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2">There
             is a tricky issue about which DoTs should you use. Root line spells
             ought to be checked by the mob every tick in order to determine the
             spell s duration. This means that the spell has a chance to wear
             off every 6 seconds. Well, any Direct Damage (DD) harm will
             increase such a chance sensibly. Since some DoTs have an initial DD
             component (venom based DoTs on top of them all), I wouldnt recomend
             you to use them because they will most likely free the mob off the
             root s grip. Anyway, if you are very stubborn and want to land a
             venom based DoT (<i>Venom of the Snake</i> or <i>Envenomed Bolt</i>.
             check <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells list</a>)</b>, always
             cast them the last ones and with plenty of space in case Root
             brakes, so you have a space gap to recast it out.</font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2">As
             I said before, you will get hurt while using this combo. Root line
             of spells has a higher resistance rate than Darkness - Fear (or at
             least in my personal opinion), and therefore if the mob resists it,
             he will get within melee distance and hit you hard. Root has a
             short casting time (2 secs only) so you might be able to cast it
             off between blows, or even if you take one punch or two. But at any
             rate be certain that there is a risk that the mob is kicking you
             interrupting all your castings. Of course, after succesfully having
             landed root on him, you will have to lifetap to get your health
             back up (which means more mana burning and longer downtimes).</font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2">The
             only way to Root - Dot a mob without being hurt is to have plenty
             of free space so you can always gain a safe gap between you two.
             But then, if you had that space, you would go for the <b><a href="#1. Darkness-fear-DoT combo">darkness-fear
             combo</a></b>, wouldnt you? Alternatively you can constantly recast
             Root every 20 secs so you asure that he will be rooted the whole
             battle long, but thats a bit mana expensive.</font></P>
             <blockquote>
              <P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>T</b><b>ip 1 :</b> I
             would advice you to have always SOW-J/boots ( in case you cant cast
             off root while being hit by the mob ) and a cleric HP buff (to have
             extra HP since you will get some beating) up.</font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tip
              2 : </b>I remember I once dual used this strategy with another
              necro good mate of mine and it turned out being an excellent
              hunting evening. We would land two DoTs each (so not to much mana
              wasting) and whenever the mob would resist the root and stick to
              one of us, the other one would root hence saving the other s butt.
              If you happen to have a necro parter, Im sure you will like this

             </blockquote>
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2">As moral, I would tell you to only
             use this hunting combo on mobs with not many HPs (so with, lets
             say, three DoTs they are done) or with mobs that aint very strong
             (meaning they hit like a posh Beverly Hills lady). Otherwise, I
             dont believe its really very feasible with tough mobs since they
             will dry off your mana pool or your health bar !!</font></P><P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><u><i>Adventages</i></u>

             outdoors when <b><a href="#1. Darkness-fear-DoT combo">darkness-fear</a>
