			 <P><B>West Karanas</B> zone entrance is on the eastern wall of
				<B>Qeynos Hills</B> (<B><A HREF="qeynos_hills_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">Qeynos
				Hills map</A></B>). But before starting to head towards this zone, you might
				preffer to hit lvl 8 either in <B><A HREF="qeynos_sewers.htm">Qeynos
				sewers</A></B> or <B><A HREF="blackburrow.htm">BlackBurrow</A></B> because
				you&acute;ll have to pass close to some non-amiably guards and NPC in the
				Qeynos Hills zones in order to zone to WK (West Karanas). Why would you want to
				be lvl 8? Because at lvl 8 you get <I>Gather Shadows</I> spells (invisibility
				effect) and that could help you avoiding the guards (check <B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm">spells list</A></B> for Gather Shadows info).</P> 
			 <P>Ok, first thing you gotta know is that in my opinion WK is the
				largest zone in game. It&acute;s huge, so prepare yourself for long walks.
				Also, this is a wide level range area, so at your level some creatures will con
				green, and some very very red. Another hazzard is that some animals just wander
				arround like lions, bears, etc. so you&acute;ve got to keep your eyes wide open
				or they will jump on you while medding or fighting another monster.</P> 
			 <P>The good part of this zone is that you can hunt solo or in groups
				if you wish to. I&acute;ll explain now :</P> 
			 <P>At level 7, there are plenty of different animals you can solo :
				Lioness, young lions, giant beattles, giant spider (watch out with theese ones,
				they poisson you) and farmers. Apart from the farmers, the rest of them just
				walk arround in no certain spot, so just try to spot them out and kill them.
				The farmers are camps (they spawn in the very same place always and don&acute;t
				move away from there). They are lvl 6-7 and are great to kill because of : good
				exp, good loot and good faction standings with Qeynos guards !! Here would be
				where I would hunt in West Karanas. The only problems is that they spawn close
				to the bandits (lvl 9-11) and if they attack you, you could be in real
				problems. Take a look to the <B><A HREF="west_karanas_map.htm "
				TARGET="_blank">WK map</A></B> to find out where to find the farmers and
				bandits.</P> 
			 <P>Once you get to lvl 9, go to the bandits camps or to the undead
				camp (green squared zone in <B><A HREF="west_karanas_map.htm "
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>) to kill zombies with your lvl 8 40 HP nuke vs
				undead <I>Ward Undead </I>(check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm">spells
				list</A></B> for more info). Theese guys are lvl 9 too, and I happen to recall
				that they cast dissease (spell that doesn&acute;t allow your HP to regenerate
				back up and lasts ages to wear off), so if you are in a group with a cleric or
				druid who can cast <I>cure disseas</I>e spell, go for those zombies. If not,
				keep away and stick to bandits. Or another possibility is to seek out for
				roaming lions. They hit hard, but hey, so do you !! The undead camp and
				specially the bandits camps are heavily camped, so probably you&acute;ll have
				to join in the group if they accept you. If they don&acute;t, still you can
				always go for blue conning giant beattles, lions, lionesses, giant spiders,
				etc.</P> 
			 <P>The main drawback I could point out in West Karanas is that is
				very far away from your binding point in North Qeynos, and on top of that the
				zone is quite large itself. This means that everytime you die, you&acute;ll
				spend at least 10 minutes till you recover your corpse back. Tip: do not die
