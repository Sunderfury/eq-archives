				16)</U></B></FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">South Karanas zone is just next to
				North Karanas, crossing thru the stone bridge guarded by guards. Watch out
				because I&acute;ve heard that they can see thru Gather Shadows spell, I&acute;m
				not sure. Just in case they do, ask for SoW and run the hell thru the
				guards&acute;s post and don&acute;t stop till you hit the zone which is in the
				middle of the bridge. Once you have zone into SK (south karanas) there
				won&acute;t be any patrolling guards anymore.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In SK there are two places you could
				go hunting, depending if you preffer to solo or to group up with some other
				players. Of course, my advice is to be on your own.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If you decide to solo, then your next
				preys would be the elephant calves (check <B><A HREF="south_karanas_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> to find them on the red squared areas). They go
				from lvl 10 to 14, so you&acute;ll get good exp till lvl 14-15. Only thing here
				to worry about is that the walk in crowds so you&acute;ve got to pull one
				without having their much larger mum along too. Once you spot a lonely calf,
				pull it towards a clear area an kill it pleassently there. They drop tusks,
				which are useless apart from few golds at the vendor placed at the very top of
				the aviak village (check <B><A HREF="south_karanas_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>). One tip here : do not fall down from the top
				floor of the village or you&acute;ll become a shapeless-smashed-potatoes-alike
				mass on the floor out of the 500 HP damage hit !! Once you reach level 15, try
				to go for the calves&acute;s parents : the elephants. Theese ones are much
				tougher and some of them will con red to you. Avoid those ones because they
				could resist your Darkness and Fear spells. Stick to yellows or lower and
				you&acute;ll do just fine. Again, same problem than before : you must pull them
				away to a non-crowded area.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Also, keep in mind that while fighting
				with either any calf or elephant, a roaming lion may walk by and jump on you
				too. Lions are lvl 10ish, so they are not too tough. Just Fear it away and
				continue your dance with the elephant. By the time the Fear effects wear off,
				you should be already cutting the tusks off the elephant&acute;s
				corpse!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If you happen to pull two elephants,
				don&acute;t try to take them both down. Just let the pet deal desperately with
				them while you gain some valuable seconds to run the hell away towards the zone
				(Lake Rathe zone should be the closest one).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">But if you preffer to group up with
				some mates, then your place is at the base of the main ramp of the Aviak
				village (blue squared area on the map). Here you&acute;ll face may kind of the
				commonly called &acute;<I>birds&acute; </I>(Aviaks) along with a wide level
				range groups. They go from the skinny Aviak Egret (lvl 13 to 15) to the very
				powerful Aviak Avocet (lvl 28 to 30). Of course, at this level you can only aim
				to the Egrets. Be very carefull not to pull by mistake any bigger fellow
				&acute;cause they hit very hard. Loot on the Aviaks are slightly better than on
				the elephants, but still nothing really speciall.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">At level 15, and considering you are
				in a group, you should move on and hunt the Aviak Darter (lvl 15 to 18). Same
				stuff as the Egrets, just a bit more bulky bird <B>: )</B></FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">I don&acute;t particulary like this
				Aviak village as my hunting place. Why? Because there are many kinds of Aviaks,
				and some of them are very very nasty indeed. And since they all spawn toghether
				within a 100 feet wide area, there is a real chance of you pulling the wrong
				class of bird along with the one you initially meant to pull, leading a
				supossely easy battle into a Quentin Tarantino&acute;s savage slaughtering
				scene. Being frank, rather stick to the elephants or go to the far more
				adviceable zone of <B><A HREF="oasis.htm">Oasis of Marr</A></B>.</FONT></P>
