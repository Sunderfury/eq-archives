			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Well, well, well. You have chosen to
				be a necromancer, haven&acute;t you? First of all, you gotta know that you have
				chosen right! Necromancers are indeed the most powerful class in the game, no
				doubt about that. But as any type of power, you must know how to use
             handle it. </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">A necro&acute;s main way of hunting is
				soloing. That&acute;s what they do best. Mages and druids are also fairly good
				soloers, but none like the necro. Our spells combo allows us to take easily down
				an even or yellow conning preys, even low red ones if we know what we
				are doing. Besides, we have got an amazingly wide spells range, so we&acute;ve
				got many ways to use our skills in combat. In the other hand, there&acute;s one
				big issue against us : we are not meant to hunt in groups. I mean, we can but
				we won&acute;t be the most desireble class for the other players to group up
				with us. In stead, they&acute;d rather go for a cleric or a tank-class.
				Why is that? many reassons : Our DD (direct damage spells) cannot be compared
				with mages&acute;s or wizzards&acute;s. We are no healer (even though we do
				can heal a bit). Nor us or our pets can take large amounts of damage as tanks
				do. And on top of that our DoTs (Damage over Time spells) are not the best
				weapon in full parties&acute;s hunting because the time that a combat takes to
				be finished is so short that those DoTs wont do their full damage. So
				don&acute;t expect loads of parties to come along and cry for you to
				join them up. But hey!! You are a necro, who the hell needs a group when you
				can kill them off by yourself !!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Another drawback is that you&acute;ll
				ve KOS (kill on sight) in most of the cities of Norrath, so guards and NPCs
				(non-player characters) will tend to wipe their ass with your robe.
             Sooner or later you&acute;ll learn how to avoid this nuisances and how to make your way
				throught such cities and non-amiably NPCs.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Just in case you need somebody
				else&acute;s point of view about how you should play your necromancer, you
             might
				want to check out the following websites. They are all much prettier, but they
				won&acute;t speak up as wisely and clearly as this one <b> : )</b>&nbsp;

			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">This is my personal website, meaning
				that everything exposed here is absolutly in my very humble opinion. I could be
				wrong in any of the advices and tips I &acute;ll describe in this web, but I
				honestly believe they are accurate and that you can really do well following
				them throughout all your levels.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Also, I have assumed you are acustomed
				with the basic rules of EverQuest such as sense heading, how to orientate
				yourself in your travels around Norrath, how to use the different chat
				commands, what is research and what is specialization, how to assign points to
				the different skills, bank business, how to talk to NPCs, /location command,
				guilds membership, etc. It would take me ages to explain those stuffs, and what
				the hell, that&acute;s what the reference guide book is for !!</FONT></P> 
             <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Well, I hope this guide you are just
				about to read will be able to help you to level up faster and safer. Anyway, if you need any farther information, or if
				there&acute;s something shown in this web that you don&acute;t
             understand, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mrlondoner@hotmail.com"><b>mrlondoner@hotmail.com</b></a></FONT></P>
