			 <P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If you visit any
				which-race-should-I-go-for? forum arround, you&acute;ll notice that
				there&acute;s no general agreement about which race is the best over the rest.
				Some people say erudites are the best due to their high intelligence. Some
				would say dark elves are the top of the rank because of their high dextrerity
				and their natural ultravision. Some others would go for the gnome, sice
				they&acute;ve got a good overall starting points. Even humans&acute;ve got
				their own supporters &acute;cause of the experience bonus. As I said before, no
				race stands on top of the rest.</FONT></P> 
             <P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">But since this is my
				page, I&acute;ll feel free to give you my choice: go for the erudite!! Why?
				Well, because they start with a maxxed intelligence of 142 (if you distribute
				as many points as you can to raise up intelligence) and that&acute;s exactly
				what you want, believe me. If you do so, you will have 5 remaining points left.
				You could use them to raise either agility (to avoid getting hit) or strength
				(in order to be able to carry more weight on you). I&acute;d put them to
             agility, because at low levels you have to melee, and some dodging
             wont hurt.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">But now, why is so
				important to have a high base intelligence? Well, more intelligence means more
				mana (till you reach 200, when any farther intelligence will hardly increase
				mana a bit), and more mana means that you can cast more spells in a row.
				Intelligence is crucial for casters since our power&acute;s based on our
				spells. Now, you can increase intelligence with magical int-bonus items, which
				some of them are not cheap or easy to get at all. Your aim is to max
				intelligence up to 200, and therefore you&acute;ll have to shop arround trying
				to acquire plenty of these items. Some people say its easy to get the money to
				buy all those items, so you can have an impressive equipment fairly quickly.
				Lets say you choose to be a dark elf, or even a human. Even if you spend most
				of your starting points to intelligence, still it&acute;ll stand bellow 120, so
				you&acute;ve got to buy a bunch of theese magical artefacts. In order to get an
				over-80-intelligence-bonus-items you may easily be looking for over 20000
				platinium coins, and that is no easy task to achieve. Its true that when you
				are in your forties (lvl 40+), then you will be earning money much much faster,
				but before that your intelligence&acute;ll be too low and won&acute;t be able
				to cast many spells without having to keep medding up oftenly. I&acute;m
				telling you, get yourself an erudite, max up your intelligence, and don&acute;t
				worry about having to save up all your earning cause of the damn expensive
				intelligence bonus items. And whenever the hell you become rich, then
				you&acute;ll be able to spend your money in whatever items you fancy, not only
				intelligence bonus items because you will have alredy reached 200 !!</FONT></P>
