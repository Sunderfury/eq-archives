			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">BB (BlackBurrow) is in the estern wall
				of Qeynos hills (check <B><A HREF="qeynos_hills_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">Qeynos
				Hills map</A></B> to get there)</FONT>.</P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">BB is a wild zone, with plenty of
				deadly trains of furious gnolls and it&acute;s almost impossible to solo here.
				That&acute;s why you must shop arround for a group if you&acute;r planning to
				hunt in BB. Believe me, if you try to solo here, you&acute;ll die oftenly and
				will have to walk all your way back from your binding point in North Qeynos. I
				had tried myself to solo here at level 8 for 1 whole week and died and walked
				that trip so many times that finally I had to quit and shout out for a
				group.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">At level 7, and once you have gotten
				into a full group, hunt in the red squared area in the upper level of the <B><A
				HREF="blackburrow_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">Blackburrow map</A></B>. This is a
				good idea &acute;cause the zone to Qeynos hills is just few steps away in case
				you get jumped on by a train and your group can&acute;t keep it under
				control.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">When you make your way to lvl 8, and
				after buying you new lvl 8 spells (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm">spells
				list</A></B>) in the necromancers&acute;s guild in Qeynos sewers (check <B><A
				HREF="qeynos_sewers_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map of the sewers</A></B>), you
				can take you group, or look for a new one, to the lower level. I have drawn 2
				blue squared areas in the <B><A HREF="blackburrow_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> where you should be fine hunting gnolls, burly
				gnolls and patrolling gnolls. The main problem here is that if a huge
				gnoll-orient-express-alike-train comes up, you&acute;ll have to run the ramp
				all the way up towards the upper level and then zone to Qeynos Hills while
				those ugly gnolls kick your butt.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">At lvl 9 there is another posibility,
				and hey, here you&acute;ll hunt by yourself !! It&acute;s the snakes&acute;pit
				(greenish squared area in the mid level. Check the <B><A
				HREF="blackburrow_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> out). This snakes are
				lvl 8 to 10 and hit very hard, but they are great exp indeed and on top of that
				they drop <I>snake&acute;s fang, </I>which can be used as piercing weapon (DMG
				5, DLY 24). Theese are great pet weapons, and you can sell them to any vendor
				for over 1 pp !! If you decide to solo this snakes, I swear on God you&acute;ll
				love the exp and the loot.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Now you&acute;r level 10, aren&acute;t
				you? Ok, get yourself back in a group and lets kick some big gnolls&acute;s
				asses : Gnoll shamman, gnoll guardsman and gnoll commander (this fellow is lvl
				13 to 15 and is very strong, watch out). Again, in the <B><A
				HREF="blackburrow_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> you&acute;ll see some
				yellow squared areas, and there&acute;s exactly where you should go at lvl 10.
				Same tactics as couple of levels ago : Full party, fast pulling, send pet in
				and lifetap the gnoll off. Easy job.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If you have been a smart apprentice,
				you&acute;ll hit level 12 in few days since you arrived to BB. Go again to the
				Qeynos sewers (<B><A HREF="qeynos_sewers_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map of the
				sewers</A></B>)&nbsp; to purchase you proudly earned new spells (<B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm">spells list</A></B>) and let&acute;s move on mate
				!!</FONT></P> </TD>
