				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"> <B>1.</B><B>Cavorting Bones</B>:
				  Summons a lvl 1 warrior class skeleton pet. As you&acute;ll notice throughout
				  your levels, the pet is what makes a necro a real killing machine. This spell
				  should be the first thing you spend your first gold in. A must have. Requires 1
				  bone chip as component each casting. You can get them from decaying
                skeletons. More information at the <b><a href="Pet%20guide.htm">pet
                guide</a></b>.<BR> <BR> <B>2. Coldlight: </B>Summons a dim light. Very useful since
				  erudites are virtually blind at night.<BR> <BR> <B>3. Disease Cloud:
				  </B>Diseases the target. Our first DoT. It does 1 Hp damage every tick (six
				  seconds). Also a 5 Hp starting hit. It&acute;s not much, but still worthy to
				  buy<BR> <BR> <B>4. Invisibility to undead: </B>Makes target invisible to all
				  undead. A must have. Allows you to pass throught an undead area without being
				  disturbed.<BR> <BR> <B>5. Lifetap: </B>Steals about 5 HP life from target and
				  gives to self. You start with this spell in your inventory.<BR> <BR> <B>6.
				  Locate Corpse: </B>Points you in the direction of the target's corpse. A very
				  useful spell indeed in wide large unknown areas where you could easily walk
				  arround ten minutes trying to spot out your corpse. Also you can make some
				  money finding other player&acute;s corpses for a tip. They&acute;d pay, believe
				  me.<BR> <BR> <B>7. Minor Shielding: </B> Casted on self, increases hitpoints by
				  10 and armour class by 5. It lasts 27 minutes. This extra bonus may make the
				  difference between live or die. Always have it up. You start with this spell on
				  your inventory.<BR> <BR> <B>&nbsp;8. Reclaim energy:</B> Casted on summoned
				  skeleton pet to destory it and reclaim mana. Useless spells. Bone chips are
				  precious and you better sit down for 1 min and get the mana back rather than
				  sacrifice your beloved pet. Don&acute;t buy it unless you got
                extra cash to spare.<BR> <BR> <B>9. Sense the Dead :
				  </B>Points you in the direction of the nearest undead creature. I use it when I
				  want to find decaying skells in order to get some bone chips. That&acute;s the
				  only use it&acute;s got.<BR> <BR> <B>10. Siphon Strength: </B>Takes 10 strength
				  points from the target and gives to self. Very useful spell since at low levels
				  you&acute;ve got to mellee (it will reduce down your opponent&acute;s blows
				  damage). Also can be of use when you are encumbered (carrying too much weight)
				  so you&acute;ll add extra 10 bonus to your base streght.<BR> </FONT>

				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"> <B>1. Clinging Darkness: </B>Damage
				  over time and slows target. First on the Darkness series, one of the
				  necromancer&acute;s top rank spell series. Will damage the mob for 30 Hp in 36
				  secs, apart from slowing down its movement speed. A must have.&nbsp;<BR> <BR>
				  <B>2. Endure Cold:</B> Increases your cold resistance by 20. I never really
				  used this spell since at this level no critter casts cold-based spells. Only
				  use is in a duel against mage or wizzard. Save the money if you ain&acute;t
				  rich.<BR> <BR> <B>3. Fear:</B> Causes NPC to run away for a random period of
				  time. This is THE spell. Main necro&acute;s weapon. Buy it, buy it, buy it
				  !!<BR> <BR> <B>4. Gate: </B> Returns you to home point (wherever
                you are bound). This is
				  the main escaping way you&acute;ve got at this level. A must have if you
				  don&acute;t want to die oftenly. If things turn sour, step
                back and let the pet get the last blows while you <i>Gate</i>
                away.<BR> <BR> <B>5. Grim Aura:</B> Your attack
				  rating increases by 5. Needed since at this level you gotta
				  mellee<BR><BR><B>6. Leering Corpse:</B> Summons a lvl 3 to 5 skeleton
				  pet. Always you should have your pet spells update. Needs 1 bone chip per
				  casting. More information at the <b><a href="Pet%20guide.htm">pet
                guide</a></b>.<BR> <BR> <B>7. Lifespike: </B>Steals about 10 hitpoints from target
				  and gives to self. A must have.<BR> <BR> <B>8. Numb the Dead :</B> Lowers
				  aggro, frenzy and reaction on the undead. Very interesting spell. If there are
				  2 undead creatures toghether, cast this spell on one and pull the other (the
				  first one will stand still). Only try this spell on blue conning undeads since
				  it&acute;s got a high magic resistance rate.<BR> <BR> <B>9. Poison Bolt:
				  </B>Poisons the target. Another DoT. It initially hits for 6 Hp and afterwards
				  deals 35 Hp damage over 35 seconds. Goodie !<BR> <BR> <B>10. True North: </B>
				  Face to the North. I&acute;d rather practice the sense heading skill. But could
				  be useful if you&acute;ve got plenty golds to spare.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

                <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"> <BR> <BR> <B>2. Dark Empathy:</B> Gives
                a certain amount of your
				  hitpoints to another. Kinda healing, but since it takes your own Hp, I
				  wouldn&acute;t bother with it. It&acute;s the oposite of a lifetap series
				  spell. Only use in very critical moments.<BR> <BR> <B>3. Dark Pact: </B> Drain four hitpoints to gain
                two mana
				  each period. It works the best while medding. First of an awesome series that will
				  certanly cut down medding up times. A must have. Also keep an eye &acute;cause
				  it drains your HP, so you could die if you forget this spell
                up and let it do
				  its effects for ever. I have died myself few times out of this shit !<BR> <BR>
				  <B>4. Deadeye:</B> Gives infravision and the ability to see invisible beings.
				  Great spell, you ain&acute;t blind anylonger mate.<BR> <BR> <B>5. Gather
				  Shadows: </B> Makes you invisible. Oh boy, what can I tell you about this
				  spell. It&acute;s lovely and will allow you to walk throught places forbidden
				  for you. Be aware it doesn&acute;t work on undeads (that&acute;s why<i> invis vs
				  undeads</i> is for).<BR> <BR> <B>6. Impart Strength:</B> Take strength from self
				  and give to target. Opossite to siphon strenght. Only point I find to this
				  spell is to power your pet up, but I wouldn&acute;t really go for it.<BR> <BR>
				  <B>7. Lesser Shielding: </B> Adds 30 to your maximum hitpoints and extra 9
				  armour class. Also extra 10 vs magic bonus. A must have. The shielding series
				  is the best deffence you can get when soloing. As most shielding spells, you
				  won&acute;t find them in the necro guild. Ask a mage, wizzie or druid mate to
				  purchase it for you in their guilds.<BR> <BR> <B>8. Mend Bones:</B> Heals the
				  undead target, so you can heal your pet. Good when the combat is finished in
				  irder to reduce medding down times, but while fighting you better spend your
				  mana in a DoT , lifetap or Fear spell rather than in this one.<BR> <BR> <B>9.
				  Shadow Step:</B> Small random self teleport. The higher level, the farther you
				  get. At lvl 8, you may get teleported 60 feet away. This is a great escaping
				  spell if combined with Gate. Gate take full 4 secs to be casted out, and during
				  that time the mob will hit you breaking your casting. Now, Shadow Step only
				  takes 1 sec. So cast SS, gain some meters from the mob, and cast gate straight
				  afterwards. The higher level you are, the farther it takes
                you.You&acute;ll get out of many problems with this spell. Also,
                its the best PvP spell against melee classes. <b>Tip</b> :
				  Don&acute;t cast in an area with lava pools, or cliffs or stuff like that.<BR>
				  <BR> <B>10. Vampiric Embrace:</B> Remove hitpoints from target and give to
				  self. This is not a lifetap spell. You cast it on you and randomly it releases
				  a 22 HP lifetap effect if you are within mellee distance. But it doesn&acute;t
				  do often. My advice, don&acute;t spend a copper on this spell. It just
				  doesn&acute;t work <B>: (</B><BR> <BR> <B>11. Ward Undead:</B> Does a high
				  amount of damage (40 HP) to an undead creature. A highly mana efficient spell.
				  If you fight undeads, don&acute;t hesitate, blast them away with this
				  spell.</FONT></P> </BLOCKQUOTE>

				  skeleton pet. 2 bone chips needed per casting. More
                information at the <b><a href="Pet%20guide.htm">pet guide</a></b>.<BR> <BR> <B>3. Endure
				  Disease:</B> Increases your disease resistance. Very useful when fighting
				  agaist disease casting cretures such as rabid wolves, rats or zombies.<BR>
				  <BR> <B>4. Engulfing Darkness:</B> Slows target movement and does damage over
				  time (110 Hp in 60 secs). Next darkness update. A must have indeed. Ashame
				  it&acute;s got a high magic resistance ratio.<BR> <BR> <B>5. Heat Blood:
				  </B>Does damage over time to target (almost 200 HP in 60 secs). This spell will
				  be your main attacking weapon for the next 12 levels. Besides, almost never
				  gets resisted.<BR> <BR> <B>8. Leach:</B> Lifteap Damage over Time (72 HP in
				  only 45 secs). Another good healing up method. Stack <i>Engulfing
                Darkness</i>, <i> Heat
				  blood</i> and <i>Leach</i> and your preys will drop down to your feet. And even once the
				  mob has died, the leach still procs its effect till the end,
                meaning you will always get healed for 72 HPs !<BR> <BR> <B>9.
				  Lifedraw: </B> Steal 40 hitpoints from target and give to self.&nbsp;<BR> <BR>
				  <B>10. Scent of Dusk:</B> Resistance Debuffer. If you notice that one certain
				  kind of monster keeps resisting your spells, cast this one at the beginning of
				  the battle. Everything should be much easier.<BR> <BR> <B>11. Sight Graft:</B>
				  The ability to see through your pet's eyes. Just two words : useless
				  spell.&nbsp;<BR> <BR> <B>12. Spook the Dead :</B> Causes an undead creature to
				  run away. It&acute;s Fear vs undead, since they quite oftenly resist Fear.<BR>
				  <BR> <B>13. Wave of Enfeeblement:</B> Removes strength from the creatures in
				  the area. (Also pets and party members in PvP servers). Just three words : damn useless spell. You
				  will probably end up reducing the critter&acute;s strenght, your pet&acute;s,
				  your whole party&acute;s and some other nasty monster walking by and therefore
				  having it aggroed on you too !! Keep away of this shit.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

			 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"> <B>1. Banshee Aura:</B> Adds a
				  damage shield to caster. Words needed : eratication and divination. Component
				  needed : Pearl (doesn&acute;t consume it after casting). Everytime a mob hits
				  you, the shielding hits it back for 10 Hp. Not a really useful spell since at
				  this lvl the monsters hit far too hard to handle it and you don&acute;t want
				  them close to you. Besides, with the <B><A
				  HREF="strategies.htm#1. Darkness-fear-DoT combo">Dearkness-Fear DoT
				  combo</A></B>, most of them won&acute;t even hit you once !!<BR> <BR> <B>2.
				  Cancel Magic:</B> Cancels the effect of a magic spell. Useful spell for two
				  reasons : If you want to remove a harassing spell cast on you, and in order to
				  de-buff your next prey<BR> <BR> <B>3. Cure Disease:</B> Cures the target of
				  disease. Great to cure yourself because Disease lasts ages to wear off by
				  itslef.&nbsp;<BR> <BR> <B>4. Feign Death:</B> Play dead to an enemy. Now, this
				  is the BEST SPELL IN GAME. Whenever a mob is hitting on you and you think<I>
				  that&acute;s it, this is the end,</I> cast this spell, you&acute;ll see how you
				  drop flat on the floor and the mob walks awat thinking it killed you !! But you
				  gotta cast this spell right after being hit by the critter (he&acute;ll think
				  that was a final blow), otherwise he won&acute;t get into trick and will keep
				  kicking you while on the floor. I&acute;m telling you, this spell has saved me
				  countless times. I honestly believe it as the best spell in game.<BR> <B><BR>
				  5. Heart Flutter: </B>Lowers target strength by 20, armour class by 9 and does
				  damage over time (150 HP in 72 secs). Lovely soloing spell toghether with&nbsp;
				  Endure Darkness and Heat bood. It gets resisted a bit more often that Heat
				  blood, but not as much as Darkness.<BR> <BR> <B>6. Hungry Earth: </B>Root spell
				  to undead creatures. Words needed : material and spirit. Keep an undead out of
				  movement, but still they can attack if you&acute;re withing mellee distance.
				  Drawback : random durability, sometime when you cast on him the root brakes
				  free. I&acute;d rather stick to spook the dead or fear spell.<BR> <B><BR> 7.
				  Infectious Cloud:</B> Disease area attack. Initiall area attack of 20, and then
				  deals 105 HP damage over the next 2 minutes. That&acute;s far too long time,
				  the fight should be finished much earlier. I don&acute;t like disease based
				  spells at all. Save your money.<BR> <BR> <B>8. Restless Bones: </B>Summons a
				  skeleton pet.Words needed: Reviviscence and sentient (azia), but can be
				  purchased at many vendors.&nbsp;More information at the <b><a href="Pet%20guide.htm">pet
                guide</a></b>.<BR> <BR> <B>9. Shielding: </B>Increases
				  maximum hitpoints by 50, armour class by 12 and magical resistance by 14. As
				  usual, need to get somebody to purchase it at the druids, wizzards or clerics
				  guild, but is a must have. Always have it cast on you.<BR> <BR> <B>10.
				  Shieldskin: </B> Protective Skin spell. Absorves the first 55 Hp of damage. It
				  burns a 3 golds worth <I>cats eye agate</I> (can be bought at any necro guild),
				  so it&acute;s a pretty expensive spell for common casting. Reserve it for any
				  speciall chance : a duel, a very tough monster, walking thru a
                KOS city, etc.<BR> <BR> <B>11. Spirit
				  Armour:</B> Adds 15 points to your armour class. Interesting spell since you
				  may cast it on you and on your pet too !! that&acute;s the real use of it. Many
				  levels above, I still use this spell.<BR> <BR> <B>12. Voice Graft: </B> Gives
				  you the ability to talk through your pet. Words needed : Word of the spoken and
				  Possession. Why the hell did Verant include this buffoonish spell on our list?
				  Ridiculous !!</FONT> </P><P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>13.
                Focus Death: </b>Purchaseable at Echo Caverns in Luclin. First
                of your pet buff spell line. This particulary one is about a 20%
                pet haste plus some STR boost. Doesn't last long though, about
                10 mins tops. Nevertheless, it is a nice spell because the
                higher damage out of your pet will save you mana via DoTs.&nbsp;</font> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

				  fight while your party colleagues mages and wizzies will remain

				  an undead creature as you pet for few minutes. When finished, the undead will
				  aggro on you like a maniac. Besides don&acute;t try it on any higher than blue
				  conning since it&acute;s got a high resistance rate. I dont really see

				  creature. Lovely spell when fighting undeads. Very mana efficient<BR> <BR>

				  Words needed : refuge and absortion. Amazing spell. Gives you some extra time
				  to run to zone, to yell for help, or also if you overtaunt the
                mob and hence he focuses on you in stead of your pet, HarmShield
                yourself and
				  he&acute;ll turn around back towards your pet again, giving
                you few more secs to cast <i>Fear</i>. A must have !! Drawback : Once
				  cast it, it takes 10 mins to be up to be recast.&nbsp;<BR> <BR> <B>6.
				  Identify: </B>Identify an item. Words needed : Enlightment and Anthology. Never
				  saw any item with hidden skills, so it&acute;s useless.<BR> <BR> <B>7. Shadow
				  Compact:</B> Transfer your health to another. I have ocasionally used this
				  spell in order to heal up my pet, or the groups tank if no
                cleric available.<BR> <BR>
				  <B>8. Shadow Vortex:</B> I &acute;ll be honest you: Never got this spell&nbsp;
				  :&nbsp; ) But I&acute;ve been told it ain&acute;t worthy.<BR> <BR> <B>9. Siphon
				  Life:</B> Remove 67 hitpoints from target and give to self. Still a must have,
				  but a bit dissapointing. In my opinion,&nbsp; it should be closer to 85 HP :
				  (<BR> <BR> <B>10. Track Copse:</B> Persistent Corpse Locator. I think this
				  spell is not yet available, but at any rate, locate corpse spell is rather
				  enough.<BR> <BR> <B>11. Word of Shadow :</B> Area effect radius 58 Hp damage.
				  Words needed : Cazic-thule and radiance. I don&acute;t like area damage spells.

				  rate though.&nbsp;High level necros still use this one on top

				  casting. I don&acute;t use in the middle of the combat but in order to reduce
				  downtimes.<BR> <BR> <B>7. Spirit Tap: </B> Removes hitpoints from target and
				  gives to self (exactly 140 HP). It&acute;s not a very mana eficiently. At this
				  level I&acute;d rather use vampiric curse for self healing purpouses and shock
				  of poison for more offensive ones.<BR> <B><BR> 8. Summon Dead:</B> Summons a
				  skeleton pet. Words needed : possession, haunting and rupturing. This is the
				  first pet able to duel wield, so give two one hand weapon and watch how he
				  kicks all the butts around. Can be purchased at any shadow knight guild.
