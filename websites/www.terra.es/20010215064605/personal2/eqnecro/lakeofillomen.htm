				Omen</U></B></FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Welcome to the new discovered land of
				Kunark !! where the wind swings the branches of the trees, where the high
				detailed monsters will take your breath away, and where a most horrible and
				desperating lag will drive you crazy!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">To get here you must take the boat
				from the docks at Oasis, then take a new boat (a weird one I&acute;d add) on
				Timorus Deep, then cross the Overthere zone, and then so do you in Frontier
				Mountains till eventually you get your tired ass to the wonderful area of Lake
				of ill Omen.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">First thing about Lake of Ill Omen :
				This is the place to boost up your levels from 20 to 25 in no time. Second
				thing to say : Since mobs here will con white or higher, you better know by
				heart how to use the <B><A
				HREF="strategies.htm#1. Darkness-fear-DoT combo">Darkness-Fear-DoT
				combo</A></B> or you&acute;ll die pretty quick. Third thing to say : Enjoy this
				zone, I love it.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok now, check the <B><A
				HREF="lakeofillomen_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map of Lake of Ill Omen</A></B>
				and go to the red cross. Bind yourself there and that very same point will be
				your pulling spot. The lake will be on your back and you&acute;ll be facing the
				hills, got it? Ok, all along the hill slope will most likely be roaming some
				mobs : goblings, tigers, iskar, surnak and skellies. They go from lvl 20 to 27.
				You have just arrived to this zone, so keep away from the red conning ones. But
				the rest are your potential preys. Have your pet to guard that inicial spot and
				you go off searching out for a monster. When you spot it, pull it with darkness
				towards your pet by the lakeside, where no other mob will disturb you. And know
				start teaching that impertinent creature what you&acute;r made of !! At this
				level they hit very hard, so don&acute;t let them get into mellee distance at
				any rate, but neither is a good idea to have your pet to deal with large
				amounts of damage because he won&acute;t last long. Remember, Darkness and Fear
				are your best life insurance.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If at some point you don&acute;t see
				any monster by the slope, adverture forth up to the top of the hill. There
				you&acute;ll see the haunted house (full up with nasty lvl 24 to 27 skellies)
				on the other part of the hill. It&acute;s marked on the <B><A
				HREF="lakeofillomen_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> with a black cross.
				But I&acute;m sure there won&acute;t be any need to get down there, since
				plenty of monsters are always at the top having a sun bathe. Always have your
				pet to guard the binding point by the Lakeside and pull the critters there, and
				you&acute;ll do just find.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Loot in this zone is no as good as it
				used to be in Highpass Hold <B>: ( </B>but the exp really makes it
				worthy.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Many players group up at the Surnak
				fortress gates exactly where the blue cross is placed on the <B><A
				HREF="lakeofillomen_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>. As a necro, you
				should need no group to hunt and level up (actually you should level up much
				quicker on your own), but if still you decide to hunt among some other players,
				get headed towards there and ask for a group. Still it can be good exp if the
				group is good and specially if they do non stop pulling. Otherwise, you better
				leave it.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Myself, I stuck to the red cross
				pulling spot (see <B><A HREF="lakeofillomen_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>) and I leveled up 5 levels in one week of average
				playing hours. Which is not bad if you consider that at theese levels, the
				leveling speed rate starts to seriously slow down comparing to what you have
				been used to for the last 8 levels.</FONT></P> </TD>
