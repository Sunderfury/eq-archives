			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Now, I can&acute;t really think of any
				other zone more adviceable than Oasis of Marr for lvl 12 to 16. I&acute;d even
				say that no adventurer on Norrath has made his way thru from lvl 12 up to 18
				without having hunted ever in Oasis. This zone is so good that you will love it
				and you&acute;ll hit lvl 16 within very few days.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Last level you were in Qeynos
				whereabouts, weren&acute;t you?. Ok then, to get here to Oasis will be kinda
				hard, because you&acute;ve got to cross Antonica. Of course, the best way to do
				so is to ask any guild mate for a TP (teleport spell) to West Commonland or to
				North or South dessert of Ro. Also, you can shout out for one and pay an
				average fee of 10 pp for it. But if you&acute;r broke or no one in Qeynos is
				able to satisfy your demands, you will have to do it by foot. This is the way :
				Qeynos-Qeynos Hills-West Karanas-North Karanas-East Karanas-High Pass
				Hold-Kithicor Forrest-West Commonlands-East Commonlands-North Ro-Oasis. As you
				can see is a looong walk, so try to get <I>SoW</I> or it&acute;ll take you
				ages. Also, be aware that you&acute;ll be KoS in many of those zones, so
				have<I> Gather Shadows</I> spell (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm">spells
				list</A></B> for more info) always on. In Kithicor forrest (specially at night)
				there are plenty of undead criatures, and therefore Gather Shadows won&acute;t
				be the solution but <I>Invisibility vs Undead</I> spell (check <B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm">spells list</A></B> for more info).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok, so eventually you have arrived to
				the lovely land of Oasis. Bind yourself at docks (Check the <B><A
				HREF="oasis_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map of Oasis</A></B>, I&acute;ve marked
				the docks down with a yellow cross) and get ready to rumble. Since you&acute;ve
				just gotten the powerful lvl 12 spells (check <B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm">spells list</A></B>), you are now up to use the <B><A
				HREF="strategies.htm#1. Darkness-fear-DoT combo">Darkness-Fear-DoT
				combo</A></B> when soloing.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The place to solo in Oasis is the
				Crocs highway (see <B><A HREF="oasis_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>)
				since plenty or crocs roam up and down the seaside. At lvl 12 and 13 go for
				caimans and crocodiles. At lvl 14 and 15 go for crocodiles and Deepwater
				caimans. At lvl 16 go for Deepwater caimans and the maighty Deepwater
				crocodiles. This DW crocodiles max their blows up to 42, so don&acute;t even
				try to mellee them or you&acute;ll be on the floor pretty quickly. The mayor
				bonus the Crocs highway&acute;s got is that crocs are not aggro on you, even
				while fighting another croc. This means you can confidently pull one croc and
				be possitively sure that non of its colleagues will join up against you. So you
				can take them 1 by 1.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Whenever you need to med up, climb any
				of the 2 pillars on the beach ( marked on the <B><A
				HREF="oasis_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> with green crosses) because
				from time to time some moron pull a sand giant or a spectre to the seaside,
				slaughtering off any absent-minded newbie in their way ( they hit for almost
				100 !! ). Believe me, I have seen spectres gotten loose along the beach and
				slicing off several newbies in less than 1 minute !! Now, that was fun to
				watch.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The other mayor hunting place in Oasis
				is the Orc highway. This place is meant to be camped by full groups
				&acute;cause everytime you pull an orc, another one or two might easily come
				along too. Anyway, if you want to try to solo at the Orc highway, place your
				pulling spot at the blue cross I&acute;ve marked on the <B><A
				HREF="oasis_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>. Pull your preys up there at
				the top of the zone limit hill and deal with the orc safely there. Go for the
				An orc warriors, but keep away from the Orc Priests (due to their damn
				self-healing up skills) and the A orc warrior (please note that theese ones are
				&acute;<I>A</I>&acute; orc warriors and not &acute;<I>An&acute;</I> orc
				warriors. The <I>A</I> orc warriors are lvl 20 or higher and hit far too hard
				for you at this level).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If in stead of soloing orcs,
				you&acute;d rather preffer to hunt them in a group, go to the spot with a
				purple cross on the <B><A HREF="oasis_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>.
				There is where most of groups pull their preys. Ask them to let you in or just
				shout out to start a new orc group. In Oasis there are always loads of
				candidates, you&acute;ll see, and it&acute;s very easy to create new groups in
				few minutes.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In spite of the fact that hunting orcs
				in groups is much safer and you will not die half as often as you&acute;d do
				soloing crocs, I would advice you to choose the crocs. Why? well, two reassons
				: First, if you do your job propperly and don&acute;t die every second combat,
				exp will fly upwards. That I can promise you. Second, this is your first chance
				to practise the Darkness-Fear-DoT combo (check <B><A
				HREF="strategies.htm">hunting strategies</A></B>) and that&acute;s very
				important since from now on that strategy will be your main fighting weapon,
				and it&acute;s very important you learn it quickly. I know that crocs&acute;s
				loot sucks, but still I think that they are what you should be hunting
				down.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">At the gypsy camp you can always sell
				or buy stuff (including food and water), so you don&acute;t need to go to any
				other zone in order to do so.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The only problem I would consider
				about hunting in Oasis are, as I said before, the wandering high level spectres
				and sand giants. But don&acute;t worry to much, people shout it when any of
				those are out of control heading either the orc or the crocs highway. Also, you
				can avoid being caught by any of them while medding up if you do it up the
				pillars by the beach, as I explained above. Also watch out for the Dry Bone
				Skelletons, lvl 20 to 22 very nasty ideed skellie casters.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">You will love this zone, and the jump
				from lvl 12 up to 16 will be even faster than the one from 7 to 12, I&acute;m
				100% sure about that.</FONT></P> </TD>
