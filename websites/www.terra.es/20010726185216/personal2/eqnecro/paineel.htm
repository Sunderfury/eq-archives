			 <P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial" color="#0066FF"><B><U>Paineel</U></B></FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">I have assumed that you have taken my
				advice as good and have made a necro erudite. That means you will start is
				paineel, in the western continent of Odus. Paineel is not a very exciting area,
				but it&acute;s got, in my opinion, the best newbie area all arround :
				It&acute;s small, not crowded at all (Freeport&acute;s or Qeynos&acute;s are
				much busier), guards are always close in case you need to run up to them for
				help and it&acute;s plenty of low level monsters like decaying skelletons,
				bats, rats, snakes and the toughest of the loot, fire beattles.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The first step will buy your level 1
				spells (check the <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm">spells list</A></B> section).
				Since you start with no money at all (stingy Verant&acute;s staff), I&acute;d
				feel no shame to beg any higher level guy to spare some golds. Level 1 spells
				cost 1 gold each, so just ask for couple of golds to each player. Don&acute;t
				be greedy, since high level players get several incoming tells from newbies
				begging for money. Just ask few golds, and you&acute;ll probably get
				them.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Once you&acute;ve gotten the money,
				its time to go to the necromancers&acute;s guild inside the fortress. Have a
				look to the <I><B><A HREF="paineel_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">Paineel
				map</A></B></I> to find your way to the necromancers&acute;s guild. But before
				that, you&acute;ve got to tell the guard in the newbie hunting ground
				&acute;<I>need keyz&acute;</I>. He&acute;ll give you the key that is needed to
				operate the elevator (see map). To do so, just stand by a big rock in front of
				the lift, and with the key as a pointer, point the rock and press
				&acute;U&acute; button in your keyboard. I know its kinda weird, but
				that&acute;s the way it is. Same system when you have bought your spells and
				want to get back upstairs.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok, time&acute;s up !! Time to prove
				yourself and teh whole world why necromancers rock !! Get to the newbie area
				and again beg anybody to either give you a couple of bones chips or to kill a
				decaying skelleton to loot them off the corpse. Now cast your first skellie pet
				ever and med up mana till full. And that&acute;s it, begin the slaughter. The
				solo hunting startegy you&acute;ll use is the lifetap mellee fighting (check
				<B><A HREF="strategies.htm">strategies</A></B> section for more
				info).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Do no walk far away from the guards,
				because if you see that the critter is winning the battle, you always can run
				up to the guard and he&acute;ll kill it for you. At level 1 kill bats (they are
				the easiet ones) and keep all the loot you get bacuse it can be sold for few
				coppers or silvers to the vendors inside the fortress. At lvl 2 and 3 kill
				decaying skelletons, especialy those ones carrying weapons. Give the first
				weapon you get to you pet (it will increase his attacking power) and sell the
				rest to vendors (you&acute;ll get golds for each weapon !!, and that at this
				level is big money man). Also, try to store in your inventory as many bone
				chips stacks as you can because you need them to cast your pet up. If you see
				any high level necromancer offer them to him, being the average price per stack
				2 platinium coins !!! At level 4 hunt fire beattles because its risky for you
				to try to take them down before. Also sell all the fire beattle&acute;s eyes
				you get.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If you haven&acute;t had any major
				problem, which you shouldn&acute;t have had, you&acute;ll reach level 4 within
				couple of hours maybe, and then you are ready to buy the next circle spells
				(check the <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm">spells list</A></B> section) and move
				one to the next area !!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The only problem you may find in this
				otherwise very safe newbie area is <I>Neclo&acute;s pet, </I>a level 5
				skelleton who wanders arround the newbie area. He spawns every 20 mins or so.
				If you can, when you get lvl 4 and once you have bought your brand new spells,
				try to kill him. The loot is a bone you are due to give to the NPC shadow
				knight called <B><I>Neclo</I></B>, who also stands in that very same newbie
				area. He&acute;ll give you back a very nice bone staff which I think is quite
				an item for your level. Congratulations, you&acute;ve completed your first
				quest !!</FONT></P> </TD>
