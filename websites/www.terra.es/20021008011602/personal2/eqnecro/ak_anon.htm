			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ak&acute;Anon is the gnomes&acute;s
				underground home town. It&acute;s a place full up with plenty of mechanical and
				steamy devices all over.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">There&acute;s a spawn here that will
				be most suitable for your level. I did it myself and leveled up reasonably safe
				from lvl 25 to 29 in few days. Besides, the loot is excellent (up to 3 pp in
				cash plus ocasionally some few plats worth pieces of armour and fine steel
				weapons. And, rarely, some expensive jewels and even black pearls
				!!).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Now, your goal is the mechanic&acute;s
				spawn. He is a lvl 26 to 28 gnome and takes exactly 6 minutes to spawn up. As
				you have noticed, this place is a dungeaon-alike zone, so not very good idea to
				Fear the creatures arround. Therefore, you&acute;ll have to use the <B><A
				HREF="strategies.htm#3. Lifetap series mellee fighting :">Lifetap-Mellee-combo</A></B>
				to solo this mech. Yes, I know, don&acute;t faint down to floor yet. I know
				you&acute;r are not supossed to use this combo because the mobs at theese
				levels hit just too hard, but trust uncle Necro (that's me) : this mech
				is weaker than a pneumatic gay !! Max up his blows at 32 !! That&acute;s
				nothing, critters 8 levels ago used to hit harder, so don&acute;t tell me you
				can&acute;t kick this butt. But, of course, have your shielding spells always
				up ( just in case, you know).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Bind yourself at the blue cross (check
				<B><A HREF="ak_anon_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>). That will be also
				your pulling spot. The mech spawns at the red cross (<B><A
				HREF="ak_anon_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>), just next by a vendor,
				whom you can sell your stuff to. Don&acute;t missclick and attack the vendor,
				because it wouldn&acute;t be healthy<B> : )</B>. So, remember? : Darkness, send
				pet, few secs, Heat Blood, few secs, Shock of Poison, get hit, lifetap, get
				hit, lifetap, you gain experience. Piece of cake, ain&acute;t it?</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The only problem is that when the mech
				is about to die, he jumps into the water diving towards a clockwork (spidery
				guards) posted 300 feet away. Don&acute;t let the mech go!! As soon as he jumps
				into the water, jump too after him and kill him with Shock of Poison as quickly
				as you can, otherwise the guard will kill you. In orden to cast underwater, you
				must stand still, not moving at all or the casting will be
				interrupted.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Once you have killed him, you&acute;ve
				got 6 minutes before it respawns. which is time enough to recover mana and HP
				back.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">There&acute;re few more mech spawns
				throughtout the zone, but the only one suitable for tall erudites like you (you
				cannot cast away while ducking in any of the low silling Ak&acute;Anon
				passages) is inside the castle (marked on the <B><A HREF="ak_anon_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> with the number 13), where King Ak&acute;Anon holds
				his crown. Is the one in a closed tiny just-one-entrance room. But I think the
				one we where talking about before is better.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Eventually, and because you&acute;ve
				been a naughty fellow, the guards and any other Ak&acute;Anon citizen will
				glare at you threateningly, what will make Gather Shadows become your best
				friend. But still the vendor would buy stuff from you for a longer
				period.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">This zone is not heavily camped at
				all. Actually, the average number of players is always bellow 10. Still, you
				may be unlucky and find the mech camped. Then you&acute;ll have to risk it and
				look for the other mech spawn inside the castle (sorry it&acute;s not detailed
				on the map the inner rooms of the castle). But I believe you&acute;ll be able
				to camp it peacefully.</FONT></P> </TD>
