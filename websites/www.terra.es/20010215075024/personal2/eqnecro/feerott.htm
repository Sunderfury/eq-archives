			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The Feerott is the wet, smelly and
				sticky swamp the ogres use as their newbie zone. And you could now reply me
				back : A newbie zone as a hunting place for a lvl 30+ necro? Yeppers !! Because
				within this zone is the entrance to the Plane of Fear. Now, don&acute;t shit
				your pants yet, we are not going to any Plane of Fear, I said only the
				entrance.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The entrance to such a plane is a
				hidding fake wall where the red cross lies on the <B><A HREF="feerott_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>. Inside that cave there are few spectres (lvl 33 to
				37 very spooky looking undead creature). Do not pull any of those, even if you
				see only one standing there, because I promisse you, there are many more around
				the corner and you WILL pull them all along !!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">So what then? aha ! now is when you
				realize how brilliant this necro guide is <B>: )</B> Check the <B><A
				HREF="feerott_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> once more. Within that
				reddish rectangular area I have marked out on it, there is a hill, and
				somewhere on that hill there is a tree, and sitting down by that tree
				there&acute;s a... lonely spectre !! Looks awfully scary, doesn&acute;t it? But
				hey, don&acute;t be a wimp. You can easily take it down</FONT>.</P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">There are four very good thing about
				hunting specs: </FONT></P> 
			 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>1.</B>Awesome exp when
				  soloing.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>2.</B>They have a low Magic
				  Resistance and </FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>3.</B>You can outrun them without
				  SoW. </FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>4. </B>It&acute;s a very fast 6
				  minutes re-spawn, which is just time enough to med mana to full with allure of
				  Death.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Now, how do you hunt them? First of
				all, memorice panic the dead in stead of the beloved Fear. And now same stuff
				as usual: <B><A HREF="strategies.htm#1. Darkness-fear-DoT combo">Darkness-Panic
				the dead-DoT</A></B> combo. You have heard about this before, haven&acute;t
				you?<B> : ) </B>Anyhow, do not let them get any close too you, &acute;cause the
				hit for 92 !! They cast minor lifetap spells and Fear too, but you&acute;ll
				resist it most of the times.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">What about the loot ? Up to 6 pp cash,
				rusty scythes and sometimes <I>a scythe</I> (worth 11 pp at vendors). Not too
				bad.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Actually, hunting spectres are much
				easier than it would initially seem due to their low magic resistance and to
				that crappy lvl 12 drain life spell of theirs. Psa ! nothing like a good necro
				!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Only drawback is that is not easy to
				find this spot uncamped. Probably you&acute;ll have to get into a waiting list
				if it&acute;s not available, but at higher levels that&acute;s every single
				day&acute;s business. But I think is worthy, honestly. At these levels, specs
				are the best exp creature you can solo.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Also, I must warn you about a nasty
				NPC who roams all over the zone : Roror and his pet. He&acute;s a high
				40&acute;s shamman lizzard and he&acute;s very very aggro on you. Many times,
				while camping this otherwise safe spec spawn, Roror would sneak on my back and
				hit me for over 100&acute;s, killing me and my pet within seconds.
				There&acute;s no real chance to escape away if you ever run into him,
				&acute;cause he&acute;ll hit you so hard and so fast that not ever feing death
				will safe you. Just pray your God to keep you out of his way and Gate the fuck
				out if you spot him at once. There are another dangerous NPCs like Ogre guards,
				but they post still in certain places, so not really big deal.</FONT></P> </TD>
