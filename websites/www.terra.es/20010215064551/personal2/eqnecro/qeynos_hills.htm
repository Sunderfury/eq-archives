			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In this zone you will certanly level
				up from level 4 to 7 very quickly, but first you&acute;ve got to get
				there.</FONT> </P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">First take the boat at Erudin&acute;s
				docks. This, after crossing Erud&acute;s crossing, will eventually take you to
				South Qeynos. When you get off the boat, don&acute;t move from the docks
				because you are KoS in Qeynos, and either a guard or a NPC will definatelly
				kill you. What you&acute;ve got to do is to shout at docks to any kind caster
				to bind you there (so if you die, you won&acute;t have to make the trip all way
				back again) and then to cast invisibility spell on you. Once, done this, go to
				North Qeynos (see <B><A HREF="qeynos.gif" TARGET="_blank">South Qeynos and
				North Qeynos map</A></B>) and the head for the northern gate. Once there, walk
				away the main path and again ask for a bind, otherwise if you die you&acute;ll
				must shout arround for invisivility again.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Now just follow the path (but from the
				distance, don&acute;t walk it along due to the patrolling guards) and there you
				are, welcome to Qeynos Hills.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Once in Qeynos Hills, you&acute;ll
				face again the same problem than in Qeynos town, the hostile patrolling guards.
				In the <B><A HREF="qeynos_hills_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">Qeynos Hills
				map</A></B>, you&acute;ll see a squared area by Black Burrow entrance. Well,
				that&acute;s your destination. It&acute;s a long walk thru the hills, so try to
				avoid any guard (use a wide angle view for better guard-spotting) or any other
				creatures like wolves or bears. Once you get to BB (black burrow) entrance,
				walk arround and you&acute;ll see some gnolls. Those gnolls go from lvl 5 to 7,
				so leveling up here will be a piece of cake. Besides, some of them carry rusty
				weapons and a fairly good loot. Ashame that you can&acute;t sell the weapons to
				any vendor since you are very KoS indeed in the whereabouts : ( . Well, keep
				few of them in order to have a well armed pet.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Another extra value for this area is
				that killing gnolls will increse you faction standing with Qeynos citizens, and
				eventually you might not being KoS anylonger, but don&acute;t get to exited yet
				since the number of gnolls you are to kills in huge !!&nbsp; Most likely you
				won&acute;t kill so many during theese levels, but step by step one day you may
				even be warmly welcome in the Goddamn Qeynos ( I hate that city man!!
				)</FONT></P> </TD>
