				boiling area of the Lavastorm Mountains.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Solusek&acute;s Eye (also known as Sol
				A, being Sol B Nagafen&acute;s Lair) is a very messy and twisted dungeon. Fire
				goblins are its inhabitants, along with a bunch of miner gnomes.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">This is a tipical group-orientated
				zone. And not only that, but YOUR-group-orientated zone, meaning that you
				should bring your own group here (gather up some friends or guild mates). Why?
				Because this dungeon is not very popular, so there won&acute;t be many groups
				out there. Second, since you can get lovely items camping some easy mobs, the
				groups won&acute;t be really willing to take a new member in, cutting down
				their own chances to win a lotto for any item they are after. So, listen to me,
				bring here you&acute;r own full group and get ready for this interesting and
				lucrative zone</FONT>.</P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok, take a look on the <B><A
				HREF="solusek_eye_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>. You will see a red
				squared area and a few blue ones. At lvl 25, your group could not be ready yet
				to go to camp the nice items dropper lvl 30 guys spawning in the blue squared
				areas. So I&acute;d advice you to hit first lvl 29 at the red squared room, and
				fast pulling fire goblings from any of your surroundings. This way, if your
				group does a good job, those three levels will fly away very quickly (few
				days).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Once you&acute;ve gotten into lvl 29,
				and before leaving this zone, spend couple of days trying to get any of the
				items dropped in the blue squared areas (<B><A HREF="solusek_eye_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>). The critters that drop them are in their high
				20&acute;s or even 30, but with a group of lvl 29 members like yours, that
				shouldn&acute;t be any problem at all. Most of the spawns take 20 minutes since
				last death, so you won&acute;t be really looking for exp here but for the
				items. Once you get any of them, check its selling price at <B><A
				HREF="http://www.maximumeq.com" TARGET="_blank">www.maximumeq.com</A></B>. They
				update every item&acute;s average price quite oftenly.</FONT></P> </TD>
