			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Now, to get to this zone is a bit
				tricky because you&acute;ve got to discover out a secret entrance in the outer
				walls of North Qeynos. Ok, imagine you have just step out the city thru the
				gate. Turn on your right and follow the wall till it turns the corner. Once you
				have done so, you&acute;ll see a portion of the wall covered up with moss.
				That&acute;s the fake wall, so just walk thru and dive into the
				well.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Once you have zoned in Qeynos sewers
				zone, follow the arrow I have drawn in red on the <B><A
				HREF="qeynos_sewers_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map of the
				zone</A></B>.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok, so now you are in the
				thugs&acute;s room. As you can see, they spawn in couples. That&acute;s the
				problem, at level 7 you cannot take both of them. In stead of that,
				you&acute;ll have to ask a high level guy in the zone (hunting smugglers or
				sharks) to brake the spawn for you, meaning to kill one of them and let the
				other alive for a couple or minutes more. Doing this you have achieved that
				they&acute;ll spawn separately, so you can kill one, med mana up, and be ready
				when the second thug spawns up.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><font size="2" face="Arial">This guys will hit considerably harder than the
				gnolls or kobolds you were fighting last level. So, how can I take them down?
				Piece of cake : have your pet posted in the corridor and once the spawn is
				broken, pull the single thug out of the room. This is just in case the second
				one spawns up whilst still fighting the first one. If you were fighting inside
				the room, the just spawned thug would join his mate and tear you apart, but if
				you are in the corridor, he won&acute;t see you and therefore he will stay
				still picking his nose and humming silly balads. Got it?</font></P> 
			 <P><font size="2" face="Arial">At level 8 go to the necromancers&acute;s guild and
				purchanse the lvl 8 spells (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm">spells
				list</A></B> section to find out which ones are worthy to buy), but
				unfortunately there are not many attack spells in this spells circle, so
				I&acute;m afraid you&acute;ll have to stick to the <B><A
				HREF="strategies.htm#3. Lifetap series mellee fighting :">lifetap-mellee
				fighting strategy</A></B>.</font></P> 
			 <P><font size="2" face="Arial">The thugs give very good experience, so stick to
				them till you reach level 9. and then head to the smuggler rooms (check <B><A
				HREF="qeynos_sewers_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B> again). Now, do
				exactly the same that what you were doing in the thug room : call assistance to
				brake spawn, pull the smuggler out of the room, lifetap-mellee strategy,
				etc.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">The smugglers are lvl 9 to 12 so they can hit over
				20&acute;s, not to mention their boss, the <I>Ring leader, </I>who is lvl 14
				and hits very very hard indeed. She spawns randomly from time to time, but
				whenever she does, do not mess with her. Just beg any higher level fellow
				within the zone to kill her for you. Also, <i>Verant</i> has
             recently inclued in the spawning table a level 40ish female named
             smugler who hits for 120s. If she spawns, just forget about it.
             Move to the another smugler room or call for assistance to high
             level guildmates.</font></P> 
			 <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Hunting smugglers will push you up to lvl 12 very
				quickly. Just buy the spells in the guild and pack up your belongings
				&acute;cause we&acute;ll be on the road towards the eastern part of the
				continent. A long travel&acute;s ahead mate </font><font face="Arial" size="3"><b> : )</b></font></P> 
			 <P><font size="2" face="Arial">The only withdraw I could find worth to point out
				in this zone is that there are very few rooms where to hunt in, so they could
				be camped when you arrive there. In case they are, ask the guy whether
				he&acute;s going to be arround there for long time. If he is, ask him to group
				up(better half exp than none at all !! ) and if he doesn&acute;t want to, go to
				<B><A HREF="blackburrow.htm">BlackBurrow</A></B>, which is just two zones away.
				If you are lucky and when you arrive to the sewers, the room you are interested
				about is available, do no leave it at any rate. Spawns are precious goods in
				EverQuest </font> <B><font face="Arial" size="3">: )</font></B></P> 
             <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
			 <P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip</b> : If for any reasson you see that things
				are getting too tough and you think that you are gonna kick the backet, run
				like a mad to the blue cross I&acute;ve marked down on the <B><A
				HREF="qeynos_sewers_map.htm" TARGET="_blank">map</A></B>. There&acute;s a small
				cliff there leading to another room on the lower floor. So if the thug or the smuggler is on you
				kicking your back, just jump off. You&acute;ll get hit for about 5 HP, but
				you&acute;ll get rid of him since he&acute;s got to make all the way arround
				down the ramp in order to get to that very room. They do that because of a path
				finding bug, but I&acute;d rather say they are too wimps to jump !!. Anyway,
				doing this you&acute;ll have more less 10 seconds to quickly cast
             <i> Gate</i> spell and pop up
				safely in your binding spot.</font></P>
