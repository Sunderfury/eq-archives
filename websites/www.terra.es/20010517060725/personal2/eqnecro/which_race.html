			 <P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If you visit any
				which-race-should-I-go-for? forum around, you&acute;ll notice that
				there&acute;s no general agreement about which race is the best over the rest.
				Some people say erudites are the best due to their <b> high
             intelligence</b>. Some
				would say dark elves are the top of the rank because of their <b> high
             agility</b> and their <b> natural ultravision</b> and <b>hiding
             skills</b>. Some others would go for the gnome, since
				they&acute;ve got a <b> good overall starting points</b> and
             they look so cute&nbsp; </FONT><b><font color="#FF8000" face="Arial" size="3">:
             )</font></b><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"> . Even humans&acute;ve got
				their own supporters even though <b>they are crap necros</b>
             hehe. As I said before, no
				race stands on top of the rest (well, apart from humans).</FONT></P> 
             <P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">But since this is my
				page, I&acute;ll feel free to give you my choice: <b> go for the
             erudite</b>!! Why?
				Well, because they start with a <b> maxed intelligence of 142</b> (if you distribute
				as many points as you can to raise up intelligence) and that&acute;s exactly
				what you want, believe me. If you do so, you will have 5 remaining points left.
				You could use them to <b> raise either agility</b> (to avoid getting hit)
             <b> or strength</b>
				(in order to be able to carry more weight on you). I&acute;d put them to
             agility, because at low levels you have to melee, and some dodging
             wont hurt.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000" SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">But now, why is so
				important to have a high base intelligence? Well, more intelligence means
             <b> more
				mana</b> (till you reach 200, when any farther intelligence will hardly increase
				mana a bit), and more mana means that you can cast more spells in a row.
				Intelligence is crucial for casters since our power&acute;s based on our
				spells. Now, you can increase intelligence with magical int-bonus items, which
				some of them are not cheap or easy to get at all. <b> Your aim is to max
				intelligence up to 200</b>, and therefore you&acute;ll have to shop around trying
				to acquire plenty of these items. Some people say its easy to get the money to
				buy all those items, so you can have an impressive equipment fairly quickly.
				Lets say you choose to be a dark elf, or even a human. Even if you spend most
				of your starting points to intelligence, still it&acute;ll stand bellow 120, so
				you&acute;ve got to buy a bunch of these magical artefacts. In order to get an
				over-80-intelligence-bonus-items you may easily be looking for over 20000
				platinum coins, and that is no easy task to achieve. Its true that when you
				are in your forties (lvl 40+), then you will be earning money much much faster,
				but before that your intelligence&acute;ll be too low and won&acute;t be able
				to cast many spells without having to keep medding up often. I&acute;m
				telling you, get yourself an erudite, max up your intelligence, and don&acute;t
				worry about having to save up all your earning cause of the damn expensive
				intelligence bonus items. And whenever the hell you become rich, then
				you&acute;ll be able to spend your money in whatever items you fancy, not only
				intelligence bonus items because you will have already reached 200 !!</FONT></P>
             <P><font color="#FF8000" size="2" face="Arial">I have adviced you
             to chose and erudite because being my own race, is the one I know
             the best. But it is also fair to say that there is another race
             which is as powerful as the erudite when it comes to follow the
             dark path of the necromantic arts : the <b>iksar</b>. The iksar has
             got its own characteristics that makes them worlds apart from the
             'old' races (erudite, human, gnome and dark elf). First of all they
             got <b>natural faster health regeneration</b> which, of course,
             increses level by level. The regeneration is specially important to
             necro in order to <b>offset the <i>Lich</i> series</b> (HP to mana
             transfer, check <b><a href="spell_list.html">spell list</a></b> if
             needed). This means that, while liching up, you wont lose as many
             HP as you would with any other race, hence having to lifetap less
             often, hence <b>saving up mana</b>, hence <b>cutting down medding
             downtimes</b>. The result is quite outstanding, I tested it myself
             with a high lvl necro iksar friend of mine: he would lose less than
             half the HP I would while having lich up !! That is a lot.</font></P>
             <P><font color="#FF8000" size="2" face="Arial">In the other hand,
             Iksars have got very <b>awful starting base stats</b> (max base int
             is 110 whereas erudites is 142 !!). The problem having such a low
             starting int is that either you <b>waste lots of inventory slots
             towards int bonus items</b> (in order to reach the 200 int cap) or
             else you will definitely have a <b>shorter mana pool</b>. This is
             not, in my opinion, something so horrible : we necros once we get
             at lvl 34 Call of Bones, and specially at 49 with Lich, we regen
             mana fast as hell, so probably you shouldnt be OOM oftenly. That
             being said, never forget that to have an extra mana bubble is
             always a lifesaver indeed. </font></P>
             <P><font color="#FF8000" size="2" face="Arial">Also, iksars have
             got high agility, so <b>their AC is better than erudites</b>.That
             might help a lot when a mob is taking you for a beat and you are
             trying to cast <i>Gate</i> spell off.</font></P>
             <P><font color="#FF8000" size="2" face="Arial">Top that off with
             the fact that Iksar race has got a <b>20% exp penalty</b>. Yes
             that's right, it's like the exp bar had 6 bubbles instead of 5.
             Some guys say that since they regen HP faster, and since they don't
             burn so much mana via lifetaps, their shorter downtimes make it up
             for the exp penalty. My opinion is that pre 50 that might be
             possible, but it won't post 50, where every single God damned level
             is hell level (you nice twice exp to level up). Adding that up,
             remember that post 50 you don't solo anymore and downtimes will
             deppend on the whole party's need and not just your own. And, as I
             said in the <b><a href="Level%2050%20to%2060.htm">where to hunt
             section -lvl 50 to 60-</a></b> , your way thru the 50s will take
             most likely longer that from lvl 1 to 50. Believe me, <b>you don't
             want an exp penalty post 50</b>.</font></P>

             <p><font color="#FF8000" size="2" face="Arial">In my opinion, and
             since EQ is a long term game (read long way from 1 to 60), <b>I
             would still chose an erudite on top of the iksar</b>. Why? Mainly
             because, as I said, the exp penalty will indeed be a pain post 50
             and the HP regen wont make it up I'm afraid. If EQ was only 1 to
             50, I would go lizzard, but since post 50 levels are so tough...
             Also, to equip an erudite is much cheaper, more rewarding and wider
             in possibilities. At the end of the day, Iksars have always to keep
             a rather high amount of int bonus items, and that leaves them with
             less real chances to wear weird and exotic items with weird and
             exotic stats/effects. </font></p>
             <p><font color="#FF8000" size="2" face="Arial">If the necro is your
             second char, and you have a rich and high level main character who
             will generously twink the new iksar necro, then you might decide to
             go for the iksar. But, overall, I still believe that the <b>erudite
             makes the best necromancer</b> out there.</font></p>
