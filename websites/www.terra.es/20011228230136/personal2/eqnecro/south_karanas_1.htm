			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In SK (South Karanas) inhabits one of
				the most dessirable and hunted creature for players in their 20&acute;s : the
				treants (lvl 24 to 28 tree form druid). Three of them spawn on the upper-right
				corner of the <B><B><A HREF="south_karanas_map.htm"
				TARGET="_blank">map</A></B></B>, marked down by a green squared
				area.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">This place is heavily camped, and
				besides they are probably too strong for you at your earlies 20&acute;s to solo
				them. So I&acute;m afraid you gotta beg for a group here. But, once you get
				into one, you&acute;ll see how the exp bar will be non-stop moving forwards. It
				is indeed that good exp. And so is the loot !</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The treant itself is a nasty fellow :
				casts DDs, powerful DoTs and hit hard in mellee combat. But thanks God they
				only have 650 HP, so if you&acute;r in a group with few casters, the tree will
				get chopped down to floor within seconds.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">There&acute;s nothing much else to
				say. It&acute;s an easy prey if the group is formed by 3 or 4 guys, and the
				spawn is reasonably fast, so as I said the exp is awesome.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Only 1 main drawback : It&acute;s
				always camped, and therefore not easy to have your group coming along to hunt
				them. Only chance is to snake into any group, and that&acute;s no easy task
				since players keep this small treasure tight for themselves !!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Oh, one last thing: The faction hits
				are awfully bad, but since we are necros and since we&acute;re already KoS to
				most druids, who the fuck cares !! Kill them all !! Blast those tree-huggers
				away !! I love being mean, don&acute;t you?<B> : )</B></FONT></P> </TD>
