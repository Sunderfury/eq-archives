<P>For those not in the know, the spdat.eff file contains all the information regarding the various spells, songs and effects of Everquest. First to address the obvious question, "Can you alter the SPDAT file to make spells different?". Well I do not know, I doubt that VI would make it that easy to alter spell effects, but several peices of information can be found from looking within the hex code of the SPDAT file.
<P>Now VI in the past has posted fake data to the file so any information found here is all speculative.
<P>Well on with the changes.
<P>
<P>Once VI stops doing the Patch of the Day I will post a finally alteration form pre-Luclin to post-Luclin.
