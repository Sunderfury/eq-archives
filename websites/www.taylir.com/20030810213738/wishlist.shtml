<TITLT>My VI wish list</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
Since I have been playing EQ since May 99 I think I know this game pretty well. So I have decided to post this wish list in hopes that someone from VI will take notice to it. In no particular order...
<UL>
<LI>Int caster and monk Kunark click armor. Int casters and monks really got left out with Kunark, no special tradable click armor at all. But when the Beastlords hit the game they got new click armor in Kunark, so let's toss the int casters and monks a bone.
<LI><STRIKE>Get the /bazaar command working. If you have time to develop a $40 a month server with a special zone not included on the other servers and interactive guild databases on the Stormhammer, you surely can devote a little time to what you promised with the release of Luclin. I mean you have not lived up to the total expectations of the Luclin description and some could see that as a form of deceptive advertising.</STRIKE>
<LI>More info with the /charinfo command. Let's get off this "not telling how much mana the casters have" high horse. Make /charinfo so your max mana amount. It is so easy for a character to know which is better a +STA or +HP item, just watch the amount of hitpoints change. But when it comes to mana, it is really a crap shoot as to which is better a +INT/WIS or +MANA. Most people know the formula for below lvl 50 and 200 points of INT/WIS, but above that is still kind of a mystery. Let's eliminate that shall we.
<LI><STRIKE>Jewelcraft revamp. While still one of the most useful of tradeskills, it is probably long overdue for a revamp. The jewelry kit has 4 slots, let's use them.</STRIKE> Make JC to when you could put a mold in there to shift what kind of jewelcraft item is being made. I mean JC would be much more versatile in this manner and in greater demand. If you shift an item off of its normal inventory slot add a degree of difficulty to the attempt. Or even make it to where you could use 2 different gems to make a multifunctional piece of jewelry or a different JC item all together.
<LI>Make the Katta tinkering components stackable. This is the only viable bridge in tinkering to 215 but the hassle is it is located in Katta; kind of isolated and not very kind to us gnome gnecromancers plus it isn't even stackable. Let's make is stackable like you did the pelts, sheets of metal etc...
<LI><STRIKE>Put the languages to some use other than books. It would be so cool since I am a master at Elder Dragon, to go up to Yelniak and hail him in ED and have him reply in ED "Ah, a little one who knows the old tongue" and give me a quest or something.</STRIKE>
<LI>Put Identify to use. It now tells the Lore name that each item has which can be separate from the name displayed on a right-click, but how about having it also tell when the item procs and if it has a variable effect like Haste or damage how much it does. If it is a summoning focus, state what levels of pets it affects. Would this really upset game balance?
<LI>Enforce the naming convention. With Stormhammer characters being able to have there name passed on to the other servers, I sure do not want to see Smackdaddie's Hammer appear on a server. I would probably spew all over my keyboard. But lets not get heavy handed on Stormahmmer either, I have seen many violations of the naming convention that should be addressed as well.
<LI>Make a Questor position. This would be a person, similar to a guide, but who is responsible for developing and running quests. Since Stormhammer is probably going to keep the paid employees tied up to keep those customers happy, let players develop their own quests. Create a submission and approval process for the quests and rewards and start recruiting players to run these events. I mean the name of the game is Ever<B>QUEST</B>.
<LI><STRIKE>Show more vendor inventory. An interesting thing developed by tradeskill workers is vendor mining. It is costly but sometimes the easiest way to find the items you need. Can we increase the vendor's displayable inventory to be everything they are able to sell?</STRIKE>
<LI>Remove all positive faction increases from killing vendors. I am so tired of trying to do tradeskill stuff in Thurgadin and having all the merchants and bankers being pulled while trying to use them. If they do not leave a corpse when killed, remove any positive benefit you may get from factions.
<LI>Make the final epic turn in on a plane. I was really disgusted to see a lvl 20 Shaman in Paludal Caverns whinning about not being able to click on his epic. Or, at a minimum, put a rec level of 46 on it. Magician epic is quite perfect, have to be 46 to cast the spell anyway.
</OL>
There will probably be more as I think about them, but this is it for now.
<P>
Well not sure if I am being heard or if these were just normal game developements, but am using the <STRIKE>STRIKE</STRIKE> markup to show what has been changed to my liking, though some of them were just partially applied.
