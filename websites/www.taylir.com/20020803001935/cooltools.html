Here are some neat tools and such for EQ and just everyday life
<P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.eqcaster.com" TARGET=_BLANK>EQ Caster</A> - The best spell parser I have found that is easy to use. I use this in conjunction with a hex editor to maintain my <A HREF="./spdatch.shtml">SDPATE Changes Page</A>.
<P><A HREF="http://www.gralin.com/everlogs/Default.htm" TARGET=_BLANK>Everlogs</A> - A log file parsing program that traks the information in your EQ Log file, very nice for keeping up with the minute details.
<P><A HREF="http://www.cws.org/~pasketti/eqlog.html" TARGET=_BLANK>Pasketti's Everquest Log Parser & Splitter</A> - Another log file parser, I have yet to use it but some people prefer it over Everlogs.
<P><A HREF="http://kqp.mpog.com/EQParse/" TARGET=_BLANK>EQParser</A> - Another log parser, though it always times out when trying to goto the site, this link might be getting the axe shortly.
<P>Hate those X10 pop-under ads?? So do I, Click <A HREF="http://www.x10.com/home/optout.cgi?DAY=365&PAGE=http://www.x10.com/x10ads1.htm" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A> to add a cookie to your system to kill those ads for 1 year. Even though the page you get will say 30 days, I have changed the cookie information to actually be 1 year, sneaky isn't it. :)
