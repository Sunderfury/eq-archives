<P><FONT SIZE=+3>SPDAT Changes Page</FONT></CENTER>
<P>For those not in the know, the spdat.eff file contains all the information regarding the various spells, songs and effects of Everquest. First to address the obvious question, "Can you alter the SPDAT file to make spells different?". Well I do not know, I doubt that VI would make it that easy to alter spell effects, but several peices of information can be found from looking within the hex code of the SPDAT file.
<P>Now VI in the past has posted fake data to the file so any information found here is all speculative.
<P>Well on with the changes.
<P>
<P>Okay I have decided to stop trying to keep this updated, a better job is being done on <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net" target=_blank>http://lucy.fnord.net</a>.

The biggest change of all is that VI has moved away from the spdat.eff file and now uses the spell_en.txt file for spell information. This will probably be an attempt for foreign languages versions of the spells to show translated text to the end users selected supported language. The caveat I see here is that VI has had problems keeping a single spdat file fixed, wonder how maintaining 4 or 5 different language versions will be. The added benefit of this is that this file is a delmited one, meaning that all the various bits of info are sererated by a ^ while the spdat was broken down into specific byte sizes. The text messages, spell names and such were limited to a fixed amount of space for descriptions, but now that it is character delimited VI can get more imaginative with spell names and the effect text. It also removes a restriction in that in the last used spdat there was only enough room based on its current size for 3000 spells and effects, now it is open-ended.
<LI>Will be working on the listing this afternoon.
