This list is subject to change. Current 10-23-2003<br><br>Windows are allowed to have any number and any combination of control definitions. Controls are drawn in order from first to last with the last drawn controls displaying on top. Window template tokens are not case sensitive.<br><br>Name<br>This is the name of the window. Names are typically all lowercase with words separated by underscores. These are what the interface uses to find the template data for a given window. These are not case sensitive.<br><br>CloseButton (bool)<br>This Boolean specifies whether the close button should be present or not. If this element is not present, the button is not present. The close button always goes into the upper right hand corner of the window.<br><br>MoveButton (bool)<br>This Boolean specifies whether the move button should be present or not. If this element is not present, the button is not present. The move button always goes into the upper left hand corner of the window. <br><br>TopRightResizeButton (bool)<br>This Boolean specifies whether the upper right resize button should be present or not. If this element is not present, the button is not present. The upper right resize button always goes into the upper right hand corner of the window. The close button and top right resize button cannot coexist peacefully.<br><br>BottomRightResizeButton (bool)<br>This Boolean specifies whether the bottom right resize button should be present or not. If this element is not present, the button is not present. The bottom right resize button always goes into the lower right hand corner of the window. This option supersedes resizeable two way width and height.<br><br>BottomLeftResizeButton (bool)<br>This Boolean specifies whether the bottom left resize button should be present or not. If this element is not present, the button is not present. The bottom left resize button always goes into the bottom left hand corner of the window. This option supersedes resizeable two way width and height.<br><br>ResizeButtonOffsetX (number)<br>This number specifies the X offset in pixels of the bottom left and bottom right resize buttons (but not the upper right resize button). For the bottom left resize button, the offset is from the left. For the bottom right resize button, the offset is from the right.<br><br>ResizeButtonOffsetY (number)<br>This number specifies the Y offset in pixels of the bottom left and bottom right resize buttons (but not the upper right resize button). For both buttons it is the offset from the bottom.<br><br>Width (number)<br>This is the width of the window in pixels.<br><br>Height (number)<br>This is the height of the window in pixels.<br><br>TitleWidth (number)<br>This is the width of the title area in pixels. The title area works the same way as the move button. If title area dragging is not desired, either the title height or title width can be set to 0 to disable the feature.<br><br>TitleHeight (number)<br>This is the height of the title area in pixels. The title area works the same way as the move button. If title area dragging is not desired, either the title height or title width can be set to 0 to disable the feature.<br><br>ResizeableWidth (number)<br>This is the width in pixels to make a window resizable in the X direction (i.e. left and right). Note that for the background to change width, it must have the alignment flag GrowWidth specified.<br><br>ResizeableHeight (number)<br>This is the height in pixels to make a window resizable in the Y direction (i.e. up and down). Note that for the background to change height, it must have the alignment flag GrowHeight specified.<br><br>ResizeableTwoWayWidth (number)<br>This number is the width in pixels of the corner areas that resize in two dimensions. This functionality has been replaced by the left and right bottom resize buttons. <br><br>ResizeableTwoWayHeight (number)<br>This number is the height in pixels of the corner areas that resize in two dimensions. This functionality ha been replaced by the left and right bottom resize buttons.<br><br>WindowId (id)<br>This is the window id. Many windows have constants for them but many do not. At the time of this writing, it is used only for debugging.<br><br>MinWidth (number)<br>This is the minimum width of a window in pixels. Strange visual errors can be had if the minimum width of a window is set too small. The minimum width of a window is computed as the minimum width of the most interior resize element plus the difference between the width of the window and the width of the element. A resize element in this case would be those controls that can resize horizontally (e.g. status bars and full resize images). The minimum width of a control that can be resized is the left width plus the right width.<br><br>MinHeight (number)<br>This is the minimum height of a window in pixels. Strange visual errors can be had if the minimum height of a window is set too small. The minimum height of a window is computed as the minimum height of the most interior resize element plus the difference between the height of the window and the height of the element. A resize element in this case would be those controls that can resize vertically (e.g. vertical scroll bars and full resize images). The minimum height of a control that can be resized is the top height plus the bottom height.<br><br>3.6 Event Reference<br>The following is a list of the events available in the ToA interface and their purpose in game. Many of these events require additional data that may not be settable by the UI. Where possible this is indicated in the comments. This list is subject to change.

É^ÉCÉgÉãÅF<font color=#FF9999><b>2 How-To</b></font><br>
<blockquote>2 How-To<br><br>This section contains some hands-on information with more of the specifics of how to do certain things. A general overview of the system can be found in section 2 and a reference for most of the system can be found in section 4.<br><br>2.1 Getting Started<br>Before creating a custom skin, do the following:<br>1) Create a directory named ÅgcustomÅh in the ToA UI directory (usually Mythic/Atlantis/ui)<br>2) Create a directory named ÅgoldstyleÅh in the new custom directory <br>3) Select the ÅgCustomÅh skin in the options menu<br><br>All changes made to the interface need to reside in the custom folder otherwise those changes will be overwritten the next time you log into the game (since it will patch them). Under no circumstances should the file Mythic/atlantis/ui/uimain.xml be modified &amp;#8211; as we said before, this file can and will be changed by our patch process.<br><br>If no other changes are made and the game is started, the interface should look exactly like the Atlantis skin. This is because if the system canÅft find a file, it defaults to look for it in the Atlantis folder. The ÅgoldstyleÅh directory is for the textures used for old style panels. Again, if these files do not exist, the system will default to the Atlantis skin versions of these that live in Mythic/data/Atlantis.<br><br>It is highly recommended that one of the Atlantis or realm-specific skins be used as the basis for custom skins especially given that the system defaults to the Atlantis directory if it canÅft find something. The templates for the Transparent, Isles, and Classic skins are very different. Furthermore, to avoid a lot of extra mod work when we convert or add a new window, it is recommended that template names not be changed. We will use the old set of templates. <br><br>Other helpful hints:<br>- get a good XML editor; it will make the modding process much easier<br>- keep backups of your files to avoid losing changes<br>- check the patch notes to see if any panels have been converted to windows or any windows have been added<br><br>2.2 Adding New Templates<br>There isnÅft anything tricky about adding a new template. New templates exist at the top level and can exist in any file. There are no ordering dependencies between templates since all XML data is loaded before any window is instantiated. Note that if a new template is added that has the same name as another template that has already been added, the system will discard the first one and keep the second one. <br><br>For ease of maintenance and development, the following things are recommended:<br>- put custom templates in their own file to avoid confusion<br>- keep the base templates around to avoid lots of rework when new windows are added<br><br>2.3 Adding Controls to Windows<br>Adding new controls to windows is as simple as adding a new control definition to an existing window template. Make sure if you assign a control ID to the new control that it isnÅft one of the ones that the window binds to in code. A listing of these is available in the reference section. Also, note that while it is possible to have controls that are outside the bounds of the window, these controls cannot be interacted with since interaction events only occur inside the bounds of a window.<br><br>One potential pitfall to adding controls to windows is that the order that they are listed in the window template is the order in which they are drawn. This is one of the only places in the new interface that ordering is important. Hence, if your background image is last in the window template, no other controls will be shown since the background will overdraw. <br><br>Common errors with adding new controls are:<br>- ordering issues can cause controls to not be seen<br>- ordering issues can cause controls to not receive events<br>- most errors are naming erors<br><br>2.4 Changing Textures<br>Adding new textures to the interface is a four step process (assuming that the assets already exists):<br>1. Copy the textures to the custom directory for controls and windows<br>2. Copy the old style textures to the custom/oldstyle directory for panels<br>3. Modify the file assets.xml to load the textures in the custom directory (the old style stuff doesnÅft need to be included here)<br>4. Modify the appropriate control templates to use the new textures<br><br>Texture coordinates start at (0, 0) from the top left corner. Negative texture coordinates and texture coordinates that are off the edge of the texture page are undefined. Texture coordinates are integers and always map 1:1 pixel for pixel in the interface (i.e., stretching textures is not supported).<br><br>2.5 Changing Icons<br>Icons in the game can be changed. An icon sheet is a 10x10 page containing 100 icons. Icon sheets should be bitmaps and have two resolutions: one that has 16x16 pixel icons and one that has 32x32 pixel icons. The names of the icon sheets are hard coded and can be found in the reference section. <br><br>Until all the old style panels are converted to windows, modified icons need to be copied to both the custom directory and the old style directory. <br><br>2.6 Adding a New Font<br>Fonts have their own very specific graphical requirements. Fonts must have an alpha channel. In the alpha channel, each character needs to be underlined precisely with a one pixel tall row of pure white. In the first pixel column on the left hand side, one pixel must denote where the rows of underlines are. It is important that all the rows on a given line be lined up exactly. It also helps if the distance between the single pixels is the same horizontally.<br><br>What all these special lines and pixels are doing is denoting where each character is in the file. The single pixels in the left hand column are denoting the line heights. If the line heights are different between the rows, the tallest one is used as the height of the font. The rows are denoting each character in the font. If thereÅfs a break in the line it will try to count the character as two. If thereÅfs a line missing, that character will be missing in the font. Each character must be present in the precise order that the other fonts are in or the font will display garbled text.<br><br>Data can be put in the RGB channels but color data will distort when changing font colors in game. Once the graphic files are prepared, a new Font must be added to the assets that the game loads. The file assets.xml has examples of this. <br><br>Note that the names Ågarial9Åh, Ågarial11Åh, and Ågarial14Åh are used for the resize font selectable in the front end UI. If they are not present, the game may not function properly. </blockquote></font></TT>

É^ÉCÉgÉãÅF<font color=#FF9999><b>1. Overview &amp; Definitions</b></font><br>
<blockquote>1. Overview &amp; Definitions<br><br>With Trials of Atlantis, we are introducing a new user interface system. When we sat down during the design phase, we talked about the limitations of our original, somewhat static system, and features our technologically savvy players might enjoy. (Please note that as with our other XML features, we will not be able to provide any individual assistance. Please do not attempt to do a custom mod if you aren't completely comfortable with these explanations and instructions.) The end result was a new system that is partially data driven in XML and highly configurable.<br><br>For the remainder of this document we use the following terms:<br>&amp;middot; A window is a single pane in the UI, usually displaying some data or having some control widgets that has been converted to the new system.<br>&amp;middot; A panel is a window in the old system that has not been converted (see the Continuing Work section for more details)<br>&amp;middot; A control is aÅc well, a widget! It could be a button, icon, image, etc. A window can also be described as a collection of controls.<br>&amp;middot; A skin is a set of texture data that redefines the graphical look of the interface. This includes repositioning data within a window.<br>&amp;middot; A mod is a rearrangement of the data and controls on one or more windows to suit a particular need. Functionality added to the interface through the system can also be a mod.<br>&amp;middot; An adapter is a piece of data used by the interface to control or display a given thing on one or more windows. All adapters are named.<br>&amp;middot; A control template is the data needed to draw a given control common to all controls of that type.<br>&amp;middot; A control definition is the specifics for a single control as that control is used in a particular window.<br>&amp;middot; A window template is the set of control definitions and window attributes that let the system create that window.<br><br>1.2 Data Storage &amp; Adapters<br>One of the biggest differences between the new and the old systems are how they deal with data. For the new system, all of the ÅgliveÅh data for the interface is stored in a place conveniently named the Ågdata storeÅh. The data store is basically a set of data that can be used to populate any number of different controls that make up the interface. Examples of the data stored here are: the name of the object being crafted on the timer window, the lines in the chat buffer, the color of each message type for the Chat Window, and the NPC dialog in the Interact Window.<br><br>Each piece of data is stored in an adapter. An adapter is a piece of data used by the interface to control or display a given thing on one or more windows. Every adapter has a name and can be accessed by a user mod. Furthermore, there are no hidden adapters in the UI, i.e., every adapter is available to users. The same adapter can be referenced any number of times by any number of controls on any window. <br><br>Adapters come in the following types distinguished by the type of data they contain:<br>&amp;middot; Scalar adapters contain numerical data, e.g., a characterÅfs strength, the percentage of a timer bar, or the icon number for the right-click Mini-info Window.<br>&amp;middot; Text adapters contain text data that is either single line or multi-line. Examples of text adapters are the title of the Timer Window when crafting and the data in the NPC Interact Window.<br>&amp;middot; A color adapter is RGBA color data that determines the color of something, usually text. Examples of these are the message colors in the Chat Window and the title color for the right-click Mini-info Window.<br>&amp;middot; A list box adapter is an adapter for a list box control that may or may not contain icons. Examples of these are the wares on the Merchant Window, the ÅgAdditional InfoÅh area of the character Stats Window, and the Concentration Window data.<br>&amp;middot; A special type of scalar adapter is the time of day adapter that runs the clock.<br><br>Certain controls can bind to certain types of adapters in the XML data. A controlÅfs display will change to reflect changes in the adapter(s) it is bound to. Hence, a hitpoint bar will move when the target takes damage. For the specifics of which controls can be bound to which adapters, see Reference Section 4.<br><br>1.3 Control Templates<br>A control template can be thought of as the pattern on how to make a specific flavor of a given type of control. This usually (but not always) contains font assignments, texture coordinates, sizes and offsets. Control templates never contain adapter bindings. The control template is what the system uses to draw each control that makes up a window. In general, most control types (buttons, image areas, status bars) have multiple templates to vary the look and feel of these controls in the interface. <br><br>1.4 Window Templates<br>A window template is the pattern on how to make a specific window. Windows, unlike controls, cannot be duplicated. The data in a window template includes a set of window attributes like width and height, and a list of the controls that it contains in the form of control definitions. <br><br>1.5 Control Definitions<br>A control definition is the specific instance data that is needed to put a control on a given window. Control definitions always live in a window template in the XML data. Control definitions always contain position information and can also include size data, font names, and adapter bindings. <br><br>1.6 Events<br>The ToA UI is partially event driven. This means that when a button is clicked it sometimes fires off an event to the appropriate game subsystem to affect the game in some way. This can be data driven which is handy for modding since it means that event driven functionality can be duplicated over multiple windows. Only certain controls can generate events and not all events in the game are data driven. For a listing of data-drivable events, see Reference Section 4. <br><br>1.7 Panels &amp; Skinning<br>Because the entire UI has not yet been converted to the new system, to make a completely new skin has a few extra steps. The old style panels have their own set of textures that they share that live in the data directory in the Atlantis folder. To skin panels, create versions of the appropriate textures and put them in the appropriate directory. Note that the positions of controls cannot be changed on panels. For a listing of which panels use which graphics, see the Reference Section.<br><br>1.8 Data Format<br>In general, any XML data file can contain any set of window or control templates in any order. In practice, most of the control templates are gathered into styles.xml and each window lives in its own xml file, e.g., chat_window.xml. Control definitions must exist as children of a window template otherwise they cannot be properly bound to a window.<br><br>Keywords in the XML data are not case sensitive but are spelling sensitive. Name bindings for templates and assets are also not case sensitive. Adapter names are case sensitive. Templates and assets can be arranged in any order in any file. All the XML data is loaded before any windows are instantiated to avoid unnecessary data dependencies. There is a special XML element that can be used to include other XML files. See the Reference section for Details.<br><br>Texture data can be in either BMP or TGA format. If transparencies are needed, a format with an alpha channel should be used. Font data has its own specific format (this will be explained in section 4). A note to Photoshop 7 users: there is a bug with early versions that prevents Photoshop to save TGA files correctly which will cause texture data to be improperly displayed in the interface. <br><br>Any file in the interface can be modified except uimain.xml which lives in the root ui folder (usually Mythic/Atlantis/ui/uimain.xml). This is a file that will be patched which controls which other files are loaded into the UI. This allows us to add new windows without requiring mod authors to make changes every time we patch. This has some caveats however, please refer to section 3.1: Getting Started for more details.<br><br>1.9 The Loading Process<br>When the ToA interface starts up it looks for the uimain.xml file in the root UI directory (usually Mythic/Atlantis/ui/uimain.xml). This file contains a listing of which other files to read and allows us to add new windows without breaking a lot of mods. Each file listed in uimain.xml is loaded each containing some subset of the interfaceÅfs template and definition data. <br><br>If ever a file canÅft be found, the system looks in the Atlantis folder for it. Note that because of this, only those files that need to be modified need be included in the custom directory that holds the custom skin. Barring all else, the system prints an error to ui.log in the root Atlantis directory if it still canÅft find a file. <br><br>All XML data files are loaded before any windows are brought up.<br><br>1.10 Continuing Work<br>At the time of the creation of this document, not all of the UI has been converted to the new system due to time constraints. Work is continuing to convert the interface to the new system but it is a time consuming project. </blockquote></font></TT>
