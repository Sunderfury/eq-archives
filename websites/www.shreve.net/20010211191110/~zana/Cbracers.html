  Twas a rather gloomy day, no one around, not much to do..so I decided to sit in Surefall Glades and continue my neverending task of making arrows to up my skill in fletching. Sitting and grumbling as to why I have not the Trueshot in hand, a Ranger friend  approached and greeted me. "From the scowl on your face and the tone in your whispers I can see you are fletching", He chuckled with the knowing of my ardent yet failing quest to make the bow. "Aye, still and yet", I responded roughly as I stood to greet him and replaced the scowl with a smile, "Tis good to see you again, Lorimar. What brings you here this day pray tell?" " I am off to Everfrost to start my quest for the ivy etched bracers", he explained. "Care to join me and rid yourself temporarily from this, ummmm, gruesome task?"<BR><BR>  
    "So you are to fight the mighty ice-orc Redwind", at which point I began to giggle, "He will be quite a challenge for your years I fear and his guards alone will pound you senseless". "Perhaps", Lorimar grinned sheepishly, "But I have been told that it is camped most regularly and at times those camping will more than willingly allow one to loot the rune of ivy needed for the quest".  "How ingenious!", I shouted out with glee as I stood to attention, "I am at your service for perhaps we can acquire two!"<BR><BR>
     We quickly packed our bags with food and water and set out on our adventure. I was to follow Lorimar for I had never ventured this area before and the first thing we had to do was find our way around BlackBurrow. Lorimar, though stating he knew his way was rather lost upon our onset. Being as I have been in this predicament on more than one occasion I was not concerned as I bid him to ask directions. We undoubtedly received much assistance in finding our way to Halas and had no difficulty at all getting bound there.<BR><BR> 
     I wandered around the town abit and found it quite beautiful. It was snow covered mostly but the small huts with fires burning beneath mantles and beds layered with quilts gave it a warmth and hominess that made it quaint and peaceful. I heard the voice of Lorimar echoing my name, "Carista! Where are you? Tis time to be on our way."
I rejoined him and we set out to find the icy orc palace which lay beyond the city. It was an ardorous journey for everything was just white. It was hard to find the paths we needed to take and though the river was iced over I feared falling into a hole, never to be seen again.<BR><BR> 
    We finally made our way to the icy orc camp and as Lorimar had stated, there was a camp already claiming the rights to the spawn of Redwind. I was quite relieved actually for I pondered what we would do otherwise. Lorimar set about asking the leader of the camp if we could loot the rune of ivy should it appear and if no one else wanted it. It was agreed that we could do so , also as Lorimar had predicted. We sat and chatted some as we waited and once in awhile Lorimar would pull a Mammoth elephant for an easy kill. In the by and by, the camp was struggling with the orcs protecting Redwind and then targeting the mighty Redwind himself, eventually informing us that there was indeed a rune to be picked. Lorimar retrieved the first since it was his quest to begin with and we sat and waited once again..<BR><BR> 
    Eventually, one from the group had to depart and they invited Lorimar to join them. He worried about what I would do but I prodded him on to join and I would sit and wait it out. They had succeeded in killing Redwind several times yet he held no rune stone. It was apparant that he did not have it each and every time. I waited and waited, standing at each kill for word to loot. It seemed forever when suddenly I was also invited to join the group. I was elated! I would actually partake in the killing of Redwind in order to get my rune piece for the quest!<BR><BR> 
    It did not take long for Redwind to appear, surrounded by four of his trusty guards. My adrenaline was flowing for the fight would not be easy. They decided to harmony two of the guards along with Redwind, fight the other two to their deaths and then pull the remaining two guards leaving Redwind for last. We fought victoriously, taking little damage and destroying them quickly. When it came time to pull the other two guards Redwind came running with them. The harmony failed as he ran forward seeming like a giant to me as he flailed his sword over the top of my head. The call rang out to attack Redwind first so I quickly turned my attention to him, trying hard to ignore the beating I was getting from one of his guards. I slashed and kicked as I slowly watched my life drain from me yet I would not run as a coward. I would die with honor if need be. Suddenly the giant orc fell to the ground and a shout of victory rang in the air, "Carista has killed Redwind with a final blow!" I was stunned, the glory of the slaying was mine though the group really did the better part of the damage. We easily picked off the other two guards and the group cheered of the great battle just fought. I was told to loot Redwind and as I knelt down and reached in his pocket I could feel the smoothness of a small stone. I retrieved it and held it up for all to see. Twas the ivy rune stone I had been hoping for! I jumped for joy , hugged Lorimar and danced with the members from my group as they laughed at my gaeity over such a simple object.<BR><BR>
   As I wound down and we all sat to recover and mend our wounds Lorimar announced that we must take leave for we needed to travel to the other side of the world to continue on with our quest. We bid our new found friends goodbye, wished them good hunting and safe keeping and headed out with me following Lorimar once again.<BR><BR>
   It was a long journey for sure. The rain pelted us as we made our way through the Karanas. The night engulfed us as we traveled the mountains of Highhold always keeping myself in reach of my companion. It seemed like we ran endlessly, hardly a word spoken, until finally reaching the gates of Freeport. We stopped for a brief moment to look over our inventory, refresh our supplies and then headed to the docks to wait for the boat. I was rather pleased that the boat was not there yet for I could sit and relax, reflect over our victory and question our next venture forth coming. Lorimar instructed me that we would take the boat to Faydwer and travel on to Dagnor's Cauldron where we would seek out a water ring from an Aqua Goblin Tidal Lord. He explained that the same thing would probably hold true as before. That the place will be camped and we will ask for the right to loot the Goblin if he should hold the ring.<BR><BR> 
    The boat arrived as he finished his summation and we boarded with anticipation to finishing our quest. Arriving in Butcher Block we immediately headed to Dagnor's Cauldron and found the camp of the Tidal Lord. It was vacant of other adventurers and I pondered how we would accomplish this task alone. Lorimar and I sat a distance away and discussed strategy. We weighed the odds of death. We scrutinized what moves we would make and how to assist each other. It was decided we would just attack the Tidal Lord himself, kill him as quickly as we can and then run to the zone in hopes that we could return in time to retrieve his corpse.<BR><BR> 
   The Tidal Lord appeared as we talked and along with him were two of his faithful companions. Lorimar smiled at me and with a tinge of apprehension and a gust of confidence asked me if I was ready. I breathed deeply and replied with but one word, "Aye". Lorimar stood and with a blast of fire bolting from his hands the Tidal Lord came running towards us with his companions in close pursuit. I was terrified as I tried to cast spell upon spell, kicking and slashing, feeling the foul breath of the goblins who hovered over me as they attacked. Lorimar was in dire trouble. His life was draining quickly and he yelled to run. I could see that the Tidal Lord was also near his demise. I could only hope to kill him soon before I, myself, would be laying at his feet. I continued on with my attack, determined that I would have the killing blow and he fell at my feet as his companions continued to batter me. I ignored their attacks and reached down to remove the ring from the Tidal Lord's finger. Just as I slipped it completely off I received a blow to my head that left me unconsious and bleeding. Within seconds the life was drained from me and I died. <BR><BR>
   I had been returned to Kaladim where we had bound ourselves and Lorimar was waiting for me. He had died as well though I thought he had managed to escape. I told him that I think I had the ring but was not sure for I died quickly afterwards. We ran back to the camp and I found my body. As I retrieved my belongings I looked eagerly for the ring. It was not there. I sat dismayed at the fruitless efforts that led to my death in order to get the ring. Lorimar frowned and hugged me and asked me to see if perhaps it might be in one of my backpacks. I searched through my packs one by one and reached deep into the last and held out an object to show Lorimar. With a broad grin on my face, Lorimar exclaimed, "The ring!!"  We rejoiced with dancing and drink and though Lorimar had yet to get his ring he informed me that he had to take leave and would get it another time. I wished him luck to this, hugged him and thanked him for his help and we parted.<BR><BR>
   I was tired yet there was only one thing left to do and I wished to complete it this day. I was to return to Freeport and purchase a fire emerald and then bring all these things to Morin Shadowbane in Kithicor Forest where by she would give me the ivy bracer. I ran back to the dock and waited for the boat once again. Upon boarding the boat I sat and closed my eyes. I felt fulfilled and thanked Tunare for her guidance and presence in the tasks that I fortook this day, hoping that she would stay with me to the ending of it.<BR><BR> 
   Reaching Freeport I found the merchant to buy the gem from and headed to the entrance to Kithicor Forest. I made note of the time and found I had hours to wait until morning when it would be safe to travel. While I sat I received a message from a dear friend, Ruvaren. He asked what I was up to and I told him of my past adventures and how I was determined to complete this quest. He informed me that he would be passing through this area to reach an engagement and would be more than happy to escort me to Morin to insure my safety. I was more than pleased to his offer and accepted it in gratitude. As day broke he had arrived and was waiting for me in Morin's hut. I ran as fast as I could and upon entering her hut I saw Ruvaren. I beamed a smile at him, feeling safe and confident of completing this quest. He grinned broadly at me as well and informed me to be quick with my business for he had to leave soon.<BR><BR> 
I turned to speak with Morin and was suddenly being attacked by her. Ruvaren shouted, "Run!" as I felt the spirit of the wolf enter me. I quickly ran out the door, never looking back and made my way to the nearest zone. As most commonly happens I took a wrong path and met a dead end having to turn around and backtrack to the zone. I feared she would be chasing me but I found her no where in sight as I reached the zone to safety. It was at this point that I realized the jeopardy that Ruvaren may have been in. He had helped me and Morin did not appreciate that fact and started after him. Tis probably why she did not pursue me for she was then attacking him. Yet as I entered the zone, there was Ruvaren sitting calming and upon seeing me he stated amusingly, "So what do you do for an encore, Carista?" I was terribly embarrassed, my cheeks blushed to their fullest red and I apologized profusely. He just chuckled and stated that although he would like to see the outcome of this venture he had to move on. I hugged him, thanked him for his assistance and bade him a goodbye.<BR><BR>
   I sat and pondered now if Morin would remember me upon my return or at best forgive me for the attack. It seems that instead of hailing her I did indeed strike her which caused this incident. I cautiously ran back to her hut and cringing with my eyes closed I hailed her once again. With relief she seemed to have forgotten the incident and I gave her the items she asked for receiving then the ivy etched bracer.<BR><BR> 
   This was my very first true quest and how it went. I had a much easier time going through the all of it a second time in order to acquire the other bracer. <BR><BR> 

The End....<BR><BR>
