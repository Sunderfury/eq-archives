	<TD><B>This is the first picture I ever took. It's a Hill Giant that I met in West Commons. I thought I had time to run after taking this picture but, alas, he squashed me like a bug. Nice pic, though, eh?</B></TD>

	<TD><B>A Spectre in Oasis of Marr. They say that they can see invisible so either this is a fallacy or the guy just liked me. I think they look really cool though..agreed?</B></TD>
