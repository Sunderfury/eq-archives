<CENTER><B>Kudos to Nypalmo Weedblaze for reaching his 50th season!! Well done, M'Lord!!</B></CENTER><BR>
<B><CENTER>---------------------</CENTER></B><BR>
We have four ways of communication within our guild. Guildsay..email..homepage..and message board. I spent some time last month emailing all the members so that I could to get these sources out to all. One source is obviously guildsay within the game. I ask that any information you know of that you inform your fellow members via guildsay...as in raids, gatherings, etc. We also have the emailings that I send out...but these will be far and inbetween and only as felt necessary. <BR><BR>
What I wish to talk about is the homepage and the message board and how they interact with one another yet are separate....and why I ask all to take a look at the homepage at least at the beginning of each month. Why do I ask this? Because there is a calendar of events on the homepage that is much easier to read than trying to decipher all the posts on the message board to get the necessary info for an event...because the lockers are updated at the beginning of each month so it is kept up to date and all can see what is there...and because you can read this ;)<BR><BR>
The homepage is a reference page mostly. It has our code, our members list, our gallery link and message board link and all the other things that might be of interest. Its a good source for people interested in joining out guild. I have heard that it is the best place to get the upcoming events info quickly and that's it's purpose. The homepage also talks about things going on within our guild... What our hopes are for the future and how we are striving to make them happen. It also gives input on what the Leader is doing in making for a better guild.<BR><BR>
The message board on the other hand is a posting place. It is an open forum for all to contribute their thoughts at any given time. I sometimes take what I read off the message board and correlate it into the homepage. We suggest raids and the like but the info is scattered on the message board. I know that the message board is our main source of communication but it cannot control organization to an event or to a guild. I find most people go to the message board and hardly ever visit the homepage. My thought is that at least they go to the message board. I ask that members start looking at the homepage more and see what we really have here. If there is something you would like to contribute to the homepage its just a small matter of sending me an email. <BR><BR>
One last word on the message board...slams will not be tolerated. I have mentioned this at various times and perhaps it wasn't read. We have put a great effort into having a good message board. We have allowed this board to be open to visitors and friends yet at the same time having a private forum for members only to relate what they might be having problems with within the guild. There are ways to solve problems..I have added new Officers to help with being available. The worst thing that could happen to a guild is an outburst in a public message board forum let alone even a private one. I have Officers who are probably the best in all of Norrath. They are there for you! They have proven their worth in supporting the guild, in their devotion to all members in the guild. If you applaud them then also go to them when you need advise to a situation that might cause you to discredit the guild with an outburst out of anger. Remember, what you do or say can reflect on the guild as a whole.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>--------------------------------------------</B></CENTER><BR>
Lockers.....As talked about in our meeting last month I have placed some items up on the message board as last call items from the Lockers. These items will be turned over to Tamato at the beginning of this month to either give to newbies, to try to sell to the general public or to simple sell to vendors. The proceeds will go into the Guild chest to be used for events, etc. I will then continue on adding a few more items to the board this month that I deem worthless to us. I ask if it would be a good idea to designate one day a month that I will make myself available for exchanges to the lockers. I tried this one day but there seemed to be no interest. Over time I expect our lockers will contain some of the more "elite" items that people are looking for. Casters..this is a good place to ask for people to watch for and deposit some of them hard sought after words and runes. Enchanters...the same holds true with gems. Actually many trade skills can benefit from the lockers if people know what you are needing. The Guild chest was initially designed to pass down items you don't have use for. I expect the ones who would benefit most are members who start secondary chars within the guild. Yet no one is really using this locker system. I expect in due time it will be totally eliminated due to lack of interest. As holding the locker items I see what comes and goes...therefore I shall be picky about what is being given. I appreciate all those who have and who continue to want to donate things and my refusing to take them is certainly not meant to be unappreciative. I expect if I say that we really can't use something that you will sell it and keep the coin for yourself for if I take these things it seems obvious that they will end up being sold at a later date in time.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>--------------------------------------</B></CENTER><BR>
Gallery.....I have recently added many pictures taken at the Mistmore raid last month. I also included a couple more pictures of some of our members. Please check the "Family" section and if you don't see your pic up there try to send me one. I try to take a few pics as I see members in the game, if I remember to do so. I'd like to see a more completed album of our members. Also, if you would like your picture updated, send that to me as well. I am also going to get together with Exedeus, coordinator of our Gallery, to see if we should start removing some of the older events as we place up new ones. This will keep the Gallery looking neat and not overcrowded. If there are any pictures you wish to keep for your personal use, feel free to download them. <BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>---------------------------------------</B></CENTER><BR>
Raids....After the Mistmore raid, our Officers discussed how to proceed with raids. We have all learned something from this raid and we are going to strive to work on better performance to them. We are going to down grade our raids a wee bit to learn tactics, organization and discipline. We are also closing all raids to just the guild for the time being. This does not mean that any small band of members who wish to partake in other raids can't do so. The raids that will be coming up this month will be safely scrutinized and organized. I have asked Exedeus and Gwaltron to help members who wish to sponsor a raid. At this time the board is packed with ideas for raids but no one seems to be making a move. We would like members who want to do a raid to be involved in the creating of it so please by all means get with Exe or Gwal asap. They don't bite ;)<BR><BR>
Our hopes are that we can become a Guild that can be successful with most raids. This will have quite an effect with planning raids with other guilds. Our dream is actually to become a sought after guild for having good raids. And needless to say, we have many members who are ready to do plane raids. If we can't control a simple raid how are we to achieve success at a higher scale such as the planes? So as simple as some of these up coming raids may seem, they are going to be organized and planned out as if it was a truelly dangerous area. And trust me..some of these areas have not even been seen by some members of our guild. So as we plan these raids we ask for as much participation to them. We also ask that if you sign up for a raid to please make sure that the time is suitable to you and that you will make your best effort to be there. There's nothing worse than having to spend a great deal of time waiting on people or having to reorganize groups because of no shows. I urge all to read the articles that Exedeus has placed on the message board concerning raid organization. They are very good and will help everyone know what is to be expected. Also, I have a link on the main page to various links...one being Allakazam's page. This site has many links to maps. It is advised that you print out the map of the place we will be raiding. It will give you some insight as to what lies ahead and where you will be going. <BR><BR><BR><BR>
