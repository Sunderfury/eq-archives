She walks through the forest, a warm lazy day befitting a short stroll. She comes upon her favorite tree where she likes to sit and ponder on days such as this. Inscribed in the tree is a heart shape with her name, long ago etched by herself, still vacant of any others but her own. She sighs and sits, closing her eyes to the sun.<BR><BR>
Suddenly a whisper catches her ear, "Xana". Opening her eyes she beholds a small faerie type figure standing on the petal of a flower near by. "Hmmmm", she mutters, raising a brow. "Greetings Lady Xanadu", its little voice rising to be heard. "Do you know who I am?" Xanadu laughs in jest, "Well, you look to be the one called Cupid so many seem to know, but since I believe there is no such creature, then I must answer that I know not who you are."<BR><BR>

Cupid frowning and shaking his head retorts, "Oh Ye of little faith!" Xana grimaces and points above her. "Oh Ye of little arrows, Cannot you read? Tis easy enough for there is but one name inscribed." Cupid folds his arms and begins to tap his foot. "I have used many an arrow for your sake, yet you refuse the offerings each and every time. I will finally admit that who you desire does not require one of my arrows for he already exists but your friendship to him clouds your true feelings to each other." Xana leans back and closes her eyes once again. "Hmmmm, you know nothing."<BR><BR>

Cupid, becoming maddened by Xanadu's sarcasm, grabs an arrow from its holder and strikes the top of it across the bottom of his tiny boot. The tip ignites into a flame and turns a bright red. Cupid places the arrow between his bow and fires it into the tree above Xana's head. Xanadu quickly crawls away lest her hair begin to blaze. As the arrow burns into the tree, Xana turns to see Cupid laughing crazily at her, "Hahahahahahahah!" In a wink he disappears, his echo slowly fading.<BR><BR>

Rising, she walks to the tree, finding the arrow to also be gone and inscribed within the heart, beneath her name is the name of one she knows so well.....MARDIL<BR><BR>

Happy Valentine's Day Darling!<BR><BR>

Love,   Xana : )
