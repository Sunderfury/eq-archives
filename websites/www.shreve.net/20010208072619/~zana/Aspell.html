<B>I regard research as one of the more important skills a caster has.  Due to the high price of words and the uncertainty of skill gain while doing actual research I choose to keep mine maxed by using practices with my trainer.  While this can be expensive after a while, it's nowhere near as expensive as paying the prices of the gouging player-merchants for words that they themselves have no use for.  In all fairness, there are some players who offer words at a reasonable price and many casters freely donate words and other research items they don't need.<BR><BR>
As a Necromancer, one is concerned with words and words only.  We need no runes, pages, shards, ices, bloods etc.  Words are it.  You will need to take these words and combine them using a Book of Dark Bindings.  There is a table below listing the spells I have researched thus far.  All of them were researched by me at the level needed to cast the spell with my research skill maxed.  The one exception so far is the spell Vampiric Curse, at which I failed twice with my research skill maxed at level 31. I was finally able to make it on my third attempt, with research maxed at level 32.  It is possible I could have made it before 32 had I been luckier, but I didn't have access to the words needed for more than two tries before then.  The table is set up with the spell level first, name of the spell and then words needed to research it.  The (a) and (b) after some words indicates the azia/beza variation of the word. Each spell name is a link to a brief description of the spell itself.  Good luck with your spell crafting...</B><BR><BR>

<B><A NAME="banshee"></A>Banshee Aura - Not much to say here since I don't use it.  This spell is essentially a damage shield, I believe, and I'd rather avoid being hit than continually re-mem and cast a spell that will only do a tiny bit of damage while I get beat on.  You need a pearl in your inventory to cast this.  It won't use up the pearl, you just need one.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="voice"></A>Voice Graft - As far as I know there is no real use for this spell beyond amusing yourself and others.  You cast it on your pet and then, when your pet is targeted, whatever you say appears to be said by the pet.  Good for laughs, but that's it.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="16pet"></A>Restless Bones - The 16th level pet spell.  You need this one.  I'm not sure if it's for sale by a vendor anywhere.  If anyone knows if or where it can be bought, please let me know.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="hungry"></A>Hungry Earth - This is a root spell that affects only the Undead.  It's quite useful in places like Unrest where there are hordes of them.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="vortex"></A>Shadow Vortex - I used to use this spell quite a bit before they changed it.  In it's present form it steals a little AC from the target and adds it to yours.  It can be used to make it slightly easier for your pet and other party members to hit the target.  I made use of it until somewhere in the low 20s, I believe.  It also creates a nice lightshow and is fun to cast. {g}<BR><BR>

<A NAME="harmshield"></A>Harmshield - This is a very limited duration invulnerability spell.  Good if you can't get gate off and have to run for a zone.  I don't think you can attack while this one is active.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="ident"></A>Identify - This will identify whatever item you or your target is holding (dangling from the cursor).  It can help in situations like the Shadowbound Armor quests where you have two Sceptres that look exactly alike and only have "a sceptre" as a description.  You can use identify to sorth them back out if you forget which is which.  You can also buy this spell at the Mage/Enchanter guild in Neriak Commons.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="word"></A>Word of Shadow - An area effect damage spell.  It's area is small and the damage isn't that great.  Basically, you have to be surrounded by enemies for it to have it's full effect and at that point things are not going well.  Might be good for aggroing herds of skeletons if you're a bone chip camper.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="20pet"></A>Animate Dead - 20th level pet spell. Get it, cast it, love it.  This is another one I'm not sure if you can buy from a vendor.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="sight"></A>Shadow Sight - A self-only spell that bestows ultravision.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="petbuff"></A>Intensify Death - A nice pet buff.  It seems to increase attack speed, hps and damage. I keep it memorized because it wears off rather quickly and it takes a long time to re-mem.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="breath"></A>Breath of the Dead - A self-only water breathing spell.  I'm not sure if this one requires a reagent like the water breathing spells of some other classes or not.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="24pet"></A>Haunting Corpse - 24th level pet spell.  Yes, at last you have a dark-boned pet. ;)  Again, I don't know if you can purchase this anywhere.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="29pet"></A>Summon Dead - 29th level pet spell.  Happy day!  Now you have a dark-boned pet with dual wield. ;)  This one I know can be bought at the Shadow Knight's guild in Ogguk.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="renew"></A>Renew Bones - A pet healing spell.  I use it occasionally to reduce downtime.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="vamp"></A>Vampiric Curse - A DoT that acts as a lifetap.  Looks like an AE spell, the gem is blue.  Not sure if you get more gain from multiple targets or what the radius is.  <BR><BR>
