<B><A HREF="http://www.i1.net/~theshaws/page3.htm">Diane's Page About Ireland</A> is by far the best page of links I have seen.  It will have something for everyone from links to gaelic language sites to emigration and job opportunities in Ireland.  I can't recommend this site highly enough.</B><BR><BR>

<B><A HREF="http://www.cormican.com">Cormican's Irish Home Page</A> is a good place to start if you're looking for Irish things on the web. </B> <BR><BR>

<B>If you are in any way interested in Irish history and enjoy well-written books of historical fiction with a healthy dash of the Otherworld thrown in then you should visit <A HREF="http://celt.net/Boru/">Morgan Llywelyn's page</A>.  Her books are mostly novels in which the myths and legendary figures of ancient Ireland are brought to life for the modern reader.  She was also courteous enough to respond to the e-mail I sent her.</B><BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://sinnfein.ie"><B>The official Sinn Fein site</B></A> <B>is well constructed  and quite informative for those interested in the controversy in Northern Ireland.  While I don't agree with all of their proposals, I do sympathize with their desire to peacefully obtain an end to British influence in Northern Ireland and the consolidation of the island into one nation.</B><BR><BR>

<B>If you're a lot more interested in politics than I am you can go check out the <A HREF="http://www.irlgov.ie/">Irish Government's page</A>.</B><BR><BR>

<B>I'm going to order the <A HREF="http://www.irishheritage.com/">Kane Ancestral Map of Ireland</A> soon.  When I get it I'll post my opinion of it.  All I can say for now is it looks really cool on their site and it's not too expensive, either.</B><BR><BR>

<B><A HREF="http://www.guinness.ie">Guinness....</A>  wouldn't you like a pint right now?  This is a really fun site...</B><BR><BR>

<B>Here's a nice site about <A HREF="http://www.hursley.ibm.com/Ireland/coins/coins.html">Irish money</A>.  There are detailed descriptions of coins from the most ancient to the modern along several very good pictures.  Includes pictures and an explanation of Irish Gunmoney also, a thing I was ignorant of until I looked through these pages.</B><BR><BR>

<B>Check out the whiskey that comes from the oldest licensed distillery in the world (you can look at the website, too, if you like).  Yes, it's <A HREF="http://www.bushmills.com/">Bushmills Irish Whiskey</A> from the town of Bushmills in County Antrim.  This site is best viewed while sipping a glass of Busmills poured over ice...

<B>Enter....the Celts...  For history lovers this is an account of the <A HREF="http://personal.lig.bellsouth.net/~origami/celt1.html">first appearance of the Celts</A> in ancient literature and it's a rousing good tale!</B><BR><BR>

<B>For you craft-lovers there is <A HREF="http://www.ils.ie/celtic/index.shtml">Celtic Cross Stitch</A>.  They have a variety of Irish/Celtic patterns ranging from cutsey Irish blessings to Illuminated letters from the Book of Kells.  My personal favorite is a pillow cover with nine interlocking rings of Celtic knotwork in a two-color pattern.</B><BR><BR>

<B><A HREF="http://wvnvm.wvnet.edu/~cna00104/index.html">Chrys' Page of Celtic Stuff</A> is a very nice place with searchable links, downloads for Celtic icons and animations and lots of other excellent features.  I really like this place...</B><BR><BR>

<B>I found most of the above sites listed in <A HREF="http://celt.net/og/ething.htm">Every Celtic Thing on the Web</A>, a huge link list dedicated to any and every thing Celtic.</B><BR><BR>
