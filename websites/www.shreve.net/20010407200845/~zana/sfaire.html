<H4><A HREF="http://www.iitexas.com/gpages/fairem.htm">Scarborough Faire</A> is a Rennaisance Festival that we visit several times each year.  It is located just off of I-35 on exit 399A about 15 miles south of Dallas, TX, and is a weekends only event that begins around the end of April and ends in mid June.  We took some pictures this year ('98).  If you'd like to see them just click on the links below.</H4><BR><BR>

<A HREF="s3.html">Knights</A> - A few knights riding about with banners flying etc.<BR><BR>
<A HREF="s4.html">Roland</A> - An interesting wanderer we met last year.  He makes the rounds of all the Faires near us taking photographs as he goes.  He's also written a book which is coming out in July, I think...<BR><BR>
<A HREF="s5.html">Queen Anne</A> - A nice picture of the Queen, taken by Xana.  The Queen of Scarborough is a very gracious person and always makes us feel very welcome when we speak to her.<BR><BR>

<A HREF="s6.html">Bestowing Honors</A> - At 4:00 each afternoon the King and Queen hold audience with the children at the Faire, making them Knights and Ladies of the Court of Scarborough.  This is a very cute thing to watch...<BR><BR>
