	<H3>Greetings and welcome to my home...</H3></CENTER><BR>
	
	<B>Let me introduce myself...I am Carista of Locsley, Woodelf Ranger that resides in Norrath, Everquest on the Innoruuk server. This page is devoted to what I know about being a Ranger... my travels, experiences and the knowledge that I have incurred during my travels in Norrath.<BR><BR>Since this is my personal homepage I have a biography of my char and also a picture of my camp which does exist. It is located in Lake Rathe at the gypsy place and tis where I go at times to think or perhaps visit with a friend. My camp is welcome to all friends traveling about that area, a place to relax and rest themselves and to get out of the rain even.<BR><BR>   This page will also have stories of my ventures, pictures of places I have been and things I have seen, and my comments on the skills and trades that I have accrued while hunting and questing this land. I am going to consider this mostly a newbie site for Rangers since what I have learned starts out as such and continues on as I explore and grow. I hope you will find my home here interesting if anything.... </B><BR><BR>
