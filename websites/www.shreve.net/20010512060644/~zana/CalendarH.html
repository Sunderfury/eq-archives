<B>This page breaks up our calendar into three sections...past, present and future month. This way you can see what has taken place and how it turned out..what's going on for this month...and what may take place in the next as it draws near. Scheduled events will be posted on a mini calendar in which you can click on the date and be taken to a description and time of the event.<BR><BR>
In trying to keep up with all information received I am perplexed as to where to place some of it. New members will be announced within the month they are brought into the guild, guild events will undoubtedly be added to the month they are to be held in and any urgent announcements will also be placed in the current month. All other tidbits of information will be placed in the month coming. This will insure promptness to all guild actions, keep the calendars from becoming overly lengthy and will also prevent my desk from becoming littered with little sticky notes ;)
