<B>Given here are the quests that I have done thus far. They are what I call "true quests" which are not just camping certain areas or crits for a dropped item. And to date what I have done are considered "Ranger only" quests. They are quite lengthy for I am going into detail as to how to go about doing them, at least as I have done them and I hope they will be helpful and not confusing. If you are not really interested in these quests just click on this here....<A HREF="Locsley.html"><FONT COLOR="#33FFCC">"HOMEPAGE"</FONT></A>. You can also click on the swords after each quest to bring you back to the contents.</B><BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H3><B>"TRUESHOT LONGBOW QUEST"</B></H3></CENTER><BR>
This quest is deceiving I think...you get the impression that at the end of it you will have this really cool bow in hand....NOT!!!!  You get a stave that is needed to actually make the bow, is all. And to make the bow you have to be about 65 skill levels above the mastered stat of 100 in fletching!!! So go figure!!!!<BR>
Anyway....this is a very long quest and here is how to go about getting the The Trueshot Long "Stave":<BR><BR>

First you have to go see Maeyn Trueshot who resides in the Emerald Warriors Guild in Kelethin...hail him and follow the procedures for quests by asking him about  the things he relates to you in brackets.  He will give you a backpack and tell you what items you need to make this "stave" and also where to go and who to see to get them.  You are to place all these items in the backpack , COMBINE them all and return the pack to him. Here is the list he will give you.....<BR><BR>

a micro servo - found on a rouge clockwork in Steamfont Mountains...you can get them off the runaway clockworks as well and I've had pretty good luck just hanging around the area near the windmills.<BR><BR>

dwarven wire - this is near a quest in itself.  You have to go to Kaladim and find a dude named Trantor Evershot. Hail him and ask about dwarven wire. He will ask you to go get him two Trumpy Tonics and in turn will give you the wire. He will tell you that you can get these tonics from Trumpy Irontoe, who also resides in Kaladim.<BR><BR>

Now once you find Trumpy Irontoe and hail him, ask him about getting some Trumpy Tonics.  He will tell you that you need a kiola nut and a water flask per tonic.  You can buy the kiola nuts on Sister Island and I will warn Ya now that you can't use foraged or summoned water...it has to be vendor bought water. Sooo, you have to go to the dock and get on the boat and circle around to Sister Island.  The hut that sells the nuts is the very first hut off the pier so is simple enough....{a reminder that you need to buy two kiola nuts to make two tonics so Trantor will be happy and give you the wire}.<BR><BR>

Now go back to Kaladim and hail Trumpy Irontoe once again. Give him ONE nut and ONE vendored water , each in a slot...and he will give you one tonic.  Do this again with the other nut and a water to get the other tonic.  Now ya got two tonics...so go back to Trantor Evershot and hail him.  Give him both the tonics but DON'T STACK THEM!!!  One per slot. He will give you a dwarven wire and a little experience bonus for your trouble ;)<BR><BR>

Next thing to get is the treant wood...you have to go to Freeport to get this. Nooooo....don't be going to South Karana and killing treants to get it!!!  When you get to Freeport go to the West gate area and find the Hogcallers Inn.  Upstairs in a room is a man name of Jyle Windshot.  Hail him and ask him about treant wood. He is kind of a weinie and won't go to East Freeport to get a small lantern so he finds this a good opportunity to have you do it for him;)  You might be able to find small lanterns elsewhere but I was always able to locate one at the inn just inside the entrance to the southgate of freeport near the pier.  Make sure it is a SMALL lantern that you purchase.  Bring this back to Jyle and give it to him and he will give you some shards of wood....this is the treant wood you need from him though it doesn't really say its treant wood.<BR><BR>

Now all ya need is the spiderling silk.  You could have got this in Steamfont off the spiderlings roaming about there or you can get them in East Commons, the zone just beyond the West gate of Freeport. Matters not where or when you get it in this quest, you just need to have one.<BR><BR>

Now  that you have all the items...micro servo, dwarven wire, treant wood and spiderling silk...place them all in the backpack that Maeyson Trueshot gave you and hit combine.  You shouldn't be able to open the pack after that.  Go back to Kelethin and give the backpack to Maeyson and he will reward you with the treant stave!!!! Yippeee!  Now what?<BR><BR>

Wellllll...if your fletching skill is way up there you can attempt the bow or else find someone who's very good at fletching and have them do it for you.  I prefer as long as I'm going to do this quest that I'll go all the way with it and try to make the bow myself.  You can question Maeyon Trueshot on how to make the bow and he will tell you the components needed. They are as follows:<BR><BR>

the treant staff<BR>
another dwarven wire<BR>
another micro servo<BR>
planing tool - you can purchase this from any vendor who sells bow components..they are expensive but 
                        fortunately if you fail at making the bow you'll get to keep the planing tool.<BR><BR>

Once you get all these items place them in your fletching kit, hit combine and hope for the best.<BR><BR>
You will notice that you need another wire and servo so if you think ahead while you are doing that part of the quest you might want to double up on those.  Then you won't have to repeat it in order to make the bow. You will have to talk with Maeyson again in order to get the backpack needed to combine the stuff for the stave.<BR><BR> 

Since about level 85 skill level in fletching to date, which is 127 I have failed 5 times in trying to make this bow.  There are a couple things to consider as well...first of all, the Trueshot Longbow goes for about 200pp on the market.  And once you have the bow, you cannot make another as long as it is in your possession be it inventory or bank. I have read in several places that if you buff up your wisdom and intelligence that your chances of success at making the bow will be greater.  I'm going to try this with my next attempt, borrowing as many wis and itel items that I can from friends.  I usually gather the items in quantity so I can try at least four attempts at the bow in succession.  Sometimes I ponder that instead of spending a ton of coin to up your skill level after having Mastered it that if you have the time and patience to fart around for awhile, you can do this quest over and over until you meet with success.  All it will cost you basically is the price of the kiola nuts and some small lanterns...a small price compared to the coin I've lost in making arrows and selling them back to the vendor in order to gain skill levels.<BR><BR>

Well that's it for this quest!!!  Good luck to you!!!<BR><BR>

<H3><B><CENTER>"IVY ETCHED TUNIC"</CENTER></B></H3><BR>

The ivy etched armor are Ranger only. Though the majority of the items needed to do the quests are "no drop", the end result is sellable. These quests are not that involved but are rather difficult being that most of the crits you have to kill are probably around a level 35 and surrounded by fellow crits who are near as tough... I wouldn't suggest even trying a portion of these quests until at least level 25 with help and some until you are over level 30. Some of these items are camped pretty heavily and it is possible to go there and ask the camp if you can have the item if no one wants it and most often they will oblige. I have done this but fortunately was able to eventually join in these groups and actually participate in the getting of these items ;) One thing about these ivy quests that I should mention...each requires a certain rune and if you get more than one rune before turning them in for your armor piece, be cautious of which rune is which because they are all different yet look the same and you will have a hard time giving the right rune to the npc thereby failing to get the armor piece and losing all the items you accumulated for it. Also, you can either go visit the npc, who is Morin Shadowbane at the Ranger camp in Kithicor Forest, prior to doing the quest and talk with her to find out what you need or just go get the items if you know what they are and then bring them to her..which is what I did. So, what I'm saying is you don't have to go see her first to activate the quest. I will also mention that Kithicor Forest is a very dangerous place and you are safest to run its path during the daytime hours of about 8am to 4pm, Everquest time.<BR><BR>I fortunately had the assistance of my dear friend, Vicarious, a level 50 wizard, when I did the ivy tunic quest. The first thing we had to do was get the "Skull of Meldrath" in Steamfont Mountains. This was the hardest part of the quest because we had to go deep into the dungeon and Meldrath is protected by some pretty nasty guards. I did die once in our attempt, yes..even with a level 50 at my side, and we were lucky to get another person to join us in our endeavor. With some strategy we pulled it off and I got my skull.<BR><BR>Now we had to get a "rune of ivy" off of Thistle Underbrush, a brownie in Lesser Fay. Being a Ranger and able to track, this was not too difficult to do. We just ran around the all of Lesser Fay until I had him on track. He is very fast though so you have to target him quickly and root him or you'll lose him. Be cautious of where you are running though for you could put yourself in danger in some areas of Lesser Fay. Anyway, I tracked him, found him, we blasted him and I got my rune ;)<BR><BR>The only thing left to do was to purchase 2 rubies that I found at a vendor in North Freeport in the light blue building before you enter the market place..{cost me about 165 plat with my charisma buffed some}.. and head to Kithicor Forest to turn this all in. When you hail Morin, be sure to tell her you want the tunic for she offers other items as well.<BR><BR>

<H3><CENTER><B>"IVY ETCHED BRACERS"</B></CENTER></H3><BR>

This quest is probably the easiest of the ivy armor quests and I had very little difficulty obtaining the items at level 27 with a fellow Ranger of the same level. This quest also holds true to my first paragraph of the ivy tunic quest so you might want to go back and read that part.<BR><BR>The first thing I had to do was get a "Watery Ring" off a tidal lord in Dagnor's Cauldron. There is a camp of tidal lord's just to the right of the zone near the waters edge. This is one of those places that is camped occasionally and if you don't want to wait to get possession of the camp just ask if you can get the ring when it drops. The tidal lord is a little bit tough at 26 but we did manage to kill him and get the ring while I was being beat on by his fellow cohorts and just before I was killed.<BR><BR>We then headed to Everfrost to the icy orc camp to get the "rune of ivy" off of a named orc, Redwind. He is also well camped and you can again ask to get the rune from the camp and this is where I got lucky and actually got in the group. He hits pretty hard and can cast fear so its really best to be in a good size group and/or be able to cast harmony on the icy orcs that surround him. He drops the rune most of the time but not all the time.<BR><BR>Last but not least, you need to purchase one fire emerald which can be bought from a vendor for about 85plat. I also bought this at the light blue building in North Freeport before entering the market place.<BR><BR>Once done, return to Kithicor Forest, hail Morin Shadowbane and ask her about the ivy etched bracer. Turn in the items and she'll give you one bracer which means you will have to do this quest once more to get the other one. You can't double up as you go the first time for the rune and ring are not only "no-drop" but also "lore" items, which means you can't have more than one in your possession at a time.<BR><BR>
