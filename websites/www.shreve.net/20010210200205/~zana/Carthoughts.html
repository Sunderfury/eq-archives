<B>These are my own personal views on some of the things I have encountered while playing, either alone or with others. I expect some of these views to change in due time and I also expect that some of the facts may not be correct...I have tried to sway from mentioning facts just stating opinions by mostly myself and from comments made to me by others while questing. I will continually correct any misconceptions I may have made as I discover more about the game. I realize that every char has their own way of playing the game. This is a good thing for it adds diversity. The balance is also weighed between good and evil. My thoughts here are my way of venting I guess...they are not meant to sway people from doing other than they do or to change the world to a plane of all goodness. I just thought I would mention this as you read into my venting..err thoughts. At the bottom of this page is my email address. I placed it here because I expect my thoughts might need enlightenment and you can surely critique anything I've said here.</B><BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="TRACKING"></A><IMG SRC="7rings/bar1flip.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="88" BORDER="0"></CENTER><BR><BR><BR><H3><CENTER>TRACKING</CENTER></H3><BR>

 Tracking is one of the greatest assets a Ranger has and they are asked frequently to go with groups who are just hunting certain type crits because of the Rangers ease in tracking them down.  I also find it a godsend when lost or just trying to find someone.  But there are some misconceptions to tracking which I thought I would mention perhaps to enlighten a few people.<BR><BR> 
       Though one can track for a very long distance, they cannot track the whole continent.  I have not delved into finding out precisely how far one can track or if exp levels expand the distance but I find that trivial to the fact that if you aren't on my tracking then you're just not and that's that.  When I pull up my tracking, there is a list of players or creatures to the left of my screen.  I am going to assume that the list is limited to a set number and lists the closest things to me within that set.  As I draw myself closer to you, you will eventually be picked up on my tracking list.<BR><BR>
      One of the greatest problems with tracking is hills and buildings.  We cannot track through these.  When you track something, you get these little messages saying they are to the right or left , straight ahead or behind you.  This continues as you move, eventually leading you in sight of the object. When near a hill, one can get a message saying it is straight ahead and to the left but when you turn a few steps to go that way it will quickly change to it is behind and to the right.  Eventually you feel as if you are turning in circles.  This can be very frustrating especially when you or your mate are in danger.  I guess I have not figured out yet how to get around these obstacles and I hope until I do that some people will have the patience to understand that tracking is not totally infallible.<BR><BR>  
     A few last words about tracking....if its not there, it can't be tracked...if you want a kodiak and there's none in the area of my tracking, I cannot conjure one up and make it be there. I can also not decipher if the objects are already being attacked by another, so if we run across the all of West commons to find something and it ends up already being taken by someone else, oh well....<BR><BR>
     I have researched a wee bit on this subject and find that many feel there is a cliche in the tracking which is causing some of the problems mentioned above..if not a cliche then something that needs to be corrected.  It is embarrassing to a Ranger to try to track something and have others see something but an arms length away from you that isn't on your tracking...or to start running half a zone away to have members say they found something and to come back...something is messed up with that for sure. Tracking is suppose to be one of the Rangers best abilities and it should be enhanced somehow within the game.  Better than nothing, I suppose, but none the less can be improved on. I don't really like having a griffin hovering over my head when I track and see my list filled with nothing but fire beetles.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="SENSE HEADING"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>SENSE HEADING</H3></CENTER><BR>Though I have heard and read that sense heading is a good thing that everyone gets as a skill, I find it a very difficult skill to raise. I suppose if you use it so often that it will read for you near each and every time that it could be quite beneficial in that you only need click on a button instead of digging in a pouch for your compass. I still find that even if it tells you what direction you are facing, if you aren't sure where you are going it isn't going to be of much help.  I will admit that I have used it on occasion when someone told me I needed to be heading in a certain direction. I expect if and when I should master this skill I may change my mind about it, but for now I rely on a compass, my surroundings and when I'm in an area where you can see the sky, I watch the clouds since the clouds move from the east to the west at all times.  I have also heard that if you drop a dagger it will always point to the north....(not sure how true this is).<BR><BR>Over a period of time I have learned how to use the "loc" system of finding one's way. I am still not real good at it yet but I think this is probably the fastest way to get from one place to another within a zone. Of course to use this you will either need some maps at hand with locations marked on them or as a lot of people do they shout asking for a location and most often will get a reply.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="FORAGING"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>FORAGING</H3></CENTER><BR>This is another valuable skill to a Ranger. I have mastered this skill and can basically rely on it solely for my food and drink. I also find it a fun thing to forage up berries and vegetables and sometimes offer these to my fellow adventurers for a nice change in their diet ;)  Many times I forage up fishing grub which allows me to fish without buying worms and therefore gives me a supply of fish food. A very cost efficient skill and I can see its value when travelling far from any merchants selling food and water.  I have also heard of people buying the berries and vegetables in order to make things for their crafts...mainly brewers and bakers. Some things require only foraged items so the forage skill becomes quite unique in that respect.<BR><BR>  
   If you wish to save up berries and veggies without eating them the best way to do this is place them in a backpack in the very bottom right slot and place the other foods ahead of them.  You will munch on the other foods first before hitting on the berries and veggies.  This will give you time to get them to the bank or to the person purchasing them from you.<BR><BR>
   I think a minor misconception about foraging, which I have encountered therefore even mentioning this, is that the skill does not look into your backpack and see what you have, then forage up that which you lack or are low on.  It's a random thing and if you are low on water you may forage up fish grub nine times out of ten.  I say this because I have been low on water and had someone tell me to forage some up.  I feel like they think me less of a Ranger if I cannot do so. Though my forage skill is mastered, I think this could still be a problem unless one just constantly hits that forage button at all times and keeps stocked up on food, grub and water.  Until then, if I need to run to the store, then so be it...<BR><BR>Having mastered this skill to 100 I find new things to forage now. Radishes, cherries, rathe berries, mushrooms, etc. What I find interesting is that these foraged items will sell to a vendor for at least a gold piece each. This can add up to some plat with just a few clicks of a button.  So if I find that I have plenty other food I will place these items in the lower right corner of my inventory and sell them.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="HEALING"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER><BR><CENTER><H3>HEALING</H3></CENTER><BR>

At my ninth level, I received the minor healing spell and at level 20 this spell increased some...A nice little thing but not really worth much in a life threatening situation.  Although I give it credit for healing someone as their poison runs its course or healing someone when they are near unconsiousness, it is not that great when someone is getting hit harder than I can heal them.  It should be remembered that this is a MINOR healing. It has helped in some dire situations but basically it helps to build up health a little quicker BETWEEN hunts and allows you or anyone else to be prepared with health in case something should come and attack you before you are totally healed and ready to hunt again. I believe it is pure luck if you can manage to keep someone alive with minor healing in some pretty nasty fights. If you think you're going to need some heavy healing while hunting I suggest you would expect a caster with greater healing power to do this for you and not a Ranger. <BR><BR>Along with healing of course is bandaging. This is something I tend to forget to use most often. The only benefit I can see of skilling in bandaging is that it doesn't use up your mana. I do not know if as your skill increases in bandaging that eventually you will heal faster than using the minor heal spell. You can only bandage a person to half their life and then you'll have to heal with spells the rest of the way. I don't know if this changes any as you increase your skill or not..I have yet to get past half way without the message saying that you can't bandage beyond this point. Perhaps one other nice thing about bandaging, for what it's worth, is that when you are in a place that isn't near a bank to unload a lot of coin that you carry, you can find a vendor and purchase a ton of bandages thus relieving yourself of some coin and run around bandaging everyone in sight and upping your skill level in it. You'll also undoubtly become the nice guy in the area ;)<BR><BR>I could be off base on this issue since my skill in bandaging is weak but I will certainly keep my eye on it and see what changes might occur as I gain skill in it. If it seems to make a difference I will mend this thought.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="PORTS"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>PORTS/BUFFS</H3></CENTER><BR>If you have not gotten the drift yet by reading some of my stories, I venture quite a bit. One day I may be in Halas, the next day I may be on the other side of the world in Kelethin. Some quests require you to go places...sometimes I just venture off with friends to help with something or sometimes just to explore new places.<BR><BR>Teleportation is a good thing...it saves time and undoubtedly takes away the boredom of perhaps sitting on a boat or running through long zones. My problem is that I think those who can teleport rip people off.  Many charge ten plat a person and can take up to 5 people on one trip.  Come on, folks...that's 50 plat! And what is it costing the person to do this? They have to sit and meditate for perhaps 5 or 10 minutes longer than usual is all. I can perhaps understand a reasonably large donation if someone is seeking a teleport and one is going out of their way to assist them. But many a time its an auction, drawing people who might want to go somewhere and they have the time to take them. I think the worst scenario is when a teleporter is heading to someplace anyway and still charges people who might want to go along for the ride. I can't teleport so perhaps I can't see their reason for doing this but I can more than suspect that they are wearing some really nice armor and jewelry...boughten of course.<BR><BR>On this same note are spell casters...buffers...I must admit that the majority of people I encounter will give you binds, sows,cures or clarity at no cost or perhaps a small donation you might feel generous enough to give. But there are those out there that auction these buffs for a price. I have seen people sitting on a dock in the Oasis, doing absolutely nothing but taking money from people who have become diseased and need a cure...shouting throughout the zone that they will do this for a price. I guess I expect that as long as people carry a purse of coin with them and pay for this stuff that it will continue to happen.
I think about the only thing that I have willingly paid for as a requirement to getting it, is a bind. A very vital thing when traveling about and planning to hunt in an area. With no other recourse one must pay the thieves. I do donate a good amount to any generous enough to give me a sow without a catch but I refuse to pay as a demand..I would walk across Norrath iffen I have to.<BR><BR>Alright, as you can see this is one of my vents. It's surely a means of making some money, which we'd all like to do but the things I am talking about here are not of any cost to the caster than perhaps some meditating and I just think it's a rip off is all....end of subject <BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="ENCUMBER"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>ENCUMBRANCE</H3></CENTER><BR>


Encumbrance seems to be a world wide burden ;) Near everyone I know at some point in time has to deal with it. Through some research and shared advice I have learned to relieve myself of a great part of Encumbrance that haunted me all the time a while back. Therefore I wish to share some of these ideas with you..<BR><BR>For starters, I expect you should take a look at yourself. Look at your armor and inventory of backpacks. As a Ranger my strength status is not real high to be able to carry a great load around with me. I started out buying chain mail for it was obviously cool looking and did add greater protection but I learned that banded was much better for me not only in protection but most of it weighed a lot less. So I sold all my chainmail and purchased banded armor. I took some what of a loss so I suggest you take a look at what armor you are purchasing as for as weight goes and check to see what is out there that might be better and lighter. You'll be surprised to what you may find and in the end save yourself some coin.<BR><BR>Another thing that one constantly needs to carry are backpacks. I found that I had a whole inventory full of backpacks but couldn't use a few of them because my encumbrance in perhaps filling one didn't allow me to add more until I sold what I had. Therefore it occurred to me that I didn't need all of them. I placed some of them in the bank for storage. I carry a fletching kit with me at all times for I never know when I'm going to have to go make arrows. The kit will hold a lot of items as well as a backpack. So it serves that purpose as well. I just say be cautious with using kits for if you accidently hit that combine button anything you have in them will poof. I usually try to place things that I'm not gonna cry over if I should happen to poof them in this kit.<BR><BR>This was a cool idea that someone shared with me and all others that I have passed this on to also think its a great idea. When you are especially burdoned with coin in an area that has no bank near by, go to a vendor and buy all the iron rations you can with the silver and copper you have on you. Then sell all the iron rations back to the vendor and he will pay you with gold coins. You will lose some coin in this transaction but all in all you will be carrying alot less coin and you will notice your encumbrance ratio drop considerably.  I have also mentioned buying bandages in my healing section on this page and I have heard that some buy stackable gems that they have some use for.<BR><BR>I have heard about "bankers" in areas like Lake Rathe and South Karana. What they do is offer to change your coin for you. They will give you platinum for your gold and perhaps gold for your silver and copper. They will charge you a fee to do so and since I have never used this service I am not going to comment on whether this might be another rip off or not. All I can say about it is don't give someone your money with the thought that they will go to the bank and change it for you there. Make the exchange in trade then and there. You may never see this person again and that's alot of coin to just hand over in total trust to perhaps a complete stranger.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="FLETCH"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>FLETCHING</H3></CENTER><BR>I have some thoughts on fletching that I think I will include on my fletching page. There is one issue about it though that I thought this was as good a place as any to vent it. <BR><BR>As a newbie Ranger I went to see my mentor Maelyn Trueshot who not only gave me some nice things to start out with but also gave me my first quest. Aye, that being the trueshot longbow quest. Of course, being new I did not realize that upon finishing this quest, the best I got was a stave to make the bow with. I asked him how to make the bow and he told me that once I have mastered the art of fletching that I would be able to make the bow with some other components that he listed. Well, I achieved the status of master in the fletching skill and tried my hand at making the bow. I failed. I then worked my way up to 123 in fletching and during this time tried my hand at making the bow 4 more times and failed. Now, he said that when I become a master fletcher that I could make the bow. My skill level reveals that I have mastered fletching yet I still cannot make the bow. I have also read that many people did not succeed in making the bow until skill 165 or better in fletching. My point is...why say you are a master in fletching, have your mentor say you can make the bow when mastered in fletching yet you have to go like way beyond that to even conceivably make the bow unless pure luck happens to come your way? A very frustrating endeavor of mine....arggggg....end of venting.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="TWINK"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H3>TWINKS</H3></CENTER><BR>

A long time ago it seemed that twinking was a big issue. Now if you don't know what that is it's basically when a person starts a second low level char and equips it with high level armor and weapons, etc.  Some people even cringe when new people are given "gifts" of relatively much higher levels than they should be wearing. The theory behind this is, from what I have read anyway, is that its a cheat and sort of takes away from the ambiance of the game or something.<BR><BR>I personally find nothing wrong with a person who has already delved into the playing of the game to want to start a new char and eliminate some of the slowness and tedium of achieving levels by strengthening their new char up front. I feel that everyone plays the game the way they want and a "twink" isn't affecting my game in any way shape or form...well, sort of...there is one issue that I don't like about it.<BR><BR>Perhaps the best way to approach this subject is to explain how some things make me feel....so I shall start with the Trueshot Longbow. This bow is sellable...you can actually buy one from a player for quite a high price. This bow is also a Ranger only quest. It's not really a difficult quest but is time consuming and the worst part is that one has to tend to their fletching and get it high enough to make the bow.  I have been working on this quest since my 5th season and at 29th I have yet to hold it in my hand. Now...I have friends who have the bow and never fletched a day in their lives.  This is all cool....but I swear iffen when I do make this bow and someone asks me how much I paid for it, I'm gonna bop them really hard over the head with it. Somehow the ability to buy the bow takes away something from me in achieving the goal to make it....get the drift?  No one is gonna say, "Wow, you made the Trueshot?"...Noooo, they are gonna ask me how much I paid for it.<BR><BR>I think this also holds true with some of the armor quests. To get the armor you have to actually be at places to get the "no drop" items yet the end result is a class only piece of armor that you can sell to Jack on the street! So somehow when I don my ivy armor I'm not going to feel so special about it.<BR><BR>I don't fault people who want to sell this kind of stuff...the game makes them able to do so and heh, everyone wants to make some good coin. Neither do I fault people who buy this stuff...its tempting...eliminates the wait..and if you can afford it, well? I just feel that these kinds of things do affect my char...because I can't relish the fact that I actually got this through a quest and that it has some meaning to my char.<BR><BR>That's really all I have to say on this subject...I do want to emphasis that I am speaking of "quest" items only...not hunted or camped items. After all, there has to be a market for something out there.<BR><BR><BR>
