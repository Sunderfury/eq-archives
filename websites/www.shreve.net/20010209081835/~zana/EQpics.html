Greetings and welcome to our gallery of screenshots from the game Everquest.  Click the active links in the text below to view pictures.  When pictures are mentioned but there is no active link it is because we've not yet created a place for them in the gallery but they will be coming soon.  I decided to do this this way for now because of the small selection of pictures we have at present.  As this gallery becomes more extensive the format may change.<BR><BR>
There are some shots of <A HREF="Dervhunt.html">derv hunts</A> in the West Commons and Desert of Ro; a really good set of pictures of a <A HREF="griffdeth.html">fight</A> between a 50th level spell caster of some sort and a griffin near the derv camp in West Commons; scenes from places around Norrath such as <A HREF="Neriak.html">Neriak</A>, West and East Commons, Surefall Glade and the pier in East Freeport and some just plain <A HREF="Strange.html">strange ones</A>.  The pictures from Surefall Glade were taken by my rambling wife who began life in Kelethin and has now been all the way to Qeynos in her travels...she may end up in Erudin soon... who knows?  The ones from Neriak were taken by my own evil self and may be of interest to those of you whom our guards dislike.<BR><BR>
We hope you enjoy these pictures and if you don't already play the game we hope they make you decide to give it a shot.  I'm sure anyone who's been eaten by the griffin will like the ones of the griffin's death and some of the others may be interesting if they are from places you can't get to right now. <BR><BR><HR SIZE="5"><BR><BR>
