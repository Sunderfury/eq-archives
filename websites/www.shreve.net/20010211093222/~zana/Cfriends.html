I have many more pictures to add but I'll need to run around the all of Norrath to get them. My hope is to grab some shots of my friends and have a small interview with them. As I do so, they will be added so make sure to check out the bottom little arrows for next pages. I also will be adding pictures of my friends who aren't in the guild but good friends to me nonetheless.<BR><BR>
