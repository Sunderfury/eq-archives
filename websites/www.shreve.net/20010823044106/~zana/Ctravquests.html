<B>These are Quests that have been completed by members of the Wayward Travelers. There is a short description of what you need to do to complete the quest and below each is a link to the actual telling of how they accomplished the quest and the ventures they faced while doing so. The stories are not only entertaining but also go more into detail of what you, yourself might face should you decide to do the quest.</B><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H3><B>"Testament of Vanear"</B></H3></CENTER>
<CENTER>{Magic - Lore - No Drop}</CENTER>
<CENTER>{Wis +10 - Mana +10}</CENTER>
<CENTER>{Classes and Races: All}</CENTER><BR>

<B>This quest is a very long and arduous one. What you have to do is find Moodoro in Qeynos, give him 2 gold pieces and he will give you the testament of vanear container. After this, you give Moodora 4 gold pieces until he gives you a joker card which you will then give back to him for a page of the testament. The next part of the quest is to find and kill Guard Dyllin. He is a 6-8 hour spawn in Highpass Hold. After you kill him, you get the second page. Place both pages in the container and hit combine....you end up with the testament. </B><BR><BR>

<H3><CENTER><B>"Ivy Etched Bracers"</B></CENTER></H3>
<CENTER>{AC 9 - Dex +2 - SV Poison +3}</CENTER>
<CENTER>{Ranger only}</CENTER>
<CENTER>{Race: Human, Elf, HElf}</CENTER><BR>
<B>What many Rangers seek as their first true quests are the ivy etched armor. The bracers are by far the easiest to get with some assistance at about level 27. To do the quest you have to go to Everfrost and find the icy orc camp where Redwind resides. You will need the ivy rune off his corpse. Next you will have to go to Dagnor's Cauldron and find the Goblin Tidal Lord camp. From his corpse you will get the water ring needed. You will now have to purchase a fire emerald {approximately 90pp} which you can find at a vendor in Freeport at the blue building right near the entrance to the North Freeport market. With these three items in hand you will go to Kithicor forest, locate Morin Shadowbane at the Ranger camp and ask her about the bracers. She will ask for these items and in return you will get a bracer. You will only receive one bracer and since these items are mostly lore, you will have to repeat the quest to get the other one. </B><BR><BR>

<B><CENTER><H3>"Trueshot Longbow"</H3></CENTER></B>
<CENTER>{Lore, Damage 20, Range 100, Delay 45}</CENTER>
<CENTER>{Ranger only}</CENTER>
<CENTER>{Race: Hum, Elf, HElf}</CENTER><BR><BR>
<B>This quest is a wee bit deceiving {unless you can read between the fine lines of what Maesyn originally tells you} for you have to actually fletch the bow yourself with a stave you are given from the doing of the quest itself. Sooo...to get the stave:<BR><BR>
Hail Maesyn Trueshot {found in Kelethin at the Faydark's Champion Ranger guild} , repeat the clues in brackets and in the end he will give you a bag and tell you what is needed:<BR><BR>
<CENTER>Dwarven wire - from Trantor Everhot in Kaladim (side quest here)</CENTER>
<CENTER>Treant wood - from Jyle Windshot in West Freeport {another little side quest here}</CENTER>
<CENTER>Spiderling silk - can get in East Commons or Steamfont Mountains</CENTER>
<CENTER>Micro Servo - from rogue spiders in Steamfont Mountains</CENTER>
<BR>Place these four items in the pack that Maesyn gave you and combine. Give the pack back to Maesyn and he will in turn give you a stave.<BR><BR>
To make the bow itself you can hail Maesyn once again and ask of the bow and he will tell you what is needed in order to fletch it in your kit. The components to fletch the bow are:<BR><BR>
<CENTER>The stave Maesyn gave you </CENTER> 
<CENTER>Dwarven wire - same as the quest for getting the stave</CENTER>
<CENTER>Micro servo - again, the same as the quest for getting the stave
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Planing tool - bought at a vendor of bow components</CENTER><BR> 
<I>{If you fail at fletching the bow you will not lose the planing tool but you will lose all the rest...this means you will have to do the guest over again to get the stave from Maesyn, the wire and micro servo.}</I><BR><BR>Though some have said that they have managed to make the bow at as low an experiance level in fletching of 80, I advice you at least master this trade first. You can also save some time by doubling up on dwarven wire and micro servos as you do those parts of the quests for the stave and the bow. I did that in later years when I learned the quest well through my failures.
