<B>The stories here are of my adventures thus far.  Most of them are really from my early seasons when I was young and not familiar with what I was doing. Yet I find that I still continue to run into a wee bit of trouble now and then. I hope you will find them humorous for though at the time of the events they did not seem so, when I look back I can smile and say, "Aye, that's what happened alright."

<BR><CENTER><H2><A NAME="nuts"></A>"GOING NUTS"</H2></CENTER><BR>
I started out my adventure heading to the city of Felwithe. On my way, I came across a place called the <A HREF="Xanapics/RuneStones.jpg">Runestones</A>. This to me is the pinnacle of the Faydwer continent. From here you can find your way to near every place on the continent and makes for a great landmark when lost or journeying. And it is from here that I continued on my way to Felwithe.  <A HREF="Xanapics/Felwithe2.jpg">Felwithe</A> is the home of the High Elves and is a beautiful city with its flowering vines and marble walls. In this city is where I had my first experience in learning how to swim and fish.<BR><BR>
     Heading west from Felwithe I encountered the city of <A HREF="Xanapics/Kaladim1.jpg">Kaladim</A> - The Dwarven City within the boundaries of ButcherBlock Mountains. Since being here, I decided to start on my first real quest, that being the trueshot longbow quest given to me by my trainer in Kelethin. The biggest problem I had with this quest was that at some point I was to give Trippy some kiola nuts and water to make me some tonics.  The kiola nuts were found on what is called Sister Island.  Now unless you have the transport spell or can get someone to transport you, the only means for you to get from one continent to another is via the <A HREF="Xanapics/boat2.jpg">boat</A>.  The pier to catch the boat on the Faydwer continent is just west of Kaladim.  As my luck would have it, the boat was approaching the dock upon my arrival and I had to make a mad dash for the pier to catch it or have a long wait for the next.  I ran as fast as I could up the pier, reached the boat and thinking it was docked, I tried to jump on it and landed in the drink...terrifying!!!  Being a very poor swimmer and thinking I was perhaps under the boat I could only imagine that this was my final demise with no chance of ever being able to recover my body.  My only recourse was to at least try to do something...so I turned to try and reach water level when I saw this hole in the boat...I headed to it and lo and behold I surfaced on a ramp in the bottom of the boat, walked up it and there I was..on the boat!  Now I don't recommend this as a means of getting on the boat and I am now a wee bit more cautious when it comes to getting on and off boats.<BR><BR>
     As I sat on the boat, getting my heart back to a normal rhythm once again, I kept watch for the docking at <A HREF="Xanapics/SisIsle1.jpg">Sister Island</A>.  Upon arriving there I asked where to purchase the kiola nuts and found it conveniently a few steps away from the dock.  I went in to purchase the nuts and found that I did not have enough coin with me.  I had to return to the dock, sit and wait for the next boat to come, return back to Kaladim and find the bank there.  Once again I ventured forth to achieve this task of getting the nuts, waiting for the boat and going to Sister Island.  Having finally purchased the nuts I waited for the boat {sighs} and went back to Kaladim once again.  I found Trippy and gave him the kiola nuts.  He said I lacked two items....the water.  I reached in my pack to retrieve the water and guess what?  NOOOO water!!!  I only had milk in my pouch for people said it was much cheaper.  Disgruntled, I had to leave Trippy with the nuts and find water.  I searched high and low thru out Kaladim and could not find anyone selling water.  I ran back to the dock where I knew a merchant had water and purchased several.  Returning once again to Trippy in Kaladim, I gave him the water but he did not seem to remember at this point that I had given him the nuts awhile back.  YES!!! I had to get back on the boat, go to Sister Island, purchase the nuts, wait for the boat and return to Kaladim!!<BR><BR>
And YES!!!! I finally completed this small but quite lengthy part of the quest.  Btw....I finally finished the quest and got me a treant stave that I have to make my own bow with once I get skilled enough in fletching to do so. I wonder if I will somehow lose it before then....<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="which way"></A>"WHICH WAY?"</H2></CENTER><BR>

      I have a very dear friend whom I have known for many years playing these games.  His name is Sir Robin.  He has assisted me and taught me many of the things I needed to know about Everquest.  One thing I will admit is that I am very bad with direction and even worse with being aware of my surroundings...not a good thing for a Ranger who is suppose to know the terrain and be able to help travellers find their way.  I am learning to overcome this.  Anyway,  on one occasion when Robin and I were traveling together he wanted me to lead the way since he had instructed me previously on our where abouts.  I started going in the wrong direction and he informed me kindly of this.  I turned around a few times to take in our surroundings and preceded to head in the same wrong direction.  He was a little more blunt in telling me so and I stopped.  Looking again and thinking, I did the very same thing once again....he became a wee bit enraged and started asking me how I could find my way to the store?  How I could go visit my parents?  During all this I noded and upon my return heard Robin shouting to the world about how someone could keep going in the wrong direction three times in a row!!!  Hehehe.....{raises hand}. He saw me, said "That's it!", cast a spell, and transported me to the rune stones which was closest to Kelethin, our destination at that time.  He told me I was on my own, turned me into the direction I was to go and off  I went to reach my home town of Kelethin.
I guess I couldn't blame him for his frustration and looking back I can now see the humor in the event (I hope he can, too)....Robin did return to me and took the time and patience to explain to me the entire path from Kelethin to Kaladim.  To this day, it is remembered ;)<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="qeynos"></A>"QUEST TO QEYNOS"</H2></CENTER><BR>
   I think one of my most memorable trips thus far is the trip Robin and I took one night to <A HREF="Xanapics/Qeynos1.jpg">Qeynos</A>.  We were hunting in East commons outside of Freeport and were bored.  Robin had some quests to do in Qeynos and asked me to go along informing me that it would be about a two hour real time run.  We went to Freeport and stocked up on food and water, got a spirit of the wolf spell placed on us so we could run faster and headed out. <BR><BR> I followed Robin closely the whole way but still managed to get lost on a couple of occasions.  It was a very terrifying thing for I was in some very strange lands and very far from Freeport where I was bound if I should die.  We ran thru many zones, some I don't remember.  I remember High Pass for it was one of those places way up in the mountains and my fear of falling off a cliff stayed with me thru this whole part of it.  We managed to get to Qeynos with hardly any problems actually and called it a night once we were safe and bound there.<BR><BR>  I did not see Robin during that week so I explored the city of Qeynos and ventured outside the city looking for things to hunt to get exp.  Finding nothing that my level could kill for experience I followed a path outside of Qeynos that took me to Surefall Glade.  <A HREF="EQimages/Waterfall.jpg">Surefall Glade</A>, in my opinion, is Ranger and Druid heaven.  There are more Ranger Guild masters and  fletching shops than in all of Kelethin, my home town.  It is a beautiful little place with a huge waterfall and many gigantic trees hovering over little shops.  The only thing is, I could still not find a place to hunt and get experience.  By week's end Robin had returned and showed me where to go hunt. It was like a mine place in Surefall Glade with gnolls that seem to group in packs.  I actually died more often during these hunts than gaining experience and after a night of this it was decided that I was not ready yet for this kind of hunting at my level.  We were to return to Freeport. <BR><BR> Once again we loaded up on food and water, got a sow and took off.  We were not so fortunate this time and ran into a bunch of gnolls near Highpass.  We were both killed and ended up back in Qeynos with our bodies hours away.  I was dismayed thinking that it would be impossible to recover our bodies since the area they were at was thriving with gnolls.  Robin thought otherwise and got us to the zone where our bodies were.  He made me wait outside the zone and practice my foraging as he entered the zone and was going to loot our bodies.  Eventually, after much fretting and foraging on my part, he returned not only with my things but with a friend he had made who helped us get to HighPass and bind us there...just in case.  Now in HighPass, there are cells for prisoners.  The experience gotten here was to get the prisoners out of the cells and kill them.  Was easy enough for they would escape from the cells upon noticing us.  Unfortunately, the guards in the area would not help us in the killing and we were basically on our own and many of the prisoners were beyond my capability of killing on my own.  It was getting into the wee hours of the morning and Robin and I were both tired.  He found me a relatively safe place to camp in this place...behind a guard (who won't help if a prisoner should decide to beat on me)..and we decided to meet later in the day to finish our trek back to Freeport.  We did and arrived safely....  I promised myself to return to Surefall Glades and have done so several times.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="sewers"></A>"SEWERS STINK!"</H2></CENTER><BR>

As you may have noticed by now, especially the story "Which Way?" I have a tendency to get lost.  Don't know why, I just do.  This story seemed to set a precedence with the Wayward Travelers and it seems to date that we have noted ourselves as getting lost {g}...<BR><BR>

It was my first meeting ever since I had joined the Wayward Travelers Guild. The meeting was to be held in Freeport in the area called "the sewers". Now I knew not where this place was though I was quite familiar with the town of Freeport. A dear friend of mine, Kilween, prior to the day of the meeting took me down there to check it out. There is a secret wall outside the West Gate of Freeport that you just run into and you will enter this underground area. We found a nice place to have the meeting and later mentioned it to our leader.<BR><BR>Near the scheduled time of the meeting everyone was gathering at the west gate and I had decided to run down to the sewers to take a look again. But it seems instead of going to the intended wall on the right side of the West Gate, I managed to find another on the left side. I ventured around and could not seem to find the spot we had chosen nor could I find the exit back out. Ummm...I was lost.<BR><BR> I asked for some assistance by announcing I was lost in the sewers and many started running around the sewers looking for me but no one could seem to find me. I think they went in the other secret door way. Some were shouting as to how I could be lost when the sewers were not that big an area {shrugs}.Finally one member name of Bispus asked me to do a tracking and tell him what was on it. I did so and gave him some names that came up. He yelled out that I was under the Hogcallers Inn! He came to get me and escorted me out. My embarrassment was beyond redness I think as many laughed about this episode and the meeting had to start later because they had to rescue me first. I have never gone into the sewers by myself again.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"HELLO NERIAK!!"<A NAME="neriak"></A></H2></CENTER><BR>

I have been hunting around of late with our fearless leader of the Wayward Travelers, Deureger. One evening after a meeting in Freeport, not at the sewers either, hehe, he asked me if I would like to go to Lavastorm with him to look around. I informed him that I had never been there before and he sort of admitted that neither had he but he thought he had a basic idea of where it might be.<BR><BR>Now the one thing I don't like about this whole game is when I have to run through Nektulos Forest. First of all, it is a very dark place..probably so because it is filled with dark elf people and guards who are totally antagonistic about us white folk, especially from what I understand, wood elves..like myself.  Therefore I have a justified fear of entering this zone. And secondly because we could not go through it invisible if we wished to follow each other.<BR><BR>Deuregar seemed unafraid and told me to just follow him and to stay very close together. He entered the zone first to make sure there were no guards standing around and informed me all was clear. We proceeded to follow very close to the zone wall to the right of us and came to a river that we had to cross. My fear was growing by the minute for I had heard there were piranha in this river. We made it safely across and I continued to follow Deur as he hugged the wall.<BR><BR>After a wee bit of a trek we came to this opening in the side of the wall and seeing as Deuregar ran into this place I followed him thinking this must be the zone to Lavastorm. Feeling relieved as I was zoning that we had made it safely, when the zone area came up it read "Foreign Quarter". We were in the frigging city of Neriak!!! I had a chance to take a quick look but hardly a breath when I heard someone shout, "Heh, Look!! A woodelf!!" and then I got smacked atop the head by a guard. I quickly backed up into the previous zone and found Deuregar sitting on the ground meditating. He swiftly healed me for I was near dead and then just as swiftly apologized for this error. I was undoubtedly terrified and quickly cast invisibility on myself as I waited to hear what we do now. It was decided that we would give up this quest for the time being until we could get us some good maps and we would head back to South Karana instead. I wholeheartedly agreed yet I noticed Deuregar just kept sitting there medding. My thought was this must be a pretty safe place where we stood because he seemed so fearless. <BR><BR>A very short time later a guard came up and started beating on Deuregar! Deur told me to run and I high tailed it out of there trying to recall the direction we had come from. Unfortunately but expectedly, Deuregar lost his life. In the by and by I was trying to follow the zone wall back and I felt like I was getting lost. Eventually I came to the river, crossed it back and shortly there after saw the path out of the zone. I had made it out alive!<BR><BR>Poor naked Deur came running back over to the zone and was going back to retrieve his body. I cast a camoflage on him and he took off as I crossed my fingers and hoped the camo held for him the whole way. I waited and waited and he finally told me he had recovered his body and then gated out. I was totally elated to this news and met him for our journey back to South Karana. I did shout to the guild that Deuregar was a true Wayward! To the bone!<BR><BR><BR>
