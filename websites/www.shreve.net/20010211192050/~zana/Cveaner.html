While walking from Qeynos to Freeport on a journey toward the Temple of Solusek Ro, I came upon a little mountainside town called Highpass Hold, something about the town reached into my mind, but I could not quite recall what it was.  Upon entering the zone, I was immediately greeted by a handful of gnolls who wanted to invite me to dinner, or rather, who wanted to make me dinner.  After recovering from their fetid breath and hideous faces, I decided that it would not do well for me to join them that night.  Thus, I called upon the forces of Mithaniel Marr and created a great rumbling of the earth several times.  As the earth reached up to swallow these beasts, I quickly thanked my almighty and went on my way. <BR><BR> 

As I continued wandering through this town, I suddenly remembered that there was once a story told to me by my old minister. "Aeons ago, our bretheren held a mystical book called the Testament of Vanear. It was a great book, filled with much knowledge and ancient scriptures."<BR>
"What happened to it?" I asked.<BR>
"During the War of the Shadows, orcs led by Innoruuk himself invaded our church and burned it to the ground.  Legends say that the book survived.  However, in the hands of orcs, it is unlikely."<BR>
After a moment of silence, "I see" I said solemnly<BR><BR>

In my younger days, I slayed orcs with a vengeance, each one I interrogated about the book, but only when I was alone since I did not want such knowledge to fall to evil hands.  Most orcs, however, were not helpful, they just begged and pleaded for their lives until I just grow tired of them and bash their skulls in. There was one incident where an orc cursed me and promised me that their Emperor, Emperor Crush, would avenge their deaths.<BR><BR>  

After searching the text repository for indications of this Emperor Crush, I found out that he lives in Crushbone.  So, taking the boat, I decided to "meet" this Emperor.  Luckily enough, I found a band of hardy adventurers which were out for the blood of Emperor Crush.  I made a pact with them that I would heal their wounds on the condition that I get to interrogate Emperor Crush before he was destroyed. <BR><BR> 

Dead bodies of previous adventurers littered the hallways of the castle.  As fate would have it, those adventurers had cleared a way straight to the throne room.  While it still held the grandeur of a royal court, it stank of unwashed orc bodies and was littered with feces and decaying corpses.  After the initial wave of nausea passed, I came face to face with the biggest, baddest orc of Norrath.<BR><BR>  

With huge, muscular, green arms, and blood-soaked teeth, it was a sight to behold!  Emperor Crush, ruler of the orcs indeed deserved his post.  I could not imagine any number of orcs being able to take him on.  To his left was a human delegate whose seedy appearance gave him away to be some sort of smuggler.  My party immediately got to work on Emperor Crush, I stayed in the back and offered some divine energies to heal my party’s wounds.  In the midst of battle, the delegate vanished! <BR><BR> 

Unfortunately, the fight wasn’t going so well, the Emperor’s loud shouts called reinforcements from the recesses of the castle.  We were surrounded by orcs! Suddenly, as we were all about to get slaughtered, we heard sounds of battle coming from outside.  With that unexpected surprise, our valiant warrior plunged his mighty axe into the Emperor’s hide.  Green blood oozed from his body.  I applied a small bandage to him, enough to keep him alive, but not enough to have him run.  When the orcs saw what we did, they broke, one by one.  Being a coward at heart, orcs tend to run when they are in a less than winning fight.  My party had a jolly time slaying the fleeing corpses.<BR><BR>  

While this was happening, I quickly interrogated the Emperor about the Testament of Venear.  At first, he was very stubborn and protested that he did not know where the book was.  I knew he was lying, and using the other side of healing, I convinced him to tell me its location.  It seems that the smuggler who was just there had the Testament, he was to give it to a Guard Dyllin in Highpass Hold.  After extracting this information, I slayed the Emperor lest he reveal his secrets to others.<BR><BR>

After months of wandering, I had finally found Highpass Hold.  I realized that my revelry took a long time and it was now approaching dusk.  I decided to find a good inn where I can bed down and write a letter to my lovely Carista. <BR><BR> 
 
As I was writing, lo and behold, a messenger bird appeared!  It carried a note from Carista.  I was overjoyed!  She expressed that while she could not accompany me physically, she was with me in spirit.  Her divine presence gave me a surge of strength and I decided to find Guard Dyllin at that moment.  As I arrived at the smuggler’s hideaway, I saw Guard Dyllin run off, I remained hidden lest he not come back at a later date.<BR><BR>  

Six hours came and went, Carista’s spiritual presence helped me survive it all.  I practiced my divination for a long time, and almost mastered it.  Finally, I saw Guard Dyllin.  Being a cleric of the 37th season, I easily handled him.  Yet, when I was about to slay him, a group of crows surrounded me and blinded me for the moment.  That one moment proved to be my downfall, for Guard Dyllin escaped.  However, he did drop a copy of half the book.<BR><BR>  

I was frustrated!  I only had half of the book, apparently, the orcs tore it in half.  I “interrogated” some of the smugglers, and they revealed to me that Moodoro had the other half, when I asked them where Moodoro was, they pointed me toward Qeynos.<BR><BR>

Thus, I grabbed my gear and set off for Qeynos. After a few days, I arrived there.  Tired, I decided to rest at the first inn before I try to find Moodoro.  Upon entering the inn, I saw, to my great luck, there was Moodoro.  He was sitting there playing cards with the locals.  I sat down in front of him, and I quietly asked him about the Testament.<BR><BR>  

“Ah, you’re after the Testament” Moodoro said, “I’ll tell you what, if you pick the joker out of this deck, I will give you the other half of the Testament. It costs 2 gold pieces per try”<BR>
 
“Ok, I shall play your game.” I said, reaching into my pocket.<BR>

The game proved to be tough, I kept picking kings, queens, and beggars, but never the joker.  I feared I would go broke and thus would be unable to support Carista and I.  Finally, I picked the joker!  I quickly gave it back to him, and he gave me the Testament part.<BR><BR>   

Now I had a problem, I didn’t have book bindings.  Moodoro saw my problem and told me that he could sell me the original binding for 2 gp.  I gave it to him. I combined both pages in the container, I waited for a moment, and when I looked at the container again, the pages were gone! <BR><BR> 

I quickly stormed up to the nearest temple where I prayed for answers.  A few minutes later, inside the Temple of Life, a figure stepped out of the light, and told me that both Moodoro and Guard Dyllin still had the real pieces of the Testament.  I was duped!<BR><BR>

After working off some steam, I decided to get the real pieces back. I quickly confronted Moodoro, and after some cajoling, I finally took the real page from him.  I also took the real bindings of the book.  I went to Highhold Pass once again to see if Guard Dyllin was to be found.  Unfortunately, when I got there, the smugglers informed me that the Guard had just left after collecting is quarterdaily bribe (4 times a day). <BR><BR> 

I decided to wait for him to come again.  Luckily, Carista was still sending me messenger birds, and so was Beladonaa. With both their help I managed to keep myself quite busy until the 6 hour time limit had passed.  The Guard didn’t show!  The smugglers were rejoicing, they were speculating that the Guard had died!  I was mortified.  I figured he was late and decided to wait for him awhile.  An hour passed, and still no sight of him.  By this time, the messenger birds have stopper arriving.  My lids were getting heavy from lack of sleep. My knees were trembling.  I was on the verge of packing up the camp and going to the inn, when suddenly, the place grew eerily quiet. <BR><BR>

The smugglers had seen Guard Dyllin coming.  I quickly hid behind a crate lest he see me and run away.  When he was truly inside. I casted smite on him.  In seconds it was over, Guard Dyllin was caught by surprise, and even his crows couldn’t help him.  I gagged and tied him up after taking what I wanted as well as a Bayle List.  I once again sat down, made a little player to Mithanel Marr, thought about Carista, and combined both pages.<BR><BR>  

The skies began to darken.  I thought it would rain again, but it didn’t.  A single white light came from the heavens and surrounded the book.  I saw it hover in the air and lift higher and higher.  As the book reached the clouds, the light darkened.  The Testament of Vanear fell from the sky.  At that moment, I saw a red dragon swoop down and try to catch it, but it failed.  The book fell into my arms.<BR><BR>

I opened the pages and read it.  “To the bearer of this book comes the power of Mithanel Marr. Use it wisely and do not let it fall into evil hands.”<BR>
A voice in my mind then said: “Deuregar, you have been chosen to keep the book, use it wisely and defeat evil in this land. Never let Nagafen get his hands on it for whoever hold this book in their hands has the power to heal or harm an individual with greater results. Keep it, until I come to collect it from you.”<BR><BR>

And that is how I got the Testament of Vanear.<BR><BR>
