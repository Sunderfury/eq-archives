     Greetings Lords, Ladies and Rogues and welcome to our home.  If you're the sort who likes to look at pictures of those who own the websites you visit, there is one of <A HREF="Graphics/Yoss_n_d.jpg">us</A> available.  As you can tell, if you looked at the picture above or if you read much further, we enjoy things medieval and an environment of fantasy.  Last year (98) we took some <A HREF="sfaire.html">pictures at Scarborough Faire</A> and have put them up for you to view if you wish. We have recently begun playing <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com">Everquest</A>, a fantasy rpg, and are spending most of our online time there.  Should you decide to visit us there you may look for us on the Cazic-Thule server where I play a character named <A HREF="Anbhas.html">Anbhas</A> who is a member of the  Keepers of the Balance guild.  Xana's main character, named <A HREF="Locsley.html">Carista</A>, is played on the Innoruuk server.  She has written of the adventures she had while travelling about Norrath and also put down some thoughts on various aspects of the game.  For those interested in seeing the game, we have been taking some screenshots while playing and some of these may be seen in our <A HREF="EQpics.html">Everquest Image Gallery</A>.  Check out our <A HREF="linkpage.html">links page</A> for more Everquest links.

When we're not roleplaying on-line we spend a lot of our time drinking wine and playing Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game in which you take the role of a wizard and try to blow away your opponent(s) by casting spells, summoning creatures etc.  If you're not greedy, this game can be inexpensive to play and is extremely portable and fun since the "boredom factor" is quite low.  However, if you're the type of person who goes nuts and has to have everything possible right away, it can become an expensive habit.
The game is put out by <A HREF="http://www.wizards.com">Wizards of the Coast, Inc.</A> and there are a great many sites on the web devoted to it.  One I recommend highly is <A HREF="http://www.mtg-club.com">Magic: The Internet Club</A>.  They have lots of resources, playing tips and general information about the game available and, best of all, joining up is free!  All you have to do is go there, pick a username and password and you're in.<BR><BR>
Well, this is all for now on our very-under-construction page.  As time passes, Xana will have a <A HREF="storyhead.htm">story page</A> up and Mardil will do some <A HREF="celtlink.html">Irish/Celtic</A> links.
