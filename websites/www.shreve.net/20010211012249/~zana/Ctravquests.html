<B>This quest is a very long and arduous one. What you have to do is find Moodoro in Qeynos, give him 2 gold pieces and he will give you the testament of vanear container. After this, you give Moodora 4 gold pieces until he gives you a joker card which you will then give back to him for a page of the testament. The next part of the quest is to find and kill Guard Dyllin. He is a 6-8 hour spawn in Highpass Hold. After you kill him, you get the second page. Place both pages in the container and hit combine....you end up with the testament. </B><BR><BR>

<H3><CENTER><B>"Ivy Etched Bracers"</B></CENTER></H3>
<CENTER>{AC 9 - Dex +2 - SV Poison +3}</CENTER>
<CENTER>{Ranger only}</CENTER>
<CENTER>{Race: Human, Elf, HElf}</CENTER><BR>
<B>What many Rangers seek as their first true quests are the ivy etched armor. The bracers are by far the easiest to get with some assistance at about level 27. To do the quest you have to go to Everfrost and find the icy orc camp where Redwind resides. You will need the ivy rune off his corpse. Next you will have to go to Dagnor's Cauldron and find the Goblin Tidal Lord camp. From his corpse you will get the water ring needed. You will now have to purchase a fire emerald {approximately 90pp} which you can find at a vendor in Freeport at the blue building right near the entrance to the North Freeport market. With these three items in hand you will go to Kithicor forest, locate Morin Shadowbane at the Ranger camp and ask her about the bracers. She will ask for these items and in return you will get a bracer. You will only receive one bracer and since these items are mostly lore, you will have to repeat the quest to get the other one. </B><BR><BR>
