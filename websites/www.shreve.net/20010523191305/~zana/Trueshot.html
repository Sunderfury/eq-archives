<CENTER><H2>The Trueshot Longbow</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>{by Carista Locsley}</CENTER><BR><BR>


This story is quite lengthy but the incidents that occurred did indeed happen and I wanted to include them in my memory of this quest. I decided to give more details to the doing of the quest itself on the main quest page for you might lose track of what to do if you follow this story and it would just add to the length of it. So this story is mainly for the enjoyment of just reading and not so much in detail about the quest...good God, this should happen to you in trying to do this quest! Enjoy!<BR><BR><BR>

   .....My name is Carista Locsley. My father was Robin of Locsley, better known as the infamous Robin Hood. He was a great archer, one of the best and as a small child I watched him practice time and again to first puncture a tree with an arrow and then split the first arrow in two with another. Some day I was to be like him. 
    He died through the course of my years and I wandered about aimlessly for sometime, his memory always instilled in the back of my mind. I loved him so.<BR><BR> 
    .....Through my wanderings I came across a new world called Norrath and found myself to first be in a place of this world called Kelethin. A smile came to my face as I looked up and saw that the city was in the trees, just as it was long ago in a place called home. Many a Ranger were mulling about, many a merchant selling wares and many a stranger offering assistance to many a stranger just arriving. Being strange to it myself I asked where I could get food and water. It did not take long for one to hold my hand and guide me to a vendor in the trees. "But I have no money, you see", I informed the helping hand. He looked me up and down some and I was beginning to feel a wee bit awkward when he finally stated, "I think Ye should see the one called Maesyn Trueshot. He is the Commander of Faydarks Champions and takes care of his own kind..Rangers ya know..such as you appear to be." I asked for just a few more minutes of his time to show me this place and he kindly led me farther up into the trees, crossing dangling bridges and steep ramps that had no sides. I feared I would fall and crept along quite slowly until we stopped before a small building. "This is the place and I will leave you here", he pronounced, "Just hail Maesyn inside and he will help you." I thanked the man for his kindness and entered the building with the sign reading "Faydark's Champions".<BR><BR>
      It was not very difficult to find the man Maesyn for he stood statured and dazzling in the back of the room casting some very impressive spells as his apprentices watched and learned. As I drew nearer I became in awe of the the most magnificent bow I had ever laid my eyes on! He gripped it tightly in his strong hands and it seemed to glow with each spell he cast. Though in fear of his seemingly greatness I approached him for I needed to know more about this bow. At first he treated me as if I were to become one his apprentices as well...he gave me a couple of nice little spells to practice with, showed me many skills that were available to me to start learning and generously handed me a tunic as well as some food and water. He then bid me a farewell and instructed me to practice and start learning the ways of a Ranger. I could not leave until I knew something of his bow so I hailed him once again. Apparantly he must have known what I was after for he informed me that the bow was the Trueshot Longbow before I even asked. I needed to know more so I asked him further, "But what of the Trueshot Longbow, pray tell?"<BR><BR>
     "The Trueshot Longbow was created by my father, Eldin Trueshot", he related. "It is quite accurate and takes a Rangers skill to wield. We use our new recruits to gather materials needed and we shall soon begin to release the formula to good elves so all may fletch such a bow."<BR><BR>
      I was ecstatic! This meant that I could possibly have such a bow! "I will gather materials", I told him quickly. He handed me a pack and proceeded to explain what I needed to do. "Go to Kaladim, find TrantorEverhot and ask for Dwarven wire. Then go to Freeport to meet Jyle Windshot. Search the inns for him and ask for treant wood. Then, collect some spiderling silk from spiderlings and finally, in Steamfont, we have the permission of the gnomes to use any micro servos we find while destroying rogue spiders. Combine them all and return the pack to me".<BR><BR>
     I left him after that and sat outside the building for a short while pondering how I shall ever get to this place called Kaladim. I was not skilled enough nor experienced enough to make such a journey without fear of being killed by lurking creatures along the way. "It is apparant I will not have this bow today", I resolved to myself. I therefore busied myself killing creatures below the city, gaining experience and learning the ways of a ranger. I also picked up a small hunting bow and purchased a fletching kit and started making my own arrows, bettering my skills in fletching with each new arrow made. In a short period of time I had reached my 5th season as a Ranger and returned to Maesyn for encouragement and more training. He gave me the ability to use some better spells to practice with so I purchased these spells and memorized them. One spell in particular was called camoflage. I found by using this spell I could be hidden from anyone around. This was my way to get to Kaladim!<BR><BR>
      I questioned many strangers about this city Kaladim and was directed to a path and told to just follow it east and it will take me to the gates of the city. I made myself invisible and proceeded on my journey. Now and then along the way I would run into a creature of the woods. "Hahaha! You can't see me!", I giggled with glee as I kept myself to the path. After a few wrong turns and the asking of which fork to take in the road I eventually reached my destination...Kaladim, the city of Dwarves.<BR><BR>
     I entered the gates and found it to be a rather gloomy city...dark and dank inside the walls of a large mountain. I went through many twists and turns as I searched for the one called Trantor Everhot. I finally found him in a small shop and asked him about the dwarven wire. He informed me that he indeed had the wire and he would be willing to give it to me if I would go see Tumpy Irontoe and bring him two Tumpy Tonics for it was his favorite drink and he had not the time to go himself. <BR><BR>
    I wandered about once again and found this Tumpy Irontoe in a small pub within the city. Inquiring about purchasing two of his Tumpy Tonics he told me he could surely make them for me but he needed two kiola nuts and a flask of water per each tonic. As I stood there a wee bit bewildered and beguiled he added, "You can purchase the kiola nuts from a vendor on Sister Island in the Ocean of Tears". I nodded my head to him and exited the city.<BR><BR>
   I sat for a moment thinking this quest is much more than I had thought it to be. But..I would continue on in earnest. I hailed a passer-by and asked where I might catch a boat to Sister Island. He informed me to continue along the path going east and I will reach the Docks of Faydwer. Casting my invisibility spell on myself once again I headed as directed and sure enough came to a docking place by the ocean. There were several docks and I knew not which to go to but noticed a small group of people standing near the end of one. I approached them and queried as to if they were waiting for a boat to Sister Island. After a few little snickers and whispers from those about, a kind gentleman informed me that they are waiting for a boat that will go to Freeport but if I take this boat and stay on it then I will be taken to Sister Island on the way back. I sat and waited....<BR><BR>
   Eventually the boat arrived and everyone scattered to get on. I sat once again as the voyage began, envisioning the trueshot bow in my hand. It was quite a lengthy trip but being my first voyage ever I found it rather exciting as I watched the little rocks and islands drifting by us. At times I thought we were to crash into them and at times I saw creatures standing along the shores or higher up on some of the peaks. I wondered if I waved if they would wave back. ;) The boat did dock at Freeport and I stayed on as instructed, this time not sitting for I wished not to miss my destination, the next port..if the man was at all accurate in his telling that is.<BR><BR>
   We did indeed dock at a place that had many shops and a woman standing in greeting to all new arrivals. I assumed it to be the Sister Island and disembarked from the boat heading to the various shops. It was not so difficult...probably the easiest part of this quest so far for the shop selling the nuts was the very first shop near the pier. I knew I needed four of the nuts to obtain the two tonics so I asked the vendor for four. She informed me that I did not have enough coin for four. I gasped and looked at the coin in my purse and then looked at the price of the nuts...she was most certainly right in her estimation and I felt like sobbing. Slowly walking back to the pier, I sat and waited....<BR><BR>
   The boat took me back once again to ButcherBlock, the zone area where the Faydwer dock was. I invised myself once again and headed back to Kaladim, hoping against hope that they had a bank there. With some searching and some begging for help I managed to find a bank and made sure to draw out more than enough coin to cover my purchase of the nuts and anything else that might come along...by now I was becoming quite skeptical of this quest you see. Returning to the docks, I sat and waited...<BR><BR>
    The voyage was not quite so interesting this time as it cruised along slowly, reaching Freeport and then sailing off once again toward the Sister Island. As we docked I once again left the boat and once again ran to the vendor shop and once again asked for the four kiola nuts. Smiling at the vendor as I received my purchase I ran back to the dock and hence..I sat and waited...<BR><BR>
    Returning for the third time to Kaladim, I sought out Tumpy Irontoe and offered him two kiola nuts at first in order to get one of the tonics. Trying to make the exchange he inquired about the flask of water that was also needed. "Oh yes, I near forgot". I reached into all my pouches and found no water! I had only milk with me for I was told it was cheaper than water. "Oh my...please wait!", I begged. "I will be back shortly with the water". With this said I ran as fast as I could looking for a vendor with water. I could not find one anywhere in the city but knew that there was a vendor near the dock who did sell water so I ran as quickly as I could. My heart was pounding and I could hardly take a breathe to ask the vendor for water. I made the exchange as quickly as I could and headed back to Tumpy. Hailing him, I gave him the flask of water but he did not seem to remember that I had already given him the nuts. I wailed, screaming at the top of my burning lungs,"I already gave you the nuts! Can you not remember a face that was here but a short moment ago?!!" He replied not and simply ignored my out burst. Kicking the door to the pub, I left and returned to the gate of the city. My head was throbbing terribly now and I knew I had no choice but to go purchase two more kiola nuts. It seemed I didn't care to run to the docks nor did I seem to care if something were to attack me on the way...I walked in silence, totally dismayed to the way this quest was going.....realizing that the Trueshot Longbow would not be had this day as well. I reached the dock just as the rain began to fall and as the rain disquised the tears on my face...I sat and waited...<BR><BR>
    I solemnly took the voyage this time..speaking to no one..caring less about the sunset that burst in radiant red across the ocean, pondering why I am bothering with this at all yet envisioning the bow that drew me to this point in the first place. We reached Sister Island and I left the boat to once again purchase two nuts. The boat does not wait long at dock for some reason and as quick as I could be I  reached the dock and again had to sit and wait....<BR><BR>
    As I reached the docks of Faydwer I looked inside my bags to make sure that I had enough water and the four kiola nuts needed. In finding myself equiped hopefully to complete this little quest I set once again for Kaladim. Upon entering the pub of Tumpy Irontoe I slapped down two kiola nuts and a flask of water. "Here!", I shouted to him as I attempted to make the exchange. "Well done, Carista!", he stated merrily and handed me one Tumpy Tonic. I placed two more kiola nuts and one other flask of water in his view and again shouted, "Here!" In turn he gave me the other tonic that I needed. I nodded at him without a word and left his pub to go find Trantor Everhot feeling almost like drinking these tonics myself after such an ordeal. He was not so hard to find this time and I entered his shop and hailed him asking again about the dwarven wire for my hope was that he would still be in the mood to make a deal with the tonics. He indeed was so I gave him the two tonics and he in turn gave me a spool of dwarven wire. {for the sake of the quest I must inform you "Do not stack the tonics when you give them to him..place one in each of two slots".}<BR><BR>


    I reached into my pocket and retrieved the notes I made as Maesyn related this quest to me. It seemed I must now go to Freeport and find the one named Jyles Windshot and get some treant wood from him. "Hummph!", I thought to myself, "I could have done that the numerous times I went by there on the boat."  I once again returned to the Faydwer docks and...sat and waited.<BR><BR>
    The boat arrived in Freeport and I disembarked wondering where I was to begin my search. I was in East Freeport and was told by a passerby that I could find this person in West Freeport at the Hogcallers Inn in a room upstairs. I worked my way through the city, marveling at the size of it and the hustle and bustle of so many people, guards and vendors. This was indeed the hub of the world! Reaching Hogcallers Inn I went up the stairs and found Jyles Windshot in a room there. I hailed him and asked him for some treant wood. He informed me that he needed a small lantern from East Freeport but was afraid to go purchase one himself for there were villians lurking about. He asked that if I would go get one for him then he would give me the treant wood. I rolled my eyes thinking, "What a wienie!". Sighing, I thought, "Alright, then". I went back to East Freeport and found a shop inside the gate to South Freeport and purchased a  lantern. Seeing no villians about I assumed this Jyles was either just too lazy to get it himself or he had an enemy here abouts that he didn't wish to face. Anyway, I returned to Jyles and gave him the lantern. He looked at it and said, "This lantern is too big, I need a SMALL lantern". Wanting to kick him in the shins I thought better of it lest a guard come take me away so I just stuck my tongue out at him and headed back to the shop where I had purchased this lantern. Looking over the stock I find a small lantern and returned once again to Jyles. He at least thanked me for it this time and gave me the treant wood I needed.<BR><BR>

   With dwarven wire and treant wood now safely tucked away in my pouch I once again retrieved my notes. Spiderling silk.... I pondered my ability to kill a spiderling at my young age but thought I might as well go take a look. I inquired and learned that I could find such creatures in the East commons outside of Freeport. Upon arriving there I found the spiderlings to be not too big a problem and after a few short battles happened upon a silk. Alright then, finally something quite simple to this quest.<BR><BR> 

   Last but not least was the micro servo. My information said I needed to go to Steamfont Mountains. I knew where this place was for I had heard of it during my stay in Kelethin. Therefore I needed to head back to that continent. Sitting on the boat I was feeling elation whelm in me...my task was near complete and I shall have the finest bow in all the land ;) Upon reaching Faydwer I decided the best thing to do was head back to Kelethin and inquire on the where abouts of Steamfont Mountains. It did not take long for directions and I headed back out along the path. Reaching an area called Lesser Faydwer I gasped. It was dark and dank..a wooded area that held unknown creatures to me. Fear struck me as I stood there determining how I shall get through this area without being attacked. It was but a moment later that a stranger was passing through and asked me if I needed assistance with something. I showed him my map and pointed to where I wished to go. "I am going in that direction and I can escort you there", he stated kindly. It was actually a short run along the left wall and we arrived quite safely. He asked my purpose and I told him what I was looking for. "You must kill rogue spiders for that", he informed me. I looked rather dismayed for this also was a new place to me with many strange creatures about and I was wondering how difficult a task this would be. Seeing my apprehension this stranger took pity on me. "Come, I will help you get what you need". Following him closely with a huge grin on my face we came upon some windmills. As I gazed up at the turning blades he told me to stay where I was and he would pull some rogue spiders close and kill them and I in turn could search them for a micro servo. The gods were with me to the ending of this quest for sure and after several searches I indeed found the micro servo needed. I was overwhelmed with delight!! My task complete!! I danced around and hugged my new found friend as he blushed to my excitement. "I thank you kindly for your assistance, M'Lord and now I must return to Kelethin to acquire a new and most powerful bow". "Allow me to escort you back out", he chuckled, as if he knew something I did not. 
He returned me to the path back to Kelethin and with a smile and a hug he went on his way. <BR><BR>

   I ran as fast as I could back to Kelethin and up into the city to where Maesyn was waiting. I placed all these acquired things into the backpack he had given me, combined them as requested and handed the bag to him...my face beaming in anticipation to what I will soon be holding in my hand. He accepted the bag most readily and handed me a stave, declaring that I needed to master the art of fletching to make the bow. "I what?!!", you could hear my scream throughout Kelethin. He seemed not disturbed by my outburst and replied, "Aye, Ye shall need this stave, dwarven wire, a mico servo and a planing tool. Then when you have mastered the skill of fletching you can combine these all in your fletching kit and thus make the Trueshot Longbow".  I sat on the ground and began to weep. Alas, it will be years before I will have this bow.<BR><BR>

   As the seasons passed I spent hours upon hours fletching arrows, producing better ones with each level of experience. Liquidating all my coin into this task. Though I had not yet reached the level of master I did attempt to make this bow at my 85th level of experience. I ran the continent getting the items needed and combined them in my fletching kit...only to fail. With each failure I had to redo the entire quest in order to get another stave. As I reached my 30th season I had mastered the art of fletching and continued attempting to make the bow as I also continued to increase my skills in fletch. 15 times I had attempted this quest, 15 times failed. I was dismayed and beginning to wonder if it was worth it at all. These bows were easily gotten for a price...probably much less than I had already placed into my arrow making. But how, after all this time, after the determined desire within myself to make this bow, could I feel a sense of gratification in buying one? I would have failed myself had I done so.<BR><BR>

   One day I had once again retrieved all that I needed to try my hand at the bow. My fletching had reached the level of 165, a far cry past being a master of it. I had taken all the wisdom and intelligence I could muster up in order to give me extra reassurance to succeeding. I sat in a quiet area and prayed to Tunare for a blessing. I was weary and tired...<BR><BR>
   Slowly I opened by fletching kit on the ground before me and placed the stave inside. I retrieved the micro servo from my pouch and carefully placed that along side the stave. I fumbled through my pocket searching for the dwarven wire and laid it into the kit. And lastly, with my hands trembling I pulled out my planing tool and set it next to the wire. I sat there staring at all these things for the longest time. Will this be my last attempt? Will I close this fletch kit never to open it again? I reached for the combine button to my kit and gave it a press, closing my eyes and saying one last prayer. I heard a rumbling in the distance, unlike my attempts before. I felt a glow of warmth and light surround me, unlike my attempts before. I opened my eyes and there laying before me was the most magnificent bow I had ever seen. Did I laugh? Did I smile?    No..........I wept. <BR><BR>

This is by far the longest quest I have ever had to do to date. More so because of the time I had to take to get my fletching high enough to succeed. This is also the most rewarding quest I have done and will probably always be so. As my story is told you can probably see why. I realize that there are other bows out there now that are much better than the original Trueshot but how is it possible for me to place this bow in a closet? Don't ask me why I don't use a better bow....don't ask me how much I paid for this bow. You probably wouldn't understand my answer ;) I realize that many players would prefer to buy items rather than do the quests. Each to their own. When I see someone with a trueshot in hand I dare not question how they came about their bow. Tis not for me to ask nor wonder. I just know that I hold mine in hand and I know how I came about mine. That's all I need to know ;)<BR><BR><BR>
