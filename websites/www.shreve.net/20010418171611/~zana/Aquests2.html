<H2>Four Quests at Once</H2>
</CENTER><BR>
<B>It is possible to do many minor preparations for these four quests while you are still quite low-level and I would recommend doing so.  In order to make or have made all the different types of Shadow Silk you will need four Shadow Wolf pelts, three silk swatches and four scrolls of Gather Shadows, an 8th level Necromancer spell.  Once you've collected these you can easily have someone with tailoring skill combine them for you or take up tailoring and do it yourself.  The person who did mine only had a skill level in the 30s at tailoring so they are not hard to make.  If you don't want to be bothered by gathering the ingredients you can always keep an eye out for tailors selling the various silks you need and get them all early on in the game.<BR><BR>
I started seriously working on these quests at level 24 because at that point I was able to take down some of the creatures that have quest items by myself and I like to solo.  All the items you get from Shadowed Men for these quests will be destroyed if you camp or go LD so either take the item straight to them or, if you need other items or have to log, have a friend kill you in a duel and loot everything but the Shadowed Man items from your corpse.  Then you can come back to your body later when you're ready to complete the quest and retrieve them.<BR><BR>
  Here is how I would begin if I had it all to do over again. Get in a Shadowed Man group in West Commons and kill them until you find a Shadowed Scythe on one of them.  Hit the nearest bank you can use and withdraw 550gp.  You will be using this to buy a Fire Opal from Genni in the Temple of Solusek Ro and she will not take any coin other than gold.  If there's no bank convenient you may just want to stop by the Temple at some point before you begin to actively pursue the quests and pick up an opal.  <BR><BR>
Enter the Temple and seek out an NPC named Vurgo.  Hail him and speak to him until he tells you he needs a Shadowed Scythe to make the Harvester.  Give him the scythe and he will give you a note for you to keep until you get the other three items he needs.  This is rather nice since you can turn in the shadowed item first and get a note in it's place so you don't have to worry about it popping if you go LD while running around.  Sylline is not so nice, she just wants everything at once.  On your way out of the Temple stop by Genni, hail her and talk to her until she offers to sell you a Fire Opal for your 550gp.  Now you are halfway through the Harvester quest and things get a bit harder.<BR><BR>
Head to Freeport, catch the boat and ride it almost to Sister Island in the Ocean of Tears.  Jump off as you approach the island and swim almost due south, bearing just a bit to the west, until you get to Goblin Isle.  (I'm not sure of the loc of this island but it is near the Isle of the Dead where the Gargoyles and Spectres are and the loc of that island is -700, -7000.)  This is a small island and you will easily be able to find the Goblin Headmaster.  The one I killed conned even to me at level 24 and had some nasty spells he used on me, you may want to bring a friend along for this one.  Make sure you pull him away from the shamen or they will heal him as he fights.  I pulled him when the camp was full and he was the only thing that came but that may have been just good luck for me.  However you decide to do it, kill him and take the Shadowed Knife.<BR><BR>
Swim back to Sister Island and catch the boat again.  Ride it all the way to the dock at Butcherblock Mountains and head on through Faydwer to Unrest.  Make sure you get there when it is camped heavily - late afternoon or later - because you will need some help in there.  You have to get a Fungus Eye from a Mortuary Fungus as your last item in the Harvester quest and while you're there you may as well pick up the Werebat wing you'll need later for the Robe quest.  There are several ways you can accomplish these goals.     Both creatures spawn in the basement so you will need to either go down there and get them or have someone pull them out of the house for you and your friends to deal with on the lawn.  If you're in your upper 20s in level you can try to get in a Torture Room group where you can just kill the things and take the items.  If you're doing it in your mid 20s like I was you can (if you are very lucky) have someone in your group pull the Werebat or Fungus out of the basement for you.  Beware the Fungus especially.  It has a Mort Drowsy spell that will make your party members unable to attack if they are affected by it.  If you can't get a pull from the basement, you can talk to someone in a group in the basement and ask them if you can loot an eye or wing if they get one.  Then you can fight around on the lawn or in the house until they call you and you bravely run down invisibly to get your item(s).<BR><BR>
Since you're already on the continent of Faydwer you might as well pop over to Mistmoore and nab the Sceptre of Sorrow you need for the Shadowbound Boots.  All the other items you need are on the continent of Antonica and if you get the Eye, the Wing and the Sceptre all in one trip you won't have to come back to Faydwer.  The Sceptre is ridiculously easy to obtain.  All you have to do is go to Mistmoore (invisible, of course), and sneak around the tower until you find a tunnel entrance in the rock wall of the zone.  Follow the winding tunnel until you come to a wrought-iron fence with a graveyard behind it.  Enter the graveyard and walk straight ahead to the crypt at the rear.  When you go into the crypt you will see a large sarcophagus directly in front of you.  Approach it in a straight line from the door and DO NOT go around to either side of it or you will fall into a pit trap.  Atop the sarcophagus is a little bag like you find on the ground when someone drops something.  Pick it up and you will see that it's a flower.  Now exit the crypt and go around behind it.  There is a named Shadowed Man back there with a book in his hand.  Give the flower to him and he will give you the Sceptre.  You can now complete one of the quests by heading back to the Temple and giving Vurgo the note he gave you in exchange for the Scythe and the other three items you have collected.  GIVE THEM ALL TO HIM AT THE SAME TIME.  If you hand him one item, then click him again and hand him the next item and so on he will not give you the Harvester.  You have to give him all four things in one trade for the quest to work.<BR><BR>
At this point you have several options.  I would head south through the Desert of Ro zones and into Innothule Swamp to get into Guk. At this point I would go for the Sceptre of Tears in Lower Guk.  This is another stealth mission like the Mistmoore one except that the Sceptre in Guk is much harder to find.  If you are unfamiliar with Guk you'll need to use the <A HREF="Aquests3.html">maps</A> I have here in order to get to the correct zone entrance to Lower Guk.  If you can't read a map there's not much I can do for you and you should seek out a different website.  After proceeding invisibly through Upper Guk you will zone into Lower Guk and come to a choice of left or right.  Take the left way and follow it down until you see a waterfall with some stairs beside it.  Go up the stairs and you will come to a room with a chair in it.  The sceptre is on the floor in front of the chair and all you have to do is pick it up and gate out.  It blends in with the floor somewhat so look carefully.  If you're not in your upper 20s by this point and are lacking an escort of other upper-20/low-30 friends I would leave the Nokta Shaman alone (unless you want to take the weenie way of standing around invis until someone lets you loot him) and head on to Rathe Mountains.<BR><BR>
If you are careful and stay near the zone to Lake Rathe you can solo Giant Skeletons at level 24.  Kill them until you get a Skeletal Finger and a Skeletal Toe.  Once you have both, head back to West Commons and camp the Shadowed Men until you get an Eye of Shadow and a Hand of Shadow (or pick these two things up off the corpse you left somewhere earlier) and head back to the Temple of Solusek Ro.<BR><BR>
Now that you have all the components for the Shadowbound Boots and Gloves, seek out Syllina.  Talk to her about the different quests until she tells you the components and then give them to her ALL AT ONCE like you did with Vurgo and the Harvester.  The game is almost over now and all you have to do is herd up a bunch of high-20/mid-30 friends and raid the Nokta Shaman in Upper Guk.  The main difficulty here is getting everyone to his spawn point and back out again alive.  This is most easily accomplished by bringing a bard along and using a song to invis/see-invis the whole group.  If you can't do that you have the options of fighting all the way there and back or having a caster put see invis on everyone and invis everyone.  I had no bard access and after three trips of fighting, invising, medding, see invising, medding, invising, fighting, dying, body retieval, more invising etc. we finally got the damn Globe of Shadow.  Hopefully by this time you have the Mask of Shadow sitting on a corpse somewhere (mine was on a corpse at Guk entrance) and can just pick it up, head to the Temple and turn all the items in to Syllina once again and seize the Robe.  If not... go camp Shadowed Men again until you get the Mask and finish up.<BR><BR>
As you can see, these quests are quite demanding on your time and patience.  However, once you have completed them all you should have a much deeper enjoyment and appreciation of the game than you would have if you sat around at Treants or Paw until you became bloated with enough platinum to buy these items from someone who is actually playing the game.  Remember... the name of the game is Everquest, not Everpurchase.  Before sending me any negative thoughts on the comment above please read the whole <A HREF="Athought.html">"Questing vs. Purchasing"</A> section of my Thoughts page.<BR><BR>
