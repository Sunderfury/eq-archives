<B>This rare spawn was seen and captured on film in the minor zone of Haughton.  The duration of the spawn was very limited...only around two hours.  Since they were not slain, it is unknown what they drop or of what quest they are a part.  Respawn time is also unknown but there are many who believe this was some sort of event and is unlikely to be repeated in less than a decade, if ever.  Anbhas is on the left, Glorfyndel is on the right.</B><BR><BR>
