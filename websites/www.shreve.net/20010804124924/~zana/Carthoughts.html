<B>These are my own personal views on some of the things I have encountered while playing, either alone or with others. Any who have viewed this site when I first placed it up will see a change in some of my thinking as I have journeyed onward. I expect as seasons pass that these "revised" views will change as well. Most often my views will change only because of changes made within the game via patches. I also expect that some of the facts may not be correct...I have tried to sway from mentioning facts just stating opinions by mostly myself and from comments made to me by others while questing. I will continually correct any misconceptions I may have made as I discover more about the game.<BR><BR> I realize that every char has their own way of playing the game. This is a good thing for it adds diversity.  My thoughts here are my way of venting certain issues and perhaps giving a little incite to what I have faced as a Ranger...they are not meant to sway people from doing other than they do or to change the world to a plane of all thinking as I do. I just thought I would mention this as you read into my venting..err thoughts. At the bottom of this page is my email address. I placed it here because I expect my thoughts might need enlightenment and you can surely critique anything I've said here.</B><BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="7rings/swordleft.jpg" WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="77" BORDER="0"></CENTER><BR>
<B>What is a Ranger and why would you choose that class? I chose a Ranger because I liked the concept of carrying a bow with me...excelling in archery and all the aspects to it. Ok, other classes can yeild a bow as well but its not their primary thing to do or be. It's the roleplaying aspect of it, I guess. A Ranger is a woodsy type person...a traveler..a guide. You can probably see by the topics listed below that these are the things that mostly concern a Ranger. I will say this...if you are a Ranger and do not fletch..then why are you a Ranger? If anything I would think that anyone who uses a bow frequently would make their own arrows. 

A Ranger is not a very difficult character to play really, just not very popular when you get up in the mid level seasons. They are basically melee'er types but their lack of high hit points makes them a prime target to go down quickly if being the main tank. Therefore, they usually avoid being the main tank and just assist as a backup. A Ranger is also able to cast some spells but they are far from being considered a caster. And even though they can heal somewhat, they are also far from being placed in that category. Soooo...melee'er Ye be. <BR><BR>

Now don't be frowning about it...there are some aspects to a Ranger that do make them sought out at times. A Ranger can track. In my early years and still at level 42 I am sometimes asked to track something. I've even been offered coin to do so. I will expand on this in the tracking section of this page. <BR><BR>

A Ranger can snare. This will slow a crit down and also stop him in his tracks sooner than he would normally. This is a big plus in the early years while gaining levels and still is at higher levels in groups. This also makes it easier for a Ranger to solo if he/she chooses to. I have not used root much. I don't know why really aside from the fact that when I got the spell half the things I tried to root weren't susceptible to it. Meaning..it didn't work on them. I think I am gonna ask about this some and see about using it more.<BR><BR>

Last but not least...I think a Ranger basically peaks at level 30. That's when their whole life changes. They get "spirit of the wolf". And as you all know, sow is constantly being asked for. I get into groups most often based on being able to cast that. This also opens the door to successful kiting. Great fun if you are the "kiter" and not the one trying to run behind whacking the crit when you can. I have seen a Ranger kiting a crit away from a group, since the group had no one to mez it, and run the crit around the zone until the group was ready for it. I find that an awesome thing to do and a lifesaver to the group. Unfortunately I am not good at it but am seeking help in learning it and perhaps someday I will have a topic about it when I can give some real input into it. </B><BR><BR>
<B>Sooo...a summary:<BR>
A Ranger can track, camo and snare at an early age. At 30 they can sow and at 39 levitate. Add all these things together and learn how to use them wisely and you'll have a damn good char to play around with and a lot of fun as well.  </B>

<CENTER><A NAME="TRACKING"></A><IMG SRC="7rings/bar1flip.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="88" BORDER="0"></CENTER><BR><BR><BR><H3><CENTER>TRACKING</CENTER></H3><BR>

 Tracking is one of the greatest assets a Ranger has and they are asked frequently to go with groups who are just hunting certain type crits because of the Rangers ease in tracking them down.  I also find it a godsend when lost or just trying to find someone.  But there are some misconceptions to tracking which I thought I would mention perhaps to enlighten a few people.<BR><BR> 
       Though one can track for a very long distance, they cannot track the whole continent.  I have not delved into finding out precisely how far one can track or if exp levels expand the distance but I find that trivial to the fact that if you aren't on my tracking then you're just not and that's that.  When I pull up my tracking, there is a list of players, npcs' and/or creatures to the left of my screen. Some of the latest features are that you can now have these things color coded as to how they con to you and also a scroll bar now so you can pretty much catch the entire zone on your list.<BR><BR>
      One of the greatest problems with tracking is hills and buildings.  We cannot track through these.  When you track something, you get these little messages saying they are to the right or left , straight ahead or behind you.  This continues as you move, eventually leading you in sight of the object. When near a hill, one can get a message saying it is straight ahead and to the left but when you turn a few steps to go that way it will quickly change to it is behind and to the right.  Eventually you feel as if you are turning in circles.  This can be very frustrating especially when you or your mate are in danger. I am learning to go around these obstacles and once again head myself toward my object but at times, especially in very rocky area it is still quite difficult. I hope that some people will have the patience to understand that tracking is not totally infallible.<BR><BR>  
     A few last words about tracking....if its not there, it can't be tracked...if you want a kodiak and there's none in the area of my tracking, I cannot conjure one up and make it be there. I can also not decipher if the objects are already being attacked by another, so if we run across the all of West commons to find something and it ends up already being taken by someone else, oh well....<BR><BR>
   There are some places that I will not track. One is frontier mountains because its near impossible to do with so many steep mountains. If I had to run a long distance as I tracked something chances are I'd get lost trying to bring it back to the party in that zone. Another place is the dreadlands. Being a Ranger when I am in a group there I am usually asked to pull. Hopefully it is because of my skill in archery {being able to pull from quite a distance} and because I can sow. I have heard people say its because I can track. Little do they know I don't track. There are enough crits out there that I don't need to go a long way to find something with tracking and seeing as its a fast pull and kill area no one is real fussy about what you bring to them. The Overthere is another example of this.<BR><BR>
They have improved the skill of tracking a great deal since I started playing the game. Thank god for that! I used to have many a gripe about tracking but in recent months these problems have been adjusted more to my satisfaction. Yeah Rangers!!    <BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="SENSE HEADING"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>SENSE HEADING</H3></CENTER><BR>Though I have heard and read that sense heading is a good thing that everyone gets as a skill, I find it a very difficult skill to raise. I suppose if you use it so often that it will read for you near each and every time that it could be quite beneficial in that you only need click on a button instead of digging in a pouch for your compass. I still find that even if it tells you what direction you are facing, if you aren't sure where you are going it isn't going to be of much help.  I will admit that I have used it on occasion when someone told me I needed to be heading in a certain direction. I expect if and when I should master this skill I may change my mind about it, but for now I rely on a compass, my surroundings and when I'm in an area where you can see the sky, I watch the clouds since the clouds move from the east to the west at all times.  I have also heard that if you drop a weapon it will always point to the north....{this has been verified as true but somehow I don't feel real comfortable with dropping my weapon on the ground}.<BR><BR>I have also learned how to use the "loc" system of finding one's way. I am still not real good at it yet but I think this is probably the fastest way to get from one place to another within a zone. Of course to use this you will either need some maps at hand with locations marked on them or as a lot of people do they shout asking for a location and most often will get a reply.<BR><BR>
Over time I have changed my thinking some about sense heading. I left the above thoughts up because I wanted you to realize why. In my younger years when traveling about wasn't so intense it mattered not that I would stop to reach in my pouch and check my compass. But now as my travels at times require me to get from one place to another quickly a click of a button as I am running is far better. Of course there is also the fact that if you have died, well guess where your compass is? Therefore I am working on getting my sense heading skill high enough so it reads most often and I will urge fellow Rangers to do the same. The only qualm I have ever heard mentioned about sense heading and I am quilty of this as well, is that it takes forever to gain a skill level in it. The best thing to do and a small blessing for sure is that you can practice sense heading while you sit and meditate and we all spend a great deal of time doing that or waiting for someone else to do that.<BR><BR>So I guess to sum it up...I was fortunate enough in my early years to receive a compass as a gift and because sense heading was so darn hard to raise I became spoiled to my compass. "Haha! All you fools out there sitting around trying to get up sense heading! I have a compass!" Little did I know...

<CENTER><A NAME="FORAGING"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>FORAGING</H3></CENTER><BR>This is another valuable skill to a Ranger. I have mastered this skill and can basically rely on it solely for my food and drink. I also find it a fun thing to forage up berries and vegetables and sometimes offer these to my fellow adventurers for a nice change in their diet ;)  Many times I forage up fishing grub which allows me to fish without buying worms and therefore gives me a supply of fish food. A very cost efficient skill and I can see its value when travelling far from any merchants selling food and water.  I have also heard of people buying the berries and vegetables in order to make things for their crafts...mainly brewers and bakers. Some things require only foraged items so the forage skill becomes quite unique in that respect.<BR><BR>  
   If you wish to save up berries and veggies without eating them the best way to do this is place them in a backpack in the very bottom right slot and place the other foods ahead of them.  You will munch on the other foods first before hitting on the berries and veggies.  This will give you time to get them to the bank or to the person purchasing them from you.<BR><BR>
   I think a minor misconception about foraging, which I have encountered therefore even mentioning this, was that the skill did not look into your backpack and see what you had, then forage up that which you lack or are low on.  It was a random thing and if you were low on water you might forage up fish grub nine times out of ten.  I say this because I have been low on water and had someone tell me to forage some up.  I feel like they think me less of a Ranger if I cannot do so. This has recently been adjusted also so that if you are low on water you will get water...same with food. Yet at times I just plain forget to forage...its not quite a priority while in a hunt or on a raid. Sooo, if I need to run to the store, then so be it...<BR><BR>Having mastered this skill to 100 I find new things to forage now. Radishes, cherries, rathe berries, mushrooms, etc. What I find interesting is that these foraged items will sell to a vendor for at least a gold piece each. This can add up to some plat with just a few clicks of a button.  So if I find that I have plenty other food I will place these items in the lower right corner of my inventory and sell them.<BR><BR>
Interestingly enough within the last few months of patches many new and sometimes rare foraged items are coming up. Many of these are used for quests now and most importantly the Ranger epic quest. I have heard tell that a Ranger had actually sold one of these foraged items to a person who needed it for a quest for 40pp. Nice ;) Many foragers ask what certain items are for. I haven't a clue either so I am recently delving into quests to find out. Over time I will extend this subject with a link to a page of foraged items and their use. Until then I am advising that you work on maxing out your foraging for some of these items are rare and the higher your foraging the more likely you will come across it. Also save anything that you are not sure of for it could be something you will need later on. Of course use your own discretion on this or you will have sacks and sacks full of little foraged items. <BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="HEALING"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER><BR><CENTER><H3>HEALING</H3></CENTER><BR>

At my ninth level, I received the minor healing spell and at level 20 this spell increased some...A nice little thing but not really worth much in a life threatening situation.  Although I give it credit for healing someone as their poison runs its course or healing someone when they are near unconsiousness, it is not that great when someone is getting hit harder than I can heal them.  It should be remembered that this is a MINOR healing. It has helped in some dire situations but basically it helps to build up health a little quicker BETWEEN hunts and allows you or anyone else to be prepared with health in case something should come and attack you before you are totally healed and ready to hunt again. I believe it is pure luck if you can manage to keep someone alive with minor healing in some pretty nasty fights. If you think you're going to need some heavy healing while hunting I suggest you would expect a caster with greater healing power to do this for you and not a Ranger. <BR><BR>Along with healing of course is bandaging. This is something I tend to forget to use most often. The only benefit I can see of skilling in bandaging is that it doesn't use up your mana. I do not know if as your skill increases in bandaging that eventually you will heal faster than using the minor heal spell. You can only bandage a person to half their life and then you'll have to heal with spells the rest of the way. I don't know if this changes any as you increase your skill or not..I have yet to get past half way without the message saying that you can't bandage beyond this point. Perhaps one other nice thing about bandaging, for what it's worth, is that when you are in a place that isn't near a bank to unload a lot of coin that you carry, you can find a vendor and purchase a ton of bandages thus relieving yourself of some coin and run around bandaging everyone in sight and upping your skill level in it. You'll also undoubtly become the nice guy in the area ;) One other thing I'd like to mention on bandaging that I basically find as touching...when I am kneeling down to bandage a wounded friend or as I sit wounded as I look on to a friend bandaging me, I feel a great sense of friendship and caring. At that moment the friendship bond grows ever stronger ;) <BR><BR>
At level 39 I received another heal spell. I believe it is the last I will receive but not sure so don't quote me on that. It's by far a nicer spell then I've had previously but it still is not all that, iffen you know what I mean. It's not going to make me a dire necessity as a group healer. I guess my main point of view on the ability to heal as a Ranger would be that it's a great asset for personal use when traveling alone and an occasional life saver if someone is near death from poison. <BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="PORTS"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>PORTS/BUFFS</H3></CENTER><BR>If you have not gotten the drift yet by reading some of my stories, I venture quite a bit. One day I may be in Halas, the next day I may be on the other side of the world in Kelethin. Some quests require you to go places...sometimes I just venture off with friends to help with something or sometimes just to explore new places.<BR><BR>Teleportation is a good thing...it saves time and undoubtedly takes away the boredom of perhaps sitting on a boat or running through long zones. My views on this issue has changed some over the seasons but at times I become a little unnerved. I have many friends who are very helpful when I'm in need and also guild mates who think nothing of coming to my aid. In my very early years I felt that some porters and casters do nothing but take advantage of their fellow adventurers by charging excessive amounts of coin for their services. Why so much? Because I find that people will pay it and sometimes offer even more. I didn't have that kind of coin then to avail such services nor did I care to if I had the coin. I felt I would rather walk the entire length of Norrath before I would toss a coin to a greedy thief. I'm talking about the people who have nothing to do so they sit and auction their services for a pretty plat. I'm talking about the people who are porting somewhere anyways yet will charge five others to take the ride with them. I'm talking about the person who sits on the dock in oasis and offers to cure disease or heal for a price and the poor souls with the disease or near death run to them as if they are gods and the gods sit there on the docks floating in the air and accept the coin and cast the spell acting as if they have just performed a miracle.  I can perhaps understand a reasonably large donation if someone is seeking a teleport or a buff and one is going out of their way to assist them.<BR><BR>   
I think about the only thing that I have willingly paid for as a requirement to getting it, is a bind. A very vital thing when traveling about and planning to hunt in an area. With no other recourse one must pay and most often the binder does need to come to you unless of course they just happen to be sitting there.  <BR><BR>
One excuse I hear alot is that they had to pay for their spells to be able to use them on you, why shouldn't they get some money back? Heh, I paid for my spells to kill the crits for you when in your group...you gonna pay me some coin to help with that cost? You want to make some good coin? Go out and join groups and earn your keep by aiding others in battle...I'll tell you some good spots where good coin can be made iffen ya need to know.<BR>
<BR>
I, along with many {ok..this topic has basically singled out only some but there are alot of those "somes" out there} don't accept payment for services rendered. You ask yourself, "What can a Ranger hand out that would be worth a coin or two to someone else?" Sows, number one...I have been offered pp for sowing someone and never yet have accepted it. Tracking for them...actually I have been offered some good coin to track something, but heh, iffen I have the time to do this service then I'm not busy and therefore am not being put out of my way to accept coin to do it.<BR><BR>
As my seasons progressed I have had to dish out coin and willingly, but my adventures require it. Most often because I didn't get bound somewhere and had to get back to my body. I am most certain this is where the high price of getting a port exchanges hands. I've seen people offer 50pp for a port because they are in firiona and their body is in Velious. I can see this and this isn't what I am talking about. <BR><BR>
I have had friends bewildered by the fact that I will sit and wait for a boat and not look for a port. I guess this has been instilled in me at a young age and holds true to date. Ok, I'm hard headed to this issue and basically most of the time that I take a port is because tis what a friend might prefer to do and they usually pay for it.<BR><BR>
Ok..enough on this subject..I know I have ranted haphazardly on it. Please keep in mind that these thoughts do not include people who go out of their way to help. Aye, pay them and pay them well....

<CENTER><A NAME="ENCUMBER"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>ENCUMBRANCE</H3></CENTER><BR>


Encumbrance seems to be a world wide burden ;) Near everyone I know at some point in time has to deal with it. Through some research and shared advice I have learned to relieve myself of a great part of Encumbrance that haunted me all the time a while back. Therefore I wish to share some of these ideas with you..<BR><BR>For starters, I expect you should take a look at yourself. Look at your armor and inventory of backpacks. As a Ranger my strength status is not real high to be able to carry a great load around with me. I started out buying chain mail for it was obviously cool looking and did add greater protection but I learned that banded was much better for me not only in protection but most of it weighed a lot less. So I sold all my chainmail and purchased banded armor. I took some what of a loss so I suggest you take a look at what armor you are purchasing as for as weight goes and check to see what is out there that might be better and lighter. You'll be surprised to what you may find and in the end save yourself some coin.<BR><BR>Another thing that one constantly needs to carry are backpacks. I found that I had a whole inventory full of backpacks but couldn't use a few of them because my encumbrance in perhaps filling one didn't allow me to add more until I sold what I had. Therefore it occurred to me that I didn't need all of them. I placed some of them in the bank for storage. I carry a fletching kit with me at all times for I never know when I'm going to have to go make arrows. The kit will hold a lot of items as well as a backpack. So it serves that purpose as well. <BR><BR>This was a cool idea that someone shared with me and all others that I have passed this on to also think its a great idea. When you are especially burdoned with coin in an area that has no bank near by, go to a vendor and buy all the iron rations you can with the silver and copper you have on you. Then sell all the iron rations back to the vendor and he will pay you with gold coins. You will lose some coin in this transaction but all in all you will be carrying alot less coin and you will notice your encumbrance ratio drop considerably.  I have also mentioned buying bandages in my healing section on this page and I have heard that some buy stackable gems that they have some use for.<BR><BR>I have heard about "bankers" in areas like Lake Rathe and South Karana. What they do is offer to change your coin for you. They will give you platinum for your gold and perhaps gold for your silver and copper. They will charge you a fee to do so and since I have never used this service I am not going to comment on whether this might be another rip off or not. All I can say about it is don't give someone your money with the thought that they will go to the bank and change it for you there. Make the exchange in trade then and there. You may never see this person again and that's alot of coin to just hand over in total trust to perhaps a complete stranger.<BR><BR>
Still to date many young Rangers complain about an encumbrance problem. Take heart my friends for over time it will alliviate itself. You will be able to purchase items that have strength plusses, you will get that strength spell that will definitely be a plus to how much you can tote around at any given time and you will learn what you should carry and what you shouldn't. I am personally a pack rat, perse. I hate it really but I receive gifts often and to get rid of them is unheard of...sentimental value ya know ;)<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="FLETCH"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER>

<BR><CENTER><H3>FLETCHING</H3></CENTER><BR>I have some thoughts on fletching that I think I will include on my fletching page. There is one issue about it though that I thought this was as good a place as any to vent it. <BR><BR>As a newbie Ranger I went to see my mentor Maelyn Trueshot who not only gave me some nice things to start out with but also gave me my first quest. Aye, that being the trueshot longbow quest. Of course, being new I did not realize that upon finishing this quest, the best I got was a stave to make the bow with. I asked him how to make the bow and he told me that once I have mastered the art of fletching that I would be able to make the bow with some other components that he listed. Well, I achieved the status of master in the fletching skill and tried my hand at making the bow. I failed. I then worked my way up to 123 in fletching and during this time tried my hand at making the bow 4 more times and failed. Now, he said that when I become a master fletcher that I could make the bow. My skill level reveals that I have mastered fletching yet I still cannot make the bow. I have also read that many people did not succeed in making the bow until skill 165 or better in fletching. My point is...why say you are a master in fletching, have your mentor say you can make the bow when mastered in fletching yet you have to go like way beyond that to even conceivably make the bow unless pure luck happens to come your way? A very frustrating endeavor of mine....arggggg....end of venting.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><A NAME="TWINK"></A><A HREF="#contents"><IMG SRC="7rings/accent1.jpg" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="89" BORDER="0" ALT="back to contents"></A></CENTER><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H3>TWINKS</H3></CENTER><BR>

A long time ago it seemed that twinking was a big issue. Now if you don't know what that is it's basically when a person starts a second low level char and equips it with high level armor and weapons, etc.  Some people even cringe when new people are given "gifts" of relatively much higher levels than they should be wearing. The theory behind this is, from what I have read anyway, is that its a cheat and sort of takes away from the ambiance of the game or something.<BR><BR>I personally find nothing wrong with a person who has already delved into the playing of the game to want to start a new char and eliminate some of the slowness and tedium of achieving levels by strengthening their new char up front. I feel that everyone plays the game the way they want and a "twink" isn't affecting my game in any way shape or form...well, sort of...there is one issue that I don't like about it.<BR><BR>Perhaps the best way to approach this subject is to explain how some things make me feel....so I shall start with the Trueshot Longbow. This bow is sellable...you can actually buy one from a player for quite a high price. This bow is also a Ranger only quest. It's not really a difficult quest but is time consuming and the worst part is that one has to tend to their fletching and get it high enough to make the bow.  I had worked on this quest since my 5th season and at 35th level and 163 in fletching skill I finally managed to hold it in my hand. It was a glorious day that day but somehow the ambiance of my achievement went along the wayside when someone asked me how much I paid for it.  <BR><BR>I think this also holds true with some of the armor quests. To get the armor you have to actually be at places to get the "no drop" items yet the end result is a class only piece of armor that you can sell to Jack on the street! So somehow when I don my ivy armor I'm not going to feel so special about it.<BR><BR>I don't fault people who want to sell this kind of stuff...the game makes them able to do so and heh, everyone wants to make some good coin. Neither do I fault people who buy this stuff...its tempting...eliminates the wait..and if you can afford it, well? I just feel that these kinds of things do affect my char...because I can't relish the fact that I actually got this through a quest and that it has some meaning to my char. With any char you might play....doesn't it sort of irk you when a level seven of your class is wearing something that you really took the time and patience to gain? "I am a level 45 wearing this...." "Well, I'm a level seven wearing it as well". Something wrong with that scenario for sure..<BR><BR>
Once my Ranger outgrows her quest items I will destroy them before I will sell them or give them away...friend or no.<BR><BR>That's really all I have to say on this subject...I do want to emphasis that I am speaking of "quest" items only...not hunted or camped items. After all, there has to be a market for something out there. I expect you are thinking that I am contradicting myself. What's the difference between a quest item and going out and actually killing for a dropped item? Not much I suppose...and I suppose a truly "untwinked" character went out and got everything they could possibly need via hunts and quests. That is awesome iffen you have the time and patience to do so. I just think that certain things should be sacred...and to me that is the trueshot bow, the Ranger etched ivy quests and any other quest that requires a sequence of events to obtain. I cringe at seeing Rangers selling these things to other Rangers instead of encouraging their fellow mate to do the quests for a much greater reward in the satisfaction of having done it. Don't sell them the damn thing and think you are helping them by doing so...go out and offer to help them achieve it instead.<BR><BR><BR>
