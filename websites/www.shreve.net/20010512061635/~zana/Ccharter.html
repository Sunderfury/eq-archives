<B>The members of the Wayward Travelers are dedicated to the exploration of Norrath. We are a fellowship of adventurers in the truest sense. A Wayward Traveler is a bold explorer with the heart of a poet seeking out knowledge and new experiences but taking the time to enjoy the beauty and natural wonders of the world of which we are a part. <BR><BR>Have you ever felt the call of the open road? Have you wondered what treasures may lie just on the other side of a steep mountain pass? If you have felt these things then you may br right for the Wayward Travelers. All races and classes are accepted by the guild as long as you share our need to seek new sights, visit new places and meet new people. We are not obsessed with gaining levels nor do we lust after powerful magics except as they help us to survive the new experiences we crave. In our travels we seek new lore, both magical and mundane. We seek the rush of excitement as we battle never before seen creatures or glimpse new vistas of this brave new world we call home. Our members are respectful of each other and of our fellow players we may meet during our travels. We always conduct ourselves honorably and will help others we meet if we are able. We freely share our knowledge and lore with others in Norrath as we believe that knowledge is the true key to power. We are the Wayward Traverlers, adventurers, warriors, artisans, explorers, scholars, scribes, seekers and story-tellers.<BR><BR>
