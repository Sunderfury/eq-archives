<H2><CENTER><A NAME="qvp"></A>Questing vs. Purchasing</CENTER></H2>

<B>I am firmly convinced that the game is more fun if one actually quests for or camps their own items instead of buying the things they want from others.  In my early days of play I followed what seemed to be the prevailing practice and bought things for myself.  Around level 12 I saved up 40p and bought a Gossamer Robe because I was tired of wearing grey. {g}  The next step up in robes for me, in my thinking, was the FBR.  It's price was prohibitive.  Around level 20 I was getting close to the 200p that was required in those days and a friend and guild brother of mine asked me what I was doing.  I cheerily told him, "Camping Treants and I almost have enough plat saved to get my FBR."  He replied with a "bah!" and told me I was high enough level to go camp it myself with a group.  We immediately took off for Najena and hooked up with some other people there who were camping it as well.  About two and a half hours and many fights later I had an FBR that cost me nothing but time, hps and mana.  I then used the plat I had saved for the robe to buy int enhancing jewelry instead.  The next day I told another friend of mine that I had the FBR I'd been longing for and he said, "Cool... how much did you have to pay for it?"  The feeling of satisfaction I got when I replied, "Nothing, I took it off Najena's dead body." and heard his reply of, "No shit?  That's f**king killer!" was enough to convince me never to buy an item I could get for myself again.<BR><BR>

I'm not a complete purist about never purchasing things.  Recently I bought a Savant's Cap because it was better than the silk rag I had on my head.  I made this purchase because the thing that drops the cap, and everything around it, was green to me at my level and I would have received no experience and had no real challenge in getting it.  My self-imposed restriction on buying is only for those things I can obtain for myself at my current level or higher and still encounter a challenge.<BR><BR>
I was recently asked by someone how much one of the pieces of Shadowbound gear I have cost, and when I told him that I quest for items and don't buy them he actually asked me, "Then how do you get the items you need to kill the higher level MOBs?"  My answer to this is that you really don't need items you're incapable of getting with the help of a group to kill higher level things.  If something drops an item, you must not need that item to kill it or nobody would ever have gotten it in the first place.<BR><BR>
Another thing about the buying and selling of quest items that disturbs me is that these things are obtained by characters ridiculously out of the level range in which they could expect to have them.  It made me gag when I ran through Nektulos forest the other day and I saw an 8th level Necromancer decked out in the Robe of Enshroudment I busted my ass all the way up through level 29 to get.  Enough said about that.<BR><BR>
I realize that different people play the game for different reasons and I don't try to impose my views on others or harass them for their mercantile activities.  I said nothing to the 8th level Necromancer with the Robe.  I also realize that there may be some players with even stricter personal restrictions than mine who would look upon my pages detailing quests as "cheesy" since the instructions there allow people to take shortcuts and not seek out all on their own every little piece of the puzzle.  I'm not writing this to condemn those who choose to buy things, but simply to let people know how I feel - that the game is more fun and interesting when you get your own quest items.<BR><BR>
In conclusion, something I would really be interested in seeing is a "no-merchant" server where all quest items are no-drop.  That would enable those of us who feel the same way to go there where we wouldn't have to be bothered by the sight of 4th level characters wearing 30th level gear.<BR><BR>
