	<TD><B>Robyyn is a Human Monk and my oldest and<BR> dearest friend;) Not only had we ventured often<BR> together in Everquest but also in many other<BR> rpg's throughout the years. I guess I can best<BR> describe him as one of the most adventurous<BR>people I know who takes a lot of risks but always<BR> seems to know what he's doing ;) With him gritting<BR> his teeth, I have tried his patience on many occasions<BR> as he showed me the ways of Norrath.<BR> I thank you for that, Robyyn ;)</B></TD>
