The meeting began with a congratulations to Tangledown Taiga for reaching her 50th level. Congratulations Tangle!!<BR><BR>
We started off with the bringing in of two more Officers. Please Congratulate Seyra Songweaver and Kikadaf Healstorm, our newly elected Officers ;) They were brought forward and each gave a little speech ;)<BR><BR>
Our first order of business was the introduction to a new induction procedure. People who wish to join our Guild will now need to go through a "meet and greet" process. They will be required to meet at least three members of our Guild including one Officer. The participation of all members is required in order to accomplish this. If a person approaches you in a desire to join our Guild you will basically become their sponsor and try to help them meet three other members including an Officer. While doing this all members should try to put forth an effort to have this interested person join in on their hunting if possible. This whole concept is based on learning more about a person wanting in and them learning more about us as a Guild. Once this criteria is met an Officer can then induct that person into our Guild. The Officer inducting will need to get that persons class/race/level and also their email addy and forward that information to the Leader. Either the Officer or the Leader will post a welcome on the message board and a letter will be sent to the new member giving them our homepage address and any other important information they may need to know. Feel free to give this potential member our homepage address at any given time so they can also check out our page as they work towards becoming a member. It may also be a good idea to invite them to our next event if one is scheduled close to their wanting in. This procedure will hopefully eliminate seeing "strangers" within guildsay. <BR><BR>
Along this same line was addressing the bringing in of secondary chars. Secondary chars will not have to go through the "meet and greet" procedure since their main chars are already known members but they must basically "apply" in order to be brought into the guild. If you have a secondary character that you want brought into the guild you will need to notify an Officer of who it is... class/race/level and name of that char. The Officer will then notify the Leader and it will be recorded in the books and posted as a welcome. The secondary char will then be able to be inducted. This procedure shouldn't take more than a day or two depending on the quickness of the Officer to send off the information to the Leader. The purpose of this is also to avoid having "strangers" in guildsay. <BR><BR>
A word on these two procedures...<BR>
As you have noticed I used the word "strangers" in both instances..new inductions and secondary chars. We have on several occasions come into the game to find people in guildsay that we have no idea who they are. Though one Officer obviously knows who it is a good many, including other Officers and especially the Leader, have no clue who this member is. This is not a good thing to not know who your members or brothers and sisters are. Hopefully these two procedures will remedy that. <BR><BR>
I will be doing some work on the members page to list members secondary chars separately. This will make our members list more true to an actual head count of members.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>---------------------------------------------------</B></CENTER><BR>
The next issue discussed was the Guild Lockers. It is a great thing that so many have contributed items to the lockers to the point that they are overflowing. I am not talking about just one locker char, but two. Many of these items have been in the lockers since its inception near a year ago which brings me to the conclusion that no one really wants them. So it was brought forth as to how to rid ourselves of some of these items. With many ideas being suggested it was decided that I will place a small list up each month of some of the items that should be taken out. Everyone will basically have a last call chance to take these items. This does NOT mean you should take these items and sell them off on your own accord. If you can't use them for your char or perhaps your secondary chars they will be given to newbies, offered to our sister guilds or sold either to the general public or a vendor. Tamato has been placed in charge of the giving away or selling of these items returning to the guild chest the proceeds that will be used for guild events. <BR><BR>
We have a listing of all locker items on our homepage. It is asked that you look over this list before you offer anything else to help curb the abundance of things we have. It seems senseless to have three of something and be offered another.<BR><BR>
Tangledown was good enough to take all the runes and turn them into researched wizard spells. This was a great help in reducing the load. I will be accepting all runes with this in mind. I would also like to see if anyone who does research with words or pages would like to do the same thing. <BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>-----------------------------------------</B></CENTER><BR> 
It was asked if anyone had questions about the new message board. Though we had a slight problem with the password just recently it is now fixed. We also organized it a little better to make looking for certain postings a lot easier. It seems that everyone is quite happy with it. I had sent out letters to all the members informing them or reminding them about the address to the homepage. Along with this I gave out the password to the members only forums on the message board. If you have been overlooked please send me an email at zana@shreve.net and I will see that you get it. <BR><BR>

Exedeus came forward and brought up a few topics: In our gallery of pictures we have a section for all pictures of our members. We have been trying to work on it as we can and our goal is to get a pic of every member in the guild. We ask that you submit a picture of yourself to either myself or Exedeus if you don't see your picture up there. Exedeus's email addy is Exedeus@cfl.rr.com   We ask if possible to send the pictures in jpg format. If you can't that's alright for we can do that for you as well.<BR><BR>
Exedeus also mentioned submitting biographies of yourself. It doesn't have to be anything lengthy but something that tells about your existance as your char. If this is accomplished I will incorporate the biographies to your name on the members list. In the meantime there is a biography forum on the message board where you can post your story.<BR><BR>
Lastly, Exedeus brought up the idea of guild alliances and joining with them in raids and hunts. A reminder that we are already allied with the House of Isildur and Progeny of Reliance. There is a good chance that in the near future we may be allying ourselves with Guardians of the Lost. This is something that is going to be worked on and they were invited to participate with us on the plans for a future Kedge Keep raid. At this point Deuregar stepped forward and informed us that the House of Isildur would like to schedule a night of fun in arena dueling. We are hoping to include our other guild, Progeny of Reliance to this event. We have not been active with these alliances and hopefully we can see a change in that with some combined events, hunts or raids. I asked Deuregar to put a posting on the board about the arena event so we can find out what might be a good day and time to schedule it. <BR><BR>
Herewith the meeting came to a close.<BR><BR>
I would like to add that as soon as I can get to it you will be seeing the changes made in reference to alts on the members board, you will see the induction procedure incorporated as a "Decree" on the Decree page as an addendum to our charter and I will be updating the Guild chest page and posting the list of some of the items that I think we don't really have to keep in the lockers.
