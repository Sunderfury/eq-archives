   She walks through the marketplace, happening upon the one called St.Nick, sitting on his throne of wood, receiving the children one by one. She wishes she were but a child, longing to tell him of her desire for Christmas Eve coming. Placing one child off his knee, he turns his head and looks into the face of Xanadu.
