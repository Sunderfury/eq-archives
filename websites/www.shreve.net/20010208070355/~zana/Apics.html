	<TD><B>Rolland Roxxhard, Paladin and<BR> member of Keepers of the Balance.<BR>  Rolland is the only Paladin I've<BR> seen so far wielding a scythe.  This<BR> was taken in South Karana near the<BR> Paw entrance.  I believe the scythe<BR> is the one dropped by Lord Grimrot,<BR> who spawns further north in the zone.</B></TD>

<CENTER><B>Some nice shots of Quillmane, the winged horse rare spawn of South Karana.  He drops feathered leggings most of the time but, if you're really lucky, you can get the coveted Pegasus Cloak which bestows the ability to levitate on its wearer.  The pretty lighting effects in the first picture were provided by the person killing Quillmane as he fought off the skeletons I trained into the fight while running up to take the picture.  I took the skeletons with me when I left so hopefully there was no permanent harm done.</B></CENTER><BR><BR><BR>

Dev is a Wood Elf Druid who is almost always seen in four-footed form as here (I'll try to get a rare bipedal shot of him later) and Wyld is a Barbarian Shaman proficient in the art of absorbing Hill Giant damage.</B></TD>
