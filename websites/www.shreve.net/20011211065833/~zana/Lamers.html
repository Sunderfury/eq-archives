<BR><BR>Any and everyone who has ventured enough in Norrath must have run into what I call "Lamers". People who are annoying to those around them. People who are rude, who cheat and who converse with profanity or just pure nonsense. Of course we all know that beggers are number one on this list for they are everywhere and quite annoying. You know, the lazy ones. Since I run into these types so frequently I won't be relating many tales about them unless they are quite exceptional to the norm. I won't be naming names unless I feel they need to be recognized by name. I generally don't pay much mind to the names of the little annoying brats out there anyway. I am not going to totally sway away from profanity but I promise not to be obnoxious about it. After all, there are times I'll be really pissed about something that I wish to relate here. I expect I will be adding more little stories as I live my life in Norrath amongst the Lamers so I think I'll add them to the top so ya won't have to scroll down past what ya might have already read. Nice of me, eh? Cause I'm not a Lamer!!!<BR><BR>

It's  funny to me that since I started this page a few days ago it seems that every time I am in the game now I find some lame incident to bring back here to relate to you. Lots of it out there...probably more than I noticed before. But that's all cool. If the world was filled with nothing but perfection it would be a dull world for sure. I'm sure I've done some lame things at times...of course you know I won't tell of them on my own page *grins evilly*.  Soooo...to all you lamers out there...go for it! Ya make me look good and give me something to write about ;)  Oh, a wee bit of a disclaimer here....this does not include assholes who get me killed, rob me or make my life hell during my time online. You all can just go away. <BR><BR><BR>

It's been awhile since I've added anything here but its surely not because of a lack of lamers. Just a lack of time to working on this page. Here are some tidbits that I have picked up recently and made note of. Not all lame really, some just rather humorous.<BR><BR>

<I>Person One shouts: "I need a heal at guard tower. I'm unconsious now".<BR>
Person Two shouts: "Come to the rings"</I><BR><BR>---------------------------------<BR><BR>
<I>A player was shouting for a port from freeport to firiona. Not uncommon. He stood there for a good half hour, constantly spamming for this port. Someone finally shouts back, "I'll tell you what, I'll make a run to Firiona and give you a tell when I get there to see if you got your port yet". Had to add this one, I thought it too funny *g*</I><BR><BR>-------------------------------------------<BR><BR>
<I>I wonder if when you get over 100 in sense heading and master it if it will then say, "You KNOW you are heading North" instead of " You think you are heading North".</I><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"A Training Course"</H2></CENTER>

This is not really about a specific incident, though a specific incident did bring this to mind. People who think nothing of bringing a mob to another group. Example: Our group had just finished fighting a couple of crits. We were low on mana and some of us low on health. As we were sitting to start recouperating a "friend" brought two mobs over to where we were. He knew we were there and intentionally brought them over and then specified which one to take and which one was his. We just started whacking away...after all, we were being attacked. And our new found puller was yelling not to hit on that one cause it was his. Hello?
Not only was it lame to even bring a mob over to us assuming we would be ready...{Aye, that's what we do, we just sit about waiting for people to bring us their kills they can't handle, dah}...but then he had the audacity to specify what ones we could kill!!!! Lame, lame, lame.  Luckily our health and mana was up enough that no one died...it could have very well happened with a trick like that. <BR><BR>

Common curtesy when you have a mob you can't handle --------} yell for help or at least give a shout that you are bringing a mob as you try to outrun it to a zone. Oh, and please don't run through an area where it is common for newbies to be hunting or any commonly camped areas for that matter.<BR><BR>

Of course, I will say this on behalf of you trainer lamers...there are people out there worse than you. Aye....the dumbasses that sit at a zone exit and whine about being trained. They're not only stupid but also whiners....a double dose of lameness.  Think about it...Ya sit at a zone exit that is a highway to salvation for alot of people out there. You expect these people to think, "Oh, I shouldn't go to the zone so I don't die because someone might be sitting there medding or chatting or something"? If you are sitting at a zone exit please think that there's a good possibility someone is gonna come along and bring a friend with them. Move it or lose it. The zone is right behind Ya for god's sake!

<CENTER><B><H2>"The Gesture Jester"</H2></B></CENTER>
One day while standing by the west gate in Freeport, minding my own business, a fellow came up to me and started making rude gestures towards me. I stood there rather profound as to why he was doing that...just standing there watching as he repeated these annoying little gestures over and over again. Finally I say to him, "You know, I am not really impressed by your actions, M'Lord Twit". He then proceeded to laugh at me...over and over and over again. Becoming quite annoyed with him I made myself invisible. He stood there a moment and then moved over to a young lass sitting near by and started doing the same thing to her! At this time I was wondering how I could get him to stop this rude behaviour. If it were possible I'd have laid him out right then and there...but alas, can't do that. Aha! I have an idea...<BR><BR>I became visible and walked over to where he was doing his little performance and offered him a trade. Aye, a fishing grub, hehe. They sure do come in handy for things like this ;) He refused the trade so I offered him another..and another..and another. Gee, I think he was becoming annoyed for suddenly he yells out, "Carista! Will you stop doing that?!!"  I had to chuckle to myself you know as I told him, "I will stop doing this when you stop with your rude gestures". He looked at me, said "Alright!" and ran off. I certainly expect he will continue doing this..he seems to find some humor in it that others apparantly can't see. Oh well...<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"Begger I"</H2></CENTER>Aye, this is a begger story but I find it rather cute and is sort of a way to deal with beggers in a sense. It seemed to work this time anyway.<BR><BR>I had just entered East Commons when a chap hailed me and asked me for some coin so he could buy a gossamer robe. *sighs*.. I replied to him, "I'll tell you what, I am looking for ruined wolf skins and since I hate to kill wolves I will pay you some coin for each skin you can bring me." He seemed rather delighted to that stating that he could do that, and he ran off. Quite soon he returned with a skin and I gave him 9 pieces of gold. He said he would go look for some more and after a short time he gives me a tell, "I can't find any more". Hehe... I told him, "Well, I actually only need two more and if you can find two more I will give you two plat for them". He gives me another tell, "Is that all? I need more than that!" Well now..."M'lord, ruined pelts are only worth a few silver you know so I think I am being quite generous with my offer", I informed him. Very soon a reply back, "Forget it, I can't do this any more." Hehe..."Alright", I state. I start to head down the path and here this shout, "Wait! Carista! Wait! I found one!". I was starting to feel for this little begger...aye, my heart was softening up some. I gave him two plat for that skin and gave him some advice on how to "make" some coin. A short while later I did a who is on him and he was gone..I assumed he camped. Now, I doubt this little rendevous changed his begging ways but at least for a short time he wasn't begging but sort of "earning" his keep. I think for now on I will try this tactic on all approaching beggers...give them a little task to do in return for some coin. It can't hurt.<BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"And the Winning Whiner Is...."</H2></CENTER>
Whine: To utter a high pitched plaintive or distressed cry. Well, that's what Webster says. We refer to "whiners" as, ummmmm...spoiled little brats who cry and scream and have a hissy fit iffen they don't get their own way? How's that?<BR><BR>
Aye..there are whiners in the game...several...often. Some are justifiable I suppose but in those cases I take them out of the whining category and place them under "legit gripers". *shrugs* In any case, here is a prime example of a "whiner"....<BR><BR>
Sitting at the West gate in Freeport..{as you can see this is a prime spot to meet all kinds}...a fellow runs up, sits down and proceeds to shout across the zone that someone ks'd him. Stole his prey ---} for those of you who have been in a daze for a long time. The apparantly accused chap came forward and tried to explain that he wasn't ksing. The whiner kept on about it saying that he didn't need help, that he was at full health and the chap ks'd him which took experience away from him. {With the accused coming forward like he did, I trully think there was a misunderstanding about the whole thing. It happens sometimes Ya know.} Anyways...guess what the kill was? A fire beetle. Aye, you heard me right. <BR><BR>The chap tried to make amends by offering the whiner something..I don't know if it was coin or an item but the whiner refused the offer and kept on with his...well...whining. Several of us looked on and tried to speak with this whiner. He informed us all that this was only a secondary char that he needed to level to 5 so he could do something and that he had a 50 some main char. Well now...doesn't that beat all. I offered to buff him and stay by the gate so he could run to me for heals and that way he would get experience rather quickly. Ya know...power level the poor thing. He sat there pouting and said "no". <BR><BR>The best comment made through this terrible ordeal of his was made by someone who said, "Ya know, in all this time you have been sitting here whining about losing experience off of one little fire beetle you could have been out there gaining experience". <BR><BR>This is by far a number one needed to be mentioned whining lamer. Get a life, bud! Oh wait..he has a 50 something one..hmmmm...I wonder how much whining got him that far?

<CENTER><H2>"The Know It All Knower"</H2></CENTER>
I want to tell these two stories together for they are pretty much the same and they both pretty much changed my life..and not to the better. They affected me greatly and have stayed with me to this day. Perhaps you will understand as you read.<BR><BR>I want to add this here because this was recent and I really can't believe this happened to me. I was in a group with a designated main puller, a mezzer and various others. The main puller brings a couple of mobs and of course I'm *coughs* assisting him. Suddenly I notice everyone on a different mob. I quickly switch. This happened several times and I'm beginning to wonder what the f**k is going on! So I ask. The main puller laughs and says, "Oh, I was just hugging that one". Hugging? What the hell is hugging?! Ok, I may be stupid but sometimes you group with people who have their own ideas of what assist means and have their own vocabulary when communicating in a group. I know I'm suppose to know how every person in Norrath hunts. Just do me a favor, iffen you are a "hugger" just tell me which ones you aren't going to be hugging and maybe I'll look like I know what I'm doing. <BR><BR><BR>
I was in my early 20's and working for experience by getting into groups at the paw spires in North Karana. I found a group that had an enchanter in it. I asked who the puller was and would assist the puller, obviously eh? We were doing just fine, though one member in the group seemed to know how to play every character there is and was telling each and everyone what to do. Rather annoying. At one point the puller pulled two gnolls. I was on the puller, assisting him. Things were a little chaotic but eventually the crits went down. I receive a tell from Sir Knowitall, "Why were you beating on the crit that the enchanter had mezmirized?" Hmmmmm...."M'Lord, I was beating on the crit that the puller had targeted". "Well, the enchanter mezzed that crit so we switched to the other", he informed me, "YOU could have gotten us all killed." I left that group and was so disturbed that I ran to my camp and sat. Was I truelly at fault? Why would an enchanter mez the crit that the puller is on, therefore everyone else would be on it too? Am I to keep track of who the enchanter decides to mez because she just happened to have that one targeted instead of the one that no one is beating on? Get my point?<BR><BR>Here's the other similar incident...<BR>I was invited to go on an efreeti boot raid. It was mostly one certain guild but several outsiders were invited as well. It was my first time in that place. There were four groups...Aye, four...meaning 24 people total. There was only one enchanter for the lot of us and this was a concern but it was decided to go ahead with it. I was placed in a group and told who the leader of the group was and to pay attention to what he says. The communication between all groups was going to be done via /ooc. I was also told who the main puller was. The main puller and the enchanter were in the first group, I was in the last group. That meant that there were near 20 people in front of me. As we proceeded inward all was going well. We reached an area where there was but a ledge and lava all about..not even near the efreeti camp yet. 24 people standing about this ledge. The puller went ahead of everyone and pulled a train from hell. My group leader said to assist the puller at all times. I was doing so..people were starting to drop quickly. No one was to run..just keep fighting for ease in corpse retrieval. To run is to get lost..not good. The main puller went down...my group leader went down. There was no communication being sent out /ooc by the main organizer. I just kept beating on what ever was about until eventually our whole party died. I get a tell from the main organizer, "Why didn't you assist the enchanter? He was getting beat on and you didn't assist and he died, therefore we all died". I was truelly aghast to this statement. 24 people in a small place and I was the reason we all bit it! I wasn't even told who the enchanter was and he was in a group 20 people ahead of me!! I didn't say much of anything...we did a corpse retrieval and ended the hunt right there. Later there was a post on this guilds message board that the hunt went bad because a certain someone didn't assist the enchanter and the enchanter died. *sighs*<BR><BR>
These two incidences left a permanent mark on me. I have a fear of joining groups with strangers because I will do something wrong. Perhaps I didn't do what I should have..perhaps I was at fault..but, ya know..I don't think a finger should be placed directly on me for these two things. You read it...figure it out. I have been on an efreeti raid since with a much smaller group of people and it went quite well. We got to the efreeti room and camped it very easily but unfortunately the boot man never showed. I have learned quite recently that this guild I first went with is getting a reputation for unsuccessful raids and disasterous plane raids. No knowledge, organization or communication. Ok, does that make me feel better about my particular incident? Aye..some...
