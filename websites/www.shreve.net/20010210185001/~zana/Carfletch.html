<B>One of the reasons I chose a Ranger as my character is because I liked the thought of using a bow. So obviously I was to learn the trade of fletching to coincide with that. Now fletching to me is a very tedious and time consuming thing to do because you always have to buy four different components in quantity and then transfer these components one by one into your fletching kit. Even though you can drag these items one by one by holding down your control key, it is still time consuming and tedious. So one really has to have not only the devotion to it but also the patience. I have run into many a high level Ranger who didn't fletch at all and this sort of made me gasp. They bought their bows and buy their arrows and that is all good since trade skills are as I have stated twice already...very tedious. I must admit there are times when I have almost thought to just buy the Trueshot and be done with it, but I grit my teeth and as you will read on you will see why I haven't done this.<BR><BR>There are two reasons I wanted to increase my skills in fletching...one is so I could make my own arrows and another is the satisfaction of making the Trueshot Long Bow, which to me is the ultimate goal in mastering this trade in the first place. You can read about the Trueshot Long Bow quest in my quest section...though I think it should be called the Trueshot Stave quest since that's what ya end up with at the end and not the bow itself.<BR><BR>As in any trade, to gain skill levels the expense becomes greater and greater each time. I have researched many a web site to find out the best way to go about making arrows that will gain me skill level but at the cheapest cost. I have found a list that I have been following and is true to everything it says as I endeavor to gain skill. At the bottom of this page is first a table of components and what their stats are so you will know what type of arrows you can make and also a table of the cheapest components needed to gain skill and the level that they will become trivial to you so you can start on the next listed. I am not going to include prices or the stats of the arrows themselves for my intent here is only to help those trying to fletch their way up in skill and as you go you will know what you are paying and what you are getting in return. <BR><BR>As far as what to do with all these arrows? Well, in the beginning I suggest just using what you make. They are cheap enough, near as cheap or cheaper than buying arrows from a vendor. You can also sell these arrows for the cost and perhaps a small profit is a reasonable price to charge that people will pay. I expect that while you are skilling in your fletching you are also using your archery skills and advancing there as well. You will know what type of arrows you like to use best with what type of bow you are using.  I have read some articles on what type of arrow to use as far as range goes and have still to decipher what they are meaning. My question is, if you have a bow that has a range of say 125 and you use an arrow with a range of 25 will the arrow get to your target? I expect that common sense would be that you would use an arrow equal to the range of the bow or better then you will be assured of hitting your target. So as you start progressing into the more costly arrows you will have to consider a few things. Do you want to use these arrows and basically toss the cost into the air at crits? Do you actually think you can sell these arrows at cost even? If you notice the damage of the arrow will slowly increase but the range will vary. So what is your alternative to making these arrows to gain skill? Sell them back to the vendor. You will take somewhat of a loss but will recover a greater portion of your cost to make the arrows you wish to use. Its better than tossing them in the air for sure and recover nothing and you most assuredly won't be selling arrows for 5 plat a stack to at least break even.  <BR><BR>If you have noticed I mention nothing about bows..at least not yet.  I think that making bows can give you skill gain but then what do you do with them? You can't use them all, ya know. This could probably be a good way to recover your expenses and make a small profit to boot but I am not a merchant type person who tries to sell things on a daily basis so I have not delved much into making bows for skill gain instead of arrows. I have made my own bows for my use and increased my type of bow as I increased my skill to make a better bow.  Therefore, I don't have much contribution to make about fletching so far as bows are concerned....perhaps later when I reach my goal and decide if at all to merchant bows I might have something to say about bow making. In the by and by, iffen you want to know about bow making and delve more into that instead of arrows there are many websites available to you.<BR><BR>Looking at the stats of the components I have designed an arrow that I like to use personally. I have found that there are others out there who also like to use this type arrow and I have even sold stacks of them for a small profit. So though these arrows are not the cheapest you can make they are sellable. The arrow I am referring to is the class 2 bone point arrow.  The stats on them are a damage of 2 and range of 125.  I sell them easily for 2plat per stack of 20. Even sold 160 of them at one time for a good profit. I suggest trying to make this arrow even if it is not on the list of skill gain, though if you are low enough you would probably gain some. I think I was able to make this arrow with a high percentage of success at about level 60 or so in fletching and gained skill. As of now, they are trivial to me but I make them anyway for my own use. The components for this arrow is as follows:  field point, bone shaft, medium nock and parabolic fletch.<BR><BR>So how good is your bow and choice of arrows working for you?  Dexterity....the higher your dex the better your chances of hitting harder and continually getting that critical hit. Of course one would hope to eventually get better bows as their character grows by either fletching one up or affording to buy one and I think the arrows are a matter of choice. First of all, never buy a bow from a vendor. As we all know, vendors are ridiculously over priced anyway and this includes a bow. More than not you will see a vendor selling a hunting bow or a long bow...you can easily buy a better bow than either of these two from a fletcher with far less coin and they will probably throw some arrows in the bargain to boot. At least I would.<BR><BR>One last thing before I bring up the tables I mentioned...storage of arrows. Now this may seem silly but I like my quiver. If you are a role-player, which I truely am, then you must have a quiver. Silly is the fact that a quiver only has four slots where as you can use a backpack of eight slots to hold your arrows. I fill my quiver and also hold arrows in reserve in a backpack. I think that if the game made it such that one could actually see an archer with a quiver strapped across his back that all would have one regardless of how many slots it had. <BR><BR>Oh..one more last thing..though I have mastered my skill in fletching I still have failed many a time at making the Trueshot..you can read my venting of this on my thoughts page under fletching.  I just wanted to say that at least having achieved the level of "Master" to this trade I can assume if anything that I have enough knowledge of it now to give opinions and advise to the fletching trade..I hope that is what I have done here. Umm...did someone say something about a Raincaller Bow?  Arggg....can hardly wait to get to that subject....</B><BR><BR><B>Since I found this first table they have added the magic arrows which I believe the point of it is a replacement of the bladed point. I'll check into what the combination is to make the magic arrow and see if it replaces any of the combinations listed on the second chart. I have never bothered to make any magic arrows yet but I might give it a shot. I can't see using such an expensive arrow to kite anything that can only be hit by magic but it might be nice to have a stack with me so when I at least use my bow to draw a magic hit only crit that I'll at least give it a wee bit of damage at the start. One other thought here is that as you can see all arrows, even the cheapest on this table have a range starting at 50. Regular vendor arrows have a range of 25. Sometimes I ponder why anyone who uses a bow doesn't at least fletch their own arrows for use since they are by far cheaper and better? I guess they just don't want to bother with the tediousness of it all (shrugs).</B><BR><BR><BR>

</TABLE><BR><BR><BR><B>When I first started fletching I had found a small bit of information on how to proceed after becoming trivial the first time, I think it took me to about the third trivial stage...then I wasn't sure what to do.  I started just mixing and matching and was either making arrows that were trivial or making combinations with a very low success rate. After finding I was surely wasting a lot of good coin I found this table and have been using it all along. Not sure what's going to happen when I get past level 162 but I will hopefully remember to write down at what point the next steps become trivial and I'll add those in. Now, there is the possibility that I may make my Trueshot inbetween here somewhere in which case I might not further my skill in fletching and the table below will remain as is.</B><BR><BR><BR>
