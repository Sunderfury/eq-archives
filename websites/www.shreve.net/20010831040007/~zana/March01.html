<B><H3><CENTER>"A Message from your Leader"</CENTER></H3>
The past month has not been a good month for our Guild. A raid went bad...we lost a couple of very dear friends. The atmosphere has been quite solemn. My message this month is twofold...one to pull us back together once again and the other to see what we may have learned. <BR><BR>
I have done much thinking this past month as to what to do to make things better. I have sought out some guidance and hope to come up with ideas that will strengthen us and unite us as a family. Try as I might to fix things it still requires the support of our Officers and our members. I can't do this alone and frankly I don't want to do this alone. You will be seeing some posts on the message board that will show the efforts made to get back on our feet and keep moving forward. I ask that you all reach a hand to one another, lift each other up, brush each other off and gather close. We can get through this...I just need a hand from all of you to pick me up and show me the direction we are to go in. After all, I tend to get lost ;)<BR><BR>
Raids....we need these. We have to do these in order to keep members activated. And by learning to do good raids we will strengthen our guild to helping other guilds and become much richer for it. Soooo...what have we learned so far?  Allow me to go back some and express what I feel...<BR><BR>
The raid in Runnyeye...the night was spent with one of our clerics doing nothing but rezzing people. Listening to the conversations I was getting the impression that, "oh well, I died..where's the rezzing cleric". People were running about, getting lost and not really caring for they seemed to think a rez was at hand. We also had some who weren't grouped and no one seemed to care. In behalf of our clerics or other rezzing types, I think rezzes should be a shared effort. If you go on a raid prepare to die and if you are fortunate to get a rez good. Get bound close to the area...and don't expect an experiance rez. Take what you can get and make up for what you lost in battle. Why one would take advantage of a member who is also trying to enjoy the experience of a raid is beyond me. <BR><BR>
Mistmoore raid....I am not going to place total blame on our guild for the failure of this raid. First of all...some who signed up did not show. Do you realize what affect this can have on a raid? I have been told that a good organizer to a raid should be able to regroup on short notice. Perhaps...but I find it a more difficult thing to do when there are two guilds and the communication is thwarted without the ability to guildsay everything. We had low levels in the castle who shouldn't have been there...we had people not grouped once again. What did we learn from this raid? My thought was and still is, that we need to learn to do successful raids within our own guild before we attempt raids of such a high degree of danger with others. <BR><BR>
Last but not least..the raid of Kaesora...first and foremost I commend Talayen for his efforts in organizing this raid. I think he knew exactly what he was doing and is a prime example of a damn good organizer. So what went wrong? First...people being late and expecting ports to the area. Another thought here..why do our porters have to spend the night porting people instead of being able to participate in the raid? People were asking for ports to the raid two hours after the raid was to start!!! I, for one, will never ever tolerate this again. This raid was planned well in advance to everyone being able to at least be on the same continent. Aside from that...one of the things that caused a disaster to the group there was that the leader, organizer of this raid, was cast aside and that led to a train of crits that killed the whole party. The organizer of a raid is the leader for the night...he/she scrutinizes the raid prior to it. To ignore this fact and take matters into your own hands will lead to chaos and disaster. <BR><BR>To reiterate a few things about raids:<BR><BR>Sign up and if you do, plan to be there.<BR><BR>Get yourself there prior to the raid..if you are to be late then find a means to get there other than asking someone in the raid to come get you. I realize that some places are not familiar, but if you are at least on the same continent someone can come get you without having to actually go a great distance to do so. <BR><BR>
Bind yourself close...don't expect a rez but if its available take whats available. <BR><BR>
Listen to the leader of the raid and do what he/she says. Don't sit there and say, "I'm bored, I think I'll pull a train and get us all killed" or "I think I'll wander off and see what's out there".  <BR><BR>
<I>{these are my exclusive thoughts...if you wish to rebut and add your own thoughts, please send me an email to zana@shreve.net and I will add or revise}
