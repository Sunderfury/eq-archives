<B>So you're interested in Brewing?  Even if you don't want to brew yourself, the table below can be entertaining as you find out just exactly what you've been drinking all this time. {g}  Each row in the table is set up with the name of the beverage followed by the ingredients required and the type of container you need for it.  The act of brewing itself is really very simple.  You just find a brew barrel in a town somewhere, click on it to open the combine window, put all the ingredients for your beverage AND its container into the brew barrel and hit the combine button at the bottom.  Just remember - If the table calls for 2 of something put one in one slot and the next in another.  Don't stack ingredients in the brew barrel.  Make things one at a time... a 10 stack of each ingredient will not yield you 10 beverages if you hit combine with all that in there.<BR><BR>
I started by brewing Short Ales.  Yes, Short Beer is supposedly easier but Short Ale is cheaper to make and you get skill gain from failing as well as succeeding so what the hell?  Somewhere around high-20s to low-30s I switched to making Gypsy Wine and Fish Wine, which took me up into the high-40s or low 50s or something.  Then I switched to "real" wines, the Reds and Whites.  Around this time I also began playing with O'Tujim's but with all the ingredients and the cask container it requires I found it to be more trouble than it was worth.  Red and White Wines took me up to skill 70 where I began distilling Vodka.  I tried Vodka several times before reaching level 70 but never had a success until I hit 70. Since skill 70 I've been pumping out vodkas and then turning them into Hulgarsh for more skill gain.  Somewhere around skill 120 I took a shot at making a Bleeding Brain.  I've heard this is the most difficult drink in the game to make and it will take you up to skill 168. Theoretically, this is where brewers cap out because there's nothing hard enough to brew for you to get skill gain after that... don't know if this is true... just what I heard.  I'm around skill 123 now and my brew sessions consist mostly of sitting down with 40 veggies or so, making a bunch of Vodka and then converting what I can into Bleeding Brains.<BR><BR>
If anyone knows any recipes not listed in the table I'd love to hear from them about it.  Also, if anyone knows of a drink that will take your skill past 168 (or knows that the 168 story is a crock) I'd like to hear about that also.  Good luck, good brewing, good drinking... {g} </B><BR><BR>
