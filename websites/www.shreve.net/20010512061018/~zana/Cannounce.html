</TABLE><BR><BR><BR><B>This page is devoted to the additions made to the Guild charter. The Guild charter remains in itself to be the actual charter of our guild and these additions decreed here are policies and programs that have been officially voted in as seemed warranted over time by our leader and active officials of the guild as a means to strengthen our guild.</B><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"Officers"</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>(October, 2000)
</CENTER><BR>
<B>At times it is necessary to add new officers to the Guild in order to keep balance and order among members. Here is a listing of the requirements needed and looked at when choosing an officer. This list was designed by our Leader and Second-In-Command of the Guild. Let it be further known that Officers are brought in based on need and must have a unanimous vote by all present Officers:<BR><BR>
Must properly exhibit all the qualities of a Wayward Traveler as stated on the Charter.<BR>Must be willing to create, host or help with guild events.<BR>Should be open and knowledgeable about the guild.<BR>Must have the ability to answer all questions regarding the guild and the guild's purpose.<BR>Must be willing to travel the Lands of Norrath in order to help induct or take care of Guild business.<BR>Must be able to attend most Guild meetings, this includes all member meetings and/or Officer meetings.<BR>Must be able to give input or suggestions to Guild issues.<BR>Must be available within the game for a reasonable amount of time.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"Second-In-Command"</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>(October, 2000)</CENTER><BR>

<B>A "Second-In-Command" was introduced and brought into the Guild as a means to help organize and keep the Guild under control. This title is held by a person who will take care of Guild business when our Leader is not available. This person will also work side by side with the Guild Leader in keeping unity and balance within the Guild. This includes the keeping of records of Guild members, recognizing problems that might occur and being aware of all situations related to the Guild. This person is to be an Officer of the Guild and unanimously voted into this higher rank by all the other Officers of the Guild. Be it known to this date that Gwaltron Lancelot holds the title of "Second-In-Command" to our Leader, Carista Locsley. </B><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"Alliances"</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>(July, 2000)</CENTER><BR>
<B>An alliance has been made with the "House of Isildur" and recently with "Progeny of Reliance". The members of these guilds will be given the respect, guidance and assistance as if they were our own brothers and sisters. These alliances were made to further our friendships and strenghen our guild in our mutual cause to the game.<BR><BR>It is befitting at this time to announce the Leaders of these Guilds:<BR><BR>Carista Locsley - Leader of the "Wayward Travelers"<BR>Zoid Isildur - Leader of the "House of Isildur"<BR>Fundador Porbotella - Leader of "Progeny of Reliance"</B><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"Official Homepage"</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>(June, 2000)</CENTER><BR>
<B>A change has been made in the keeping of the Guild Homepage. A new page has been presented by Carista Locsley and has been accepted as the Official Wayward Traveler Guild Homepage. Actually, this is where you are now if you are reading this.<BR><BR>There will be a change made on the Innoruuk.com page stating this is our new site and also all newbies to the guild or potential players who wish to visit our site will be referred to this one. Members are urged to browse through the all of it and any suggestions, ideas or comments would be helpful in making this a very informative site of our Guild.</B><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"Membership"</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>(June, 2000)</CENTER><BR>
<B>At times when things are slow within the guild and participation is at a minimum it is necessary to make a strong push toward inductions. There was one concern to this which has unfortunately happened in the past and that is of old members returning to the guild and after a short period of time they leave once again. The leaving of any member in a guild is not a good thing since the guild strives to make the guild environment as happy, prosperous and beneficial to all its members. We have noticed that the ones most apt to leave the guild are the ones who come back or bring in a different char that they seldom play.<BR><BR>Therefore, with this thought in mind it was decided and voted in by the guild officers that any member will have two opportunities to be asked into the guild and there after a meeting will be called of guild officers as to allowing a previous member or an alternate char of theirs back in once again, reviewing the circumstances of this member and the why they left and the why of their wanting to return. This, of course, does not include any bugs where a member should lose his guild tag.</B><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"Locker System"</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>(May, 2000)</CENTER><BR>

<B>There had been some thoughts to a locker system within the guild for quite awhile and was finally introduced and put into effect. The idea of the lockers is for members to donate items they feel will help out a fellow member rather than to sell them to a vendor or to the public.<BR><BR>The lockers have been divided up into two separate units, one being the armory housing armor, weapons and miscellaneous items; the other being the library consisting of words, runes and pages. At this time Carista has developed a locker char for the armory and for the library. This is who you will need to contact in reference to the lockers.<BR><BR>With the initiation of this system some items have already been donated and a separate page, called the Guild Chest has been created on this homepage. All the information concerning the lockers is posted there along with a list of the items and stats of some of them. </B><BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>"Mentor Program"<BR>
</H2><CENTER>(April, 2000)</CENTER>
</CENTER><BR>


<B>It has been brought up for suggestion and acknowledged that we will strive to produce a mentor program that will help unify all levels within the guild. A "Mentor" will be a member of the guild who will watch over and perhaps plan hunts or at the very least help in anyway possible, a member of the guild who is in his/her experience level range. <BR><BR>The qualifications for being a Mentor are none other than the willingness to take the time to seek out your fellow brothers and sisters in your range level and add some input in helping them advance to greater levels through planned hunts or advice as to where to hunt. The thought is that if you plan a hunt to start that those in your range will be there for it and perhaps hang around the area there after...meaning that you will run into them periodically and hunt together randomly.  It is not the intent that a mentor will continuously have to plan events for their group level. It is to perhaps initiate an event to show like members where they can hunt with success. It is also to unite fellow members together...to hunt together...to adventure together and share their experiences as they become stronger and more aware of what might possibly be out there for them.<BR><BR>We ask for volunteers to help with this cause...though all do help each other as best we can, we do need the extra time volunteered to seek out members who feel left out of things, struggling to find a place to go. <BR><BR>Our officers are classified automatically as mentors for tis their place to watch over all members. However, one need not be an officer to participate in this program. <BR><BR><BR>
