<H2><CENTER><B>Happy New Years!!!!

<CENTER><B><A HREF="#Jan">Calendar of Events</A></B></CENTER><BR><BR>
With the new year beginning we will be seeing many new things coming about within the guild. New leadership has been a recent occurrance and with it you will see some changes and improvements in the coming year ahead.<BR><BR>I know that these calendar pages get quite lengthy but I try to get as much information out to you as I can about the goings on of the guild. I will not make changes to the initial writings here so once you have read it you can basically bypass it with the link I've provided that will send you down to the Calendar of events. Any thing new and important that needs to be added will be announced on the main page and I expect I may add a link for special notices or announcements. I know I tend to get wordy but I hope that all appreciate the thoughts and indepth detail that I try to send across to avoid confusion or question. I think our new message board will alleviate alot of my problems as to where to place what on the homepage. <BR><BR>At one point I tried to keep tabs on the accomplishments of members but I found that I couldn't keep track of the all of it. Therefore I basically stopped doing that. I feel that accomplishments to certain levels and perhaps difficult quests should be recognized but until I can find a way to do so without eliminating anyone I don't see it feasible. Perhaps a forum on the new message board would be a good way for each to announce their success. In the meantime, a Kudos to all for what you have achieved thus far!! It's quite refreshing that there has been so much success by so many that I can't keep track of it all ;)<BR><BR> We have officially initiated the new message board that we presented to you via a posting on the old board. Please try to start using it and during this transition we are here to help you with it. I have started to send out personal letters to all members so all are aware of this change. There are several reasons why we decided to make this change and all the members who are now using it find it to their liking. You don't have to make fancy signatures or have little icons to use the board. If you want to do those types of things we can walk you through them. We just stress that everyone use it so all posted information is in one place.<BR><BR>
We have also voted in a new induction procedure which will involve all members. It will not officially go into effect until we have an all member meeting in order to discuss this plan and answer questions. It will basically mean that new members wanting into the guild will go through a procedure of meeting and greeting at least three members. This way we will get to know them and they will get to know us. We will then have an official induction meeting once a month to bring these qualified players into the guild. We find that this procedure will help us keep track of who is who within the guild and will also give new potential members a chance to see what we are about. <BR>
<BR>
Along this same line is the bringing in of secondary chars. We have witnessed quite often new names popping up in guildsay and no one knowing who they are. Most often they are secondary chars of our present members. We have no problems with secondary chars of current members joining the guild but it is not a good thing when even the Leader or the Officers have no clue who they are. Of course it's obvious that at least one Officer knows who they are in order to have brought them in and this too will be remedied with a simple solution. If you wish to bring in a secondary char you will need to notify an Officer. Before that Officer can bring you in, they will send me an email as to who you are and the name/class/rank/level of your secondary char. {If you wish your secondary char to be anonymous in reference to your initial char then please state that}. This will then be posted on the new message board. Once you see it posted {shouldn't take more than a day} then your seconday char is a go on being inducted into the guild. A secondary char does not have to go through the "meet and greet" procedure since you already know your guildmates.<BR>
<BR>
  
We are also delving into the need for a couple more Officers and will be announcing our decision in the near future. <BR><BR>There will be an all member meeting in the near future to discuss the above issues. I will be sure to post it on the calendar when I have set a day and time.<BR><BR><BR>
<H3><CENTER><U><B>"WAYWARD TRAVELER OF THE MONTH"</B></U></CENTER></H3>
The Wayward Traveler of the Month program was initiated to encourage participation by all guild members and also to get to know each member a little better over time with some pictures and an interview. We had decided not to base the choosing of this member by their accomplishments or input to the guild but by a drawing. This was to give everyone an equal chance in planning a hunt, quest, etc. of their choice and also because it would be most difficult to pick out one of many members who are quite active within the guild environment. In December we ran across a slight problem with this. The member chosen had decided to take a leave of absence from the game for awhile. Because of the approaching holidays and knowing how busy that can make ones real life, we decided not to redraw for December. As you can see the holidays have put somewhat of a damper on events as it is. You will see January pick up some on events and the Wayward Traveler of the Month program will continue. Therefore.....<BR>
<B><CENTER>Wayward Traveler of the Month for January -------} ???????????</CENTER></B><BR><BR>
<H3><CENTER><B><U>"WORDS FROM YOUR LEADER"</U></B></CENTER></H3><BR>

Bringing in a new year I'd like to refresh everyone on the Wayward Traveler Guild Officials:<BR><BR>

Gwaltron Lancelot ---- Second in Command<BR>
Laithis Delarosa ---- Officer<BR>

<B>Webmaster ---- Carista Locsley<BR>
Gallery Editors ---- Exedeus Delarosa & Carista Locsley<BR>

<BR><BR>I would like to announce at this time that <B>Gwaltron Lancelot</B> has achieved his 50th season!! Huzzah Gwaltron!!! Congratulations and well done!!!<BR><BR>
I would also like to introduce the following new members brought into our family during the past month. Please give them a hearty Wayward Traveler welcome when you see them in the game ;)<BR><BR>
<B>Aalanin</B> - Dwarf / Paladin<BR>
<B>Radorn Slayzmoore</B> - Human / Paladin<BR>
<B>Krio</B> - HighElf / Paladin<BR><BR>
I would like to see everyone take the time this month to look over the all of the Guild Homepage once again. Reflect on our Guild Code and Declaration pages. Look over the Quest, Lockers, Poems & Stories pages and see if perhaps you can contribute something to these. This is your page...filled with things about yourself. I'd like to see more input by all members to make this even a better page. I have striven to make this one of the best and most informative homepages of any guild we know. Though I have been rewarded with kind words of a job well done, this page isn't done yet and can be improved. Improved with member input. <BR><BR>
I'd also like to do a little clearing out of the lockers. Most of these items have been collecting dust since the formation of the lockers at the beginning of last year. I call all casters to please look over the words, runes and pages listed and inform me as to what are basically useless to keep stored. I would also like to have you make out a wish list of words, runes and pages that are difficult to find so we can inform you that we have received them as a locker contribution. This will also inform other members that these are needed contributions. I will not be accepting duplicates of what is already there at this time. I ask members who have started secondary chars that have been inducted into the guild and reached level 10 to look at the lockers and ask to use some of these things to help your char along. My goal is to try to rid the lockers of items that are of no use to anyone. We will discuss at the all member meeting how to dispose of these items and what to do with the coin should we sell them. I guess until this is resolved, for the by and by I am going to be a wee bit picky as to what is accepted into the lockers. I appreciate all the donations that have been made for I know you could have just sold these things but have chosen instead to aide a fellow guildmate. I applaud you all to the fact that our lockers are indeed overflowing ;)<BR><BR><BR><BR>
