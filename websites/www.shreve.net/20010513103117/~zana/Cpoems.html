<CENTER><B><U><H3>Carista Locsley </H3></U></B></CENTER>

<CENTER>She was young, a fifth season, a Ranger in need</CENTER><CENTER>Of a bow that she'd dreamed of, the Trueshot indeed.
</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>She went to her trainer and asked of this quest,</CENTER>
<CENTER>He replied with an answer, "Bring this...and the rest".</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>She traveled and searched for the items he needed
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Her reward so undaunted, her goal near completed.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>She returned to the trainer and asked for the bow</CENTER>
<CENTER>He gave her a stave and said, "This you must know".
</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>"To get such a bow you must master at fletch".</CENTER>
<CENTER>She threw up her hands..said, "There's always a catch!"</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Her coin slowly dwindling, her vision grew narrow</CENTER>
<CENTER>As the seasons went by she fletched many an arrow.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>At Thirtieth season and fifteen times failed</CENTER>
<CENTER>She sat with her kit and then Tunare she hailed.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>"Please help me with this for my patience draws near.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'm bout to give up, of this I do fear!"
</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>With a click of a button and a shout through the land</CENTER>
<CENTER>She stood glorious before the world..her Trueshot in hand!
</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>{Carista holds up her Trueshot bow and says, " The End"}</CENTER>

<CENTER>Of all the lands there are to roam
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Kelethin is still my home.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>A vast eccentric city high in the trees</CENTER>
<CENTER>I long for the Elven breeze.
</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>At the Songwriters Guild is where I made my start</CENTER>
<CENTER>Since then I have grown much in my art.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Group buffing and healing were my specialties
</CENTER>

<CENTER>But now I'm acclaimed for my mind-clearing clarity</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Of all the instruments that I have seen
</CENTER>
<CENTER>None can compare to my precious tamborine.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>I swiftly run through lands without a care
</CENTER>
<CENTER>My enemies only catch sight of my flare.
</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>But the finest of my journeys I have not mentioned yet
</CENTER>
<CENTER>It is the time myself and the Wayward Travelers met.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>We plot and scheme to increase hands</CENTER>
<CENTER>To gain ancient artifacts in Norrath lands.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Our brave members gather at any cost</CENTER>
<CENTER>And hope Carista gets not lost.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Of all our members in her we truelly need</CENTER>
<CENTER>For she gives us posts to read.
</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>My bard like manner has run its course.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I must end with this verse so my voice be not hoarse.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>{Seyra takes a bow}</CENTER>

<CENTER>What is love if I cannot spend it with you?</CENTER>
<CENTER>You, who's eyes pierce right through me...</CENTER>
<CENTER>You, who brings the smile to the utmost sorrowful faces.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>You are the light in my life..</CENTER>
<CENTER>The soul purpose I live..</CENTER>
<CENTER>My missing half.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Without you I'm not whole..</CENTER>
<CENTER>For you are my significant other.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>{Laithia runs off the stage}

<CENTER>You inspire me endlessly</CENTER>
<CENTER>In so many different ways</CENTER>
<CENTER>Giving me strength and encouragement</CENTER>
<CENTER>For each and every day.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>You have shown me a new world
</CENTER>
<CENTER>One filled with laughter and fun
</CENTER>
<CENTER>With new experiences waiting to happen</CENTER>
<CENTER>The excitement has just begun.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>You helped me not to think</CENTER>
<CENTER>And analyze things to an end
</CENTER>
<CENTER>But when things were tougher than expected</CENTER>
<CENTER>You were there to mend.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Fix my problems and my heart</CENTER>

<CENTER>Making life better and secure</CENTER>
<CENTER>While still bring compassion and understanding</CENTER>
<CENTER>And making the way they were</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Back when things were perfect</CENTER>
<CENTER>Days were filled with happiness and joy</CENTER>
<CENTER>Something so meaningful to me</CENTER>
<CENTER>Something I did not want to destroy.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Your love is important to me
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Something I wished to cherish and hold dear</CENTER>
<CENTER>I am sorry for all my mistakes</CENTER>
<CENTER>And hope you'll forgive me, my dear.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>{The End}</CENTER>

<CENTER>Its amazing to think the deepened jags and sorrows..</CENTER>
<CENTER>Of my lifes past..the saddened trails I followed.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>The journey embarked of hardships entrailed..
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Dreams full of joy..debarked and derailed.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I reached out new lands seeking loneliness and solemn</CENTER>
<CENTER>Out to a lake...the Lake of Ill Omen.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>In an afternoon full of clouds</CENTER>
<CENTER>I yell out aloud...</CENTER>
<CENTER>A companion to hunt, to wisk away the pain</CENTER>
<CENTER>Of being lonely in heart...being lonely in vain.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>But tis who I find lying still by the lake...</CENTER>
<CENTER>A cleric of beauty...her blonde hair to sway</CENTER>
<CENTER>in the winds of the lake..such a sight to dismay.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Is so powerful to think such one can show love</CENTER>
<CENTER>To care and to feel the heavens above.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Show mercy on my soul...show power to shun</CENTER>
<CENTER>Tis the day my life changes and forever a new path.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>My lady Laithia has come to my life</CENTER>
<CENTER>Has shown me light within darkness</CENTER>
<CENTER>For the love that she harness</CENTER>
<CENTER>Envelops my soul...touches my fire...</CENTER>
<CENTER>fulfill my desire</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>A smile to my face and I forever embrace</CENTER>
<CENTER>The love that she gives me is glory and grace.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>{The End}</CENTER>

<CENTER>There once was a man of GREAT valor</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who traveled the both near and far</CENTER>
<CENTER>He fought through both valley and dungeon</CENTER>
<CENTER>With greater and greater spoils.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>The weapons and armor were greater</CENTER>
<CENTER>Greater than he ever dreamed</CENTER>
<CENTER>{Gwaltron shows off his new ribcage shield}</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>But when everything comes to close at the days end</CENTER>
<CENTER>None of these make him complete</CENTER>
<CENTER>He tries and tries even harder</CENTER>
<CENTER>To find what he has missed.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>And then he realizes that weapons and armor...</CENTER>
<CENTER>No matter how great!</CENTER>
<CENTER>Can not replace his mates.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>The man in this story is Gwaltron</CENTER>
<CENTER>And the friends he has made are the Waywards.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>{Thank you one and thank you all}</CENTER>

<CENTER>"New Life"</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>I was born again and raced to return to the level that was me</CENTER>
<CENTER>But by the time I did all my friends had leveled times three.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>The beautiful Jacana had gone and made fifty..</CENTER>
<CENTER>Rhogan was off on his quest at Thirty..</CENTER>
<CENTER>Emik Fifty-Three! Oh my! Oh me!</CENTER>
<CENTER>I would catch them all this I decreed.</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>But I'm through with my chase and happier than ever could be</CENTER>
<CENTER>Cause I have new friends who level with or just plain cheer for me..</CENTER>
<CENTER>They are my best and truest friends...</CENTER>
<CENTER>They are you, my guild...you see.</CENTER><BR>
