Well equipped (uber) wizard damage vs. poorly equipped (gimp) wizard damage. &nbsp;The X axis is seconds since the start of the fight, the
Y axis is percent damage increase the uber wizard has over the gimp:

The above wizards have standard raid buffs, i.e. C2, etc., but don't have a bard.

This graph shows wizard damage with a bard, either singing cantana alone, or singing

This graph shows bard usefulness in the above situation, as a percentage
of wizard damage the bard is doing.  Note that the damage shown is
multiplied by the number of wizards in the group, which at max will be 4
(6 person group, -1 for cleric, -1 for bard).&nbsp; Note also that the X
axis is in MINUTES of fight duration.&nbsp; Useful values are generally
those before the 3 minute mark:
