	Armor Lotto Rules</font></h2>

        <h4 align="center"><font face="Garamond">By Thott</font></h4><p>

        <font face="Garamond">These rules apply to non-god/dragon items
	of any kind, but primarily to planar armor.

	<center><h4>Background</h4></center>

        <p>
	If everyone played equally, each item found would be lotto'd and
	given to someone until everyone present has one item, then any
	items dropped thereafter would be given in the same order as before.
	The lotto exists only to determine the initial order, when all those
	present have the same amount of time invested.
	<p>
	Unfortunately, not everyone plays equally.&nbsp; Since in random
	groupings there is no way of knowing who has spent the most time,
	each new group starts over from scratch doing random lottos for
	each item.  Since people come and go, sometimes every item is
	lotto'd across everyone present, even including those that won
	earlier, since the group composition is now different.&nbsp;
	Afterlife can do better than this.

	<center><h4>Theory and Practice</h4></center>

	<p>
	Because we are not a random collection of people, we can
	distribute armor in a fair manner, or at least far more fair
	than a random groups can. &nbsp;To this end we will strive
	to distribute armor based purely on time invested. &nbsp;It
	is up to all those of a given class to pay attention, and to
	<b>know</b> when someone else present has more time invested,
	and to react accordingly by deferring to the older, in terms of
	time invested, player.
	<p>
	In those cases where it can't be determined who has spent the most
	time, the item will be lotto'd amongst those with equivalent times.
	<p>
	It is up to every player to notice and remember the time spent by
	others of the same class.
	<p>
	Time invested, in every place mentioned above, is time invested
	per piece of armor gained. &nbsp;If one player has spent more time,
	but has proportionally more armor, then the two players are equivalent.
	&nbsp;If two have spent equal time and one has 2 more pieces of armor,
	the more armored player would stay out of any lottos until both players
	are equal in armor obtained.
	<p>
	Note that this isn't total armor the player is wearing, this is total
	armor obtained in the same time invested. &nbsp;When comparing two
	players it's quite likely that one had armor before the other started
	going to planes, in which case the time invested counts from that point
	on, ignoring original armor.

	<center><h4>Completing the Set</h4></center>
	<p>
	In any case where the time per armor piece is equivalent, and one
	person has more armor than another, the lesser equipped person
	should stay out.  &nbsp;This is necessary because as a player
	gets more armor, the chances of finding the remaining pieces becomes
	smaller and smaller. &nbsp;
	Note that this is only true when the time invested is equivalent
	or near equivalent.

	<center><h4>Multiple Characters</h4></center>
	<p>
	If a player has more than one character that gets armor in a plane,
	they may win items for either character. &nbsp;The same rules apply
	as above, with armor for both characters counting.
