			<div class="content">After many months of no new interviews, I felt it was time to restart them. The most obvious choice is the new Enchanter Class Rep <span style="color: red">Masuri</span> Enjoy!
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Give us a bit of background on your character please. What server, guild, etc. </span>
<br />
<br />My character is Masuri Sukawa of Povar. I am an officer of Triton (<!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tritonguild.net">http://www.tritonguild.net</a><!-- w --> [not safe for work, not for the easily offended, not tested on animals, void where prohibited]), the ‘uberguild’ of that server. I do recruiting, guildbank, and enchanter class lead stuff, although Triton’s enchanters function as a team and everyone’s opinion is desired. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you end up playing an Enchanter? And does your character name hold any special meaning?</span> 
<br />
<br />I started out as a necromancer on the Xegony server in July of 99, but that got boring fast. A friend of mine told me to start on Povar, and I made, yes, a wood elf druid (at least it wasn’t a Halfling). When Velious came out, my best buds in game were a warrior and a cleric. A druid added no value, so I rolled me up an enchanter and became part of the fabled ‘holy trinity.’ 
<br />
<br />(I ganked my toon's name from the Wheel of Time series, by the way. She's an Aes Sedai.) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What do you like best about playing an Enchanter?</span> 
<br />
<br />It gives me a great measure of control over many situations. Good, bad, or indifferent, it’s up to me how things turn out for my group or my raid. If I suck, we die. If I own, we win. That’s pretty powerful stuff. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone to play in?</span> 
<br />
<br />Plane of Fire. I love pulling there, it’s the best. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">You’ve recently taken over the position of SOE Class Correspondent. Why did you want this position? </span>
<br />
<br />I feel like our class has gotten a little lost during the course of the last few expansions. It seems to me like SOE isn’t quite sure what to do with us, and we, as a class, don’t seem to have a unified message to send regarding what we want them to do with us. I figured I’d take a shot at culling down our wants into something concise and goal-oriented. I’m blunt and to the point – as everyone knows – and maybe that will get us back on track. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What would you like to accomplish in this position? What goals you have set (as the class rep) 6 months from now</span>? 
<br />
<br />I’ve got a few small goals right now in my plan for Enchanter Domination: 
<br />1. Get a dialogue going about our spells, AA, and gameplay. (In progress.) 
<br />2. After a couple of weeks of this, cull some of it down into a few main talking points for each issue. (Upcoming in early November.) 
<br />3. Generate a rough draft of the new Top Ten List for review. (Upcoming in late November.) 
<br />
<br />By December 1, I’d like to have the new top ten list up there and ready to go. And by the end of the 6 month mark (April 17th), I’d like to have everything on that list done and in the game. Then we’d start the process all over again. (I know that’s probably not realistic, but I aim high. It’s my best thing.) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What do you see as an Enchanter’s biggest strength? Do you feel that we live up to our potential?</span> 
<br />
<br />One of the posters on the Runes said that the enchanter was the most diverse of the caster classes, and I think that may be our best thing right now. It used to be immobilizing mobs in one way or another, but now, we’ve been forced to branch out. I’m a tank, a kiter, a puller. I mez, I root, I stun. If there’s something my guild can’t quite figure out how to accomplish, a lot of the time there’s a solution to be found among the enchanter class. 
<br />
<br />As far as potential goes, I think we have a diverse array of useful tools in our arsenal, but I believe that SOE needs to make us more viable in both raid and group content. Encounters need to be more enchanter-friendly. It’s fairly easy to reduce us to a limp DPS class or buff bots in any given encounter, in both raids and groups. Too many mobs with insane resists, mobs with immunity to charm, mez, stun, and root, boss mobs with no adds at all. It sometimes feels like we’re either absolutely required for victory or completely superfluous. A middle ground would be nice. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The Enchanter “Top 10” remains one of the most popular areas on TheRunes.net as well as the Official Sony Boards. From a personal (not as the Liaison) point of view, what would your “Top 10” list look like?</span> 
<br />
<br />This is how it would look: 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">Spells: </span>
<br />
<br />1. A group mana preservation spell. (Someone on here suggested it, and I think it’s a damn good idea.) 
<br />2. A new spell in the rune line. This rune would give us +9 mana regen and also be able to heal itself ala EQ2. 
<br />3. Give sleep, bliss, bliss of the nihil, felicity, wake of felicity, euphoria, and echoing madness a -30 to -50 MR adjustment. 
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">AA: </span>
<br />
<br />4. Have gather mana give you up to 20k mana. 
<br />5. Give Stasis a 12 minute timer instead of a 72 minute timer. (I’d be willing to pay additional AA for this if it was a reduction that could be bought rather than an outright change.) 
<br />6. Create an ability that lets us buy 2% per rank reduction in resists on enthrall spells up to 10% at a cost of 5-10 points per rank. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">General Gameplay: </span>
<br />
<br />7. The majority of both group and raid encounters would have mobs that could be reliably mezzed – by that I mean: 
<br />a. All mezzable mobs would be within the appropriate level range and not have ungodly resists. (These would be mobs you can mez, not mobs that you may be able to mez. ‘Maybes’ are off-tanked by smart guilds/groups.) 
<br />b. Mobs with certain names would always be mezzable (as described above), and mobs with certain names would never be mezzable. (Most of PoP is structured this way.) 
<br />8. Give us a way to deal with mobs that cast but are not mezzable. For example, an unmezzable Ikaav begins to gate or an unmezzable Aneuk begins to cast complete heal. Yes, a melee push might work, but it’d be nice for us to be able to halt that since we are the mana class and it often falls to us to deal with mobs that cast. Maybe an effective mana drain, a fancy new whirl-til-you-hurl spell, or a spell/ability that simply allows an interrupt via 1 second stun (the way we used to use the level 8 nuke back in the day). I don’t care how it’s done but it’d be nice. 
<br />9. Make more mobs stunnable. I know this would be a big deal since paladins and clerics can stun and SOE fears the AE group, but I’d like to see us able to stun effectively to do CC. Color stuns used to be some of our best tools and now they are not viable in almost any situation except a few specifically designed raids. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">Misc:</span> 
<br />10. A new set of party hats. (I can’t think of anything for #10 right now and my best friend suggested this.) 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If a movie were being made about Norrath, what actress would you pick to play you?</span>

<br />Bea Arthur.</div>

			<h3 ><a href="#p112541">Omads Interview</a></h3>
			<p class="author"><img src="./styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />by <strong><span style="color: #AA0000;" class="username-coloured">Juwel</span></strong> on Thu Nov 17, 2005 3:10 pm </p>

			
			<div class="content">This week I interviewed <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">Omad</span> </span> Thank so much!
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us about yourself and your character. How long have you been playing etc?</span>
<br />
<br />Well, my character choice was entirely decided by the friend who got me started. I've been playing for 2 1/2 years now. I play on Tunare but originally from Tallon Zek. When my friend decided to move, he took my newb gear (which you can see on my magelo) and met me on Tunare. I joined a family guild where I learned everything I know about "Enchanting" from Fading Illusion who we all should know  and this is also when I discovered the Runes, and my love for benign trolling. I was sort of a late bloomer. I remember dinging 60 in Noble's Causeway if that gives you a perspective. However now, I'm level 70, with 100 aa's, Time keyed, and elemental flagged, with some GoD flags that I cant keep track of. I'm in Justice League of Norrath and raiding Time weekly. Now a blurb about the name: When I started playing, my character was Fellisha Rashodd, once I got too many m'lady's I decided to re-roll as a guy. The logical choice was Omad Rashodd. Oh, and I have both my 1.0 and 1.5. Thats cool too. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you get started playing EQ and why did you choose an enchanter?</span>
<br />
<br />One day, I was talking to a guy at work about Diablo 2, and he started telling me about Everquest. The idea intrigued me. He told me about PVP, and the classes, etc. The one that intrigued me most was Enchanter. His rational for it, was he wanted free KEI. Go figure . He still plays his now level 66 ranger and boxes a 63 shaman. Sometimes he boxes my cleric too. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your current favorite zone to play in just for fun?</span>
<br />
<br />Well, there are actually two. I always had the most fun playing Omad when I was charm solo'ing. I learned and practiced in Plane of Michief at 57 or 58. I purposly leveled to 64 so that I could do Halls of Honor. At times I miss Hall of Honor, so many AA and I didnt spend enough time there. However the here and now Omad, my favorite zone is the Plane of Time. I like the story behind it, and of course the loot is awesome. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What would you like to see for the game and for enchanters over the next year?</span>
<br />
<br />Content that is not specifically built for us, but considers us durring the development. That and maybe some useful and fun ENC only items. I'm still kind of angry I dont have a Memory or Wand of Tranquility. 
<br />What piece of advice would you give someone starting an enchanter?
<br />Find the way you like to play your enchanter, and go forth and have fun. Advice is hard to give for a new enchanter because of the many ways to play our class. SO find the way you like, and make choices that aid you in that endeavor. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have any special ability from another class what would it be?</span>
<br />
<br />Fading Memories. There have been soooo many times when I wished I had this. With it we would also be more useful as pullers
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If a movie were being made about the world of Norrath, whom would you choose to play you?</span>
<br />
<br />To be honest, the real Ahmad Rashad, Omad's namesake (see above), looks quite a bit like him when he's not in an illusion. I think he'd be pretty good to play me in a movie. If I ever got to meet him, I'd tell him all about the Everquest character that shares his name.</div>

			<div class="content">Decembers Enchanter interview with <span style="color: red">Saediien</span>! Great read <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":)" title="icon_biggrin.gif" />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Give us a bit of background on your character please. What server, guild, etc. </span>
<br />
<br />Saediien, on The Rathe. I had chosen Iluvatri as a surname, but removed it and just became Saediien in late Summer 2004. For most of the time I was playing Everquest, I was a member, then officer, raid officer, and then de facto leader of The Circle of the Golden Dragon, a family guild. My guild dissolved in late Summer 2004. 
<br />
<br />In mid-Summer of 2004, I moved to a different state, took a new job, and got married. That made Everquest a pretty low priority. About the same time, my guild was starting to implode because of an absentee leader and because everytime we thought we were finally getting a critical mass of enough people at the same level to go out and accomplish things, people would leave. Plus, the advent of WoW and EQ2 resulted in even more people departing. Sadly, I fear that was the end of days for me and Everquest--in some way it broke my heart because Everquest was dead to me. When my guild dissolved and my ingame friends left, and then was (and am) married to a beautiful, intelligent, lovely woman who has absolutely zero interest in playing computer games, it became very had to muster up a desire to play anymore, so I mostly stopped. 
<br />
<br />When DoDh came out, I was intrigued at the possibility of playing with old RL friends, the ones who had originally gotten me into Everquest but whom I sadly outleveled and with whom I could no longer group. I reactivated my account a month or so ago, encouraged my RL friends to start playing again, and am currently an applicant to Evolution of Faith, a family/raid guild on my server. Unfortunately, though, my RL friends who got back into EQ at my urging have basically left again. They have busy lives, and EQ is a tough game to play for an hour here and there at level 50 or so and for it be any fun, especially if there are no groups for you to join and you don't have enough ingame friends to be able to put a group together on your own, at least not without waiting for a long time. Also, for me, shrouding a stupid fairy to help out their LDoNs as they tried to level up wasn't very much fun--it was like playing Enchanter, but a really really lame Encahnter! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you end up playing an Enchanter? And does your character name hold any special meaning? </span>
<br />
<br />I can't really answer that question without answering how I started playing EQ. I had a RL friend--one of the friends who briefly came back to EQ recently--who had bugged me for about a year to play this game called "Everquest". I hadn't been very into computer games since college, when I did a fair amount of Starcraft playing, and hadn't really played an RPG since Bard's Tale and Wasteland way back in the day. I of course was totally unfamiliar with the MMORPG thing. From 2002 through 2003, I had a one-year job in a state where I had no desire to live when I was finished. I also had a serious long distance girlfriend. I also worked for the Federal government. As a result, I had a 9-5 job in a place where I didn't know very many people and not a lot of incentive to go out and meet new people. I decided to try out this everquest business. I called my friend, after doing some research on my own, and asked about the different classes. His girlfriend, who also played, was very encouraging about an Enchanter because of their crowd control capacity. I decided to go with it. I fell in love with the game very quickly. I had played various pen &amp; paper games in my youth, and my inner dork quickly flourished with a vengence. I also fell in love with the class, probably dating back to leveling at the Skyfire ramp in The Overthere. I got to do some serious crowd control, and ended up pulling/slowing/mezzing/rooting, which is always fun to do. I never even thought about playing a different class, and never did anything with alts. 
<br />
<br />My name was randomly generated, except that it was "Saedien" or something, which was rejected. I altered to Saediien and it worked. My old surname "Iluvatri" was derived from the Tolkien deity Iluvatar. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What do you see as an Enchanters biggest strength? Do you feel that we live up to our potential? </span>
<br />
<br />For me, playing an Enchanter was always fun because of our ability to control different situations and bring order to chaos. These days, however, I am afraid I'm pretty ignorant of most of what is going on, so I can't honestly say if we are living up to our potential. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone to play in just for fun?</span> 
<br />
<br />Impossible to pick just one. Definitely Old Sebilis, Howling Stones, Grieg's End, Mistmoore, ToFS I have always enjoyed. Old Seb was a lot of fun when I was crawling around in my 50's, ignoring the Planes and enjoying my time with good friends and guildmates. Howling Stones is a fun dungeon too, I'm proud that I finally got a master key to all the doors, though fighting there makes my Worker's Sledgehammer slightly less useful! Grieg's End is just silly. ToFS is always interesting and it is fun to progress towards a goal that gets more and more challenging. Mistmoore is just classically fun. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you give a new enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Are there any new enchanters anymore? Other than twinks? That sounds sarcastic, but honestly I'm currently completely lost in the world of Everquest and I'm level 66. I have absolutely no idea what it would be like to be a new Enchanter starting from scratch, nor what advice would be helpful, other than try to group so you can learn your role, I guess-- that and make sure your RL is unbusy enough that you can devote the sufficiently large amount of time that it takes to make the game tenable as a continuing interest. If you really want to play casually, like a few hours a week, the game is tough. If you are on that line between hardcore and casual, something like a few hours a day most days every week, and more on the weekends, then if you keep up on what people are saying at The Runes, you'll do ok! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Outside of EverQuest, what do you do for fun?</span> 
<br />
<br />I like to read books, and have been playing WoW off and on for about a year now. I was playing on PvE server to about level 35 when I just found that having a wife and a real job etc. made it too difficult to play, plus I didn't have any friends to play with. It was a solitary experience, unlike what made EQ interesting for me for so long. I recently started playing WoW again though, on a PvP server and actually joined the guild Flowers of Happiness as a chance to do something different--and completely juvenile! I suppose I also read MMORPG-related message boards more than I actually play MMORPG's these days, when I have downtime at work. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If a movie were being made about Norrath, what actor would you pick to play you?</span> 
<br />
<br />Well, he would have to be a high elf. Maybe a young Peter O'Toole?</div>

			<div class="content">What a pleasant surprise it was to stumble across this thread today and and see the interview with Saediien. I was also a member of Circle of the Golden Dragon with him and can attest Saed is top shelf. We were not a hard core raiding guild, as you can probably tell by his interview, but we were a pretty tight knit family guild did a lot of group outings, small raids and epics. Saed was always the first to jump in and help anyone in need and was a very skilled player. You couldn't ask for a better guildmate. 
<br />
<br />I left CotGD shortly before its demise to join a guild with some RL friends (Empire of the Forgotten) but always missed Saed and the some of the other great players in that guild.
<br />
<br />Give Saed a /cheer if you ever see him. Truly a shame our paths will probably not cross again.
