</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">Yesterday morning Berek Halfhand (Ogaming/Znetwork), Samanna (Shaman Crucible/Samanna.net) and myself had Lead Designer Travis McGeathy (aka Rashere the Rabid Weasle) all to ourselves for a personal tour of The Serpents Spine, Everquests 12th and hopefully not to be final expansion.
<br />

<br />
The basic layout is there are 13 Brand spanking new zones:
<br />
Crescent Reach (1-20)
<br />
Blightfire Moors (20-40)
<br />
Stone Hive (30-50)
<br />
Goru`kar Mesa (40-60)
<br />
Blackfeather Roost (50-70)
<br />
The Steppes (55-75)
<br />
Icefall Glacier (65+)
<br />
Valdeholm (70+)
<br />
Frostcrypt, Throne of the Shade King (70+ Raids)
<br />
Sunderock Springs (55-75)
<br />
Vergalid Mines (65+)
<br />
Direwind Cliffs (70+)
<br />
Ashengate, Reliquary of the Scale (70+ Raids)
<br />

<br />
Highhold Pass has undergone a massive revamp
<br />

<br />
Now you may be curious why my addled brain has chosen to order the zones as such, well for those of you who remember Dragons of Norrath and Velious there are two very distinctive paths.
<br />

<br />
The expansion is nestled within the Serpentspine Mountains, a range of mountains that runs in the center of Antonica.This area of the expanion used to be ruled over by giants and ogres back before the Raellosian wars and the invasion of the planes. Great civilizations rose and fell in this time and for the most part had closed their borders until recently.
<br />

<br />
What changed all of this was the creation of the Drakkin race.Mortals since the elder age and much before have been indiscrimitly destroying the dragon races, invading their nesting grounds, and pillaging their holy temples and cities. Six elder dragons chose to break from the wisdom of the Scale and Claw of Veeshan to create a race of gaurdians to protect the future of Dragonkind...The six dragons in the Circle:Venesh the Greenblood (green); Draton`ra, Master of the Void (black); Keikolin, Bringer of Enlightenment (gold); Mysaphar, Seeker of All (white/silver); Atathus the Red Lord (duh); and Osh`vir the Windspirit (blue).
<br />

<br />
These dragons formed their own council and travelled across norrath selecting (in the case of the evil dragons kidnapping) humans to form this new race of theirs, and chose Nokk an ancient city of ogres from before the curse that made them into the semi-intelligent race of today and built a new foundation of civilization called Crescent Reach.
<br />

<br />
Crescent Reach (CR) is the heart of this expansion, with several hundred quests revolving around here. Players of any race/class combination may choose to start here, and Drakkins may choose to be any class but Beastlords, Berserkers and Shaman (this is subject to change).
<br />

<br />
Players are intended to play the tutorial before moving on to CR but it is not neccesary as there are a plethora of newbie training yards, guildmasters, spell merchants and more. In addition all of the tradeskill mastery quests as well as newbie introduction quests for tradeskilling have been ported to CR. All players who wish to find a home in CR may do so, but must begin by introducing themselves to the ruling Drakkin council, and beginning to build a reputation and loyalty among the various factions located here (somewhat similar to EQ2). This is taken a step further if you are a Drakkin and may develop various racial abilities once you have become famous enough to take on quests personally for your Dragon patron.There is a tremendous amount of the small details that are designed to bring CR to life and more are added every day, from drunken dwarves to jealous brothers there is literally a novella worth of stories here. 
<br />

<br />
One of the nicer features of this expansion is that there are many model revamps including oozes, bears, spectres and more that will echo across all of Everquest.There is also enough content that players may experience from 1-75 and never need leave the expansion, with quests and hunting ground for all the levels between.It is also the most ambitious expansion ever with almost 70k words of just storyline/lore (with a new delievery mechanic), 500+ quests, almost 1400 PC+NPC spells/effects, several thousand items and more spiders then you can shake a giant's shoe at.
<br />

<br />
The zones themselves are all on the scale of Wall of Slaughter or larger, to include ones that are not only flat, but move into the Z plane as you ascend.There is a good mix of outdoor zones as well as dungeons with most content being set firmly in non-instanced zones. 
<br />

<br />
Blightfire Moors is located just outside of CR and is the origin of the curse that afflicts the giants who attempted to overthrow Rallos Zek after his failed foray into the Plane of Earth. Permanently overcast, undead abound here as well as old temples and buildings from a bygone age.Light plays an important part of this zone and the events located here.
<br />

<br />
There are group and multi-group events for lower level players as well as large tracts of camping and mini-dungeons located in caves throughout.Gnolls, Goblins, Giants, Undead, Witches, Oozes, Animals you name it and they live here.The swamp areas between the fog, environmental sounds, witches, and overcast skys are quite the experience, and if your not careful you will get seperated from your group even if they are mere feet away as you sink to your doom in the marshes.
<br />

<br />
Past the marshes and through the swamps we arrive at one of the most beautiful zones ever to be created for the Everquest IP, Stone Hive, the land of the Bixies. This is a level 30 to 50 dungeon and home to the newly evolved bixie race.There are 3 primary areas (center, above and below) as well as outdoor areas for hunting and exploring.This zone has several distinct areas that lend themselves to groups camping and being able to pull a wide variety of mini-named monsters.
<br />

<br />
Beyond the Bixies is Goru Kar Mesa, home to the Satyrs, Centaurs and other Fey races.This is a very important zone in the expansion where players must first begin to choose as the expansion branches into two seperate paths, one that leads up a glacier and the other towards a volcano (one towards freedom and the other towards an opressive regime,run by Dynleth bent on capturing slaves for his army and holding a holy relic, the Scale of Veeshan, and corrupting the very land with his Volcano, what will be the future of Dragon-kind). This zone is also the Buffet for the nearby griffins and harpies in the Roost. There are also many dangerous environmental factors here that players must be mindful of or risk a grisly death, this becomes even more important and deadly the deeper you venture into the expansion. One of the most memorable areas in this zone is the Tree of Life, it is here that hope resides for the Drakkin.
<br />

<br />
The Roost is home to Harpies, Griffins, and Soldiers... much like the ascent you move from area to area as you work your way up, do not fall, do not get picked up by a harpy and thrown to your death... its a long walk back.
<br />
This is a good place to mention a new death mechanic (similar to EQ2) in which you die and remain at your corpse with the option to return to your bindpoint or wait for a resurrection, the fact that forced zoning has been removed speeds up gameplay significantly and will be a boon to raider and group-player alike. There are several interactive objects (nests) here that you can destroy that will summon monsters (it kind of reminds me of Gauntlet) and make great experience camps with named mobs and all. To access the higher (and more rewarding areas) players must complete quests to use the griffin transporters as you move through the three plateuas and finally the Queens roost.
<br />

<br />
Heading further up the Glacier you arrive in The Steppes, the steppes here are cut by an ancient glacier that has receeded to the north and youll find that the zone slows upwards are you head north.
<br />

<br />
This branch of the expansion deals with the story of the giants and their curse.When The Rathe cursed the giants, there was one sect that managed to avoid the curse because they didnt join in the fight, these giants retain their intellect and live in a city to the north called Valdeholm, but suffer under a curse of their own, Rallos has his own cursed involved here, though...for their cowardice, Rallos cursed the Krithgor (the giants here) and when they die, they rise again as shades whose only purpose is to destroy their former friends and family. The Krithgor pretty much keep to Valdeholm these days...venturing beyond it draws the attention of the shades.Giants, Shades, Wolves, Orcs, Goblins and more abound here and the tunnels are very dangerous.
<br />

<br />
Icefall Glacier holds the distinction of being where the invasion to the Plane of Earth took place, the remains of the portal play a key role in this zone.More of the Goblinoid/Giant races and their servants abound as well as a cold expanses reminscent of Velious.
<br />

<br />
Valdeholm, the Giant city overlooks a giant iceflow that covers the remains of the endzone Frostcrypt.In front of the city are the Wraithguard, outcasts of the Krithgor who hold the line against the shades of Zek. This is a 70+ outdoor dungeon containing the Kirthgor and their pets.
<br />

<br />
Frostcrypt, Throne of the Shade King is the endzone for half of the expansion...frostcrypt is both an end game dungeon and a raid zone...similar to dreadspire, the raid zone is instanced while the dungeon is static. The front area of the zone is largely mindless undead while the shades, the true terrors, make their home deeper inside.
<br />

<br />
Moving to the other path Sunderock Springs begins our journey toward the volcano and is the other half of the main storyline. This side of the story centers around Dynleth, a half-dragon/half-elf who controls an artifact of veeshan and lords over this domain, hes raising an army for conquest and enslaving Drakkin to his cause. Geothermal fissures and springs are dangerous to players so be warned.
<br />

<br />
The Vergalid Mines lay underneath the Springs towards the cliffs, this mine fuels Dynleths war machine and is manned largely by slaves, both giant and Drakkin.Those drakkin touched by the red or black dragons are evil and willing participants in dynleths army, the blue and green are the neutral dragons and youll find some of them willing and some slaves, silver and gold make up the good dragons and are hard to turn to slavery. More mini-named as well as the global rare drops.At the bottom of the mines lay Vergalid himself, he was one of the guardians of the scale that Dynleth now controls and was injured during solusek ros upheavel of these mountains, he lay trapped under rocks for years, being mentally tortured by Lethar, another guardian of the scale (and eventual father of Dynleth) who wanted control of the scale himself.
<br />

<br />
Direwind Cliffs is the ascent to Ashengate, like Frodo climbing mount doom, ash hangs heavy in the air and the burning skies... this is the staging area for Dynleths army. This area has been devastated by the corruption coming down from the volcano so is pretty much dead and undead.
<br />

<br />
Ashengate, Reliquary of the Scale and final endzone along this storyline.It is very reminiscent of the Temple of Veeshan, although there is some structural damage from when Solusek Ro raised the mountains and destroyed the forests. One of the important features in the west hall is the Tears of the Betrayed, he lava flowing from the eyes of the dragon is based off the guardians that Lethar killed to gain control of the scale. In the central hall is a gift from Queen Veeshan to her brood, a single scale that occupies most of this vaulted room with a honor gaurd of Drakkin, it holds a power over dragons that Lethar and Dynleth have used.
<br />

<br />
TSS will also host a number of new changes to design and aquisition such as the spell system. We will be experimenting with Spell Ranks (much like EQ2) in which the base spell for core/critical spells are easily obtained perhaps through a vendor or a common drop or easy quest, but there are upgrades to said spell through harder means that increase the power of said spell.
<br />

<br />
Character creation has also been revamped and is much smoother to use, many of the promised changes on eqlive such as the downtime system and spell resist systems will be revamped and the new Con system that will allow dark blues to be more readily identified.
<br />

<br />
Thanks again to Rashere and the rest of the SOE Staff who made this tour possible, for those of you in beta, keep up the hard work and feedback and I look forward to seeing this most ambitious expansion forever change Everquest.
<br />

</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">Jonric: What are you adding in the way of new spells? Why was this an area you chose to focus on in this expansion? What are some interesting or unusual new examples?
<br />

<br />
David Ford: Just like with Alternate Advancement abilities, it's too soon to discuss specific spells because the details will change so greatly between now and the launch of the expansion. One thing that I can talk about is a new way that spell upgrades will happen. We now have the ability to create spell groups. Spells in a group are basically tiered versions of the same spell. So, you might have four versions of Giant Flame Ball of Doom, each better than the one that came before. If you get the next version of a spell you already have, it will replace the previous version in your spell book.
<br />

<br />
    The chat channels can be an excellent source to find out what the average EverQuest player is doing and talking about, and I've definitely made fixes and changes based on what I've run into or talked about in-game
<br />

<br />
This allows us to make the base version of the spell available fairly easily (vendor purchased, a simple solo quest, etc.), and make the more powerful versions available in appropriate content. A spell with three tiers might see a solo quest, a group quest and a raid to get all of the versions.
<br />

<br />
There are several other improvements to the spells system that I'd love to talk about here, but the details will have to wait until we get closer to launch.
<br />

<br />
Jonric: Will there be many new items such as weapons, armor, etc? What are some interesting ones players can expect to see?
<br />

<br />
 	
<br />
 
<br />
 
<br />
David Ford: Visually speaking, there are a number of really great looking held items that will be found in The Serpent's Spine. One I really like is a Lava dagger that has flowing magma that runs through the blade itself.
<br />

<br />
We will be itemizing the expansion from level 1 onward, so there really won't be any type of item that exists in EverQuest that you can't find somewhere in this expansion. Not to say that every item will be duplicated, but the variety will be quite large.
<br />

<br />
Jonric: Which aspects of The Serpent's Spine were most influenced by community feedback? What kind tends to be most helpful, and how much do you actively solicit it, particularly from the silent majority?
<br />

<br />
 	
<br />
 
<br />
 
<br />
David Ford: I think the overall direction of the expansion was influenced by a lot of community feedback and our sense of what the game needed right now. We felt that what EverQuest really needed was a new starting point, a location for new and old players to meet together and experience great content.
<br />

<br />
All feedback is helpful, but some, of course, is more so. Players who use our message boards to post well reasoned and calm descriptions of the parts of the game they feel strongly about, positively or negatively, are a great resource for us to find out what we're doing right and wrong. Our beta process is the place where feedback on an expansion is sought, and I think that our beta testers generally do a really good job of communicating with us so we have a good dialogue. I think the in-beta communication has been steadily increasing through the past few expansions, and I'm looking forward to a very productive beta cycle for The Serpent's Spine. I have a few ideas already for how to get everyone involved in testing and tuning the portions of the content I'll be responsible for perfecting over the next few months.
<br />

<br />
As to the silent majority, just speaking for myself, I often seek feedback pretty silently. I try to be in-game on my play account as often as I can, and hopefully, I'll be online for at least an hour or so most days, even if I'm doing nothing other than watching the text scroll by. The chat channels can be an excellent source to find out what the average EverQuest player is doing and talking about, and I've definitely made fixes and changes based on what I've run into or talked about in-game on my play account.
<br />

<br />
Jonric: With many other choices available, what keeps people playing EverQuest for the long-term, and how will The Serpent's Spine strengthen the game in this regard?
<br />

<br />
David Ford: In addition to the community ties that I mentioned before, one thing that really sets EverQuest apart is the sheer volume of content available. I can't think of any other game that offers as many ways for a player to adventure and grow their character, and I think that's a prime reason that a lot of players stick around for as long as they do. A lot of players have to-do lists a mile long that they'd love to accomplish. It would be very hard to run out of fun things to do in EverQuest.
<br />

<br />
    I am very impressed by what this team has put together for this expansion. There are so many things I've seen people on this team do for this expansion that have made me stop and marvel
<br />

<br />
The Serpent's Spine will add a lot of content and, I'll go so far as to say a lot of good content to the game. I'm really excited to see the spheres of influence and destructible objects that debuted in Prophecy of Ro mature and find hosts of applications in this expansion. We have, on numerous occasions, managed to do things with this game that have never been done before by leveraging the features and tools that have been created over the years. I think that for a lot of players, playing through this expansion will be characterized by a lot of &quot;Wow, I didn't know they could do that!&quot; moments.
<br />

<br />
Jonric: To complement the previous question, what kind of gamer who isn't currently playing EverQuest would benefit by trying it instead of other alternatives?
<br />

<br />
 	
<br />
 
<br />
 
<br />
David Ford: There are a lot of current EverQuest players who, before picking up the game, would have never thought that a game like it could appeal to them. I had never played anything remotely like this game when I started in 1999, but I found and still find it to be a magical experience.
<br />

<br />
The wealth of content can sometimes be daunting for new players who look at the game, and that's why The Serpent's Spine, with its content progression paths and fresh starting point, represents a great opportunity for anyone who's ever thought of playing EverQuest or is seeing it for the first time.
<br />

<br />
Jonric: To wrap up this lengthy and informative introduction to The Serpent's Spine, do you have any final comments to leave with our readers?
<br />

<br />
 	
<br />
 
<br />
 
<br />
David Ford: The main features of this expansion are, of course, the new race - the Drakkin - the increased level cap and the new Alternate Advancement points that will be available to players. What we also have is a series of refinements to existing features that really add a new layer of depth and polish to existing game systems. We have, on countless occasions when creating this expansion, gone to our coders and asked for this improvement here, that script command there, that all add up to new tricks we can use to make even better content for this expansion.
<br />

<br />
I'd like to close by saying how very excited I am about this product. I am very impressed by what this team has put together for this expansion. There are so many things I've seen people on this team do for this expansion that have made me stop and marvel, and I've come up with some content that I just cant wait to start taking players through in our beta cycle and beyond when the expansion launches.
<br />

<br />
Thank you for the opportunity to answer these questions and share a little bit of our excitement about EverQuest: The Serpent's Spine. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">My only concern for the EQ2 system (played it for a year and had a level 60 Sage), is that there were levels of upgrades.  The upgrades were a mix of droppable common upgrades, and CRAFTED very good upgrades.  The BEST upgrades were extremely rare and dropped.
<br />

<br />
The spell/skill power scale is as such in EQ2:
<br />
(weak) Apprentice I - received automatically through level 50
<br />
(weak) Apprentice II - Purchased or crafted - all levels
<br />
(weak) Apprentice III &amp; IV - crafted only
<br />

<br />
(normal) Adept I - dropped only (very common for certain spells/skills - others were never seen)
<br />
Adept II - does not exist
<br />
(very powerful) Adept III - Crafted Only
<br />
Adept IV - does not exist
<br />

<br />
(ubah) Master 1 - Named/raid dropped only
<br />
(beyond ubah)  Master III - never knew anyone ot have one, but they were supposed to be in the game when I quit playing
<br />

<br />
Note: This was as of January 2006 when I quit playing EQ2, thus they might have actually added the other Adept spells.  The Adept III spells/skill were the main power level of the common non-raider.  The components to make the Adept III spells were rare and expensive, thus most people would only make their most important spells/skills Adept III.  Also the items needed to make the Adept III items were RARE harvests from nodes.  Getting htem didn't take fighting - it just took persistance to sit and harvest nodes over and over.  So a non-raider could get all their Adept III spells, though Masters were generally out of reach.
<br />

<br />
This was generally VERY well balanced.  Everyone wanted the Master spells, but they were not SO much more powerful than the Adept III's, that one couldn't live without them.  I never had any Masters on my Conjuror, and I was able to solo easily with him because I had my Adept III pets and pet buffs. The rest didn't really matter.
<br />

<br />
Thus my concern for EQ1 is the balance.  The lower power versions of spells in EQ1 were almost useless, the mid power spells were usually adequate UNLESS it was a critical spell such as a summoners pet.  This was generally well balanced, as one would spend their cash on their critical spells and just go with low level versions for the rest.  Since spells aren't crafted in EQ1, my concern is the balance for non-raiders to get their spells.  EQ1 doesn't have the same tradeskill system as EQ2, thus how to make spells ranks available through persistance and not require raiding?
<br />

<br />
Thus I want ot hear how the acquisition of the spells will be balanced, and if they intend to retrofit this to the old EQ1 spell system.  And if they do that, all I can say is WOW - that is a HUGE change.
<br />

<br />
If it aint broke don't fix it.  <span style="font-weight: bold">I have no faith that the EQLive team can introduce an entirely new spell system and balance it.</span>  I don't want EQ1 to be like EQ2 where I played an ENTIRELY different game every month (literally) because the Dev's changed the game so much with every patch.<br />_________________<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Mezrin Kortex</span> 70 BeDaZzLeR <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=605959&amp;resize=true" target="_blank" class="postlink">Profile</a></span>  &lt;---Guild Leader of <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://www.asa-tru.com" target="_blank" class="postlink">Asa-Tru</a></span>

<br />

<br />
So, let's look at SOE's existing implementation of spell teirs in EQ:
<br />

<br />
Wizard &quot;max level fire nukes&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Using L 65 &quot;base&quot; fire nuke as the base, we have:
<br />

<br />
L 60 base: 0.66 DPS, 0.7 cost, 0.94 efficiency
<br />
L 60 upgrd: 0.73 DPS, 0.75 cost, 0.97 efficiency
<br />

<br />
L 65 base: 1.0 DPS, 1.0 cost, 1.0 efficiency
<br />
L 65 upgrd: 1.1 DPS, 1.1 cost, 1.0 efficiency
<br />
L 65 ancient: 1.2 DPS, 1.2 cost, 1.0 efficiency
<br />

<br />
L 70 base: 1.4 DPS, 1.25 cost, 1.12 efficiency
<br />
L 70 ancient: 1.5 DPS, 1.33 cost, 1.13 efficiency
<br />
L 70 boom: 2.13 DPS, 2.42 cost, 0.88 efficiency
<br />

<br />
So I could imagine:
<br />
T0: free: 1.6 DPS, 1.4 cost, 1.14 efficiency, -10 resist adjust
<br />
T1: easy: 1.75 DPS, 1.5 cost, 1.17 effieiency, -15 resist adjust
<br />
T2: hard: 1.9 DPS, 1.6 cost, 1.19 efficiency, -20 resist adjust
<br />
T3: &quot;ancient&quot; 2.1 DPS, 1.75 cost, 1.2 efficiency, -25 resist adjust
<br />

Mehhh... This is EQ1 you're talking about, I think judging by past experience from previous spells and expansions you're much too optimistic. IMHO, the casual non-raider versions will be pretty gimp compared to the raiding versions.
<br />

<br />
My prediction:
<br />
Just a guess off your table mind you -
<br />
T0: free: 1.6 DPS, 1.4 cost, 1.14 efficiency 
<br />
T1: easy: 1.75 DPS, 1.5 cost, 1.17 effieiency
<br />
T2: hard: 2.0 DPS, 1.6 cost, 1.19 efficiency, -15 resist adjust
<br />
T3: &quot;ancient&quot; 2.15 DPS, 1.75 cost, 1.2 efficiency, -25 resist adjust
<br />

<br />
I'd adjust the &quot;free&quot; (tradable/vendor) spell DPS and efficiency a LOT lower down the line. The thing about EQ1 is that the devs are always pushing people towards the raiding spectrum of the game - hence, casuals don't really need resist adjustments.
<br />

<br />
PS: 
<br />
I used to play a raider, I am a &quot;casual&quot; now. This sort of stuff is usually heavily balanced towards the raider end. All IMHO predictions and the usual disclaimer - Your Mileage may vary. Casuals don't get your hopes up too high over this expansion.
