			<div class="content">This week we interview <span style="color: red">Badgerous </span>of the Bristlebane server!
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How were you introduced to EverQuest? </span>
<br />
<br />A friend at work introduced me in mid 1999, and I started a human enchanter character. Having gotten lost about a zillion times in freeport and killed by the guards almost as much, and being bored of only being able to see 30 metres in the dark, I recreated as a High Elf (Badgerous Facraque). If only I'd read the creation guides - I'm a devout follower of Tunare (which has caused no end of grief!) even though I've killed her enough times (including getting the kill shot once!) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have a spell or ability line from another class, what would it be?  </span>
<br />
<br />Hmm, tricky one. Pre-PoP I'd've said ports... Pre-level 61, I would have said 'heals!' but since Arcane Rune (and later Eldritch Rune) unless I've done something entirely dim (often!) I don't need heals. I'd probably plump for snare nowadays, which would make charm soloing that bit easier. Though realisitically without a snaring partner charming would get boring very quickly. Feign Death would be nice too I suppose... 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What would you say is your most rewarding accomplishment to date?  </span>
<br />
<br />
<br />My Epic! More specifically the hours spent in the Plane of Hate without actually throwing my mouse through my monitor in frustration! If it wasn't for the support of friends (and, at the end, a day off work boxing a duoed wizard to help) I would have given up a long time ago. Nothing beat the satisfaction of handing in the last piece and getting my Snakey....and then immediately aggroing and slaying Jeb Lumsed for inflicting the hours of torment upon me! Though I must say I had it lucky, parsing my logs afterwards the EoV dropped on the 109th revenant - many people have had to be even more patient, and I salute them! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />If you could be a developer for a day, what would you do with your Gawd-like powers? </span> 
<br />
<br />
<br />Where to start?! Make the EoV drop that bit more often!! I guess I'd try and sort out the (alledged!) platinum duplication bug that seems to have sent bazaar prices skyrocketing on all servers too. 
<br />
<br />As a programmer myself, I'd love to have a go at speeding up EQ's graphics system -- it seems to lag out far too easily no matter how fast your PC and graphics card is! I'm sure there's something that could be done to make it quicker. 
<br />
<br />On a more trivial note I'd add it so EQ actually remembered if I had channel announcements on (/announce) so I didn't have to type it in every time!! Another niggler; why is it that some spell messages seem to get lost at a distance? If you cast some spells at max range you get no 'blah blah begins to drool', though you still get a message if the spell was resisted! Why!?!? I always panic at that point! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie based on EQ, who would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />Rick Moranis!</div>

			<div class="content">Since this week is Reganes Birthday, I thought it would provide the perfect opportunity to interview her <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":)" title="icon_biggrin.gif" /> I introduce you all to <span style="color: red">Regane</span> of the Veeshan server. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your Enchanter. Server, level, guild... stuff like that.</span> 
<br />I am a level 61 dark elf with 12 aa points now, residing on the Veeshan server. My guild is Rage Veeshan, a small, mostly high level casual guild. We raid about once or twice a week which is fine with me because I don't like raiding much. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you get started playing EQ and how long have you been playing? </span>
<br />I got started in July of 2001. My (now ex) boyfriend had gotten introduced to the game by his cousin, and he spent most of the summer playing it instead of paying attention to me. Well this pissed me off, and he constantly tried to get me to play it but I refused because it looked boring and repetitive. Then I finally gave in, because I was in the middle of moving and all my stuff was in boxes, and I had nothing to do. I started a wood elf druid on his account, and within a few hours I was a full fledged addict. I've taken breaks from time to time (mostly for school) but I got the druid to level 60 before switching my focus to my enchanter and my cleric (level 61). And yes they're all on the same account! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you give a new Enchanter?</span> 
<br />Don't allow yourself to be a buff bitch. Use your powers to their fullest, and don't be afraid of death. Don't run from trains, chase them and master them. Mem multiple AE stuns, and enjoy them while you can. Oh and get lots of hp gear! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd-like powers? </span>
<br />Well first I would decrease the casting time of color cloud to 1.5 seconds and decrease the mana cost to 250. Not that I have this spell yet but I have a hard time channeling 2 second stuns as it is. Then I would decrease the base duration of KEI to 80 mins to match the upgrades. Finally I would increase the drop rate of EVERYTHING in Hate. Epic drops, marsinger quest, etc. That zone is just rediculous. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What would you say has been your greatest accomplishment since creating your enchanter?</span> 
<br />Pretty much any time 5+ mobs run into camp and I manage to mez them all before anyone gets killed. That gives me the best feeling. Another time in particular was when my guild was doing Chardok royals and somehow we managed to pull 16 or so mobs. Luckily I had my ae stuns up and I kept them all locked down while the guild killed. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What keeps you interested in EQ? </span>
<br />Honestly it's grouping with my friends. The game itself is pretty repetitive, and it takes forever to accomplish anything. But I love going out with a group of friends/guildies to a dungeon somewhere and taking risks and pushing ourselves. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If a movie were being made about Everquest, whom would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />That's a hard one because I can't think of anyone offhand who'd make a good dark elf. Personality wise, someone sexy but who's not afraid to get right into the fray of the fight.</div>

<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your Enchanter. Server, level, guild... stuff like that. </span>
<br />
<br />65 Dark elf (the best, right Juwel?  ) On Bristlebane, unguilded atm 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you get started playing EQ and how long have you been playing?</span> 
<br />
<br />A RL friend of my ex plays (Hi Hopperr on BB), and we went on a weekend vacation to see him. Needless to say, he played a bit while we were there, and got both of us interested. Got home and got EQ.. thats all it took! Been playing since early 2001.

<br />Hmm I like my chanter mostly the way she is, but having played a druid from the beginning, I think snare would be very handy. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Was there a defining moment that you feel in love with your Enchanter, or was it more of a gradual appreciation? </span>
<br />
<br />I think the big moment for me was way back in LOIO, having someone pull a mob of sarnaks out and locking them down with AE mez. Just seemed very cool to me, and fun.  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd-like powers? </span>
<br />
<br />I'd bring world peace.. oh wrong question. Hm let's see.. I don't think every class issue is easily solvable, so going with my true nature I think I'd just have a big goofy party and try to make everyone laugh somehow. 
<br />(my fondest GM event memory is the giant snow bunnies in EW. I laughed my butt off that day) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What would you say has been your greatest accomplishment since creating your enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Not sure about greatest accomplishment, I'm not 'uber' by any means, or a big raider. Some of my favorite times are helping people out with combines on spells theyve been dying for, or making stat jewelry for lowbies, or even just sitting and buffing Newbies while they struggle to level. Not a great accomplishment, but it works for me  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you think you will be trying EQ2? </span>
<br />I may, but I have fun playing EQ. The graphics look awesome for EQ2, and some neat ideas. So I might have to check it out. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If a movie were being made about Everquest, whom would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />Hmm lacking any actresses I know that are blue, I think I'll go with Angelina Jolie, simply because she's one of my favorite actresses and she's a very honest, fun person. 
<br />
<br />With that over.. I think I must go find Juwel online and beat her</div>

			<div class="content">This week we interview <span style="color: red">Remelio</span> of Tarew Marr!
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your Enchanter. Server, level, guild... </span>
<br />
<br />Well I hail from Tarew Marr, I'm a 65 High Elf Enchanter, although I spend most of my time in either Vah Shir or Guktan form. My guild is called Transcendence and I'm the guildleader. We're a little small but I've been trying to work on that lately  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you get started playing EQ and how long have you been playing? </span>
<br />
<br />Well I heard about the game from one of my gaming magazines and went and applied to beta a long time ago. Finally I got entered into Phase 4 beta but I didn't start playing much until very late in the beta. It was enough for me to fix a few bugs and get hooked. I bought the game about a week after it came out and haven't turned back since! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have ability or spell line from another class what would it be?</span> 
<br />
<br />Hrm this is a toughie. I'd probably go with Eye of Tallon - the improved Eye of Zomm. Being able to scout into a room without walking in there would be great for targeting. If not that then the ranger version of tracking. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd-like powers? </span>
<br />
<br />I'd fix that stupid missing 1 pixel from the bottom of the chat window for starters  Hrm what else. Probably sit down and fix the issues with deception so it can go live, and give enchanters a spell Illusion: Evil Eye, and make Illusion: Werewolf turn you into one of the werewolves from PoN. I have a one track mind I guess  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What would you say has been your greatest accomplishment since creating your enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Not really any single accomplishment per-se but being a guildleader and an enchanter has been a blast. Leading raids and living through that inevitable overpull near chardok royals (I think everybody here knows the one) is just such a good feeling. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone to play in for pure FUN factor? </span>
<br />
<br />Before the faction nerf I would have said the Hole hands down. Haven't really been back there recently though. Anywhere out of the way and off the "normal" zones is fun though. I like crawling around in places few people have ever been like the tower full of sirens in Sirens Grotto. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you think you will be trying EQ2?</span> 
<br />
<br />It doesn't really look like my style of game, but I'll probably give it a try. If nothing else I want to see what they have in store for the EQ2 UI  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If a movie were being made about Everquest, whom would you pick to play you?</span> 
<br />
<br />To play me, the player, I'd get Kevin Smith. We look enough alike, and he's just cool. To play the character Remelio, since I'm in Vah Shir form all the time it wouldn't really matter that much who they got to play me. I'd probably pick someone cool like Patrick Stuart or Sean Connery

			<div class="content">This week I interviewed <span style="color: red">Adreanne</span> of the Luclin Server.. (sorry I lost your last interview, thanks for resending it to me!)
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your Enchanter. Server, level, guild ... </span>
<br />
<br />Luclin Server, been here for over 3 years. 62 going on 65 * got next friday saturday and sunday off... No sleep for me!* 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you get started playing EQ and how long have you been playing? </span>
<br />
<br />Actually bought the game 2 weeks after it came out... My computer was a pile of junk and couldn't handle it, a year later my computer could handle it but thought it to be dumb to pay again to play a game I bought a year ago. 
<br />
<br />Then met up with this guy at a friends house who used to play EQ in college. He gave me his RL friends twink account that was stripped and no one had intrest in... There was a L29 enchanter on there *OMFG L29!?! No way! I'm gonna be like a god when I log her on* Any ways long story short. After the original owner relized his account was getting attention and had a higher level enchanter on there, I guess he wanted it back *Enc Loss #1* 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you give a new Enchanter?</span> 
<br />Keep up to date with every spell you own what it does, /autojoin SW.Enchanter and ask questions and read chat. As well as bookmark the runes. One of the most helpful things to me ever was the serverwide chat. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd-like powers?</span> 
<br />
<br />Multi - Classing drr!! 65/65 Pal/Enc would be a god! As well as make NO MORE RARE EFFIN DROPS OR SPAWNS!! Unholy christ that would makes players alot less tense about stuff. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What goals do you have for your character over the next 6 months or so?</span> 
<br />
<br />Sleepers Key, Veeshans Peaks Key, Vex Thall Key, Kill quarm, Kill gnomes, reach 5,000hp unbuffed. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What keeps you interested in EQ</span>? 
<br />
<br />lol, it's pretty cheap entertainment and twice as addictive as herion. I love the interacting with thousands of other playes world wide to accomplish hard tasks. Like raiding. Everquest isn't really a game. It's more of a community of people who you know share ATLEAST one thing in common with. You can grow very tight relationships with people, and possibly better than you can in real life
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If a movie were being made about Everquest, whom would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />John Goodman in a dress, he's a funny guy.</div>

			<div class="content">This week I interviewed <span style="color: red">Drilynus</span> of Prexus.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your Enchanter. Server, level, guild... stuff like that. </span>
<br />
<br />My enchanter's full name is Drilynus Aeternus. He is a level 65 Enchanter of Innoruuk (man that hurt me in the early levels! &gt;_&lt;) I play on the Prexus Server, and I'm a member of a guild called Keepers of the Faith. Until two weeks ago I had never trained dodge - a GM actually allowed me to have an extra training point to start off the skill lol! This was my first character, and I only knew one person in game, and it was a level 21 druid, so I only learned things as I went along. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you get started playing EQ and how long have you been playing?</span> 
<br />
<br />I got started playing EQ after a very good friend and Clanmate of mine in Team Fortress Classic told me "Join EQ! No lagging sniper dots!" That was over three years ago, September 1999. Long time, lots of memories! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have ability or spell line from another class what would it be?</span> 
<br />
<br />A snare. Definitely a snare spell. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Was there a defining moment that you feel in love with your Enchanter, or was it more of a gradual appreciation? </span>
<br />
<br />A definite moment. Back when Kunark was the expansion to have, and Sebilis was the place to experience, my group was down in Necro camp. Pull went bad and we had to succor. But no way in hell were we losing that named! So we trained back to Necro, and brought about 7 frogs to a respawning camp. Go go Dazzle with its long refresh time, I managed to lock everything down! Lammy dropped, won the random but gave it to our group's warrior, who immediately equipped it ^_^ 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd-like powers? </span>
<br />
<br />I'd go through the enchanter's spellbook, delete half the useless spells we have, get rid of pet animations, give lower levels a much more stable charm spell, and make an AA area stun with a 10 minute refresh time that was instant cast (but not unresistable, that's be too powerful). Don't worry! Umbra would be preserved  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone to play in for pure FUN factor?</span> 
<br />
<br />Plane of Water, in my little niche I found : ) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you think you will be trying EQ2? </span>
<br />Absolutely not. It's way different than EQ1. I'm having a blast in the game now! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If a movie were being made about Everquest, whom would you pick to play you?</span> 
<br />
<br />Hmm...Ed Norton, for sure.</div>

			<div class="content">Finally someone let me interview them! This week it's <span style="color: red">Ootpek of Xev</span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your character. Server, guild, anything you want us to know. </span>
<br />Ootpek Ubiqitous is a level 65 enchanter of Xev with a long history. Started in April of 2000 he's been around for over 150 days of playtime. His name I've been using in various games over many years now but when I first created it, I bashed both keys on the keyboard and came up with "OTPK". Add a couple vowels and VOILA! Ootpek was born! 
<br />
<br />Since then he's been a lasertag master, a passable FPS'er, a world champ at Clusterball, and even climbed the yahoo cribbage ladder to the top 100 for awhile before coming to the world of Norrath. I like the name because it's unique and never taken and people remember it. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Why did you pick an Enchanter? </span>
<br />When I started EQ I don't remember how I ended up with Enchanter. I remember reading the description in the little booklet and thinking yeah...thats what I want...to make people bend to my will! MOHAHAHAHHA! Since then I've never looked back and don't even have any alts above 10. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could go back and change anything about your character (if anything) what would it be? </span>
<br />What would I change if anything? As a human, Oot has always been a little lacking in INT. That drove me nuts as he grew up but recently he's managed to max both INT and CHA and he's fine now. So while I wanted to change that...I'd pass on it now. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you give someone who just started an Enchanter? </span>
<br />The only advice I'd give to someone starting an enchanter is to get into dungeon's with groups as much as possible as thats where you learn the art of crowd control and also have the most fun. And fun is whats it's all about right? 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd like powers?</span>
<br />If I was a developer for one day and could give our class anything, I'd give them a new AA...lets call it Mindburn. Puts you into a trance sitting and helpless, using up mana til you're hit or your mana runs out. During that time you look out the eyes of the mob and control it as if you were it. Now THAT would be cool. Sort of the enchanter version of manaburn. 
<br />
<br />Either that or a wisp illusion with mana regen....just for fun. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone for pure fun factor? </span>
<br />My favorite zones are the indoor dungeons of old. The Guk's, the Seb's...and even Splitpaw. I was always taking groups inside way past the double doors of Splitpaw just because I could. GREAT FUN and scary as hell for most characters because it wasn't just the nice safe camp that they were used too. Quite the rush! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie based on EQ, whom would you pick to play you?</span>
<br />Hmmm...if any of you have seen Oot, he's bald with a goatee. Leaves you a bunch of actors that could fit the bill...Bruce Willis, Vin Diesel, Patrick Stewart perhaps even, but I think John Malkovich (As he was in Con Air) would be the best as he's great at being evil which Oot is on occasion. Hell...I could play him as I shave my head on occasion for fun.</div>

			<div class="content">This week I introduce <span style="color: red">Runespire Stormbringer of Povar</span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your character. Server, guild, anything you want us to know. </span>
<br />
<br />I am Runespire Stormbringer, a level 65 agnostic High Elf Enchanter on the Povar sever. I am currently in the Utopian guild, an Elemental level guild, and have been a member for 10 months. I have 245 AA's and currently I am working my non-Jewelcraft tradeskills up to complete the 8th Coldain Shawl (Currently working on the 5th) and eventually the Aid Grimel Tradeskill earring quest. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Why did you pick an Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />My first charachter was an Erudite Wizard and in my 30's I hooked up with an awesome family guild, Vitam Aeternam, that was re-building. As we grew we lacked certain classes to keep progressing and one of those was an Enchanter. So out of need, almost 3 years ago, Runespire became my new main and I have played an Enchanter almost exclusively ever since. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you give someone who just started an Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />From the very start, don't try to make your Enchanter fit in a certain mold or play-style. There's no 'right' amount of base Int, Race or Religion. Make it your own and have fun with the challenges that come with picking an evil race or a god. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone for pure fun factor? </span>
<br />
<br />Newbie/low-level zones would be Tox Forrest and The Warrens. My first 30 levels of EQ were spent mostly in those two zones. I still go back to visit Sentinal Flavius in Tox, who saved my hide many a time from Fire Bettle trains, and Food master Foo and Smitty Ragamuffin in Kobold town. 
<br />
<br />Higher-end zone would be Kael because the Arena always makes for good fun after, or even during, an AOW raid! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have one ability or spell line from another class what would it be?</span> 
<br />
<br />Track! Especially while working on the Shawl quest recently I've found out how valuable that ability would be! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What would you say is your most rewarding accomplishment to date? </span>
<br />
<br />Completing my Vex Thall key. All those hours at Com camps, shard camps, preping for Emperor Raids, killing the Emp on the first try, etc. all made it worth it when we roamed around VT for the first time and made it to Aten. And, without that key, I wouldn't have my two favorite pieces of gear, Mask of Secrets and Silver Band of Secrets! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you think you will be trying EQ2? </span>
<br />
<br />Probably not. The reason I started playing EQ was to learn MMORPGs in anticipation of SWG which got delayed so often that by the time it was released, I had no interest in it or taking time from playing Runespire. I think the same may happen with EQ2, as long as new things for EQ1 continue, because of all the time and work I have invested in my character and my class. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie based on EQ, whom would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />Since I use Illusions often, and am hardly ever in my true form, there would have to be a few actors to play my role: 
<br />
<br />High Elf Runespire: Spike Jonze 
<br />Erudite Runespire: Ice Cube 
<br />Guktan Runespire: Andy Serkis/CGI 
<br />Gnome Runespire: Danny DeVito</div>

			<div class="content">Well you all know and love Arcady, but this week I decided to interview her! Without further ado.. I introduce Arcady <img src="./images/smilies/toothy10.gif" alt=":D" title="toothy10.gif" />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your character. Server, guild, anything you want us to know</span>. 
<br />
<br />Arcady was the tradeskill mule of a good friend. When the original player quit the game, I took over the account. I posted about this in another section, but the basics were that I inherited Arcady, a level 53 enchanter. After we lost our guild's only level 60 chanter that could cast KEI. I took the noble route and started leveling her up to 60. The only problem was, I was CLUELESS. Up until that point, I had only played melee characters and this whole 'caster' thing was a little beyond my normal scope of activity. I knew from experience, that it would be easy getting groups with her, but unless I knew what I was doing, I would look like a total tool getting in these groups. So, off I went with Arcady to Nadox. I spent 4 levels and countless deaths learning the nuances of a chanter. A few dedicated fools...I mean guildmates..eventually came by and started grouping with her so she could learn grouping skills. 
<br />
<br />Once I got Arcady to level 60, I had her scribe her KEI scroll and was all set and done, or so I had thought. I went back to my melee characters and just couldn't get back into the groove. I couldn't handle the monotony nor the loss of control. Suddenly, I realized the problem. I had become Arcady. Now it was no longer, I took Arcady to Plane of Storms, I went to plane of Storms. Now, I am level 65 with 115aa's and couldn't be happier. 
<br />
<br />As to the wonderful person who gave me the account, he came back to the game in January. He started a beastlord that is now level 65 and the raid leader of the Mithril Ankh, the family/raid guild that I am the proud leader of. The sweetest thing he has ever said was in reference to a question I had asked him one day. I asked him if he had any ill feelings about the way Arcady had changed. About how her personality was now so different. He replied to me, " It is like I had this WONDERFUL puppet that would dance for me. NOW, that puppet has cut her strings and dances on her own. And she dances WONDERFULLY." 
<br />
<br />Mixmur, you truly are my Jepeto. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Why did you pick an Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Fate intervened. It was destiny, karmic destiny. The real question though, would be "Knowing what you know now, would you choose a chanter again?" Yes, there is nothing more satisfying to the soul then keeping the group alive when the world is at its darkest. There is nothing like a hasted elemental charmed with with full mage gear turning out 400-500 dps. There is nothing like the feeling you get from being the KEY to a win. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you give someone who just started an Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Don't neglect your character. Don't let spell skills slide. Don't let other skills slide. Learn to solo. But also, learn to group as well. Our class is one of the most varied classes in the game and our creativity is what sets us apart. Learn everything you can, but never stick to convention. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd like powers? </span>
<br />
<br />With my GAWD like powers, I would do TWO things. First I would finish our spells. Deception, Illusion Gender and any of the other Illusions we were promised would be given out. I would also SHORTEN the duration of KEI to be in line with Tranq and VoQ. And THEN, I would create single shot versions of those spells as well. Second of TWO things, would be to revamp our AA's. Screw Packrat, screw Improved Innate Lung Capacity, INNATE INVIS AND UPGRADED DC! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have one ability or spell line from another class what would it be? </span>
<br />
<br />It would have to be some kind of lichform or canni. We are the masters of the mind and I see no reason why we would not be able to affect our own bodies to feed our minds. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What would you say is your most rewarding accomplishment to date?</span> 
<br />
<br />I have many accomplishments that have been rewarding. My 8th Shawl, finishing the Epic, even getting as far as I have in PoP by attending pick up raids for flags, but I would have to say my most rewarding accomplishment is my guild. We had suffered many ups and downs in the 2+years since our establishment. We had some serious shake ups that rocked the core of our existence. But through diligent work and care by not only myself, but also those wonderful officers who work under me, we have come back, bigger, stronger and even more dedicated. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What goals do you have for your character over the next 6 months or so?</span> 
<br />
<br />Elementals. I will have my Elementals flag soon. I also would like to hit 3000hp unbuffed before the new level cap goes into effect. With those two items under my belt, advancement past there should be fast and easy. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie based on EQ, whom would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />Hmmmm...this is a good question. Truthfully, I find it hard to even imagine one person playing a chanter who changes Illusions as often as most people change clothes. With that in mind, animation is the only way to go and the person I would love to provide the voice for Arcady would be Kathleen Turner or Sally Kellerman. The two most sultry voices ever to appear on the big screen, they are both incredible.</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="color: red">Vami Interview</span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your character. Server, guild, anything you want us to know. </span>
<br />
<br />Vami is a pretty young enchantress of the 51 season on the AB server in a small family guild called Warbirds. My reduced online times didn't allow me yet to develop her further, but i hope that this will change in the next months. The one skill she has developed the most is training zone lines, since she just decided to master the power of charm, which disobeys her still more than she would like it and mostly at moments most improper. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Why did you pick an Enchanter?</span> 
<br />
<br />Vami was born around christmas 2002, 3 months after i had started EQ. My main back than (and still today, at least officially) was a druid, who had one of these lifechanging experiences in the Overthere: our puller came back with 5 mobs on her tail! and the only thought i had: run to zone, there is no ench around ... but i forgot the lvl 65 enchanter-bot that was parked by one of my groupmates behind. She stopped the adds with one cast of her unbelievable powerful spell and turned our secure death into a glorious victory - sounds familiar to you, hm? 
<br />When i logged out that night, i created a female Dark Elf enchantress, who has since then served as my dressing doll, money maker (with her JC skill of course!), leisure park and most stubborn part of a Dark Elf sister trio (SK and cleric played by my boyfriend). 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd like powers?</span> 
<br />
<br />I would introduce more different dressing possibilities! Not just 5 (or are there 6?) different robes, which can be dyed as you like it, but also more leather and or even plate armor - perhaps obtainable through lengthy quests, since that would be definately worth doing in my eyes! I would also introduce some clothes that dont look "hot" - nothing bad about looking hot, but the women of Norrath definately deserve the chance to wear comfortable clothing! 
<br />
<br />A more earnest thing i would like to implement is more instanced content targeted at those "family-guilds". Having to run through Norrath, its moon and the lower planes for half an hour, just to call the planned raid for the evening off cause nothing is up you could do or was just killed by one group of EP geared people out of boredom, and for those things that are up, your guild lacks numbers for. And i like scripted events like the gnome-event in CT and such, which really give you a feeling of accomplishment when the final mob is dropped after some hours of working concentrated together. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have one ability or spell line from another class what would it be?</span> 
<br />
<br />Snare is nice - but well, makes charming easier, but not as much as i always thought 
<br />Heals are good - but we have runes. 
<br />FD would be fun - but who could stand lying around while you still might have the chance of saving all by standing up and do what enchanters are famous for? 
<br />All nice things to have, but they would make life just a tad easier. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you offer a brand new enchanter that you wish someone had told you? </span>
<br />
<br />Charm from lvl 12 on. Never be afraid of being hit. Corpse runs might be annoying, but still better than never having tried something unorthodox - it might work and you never found it out! 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What goals do you have for your character over the next 6 months or so? </span>
<br />
<br />The things every character around my level wants: EPIC! (it's soooo pretty!), some levels - being able to cast KEI soon would be neat!, perfect my skills. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you think you will be trying EQ2? </span>
<br />
<br />I swore to myself once, i will never try another MMORPG, since the time i have invested in EQ1 is enough of gaming time for a lifetime (at least mine, some of you might have spent that time on in a month), but i already broke that vow (short trip to Horizons, only to come running back to EQ after the free trial month was over). No plans here, but might be possible. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie based on EQ, whom would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />The most difficult question of them all! An animated EQ movie would be my way to go. Then Vami should be drawn like one of the cat girls in Vision of Escaflowne - without the kitty stripes of course. 
<br />But if it has to be a real movie, i would need several actresses, one for each illusion i might use! 
<br />Janeane Garofalo for when in gnome form 
<br />Angelina Jolie for my human moments 
<br />Scarlett Johansson would make a fine light elf - my favourite illusion 
<br />the young Angelica Houston - my choice for the real Dark Elf form, too bad i am so rarely seen in it</div>

			<div class="content">Navere's Interview
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your character. Server, guild, anything you want us to know. </span>
<br />My characters name is Navere Tenshifyre. Navere was taken from the name Navarre which is a dark region of mountains in Spain. Tenshi means angel in Japanese anf fyre is pretty self explainatory. 
<br />
<br />Server I play on is E'ci. and I'm an officer for Reconstructed, which is the top guild on my server.(yay  ) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could go back and change anything about your character (if anything) what would it be? </span>
<br />
<br />Hmm if I could go back and change anything about my character? To be honest nothing really. I lucked out my brother played eq and knew a little about the class, he told me to put it all into int. 
<br />The only thing I can really think of is I might have put a little bit more into cha since I am a dark elf, and we only start at about 75. which was defintly teh suk when first learning to charm.  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd like powers? </span>
<br />If I was a developer for a day? CHANTERS WOULD ALL GET FD!!!!!!! 
<br />Seriously would rock. Inc mob . tash then fd. Would be great hehehe. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone for pure fun factor? </span>
<br />
<br />My favorite zone for fun factor is Ssra. Now that may seem strange to alot of people, but when I first joined my guild is when we we're learning emp. And it was such a rush to be able to move quickly around a zone to get to all the cool high mobs...and well not die~ 
<br />Ssra was such a wow factor for me, my old guild could hardly take on rumblecrush, and there I was being a potential member(PM) for a guild who was taking out stuff in Ssra like they were firebeetles in nek forest . 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What goals do you have for your character over the next 6 months or so? </span>
<br />
<br />Goals for my character over the next six months...hmmm. I'd really like to get my 2.0 epic ( well that is if they ever finish the exspansion correctly  ) Doing my epic, and finishing it, was a huge mark of pride on my part. Be nice to keep going with it. And of course beat the content were raiding at the time. Thats always a given:) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you offer a brand new enchanter that you wish someone had told you?</span>
<br />
<br />The advice I'd offer a brand new enchanter hmmmm. Meet alot of new people. 
<br />See I know alot of chanters like to solo and get mega AA, but thats just not me. I'm a social creature by nature. Part of the main reason I play eq still is because of the poeple I've met over there years. Without them I would have lost interest looooong ago. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie based on EQ, whom would you pick to play you?</span>
<br />
<br />Lol if I was making a movie who would I pick to play me? Angelina Jolie!!!!!! &lt;3 that woman. I mean I love my fiancee and all, but shes just soooo completly drool factor... erm sorry where was I?  
<br />Anyways shes very sexy, and thats how I see De's. Evil with a whole lot of sex appeal rolled in.</div>

			<div class="content">This week I interviewed <span style="color: red">Cerpicio aka </span><span style="color: red">Fenbin of Lanys</span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Tell us a bit about your character. Server, guild, anything you want us to know </span>
<br />
<br />Fenbin Dazzlebright, level 65 Gnome enchanter, with 70+ AAs. 
<br />Agnostic. Lanys T'vyl. 
<br />Flagged for all the elemental planes. 
<br />Been playing just over two years. 
<br />Member of Ak'anon's Destiny, an all-gnome guild. I joined it about level 20 and was a member and officer till about level 60. I wanted a little more action so I joined a raiding guild, but RL changes limited my play time and I went back to AD. (They even allowed me to be the GL for 5 minutes, just so I could said I did it.) 
<br />GrandMaster JC and Tinker, with a trophy for each. 200 in everything else but tailoring (180). 
<br />Owner of the 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl. 
<br />I'm a male IRL, but play a female enchanter. It just made more sense to me that an enchanter would be female. When people give me a hard time about it, I just remind them I'm not an enchanter nor a gnome IRL either. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Why did you pick an Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />At first, it seemed they'd always be wanted in a group; they have a unique role. 
<br />I stuck with it because I love the versatility: illusions, faction modifiers, haste buff and mana regen buff so all classes like us, enchant metal spells, and of course charming and mezzing! Mostly the mezzing, I love being able to save the group from a bad pull or an add. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-If you could go back and change anything about your character (if anything) what would it be?</span> 
<br />
<br />I'd change nothing about my character. I don't use illusion very often either. Why should I? I'm already the best race in the game. Gnome Powah! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd like powers?</span> 
<br />
<br />Add the Deception spell. 
<br />Oh! And un-nerf Gravity Flux! I had tons of fun blasting my guildmates into the air. I also love doing that to giants. (If I could get a custom title, I'd make it "Fenbin Dazzlebright, Giantslayer") 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-What is your favorite zone for pure fun factor? </span>
<br />
<br />The Warrens is great for when I start up a new character. I love killing kobolds when they are in mid-howl. Plus, turning in the molars for XP and gear is a nice addition. 
<br />I also love soloing in HoH. Killing ~14 PoP mobs in under 15 minutes and getting one AA an hour is nice. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Was there one defining moment where you fell in love with your enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Making our way into Karnor's Castle and getting add after add before we finished the old one off. I kept mezzing the adds and keeping the current ones parked. It was hectic, but great fun! 
<br />Not to brag, I'm sure a lot of enchanters get it, but I love being complemented on doing a good job mezzing. I don't think many other classes get complements like we do. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-What is your opinion on the direction recent expansions have taken the Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />I like a lot of our AAs, though the GoD AAs are questionable. I don't like that fact that entire zones (or nearly so) are marked as un-charmable. I bought the GoD expansion, but still haven't visited it. It will be interesting to see what this next expansion (OoW) gives us. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-What goals do you have for your character over the next 6 months or so? </span>
<br />
<br />Get epic, the first one, then see about the new versions. Work on defensive AAs. Work on LDoN, maxing points. Get the couple rare spells I'm still missing. 
<br />
<br />Long-term goal: Visit as many zones as I can. GM Pottery and fletching, but that won't be till after I get a lot of other AAs. 
<br />I plan on going to the Plane of Mischief very soon. Sounds like a fun place. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-If they were making a movie based on EQ, whom would you pick to play you?</span> 
<br />
<br />Hmm, tough question. I'd have to go with a previous answer someone else used and say Allison Hannigan should play Fenbin. 
<br />
<br />...and if I may be so bold as to answer some more questions: 
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">One ability I'd like from another class?</span> 
<br />
<br />I like mage's Summon Monster spell. I wish we could cast Illusions on our animations. 
<br />But I also really like the swarm pet AAs. 
<br />Yeah, that's more than one. Sue me. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Favorite EQ Quote? </span>
<br />"Ernie-oxulous, Bertoxxulous evil roommate." 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Favorite EQ item I own?</span> 
<br />Preserved Chodidai Vocal Cords. Enchanter-usable Voice Graft! Perfect for charming Emperor Crush and D'vin.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Amris wrote:</cite>As Starmist had volunteered to help out with this also, I wanted to honor his willingness to help by making him Enchanter of the Week for this week.  Yes, I chose arbitrarily this time, I'm not sure how I'll choose in the future, but for now, I would like to introduce you to <span style="font-style: italic">Starmist!</span><br /><br />~ Amris<br /><br />The interview with Starmist:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Please tell us about your enchanter's personality, if you perceive that he/she has one. </span><br /><br />Hi everyone. I’m honored to be able to do this. My Enchanter’s personality is an extension of what EQ should be about as a game. I think that we are all there to play a wonderful game that allows us to meet, talk to, and interact with people that we would never have had contact with otherwise. As someone who is tries to be a good person and help other people in real life (my profession is that of a Social Worker) I try to do the same thing in EQ. I can be seen at the end of an evening casting an MGB KEI and then buffing a few young ones who are too low for KEI. I try to answer questions I may get from new Enchanters, and encourage them to stay in touch with me if they need further help. I also think I have the right amount of confidence (some call it arrogance) to think that I can get difficult situations under control. I’d like to think that I do well in crisis situations both in RL and in EQ. My Enchanter is real big on politeness and respect of others, and I have little use for other players that don’t. My Enchanter is an reflection of who I am in real life. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you become an enchanter, what made you choose the class?</span> <br /><br />I started EQ with a Druid, which I leveled to 56. My second character was a Cleric (also 56) and a monk (52). Along the way was totally blown away by seeing what good Enchanters could do. There was one guy in Splitpaw (in my Druid’s mid 20’s) who kept the group alive through mezz after mezz and mezz break after mezz break. I used to see Enchanters soloing, but also realized that they were always in demand. I was tired of healing and porting, and pure melee has never been really appealing to me, so when I created my Enchanter, I instantly fell in love with the class. I loved everything about it, from charming to mana regen, to crowd control and buffing. When I got to Karnor’s Castle I knew I was hooked on the class. For me, there was nothing like that feeling that I had there, standing amid a slew of mezzed mobs in the left courtyard (the area where the steps going up to the Hand room is), being totally in “the zone” and just waiting for the next add to show up. I’m still glad I made that choice of classes for my main. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Please tell us what server you are on, and a bit about your server. </span><br /><br />My server is Zeboxxoruk which was formed by the splitting of The Rathe and E’ci around the end of 2000. We have one guild in Tacvi, two others in Qvic (3 all told), and two others in Time (5 all told). The people are pretty nice for the most part, and the server itself doesn’t seem overly crowded. <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How long have you been an enchanter, and do you play any other classes regularly? </span><br /><br />My Enchanter’s birthday was just this past Sept 4th, she was three years old. The only other class I play remotely regularly is my Paladin, who is level 54 and has 115 AAs. I pretty much log my Paly on to help tank in certain situations (Ragefire the other day being the most recent) It’s a nice break once in a while to play a class that can melee, heal, and has an AA horse but my first and still true love is Starmist &#61514; <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Is there anything more you wish enchanters could do? A new or different ability, or one we should get more focus on, in your opinion? </span><br /><br />I’d love to see a Divine Arbitration type AA for us. It seems so logical and natural to me that if Clerics can average out hit points to help the group, we should be able to do the same with mana. Two other things I’d also like to see would be some sort of warning on charm breaks and a better set of animations for each level that we get them. Even just more HP would really be sweet <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you have any advice for new or lower level enchanters? Perhaps something you wish you'd been told when you were new to the class. </span><br /><br />Ask lots of questions and do your homework. There are some great guides and stickied topics on The Runes. Use all the resources you can get your hands on, be it other players, web info, etc. Playing an Enchanter is perhaps the most difficult thing to do in EQ. There is a lot to learn, a lot to do, and you are very visible to other players, especially in raid situations .Don’t be afraid to take charge of a group if it’s failing or floundering. Teach tanks how to use assist if they are breaking mezz and leave bad groups rather than waste your time beating your head against a wall. Learn how to use your cycle nearest NPC function, it will make life so much easier for you. You will make mistakes, learn from them. Above all, have fun, it’s a great class, and you should be enjoying most of your time playing it. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What's your favorite part of being an enchanter? </span><br /><br />I guess I would have to say the feeling I get when I know that I made a big difference in a group or raid situation. Being able to control bad situations and save groups/raids from disasters. It matters a lot to me that I have skills which are valuable to other players and I can be of help to people, whether it’s with mana regen, tradeskills, or just being there to mezz and slow a mob or two. I wouldn’t trade playing this class for any other in EQ. <br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=520295">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=520295</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">Thank you Starmist!</span></div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Introducing <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Aithur!</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- Please tell us about your enchanter's personality, if you perceive that he/she has one. </span><br /><br />I would say he can be kind and helpful, and would like to see people grow. (he doesn't have time to wait for people to do things on their own.. it would take to long) But, he can be pretty arrogant and snooty sometimes. Of course, high elves are better than everyone else  hehe. He admires the ingenuity of the gnomes though and the spirit of the guktan.. and often can be seen walking around as one of these races  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- How did you become an enchanter, what made you choose the class? </span><br /><br />Oh I started playing eq just a little over 2 years ago.. so im a big noob  but my friends were telling me about it and we went online and looked at the different classes listed. I read through each and saw the standards stuff.. healer.. tank.. and thats fine but immediately when I was the enchanter I knew thats what I wanted to be, and I have enjoyed my choice ever since. I like the idea of not being the main person in the group that attacks the mob up front. I like controlling a situation and being a support class. of course its fun to take control of mobs and go crazy when I do that, but I enjoy all the stuff we can do.. well except maybe slow.. I don't care for it.. boooo  hehe. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- Please tell us about your guild, or if you don't have one, why. </span><br /><br />one of the first in game people I met was Sellik.. now hes a crazy little ill tempered dark elf but a pretty good guy  he started Disciples of Defiance as a family guild and it continues to be one today. Im the guild leader now and I think most of the people joined just so they could laugh at me when I die  we have about 25 or 30 members.. mostly casual players. we just tag along on runs and help each other out where we can. we don't have a cleric thats not a bot even.. so we are limited in what we do as a guild, but we find ways to cause trouble  I love my guild.. its people like my guild members that really make eq great!  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- What server do you play on? What do you like about it?</span><br /> <br />Test my where I log on. Its a place filled with ups and downs and crazy bugs, but its a great place. It has a very low population which makes it hard to find groups or schedule stuff sometimes, but overall we do pretty good with what we have. Test is really great because its a smaller community. Most of us know each other and sometimes the server just feels like a big guild  Im sure like other servers we have a few things that work differently... but no real rules other than to have fun  There are 3 main raiding orgs on the server.. Primal Brood is the only raiding guild.. they are in the elementals now. DAZEN is a raiding org for more casual people... they hit stuff that ranges from Kael to low end PoP encounters. And, Test Server Friends is a raiding org comprised of people from many different guild and different types of folks haha... they are farming time right now and getting ready to hit Ikkinz (or however you spell that ) I am a member of both TSF and DAZEN.. and have some friends in PB.. all great orgs with great people on a great server! woohoo! stop by and say hi sometime  buffs are fee and so are the zones /snicker <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- How long have you been an enchanter, and if you could do it all over again, would you still be one? </span><br /><br />a little over 2 years.. a noob like I said hehe. (compared to a lot of you anyway) I wasn't around during the 'great mez period' hehe and I missed out on some of the craziness of the early days, but from the minute I started killing those rats in freeport I was hooked! I really can't imagine playing another class. I have a ranger as an alt that I played when trying not to pass my friends up to fast hehe.. but I still enjoy my enchanter a lot and it still feels like I have a long way to go with him! <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- Is there anything more you wish enchanters could do? A new or different ability, or one we should get more focus on, in your opinion? </span><br /><br />oh yeah.. who doesn't have ideas  hehe. I liked the Mana Rune idea for raid situations.. maybe some enchantment type stuff to boost our teammates abilities... or some more CC type abilities like making a mob hit nearby active allies randomly (for those pesky unmezzables hehe).. or maybe a shadow box spell that would make a mob think its on a pc until someone messes with him (and they go after the person who hit them instead of the enchanter muahahaha)... or change umbra so it made mobs miss more.. im just pulling these out of the air. I would like see us control mobs in more subtle ways when we can't use charm and to strengthen our allies also.. since groups focus on single pulls.. I would like to see something that keeps us busy. nuking is fun.. but im no wizard  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- Do you have any advice for new or lower level enchanters? Perhaps something you wish you'd been told when you were new to the class. </span><br /><br />for enchanter specifically.. don't be afraid to die  if you just go full throttle and try whatever you can really open up what you can do  it just take time to work and learn.. but that goes for everything. for everyone in general.. just be patient and know that people make the game what it is.. if you were the only one playing.. it would be much of a place to log into  help people where you can.. its often more rewarding than getting something for yourself  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- What's your favorite part of being an enchanter? </span><br /><br />having people say, 'wow' hehe.. I doesn't happen often really but its fun when it does  making a horrible mess by running into a room and aggroing way more than you intended and then running out and locking them down and pulling everyones butt out of the forest fire I just started is pretty fun hehe  mostly I like causing trouble</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Amris wrote:</cite>Thanks to <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Bellanfear</span></span> for being our enchanter of the week this week!  Without further ado, may I present his interview:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:  So sorry Bellanfear, I fixed your links, I didn't transfer them over well from the PM, but they're all set now!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Why did you choose an enchanter to play? </span><br /><br />I had a three or four friends who played EQ when I was in college. I avoided it like the plague because I knew I would get addicted and never be able to graduate. Upon nearing graduation they were trying to convince me and three other guys (basically, the rest of our weekly D&D group) to join up and play with them. It seemed like a good idea at the time because it would allow us to keep in contact after graduation. They basically said that we could pick any class since one of them played a cleric, but they thought one of us should play an enchanter. I knew a guy who had played an enchanter before and really enjoyed it. One of my favorite D&D classes was the wizard and the enchanter seemed like a wizard with a twist. So I tried it out, and here I am 70 lvls and 400+ AAs later. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-When you started your enchanter, what made you choose the race you did? </span><br /><br />Well, I have a confession: I'm not a gnome. I picked my race first. I usually played elves in D&D, and I like the grace and beauty of the elf in fantasy lore. I know many of you are probably thinking, "But he's a gnome in his signature!" I started using gnome illusion in raids, and since I had project illusion, I would forget to take it off a lot. I almost always walkaround in gnome form now. There are a few reasons for it. I wanted to be used to the same perspective in raids as I have in the rest of the game. I can cast it before any important buffs and have a permanent fake up. I find it entirely too amusing when I'm in a group with someone new for a long time and then I die somehow or we wipe and they see a High Elf looting a Gnome body. I have had long time guildmates that I group with on a regular basis come to the realization that I'm not a gnome only when they ask me to tinker something for them. (I'm a tradeskill fanatic, and I probably would have chosen gnome if I was making my enchanter as a second character.) <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Please tell us about your server, and what you feel your place is there. </span><br /><br />My server is Lanys T'vyl. <a href="http://pub130.ezboard.com/beqasylum" class="postlink">(forums here)</a> We are not really one of the top servers anymore. The only guild that we had that would standup serverwide in the top five or ten guilds was Conquest, and they left with the big guild exodus for the WoW beta. It seems as if we have a lot of drama in our top guilds and they can never really stick together. For example, one guild recently went full cycle and reformed again to complete the chain. (Sigil -&gt; Fervor -&gt; Occidio -&gt; Sigil) We used to actually have a lot of Role Playing guilds, but I think the only one that's left with any real RPing is Union of the Half Pint and their taller race friends, Brotherhood of the Half Pint. <br /><br />As for my place in the server, I rarely KEI random people and almost never KEI for donations. I also guild group almost exclusively. This makes me somewhat unknown to other guilds (I think). Maybe this is good and maybe it's bad, but I like grouping in guild since I know that success there helps with raiding as well. I guess my only real serverwide notoriety is that I am an active trader in the bazaar. I buy and sell stuff quite frequently (especially tradeskill items) and I enjoy the extreme competitiveness that goes on there. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Please tell us about your guild, and again, what you feel is your role or place in it. </span><br /><br />My guild is <a href="http://www.mythic-legends.com" class="postlink">Mythic Legends.</a> We are best described as a family raiding guild. We raid 4 days a week, and most of these raids are in the elemental planes. There is a very strong family guild atmosphere in ML, and the conflict between raiding and being a family-type guild is something we are very good at handling. One of the best things about ML is being able to voice your opinion and have a fair shot at being heard by everyone. <br /><br />As for my role in ML, that's a good question. I form a lot of guild groups and do a lot of tradeskill things for the guild, but I have no real official capacity within ML. I don't want to be an officer or anything. I'm prefectly content with my role as it is now. I wouldn't change much if I could wave a magic wand and change things though there are certainly one or two things I would change if I could.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Do you have any free advice for new (or old  ) enchanters? </span><br /><br />Well, I suppose I should qualify any advice I give as advice for the 'new' chanter because I'm relatively new myself. I didn't start playing until about 15 - 18 months ago. I'm not even sure I was level 55 a year ago today. When I started playing, I started with a bunch of other people and we coordinated our login times so we could all level up together and do things in the same level range. I would advise new or old people to try out an old dungeon with a character of the appropriate level range. EQ is a game meant to be fun and there are a lot of fun old dungeons out there that would be really fun to play in. If you can make a regular group of it, that's even better. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-If you could change one thing about enchanters, what would it be, and why? </span><br /><br />This is a loaded question for me to answer on an enchanter forum.  However, for me the answer is simple. I would eliminate non-group buffing. Buffs would be tied to the caster that cast them and wear off within 10 minutes of that player leaving the group or raid that he was in when he cast them. The fact that everyone walks around in full buffs makes the classes very hard to balance because it makes the usefulness of a buffing class highly questionable. I know I'm talking about all buffing classes here, but even if I could only affect enchanters with this change I would still do it. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-If you could steal any other class's ability, what would it be? And you can only pick one! </span><br /><br />Fading Memories. It's the best ability in the game, imho. I love pulling as an enchanter, but we have almost no recourse for that mega-disaster pull where you have 4 or 5 mobs that hit for 1k+ running at you. If I couldn't get FM, I would get FD. Feign is nice because you can use it over and over again without limit, but it can fail. I would rather have the 100% guarantee that Fade gives. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-If you could do it all over again, would you still play an enchanter?</span> <br /><br />Maybe. If I did, I would play a gnome enchanter so I could tinker things. It's hard to say though. I loved LDON as an enchanter, and thought GoD was at best so-so. OoW is not shaping up too well at all. I would probably give Cleric, Rogue, and Beastlord serious consideration. I have a cleric alt that I would have switched to as a main were it not for the fact that so many clerics are my friends and I wouldn't be able to group with them. Overall though, I am not really all that keen on the buffing classes now that I'm at the high end of the game for the reasons I mentioned above. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-What's your favorite part of being an enchanter? </span><br /><br />Crowd control. I love the rush of locking things down just in time. When I play my cleric, I actually like the same thing - being able to keep people alive long enough to make it out of the woods. Maybe I would have played a cleric if I could do it all over again. I love the other enchanters in my guild when we raid, but I never get to group with them. I suppose I could have swapped the two groups of friends. <br /><br />If you were to ask me this question before GoD came out I would have said charming. It was even more fun than CC when you knew that your pet was always on the verge of beating you to death and then causing problems for your party. I did a lot of charming in LDON and groups had a decent chance of surviving if the pet was able to kill me. When GoD was released, this changed to near 0% chance of survival in things like Vxed and Tipt. Charm was also unreal DPS then. It was probably only unfair DPS in lvl 65 hard LDONs before, but with GoD it was seriously out of balance. With the way things are now in OoW, I can honestly say that one of the things I loved most about the game is no longer fun.<br /><br />Thank you Bellanfear!<br /><br />~ Amris</div></blockquote></div>
