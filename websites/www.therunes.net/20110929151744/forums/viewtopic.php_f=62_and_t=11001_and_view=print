				<h3>Forums Update</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="./styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Jan 24th, '08, 02:20</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Riart</strong></div>
				<div class="content">As you probably already know, the forums have been updated to a new version adding much more functionality and features.  I have no major knowledge of CSS (well anything web developer related) so I make no guarantee you won't get an error with the layout, if you do, please let me know and I'll fix it.  If you have any database/php errors also let me know so I can clear up those bugs.  The style may change, Juwel will have to decide what she wants.<br /><br />On to the new features!<br />The report a post is back again, and there is a bookmarking of posts feature, so you can save posts you want and access them from your user control panel, located near the bottom of the page.  I really can't think off the top of my head what else is new.  But there really is a lot of cool new things.<br /><br />The search function will not work right away, the database needs to rebuild and it might take a day since its indexing at about 3 posts/second.<br /><br />To close things up, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE (I'm begging of you, really I am), let me know of any errors so I can fix them.</div>

				<div class="content">It looks really pretty at first glance and I'm sure there is some improved functionality, but I'm finding it really hard to read.  Some of it is just getting used to the new symbols for new posts and such.  However some of it is the text color/background color.  I have a hard time seeing differentiation (is that a word?) between posts so they all blur together, the darker alternating background is too light.</div>

				<div class="content">Riart is in the process of rebuilding the search database.. we had a problem yesterday when we were getting hammered by some IP and using up CPU for the whole server. The site was suspended twice .. eeeek.. so Riart thought it best to not take any chances and to rebuild it off site. It will take a bit more time, but he is working on it. <br /><br />The report button is a triangle with a red ! over there to the right, well at least for now. I'm working on finding us better icons.</div>
