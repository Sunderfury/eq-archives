			<div class="content">This week, I would like to introduce <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Nadia</span></span> to you!
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you get interested in EQ? </span>
<br />
<br />I have a love for pencil and paper RPGs. I was wary of doing online games because I know they can be absorbing (to a fault). I think I was bored with PC games games at the time and took the "EQ plunge" in 1999. As expected, I play too much! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Have you played any other classes? If not, which would you play if you could know already how to play it and have a high level one? If so, which other classes, and how did you like it? </span>
<br />
<br />out of the 16 classes, I have tried: Druid,Paladin,Beastlord,Monk,Cleric,Ranger,Necro,Shaman,Beastlord,Shadowknight 
<br />
<br />I love the paladin class because they have similarities with chanters for being able to do CC with stuns and roots, group heals for AE aggro is nice too 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">When did you realize that you were hooked on the enchanter and were not going to change? </span>
<br />
<br />I played a monk for my 1st year of EQ (preKunark). I got weary of the raid life and started doing alts like crazy. The Enchanter was the 8th class I tried in EQ. My druid had really turned me off the casters due to the meditation needs of gaining mana (its SLOW when you have no clarity or FT). I intially made a chanter to help my guild out (they were in short supply) and I got hooked in my chanter teens after seeing the class in action for Crowd Control. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Please tell us a little about your guild and your server. </span>
<br />
<br />My server is Brell Serilis, it was a roleplay Server introduced in late July 99. I picked the server only because it was brand new. I didnt know anyone. My guild is Watchers and Ive been with them for almost 3 years. They are in the top 4 on Brell for content advancement. I did find PoP raids fun but GoD raids were a huge turnoff for me. Ive recently gone back to being a nonRaider. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Any advice to new or even not-so-new enchanters? </span>
<br />
<br />both have their challenges. I feel bad for the level 66+ enchanters because charming in OoW is practically *worthless*. My advice to them is to keep your chin up to the next expansion where we are hopefully treated better, like Shamans got treated better in OoW. 
<br />
<br />For younger chanters, theres less people to play with at those levels like there was in EQs earlier days so its tougher to get a group to do the fun dungeons like Guk. I advise the younger chanters not to level too fast and try to bring groups to Sebilis and Howling Stones. Enchanters really do shine in DUNGEONS! My best times in Everquest was as a chanter under 60 in Old World/Kunark dungeons. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What, through the years playing, has been your favorite expansion, and your favorite parts of playing an enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />for me it was Kunark. I spent a year+ fooling around in Sebilis with the froggies. Disco Fever. nothing was immune to stuns/charms unless it was 55+, things were rarely immune to mez, and frog trains were fun to lockdown. 
<br />
<br />LDoN gave me a little of the old school flavor again -- but I had the most fun when I could mez/AE stun/ and no pull is too big ! I miss the old days of CCing trains.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Thank you Nadia!<br /><br />~ Amris</span></div>

			<p class="author"><a href="./viewtopic.php?p=562#p562"><img src="./styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" /></a>by <strong><a href="./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3" style="color: #AA0000;" class="username-coloured">Juwel</a></strong> &raquo; Jun 16th, '03, 11:46 </p>

			

			<div class="content">In our 2nd installment I introduced you all to <span style="color: blue">Mesmor </span> 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What level is your enchanter and what server do you play on? </span>
<br />Mesmor (full name and title " Master Mesmor Izer") is level 60 and resides on The Tribunal server with the guild Disciple of the Night. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone to play in? Not for experience grinding, but just fun!? </span>
<br />My favorite zone to play in would have to be Karnor's Castle. Now matter how many expansions come along...you can always count on a train in Karnor's hehehe. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How long have you been playing EQ and how were you introduced to the game? </span>
<br />I have been playing Everquest since March 21, 2000. Two friends of mine that live in a neighboring state both played and kept hounding me to try the game. Finally, I caved in and fell in love with it. Three years later, I still have a deep love for the game and enjoy playing as often as I can. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have one ability or spell line from another class what would it be? </span>
<br />Hmm, if I had to pick one, and only one, ability from another class I think I would drive myself crazy trying to decide. The two top choices for me would have to be the monk Feign Death (the ability...not the spell) and snare. In the end, I think I would pick snare. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Was there one defining moment where you fell in love with your enchanter? If not, then do you have a favorite story with Mesmor?</span> 
<br />As far as any one defining moment causing me to fall in love with my chanter goes...I can't really say that there was one. Probably more like a series of individual situations is what did it for me. You have to understand, Mesmor was not really created because I thought it would be fun to play an Enchanter. I created him because my guild had zero enchanters at the time and player made resist gear was not only some of the best resist gear around but it was hellishly expensive. So, I created Mesmor specifically to Grandmaster Jewel Craft so that I could crank out resist gear for the guild. Mesmor was a GM Jeweler at level 34 as a result. Of course, by that time I seriously enjoyed playing him. I did a LOT of train wrecking in Karnor's which really showed me the underlying power of the enchanter, but it wasn't until my first trip to Sebilis that I got a chance to make my own jaw drop in amazement. I arrived at the zone, /ooc LFG, and was asked to join the B2 group. I got to the group, buffed everyone up, and the tank/puller looks at me and says, "I hear you're pretty good." I was like...hmmm....ok. I thanked him for the compliment and said that I try my best and that's about it. He replies, "we are about to find out just how good you are" I'm thinking to myself...damn...first time in Seb and I'm gonna die. I memmed up my AoE stuns...an AoE mez....and the tank calls incoming. There wasn't one mob...or two...or even three for that matter....there were 10 froggies streaming into the camp. I saw my life and the life of my group flash before my eyes and all I could think was "if I can just buy the druid some time she can get us the hell outta here". So...I jumped into the middle of the frogs and started lighting off the AoE stuns. It quickly became apparent that the druid had no interest in "getting us outta here"...this is what they were here for...lol. So...I started trying to lock down the mobs with mez...but I couldn't target worth a damn...there were just too freakin many froggies...lmao. Wincing and expecting to be dead any second, I hit the esc key to clear my target box and paused long enough between stun cycles to take a hit. Viola! Frog targeted....and shortly there after mezzed. Rinsed and repeated as needed and soon all the froggies were happily slaughtered. 
<br />
<br />After the looting and such, the tank looks over at me and says "yeah...you'll do". Now, I'm only level 51 and I'm still sweating bullets over that pull, but happy that nobody died and that it was in large part ME that saved them....but I'm still convinced that it was just a bad pull...nobody pulls 10 frogs on purpose...right? Wrong. 10 was the smallest pull of the day....there were times we had 20 frogs in front of us but at the end of the day we had lots of sellable loot, lots of exp gain and zero deaths. It wasn't until we decided to head out when the tank told me "You're pretty good...keep playing your chanter...it's hard to find a good one". If I wasn't hooked already....that little compliment right there certainly would have done it.</div>

			<div class="content">~ HAEWUD~ His story!
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What level/server/guild is your enchanter, and is there any special meaning to your name? </span>
<br />Haewud is a level 57 Dark Elf Beguiler on the Luclin server, and has been a member of Lunar Shadows since December or so, notwithstanding a 2.5-month break from the game. From level 20-48, his full name was Haewud Jahblomie. At level 48, I requested that a GM strip my last name to allow me at least a pretense of respectability. I'll definitely be surnameless from here on out. I've been told the spelling of "Haewud" looks Korean, and people seem to misspell it a lot. Everyone just calls me Hae. "Hae, Hae, Hae! It's bluuuuue Haewud! He's gonna mez a mob for you-hoo...we'll have a good time, with Hae and all the gang, livin through encounters, while we do our thang..."(sung to tune of Fat Albert theme) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How were you introduced to EQ? And why did you pick an enchanter? </span>
<br />Some of my friends and co-workers had toons in their late 20's, and decided I could catch up. I originally started a warrior to complement their monk, cleric, shaman, and wizard -- it didn't take me long to realize that the melee class wasn't going to cut it for me. I almost went with a magician, but the prospect of being a crack dealer and messing with mobs' minds was too tempting to pass up. As I've learned to play the game, it's become very clear that enchanter is the class for me. It's twitchy yet strategic, and the ability to let everybody die is offset by the ability to save everyone when no one thinks it is possible. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have one ability/spell line from another class what would it be? </span>
<br />Tough one, this question. Most definitely NOT taunt! It's a toss-up between snare, feign death, evac, and healing. In the end, snare beats feign death in sudden-death overtime. Then, 96% rez appears and beheads feign death in one fell swoop. Evac would be nice for when I fail to do my job, but hey...I can always gate. So yeah, it's most definitely the rez that I want. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you change about our class (if anything) ? </span>
<br />Having not experienced the "enchanter life-change" that comes with the higher levels, I'm pretty content with my class at this point. That being said, I'd un-nerf gravity flux and fix the illusion factions properly right away, then shorten KEI to 1 hour and cut the mana cost by 60% as well, finishing up by putting illusion: scaled wolf into the game as a reward for a difficult quest. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If an EQ movie was being made, who would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />Jack Black would have to drop a few pounds to play me (the man behind the toon) convincingly, but a bald and blue-painted Woody Harrelson with pointy ears and a very narrow bleached flavor-saver beard would make a great Haewud -- virility, magnetism, and a progressive ideology being the key attributes.

			<div class="content"><span style="color: red">The Veneficus Grieg Interview</span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">First the basics about your character. What's your characters level, server and guild? </span>
<br />I'm a level 65 Enchanter residing on The Nameless server. I've been part of the guild Legacy of Steel for about 3 years now. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How were you introduced to EQ, and why did you pick an enchanter? </span>
<br />I got into EQ back during Beta Phase 2. I was still in college at at the time, and had been Beta testing Ultima Online for about a month before I caught word of EQ. After I got into the EQ Beta it didn't take me long to get another 6 college buds hooked before release. 
<br />
<br />Originally I had started a wizard on Tarew Marr (long live the Disco Server!) which I got up to level 44 in the first month and a half of release. My grades that term in college showed where my time was spent. I had a secondary character, a little gnome enchanter named Medicadis Mezmer who I charm solo'd using Griffawns in N Karana to kill red con beatles. That introduced, and subsequently hooked me on the class. 
<br />
<br />I quit for the summer to focus on an Internship, but when I got back to college for my Junior year I started playing again with friends who had moved to a brand new server. Thus Veneficus Grieg of The Nameless was born. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you change about our class?</span> 
<br />I'd give our class a self mana regen equal to what other wis/int casters have. Introduce a means of "linking" ourselves to another caster, so that whoever we link to could use our mana pool when casting spells at the cost of 3X the normal cost (so a 100 mana cost spell would drain 300 of ours). 
<br />
<br />Also would re-program the collision detection code, so that formation strategy could be implemented (i.e. Circle formation with tanks around the perimeters and healers/casters in the middle). 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Was there a particular moment that you fell in love with your enchanter, or was it a more gradual appreciation?</span> 
<br />Doing GIBS (Greater Ice Bone Skeletons) pulls in Lower Guk in my first hard core exp groups was the first moment. Laying down the AE mez and locking down 6 mobs all the while having the other group members quaking in their boots just hoping I didn't get a resist or die. 
<br />
<br />The second would have to be when we used to charm Fjord (aka "Frozen Moses") to kill King Tormax back in Scars of Velious days. The hilarity ofwatching King T die to "FLURRY" attacks in 3 minutes and working in a chain Dictate rotation was just too much fun. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have an ability from another class, which one would it be? </span>
<br />Would have to take the rogue skill Escape. Think of all the capers I could pull off then... 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie about EQ, who would they pick to play you? </span>
<br />Johnny Noxville. I'm sure he could make a good show of Tashicide and capture the essence of that painful exeprience. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What's your favorite movie? &lt;--- Haha just threw that one in there!</span> 
<br />My favorite movie would have to be Braveheart. I must have watched that a least once a week in college, if only to leave it playing in the background while doing homework. FREEEDOOM!</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="color: darkred">Lelyia's Story</span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How long have you been playing and what level is your enchanter?</span> 
<br />
<br />I have been Playing since apr 2001, so 2 years and 3 months. Lvl 65 with 202 aa(yeah I'm a slacker) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you want to throw in some info on your guild feel free </span>
<br />
<br />I'm a member of Dark Horizon the top guild on our server, our most recent accomplishment was reaching phase 5 earlier this week in time  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Why did you pick an enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Well to be honest I started playing to play with a r/l friend who had just started(he was lvl 10 at the time). He had made a wizzy and suggested I do the same, I did made it to lvl 2, some lvl 55 enc hit me with clarity, I thought that was badass so decided I'd rather be a chanter and be able to cast that cool mindbuff(yes that was the basic mentality then I knew nothing about any of the classes =P). Logged out made ma chanter and never stopped. The only other class thats even half as fun as we are is bards and I play them on occasion too . 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you have a most treasured memory or story? </span>
<br />
<br />Not especially  Well not in eq at least  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone to play in? Not for exp, just for fun </span>
<br />
<br />Hrm thats a toughy, in terms of play I have fun pushing my limits and those of the people around me. For example last night me + 1 person were 2 boxing in sol ro, I was wizzy/enc he was war/clr we cleared out the bottom floor and decided it would be fun to clear all the way to xulz, we did after that headed back down(we left xulz up didnt feel like dealing with him last night =P) And decided we'd do Galremos(the guy who as you kill him breaks down and spawns nice wonderful adds, charmable too  ) We won but kinda died at the end when the last 3 mobs that he spawned killed the cleric &gt;&lt;. Basically its all about challenges  
<br />
<br />But if you want a zone zone, umm for the current moment of time its chardok b, it changes weekly usually =P My next goal is to 1 group the area in torment where blood drops cause I want a full spell book damnit! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you offer a brand new enchanter that you wish someone had told you? </span>
<br />
<br />Umm well I met what was my mentor enc around the lvl of like 9 so there wasnt a very long time that I actually grouped without already having had someone explain my class to me hehe. The biggest advice I'd offer is about mezzing/assisting I guess. Course people don't seem to learn how to assist the mt, until around lvl 50+ so  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Oh and of course, if they were making an EQ movie, who would you have play you? </span>
<br />
<br />As I'm not a very avid movie goer(don't watch tv either) and I don't watch credits, I don't really know the names of many actors =P /shrug. Not a clue  
<br />

			<div class="content"><span style="color: blue">Rosi's Interview </span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tell us a bit about your character such as what server you play on, guild, stuff like that? </span>
<br />
<br />Rosi Dukeshammer is level 64, plays on Torvonnillous server and I am in the guild Twilight Brethren. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Who turned you on to EQ and why did you choose an enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />My husband started playing EQ in July 2001 and the game fascinated me, I used to watch him playfor hours and then nag him becuase he spent too much time on there. In the end to stop me nagging he bought me EQ and my own account in March 2002. At the time the guild he was in was desperately short of enchanters so I was persuaded to start one. I knew very little about any of the classes except cleric beacuse I had been watching him play so much. 
<br />Now he is only level 62 and bored with the game and he is nagging at me to stop playing it so much 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Was there a defining moment when you fell in love with your enchanter? If not tell us your favorite story. </span>
<br />
<br />I find it hard to remember the exact moment I fell in love with Rosi, I have always loved playing her. I love derailing trains,. There was one time just after PoP came out I was in PoI when we had adds. I had 6 mobs mezzed and manged to persuade the druid that evac was not necessary 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could take another classes ability or spell line which one would it be? </span>
<br />
<br />Easy would have to be feign dead 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Let's say you were a developer for one day what would you do with your God like power? </span>
<br />
<br />Hehe think about all my fellow enchanters and make the essence of vampire drop off every revenant in Hate for a week damn thing held up my epic for ages 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite movie? And while we are on the subject, if they were making a movie about EQ, who would play you?</span> 
<br />
<br />I have lots of favourite movies but I guess my current favourite is probably Bridget Jones Diary. As for who would play me in a movie it would have to be someone beautiful, charming and very short (being a gnome and all ) hmm maybe Jodie Foster</div>

			<div class="content">For those who weren't around when we first started this, Rista was the very first interview I did. Unfortunately it was lost when we moved to the upgraded server. Without further ado, <span style="color: red">I reintroduce us all to Rista </span> 
<br />
<br />Give us some background on your character. How long have you been playing, what server, guild info stuff like that. --Lets see, I have been playing since roughly July of 2001 on the Luclin server. First I had a ranger til about level 28, then a druid (current main) up to 56, and Rista the enchanter I have had for about...a year I think. Current guild is an extremely small close family/friend guild with strict entrance rules that ALL must approve entry Its wonderful!! 
<br />
<br />Why did you choose an enchanter? 
<br />--I first chose an enchanter to make the tailoring supplies my druid needed for the thurgadin shawl quests (she just got number seven! WOOT!), but I grew to love echanters when I realized they were the only ones with crack, and they were always much sought after in any group, as well as having a few lasting impressions of the most awsome enchanters in groups when I was young. 
<br />
<br />If you could borrow another class ability or spell line which one would it be? 
<br />--definitely the snare line, LOVE IT! or mend...mend would be nice hehe, or FD! omg lol, how about ALL other spells/skills? chanters could be even more uber!!! 
<br />
<br />What is your favorite zone to play in? Why is this your favorite? 
<br />--hmmm, this is an ever-changing answer. It all depends upon which character I am playing on and what levels. I really loved crystal caverns in the low 30's with my druid but I don't think my enchanter has gotten a favorite yet. She is still in that great xp grind right now. Although I can say that I love the out of the way zones, just explored siren's grotto last night and our group had a blast! My chanter would be great to have there. Any zone really with more than one mob inc at least some of the time hehe! 
<br />
<br />Do you have a favorite EQ story you want to share? 
<br />--well, I think I put my good stories in the war-stories page already. Oh, here is a good one, I met my current boyfriend through EQ up in the vast and scary loio, and we are pretty serious Not all peeps you meet online are ugly chain-smokin hairy ape men! (And yes we have met IRL many times) 
<br />
<br />Who would you pick to play you if they were making an EQ movie? 
<br />--lets see, since I still associate with my druid so much I have to answer as her as well, I like Claire Danes, nice mix of me IRL as well as my druid, would just have to give her big hairy feet hehe. 
<br />--as for Rista, well, she has a long flowing white pony tail and is a highelf...I imagine she looks like the elves in Lord of the Rings, so someone tall/willowy with blue eyes and looks good with stark white hair. Can't think of anyone off hand Oh, imperious too, I tend to get really bossy when on my chanter lol, and very very angry when peeps dont listen to me! Tis why I am ALWAYS the group leader, or I take over leadership in a group I join hehe, unless its guildies.

			<div class="content"><span style="color: red">Vinen's Interview!</span> 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Let's start with the basics. What level is your Enchanter, guild, server, etc?</span> 
<br />I am currently level 65 with 300+ AA. I am a member of the guild Hoss on Druzzil Ro. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Who got you hooked on EQ? And how did you end up with an enchanter?</span> 
<br />Well I started playing EQ when it first came out in March of 1999 (I think?). Played a SK for the first few months. I didnt really play that much, got him to level 50. Eventually I got bored of EQ, and went back to playing Starcraft and Total Annihilation Online. 
<br />
<br />Then about the time Druzzil Ro came online I decided to pick up the game again after talking to some people at a EBgames. I had forgot my password and didnt really care about my old char anymore. At first I started back up as a druid named Cecile. Was trying to replicate the name of the main character of FF2 but it wouldnt go in so added a e to the end... Anyhow it took me a while to realize I had made a Half Elf Druid.... with a Females name. Didnt really care at all about this found it amusing actually. But I had completly butcherd this chars starting stats (This was back when they meant something was still Pre Kunark). I think I had put them into STR and STA =/. 
<br />
<br />A month or so later, I came up with a sceme. I would make a enchanter so I could make money doing JC!!!. This was when I started Vinen... A day or so after starting Vinen I stopped playing Cecile. Well I went thou the normal crap, leveling etc, going thou a few guilds. Eventully when I reached level 60 I joined my first real raiding guild. I stayed with them for about a year, but eventually I got fed up with the direction the leadership was taking. 
<br />
<br />With the help of a friend of mine in Hoss I was able to start the guesting / eval process, this was about the start of PoP. Eventually I became a full member. Anyhow not much more to say on that. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your ultimate goal in EQ if any? </span>
<br />My Ultimate Goal is to break 7k HP max Buffed. Im 9hp away. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you give a person who had just started playing an enchanter?</span> 
<br />GROUP, GROUP, GROUP, GROUP, GROUP, GROUP. Learn CC. XP in Karnor's derail a few trains. XP in Seb deal with 3 or 4 pulls, etc. Wave Soloing for when you reach level 60+. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you have a favorite EQ memory that you care to share with us? </span>
<br />My favorite memory is probably the day my guild, Hoss defeated Rallos Zek. We had been working on him for a month or so, and the first day we had good attendance. BOOM he was owned, and we got the best drops too! 2x BoW . This was in early January. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Who would you pick to play you if they were making an EQ movie? And what is your favorite movie of all time?</span> 
<br />Well, this is actualyl a tough question but id probably want to play Zebuxoruk =p. 
<br />
<br />Well, I dont really have a favorite Movie of all time so im going to do favorite Game of all time. 
<br />
<br />My Favorite game of all time would have to be Final Fantasy 2. It was the first RPG I ever played. Hell, I still remember the first time I encounterd a random battle. It scared the hell out of me. Its the one game that I have played that I can remember from begenning to end. Its also one of the few games in which I feel that all the main characters were well thought out and have actual stories behind them. Not this i'm here at the same time as you letz join up! The story of the game was great as well. It wasent one of those typical games which once you beat you wonderd, uhh its over? With this game you got a real sense of closure as well as a sense of something else could happen. It was also the first final fantasty to have summons in it, and I feel the best use of them. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyhow, forgive the mispellings =/ the compay I work fors application server is down, as well as about everything else with the company right now.

			<div class="content"><span style="color: red">Skylaa's Interview</span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Give us some basic background on your character. Is there a special meaning to your name, server, guild etc. How were you introduced to EQ and why did you choose an enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />I started playing on Bristlebane because it's the server a friend of mine was already playing on. I've no clue why really I decided on a high elf enchanter. I didnt know anything about the class or even what to put points into. I basically knew nothing about the game. I remember losing my corpse at level 4 while running through Lfay. I just wanted to explore. About level 8, I got tired of dying all the time so I started playing a warrior. I grew tired of her about level 51 and started a cleric. When I was working on the shawl quest for my cleric, I pulled out the old high elf enchanter and started leveling her up so that she could enchant the mana vials. Well I had so much fun, I decided to remake her and give her better starting stats. Since I hadn't really put the beginning points into anything useful on the old one and because I wanted to play a dark elf, I was happy to recreate my enchanter. Skylaa has been my main ever since. I still play my cleric but only as a boxed cleric when she is needed. 
<br />
<br />I met my boyfriend on EQ just over two years ago. He plays a shammie -- Dunncan MacLeod. He wanted to use Donut for our surnames but I wouldn't go for it. 
<br />
<br />I'm thinking I have about 85 AA's or so. I'm a member of The Imperium Knights guild and have been for about a year. Prior to that I was co-leader of Una Stamus and before that I was an officer in Brambled Moon. I've been playing EQ since about mid-2000. 
<br />
<br />At this point, I cannot even imagine playing anything but an enchanter. I recently started a new toon on another server and guess what? She's a dark elf enchanter. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you give a new enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />I would suggest to any new enchanter to learn all about our spells, experiment with them and ask questions in forums like this one. I would also suggest learning as much about the other classes because I think it helps us to our jobs if we know the strengths and weakness of the other classes. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have an ability/spell line from another class what would it be?</span> 
<br />
<br />I'm certain it's been mentioned that SNARE would be great. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone for straight out FUN! </span>
<br />
<br />I love pretty much any kind of dungeon/cave crawl. I prefer indoor zones. I've been having much fun in the new Chardok and in Droga. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Was there a defining moment when you fell in love with your enchanter, or was it a gradual appreciation? (Feel free to add in your favorite warstory if you want) </span>
<br />
<br />I wanted to level up my enchanter in zones different from the ones I had "grown up" in with my warrior and with my cleric so in her teens, I took her to the Lake of Ill Omen. I'd never hunted there before. I think I truly fell in love with her and gained a great appreciation for the things we can do as enchanters in there at that Sarnak Fort. Being able to AoE mezz and control all those mobs was an awesome feeling. It seemed like the more I could keep mezzed the more the puller would pull. I can remember just laughing at all the mobs and running around AoE mezzing piles of mobs while the rest of group worked on killing them. It was so much fun. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">And the most pressing question, if they were making a movie based on EQ, who would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />I'd love to say someone sexy like Halle Berry but it would prolly be someone more like Rosie Perez.

<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Let's start with the basics. What level is your enchanter? Feel free to add your server, guild info stuff like that. Does your surname have any special meaning to it? </span>
<br />I'm a 55th level Enchanter and an officer of The Divine Light on Tunare. My surename (Silvercoin) comes from when I minor illusioned as a dropped silver coin to meditate as a young enchanter hunting in the commons. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd-like powers?</span> 
<br />
<br />Fix the combat animations for Luclin models. While I'm at it, most of the Luclin female models are in desperate need of breast reduction surgery. I imagine there must be a booming market for back braces in Norrath. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Let's say you could be given a spell line or ability from another class, what would it be?</span> 
<br />
<br />I would so love to have snare, although I'd be perfectl happy with effective single target stuns. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Was there a defining moment that you fell in love with your enchanter? Or was it more of a gradual appreciation? (Feel free to add in your favorite war story to!) </span>
<br />
<br />I love my enchanter dearly, but I suspect I'm still a tank at heart. That or crazy (rune tanking Shki'nar Warriors in fungus grove when all you have to work with is Berserk Spirit). Actually, somewhere in my midteens I was hunting in the Oasis when I was invited to group with a cleric who was hunting there. She was an alt of one of my current guild's officers and was impressed enough with me to invite me into the guild. I've gotten disatisfied with my class and with EQ from time to time, but I always come back to Maes because of the wonderful people in my guild. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite movie? And if they were making an EQ movie who would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />Favorite movie is a toughie, although I'd probably go with The Last Unicorn. It's beautifully animated and just a wonderful tale. As for an actor to play Maesembra, I'd probably go with Alyson Hannigan.</div>

			<div class="content">In this weeks installment of "Enchanter of the Week" we meet the lovely <span style="color: red">Keshara </span>from the Xegony server.... 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Give us a little background on your character. What server you play on, your characters level, guild associations? What ever you want to tell us.</span> 
<br />
<br />I'm a level 65 enchanter on Xegony. I'm an officer in the guild Prism of Light, and the longest standing member besides the guild leader. We just celebrated our 3 year anniversary. It's a small guild, but they're my "family" and I wouldn't dream of being anywhere else. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Who introduced you to Everquest and why did you pick an enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />No one really "introduced" me to EverQuest. I was on a mailing list, and someone wrote in about how they hated the game, and their husband would never quit playing it, and I thought "Hm, that sounds interesting!"  
<br />
<br />The first character I played seriously was a druid. After a year and a half or so, I wanted to try something different. My guild had no active enchanters, and while I didn't know too much about them, I thought illusions sounded like a blast. (They are!) I found an enchanter to be fun, and challenging, and I love it. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could give one piece of advice to a new enchanter, what would it be? </span>
<br />
<br />This is kind of a tough question, in that I'm limited to one piece of advice. I would probably have to say... don't be afraid. Don't be afraid to jump in the middle of that mass of mobs your group just pulled and start mezzing. Don't be afraid to die. It happens. There's nothing more exhilirating than saving your group when they all thought they were going to die. I can't resist adding one more thing, though. Know all your spells like the back of your hand, so you know what spells fit what situations. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What's your favorite zone to play in for pure fun value? </span>
<br />
<br />I don't know that I really have a favorite zone to just play in, but I think that if I had to pick one, it would probably be Sebilis. It was fun when I was in my 50s, and it's still fun now at 65. It always makes me giggle to turn myself into an old model froglok and DC a froglok and run around confusing people. I still like to take 50s in my guild down and help them experience a bit once in a while. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could pick another spell line or ability from another class, what would it be? </span>
<br />
<br />There's so many! But I think I wish for snare most often. Especially since my first "main" character was a snaring class. I still miss it. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do you have a favorite quote? </span>
<br />
<br />I have a lot of quotes that I really like. But the one I like most is... really long. I like it just the same. The guy that said this is a comedian that died in 1994. I'm sorry for the length, but I feel it's most meaningful in it's entirety. 
<br />
<br />"The world is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it, you think it's real, because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round and it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud. And it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question: 'Is this real? Or is this just a ride?' And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and they say 'Hey! Don't worry, don't be afraid - ever - because... this is just a ride.' And we kill those people. 'Shut him up! We have a lot invested in this ride! Shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry; look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.' It's just a ride. But we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that - ever notice that? - and we let the demons run amok. But it doesn't matter, because... it's just a ride, and we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort. No worry. No job. No savings and money. Just a choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy bigger guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, into a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year and, instead, spend it feeding, clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would do many times over - not one human being excluded - and we can explore space together, both inner and outer, forever. In peace." -- Bill Hicks 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie based on EQ, who would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />I'm not very knowledgable about actors and actresses, but I think I would probably pick Catherine Zeta-Jones. I think she'd make a lovely erudite, Keshara's true race, or an elf, which Keshara often masquerades as.</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="color: red">KIMJA's Interview </span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Give us some background information on your character. I see you're a guild leader as well. How did you end up leading your guild? </span>
<br />
<br />A long time ago, the original leader of Moonlight Crusaders was leaving EQ. We had an officer meeting about who should hold the tag, and for some crazy reason I was the one selected. The guild flourished in the months to come, until I was forced to leave the game. The guild was disbanded, and the tag was lost. When I came back to EQ I tried being a part of another guild, but it didnt feel the same. With the help of some very close friends (and a GM or two) we were able to regain the tag and here we are 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could go back and change anything about your character what would it be? (If anything) </span>
<br />
<br />I'm pretty happy with Kimja at this time. I think the one thing I regret is keeping him Agnostic. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could be a developer for one day what aspects of EQ or the enchanter class would you change? </span>
<br />
<br />That's tough. The realease of LDoN has returned some of the old fire to EQ. I think I would instance every dungeon in the game! 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have another classes ability or spell line what would it be? </span>
<br />
<br />That's easy. Gimme the nukes! To have the power of a Wizard would be incredible! I'm really not power hungry, promise 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite quote? </span>
<br />
<br />"A coward dies a thousand deaths, a soldier dies but once" - Tupac Shakur 
<br />
<br />Uh oh. This has been the topic of many threads on the Quellious Flame boards Im a huge fan of Tupac Shakur, and this quote is something he said paraphrasing Shakespeare. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">And I always have to ask this!! If they were making a movie about Everquest who would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />Easy, Cuba Gooding Jr! I think the resemblance is astounding!</div>

<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">First give us some basic information about your character. Server, level, anything you want to tell us. </span>
<br />
<br />Greetings! I am , an Enchanter of the 49th level. I hail from the Quellious server, and the great city of Felwithe as well. I have chosen to follow Tunare, and have not been disappointed in so doing. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have an ability line from another class what would it be? </span>
<br />
<br />Castable snare. Yes, this would be grossly overpowering, but the question didn't give limits For something more realistic, maybe a better mana tap or a group mana tap. I like this spell line a lot. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Let's say you were a developer for a day, what would you do with you Gawd-like powers? </span>
<br />
<br />After killing every halfling in Norrath, I'd probably take a look at the Epic quests, and the insane drop rates for certain pieces and/or spawn timers for certain monsters. Epics should be of uniform difficulty in my opinion and that is definitely not the case in practice. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Was your love for your Enchanter one that grew over time, or was there a particular defining moment? --&gt; feel free to add in a story </span>
<br />
<br />My Enchanter was not my first character, and still is not my primary character, but she's one of the most fun to play. She was created along with a Wizard and Mage, all in the same day, because I wanted to try the INT-caster classes out. The latter two, however, are still level 12, so you can guess which one piqued my interest. I very much enjoy playing my Enchanter...even at level 49, there are things I can do with a partner that neither of my primaries (both 65) could do with the same partner. My fiance and I play together, so this works perfectly for us. I expect to level quite a bit the next few weeks! 
<br />
<br />My focus has been sticking to dungeons as much as possible, because in my opinion that is where an Enchanter can really shine. (Plus, it's fun to derail a potentially fatal train when you had nowhere to run to begin with!) 
<br />

<br />
<br />Honestly, I like the way it is now. I'm by no means experienced enough in the class to make suggestions as far as class evolution goes.

<br />
<br />I'd play myself. That way they couldn't sneak in any lame-ass lines like "It's time to slay the dragon!"</div>

			<div class="content">Our interview with <span style="color: darkblue"> Twizlewink</span>
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">~How did you end up with your character name? </span>
<br />
<br />My original name was Gedal Ogiona on Xev server. Gedal is from Ged, from a Wizard of earthsea and Ogiona is for Ogion from the same book. One of my favorite books of all time. 
<br />
<br />After I transfered to 7th hammer the name Gedal was taken, and the afronting x they amended to my name needed to go. I petitioned and with the help of a good friend came up with Twizlewink Wizzletink, a very good gnomish name which I'm very proud of (Thanks to Kelia/Daphni!) 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">~How did you get started playing EQ and why did you choose an Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />I heard about EQ from some friends in Starcraft, so I looked it up on the net just about the time it was coming out of beta. I followed the game for a year or so before I started to think about playing. 
<br />
<br />My roomate then got an account, so I started a halfing druid to goof off with while he was at work. I learned a bit about the game and made some friends while I was at it. 
<br />
<br />When the time came for me to get my own account I knew I wanted two things - to be powerful and to be desireable for raids and groups. I made a cleric and an enchanter in the same day, and played both in tandem to level 14. I realized the cleric didn't give me exactly what I wanted so I abandoned him and worked on the enchanter full time. I've never regreted it since, I picked the class best suited to my personality. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">~Was there a defining moment that you fell in love with your enchanter? Or was it a gradual appreciation? -&gt; Feel free to add in a favorite story! </span>
<br />
<br />Unrest, level 16 and I'd just gotten Breeze. I met a group, a cleric/pally two box, a ranger, and a druid. The two box had a high level charecter and started to pull out of the house. Things got heated, but I was ready with my freshly scribed AE mez. We buffed up and he started to pull, and I mean PULL. First two or three just to test the waters, but by the end it was 6-8 mobs every pull, the group flowed, the exp flowed and he was so impressed we made plans to group the next night. By the end of the week I had my first guild. 
<br />
<br />I had a second defineing moment, when I was stuggling looking for fun content around level 25 and all everyone wanted to do was LOIO and OT neither of which appealed to me. A friend said "check out velious, should be ok with a few level 30 people" so I grabbed my friends and dragged them to Crystal Caverns for what was the best dungeon I've ever had the pleasure of crawling. I did 25 to 40 there without misssing a beat, numerous deaths to tell me I was working super hard. That's when I fell in love with EQ. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">~Do you like the direction recent expansions have taken the Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />I think the last two expansions really took alot of the fun out of being an enchanter. I loved that PoP brought charm to the front rather then mezzing but post nerf I just found I couldn't find fun things to do like I was once able to challenge myself. The largest indication of this to me was the reduction in my playtime. I went for a every day player to a once a week or so player and even then it's just alot of chatting with friends. EQIM is as good as EQ for me these days. I've had a good run, so I'm not bitter about it at all.  
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">~What would you like to see 6 months down the road? </span>
<br />
<br />I'd like to see Mez bounce less in general in the elementals+, and probably a longer duration mez AA. I like the divine arbitartion idea for an AA in terms of mana for enchanters where it would balance the groups mana out. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">~What advice would you give a new Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Play for fun. If you don't like buffing, don't do buffing AA. If you don't like charming don't do charming AA. If a group isn't fun because someone is a jerk bow out even if they don't have a replacment. In the end it's a game and the joy it brings should be your focus. I'm a member of a heavy raiding guild and I didn't bother with MGB till near my 200th AA, because buffing wasn't what I enjoyed doing at all. It keeps the game vibrant and fun which is the point, right? 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">~If they were making a movie about Everquest, who would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />Hrmm tough call, an RL movie about EQ I'd pick Hugh Grant since he looks alot like me and carries himself the same way (plus he's got a way with the ladies, an accurate representation) 
<br />
<br />For my charecter I'd pick Sarah Jessica Parker. She's cute and short and fun as hell just like Twiz. Thanks for the interview!</div>

			<div class="content">This week The Runes interviews <span style="color: darkblue"><span style="font-weight: bold">Ted the Chanter</span></span>
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Starting with the basics; tell us a bit about your character. What server, guilds etc </span>
<br />
<br />My enchanter is a level 65. I've been level topped out since early 2002, and stopped AAing with purpose at around 180 AAs in April. I particularly hate the grind of levelling, and always try to get it over with quickly. Part of that is my play style--I do short, unplanned EQ sessions almost every day. Mostly these days I do trade skills, quests, and LDoN adventures. 
<br />
<br />I've spent a lot of time playing around with EQ game mechanics and reverse engineering the EQ program. I am a real-life software gearhead, so those things interest me. In particular I did a lot of discovery on the experience and faction systems. People often knock Sony for thier code being bug-ridden and poorly tested, but I disagree. Compared to many commercial applications, Everquest is a marvel of security, client syncronization, communications efficiency, and stability. 
<br />
<br />I am in an Avatar-of-War level guild on the Rathe server, who I won't name in order to disassociate them from my crimes against the Everquest EULA. (rofl) 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you get started playing EQ, and how did you end up with an Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />I started playing EQ in beta in 1998, when my friend gave me his beta account. Today is coincidentally, my 5th year anniversary playing EQ. I've seen an amazing development of the game in that time. I really have to credit the Verant and Sony teams for keeping it going. The PoP and LDoN expansions are imaginative and durable, in spite of what some critics say. 
<br />
<br />I played several classes in beta, but primarily enchanter. When Live time came, I was unhappy with the unfinished state of the enchanter so I played other classes. A year later, I made my live server enchanter for tradeskills. I found that levelling on the way to get to enchant platinum was more fun than casting Cheal or pressing auto-attack, so I stuck with the enchanter. In today's EQ the enchanter is the most flexible and useful class there is. I could never play a melee in today's game. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have a spell/ability line from another class what would it be? </span>
<br />
<br />Feign Death, of course, and as a skill, not a spell. That get-out-of-jail-free card is just too shiny to resist. (lol) 
<br />
<br />A close second would be Shroud of Stealth. I like to explore, and there are some places that enchanters just can't go alone. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you were a developer for one day, what would you do with your Gawd-like powers? </span>
<br />
<br />The first thing that I'd do is restore the faction system to effectiveness. I would reset faction limits to +/-32,000, like they were before the mid-Luclin client change. Having a maximum faction capped at 1200 is punitive to players who try to maintain thier faction against Guild Raids. Having the low cap at -3000 is an insufficient hole for those who really wish to dig a deep one. I would restore faction effects to all non-player illusions, including shamen and druid ones. I would also add appropriate antagonisms, so that those darned bears would die just like enchanters do if we go the wrong place in the wrong form. In conjunction with this, I would revamp the Old World cities to be raid-worthy and quest-worthy in a manner similar to Velious. 
<br />
<br />The second thing that I would do is fix up the melee system so that melees are less boring and more effective. I would make the two prime melee stats (agility and dexterity) that have little effect on melee performance worth raising. I would also correct the Armor Class system so that the point of diminishing returns was not so sharp and easily reached. Coupled with some appropriately high AC gear introductions for warriors, this would give them back the tanking role they deserve. I would also move monks to a higher damage table and give them some bigger damage spike offensive abilities. I'd add more 'eye candy' disciplines for all melees, with 5-10 minute use times. 
<br />
<br />The third thing I would do is give shamen and monks a good nerfing (lol)and add a few abilities to other classes. Cannibalize would come out of game--if manaconvert is too good for clerics and mages, it's too good for shamen. Feign Death as an instant skill breaks the game, so out it comes. Monks would be relegated to a 3 second cast FD that requires a trivial cost reagant. I'd give druids a 25% rez at level 40, a 50% rez at level 60, and a 75% one at level 65. Wizards would get a couple more level 65 spells, including that better DD they all want and mass teleport to thier own bind spot. I'd introduce more questable bane spells for all nukers--Akhevabane, Elementalbane, Wurmbane, Gnomebane, etc. 
<br />
<br />Enchanters would get an innate, resistable Dire Charm skill at levels 20, 40, and 65 for level-15 mobs. I'd also do away with that mean ole Dire charm experience penalty. I'd add a resistable -60MR debuff at level 63, and an additional 30% buff extension AA. I'd take away Lightning Reflexes--it mitigates too much, and causes misses too seldom--and replace it with a pure dodge AA skill. I'd add general spell aggro reducer focus items I-IV, ENC only. I'd make some +25 int items that aren't too hard to get at level 50, and I'd up the HP/Mana/Int on all PoP tradeskilled silks by 30% across the board. I'd add Bear and Wolf form to the enchanter illusion portfolio, along with thier effects. 
<br />
<br />That's a big day, isn't it? I've had a long time to think about this, I guess. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What goals do you have for your character that you have not reached yet?</span> 
<br />
<br />I'd really like a decent level 65ish robe. I've been thwarted by drops at getting anything better than a PoG robe for almost 2 years. 
<br />
<br />I'd like to get into the Elemental Planes some day. It's hard when you have a guild full of casual players. You have to make do with fewer, smaller raids that go shorter. The serious people tend to leave for the top guilds all the time, too. Maybe that's next year's goal. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie about EQ, who would you pick to play you?</span> 
<br />
<br />Uma Thurman, because she looks like my character. ROFL.</div>

			<div class="content">This week The Runes, interviews <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">Vizier</span></span>!
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How did you get started playing EQ, and how did you end up with an Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Well this guy I used to work with kept tellin me about EQ at work and since ive always enjoyed RPGs he talked me into trying it. This is way before Kunark was out. Pretty much all down hill from there. I leveled a paladin to level 56, got tired of LFG all the time so I knew my next char was gonna be either Clr or Enc. Clr seemed fairly boring on the surface so I cashed in my RBG and never looked back. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you could have a spell line or ability from another class what would it be? </span>
<br />
<br />FD plz~ 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your favorite zone to play in for pure fun factor? </span>
<br />
<br />Well way back in the day I lived in lguk. To this day I have tons of fond memories of mezzing trains that looked like certain death. I also have fond memories of getting destroyed by some of those same trains but going down mezzing! These days you can usually find me in LDoN high risk missions or maybe duoing Tactics arm supp camp with a druid. 
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What advice would you give someone starting their first Enchanter? </span>
<br />
<br />Enjoy it. Leveling up my enchanter from scratch was a blast. You can never really go back and have those same experiences over again. Have fun and dont get too caught up in worrying about gear or money. It will come. Oh and max your cha before your int  
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Was your love for your Enchanter a gradual appreciation, or was there a defining moment where you sat back and went, "WOW!" &lt;--- Feel free to add in your favorite war story!! </span>
<br />
<br />I remember one particular fight in theld Cazic Thule when it was for lvl 30 or so. I had just zoned in and shouted i was lfg. Miliseconds later I hear "COME TO LTR NOW" (lower throne room camp). Well I hauled butt over there and the scene that laid before me was chaos. 
<br />
<br />Easily 12 mobs scattered thru the courtyard, and the group losing ground rapidly. First thing I do is spam f8 and click aoe mez. BOOM 5 mobs locked. The tank seemed to be fairly twinked out so hes actaully still alive at this point but going down fast. I get into the thick of things and color shift, by some miracle all the mobs get stunned. 
<br />
<br />Now about this time it dawns on me that im still not grouped and in about 4 second im going to get the pummeling of a life time with prolly no heals. Acting on pure instinct at this point I target mysel and aoe mez again. BOOM another 5 mezzed only now im mezzed too! However, not long after I cast the spell stun wears off some un mezzed mob and they break me out of my own mez (yay!.) I back off and start casting aoe mez into the pile to lock down any strays. 
<br />
<br />After that the group started picking them off rapidly one at a time. In a few minutes it was all over...everyone alive and my heart pounding like crazy. The whole group cheered me and thanked me over and over. Looking back that was the most exciting fight Ive had that I didnt get any exp for.  
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If they were making a movie based on EQ, who would you pick to play you? </span>
<br />
<br />Well ppl tell all the time I look exactly like Matthew Broderick so I guess him.</div>
