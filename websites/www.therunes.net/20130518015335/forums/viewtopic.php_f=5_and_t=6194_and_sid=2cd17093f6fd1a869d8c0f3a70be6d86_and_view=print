				<div class="date"><img src="./styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Oct 15th, '04, 09:41</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Bellanfear</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I just thought I would repost another short guide that I made.
<br />
<br />Here's my guide for halflings with no attention span.
<br />
<br />Get a tradeskillable augment, Trean Flies OR Slugworms (depending on the augment), and Dust of Discord OR Discordant Scoriae (depending on if you want the second best or the best type of augment).  Then bug an enchanter, shaman/rogue, and a smith until they give up the details.
<br />
<br />Here's my guide for those of us who aren't halflings yet also don't like tradeskills, but want to know how to take advantage of this.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Introduction</span>
<br />
<br />There are four steps to making a tradeskill augment if you want to make an augment of the most powerful kind.  Three of these steps could cause you to lose the augment, and all of these steps could cause you to lose a (rare) dropable item that isn't sold at vendors.  You can stop and equip your augment at any point in this process, but it will be attuned and you will not be able to further enhance it.  The steps, in order, are Jewelcrafting, Alchemy/Poison Making, Smithing, and Alchemy/Poison Making.  Here's a quick overview of how to make a generic augment of the best possibile quality.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 1: Jewelcrafting</span>
<br />
<br />Combine the augment with a 52 plat Fine Hydroabrasive (bought in PoK) and a Gem Cutter.
<br />
<br />Example:  <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=13250" class="postlink">Radiant Cut Voidflow Stone</a>
<br />
<br />Recommendations: Have an enchanter with JCM3 & Salvage 3 do this combine.
<br />
<br />Drops needed: The only droppables here are augments.  You can see what these are and where these drop on either eqtraders or allakhazam.  They have different databases, so pick and choose what to believe.  You obviously only need one of these.

<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 2 - Alchemy/Poison Making</span>
<br />
<br />This step requires either Alchemy or Poison Making.  There are recipies for both skills that produce the same result.  The trivials are extremely close and almost identical in terms of success rates, but in the cases where they differ Poison Making gives you a better chance of success.  The vendor bought components come to a total of XXX plat and there are several subcombines that could increase your prices.
<br />
<br />Example:  <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=14984" class="postlink">Radiant Voidflow of Minor Haste</a>
<br />
<br />Recommendations:  The best possible success rate would come from an alchemist with Alchemy Master 3, Salvage 3, and an <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12413" class="postlink">Umbracite Swarm Orb</a>, but I don't believe we have one of those in the guild.  In any case, there are probably very few of those in the game, perhaps one in Memento Reejeryn or Semper Simul or any other guild that has farmed VT.  A more realistic recommendation would be a shaman with just Alchemy Mastery 3 & Salvage 3 AAs or a rogue with Poison Mastery 3 and Salvage 3.  
<br />
<br />Drops Needed: Again only one drop is needed.
<br />
<br />slugworms (<a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=16093&menustr=035000000000" class="postlink">eqtraders</a>, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31583" class="postlink">allakhazam</a>) for the XXXXflow stone augments.
<br />trean flies (<a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=16094&menustr=035000000000" class="postlink">eqtraders</a>, allakhazam) for the non-flow stone augments.
<br />
<br />Mark Descriptions: The mark you choose is what determines the effect of the augment.  They are all vendor purchaseable in the western trader building in PoK or various other places where alchemy and poison merchants are such as Abysmal Sea.  Here's a listing of the marks and the effects they would add.  The caster focus effects are level 3 at the minor level, 4 at the intermediate level and 5 at the best level.  The melee enhancement effects are level 1 at the minor level, 2 at the intermediate level and 3 at the best level.  The Mark of Sight can give Faerune at the best level.  I recommend <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=18403" class="postlink">this post on the eqtraders forums.</a>
<br />
<br />Mark of Aggression - Improved Damage
<br />Mark of Alacrity - Enhancement Haste
<br />Mark of Battle - Attack
<br />Mark of Celerity - Affliction Haste
<br />Mark of Dexterity - Improved Dodge
<br />Mark of Efficiency - Mana Preservation
<br />Mark of Extension - Extended Enhancement
<br />Mark of Ferocity - Ferocity
<br />Mark of Haste - Haste
<br />Mark of Healing - Improved Healing
<br />Mark of Potency - Affliction Efficiency
<br />Mark of Quickness - Spell Haste
<br />Mark of Sight - Vision
<br />Mark of Sundering - Cleave
<br />Mark of Virility - Burning Affliction
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 3 - Smithing</span>
<br />
<br />This is a single smithing combine with 2 vendor bought components and one dropped one.
<br />
<br />Example: <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=13180" class="postlink">Black Gold Inlay</a>
<br />
<br />Recommendations:  Any smith with Smithing Mastery 3 and Salvage 3 would be your best bet.
<br />
<br />Drops Needed:  The inlay used for the highest level of combines is the Black Gold Inlay which requires a Discordant Scoriae (<a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=16090&menustr=035000000000" class="postlink">eqtraders</a>, allakhazam).  Alternatively, you could use Dust of Discord (<a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=16089&menustr=035000000000" class="postlink">eqtraders</a>, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31736" class="postlink">allakhazam</a>) to make a White Gold Inlay which can be used to make the second best player made augments in the game.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 4 - Alchemy/Poison Making</span>
<br />
<br />Very simple.  Combine the Inlay from the last step and your Radiant Minor aug from step 2.  This will give you one of the best possible player made augments in the game.  Note that failure only results in the loss of the Inlay.
<br />
<br />Example:  <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=15104&menustr=080010500400" class="postlink">Radiant Voidflow of Pure Haste</a>
<br />
<br />Recommendations:  Same recommendations as for step 2.
<br />
<br />Drops Needed: No additional drops are needed for this step.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Conclusions</span>
<br />
<br />I highly recommend following the recommendations to the letter for these combines.  These are all very high trivial combines that pretty much require the AAs to be able to succeed at a decent rate.  If you have to pay a service fee, fine, but here's a few things to know.  I usually charge about 10-15% of the item's bazaar price for combines for those whom I don't know.  I'm not sure what I would do a final combine for if I were a Shaman/Rogue, but 5k would sound like a minimum to me.  If you are going with someone you don't know, be aware that there's no group message for salvaged items yet.  This means they could fail the combine and salvage part of it without your knowledge.  I'll try and update this list with the people who meet my recommended skill on this server.  Also, be prepared to fail.  I have failed a number of these, luckily only one was with an important augment.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">I don't have the full price lists yet, but I'll try and add the prices of the components to the steps that require vendor bought components when I can.  Also, if there's no item link, it's because it didn't exist at the time of this writing.  I'll try and update them further as I can.</span></div>

				<div class="content">This is a nice complete guide.  That's needed for the tradeskiller, but it's not so much for the non-tradeskiller.
<br />
<br />Since it's so complete, it requires good reading comprehension.  For instance, at the beginning you say "Get a tradeskillable augment, Trean Flies OR Slugworms (depending on the augment), and Dust of Discord OR Discordant Scoriae (depending on if you want the second best or the best type of augment)."  This sentence requires parsing commas, AND operators, and OR operators.  It would be simpler if this sentence was broken out into three seperate bullet points.
<br />
<br />Also, when a guide is this long people tend to cut-and-paste the charts out of it.  So the note about flowstones needing slugworms and others needing trean flies should be incorporated into the list of stones, so it's not easily seperated.
<br />
<br />Finally, it's not a good idea to talk about 'best focus effect' and 'second-best focus effects'.  This is vague at best, but actually quite misleading when compared to Time focuses that offer much more than 15% bonuses.  Just be more specific, call them focus 5 and focus 4 effects.</div>

Calling them focus 5 and focus 4 was exactly what I wanted to avoid because there are many things you can make that don't fall into that category.  Examples include things like the Mark of Vision which could create Ultravision, Plainsight, or Faerune effects or the Mark of Haste which could give 20%, 30%, or 40% haste.  In fact, refering to them as level 4 and level 5 would really be problematic because melee effects such as Improved Dodge are possible, but only in levels 1, 2, and 3 as opposed to 3, 4, and 5.  Basically, I didn't want to refer to all 15 of the possible effects as level 3, 4, and 5 effects because there are 6 effects where that would be at the best unintelligile and at the worst misleading.  
<br />
<br />Overall, I recommend doing what you want with it.  If you make a better guide, that's less I have to explain to people asking me what to do.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":)" title="icon_biggrin.gif" />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">edit - I do have plans for updating the guide.  I would like to talk about the slots the augments fit in and prices of the components when I get time.  I expect to have those added sometime this week.</span></div>
