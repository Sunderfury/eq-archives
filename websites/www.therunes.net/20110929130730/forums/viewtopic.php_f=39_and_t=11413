			<div class="content">I used to have a lot of fun when I grouped for the first time on this enchanter (was in PoI since nobody play below lvl 50 anymore). I had lots of fun cause I could keep a charmed pet and I do had to CC often since we had to move in the zone. We had to deal with re-pop and roamer. I was praised with &quot;your going to be a good enchanter later on&quot; and &quot;I'll put you in myf riend list&quot;.<br /><br />But now that I am lvl 62, my highest charm is working on lvl 57max and everuone do group in CoD wich has almost nothing to charm (sometime a lvl 40's do spawn but tis dead befour I can even think to charm it). Also we never seems to get adds (maybe its because the zone is always crowded ) but well even when we get an add it just 1 and they hit for so low that I don,t even bother to mezz them anymore. Anyway the necro probably already got it doted or the mage (that class is now a very popular one since they can solo so well with a merc) is too busy spaming his spell on the add while his pet is tanking it.<br /><br />So I am down to standing in the back, Casting Tash, cripple then my insanly to slow DD spell for mediocre DPS. ( I don,t even bother with slow anymore since the merc mana bar never go down below 80%).<br /><br />I heard about enchanter beeing puller in higher lvl. When does it hapen ? wich AA do I need ? When will I be able to show that I worth a spot in a  group beside of buffing ?<br /><br />P.S. Yeah I know that I did a very logn post for almost nothing but I am bored while theya re patching Everquest  <img src="./images/smilies/new_newbie.gif" alt="new_newbie.gif" title="new_newbie.gif" /></div>

			<div class="content">An unfortunate consequence of the way enchanters are linked to level caps means that as content becomes &quot;easier&quot; due to gear inflation and people start hunting in higher level zones at lower levels, that the match up between our level caps and the content isn't always very good.  You're in one of those spots now.  CoD was originally a relatively 'advanced'  PoP zone, requiring raid target kills for access.  Now it's an open zone.<br /><br />Levelling to 64 should solve most of your problems.  And I'll go wave my &quot;enchanter level caps in the 50's and 60's are idiotic&quot; flag in front of the devs again and see if anyone notices.</div>

Develop your own style tips and tricks, and have fun.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Learn to pull, if their is one thing I have learned from playing EQ and making friends is know when your group isn't functioning at 100% efficiency.  I'm &quot;old school&quot; in the sense I learned my enchanting skills from another board but those tidbits on &quot;how&quot; to pull have made me the envy of any group, on my chanty or main.<br /><br />Currently what I do now (and using whats above):<br />1) Know your group!  You have to know everything about your group, probally more so than any other class.  Some things are simple, like, is your tank even breaking a sweat?  If the mobs are swinging and your tank thinks the NPC is tickling him, you need more mobs.  How is the healer's mana?  If the healer is OoM all the time or everytime he heals he gets heal agro, adjust how many mobs are in camp generating agro while they sit waiting to die.  This also tells you something about the Tank if the healer isn't intentionally drawing agro, <span style="font-weight: bold">ADJUST</span>!  Some of the harder things are their competency levels, their familiarity with their class, and what spells they actually have mem'd.  I say this only cause I've grouped with people in there 70's and they had no spells from 61-70 due to how the spell system works and they refused to use the /bazaar or hunt their own spells &quot;cause they couldn't get group to farm the spells.&quot;  Or, they never knew that mellee got &quot;spells&quot; in the form of tombs.  These are the people who make PUG's a nightmare, but help these people out and you will soon make good freinds if they are serious about EQ.<br /><br />2) Once you know your group, <span style="font-weight: bold">learn the zone</span>!  Running around in a zone invisible, before advertising your LFG or even soloing in a zone you know you will probally getting a group in, is amazing knowlege.  The speed NPC's run at, pathing (is it good, bad, or average.  Any neat tricks you can use zone walls for?, do they like warping?), do they &quot;suicide walk&quot;, respawn time, assist range, casters i.e. who are healers (usually a hint in their name but not always), their DPS, HP's, and AC are all valuable things to know about a mob.  And their is enouph variation to keep it far from boring.<br /><br />3) Now you know your group and you know the zone.  Pull!  Don't ask, don't mention anything, just start parking mobs at the groups door step!  This is probally the hardest part in all honesty.  If you have in-experienced people, they will panic!  Relax them by keeping the situation under-control.  Ive been evac'd, yelled at, had tanks so worried that they became inept at how to break mez correctly.  Calm them down, show them everything is locked down, your in control of the situation, and they need to focus on one mob at a time.  Once the jitters are out of their system, you will notice less group chat as people become &quot;lean, mean, killing machines!&quot;.<br /><br />Something to mention here, bad things can happen here at step 3, as a chanty you need to become comfortable dieing if crap really hits the fan and not wiping group.  If you panic it will spread to the group.  As you become more comfortable pulling and knowing the zone, it wont happen nearly as often but taking &quot;one for the gipper&quot; is also very important.  My most memorable pull &quot;of all time&quot; was Inner KC linking agro with Tower 1 in KC because the inner group wiped.  That led to close to 25 mobs in total running for my group.  Thankfully pathing was horrible and most of my group survived because I was alert while I was pulling and knew a disaster was about to happen.  It wasn't so munch my fault for the &quot;chain agro&quot; problem but I kept those 25 mobs VERY busy while my group zoned out.  A rez later and we where back at killing mobs for xp.<br /><br />One other things, monks and bards hate it when we pull.  Learn to LOVE the hate  <img src="./images/smilies/5slick.gif" alt="5slick.gif" title="5slick.gif" /><br /><br />4) Things I find useful.  Tash, Mez, Root, PB AoE Mez (W/Mez Mastery), Blur, and Despell.  I change things up as needed but my favorite thing to do was:<br />a) Tash (I use to pull, I rarely use Pacy unless 2+ will chew through rune and me too quickly, <span style="font-weight: bold">know your zone</span>!)<br />b) Mez<br />c) Slow<br />d) Blur<br />rinse and re-repeat.<br /><br />I use Root and PB AoE Mez as additional control methods.  Blur still is highly unreliable for me (no AA's to improve its chances of success yet) so Root is always a &quot;just in case&quot; use.  Despell I switch in and out, and usually its more &quot;out&quot; than &quot;in&quot; but...<br /><br />Leadership AA's that I have found very handy besides the obviose HoTT...<br />Spell awareness - Helps with &quot;learning your group above&quot;, knowing when a mob is going to &quot;gate&quot; or &quot;CH&quot; in combination with audio triggers is HUGE!, and knowing what is going on in general is big.  Remember, you have to know your group better than they know it.<br /><br />Mark NPC - Putting a &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, or &quot;3&quot; above a Mez'd mobs head takes all the guess work out of &quot;what mob should we fight next?&quot; from your group.<br /><br />Spell Awareness - Knowing what buffs are on a mob and how long mez is going to last takes all the &quot;counting to 45&quot; so you &quot;have to re-apply mez&quot; out of the equation.  Heck, people download UI's to tell them when mez is about to wear off! I used the old counting to 45 in my head, and occasionally out loud and had friends in the living room think I was crazy.  With this AA, you know how long mez has, no more counting  <img src="./images/smilies/toothy10.gif" alt=":D" title="toothy10.gif" /> , you know what is being done to it (read #1), and with Slow being mitigated to crap, knowing if a mob is hasted, so you can depsell it makes the mob that munch slower.<br /><br />5) Know when a Monk or Bard is better for pulling.  It's hard, and twiddling your fingers is annoying, but if your out of your league and you don't have the skills/spells for the zone find other usefull things you can do for the group.<span style="font-weight: bold"> Know the zone</span>!<br /><br />In CoD at 65 (my current level), as an example, I usually have 3-5 mobs in camp at all times.  This is mostly due to gear inflation but it keeps groups busy and the only down time is when I have to wait on respawns.  As a chanty I have full elaborate defiant and been too lazy (and cheap) to upgrade my jewlery to Dwerium or SoF rings.  I rarely have any cleric or druid buff, mostly cause I forget to ask for it and just keep our Self HP buff and Rune on at all times.  I have pulled in every zone I have ever XP'd in except WoS.  The zone I hated pulling in the most was Seb (well any zone where 50% of your pulls are casters, so they spend more time casting than chasing you, but you learn alot about LoS and pulling so it's not all bad).  The funnest zones I remember pulling in are LDoN's and KC for some background.</div>
