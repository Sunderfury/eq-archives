One of the first we’ll be talking about is Research Assistants.<br /><br />These hardworking researchers will help you acquire upgrades to your spells and combat arts while you’re off adventuring in the deepest darkest dungeon or asleep in your own warm cozy bed. Even though they’re hardworking, they’re not a speedy service and they are limited in how much they’ll help you. Because this kind of research is complicated, they’ll only be able to work on one spell or combat art for one character per server.<br /><br />All research requires a base amount of information to work with. In the case of the Research Assistants, this manifests in that they require you to have the previous tier of the spell being upgraded before they can begin work for you. So, in order to research that Master I, you’ll need to first know the Adept III version, though it doesn’t matter whether that Adept III version came from researching or from your friendly neighborhood sage, jeweler or alchemist. The time required to research a spell increase will vary based on the level and tier of the spell. A level 20 Adept I may only take an hour, while a level 80 master will likely take a month or longer.<br /><br />We’re still working out the details of how these assistants will work in Norrath and we want to hear your feedback. Do you have a preference on how these researchers would look or how you interact with them?<br /><br />All those and anything else you’d like to share with us is welcome feedback in this thread!<br /><br />- Kirstie</div></blockquote><br /><br />EQ2 fansite blog commentary<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://fanfaire08.feldoncentral.com/2009/03/03/research-assistants-for-those-hard-to-find-masters/">http://fanfaire08.feldoncentral.com/200 ... d-masters/</a><!-- m --></div>
