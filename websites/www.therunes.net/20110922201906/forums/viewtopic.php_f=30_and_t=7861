			<div class="content">Ive been playing and its been fun
<br />
<br />max amount people in a group is 4 (as game progesses.. max is 8)
<br />- can be other players
<br />- can be computer controlled henchman
<br />
<br />
<br />I made a small section devoted to GuildWars at my messageboard

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />quick recap
<br />- game is not focused on levelling and gear, level cap is 20  (and will not raise)
<br />- plenty of PvE content - not just a PvP game
<br />- <span style="font-weight: bold">all PvP is team based</span>, there is no "one on one" pvp
<br />- no monthly fees
<br />- expansions every 6 months
<br />
<br />
<br />this being said,
<br />will I like being forever 20 ?
<br />
<br />Dunno -- but its an interesting concept  :twisted:

<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>"It's more like StarCraft than a traditional MMO," explains ArenaNet Founder and Director, Jeff Strain. This is no surprise: ArenaNet's founding fathers defected from Blizzard to start the new company, with the goal of bringing its Battle.net experience to a new genre. <br /><br />As a result Guild Wars might look like a traditional fantasy role-playing game, but it's got a unique feel. "It's more of a strategy game with persistence of characters," Strain says. "It's something that really hasn't been done with competitive RPGs." <br /><br />In short, the game isn't about how buffed your character is or how much armor and lewt you've collected. <br /><br />It's a game about fast tactics and teamplay, either against computer-controlled monsters or other players. <br /><br />As a result, intense games of guild-vs.-guild combat feel a little more like games of Quake clan arena, old-school TeamFortress, or Counter-Strike: matches move quickly and the teams with a plan quickly overcome uncoordinated mobs of players. </div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">I started playing last night and so far I like it a lot (then again, after one day I like most anything). The graphics are beautiful, a little like Lineage2 but more stylized with less anime influence.  So far the gameplay has been straightforward and I haven't had difficulty learning "what to do."  My only real complaint is that I cannot access everything in the environment.  The world has predefined paths and you can roam along the path but cannot sometimes go far from it - invisible walls exist.  A friend noted that my MMO exposure has jaded me to the more FPS-type environments.  Also, had I not read the review by a friend who plays lots of games, I would have felt the world was very empty since the lower level instancing is usually solo.  But it apparently changes in a big way in a few levels.  Here is what Vestas had to say:
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Welcome to Guild Wars. First, be aware, this is a game the centers itself on guild activity. It is expected that you will join a guild. As the name implies, PvP combat is prevalent in the game though before you panic, it is entirely goal focused, there is no such thing as "PK'ing" or "Griefing" in this game because the areas in which you will face other players are more like Quake matches then MMORPG standard fare.<br /><br />Character Creation<br /><br />There are six classes, Warrior, Ranger, Monk, Elementalist, Mesmer and Necromancer. Most are self explanatory and are in some way shape or form a derivation on Everquestian themes. Monks however are actually the "healers" of the game. Every class can solo, partially due to the power of the class, partially due to the way the gameplay works (more on that later). The beauty of the system is that you will be forced to choose a "secondary" class, so in actuality you become some pairing of the above classes making about 30 total possible choices.<br /><br />The subclassing system is fairly elegant. When you first start out and explore the world you will have the opportunity to try any subclass for as long as you like. You can switch back and forth between different sub-classes (provided you journey to the requisite trainers) to test each as you see fit. At some point you will be forced to cement your decision, the upside being access to more abilities.<br /><br />Abilities, or skills, are the other key concept to character growth. There are two kinds. First is your Hero Skills, much like an MMO this is a skill point system allowing you to place points you earn as you level into various skills which have various effects (generally positive) on your characters abilities. As a general rule your class has a primary attribute which is most common throughout all of it's inherant abilities. Warriors for example, have "Strength" as one of their skills. If you take a class as a secondary, you will not have access to its primary attribute, which will effect how good you are at your secondary class (and is what clearly defines a secondary class from a primary one).<br /><br />The second set of skills are the real bread and butter of the game. You may choose to call these combat arts, or spells or attacks or whatever you wish. They server the same purpose and reportedly, there are over 100 such for each class (meaning you could learn nearly 200 skills). Many are derivations of each other. The catch here is that like EQ1, you can only have 8 active at any time and you can only change them when in town or when you earn new ones. Basically before you begin any adventure, you choose a set of skills from your primary and secondary class to set out with. The choices you make are tactical in nature. Like a complex card game, you want to pick skills that maximize your power in useful combinations. I can't beging to explain how elegant the system is. On one hand it limits your character (balance) and on the other allows your character a huge amount of available diversity.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Gameplay itself is a double-edged sword. The first several levels of the game feel very "standard faire" for any MMORPG. You'll notice a few odd twists at the start. For one, other than in town, it's a lonely world. That's right, when you go adventure you are given your own instance. The upside is that no one can interfere with your playtime. There is no camping, no spawn jumping, etc. If you have a quest and you're in the right spot the mob or object you need will be there garaunteed. You can of course choose to adventure in a group but it is not necessary in the early part of the game. You will only meet people, and can only form groups in towns.<br /><br />As a result, the first several levels felt kind of dull. You spend your time doing the usual, grabbing a plethora of quests and pursuing them, exploring the world and learning the mechanics. Initially there aren't many options open to you and you will feel very constrained, even potentially underpowered. In my opinion this is unfortunate, for a game that relies so heavily on choices, it is perhaps a bit too controlled at the start and can leave you feeling a bit underwhelmed.<br /><br />Thankfully things change if you stick with it. After the first few levels you'll choose a sub class and can, when you're ready, leave the pristine newbie lands for what the player base calls "The Real" game. And this is where you get your first taste of Guild Wars Gameplay.<br /><br />Your first real quest starts with a short and amusing training round. You sign up for the "academy" and wait your turn (a timer starts). When your turn is up you are zoned into a waiting area. An NPC gives you a lecture and when he tells you that you will be facing other students he is not kidding, you will most likely be squaring off against other, REAL people in a 4 on 4 match that plays like death match. A score of team kills is kept and in those few hectic minutes you begin to realize the real power of the skill system in the game. My character, a Me/Wa was unbelievably damaging to other spell casters, but got eaten alive by melee types.<br /><br />After this brief and shocking taste of organized PvP you are whisked out of the acadamy on a high priority cooperative assignment (you retain your team from the PvP engagement, so you will be doing this with other players in a forced group). This mission is to kill a named mob deep in some nearby caves, while not wholy challenging the first taste of instanced combined arms play with others is revealing and entertaining. At the close of this mission, some plot unfolds that I won't spoil that will change the game forever, there is no going back as I said.<br /><br />NPC Group members?<br /><br />From this point foward your game changes as well. Adventure areas get tougher, the mobs get smarter and there are more options. In a very nice addition, you can hire NPC group members. So if you don't want to play with friends, or can't find that healer you need, just hire an NPC one. In my brief play, the NPC group members acquited themselves very well. Healer types heal, rangers and casters try to keep their distance, and the fighters do their best to tank. They all auto-assist on you or another group member. Casters will try to remove debuffs on you and debuff mobs, cast buffs as necessary etc. They don't react as fast to the situation as real players would, but, if you're a soloer, they are a sufficient subistitute. The tradeoff is that you get less XP and loot.<br /><br />A new kind of PvP<br /><br />Due to the very nature of the "everything" is instanced in Guild Wars, this gives them tremendous control over the situation. PvP occurs on in PvP areas and is always goal based. Sometimes it's just to kill the other team, but often it is a capture the flag style situation. The is always a plot, or reason behind the situation and always a good reward for winning. There is no penalty for dieing in Guild Wars, other than lost time or a failed mission that needs to be restarted. No XP loss, no item loss, just ego loss <br /><br />As a result, the "pressure" of PvP seems to be on fun and competition, not dominance and ego-tripping. It plays a bit more like a quake match in that regard. Bragging rights all around.<br /><br />Progression and the "End Game"<br /><br />My brief forray has only scratched the surface. I'm level 8, there is a level cap at 20. The game is all about "the end game". Getting to level 20 is really just the start of the game, a trainining run. From what I can see the focus of the game will be on equipment hunting and skill gathering. Nearly all of your skills will come as quest rewards, many of which can only be obtained on the most difficult adventures, often involving winning at PvP.<br /><br />ArenaNet promisses a slew of new content, which you will have to pay for, on a regular basis. There is no monthly fee, so their plan for revenue generation is to throw "must have" content at you that you need to pay for. While the frequency and cost haven't been communicated clearly imagine that it will amount to about $10 a month on average <br /><br />Graphics and Sound<br /><br />Somewhere between WoW and EQ2 lies Guild Wars. I'd argue that Guild Wars has the ability to be far more breathtaking than EQ2 while retaining that artistic flair the WoW has achieved. Guild Wars runs on respectable machines without all the frame stuttering nonsense of EQ2. Using superb texturing, unique lighting and great choice of color pallettes ArenaNet achieves an amazingly gorgeous look. The kind that makes people stop and go "That looks incredible." <br /><br />More impressive is they achieve this look while retaining a solid sense of art direction that reminds you this is a "fantasy" world. The character models have a heavy anime influence, especially in the costume design for the caster classes. Though aspects of the models are decidedly more western (faces tend towards realism rather than cartoon). <br /><br />They are somewhat plagued by "sameness" as there is a limited set of looks for each class, often leaving primary classes easily identifiable. There is a dye system in game, though it is exorbatantly expensive to change the color of your clothes and not adviseable early in the game.<br /><br /><br />In Closing<br /><br />I question the longevity of this game design. 20 Levels, mostly PvP or co-op mission content and already hundreds of skills. It will definately be a "fun" game to play but I'm not sure it will foster the same kind of community and spirit that other MMORPG's do around their worlds. But then, I'm not sure it was ever meant to. Guild Wars seems to present an alternative game style, one that focuses on short gaming sessions and player competition in a more friendly controlled atmosphere. Where the pressure is not on how many hours you play, but on your actual skill at playing the game.<br /><br />A refreshing change of pace that shows how innovation is still alive and well. The concept of NPC group members is a stroke of genius, you will never be LFG or looking for a healer again. Their implementation of instanced missions, cooperative and PvP zones is fantastic, showing how much power there is in an instanced solution. Though ultimately it leaves the world feeling a bit more barren and lonely than it needs to. This is a game best appreciated with friends and a guild.<br /></div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">I picked it up just because there's no monthly fee.  I played my character to lvl 6 on the first night.  I created a male Elementalist.  I was playing around with the emotes and so I did a /dance.  He starts out kind of dorky but then gets into it and at the end he starts doing the "Elaine" from Seinfeld. I almost pee'd myself laughing when I saw that!  :giggle:   I also discovered some that weren't listed in the manual: /guitar, /violin, /drum which were almost as amusing.
<br />
<br />The graphics are gorgeous.  Some have said the movement is Diablo-esque and it is in that you can click somewhere ahead of you and your character will move there.  I tend to just move around in 3rd person with the keyboard and mouse a la EQ2.  
<br />
<br />To me it's the combat that's more diablo-ish though it's not as fast.  You can't hack through a swarm of 50 mobs but it's the same idea.  They say this game will be based on skill not how uber your character is, but it seems to me that there isn't much skill involved at all.  There isn't much mobility so if a mob is shooting magic missiles at you it's hard to avoid for example.  It seems the best strategy is to just go head to head with the mob until one of you dies.  The only skill involved is knowing what your spells/skills do.
<br />
<br />Even so it's a fun diversion once in awhile.  I enjoyed Diablo/Diablo II as much as the next guy so even if it is reminiscent of it that's fine.  The quests are OK and it's a beautiful environment to roam around in.</div>

			<div class="content">I haven't come across that type of behavior, but I've mostly only been in the beginning areas, which are primarily instanced content. 
<br />
<br />I will say that I find the "community" in Guild Wars to be lacking, even moreso than in WoW - and I'm not fond of the WoW community.  GW seems to be built on the premise of skilled, mature players...but it has attracted many of the worse kind of Quake/CS elements.  Like I said, haven't come across anything as bad as you indicated, but I wouldn't be shocked if I do in the future. A few phenominal players; a lot of really immature ones.</div>

			<div class="content">I'm level 20 now 
<br />
<br />I agree the game has more immature players than other rpg games
<br />
<br />but that doesnt mean they outnumber the mature players
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />one nice thing about GuildWars,
<br />it has the most immersive storyline that Ive yet seen from any existing RPG online game
<br />
<br />you really feel like your character is part of world events when you do missions (postsearing)</div>

			<div class="content">There is only one server in guild wars.  (Amazing, but true.)  Similar to City of Heroes, the game instead relies on real instances and instancing public areas.  Any heavily trafficed area (like Aschelon, for instance) will start spinning off separate instances when the population demands it.  You can just check with your friends, see what version of the area they are in (like District 3), and then in the upper left corner you can change which instanced version you are in.  Interesting concept and a way to make sure that you never have to worry about being on the wrong server from friends you have now or ones you'll make years to come. 
<br />
<br />Not surprisingly, as a result the naming system requires at least 2 names, with a max of 20 characters per name.  My characters are:

<br />Echo Eternal, Elem/Monk

<br />
<br />Wow, with two names from creation, the variations on "Legolas," "Aragorn," and "Raistlin" will be virtually unlimited.
<br />
<br />But seriously, this game is looking nice.  My real weakness if character creation and customization (appearance but more importantly, skills and attributes), and the major/minor class thing and character appearances from screenshots just make me salivate.</div>

			<div class="content">Well, I picked it up because one of the RL friends I try to play EQ with wanted to give it a try.  From what he was saying, and the fact it was only a one time fee, I went and got it myself.
<br />
<br />The graphics are VERY nice. =D&gt; 
<br />
<br />The invisible walls are VERY annoying. #-o 
<br />
<br />The game does seem a bit hollow because it doesn't seem alive with a community.  Of course that's also one of the big lures, no camping or issues dealing with idiots and mental toddlers.
<br />
<br />You quickly find that experience comes primarily from quests, because exp from killing spawns is fairly weak compared to the quest rewards.  And you get abilitys or better weapons at the same time from a quest so . . . You quest. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":)" title="icon_biggrin.gif" />  Well at least I do.
<br />
<br />For a world that looks as large as they may have made it, it seems to have less depth than EQ.  I really have a hard time saying why I feel this, but it may be because no one is there along with you unless you group up.  In the end you feel like there is a wildy large script you are supposed to follow, although they allow you to get through each section on your own time.
<br />
<br />Granted I have yet to really get into the game, but there is certainly not a great deal of emphasis on gear.  At lvl 6 on my Elementalist/Necro I have yet to purchase any gear except for two bags and bank space. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":)" title="icon_biggrin.gif" />  Some of them look really good to me, but theres not a lot of items, and not a huge difference in quality, so your skill at knowing what to mix and match skill wise is where you truly shine.  And that means how well you PLAY is all that matters. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":)" title="icon_biggrin.gif" />
<br />
<br />Most encounters are set so you don't pull singles, although maybe you can pacify as a skill at some point.  Pull one, and no matter how far away the other members of teh "group" are they all come running.  When alone pulling that single hulking stone mob seems a great idea, until you see three others well outside the 'agro' circle come running in. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":)" title="icon_biggrin.gif" />
<br />
<br />In a few days though I have had fun, but I wonder how long it will last for me.  I do find myself playing quite a bit, and have ignored EQ for the past week or so.  But I do find myself thinking about my EQ characters on occasion.  On the other hand I was able to get my own name there as a Mesmer class.  But I have not picked a secondary class.  So far I played Teegun because she grouped up (at lvl 3) with my RL friend (Ranger and Mesmer lvl 9) for the wall quest.
<br />
<br /> :roll: Little did I know what was coming.  #-o</div>

<br />what you have to watch out for, as you fight, is that you dont aggro other patrolling monsters

<br />-- or you may be fighting as many as 5 to 7 at once  :twisted:

			<div class="content">for new people to the game
<br />
<br />the game changes dramatically after you leave the newbie lands (presearing)
<br />
<br />you can leave the newbie lands as early as level 2 but ideally you want to be level 6+
<br />
<br />
<br />PreSearing
<br />- there are no missions, only quests
<br />- there are no hirelings, only an annoying kid npc named Gwen
<br />
<br />
<br />PostSearing
<br />- there are missions, where your character is part of the main story
<br />- there are hirelings, you can solo with 3+ npcs if you want
<br />- its tougher  :twisted:</div>

			<div class="content">A <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/" class="postlink">Penny Arcade</a> review describes the huge difference between pre and post-searing game play:
<br />
<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Alright, I know enough about Guild Wars to discuss it now. <br /><br />Something I cannot stress enough is that you can play it for a very long time, very long, without actually arriving at the real game. Because there is nothing to distinguish the "training period" from the "real deal," you will - as I did - form opinions about Guild Wars that don't have any bearing on the actual flow of play. <br /><br />I suppose even that admission is a spoiler of sorts, but I'm mentioning it because before the switch I referred to I really wasn't feeling it. It's my opinion that the starting areas aren't anywhere near as fun as where you end up - they aren't challenging, the "lewt" is below par, and I wasn't terribly engaged by the setting. I'd imagine there are people who, imagining sixty or seventy hours of that stretching out before them, might decide that there were (perhaps) more judicious time investments. Perhaps those people are named Gabriel, though they might not have used the word "judicious" when they described their experience to me. It's simply a fact that I am willing to work at a game in the hopes of an eventual payout, let me direct you to my PC heritage, and there's a very good discussion to have about whether or not there should be a toil element in our electronic diversions. We'll talk about it on AIM! }:o) <br /><br />I was shocked to see Gamespot's 9.2 review of the game, though it seems like they're just handing that shit out these days. The reality, however, is that if the smoking hot Greg Kasavin played it with some guys from the office, earning levels and abilities, eventually culminating in some kind of epic player versus player matchup, the score just isn't that surprising. Once you get off the bunny hill and mount the shuddering chairlift to Death Mountain, you start to understand what they're getting at. <br /><br />Combat is extremely fast-paced in Guild Wars. A ten second buff lasts an eternity. Things go to hell quickly. They can be redeemed just as fast. So if you've heard the words MMO and Guild Wars together, it creates a kind of mental template which you imagine will define certain elements of the experience, and then a warrior caves in your skull with a maul. The immediacy of it is intense and strangely addictive. I'm curious to see how long I will maintain this level of enthusiasm. My guess is shortly after the banners come down. <br /></div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">I'm having a great time in Guild Wars.  Love the fact I can solo a little more with my Mes/Mo char and its much more quest based.  My friend who has a Nec/Mo and I group all the time and seem to do just fine with the quests but a third person makes it a little easier.  Interesting game though, can't wait to get even higher up and the fact it doesn't cost monthly (yet) makes it a whole lot better &gt;&lt;.</div>

You will have access to many more strategic options, due to the expanding nature of the skills, abilities, items and professions that you enjoy with each chapter. <br /><br />It would be similar to building a deck in Magic: The Gathering™: The more cards you own, the more different playing decks that you can choose from to use in the game. <br /><br />When you buy the chapters of Guild Wars, you will acquire a larger collection of skills and abilities from which to build your skill set, but you will not gain more power. So if you purchase a chapter and your friend does not, you will still be able to play competitively against and with one another.</div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">I'm curious how they intend to stay profitable without charging a subscription.  My guess is probably that they are relying on people continuing to purchase expansions.  Also, perhaps their structure of instancing missions and invisible walls makes for less server overhead (I'm not a server techie type - just a guess).
<br />
<br />One thing about the invisible walls in the zones - while it can be a bit annoying for sure, I think it also is what allows these absolutely gorgeous zones to exist and run so smoothly.  The game loads up incredibly fast and zoning is so quick it's not a bother at all.  Overall, I think the tradeoff is worth it so far.
<br />
<br />I bought it this weekend.  The Electronic Boutiques guy said that seems to be "the game" people are buying right now.
<br />
<br />I'm still in the newbie area.  I can't stop myself from rerolling and trying on different hats.  My necro/warrior is a death machine so far, and my monk/elementalist is doing fine.  Maybe I'll take these two outside this weekend and see how they do.  I have a ranger/mesmer who seems promising as well.  Number four is still open, though I like the mesmer character model, so it'll probably be based off of that (gotta like looking at your toon).
<br />
<br />In terms of depth of character development, looking at the options down the road, I could probably build four characters with the exact same primary and secondary professions, and create four characters with completely different play styles.
<br />
<br />Speaking of character models, here is the reason that Guild Wars is the best fantasy genre online game ever:
<br />
<br />NO CASTERS IN ROBES!!!  YOU HEARD IT!!!  NO DRAG QUEEN WIZARDS!!!  WOOHOO!!!
<br />
<br />Mesmers start in this cool green and white outfit that's very costume-ball in appearance (the mask they start with adds to this for sure).  Men and women in pants.  A mesmer/warrior really looks like a great swashbuckler.
<br />
<br />Necros have some goth/bondage thing going on, and look quite menacing.
<br />
<br />Elementalists seem ready for a night on the town.  Males in dark leather pants and jackets, and females in skirts with some gravity-defying top.
<br />
<br />Monks (a healer/priest type - not a martial artist) look like chic runway models in a Hari Krishna-inspired fashion show.
<br />
<br />Each primary profession (primary profession determines the model) has its own body type, face, and hair options.</div>

			<div class="content">Sai, why don't you try taking the game back to the store and getting a return.  They don't offer money-back but they should offer exchange for the same game.  You could show them the account key and tell them that you cannot make it out and it does not work with the guesses you try.
<br />
<br />As to the game, I've been doing the same thing as brakeformez - making different characters in the newbie area over and over.  I can't decide which combinations I like the best.  On Friday I decided that was because I couldn't really tell how they'd operate in PvP or high end content.
<br />
<br />So this weekend I made some PVP characters to try it out.  VERY FUN!  Also VERY FRUSTRATING!  I stress that this is NOT the real game.  This is NOT all that is left to you when make level 20 in the game and PVP.  When you make a PVP character you are limited to some pre-made combinations.  You can choose for your PVP character any spells/armor/runes that your RP characters have earned, though.  ONce created you enter the PVP waiting area.  Here you click "Begin Mission" in your group box and the game will port you into the arena with three other characters in your group.  You'll have about 10 seconds to plan before the doors open and the arena showdown begins against the opposing group.  If you win, your group will continue with matches against others.  If you lose, you head back to the waiting area to join another group. 
<br />
<br />The groups have a wide range of skill.  Some are absolutely awful and you will be terribly frustrated and annoyed.  To add to that, you do have to deal with the leet speak names and sometimes some miserly chat.   There is very little cohesiveness to that first group and when someone dies they may just decide to quit the group rather than wait for a rez, for instance.  Once you've won a few with the same group you typically start forming a simple group bond.  
<br />
<br />Other groups are fantastic.  In large part this depends on the makeup the computer gave you.  The computer does NOT ensure a healer and tank for each group.  I've now done numerous groups w/o a tank or a healer and numerous groups where I was one of four healers (we were a bad ass group actually).  The best run I had was last night for about three hours.  We had two healers, of which I was one, and a really good warrior/monk (paladin).  The other healer was not a true healing prayers healer, so he always went in first to draw their attention.  I'd land a healing seed on him from behind the wall where they couldn't view me (which, when he was hit, heals himself and all other party members for a set amount), and we'd go to town. 
<br />
<br />I decided I liked monk/elementalist (despite everyone telling me it was a horrid, horrid choice because one ought to simply be a support healer or a DPS machine - not both).  In PVP the other team almost always goes for the monk healer first.  But with my elementalist AEs, I would wait until they pounded on me, hit a heal over time, and then proceed to AE nuke their asses while I healed myself.  Personally, I loved the tactic. 
<br />
<br />I also made a necro/mesmer, which are just death on wheels and extremely difficult to survive against in PVP I've learned.  The single best PVP player I saw in my weekend travels was a Necromancer who, after I and the rest of my group had died, literally solo'd the other group for a win. 
<br />
<br />Anyway, for those of you who aren't sure what you want to be when you grow up *grin* I suggest making a PVP character and trying some things out.   Not only can you find what YOU enjoy doing, but you can check out other styles of play and other combinations to see what is most efficient and effective.</div>
