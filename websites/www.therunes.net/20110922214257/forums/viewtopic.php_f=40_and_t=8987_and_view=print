				<div class="content">I'd like to do the interview a bit differently. Unmei's graciously agreed to allow all of you to submit the questions. 
<br />
<br />You can either PM me with the question(s) you'd like to ask, e-mail it to me, or post here.  I'll end the week by asking him any questions submitted directly to me.
<br />
<br />So here's your chance to get to know our latest (and hopefully last) SOE Enchanter Correspondent.
<br />
<br />Have fun and get creative <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":)" title="icon_biggrin.gif" /></div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Cerpicio wrote:</cite>What's your favorite race?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Humans, actually. I find it hard to break out of the stereotypes of the other races without seeming like I'm deliberately breaking out of the stereotype.    If that doesn't make much sense, just imagine how many "good" dark elves there are out there.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>What's your favorite illusion?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Minor Illusion.  It's just fun to turn into random stuff.   OR uh... Illusion Vah Shir. Projected only. ;)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Most prized possesion?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Tough one.  I don't tend to get that attached to specific items of gear, but I -do- still have my Rod of Insidious Glamour in the bank...<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Favorite zone?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I suck at favorites, but this is probably a tossup between Kedge Keep, Plane of Water, and the Accursed Temple of Cazic Thule.   All three of which are places I spent a lot of time with friends at one point or another.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Least favorite zone?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Plane of Earth? Or maybe RSS.  Boring zones are what gets me most.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Favorite quest?</div></blockquote><br /><br />The Burning Rapier.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>What other classes have you played, and how high did you get them?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I have a rogue at 70, a shaman at 54, a ranger at..uh...25, I think, and a smattering of other junk at 20 or lower (Bard, Necro, Mage, stuff.)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>What made you want to start an enchanter?</div></blockquote><br /><br />My original main when I first started playing was a rogue (the one who's now level 70 with a ton less AAs than Unmei).  I had a couple of RL friends who were starting the game, way back around Kunark release, and I knew, from my playing on my rogue, that what a warrior and a cleric needed was an enchanter.  And boy they could do cool stuff.  I remember seeing enchanters mezzing trash in Unrest and one who charmed a goblin in Permafrost during a touch and go king room break, and I was sold.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Are you into trade skills?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Not really, which is a strange thing to say when I have Jewelcraft at 296, Pottery at 240something, Research at like 235 and 300 Poison Making on my rogue.  I just want to make sure my friends have access to someone who can do this stuff.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Do you have all your languages maxed?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Not even close.  Though I do have Orc maxxed from doing the alternate Access: Torment quest way back when.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>How many different guilds have you been in?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Unmei is on his third guild now.  Come to think of it, so is Shadey (the rogue in question), but his first two weren't the same as Unmei's first two.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Do you play on Lanys (Seventh Hammer)?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes actually.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If so, do you have any platinum you'd like to share with me?</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />That depends on terms of the loan.</div>

<br />
<br />Truthfully, Unmei and I had a very long PM conversation that lasted about 2 months over mostly anime.  Mostly over Evangelion, and I we got on the subject of how we started, so I already asked him all these questions.
<br />
<br />I've got it....

<br />Wasnt Evangelion like the COOLEST thing you've ever seen? toothy10.gif

<br />
<br />The number of zones that I've never visited is actually really small at this point.  I think (though I may be missing one or two) that it consists solely of:
<br />
<br />Vex Thal
<br />Anguish
<br />Demiplane
<br />Dreadspire (Keyed but haven't actually -gone- there yet.)
<br />and uh...Forgotten Halls (That strange instanced zoned they added a while back that I don't actually know how to get to.)
<br />
<br />I figure I'll see demiplane and anguish eventually, so that pretty much leaves VT;  I'd like to see it, but I'm never gonna do that stupid key. =/</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Luminious wrote:</cite>Where did you get the name for your character?</div></blockquote><br /><br />This is one my favorite little stories, and I do mean 'little'.  Unmei is named what he is because the name filter shot down my first two choices.  I'd been watching a lot of Vision of Escaflowne (Which is a damn fine anime, and I would recommend it to just about anyone).  I always watch my anime subtitled, because I like the japanese voices, and "unmei" is japanese for "fate" or "destiny" - a concept that gets thrown around a -lot- in that show.  So the word was on the brain, I was annoyed with the name filter, and presto! <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>How do you say it?</div></blockquote><br /><br />phonetically, it's "oon-may" (Edited: I always have trouble with emphasis, so I can't honestly say which syllable it's supposed to be on. May well be the first.  If you don't place any emphasis on either syllable, you won't be far off.)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Whats /played tell you?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Some gruesome large number.  I used Unmei as my bazaar trader for quite a while, so he's got a lot of time logged standing in one spot while I slept.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Whats your favorite color?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Green.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If you were stranded on an island with only a roll of duct tape, a snorkel and a pair of tweezers what would you do?</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />Barter them for a bus fare to somewhere with a phone.  Oh, you meant a DESERTED island?</div>
