You never know what laughs and pranks are to be found, during this enjoyable time of year. Celebrators are present in every home city, and the oddest of objects have been spotted in Antonica, The Commonlands, Darklight Wood, Timorous Deep and Greater Faydark! Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for special events occurring only on the highest of silly days, 4/1/2009!<br /><br />Lavastorm<br />Lots of brand new content has been added in this classic zone. Almost all of the population has been re-tiered for solo players, with a new level 45 to 55 adventure quest line with the industrious…but rather insane Sootfoot goblins, and a new level 40-45 tradeskill quest line. Brand new void invaded areas also feature new level 80 solo quests. Additionally, a solo-able daily shard quest has been added as well as mount paths and additional teleporters to make traversing the zone much easier!<br /><br />Shard Armor<br />A new set of shard armor is now available from merchants!<br /><br />Threat Meter<br />Players can now see how much aggro they have generated towards NPC’s in combat.<br />A new UI element will display players’ aggro percentage for their current target or implied target.<br />Players with the most hate will also see the hate value for the player below them.<br />Players’ aggro value will also appear above an NPC’s head, just below their remaining power.<br />The aggro value displayed above an NPC’s head may be toggled off under Options -&gt; User Interface -&gt; Name and Chat Bubble<br /><br />Ward of Elements<br />A brand new level 80 two-group raid instance has been added! This zone is balanced for players without a proliferation of raid gear, and should provide an exciting challenge to any group of 12! The first six bosses can be tackled in any order, and provide fantastic fabled loot with brand new armor sets upgraded from the tier 2 void shard sets, complete with new appearances! You can find it in Lavastorm beneath the Hollow Tower and Deep Forge.<br /><br />ACHIEVEMENTS<br />Cleric<br />Sacrifice is now instant cast and recovery but will no longer be absorbed by wards.<br />Allied Prayers will trigger properly if the Cleric is casting.<br /><br />ATREBE’S LABORATORY<br />Many NPC spells within Atrebe’s Laboratory: The Fabled City of Kor-sha will no longer target other NPCs.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY<br />Xebnok and other charming mobs should no longer cause clients to crash.<br />Picking character advancement and training spells (i.e. Master II spells) will now attempt to add the spells to your hotbar and indicate where they are with spinning arrows.<br />Group members can now use the /invite command to request that the group leader invite a player to the group.

No warranty applies, use at own risk, no refunds, gnomeland security accepts no liability for injuries or loss incurred due to malfunction or spontaneous combustion.<br />A void shard now drops from the final boss of Obelisk of Ahkzul, two from the final boss of the Anchor of Bazzul, and three are present within the Palace of Ferzhul!<br /><br />GUILD HALLS<br />The guild hall mender will now correctly remember the new coverage setting after it is changed.<br />Paying upkeep on a house or guild hall now requires confirmation.<br />The “Call to Guild Hall” spell to has been modified to have less of an impact on server performance when many players use it at once.<br />Amenities will now move with players when moving to a new guild hall.<br />Any amenities that are not allowed in the new guild hall will continue to be refunded to players’ escrow accounts. If the move results in having more amenities than allowed, players will not be able to move items until some amenities are removed.<br />Permissions for the Harvest Supply Depot amenity have been changed as follows:<br />- Any player with access to the guild hall may deposit items into the depot.<br />- Only players with Trustee access to the hall may withdraw items directly from the depot.<br />- The ability to craft using items in the depot is defined using the permission level on the amenity tab.<br /><br />ITEMS<br />Forgotten Ring of Souls had a higher bonus on it than was intended.
