			<div class="content">I just finished getting the fastest XP that I have ever gotten on any character I've ever had <span style="font-weight: bold">at any level</span>.   "How?", you might ask.  Let me tell you.
<br />
<br />Now, if you're on this site, chances are that you've probably read about the rockhopper caves in DSP, and how great they are to Charm solo through your 40's.  They are great.  Too great.  
<br />
<br />You see, not only are 40ish Chanters able to solo here, but so is just about any other 60's character class.   The rockhopper hides sell for an insane amount of cash in the bazaar.  Since this is the best place in EQ to farm them, these caves are rarely ever open for us to XP at.  It was this problem that led me to discover even better xp.
<br />
<br />*This first part is just as if you were going to hunt at the caves with your charmed pet.  I got this information from the guide on this site, so I'm not trying to take credit for it.  Here's a rundown if you haven't read it yet:*
<br />
<br />It's very important that you get a blue ceramic band.  You can buy them in the bazaar typically for under 50 pp.  I think I got mine for 25 pp or so.  This band is important, since if you don't do any damage to the mobs, you won't get any xp (or a share not worth mentioning anyway).  This band casts a 5 damage spell, which is all you need to get your fair share of xp on the mobs.  It's also important for you to get sow potions (at level 44, you can just use the scaled wolf illusion for enhanced run speed).  You're probably thinking that you don't want to spend the money on a sow potion.  Well, do it.  It's more than worth it.  I guarantee that you'll think so, too.
<br />
<br />You should start this method at level 39, since this is when we get the charm spell Cajoling Whispers.  Go to the camp left of the rockhopper caves in DSP.  Lull all the mobs around the campfire and tash the guy standing by the flag.  As he runs, make sure no other mobs stand up and follow him.  If others follow him, head to the Neth zoneline.  Make sure that you let them get fairly close to you before zoning.  This way, you'll be able to get to one of them before they get back to camp, since they typically separate when you zone.  If he comes alone from the first cast, you're golden.  Regardless, as soon as you get him single, mez him, charm him, give him 2 weapons, and cast your fastest haste spell on him.  You now have a tank that will kill faster than you can find mobs (literally).
<br />
<br />*Here's where I deviate from the already mentioned strategy.*
<br />
<br />Now that you've got your click casting item and your nuclear missile of a pet, it's time to start the XP gushing in.  I know what you're thinking.  No, don't mess with the rockhoppers yet...even if the camp is open.  What you're hunting for are wolves and zelinaks (both the large and regular varieties).  These can be found all over the zone in plentiful amounts. 
<br />
<br />You see, as good as rockhoppers are, it takes a lot of time to run in and pull them to your parked pet.  It's also very dangerous running too far into the cave, so the number that you're pulling is limited.  If your charm breaks while you're deep in the cave, expect to get hurt...badly.  Hunting the wolves and zelinaks, your targets are limitless.  You just pull with your blue ceramic band and run them to your following pet.  
<br />
<br />I was getting probably 2 to 3 kills on average per minute (not counting the charm breaks).  I was killing things so quickly that I had between 15 and 20 corpses on the ground at almost all times.  With 1 percent xp per kill, you add up the speed that xp flows in.  You'll be killing quicker than you did even at level 1!!  It is this good.
<br />
<br />I was to a point where I would pull even when my pet was fighting a mob.  I usually had one lined up rooted and ready to attack next while he was getting the killing blow on the first one.  The great thing is that you just go all over the zone, there's no camp to compete for at all.
<br />
<br />Another benefit of this is that it allows you to slowly understand and master the techniques of charm fighting.  The land is quite open, so if charm breaks, you can run away, mez, rinse and repeat.  I know that I feel a lot more comfortable now using charm than I did when I first began at level 39.  
<br />
<br />Anyway, I hope this helps some of you out there.

			<div class="content">Yeah those NPCs in DSP are just plain fun. You get a taste of just how powerful charm can be at 39. FYI for others reading who are not familiar - these NPCs are lvl 45 so they are red. However they are not incredibly resistant and you can still charm them somewhat reliably. 
<br />
<br />There is also an NPC camp quite close to the NL zoneline. The gnome inside the tent can easily be single pulled without Pacify or anything. Give him a couple weapons and he'll quad for 178 and has a TON of HP like the rest of em. I did 39 to 41 here and then I actually went back to the basilisks in Surefall till 43.
<br />
<br />The hopper caves are camped 24/7 on my server, and even so the idea of a 60% hasted whacko that wants my head coming after me in the caves just doesn't appeal to me hehe. I'm currently in the Dreadlands and find that the drolvarg ragers make good pets. I can usually get 6 to 8 kills before I have to put my pet down. XP is still pretty good. I get 20% about every 30 to 40 minutes. As an aside for anyone thinking about going the Dreadlands route, don't bother charming the ravishing drolvargs. Yeah they have a ton of HP and hit for 110ish, but they break charm way too often to make it worth it.
<br />
<br />I'm currently lvl 47 with 3 days and 11 hours /played. I &lt;3 Charm  :lol:

			<div class="content">Just kind of an addendum to my last post...
<br />
<br />After posting I went and gave the ravishings another go. Last time I tried to use one I think was 43 or 44. At 47 they were much easier to control. I was also able to kill roughly 2 or 3 times as many mobs before I had to burn down the pet. I got about 45% in a tad over an hour using 2 ragers and 2 ravishings.
