				<div class="content">Hopefully you've used them by now, but how about fried rice?<br /><br />I don't think it needs a recipe really (veggies, shrimp etc., green onions or chives, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, eggs) though I put a bit of sesame oil in, or a few drops on the top when I serve it, and it adds a terrific flavor. Maybe a little bit of fish sauce if you're making shrimp fried rice or something where a seafoodie taste would be good.</div>

				<div class="content">You still have chives left? If so, a dim sum place I discovered serves these chive dumplings that are amazing. Basically steamed dumplings stuffe with chopped shrimp and chives, but lots of and lots of chives.<br /><br />And while I load my potstickers with green onions and pork, chives would work just as well.</div>

				<div class="content">Oregano is my current bane.  I didn't know it was a perennial root spreader that was zone 4 hardy before I put it in my herb bed.  I am going to have to start the whole bed over.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="icon_sad.gif" /><br /><br />I will try the dumplings though.  I always have chives because we use garlic chives as part of our natural pest deterrent and I have some standard ones in a flower bed for decoration.</div>
