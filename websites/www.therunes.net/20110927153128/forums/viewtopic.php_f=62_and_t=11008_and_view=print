				<div class="content">the Witcher to get significant update<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thewitcher.com/community/en/press_releases/219.html">http://www.thewitcher.com/community/en/ ... s/219.html</a><!-- m --><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>&quot;The Witcher: Enhanced Edition<br /><br />Work is being done on two levels. One concerns the removal of technical obstacles that hinder the player from properly using the game and thus gaining enjoyment from it. By that I mean level loading times, which will be reduced by 80%, the stability of the game on different configurations, as well as a whole array of smaller fixes that will increase interactivity and precision in combat. <br /><br />The other level consists of very important changes that are not usually found in patches. <br /><br />First and foremost, the English language version will be, for the most part, completely re-done. The amount of text in that version was reduced compared to other language versions and that was said to cause a significant decrease in immersion and atmosphere. Now the English version will be as polished and atmospheric as the other language versions. <br /><br />Speaking of language versions, most of them will be more or less improved. Significant changes will also be made in the German version, where we are planning to re-record the voices for many of the characters. <br /><br /><br />The most important improvements concern those elements of the game that the players criticized the most. <br /><br />So for example, over 50 new supporting character models will be added, so that the player won't run into the same person too often. The inventory panel will be re-designed and improved, and some elements of the main game screen will be polished. <br /><br />However, one of the biggest changes that will greatly increase the player's immersion in the game world will be improvements concerning dialogue scenes. <br /><br />Both Geralt and the NPCs will get over 100 new animated gestures which will make their &quot;body language&quot; during a conversation much more natural. Additionally, the face animation and lip-sync system will be re-created, making the faces of the speakers now even more natural as well. Of course, I've mentioned only the most important changes, and that's still a lot. There will be many smaller changes that will make the game more fun<br /><br /><br />There's also an included mod editor called D'jinni that allows players to create or modify their own adventures in the world of The Witcher</div></blockquote>.<br /><br />from the email I received<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Aside from the value-packed retail version, <br /><br />the new content and improvements (including a DVD with the D'jinii Mod Editor, as well as two additional adventures) will be available to registered users in the form of a free downloadable update!</div></blockquote><br /><br />some things, like the editor, will be available for download March 14th<br /><br />the rest will be available May 16th when the Enhanced version hits Retail</div>
