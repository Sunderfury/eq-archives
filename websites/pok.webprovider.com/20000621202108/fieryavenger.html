<B>Raain, Kanadar, Bathizarre, and Damali on the rathe ventured to the plane of air. We hailed Dason Goldblade, when we came across this one..dirkog steelhand. He replied to kanadar's question about the burning blade. Interestingly enough, you have to pay him 500 plat to get the second guy to spawn, we couldn't quite figure out what he meant by Up top. Anyways, by our honor to share anything we find...here is the log.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<FONT FACE="TAHOMA" SIZE="2" COLOR="WHITE"> 
He spawns up on the  Fourth Isle(pegasus isle)  when someone turns in the money to Dirkog. Inte spawns  in the windmill.  All will be dubious to him except those who have good faction with the deepwater knights(ie: another Erudite Paladin).<BR><BR>
You can raise your faction with the Deepwater Knights by killing Elial Brook, an approx. level 8 heretic necromancer that spawns at the docks in the Toxxula Forrest.  His timed spawn rate is 6 minutes.<BR><BR><BR>

 Log of Inte Akera's complete conversation:<BR><BR>
[Sun Mar 05 15:43:36 2000] Hottoq says, 'hail Inte Akera'<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 15:43:36 2000] Inte Akera says 'Greetings Hottoq. I am Inte Akera. I have retired to the Plane of Sky after a long life toiling on Norrath's soil. Have you retreated to here as well, or are you merely visiting? <BR>
[Sun Mar 05 15:45:30 2000] Sandriel says, 'what toil'<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 15:45:30 2000] Inte Akera says 'Long ago, before I came to this plane, I fought in the name of Prexus against all the evils that plagued Norrath. In that time, I have done everything one can do. I have fought for the causes of good. I claimed esteem from kings and lords. The sword I hold is but one example of the treasures I have quested for and won. I have accomplished all that I can, have all that I desire. My toil is done and now I sit among the clouds in peace, occasionally blessing those that seek it and are found worthy.<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 15:48:49 2000] Sandriel says, 'I seek your blessing'<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 15:48:49 2000] Inte Akera says 'Many come seeking my blessings, no matter how minor they be. They all must prove that they embody the qualities of a paladin before I bless them. <BR>
[Sun Mar 05 15:48:59 2000] Sandriel says,'How may I prove myself'<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 15:48:59 2000] Inte Akera says 'I believe the two most important qualities of a paladin are nobility and sacrifice. Hand me an item of yours that proves you understand what nobility and sacrifice are. Be warned however, if I do not think as you do, I will simply accept the item as a gift, and give you no blessing. <BR>
***SoulFire is given to Inte Akera***<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 16:05:48 2000] Inte Akera says 'You have chosen wisely my friend. Take this note as a token of my blessing upon you. <BR>
[Sun Mar 05 16:05:48 2000] You gain party experience!!<BR>
***The Note Inte hands back reads***<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 16:43:37 2000] Sandriel says, 'You have shown yourself as one that follows the path of nobility like no other.'<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 16:08:58 2000] Sandriel says,'some quests you just need the items and not the faction.. just need to know what the items are'<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 16:08:58 2000] Inte Akera says 'No.. I was unable to kill my most hated foe, Miragul. The head of this wretched, foul necromancer is forever out of the reach of justice. It would be worth restoring him to his former state for the chance to take his head as a trophy.<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 16:24:34 2000] Sandriel says,'why were you unable to kill miragul'<BR>
[Sun Mar 05 16:24:34 2000] Inte Akera says 'You think you can succeed where I cannot? Perhaps you can noble one.. Bring me the head of Miragul, his robe and hand me back the two blessings I gave you, and in return I shall bequeth to you this sword I carry. Good luck my friend.<BR>
 <BR><BR>
What it boils down to is this:<BR><BR>

Inte will tell you that he needs four things and upon you handing them to him he will give you the blade he wields.
These four things are two blessings, the head of Miragul and the Robe of Miragul.
The blessings are received from Inte when you give him items that prove a)your nobility and b) your sacrifice.<BR><BR>

The first blessing, nobility, is received from giving him a Soulfire. <BR><BR>

The second blessing, sacrifice, is recieved from giving him a Ghoulbane. <BR><BR>

The head of Miragul can be found by killing the Lich of Miragul in Everfrost.<BR><BR>

The challenge to obtain the final component, the Robe of Miragul, is where things get interesting. Indeed it seems it will be necessary to bring back Miragul from the dead (or undead as the case may be) and defeat him to obtain his robe. But how to do this? Well, it seems the two book parts dropped from the dragons can be combined to form the book of scale. The book of scale can then be given to the Oracle in OOT who will then present you with a most interesting item. No, it's not the robe itself but it seems instead a key component to getting Miragul reincarnated. How to actually do this though I have no idea.<BR><BR><BR>

History:<BR><BR>
"...Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies to make a portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the while of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid his remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends called a lich.  In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining all the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage’s soul, now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire to amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human traits, and Miragul’s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with artifacts of power."<BR><BR><BR>
Facts:<BR><BR>
He is a necro skeleton mob in the caves in Everfrost(The ones you need to swim to get to)
He is not hard for a 40+ group of 6. Was blue to me at level 49. He often wanders and tends to stay close to the entrance to the caves near the water. He drops his head when killed. I would assume that his spawn time is about 4-5 hours like most all other quest mobs but this is not confirmed.

<B>Information about the Book of Scale as related to  Miragul:</B>
</FONT>
<BR><BR>
<FONT FACE="TAHOMA" SIZE="2" COLOR="WHITE">
"We combined the books and gave the "Book of Scale" to the Oracle, who then tells you something about ressurecting yourself will lead to total chaos in Norrath (whats wierd is he refers to you and not Miragul). What he gives you is in fact "Miragul's Phylactery". The item is no drop so whoever turns in the book must be able to do the next part of the quest. The person who completed it on our server was an SK. I, like you guys, figured the first thing to do with the item would be to give it to Miragul, the problem is he is KOS to everyone. Some things I would like to try are to see if a necro in their skeleton form is KOS, also the item has a blank effect on it. My guess is that this time its not a mistake on the item unlike many other new items in the game. I think you click on miragul and then activate the item with a right click. This is just a guess though, and I look forward to seeing what other people try."<BR><BR>-Felwyn Arkenlight
<BR><BR>
Oracle of Ak'anon text:<BR><BR>
Oracle of K'Arnon says 'Unbelievable! The legendary book of scale is mine! Please, take this as a small token of my thanks. I warn you however, if you ever manage to join the corporeal body to the evil that resides within, you will rue the day.<BR>
Your faction standing with OracleOfKarnon got better<BR>
Your faction standing with OracleOfMarud got worse<BR><BR>
Here are some definitions of a phylactery submitted by Beldukil Lawbringer of the Povar Server.  Definition #3 seems to fit in the case of Miragul.<BR><BR>
phylactery \Phy*lac"ter*y\, n.; pl. Phylacteries. [OE. filateri, OF. filatire, filatiere, F. phylact[`e]re, L. phylacterium, Gr. ?, fr. ? a watcher, guard, ? to watch, guard. Cf. Philatory.]<BR>
 1. Any charm or amulet worn as a preservative from danger or disease.<BR>
2. A small square box, made either of parchment or of black calfskin, containing slips of parchment or vellum on which are written the scriptural passages Exodus xiii. 2-10, and 11-17, Deut. vi. 4-9, 13-22. They are worn by Jews on the head and left arm, on week-day mornings, during the time of prayer. --Schaff-Herzog Encyc.<BR>
3. Among the primitive Christians, a case in which the relics of the dead were inclosed.

<B>A speculation about liches:</B>
</FONT>
<BR><BR>
<FONT FACE="TAHOMA" SIZE="2" COLOR="WHITE">
concerning liches...you can kill a lich as much as you like but it is never truly destroyed until you destroy their "soul jar"...basically a high level necro discorporates their soul and stores it in a holding device, most often referred to as a jar, that way if their body gets destroyed, they still have their soul and can then inhabit another body, then discorporate again, etc<BR><BR>

now the plane NPC says he was never able to defeat miragul, and would love his head as a trophy...ok fine, done deal go kill the lich and get a head<BR><BR>

suppose for the other part (robe i think?) you have to *truly* destroy miragul, which means destroying his soul....so how exactly does one do this? just drop the "jar" and break it and poof he's dead? probably not...i can just see having to find some special NPC who knows how to destroy the soul of a lich (for 2000pp of course) and then rewards you with the robe or something....just a thought but sort of makes sense a bit...of course, maybe giving miragul his soul would corporate <BR><BR><BR>

<B>Speculation about the next steps:</B>
</FONT>
<BR><BR>
<FONT FACE="TAHOMA" SIZE="2" COLOR="WHITE">
"I think you might have to give the Phylactery to Akera to get him to spawn the Lich of Miragul, whom you then kill on the 4th island in the plane of sky to get the robe" - Yukitaro Antslayer, KEG GM, The Rathe<BR><BR>
"There are NPCs in Paineel who respond to questions about Miragul. Actually they refer to him as Myragul. Also, there is a "tormented soul" there that will not respond to my erudite shadowknight.  One NPC who responded to questions about Myragul also responded to a question about the Oracle of Marud." - Avarus, LoD, Innoruuk Server<BR><BR>
"The tortured soul is currently the front runner for the Myragul Robe quest. Now all we need is for an evil acolyte to take Myragul's Phylactery to the tortured soul and then bring 20 or so friends and be prepared for a decent fight." - Drool Darklighter
