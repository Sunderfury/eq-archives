        <p align="center"><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">Greetings Brothers and
        Sisters In Arms,</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">I am writing this letter to you in the
        hope that the role of the Paladin in Norrath is laid out to you in
        greater detail so that you may understand our ways.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">I have been a Paladin for a great number
        of years now and feel that some may have lost the Way.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">One must understand the role a Paladin
        plays and the Beliefs They possess when presented with a problem or foe
        They must defeat. Ours is not an easy task. We bring Justice and Honour
        to our foes with blade and hammer. The use of ranged weapons or spells
        cast from a distance is an insult to Our Abilities and Our Testament to
        the Destruction of Evil in Norrath. Our Skills are granted to Us by the
        Righteousness of our Task and the Deity that grants us that Right. As
        you look upon a battle and watch the Wizards spurt fire from their
        fingers, and the Warriors loose their arrows, know that, while they are
        important elements of Our Battles, We carry the day by destroying the
        Evil with our own hands.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">We do not fight with two blades. This
        would lessen the Power of Our Truthfulness. Every time we strike with
        Our blade, We are Cleansing the Land. To fight with two blades would
        lessen our Resolve. Our Holy Brothers, Clerics, refuse to use blades,
        rather fighting with blunted weapons, to lessen damage and live to their
        vow of refusing to draw blood. We too, fight with blunted weapons, but,
        on the whole, prefer to deal damage with Our Blades as the drawing of
        blood ensures Our Evil Foes Destruction.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">Remember friends, Paladins have existed
        throughout the Ages. As we arrived in Norrath, We did not expect to
        change Our Ways, nor should We.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">We must not be proud, nor be humble.
        Pride is a weakness, causing many to die needlessly, many to falter.
        Humility would lessen Our Resolve, for it takes away Our Confidence. We
        must not Judge. Evil will always present itself, do not look for it, for
        it will find you. When Evil has presented itself, slay it and Cleanse
        the Land! Remember, the Heart contains a Creatures Evil. Although a
        Creature may appear Evil on the outside, look for it Truthfully from the
        Heart.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">Through our Service and Truthfulness,
        the Gods have granted us the use of Spells and Healing. To cast
        offensively would not be part of Our True Being. When We are faced with
        Undead, they Cringe at Our Holiness and Fear our Wrath. We rid the Land
        of Undead through the use of Our Holiness and Destructive Power.
        Remember, Undead Creatures have no Hearts. Their very existence is an
        insult to Our Task.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">The Gods have also granted us the
        Exclusive Use of Holy Swords, for, if any other than a Paladin were to
        lay their hands upon a Holy Sword, their minds would be swallowed up by
        its power. Use these Swords with the utmost of care. Earn your blades. I&nbsp;encourage
        you to enter the Depths and earn your Holy Sword as you were meant to.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">I hope I have left thee with more
        Resolve. Remember, We are not meant to go about our Tasks easily. Ours
        is the Road of Truthfulness. If it were to come easily, We would not
        become Stronger through the Trials we face.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">Help thy Fellow Paladins, and Go in the
        Light,</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial">Varrus</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font SIZE="+1">PS:</font> I&nbsp;hope you enjoyed
        this letter. I DO&nbsp;feel that Paladins should be granted a
        &quot;type&quot; of Direct Damage spell. But it would not deal damage.
        Some sort of Taunting spell that would enrage the animal to attack you
        would be within our beliefs. Getting creatures to attack you from range
        is more of a gameplay issue than anything else. Why couldn't we yell at
        a creature to get them to attack us? Maybe a spell called Enrage, that
        would have the same range as the majority of Direct Damage spells and
        act like a Taunt times 5 or 10? Undead Creatures that were
        &quot;blue&quot; should certainly attack ANY&nbsp;Paladin that was
        within sight.</font>
