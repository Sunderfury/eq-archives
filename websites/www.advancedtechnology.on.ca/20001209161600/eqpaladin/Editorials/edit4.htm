        <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial">I was never one to
        bitch and complain too much, especially when nothing could be done, but
        after spending a relatively long time in Cazic-Thule, I felt compelled
        to vent. :)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Well, being a 30th level paladin wearing full
        bronze, I decided that is was time to acquire myself some new armor. I
        thought getting ruby would be the last time I would have to worry about
        armor for my character. So off I go to Cazic. Oh was I in for a rude
        awakening. I spent 40 IRL days in Cazic, in an attempt to just get one
        piece of ruby armor. I have failed. All I got for my trip was a level
        and a lizard cloak and about 100 PP - the last 3 things I was shooting
        for. The way I figure, I can always go get money and XP somewhere else,
        like the Rathe Mountains...in any case I had never been so agitated in a
        long time. What angered me? I shall tell you:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">1) People</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I have never seen so many greedy people in one
        place in my entire life. 70% of them could not even use the damned
        armor. I got so tired of seeing verbal wars over OOC and shout I didn't
        even have the OOC/Shout turned on for the last 20 days I was there.
        There were those that tried to be honorable when it camed to the named,
        but they were rare. The biggest problem? Mages. They would be grouped
        up, and they would do nothing but sit there and wait for the named to
        spawn then while the group that was up in the loot order was fighting
        it, they would nuke the hell out of it, loot it, then go back to sit
        down. I could always tell if they got something because you would see
        &quot;Ruby Greaves - 1400 PP&quot; right after the named was killed.
        This caused a lot of problems, and guides would show up on a regular
        basis. It got so bad one night they made the zone off limits for 2
        hours.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I have always been somewhat of a leader, and I
        normally kept track of the TR loot order while in there. On several
        instances, 38-40th level mages would come in...alone..and demand to be
        put into the loot order, while there were already 4-5 other full groups
        waiting their turn. When I would tell them &quot;Ummm...no.&quot; they
        would take it anyway, and the bad thing about it was there was nothing
        anyone could do but watch helplessly as the spawn you had been waiting
        for for 4 hours was getting nuked from some unknown source. I felt so
        sorry for all the 30+ rangers there, still wearing banded. This one 37th
        level bard wearing FULL steel, wielding a Staff of Withering, charmed
        our named once, and we could not attack it, she made it come down to the
        Avatar room where her party was and they killed it, because they were
        bored waiting for the avatar to spawn (40 minutes later they could not
        handle the Avatar and zoned it, killing about 17 people in the process).
        The bad thing about it was I had been playing 16 hours that day and it
        was finally my turn to loot...the Templar dropped the greaves and since
        everyone in that party already had them, they let their wizard take
        them, who said he was going to keep them for his 6th level paladin. On a
        regular basis High level warriors, or casters would come in and make
        themselves invis on the throne, and kill the named before anyone had a
        chance to get up there, many of these warriors were already wearing full
        crafted armor...the stories go on...</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">2) The adopted party loot order</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Pathetic. It was not based off of who needed the
        item the most, but off of who had been in the party the longest. I would
        play for 8 - 12 hours some days and NEVER even get a chance to loot a
        named. I would always end up last in the order, and by the time it even
        remotely got close to me, the others would have gotten what they wanted
        and left, causing me to have to find another party, only to have the
        same thing happen...over and over again. It is a very frustrating cycle.
        So I made a new one...when I led I was the one that looted the named,
        and I would tell the group what it was. If you did not have the item and
        could actually use it, then you rolled a d20, the highest number won the
        loot. If you were a mage or a class that could not use the item, then
        too bad...you were at the back of the bus. This worked very well...and
        it made everything a lot more worthwhile...if you don't get the ruby,
        who are you going to blame? The dice? I ended up handing out 8 pairs of
        ruby greaves over the 40 days...I never got any, I just couldn't roll a
        high number to save my life...but that is the way it goes. One guy sold
        his greaves for 1200 PP because he didn't like the way they looked with
        his steel breastplate. Jeez...since when did the monsters give a damn
        what you looked like?! ::shakes head::</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Here is one instance that happened on the 40th day
        in Cazic that caused me to pack up my stuff and leave:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">4am, there were two parties in the TR. I had been
        there since noon (luckily I had the weekend off) bouncing around various
        groups without success. I finally found a good party of good and
        honorable players who wholeheartedly supported my Random Dice Roll
        Method of loot order. We had been together as a group about 5 hours,
        everyone had greaves that could wear them but me, which meant the next
        pair of greaves would go to me. It was us and another group who had been
        there about 2 hours. They were up on the named. They could not handle
        the Templar and zoned. We killed the Templar and I looted it...behold!
        Ruby Greaves, but being the honorable Paladin Party Leader I decided
        that it belonged to the other group, since it was in fact their turn. My
        party, (Made up of all REAL rangers, clerics and paladins) agreed. When
        they returned they automatically accused us of kill stealing before I
        could even explain, ignoring the abuse I gave their leader the greaves.
        I recieved not one thank you. Well it came our turn, and about 40
        minutes later the Templar spawned again. Over this time they lost their
        ranger (who left with a pair of new ruby greaves) and gained a 35th
        level wizard, which gave them a total of 2 mages a cleric and a shaman.
        While we were organizing our plan of attack, they pulled the Templar
        (along with two gorillas, a justicar, a zealot and a fanatic) and try as
        we could, we lacked the fire power to out point them, but after the
        Templar went down we kept fighting - in a vain attempt to help them. The
        shaman looted the Templar in the middle of combat and I looked up to see
        all of them gone. It was just us and this huge train. In the end I lost
        3 party members and zoned with 5 points left, even after LoH. I came
        through the zone to see the shaman sitting there with her new ruby
        greaves...my ruby greaves. At this point I had had enough and asked her
        is she liked wearing my ruby greaves. After a few curt words she accused
        me of having &quot;Ruby Fever&quot; and that if I was not careful my
        greed would consume me. LOL I then told her that I could have cared less
        about the damned armor, but what I cared about was their dishonorable
        group who went out of order after we gave them their greaves from the
        last named spawn, stole what was rightly ours, and in the process
        leaving us to clean up their mess, which killed 3 of my people! She just
        laughed and said &quot;SOW is a good thing&quot; and &quot;If you
        apologize to me, I will think about giving your group SOW so you all
        won't die so fast&quot; I told her to &quot;Kiss my ass&quot; and made
        sure all my group had their bodies back and left. My group pleaded with
        me to stay, but I had had enough. 3 days later I got a tell from someone
        I didn't even know telling me that the female shaman was back in the TR,
        without any greaves (or pants for that matter) asking &quot;25 shaman
        looking for group...my legs are cold&quot;. Nobody would take her, and
        it seemed word had gotten around about what happened. It seems she sold
        the greaves for 1400 PP and figured she could seduce her way into
        getting some more...which brings up the point of men playing females
        just so they can get free hand-outs, but that is another story for
        another time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">There were several other minor things that really
        annoyed me, but those were the two main ones...all in all, in 40 days I
        spent in Cazic - I accomplished the following:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Good</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-Gained a level</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-Made 104 PP from FS weapons</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-Gained a Lizard Scale Cloak</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Bad (atleast to my point of view)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-Died 23 times</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-Watched 12 party members get an assorted piece of
        ruby...9 of them casters. (Not including the 8 I gave away while I was
        party leader using the dice roll loot order.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-Had 6 named lizards stolen from my party by High
        level casters/warriors/bards.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-Added 7 names to my ignore list</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-Had a pair of greaves stolen from me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">-Smoked 12 cartons of cigarettes and drank approx.
        15 pots of coffee and 22 crown and cokes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I am sure there are other minor small things, but
        I think you get the point...you make the call..did I benefit from this
        trip to Cazic to get better armor? Considering the fact that I still
        don't have any, I would say no. I could care less about the armor if I
        had fun...but do you think I had any fun? Ummm...no. So you know what I
        did? I left. I am going to get Soulfire, some crested or mithril armor,
        then come back to Cazic and say &quot;Remember me? Oh yeah! You want me
        to help you get what?&quot; I am going to get ruby armor and give it
        away to the hard working people who have been there for days, but kept
        getting shafted.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Ruby Fever&quot; is a disease for sure, a
        disease commonly called Greed, and I am proud to say to this date I am
        not infected and never will be for that matter. Someone told me once
        that I am not greedy enough to get ruby...and they were exactly
        right...I am not.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">It all comes down to this: There are several
        people in EQ who have really pathetic lives, lives so devoid of
        attention and success that they feel they must be the center of
        attention and be the most powerful person in an on-line Role Playing
        Game...people who don't care about surviving, or accomplishing
        goals/quests, or role playing, people who don't care about the things
        this game was really created for - these people only care for one thing
        - themselves. All they care about is &quot;Hey look at me and what I
        have that you don't!&quot; They wallow in the adultation of newbies like
        pigs in slop, hence all the pathetic over-twinking. It's these kind of
        people that make me sick, but on the other hand, I have to laugh,
        because I know that if EQ all of a sudden did not exist anymore...I
        wouldn't mind, because my bills are paid, I live in a nice place and
        drive a nice car and a good job. I wouldn't mind because I am secure
        enough in myself as a person that these 40-50th level morons who eat,
        sleep and shit EQ would not bother me (present company not included of
        course, you guys know what I mean. :) ). I wouldn't mind because I could
        always find a book to read, a picture to draw or a story to write...I
        could always get together with my friends and play AD&amp;D, knowing the
        whole time that these people would be like a crack fiend without a fix
        in 2 weeks. ::smiles:: I promise you...ever since I adopted this
        attitude, I have had sooo much fun. It doesn't bother me as much anymore
        if I die, or get a kill stolen. Give it a try. :)</font></p>
