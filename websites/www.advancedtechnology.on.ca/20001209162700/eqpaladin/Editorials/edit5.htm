        <p>There are many arguments as to how a paladin should be played based
        on the type of player you are. I for one am a role player so many power
        gamers might never see my points. The Paladin is a holy fighter who can
        be played in different ways but all circle around the same basic idea. A
        Paladin serves his God and his religion first. The Paladin is a just and
        mighty warrior able to detect evil and deal with it in short order. The
        Paladin shelters the weak and defends the oppressed, they are the
        shining light in a world of strife.</p>
        <p>A Paladin is granted his gifts through the priests of his deity and
        is expected to follow the beliefs of his religion. In Everquest any Joe
        off the street can choose to play a Paladin and because of this the
        class can be diluted. Normally it is very hard to become a Paladin and
        even harder to live the life of one. Paladins are not the strongest
        fighters or the best healers. The idea is that they are a capable
        fighter who can tend to themselves when all is said and done. They are
        their deity's champions, enforcing their will throughout the land.</p>
        <p>I enjoy my Paladin because it is the character I have role played for
        years. They heal the wounded, cure the ills of the sick, bring hope to
        the beaten, and hunt down evil wherever it may roam. In my travels
        across the lands I heal those that need it without being asked to do so.
        I hear someone is poisoned or diseased and cure them of their ailments.
        I see a poor soul who caught the back end of a nasty train and use my
        LoH that they might escape. I have stepped in front of a mob dishing out
        too much damage for someone to take so that I may free them to kill the
        creature unharmed any further.</p>
        <p>Other Paladins may not do these things but it does not make them any
        less a Paladin, just a different one. Maybe a servant of Mithaniel Marr
        chooses to only do these things for humans. Due to the extreme ability
        the player has to role play a Paladin in Everquest it would have been
        nice if there was a deeper detail to what the particular gods would
        expect of their followers in this role. I am a follower of Brell but I
        am still attuned to the Followers of Tunare, and the Followers of Marr.
        I am not better than they and they are not better than me, for no matter
        what differences we may have we are all after the same major goal, to
        thwart evil.</p>
        <p>I believe the class as a whole could have been handled better in a
        few ways than it was and that is another reason for this write up. By
        allowing anyone but a human to become a paladin Verant went against the
        grain, though this is an aspect I rather like. On the other hand, they
        also allowed a paladin to be an agnostic and that is something I just
        can't agree with. A Paladin is a holy warrior and to be such you must
        follow a God. If no God is worshipped than exactly who is bestowing the
        gifts upon this warrior?</p>
        <p>A Paladin is a devout warrior of his god. Depending on the lore you
        know you have heard of a Paladin smiting a vile creature single
        handedly, or maybe you heard of a group of five paladins doing what a
        regular army couldn't. The way I like to look at this is simple enough.
        A solo, 45 level Paladin slays a creature of 35 that is terrorizing a
        certain area and the people of the area cheer him. A group of five level
        45 paladins slay a monster that was otherwise eating groups alive
        because they lacked healing, or spells fizzled, or no buffs were
        available.</p>
        <p>Paladins alone can do little but teamed together they can indeed be a
        nasty force to reckon with. A Paladin can shine in just about any group,
        they can take damage for their team, they can heal members who were
        injured. Yes, they can practically bring a person from near death to
        full health with a touch of their hands once a day. My healing right now
        is not that strong, but to a spellcaster it is more than enough. My
        damage potential is not the highest in the group, but with my other
        abilities in reserve, it is enough.</p>
        <p>As a reward for my sacrifices, yes I die quite a bit for my groups
        and even for perfect strangers, I am blessed with holy weapons and
        armor. Well, this may be where things tend to hit a decline. If
        Everquest was a real life situation no one would be complaining of class
        balance because it would all come down to how much work you put into
        your ability. Paladins are known to be workaholics always in search of a
        quest, especially if the quest is for a holy item they know their god
        would not want to fall into the wrong hands. They practice humility and
        do as their God bids without question. For this they are rewarded with
        some of the finest equipment to aid them in their god's work.</p>
        <p>Everyone has heard the complaints about the holy swords being weak
        for some time. Everyone has heard the sudden uproar over the Armour of
        Ro quests. Few understand why Paladins are truly crying foul. The work
        is expected, Paladins learn that they are given nothing easily, but what
        they have worked so hard for is something that will define them further
        as a Holy Knight. According to belief there should be no weapon made by
        man more powerful than one made by a God for a Paladin. On the same note
        the weapons made by the Gods for their avatars (I choose to believe that
        cazic thule in PoF is just an embodiment of the God himself etc.) should
        be stronger than those of the Paladin. The same would hold true for the
        armor.</p>
        <p>This by no means defines any one aspect of the ability of a holy
        sword. For example, a warrior may wield a weapon that in fact does more
        raw melee damage, but a Holy Sword will have some blessing that makes it
        the weapon of choice to a Paladin. Ghoulbane was a good example of this
        as it has an effect that hurts undead. There is a shortage of holy
        weapons as it is, there should at least be one per Paladin God. There
        should be real effects associated with the swords and they should not be
        limited. (i.e. Soulfire with 5 charges of healing) If you use up all the
        charges of the Soulfire it is, in essence, no longer a holy sword, the
        gift bestowed is now used up and it is now a normal weapon, man makes
        weapons like that, not Gods.</p>
        <p>Paladins are usually the member of a group most eager to take the
        beating, it is what their God wishes. To aid them in doing this their
        God bestows upon them the ability to take that beating a little better
        than most. Verant did a good job with the spells for a Paladin, but the
        Armour of Ro is lacking at best, you don't just run to the store and buy
        this armor. Verant also made taunt a very weak skill. To prove this
        point you can usually find a Paladin in a group casting Flash of Light
        to further try and upset a mob. Later in life a Paladin can use greater
        heal to effectively keep that mob on him. Paladins were not meant to
        dual wield or use skills like kick, they use taunt, they use bash and
        normally they are very good at these two skills. Verant seems to think
        otherwise, not exactly sure why.</p>
        <p>All in all, the Paladin as a class is not all that bad, the fixes
        that would be needed for them would appear relatively easy to implement.
        The people who play Paladins and ask for certain skills to be improved
        are asking for the good of people they fight with. What good does taunt
        do for the solo Paladin? The request for more 1HS holy swords is valid,
        what good is bash if you can never hold a shield to do so with? Quests
        for these items need to be better thought out and implemented, a Paladin
        would never be asked to kill another Paladin for his weapon. In most
        ideals of the Paladin order this would be grounds for losing one's
        Paladin status. Permanently remaining KOS in Freeport for killing the
        leader of the corrupt Militia is nonsense. The flag should dissipate
        over time as in a RL scenario the corrupt Militia would in fact be
        disbanded.</p>
        <p>I am having fun playing my Paladin, and yes I could have a lot more.
        There is much to be done in this world and there are things to be left
        alone. If no one brings up the things that need change than change will
        never happen and what a boring world this would be. I for one think many
        of the things that are not correct in the world now come from poor
        planning, but that is for another write up.</p>
