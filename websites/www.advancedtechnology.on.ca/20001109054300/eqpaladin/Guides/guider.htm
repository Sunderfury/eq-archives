        <p align="center"><strong><font face="Arial">By Rolan of COR</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I play a level 23 human paladin by the name of
        Rolan on the Tarrew Marr server. He's a follower of Mithaniel Marr, the
        LightBringer. So I suppose I have a few things to say about what it
        takes to be a Paladin.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><b>Creating your character:</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I chose to play a human, but race selection is a
        personal choice. Remember when creating your character that it doesn't
        pay to have any real weak areas, but most definitely put most of your
        extra points into strength. Wearing full plate is extremely heavy. I am
        usually at around 70/90 even before I start adventuring, and I am in
        Banded armor, not even plate yet.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><b>Skills:</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Basically do not neglect any of your skills. You
        don't know what the future holds, so why be unprepared? The debate over
        whether 1h or 2h is better for a paladin is a moot point if you are a
        master in all weaponry. Just use the one that helps you the most at
        diffrent times in your growth as a paladin. I personally started out
        with 2h slash, for the increased damage, allowing me to solo more I
        think when friends weren't around. I am leaning more towards 1h slash
        now, at level 23, as I have a good shield and need to be the damage
        taker in groups (I'm not a tank, I don't fire large bullets nor have
        treads). Thats the crux of the 1h vs. 2h difference I think. 1h weapons
        combined with Bash makes you a good damage taker in a group. But a
        paladin equipped with a good 2h handed sword can solo better I think.
        Use the weapon that is best suited to the type of adventuring you are
        going to be doing, solo or grouped.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Neglecting 1h blunt is also a mistake, since you'd
        be suprised how many times you are going to need to pull your body out
        of the depths of some nasty dungeon. Your Hammer of Wrath or Striking is
        going to be your only weapon, so you better know how to use it. Anybody
        that says Hammer of Wrath is a waste of money hasn't had to use it to
        get their body out of a nightmare like Guk or Najena.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Taunt-</b> Max it out or you won't have many
        friends. If you can't keep monsters off of spell casters, they are going
        to find a new damage taker.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Bash-</b> Extremely useful when fighting
        spellcasters to interrupt them. Don't neglect it. Obviously requires you
        are good at 1h slash or blunt.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Additionally, there are a couple of skills as a
        paladin that you have to put a lot of points in at first. You don't need
        to train Conjuration and Evocation till level 15, but when you do plan
        on splitting, 20 to 40 skill points between them. Otherwise you will
        have a difficult time with Ward Undead or the Hammer of Wrath summoning.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><b>Good weapons for a paladin:</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">If you are a paladin, you have to have a magic
        weapon above level 12 or so. Most higher level undead can't be hit by
        normal weapons.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>2h slash-</b> Get your hands on a fine steel 2
        handed sword for use till level 12 or so, then I hope you got some money
        saved up. You can either get a combine 2 handed sword for around 110 pp
        from a gypsie, or save a bit more and get your hands on a Shiny Brass
        Halberd from nother player. At around level 16 you have entered the
        level range where adventuring to attain magic weapons becomes possible.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>1h slash-</b> A Combine longsword costs around
        55 pp. Its a good magic weapon for someone around level 12 to 16. Beyond
        that I'd advise more adventuring to discover some other magic 1h slash
        weapons.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>1h blunt-</b> You can get the Hammer of Wrath
        spell at level 15. Again, you have to have saved up some skill points to
        put into conjuration, or you won't be able to summon a hammer. It is an
        ok magic weapon, and is best used as a backup to defend yourself while
        recovering your corpse.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>2h blunt-</b> There is no easy way for a
        paladin to train in this weapon skill that I have found. The lowest
        level weapon that I've seen that a paladin can wield is found on a
        roughy level 23 monster. So I've neglected this skill, maybe in the
        future I'll train it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">One other point worth mentioning. There are sites
        out there that will give you large lists of magic items, and based on
        those a paladin should use 1h or 2h slash as his primary weapon skill.
        The thing is those sites have barely scratched the surface I think. Is
        there a Holy Hammer out there? Can anyone tell me definitively that it
        does not exist? Is the Fiery Avenger 1h or 2h? What about the other Holy
        Swords? All those questions don't matter if you are a skilled armsman.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><b>Armor:</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">If you can find a good source of raw-hide armor in
        your size, get yourself a full set and then save to buy Banded Armor
        from a player smith. While saving you'll probably come accross some
        ringmail armor as loot. Its heavy but better than leather based armor. I
        wouldn't buy it though. If you don't know much about the different armor
        types, they are roughly in this order of usefullness for paladins.
        Cloth, patchwork, Raw-hide, Leather, Ringmail, Chainmail, Bronze plate,
        Banded (debateable), regular plate, magic plate. The reason I put Banded
        as higher than bronze plate is that Banded armor is between chainmail
        and plate in AC, but is the same weight as chainmail. Bronze plate is
        25% heavier than regular plate. If you are incredibly strong you can get
        away with wearing it, but as for me I prefer to wear banded until I can
        afford regular plate, or magic plate/chainmail.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Thats about all the advice I can give. I hope this
        helps any paladins out there that are just starting out. =)</font></p>
