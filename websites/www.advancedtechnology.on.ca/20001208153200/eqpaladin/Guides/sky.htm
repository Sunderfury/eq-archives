        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Here is ALL the relevant details on
        current targets in the Plane of Sky that I’ve been compiling over the
        past few months. All the info up to Drake Isle is complete. Here it is,
        the Plane of Sky (Note: VERY VERY LONG and *MAJOR* spoilers, but no
        strategies included):<br>
        <br>
        </font><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Key Master Isle:</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Thunder Spirits</b> (8 of them on Key
        Master Isle, level 50) Look like Faeries, they hit for up to 160 and
        will proc 'Choke' on their target randomly, which takes 10 str off of
        their target and does a small DoT. Relatively low HP, AC, and Resists,
        they go down fairly quick. They randomly drop all types of Tesseras,
        three Mini-Swords and three Rabbits Feet. Hand the Mini-Swords and
        Rabbits Feet to Sirran the Lunatic to receive a Key of Swords and a Key
        of the Misplaced, respectively.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Thunder Spirit Princess</b> (Boss on Key Master Isle, level 53) Looks
        like a Faerie, she hits for mid 200s and will proc 'Choke' on her
        target. Moderate HP, AC, and Resists. Usually empty, but will rarely
        have a piece of rare loot (Hast Belt, etc). Her death triggers the spawn
        of Sirran the Lunatic, who, upon giving him a Mini-Sword or Rabbits
        Foot, will hand you a Key of Swords or a Key of the Misplaced,
        respectively.<br>
        <br>

        </font><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Azarack Isle:</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Azarack</b> (9 on Azarack Isle, level
        53) Looks like an Imp from SolB, they hit for up to 190 and proc a spell
        called Whirlbolt (Levitate, Root, 400 dmg DoT) on their target. 12k HP,
        moderate AC, and strange spell resists (one half of the Azaracks are
        resistant to cold, the other half to fire). They can be mezzed. They
        randomly drop all types of Disc quest items, and 1-3 Broken Mirrors.
        Handing the Broken Mirror to Sirran the Lunatic will give you a Key
        which will enable access to the Gorgalosk Isle. Killing the Place-Holder
        on this island (distinguishable by the fact that it hits for 220 instead
        of 190) will spawn the Protector of Sky, the boss of the island.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Protector of Sky</b> (Boss of Azarack Isle, level 55) A giant version
        of his Azarack counterpart, he hits for 300+ and procs Whirlbolt (Levi,
        400 dmg DoT) on his target. High HP, AC, Resists. Drops one rare item
        (Haste Belt, etc.), one rare quest item, and 4 Broken Mirrors. His death
        triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, upon giving him a Broken

        and cast Lightning, an unresistable AoE, Blind, and Root. Drops Spiroc

        in pairs (Arbiter &amp; Banisher, Caller &amp; Walker, Expulser &amp;
        Revolter), and these pairs are in turn associated with the Vanquisher
        that roams around them (they roam around their individual ‘houses’
        in these pairs). The associated Vanquisher must be killed before the
        pairs of Rooks can be killed, otherwise the Rooks will respawn. The
        Rooks can be mezzed quite easily.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Spiroc Vanquisher</b> (3 on Spiroc Isle, level 58) A bit tougher than
        the Rooks, Spiroc Vanquishers wander near to its associated Rook pairs.
        These must be killed before the Rooks can be killed. They drop 8 Noise
        Makers that enable access to Bzzazzt Isle. Enrages towards the end of

        50) Look like Wasps from newbie zones, hit for 390, and cast Deadly
        Poison (1200 DoT) spell on target. Not very magic resistant, and can be
        mezzed easily (and charmed too with some work). Each Bzzazzt drops 8
        Dull Dragon Scales, which enable access to Drake Isle. Main quest items
        for this island are ‘Honey’-type items.&nbsp; (Note: All other
        spawns after the initial Bzzazzt seem to be completely magic resistant
        except for Lure-type spells, and ALL of the other spawns Enrage towards
        the end of the fight, which sucks especially since they all hit for 600+
        heh)<br>
        <br>
        <b>Left Bzzazzt </b>(when facing them from behind), when killed, spawns
        2 level 55 Bazzzazzts (completely magic resistant and hit for 500s), and
        each of their deaths will spawn a level 60 Bizazzt (hit for 700s and
        also completely resistant) (Note: this is just like the spawn cycle for
        Pegasi/Griffons from Pegasus Isle).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Right Bzzazzt</b> when killed, spawns 3 level 55 Bazzzazzts at once.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Middle Bzzazzt</b> when killed, spawns 1 level 55 Bazzzazzt, who's
        death triggers the spawn of the level 60 Bzzt (a bixie, hits for 700s),
        who's death triggers the spawn of the final boss, level 63 Bazzt Zzzt
        (another bixie, hits for 850, DTs, has an island-covering AoE *disease*
        spell), for a grand total of 2 Wasps, 2 Bixies for the Middle Bzzazzt.
        Its death will trigger the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given
        a Dull Dragon Scale, will give you a Key that will enable access to the
        Drake Isle.<br>
        <br>
        (Note: The splits have a somewhat low aggro radius, and thus you can do
        CR on the island with them spawned and get another try at them if you
        have a wipe-out. Beware though, the splits have a despawn timer of
        between 60 and 80 minutes)<br>

        <b>Greater Sphinx </b>(8 on Drake Isle, level 54) Enchanter-type mob,
        assembled in pairs around the temple in the middle of the island. Each
        of them DTs, making pulling tricky (and we may have to fight multiple
        DTing mobs at once).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Undine Spirit </b>(8? on Drake Isle, level 53) Cleric wisp, found

        Isle, level 60+) Looks like a butterfly, supposed boss of the entire
        Plane of Sky, or at least the trigger for something even bigger. Looks
        like a cute cuddly butterfly.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Hand of Veeshan</b> (1 on Butterfly Isle, level 60+) Triggered by the

        Efreetis.<br>

        There you have it folks. The last two islands’ info is a bit bare
        since we’ve never actually been there...but that’ll change soon ;)
        And also note that none of this info comes from ShowEQ, just from months
        and months of raiding my favorite zone in EQ =P</font></p>
