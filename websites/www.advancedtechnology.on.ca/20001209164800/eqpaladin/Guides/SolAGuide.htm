        <p><font face="Arial">Having found Ferrik Bloodforge’s treatise on
        Solusek A I decided to venture to that remote dungeon myself. What a
        wonderful surprise, I have enjoyed my time there immeasurably. I put pen
        to parchment now in the hopes that others can benefit from my
        experiences. I have written much of this from a Paladin’s prospective.
        For this I do not apologize, for I am, after a Paladin.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">Greyfin’s rules for Solusek A<br>
        </font></b><font face="Arial"><br>
        1. Don’t fall into the lava<br>
        2. Don’t forget rule 1<br>
        3. Don’t pull on the stairs. If you do you will eventually fall into
        the lava and break rules 1, 2 and 6.<br>
        4. Know where the nearest zone to Sol B is. As strange as it sounds
        it’s a good place to escape to. Sure sometimes you die when trains
        collide, but that is very rare.<br>
        5. Once down the stairs and inside the &quot;window room&quot; don’t
        run back up to the stairs to zone. Use the Sol B zone near the
        &quot;safe spot.&quot;<br>
        6. Don’t swim in the lava<br>
        7. NO RUNNERS: ensnare or root everything.<br>
        8. IF there is a runner, RUN, gate or die. Don’t wait for the dam to
        break. It already has you just can’t see the wall of water about to
        fall on your head. If you let a goblin escape you will see the gates of
        hell open up. Shout TRAIN! and scoot.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">9. If it moves, kill it. Many of the NPC’s
        wander around Sol A. All the NPC’s have place holders. If you’re
        looking for any of these you have to kill the wanderers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">10. Don’t cast Area Effect spells unless you
        know EXACTLY where you are. I’ve seen many a caster die because the
        employees of the Solusek Mining Company are so short they weren’t
        seen...<br>
        11. Always have batwings (see rules 1, 2 and 6) make sure everyone in
        your party has one or two (the worst feeling in the world is when the
        guy with all the batwings is at the bottom of the lava stream).<br>
        12. No one dies. Go slow, follow the rules and Rule 11 will rarely be
        broken.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><br>
        <b>About Lava</b>: Just about everyone has heard that the lava at Sol A
        is bad. Because of this, often people do not want to go to there. Well,
        I’m here to tell you it’s not that bad at all. 95% of the BAD lava
        is in the first 10% of the dungeon. Go slowly, pull whatever is on the
        stairs back to the top and no one should fall in. Falling into the lava
        is a pain because you have to retrieve your corpse and only you can do
        it (others can’t do it because they can’t target your corpse when
        it’s in lava. Well, not unless they want to go swimming to find it).
        IF you do fall in, get as close as you can to the corner near the window
        (keep reading you'll understand soon). I’ve seen people drag their
        body from the path/stairs when they died in this area. If you don’t
        get lucky you will have to levitate and drag you corpse either back onto
        the path or further on you will eventually find some stone where you can
        bring your body. I would suggest you just getting back onto the path.<br>
        <br>
        Now sometimes Levitate doesn’t float you high enough to get back on
        the path. This can happen for 2 reasons: you follow the lava stream to a
        pathway that leads down and the roof will force you down and sometimes
        levitate will drop you below the path, but above the lava for no reason.
        DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAVA WHERE IT ENTERS THE TUNNEL (the one that leads
        down). Nothing good will come of it. If your body is in the lava and you
        can’t find it, don’t go here to look. It’s not down there, the
        only way bodies get there is if you drag it there, whatever you do NEVER
        DRAG YOUR BODY DOWN THIS TUNNEL. IF you end up floating above the lava
        but too low to get back on the path for no reason you can try and climb
        back up the wall (it works sometimes) or contact a GM/Guide. I have had
        great success with asking guides and GM’s for help with this bug (they
        usually teleport me out, so loot your corpse before you ask for help<br>
        <br>
        ONE TIME I fell into the lava and was able to successfully CLIMB THE
        WALL and get out of the lava. I was never able to do it again and no one
        I know has done it, but it’s worth trying. Find the corner near the
        window room and try and climb up, like you would a ladder.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p><font face="Arial">&quot;The best way to avoid the initial lava is to
        go in through Sol B. Enter Sol B and make all lefts that you can until
        you zone into Sol A... With Sol B as heavily camped as it is there
        should be no problem doing this.&quot;</font></p>

        <b>GETTING THERE</b>: Solusek’s Eye, (Sol A) can be found in Lavastorm
        Mountains (LS). It is often mistaken for Nagafen’s Lair (Sol B). This
        causes some confusion and the misperception that it is a very high level
        dungeon: it’s not as hard as you think. Sol B is an extremely
        difficult dungeon, don’t expect to go to Sol B till you’re well into
        your 30’s (and from what I’ve heard, you don’t need to leave
        before 50). Now don’t get me wrong, Sol A is not easy; I’ve seen
        parties in there high 30’s have trouble there. I’m just saying a lot
        of people come too late. I got there around level 23 and had great fun.
        In fact, it’s a much harder dungeon after level 27; now you have to
        fight your way past annoying greens to get experience.<br>
        <br>
        <b>THE LOOT: </b>I found the experience and the loot to be greater than
        many of the other areas people of my level were fighting in (Mistmoore,
        Unrest, Cazic Thule, Permafrost and High Hold Keep) and certainly the
        train makes less stops in Sol A then in MM, Unrest and CZ. The
        experience is great here. I will finish this guide with some ideas about
        where to go to get the most experience, you can skip there now, but it
        won’t mean as much to you until you’ve read the whole guide. I love
        this dungeon. With everyone complaining about overcrowding, I am
        constantly amazed at how few people are at Solusek A. With the recent
        invasion of Splitpaw Solusek don’t expect anything to change either
        (which is a good thing, IMHO). I have included a quick reference at the
        end of this guide.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">ON BINDING</font></b><font face="Arial">: Freeport
        is the typical binding point for melee types who can’t get bound in
        Neriak. I suggest binding in High Hold Pass. It’s a little farther to
        run than Freeport, but you can always get a Spirit of the Wolf and that
        is nice in the low 20’s when you’re running though Nektulos Forest.
        Around level 27 I started binding in Freeport. There was a rumor you
        could bind in the Solusek Temple (that would have been nice) it’s not
        true.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">*** With the changes made to Kithicor Forest you
        may want to skip High Hold Pass and just bind in Freeport.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><br>
        <b>OF INTEREST</b>: Dwarves and, I heard a rumor, Erudites, are not KOS
        to the Goblins in Sol A unless you have done something to lose faction
        with them (it took me about 1 whole level to become KOS)… I spent 2
        days walking around Sol A, learning my way around. Except for 4 mobs (2
        of which are NPC’s there is nothing in Sol A that will bother a
        sight-seeing dwarf (so pack a lunch and bring the kids).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">*** There is a rumor that the Gnomish Vendor in
        the Castle sells Melatite. It’s not true. Like all vendors he sells it
        if another Player sold it to him. And before people knew how to do the
        Armor of Ro quests I’m sure players sold it to him, not anymore. So
        don’t get your hopes up.**</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Invis doesn’t work very well in Sol A as all the
        spell casters and the gnomes can see invis.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><br>
        Killing Kobolds in Sol B will raise your faction with Solusek Mining
        Company (but not the Ak’anon faction). A useful thing to know if
        you’re an evil race (since you’re KOS to the Mining Company
        otherwise) or anyone who plans to camp the employees of the Solusek
        Mining Company and their mechanicals. This isn’t really an option
        before level 30, although I did venture down here and take swings at
        some kobolds when I was in my 20’s, but only when others were actually
        fighting them. I still haven’t raised my faction above indifferent.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">*** Paladins can solo here from lvl22 - 27 (after
        27 you stop getting exp)... It's not great but since we rarely get to
        solo anything it's fun for a change and this is better than running
        somewhere else to fight... Pull to the Sol B room and root when the
        goblins get near 40%... Even if they do run you should have time to
        catch them, if you don't they'll train, but you'll have time to zone to
        Sol B. I’ve solo’d the Predator room and the Foreman rooms at level
        31, but I wouldn’t recommend it until you learn the zone very well (or
        after level 35)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>THE SAFE AREA</b>: Ferrick identified 2 areas
        in Sol A, the Goblin Stronghold and the Gnome Castle. The only thing I
        will do is add another area, I call it the safe area. It’s
        &quot;safe&quot; because because nothing spawns on this side of Sol A.
        Unless someone pulls/trains something, you will not see any Goblins
        here. There is also a relatively safe zone to Sol B here, for escape
        purposes. The safe area is good place to rest, meditate and even camp.
        It’s also a useful reference point (&quot;meet you in the safe
        area&quot;). Getting there is very easy. After zoning in you will see
        some stairs. At the midway point you will find a window (some call it a
        crack). This room and the one that adjoins it I call the window room.
        The window room has 2 exits: one leading back to the stairs (I never
        bother with this exit, using the window instead) and one that leads to a
        ledge (I will come back here a lot, when I say &quot;the ledge&quot; I
        mean here). At the ledge, if you take a right, you will enter a hallway
        that opens up to a path leading down and a bridge that dead-ends into
        the wall. This is the safe area. Continuing down the ramp, you come to a
        room and a short hall to the Sol B zone. I refer to this room simply as
        the Sol B room (for obvious reasons).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Back to the ledge, there is a door straight ahead
        of you in a small pit-like area (jump or take the stairs). It leads to
        the Goblin Stronghold. This is where you will find the Goblin King, the
        Goblin Bartender, the Goblin Drunkard (who new they drank so much?) the
        Goblin High Shaman and the Infernal Torturer. Solusek Goblins (the
        toughest kind there is in Solusek – go figure) can only be found in
        the stronghold.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Castle area is where the employees of the
        Solusek Mining Company live. This does not mean there are no Goblins in
        the &quot;Castle area.&quot; They just don’t live in the
        Castle-proper. In fact, there are as many goblins living in this area as
        in the Stronghold. In the Castle area you will find some very nice
        NPC’s: Kindle, Singe, the Goblin Foreman, the Kobold Predator, the
        Goblin Captain, The Clockwork EXG, Gabbie Mardoddle, Reckless Efreeti
        (I’ll include their drops when I talk about where to find them),
        Captain Bipnipple and the Lava Elemental.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">KOBOLD PREDATOR AND THE GOBLIN FOREMAN</font></b><font face="Arial">:
        From the ledge (you’re facing the doorway to the Goblin Stronghold),
        turning left you will see some Goblins (at least 2, but very often there
        is a wandering goblin there as well). There is a hallway to the left.
        This is the &quot;hard way&quot; to the<b> </b>Predator room as you will
        have to fight about 12-15 goblins to get here, but if you’re with evil
        races you have to go this way as they are KOS to the employees of the
        Solusek Mining Company. Take it, continuing straight over the bridge
        (more lava). Eventually you will come to a hallway leading to the left.
        At the end of this hall you come to a door. The <b>Kobold Predator </b>is
        often behind this door (he wanders up and down the hall). Like most of
        the spawns in Sol A the Predator is roughly a 20 minute spawn. But he
        has place-holders, I’ve seen him spawn twice in a 6 hour stretch and 4
        times in a row another time. The Predator drops Kobold-Hide Boots (AC5
        +3 AGI +10 HP) and the rare Obsidian Shard (6 dmg 25 dly Effect:
        Obsidian Shatter – 30 point Direct Damage AND reduces AC by about 30
        points, a very nice spell).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">**Note: I’ve been told that Obsidian Shatter is
        a fire based spell and as such is not very useful in Sol A as the
        goblins there have high fire resistance (go figure).**</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">You’ll have to fight your way to hallway (unless
        you get lucky with invis and there are no casters on the path.) Once you
        get to hall you can rest (don’t sit too close to the doorways). The
        nice thing is the hall is safe as only 1 MOB will venture in here. The
        good news is that mob is the Predator or his placeholder, a goblin.
        Either way kill anything you see in this hall. Open the door and you
        will be on a landing at the top of some stairs. The Predator spawns on
        this landing. Kill whatever is here. The nice thing is you will not agro
        the 2 goblins in the room below. When you’re done go down and clear
        the other 2 goblins. There is one exit (other than the one you came in)
        in this room. Through that door there are 3 goblins in here. The one in
        the middle is the <b>Goblin Foreman</b> (behind the well-like
        structure). He drops the Foreman Tunic (10AC 0 weight +3 STR +3 WIS) or
        the Obsidian Scimitar (6 dmg 27 dly +6 AGI). Like most of the spawns in
        Sol A, his is roughly a 20 mins spawn. But he has place-holders, I’ve
        seen him spawn twice in a 6 hour stretch and 4 times in a row another
        time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A full group of mid-20’s can handle both these
        rooms. Around level 27 I could handle both rooms with 2 other people. At
        30 I could handle the Predator room by myself. (it’s very hard to
        break up the Foreman room solo, but I’ve done it. I wouldn’t suggest
        it till you know what you’re doing. In the back of the Foreman room is
        a secret door. The hallway behind here is very safe. Goblins don’t
        wander through here unless pulled.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Now, the easy way into the Foreman/Predator rooms.
        Go back to the ledge take a left again, but this time keep going.
        There’s a small alcove with 2 goblins fairly close, continue on. You
        will come to another small alcove with your first Gnome Mechanical in
        it. Don’t fight him unless your in your 30’s, have a good group and
        don’t mind the faction hits. From the alcove there is a sharp (very
        easy to miss) left that leads to an L-shaped bridge (more lava). Go
        across. When you reach the end of the bridge, stop. There is a hallway
        to your left (again, VERY easy to miss) take it. You will pass a doorway
        and go up some small steps, when you come to a charred section of the
        wall on your right (same wall the door was on) stop. This charred
        section is actually a secret door, go through it. You are now in the
        secret hallway that leads to the Foreman room. Go forward and take your
        first left, then right, then left again and you should be looking at a
        another secret doorway (you can tell by the small holes in the surface,
        if you see them – they’re usually more visible from the back side).
        Well, we’re back to the secret door to the Goblin Foreman room.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">SINGE AND KINDLE</font></b><font face="Arial">:
        Two NPC’s, they fly around the Castle area (never venturing into the
        castle-proper). Like all the other NPC’s in Sol A they have
        place-holders. My best advice is whack any wondering goblin you see
        (rule #9). They were blue to me at 27, but hit hard (IMHO Singe hits
        harder). They wander all over the castle area. <b>Singe</b>, a Fire
        Drake, sometimes goes as far as the ledge over by the Stronghold. Singe
        commonly drops the Obsidian Bead Hoop (AC2 +3 AGI +3 INT – I’ve
        traded them to spell-casters for some very nice items) and rarely the
        Drake Scale Belt (AC5 +3 DEX +10 vs Fire – spell-casters love em).
        Personally I’ve killed Singe a dozen times and I’ve never seen the
        belt, so I’m starting to have my doubts. Maybe it’s a myth. <b>Kindle</b>,
        a Fire Imp, I see much less frequently. I don’t know why maybe I’m
        unlucky. Some other possibilities: he makes less noise than Singe
        (who’s screach can be heard a good distance away) so people aren’t,
        so apt to no he’s around , he roams less or people tend to kill his
        place-holder less often. Kindle’s drop is either the boring Obsidian
        Ring (AC3 +3 DEX +10 HP) or the Imp Skin Gloves (AC2 +5 INT +10 Mana –
        spell-casters love em).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Back to the secret hall behind the Foreman room.
        If you’re facing the room, there is a hall that branches off to your
        right. Follow this and you will come to another secret door, you will
        enter a room with 3 doors and 2-3 goblins. These goblins are nastier
        (flame, fire and inferno) than the ones you’ve seen so fare, so be
        prepared for a fight. I’m told that Singe spawns in this room. I have
        never seen him in this room, but that’s the legend. The door to the
        left leads to a Sol B zone B (a very useful escape route! – see rule
        5). The door straight ahead is the one we want. Open the door and move
        forward. There are 3 (maybe 2?) goblins in this area, if you follow the
        left wall you will find another zone to Sol B (a very useful escape
        route! – see rule 5). IF you go through the door, walk forward a bit
        and turn around you will see an exit to your left (it’s, very easy to
        miss). You will see some stairs up and a tunnel entrance. There is one
        goblin in the corner of this area and another on top of the stairs on
        the ledge. Most times, if I was lucky enough to find him, I found Singe
        on this ledge.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">If you go into the tunnel you will sometimes run
        into Kindle. It’s a dangerous place as there are many goblins down
        here. Since Kindle likes to wander, I really wouldn’t recommend it
        going down here to hunt him unless you really know what you’re doing
        or have good faction with the Goblins. Back to the ledge where we
        hopefully find Singe… There’s a door on this ledge, go in. You’re
        now in a short hallway go through the next door. You will find yourself
        into a room with a table and a 2<sup>nd</sup> door in the far wall. IF
        you go to the right hand corner you will find a secret door. This leads
        down to a pit where the Reckless Efreeti Spawns</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Reckless Efreeti</font></b><font face="Arial">:
        My favorite Graphic in the game, to date (I love the laugh too). He
        drops two very nice items: Platinum Armbands (0 AC +3 WIS +3 STR –
        druids love em, as will your occasional High Elf Cleric) and the rare
        Obsidian Flamberge (20 dmg 50 dly effect: Obsidian Shatter PAL WAR SK 2H
        Sword - No Drop/Lore). Not as good as the Gigantic Zweihander, but
        it’s a nice 2-handed weapon, especially since practically no one has
        heard of it). He has company, 2 Blazings Elementals, around their
        mid-20’s they are aggro to everyone. This includes those lucky Dwarves
        and Erudites who have been walking around Sol A without a care in the
        world… I haven’t made up my mind if the Efreeti is aggro or not.
        Sometimes, he just sits there, sometimes, he attacks. His spawn rate is
        not the typical 20 minutes. Ferrick stated that he missed a round,
        putting him on a 40 minute spawn cycle, but whenever I timed his spawn,
        it seemed a little more random (between 35 and 55 mins). Like all the
        other spawns in Sol A has a place-holder, another Blazing elemental.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Goblin Captain</font></b><font face="Arial">:
        The Captain is very close to the Efreeti. But be warned it’s a very
        difficult pull. Go back up the ramp out of the Efreeti pit and into the
        room with the table. Take the door to your right (the one you haven’t
        used yet). You’ll come into a room with 2 more Goblins and a fireplace
        in it. This is a pretty good place to set up base camp. Kindle will
        wander right through this room and you’re close enough to pull from
        the Captain’s room and the Efreeti pit. There’s another door on the
        other side of the fireplace. Take that door, you’re now in a short
        hall. Open the door at the end you will see a room with 3 doors, there
        are 2 goblins guarding the middle door. This is the Captain’s room.
        Pulling is difficult because you can’t pull only those 2. When you
        pull either of them, you will pull 2-4 more. 2 or 3 from the Captain’s
        room plus there’s usually a lurker behind the left door who will come,
        too. So now you have to fight 5 or 6 goblins. During the fight one of
        the of the spawns in the fireplace rooms will pop up and sometimes
        kindle (or his placeholder) will wander in. Compound that with the
        Goblins proclivity to run and you have all the makings for a disaster.
        Think: ENCHANTER or BARD… Once you’ve broken the spawn it’s much
        easier of course. It’s worth it because the Captain drops two very
        nice items: Charred Boots are common (AC6 +3 AGI +5 vs Fire and Poison)
        and Charred Gauntlets (AC7 +3 DEX +5 INT) rare. When you consider how
        few good gloves and boots there are (I got my snakeskin gloves at level
        10) then you’ll realize how truly special the Captain is.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">By my count, for gloves there are 4 choices after
        snakeskin: plate (steel or bronze), Charred, Ro or Darkmail. Boots are
        worse, plate, Dwarven workboots or Ro. Considering that he ALWAYS drops
        boots or gloves and that a party in their high 20’s to low 30’s I
        don’t understand why he isn’t camped far more often. I was offered
        2000pp in trade for my gloves (2 foreman tunic –800, 2 kobold boots
        -400, 2 obsidian hoops -500 and chitin greaves-300).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I have not met anyone who has seen charred
        leggings or charred bracers. Ferrick reported that he had heard rumors
        that they were available. It would be fairly sweet to find.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">MINING MELATITE</font></b><font face="Arial">:<i> </i>Now
        the question all the Paladins (and Shadowknights and Rangers to a lesser
        degree) will want answered: what drops Melatite? I have been told models
        MB, MC, and XC, XB and the minors drop Melatite. No one seems to know.
        The best answer is to kill as many employees and mechanicals of the
        Solusek Mining Company as possible (verant really doesn’t want us to
        roleplay do they?). It’s very rare, so don’t expect to get much.
        Camping Gabbie, Captain and the EXG while trying to get Melatite makes
        the most sense. A few things to note. I have heard rumors that melatite
        drops more often outside the Castle proper (near the
        &quot;L-bridge&quot; but I have my doubts. Also, killing the gnomish
        minors gives you a much bigger faction hit than killing the mechanicals.
        I would avoid killing the minors and conjurers if I could<i>.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">To get to the Gnome Castle and find Melatite.
        Backtracking to the L-bridge, go over the bridge and continue on,
        you’ll come to a swinging pendulum (its only for looks, it won’t
        actually hurt you). Keep going and you will come to a larger room with a
        large pool of lava. Follow the path to the left and you will see the
        Castle. You will have to jump into and swim (you’re given a waiver for
        rule # 6 this one time) a very small section of lava. If you do this
        quickly you won’t even take the usual 40 points of lava damage. It’s
        not really dangerous, but it’s fun to watch people do for the first
        time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">After you negotiate the lava (the first time
        you’ll be breathing kinda hard, but it wasn’t that bad, was it?) you
        will come to two drawbridges. The one on the right is the one we want.
        The left leads you to the doorway back by the secret door that leads to
        the Goblin Foreman room. I have not met anyone who has found anything
        particularly noteworthy on this side of the Castle.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Inside the castle is essentially one long hallway.
        Follow the hall until you come to a set of steps going down. Keep
        walking (well run – does anyone walk in Norrath?) we’ll come back
        later. Eventually the hall dead-ends at an opening with some lava.
        Across which you can see another drawbridge. There is a secret room
        (closet more like) with a lever a little bit behind you. It’s hard to
        see, just turn around and run along the right wall and you will run into
        it. Over the drawbridge are more Gnomes and their mechanical friends.
        It’s a hard place to describe and I’m not going to try. There are 4
        secret doors in this area. They all lead to the same room. Inside there
        are 6 Gnomes, one of them is a wanderer. The wandering Gnome is the
        placeholder for <b>the Lava Elemental</b> (drops the Runed Lava Pendant,
        5AC +5Str +5 Fire, I’ve been told his common drop is a healing potion,
        I have yet to confirm this). This room is tough. When you attack any of
        the gnomes they will all attack you. I think they will attack you if you
        attack the Lava Elemental (I think he’s aggro). I’ve been told level
        50 players get experience from the Elemental, so beware. The Runed Lava
        Pendant is pretty darn nice.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Going back down the hall to the stairs, go down.
        At the bottom you will find a button and a door. To open the door you
        push the button. It locks behind you so don’t go in unless you want
        to. You go through a hall, a door and are in a small courtyard with a
        reddish tint. There is a secret room in here with a button on the wall.
        It opens the door that locked behind you… When you leave the courtyard
        you now find yourself in a small hallway with 2 doors and a portcullis.
        The first door has the Gnomish Vendor. He sells the Bag of the Tinkerers.
        It sells for around between 5250 and 7000pp. Buy me one, OK? I use him
        to sell FS and other goodies. People in Sol B use him too. I have found
        some very nice items for sale here (like medium Bronze Tunics and a
        Savant Cap.) Buying an item is a good way to get rid of excess copper
        silver and gold. Or you can just leave monk droppings all over the
        place, but I hate a messy dungeon. If only he sold food and drink (the
        gypsy camp in Lava Storm is the closest place I know for that). When he
        stops selling to you it’s time to go back to Sol B and whack Kobolds.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The next door is where <b>Gabbie Mardoddle</b>
        spawns. Gabbie’s rare drop is the uber-rare, Molten Cloak (4AC +4 WIS
        and INT – watch the spell-casters drool). Gabbie’s common drop is
        the Mithril Quill, a 4 dmg 19 dly +20 HP piercing weapon (wow! /em
        dripping sarcasm). She spawns behind the desk. Gabbie is a caster and
        can do a TON of damage in a small amount of time. There are 2 other
        Gnomes in the room with her. They will attack when you start attacking
        Gabbie (or the place-holder) so be prepared for a fight. If she has the
        quill you will see it. It looks like a dagger… <b>Captain Bipnipple</b>,
        or his place-holder, will wander in and stand next to Gabbie. He’ll
        join in the fray as well, so I advice you kill him first. You can find a
        few spots to fight him while he’s alone fairly easily (like the
        courtyard with the reddish tint) if you follow him. Captain Bipnipple
        drops the Gnomish Environmental suit (not sure what the other drop is).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">There’s one more NPC to camp while your mining
        for Melatite: the <b>Clockwork Model EXG</b>. She drops the Charred
        Guardian Shield (10AC +9 WIS – druids and clerics love it) as her
        common drop and the Charred Guardian Breastplate (16AC +3 STR +6 STA -
        LORE ITEM – looks great too) is the rare drop (which is fine since the
        shield is so much more valuable). The EXG is a large female mechanical.
        You can see the shield if she has it. To find her go through the
        portcullis outside Gabbie’s room. You are in a big courtyard at the
        front of the Castle, now. There’s only one path, follow it. Continue
        cross two bridges (more lava). After the second bridge you’ll come to
        a small room with 2 mechanicals. The EXG wanders between the portcullis
        this room (she and her place-holders are the only employees that wander
        in this area). She’s very touch to kill, being 100% resistant to magic
        (you can cast cancel magic on her). Nearby Gnomish Conjurer’s will
        buff and heal her, so find a nice secluded place to fight and tell your
        casters to med. I’ve killed her twice, a couple of healers and a
        couple of tanks can take her down around level 30. Like most of the mobs
        in Sol A she has a 20 minute spawn cycle and has place holders (the ones
        that wander along her path).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">This is the end of the Gnome area. Continuing past
        that room with 2 gnome mechanicals that the EXG wanders to and you’ll
        go up some stairs (it turns left) and eventually the hall will end. You
        have to take a left or right here. (if you look to your right you will
        see some nasty looking spikes (like the swinging pendulum it doesn’t
        hurt, it’s just for looks) you will also see Goblins again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">If you take the right, towards the there is a
        doorway to your left BEFORE you get to the spikes, TAKE IT. If you
        continue on there are two traps past the spikes that drop you into the
        pit with the blazing elementals and the Reckless Efreeti. I only had to
        do that once to learn, I never go past the spikes now. You will find
        yourself on a ledge with a door and a single goblin. This is the
        door/ledge that leads to the Reckless Efreeti (the one you find Singe on
        a lot).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Well that’s a full circle. Time to go explore
        the Goblin Stronghold.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">THE STRONGHOLD</font></b><font face="Arial">: OK,
        you’ve explored the rest of the Goblin areas around the castle.
        You’ve gotten a few good items (probably a Foreman’s tunics at
        least) and you’re ready to go fight the Goblins on their home ground.
        Be warned the goblins in the Stronghold are tougher. There are very few
        Youngs and Cinders. If you venture in far enough you will see Solusek
        Goblins, and these guys are nasty, especially the casters. So, go back
        to the ledge. In front of you is a small pit-like area. Take the stairs
        or jump down. The door in front of you is the entrance to the
        Stronghold. Enter and you will be in a short hall with a door at the
        end. Go through and you will find yourself in a room with a portcullis
        there are 4 goblins in here, 2 near the door and 2 behind the
        portcullis. You will usually have to fight all 4 in the same pull. After
        the portcullis there are 2 doors, one on the left and one on the right.
        Take the left one. (if you find a secret door that leads back to the
        ledge, turn around, I didn’t mean that one, you have to go through the
        portcullis before you take the left).</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">Drunkedness in the Stronghold: </font></b><font face="Arial">I
        had never heard that Goblins were big drinkers… The bar is very
        popular with players, certainly. The <b>Goblin Bartender</b> drops
        Drakeskin arms (rare) and Drakeskin leggings (Enchanters love the
        leggings: AC5 +5 DEX +5 CHA). Getting there is a bit of risk. Go
        straight you will go up some stairs and eventually come to a door. The
        bar is behind that door. There will be several goblins on the stairs
        getting to the bar. I always pull them back to the portcullis room. When
        you get to bar there are 3 goblins there. The bartender spawns behind
        the bar (gasp!). There are two rooms off of the bar. The one to the left
        (when you enter the bar) is a storeroom. There are 3 goblins here. To
        the right there is another room with 2 small rooms adjoining it. These
        rooms have pallets and appear to be where the goblins go to sleep it
        off. One of these side rooms is where the <b>Goblin Drunkard </b>spawns.
        I think it’s the room in the back. I cannot confirm this, as I have
        never seen the Drunkard. Close by is the <b>High Goblin Shaman. </b>I
        understand that he drops the (Glowing Stone Band: +2 AC. Serpent Sight)
        as his common drop. Considering all the people who are up in arms about
        the loss of DE vision with the loss of the Mask of the Deceiver I am
        very surprised that this item in not more heavily camped. Being a Dwarf
        I have no basis of comparison here. But if you want infravision here it
        is. His other drop I have been told is a Platinum Totem. No idea what it
        does.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Finding the high shaman is not easy. Much of the
        Stronghold is maze of confusing turns and corridors. I’ll try and give
        directions, but don’t blame me if you get lost. Starting at the
        portcullis in the Goblin Stronghold, go through and take the door on
        left (towards the bar). Halfway up stairs, turn right and go through
        that door. There are 2 spawns in this room. Take the door ahead of you
        (not the one on the right). Follow the hall, it turns left. At the end
        of hall, past one door on right with one gob in, turn right. Go all way
        to end of hall (there are two rooms in this hall with one spawn in
        each), at the end of hall there should be a red devil head. The door on
        right of head opens into a room with 1 goblin. There is 1 door leading
        out of this room, to a corridor, there’s 1 door directly opposite.
        Down and to the left there's a door. This goes into a small room with
        lots of books around the wall. There are 3 spawn points to the left of
        the door. This is the Shaman’s room.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">*** QUEST INFO *** There is a new NPC in Sol A, <b>Lynada</b>,
        a Dark Elf mage. She may, or may not, have replaced the Shaman.
        Apparently she is part of some new quest (drops the sparkle-purse that <b>Kizdean
        Gix</b> in West Commons used to have). You can hear her casting when
        you’re at the bar. If you figure out what the sparkle purse is for let
        us know, it appears to be part of a paladin quest (dare I say it… No,
        won’t jinx it). Why do I think it is part of a paladin’s quest?
        Because of the appearance of the &quot;Sparkling Saphire&quot; – NO
        DROP - LORE - PAL ONLY All races – at <b>Noresa Sparkle’s</b>, a gem
        merchant in West Commons… Lynada is in the center of this room I have
        been told. She is around level 28-32.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Back to the portcullis, if you take the right door
        the hall turns left. There is a secret door here and you can continue
        forward. It doesn’t matter which way you go, straight or left, both
        eventually lead you to the Goblin King. If you go through the secret
        door you take a left and go down a long hall and come to a door. Open
        the door and you will be in a small chamber with 2 others doors. The one
        on your left leads to a small bedroom, the other leads to the throne
        room. Surprisingly the <b>Goblin King </b>spawns in the bedroom. His
        majesty commonly drops the Ring of the Goblin Lords (AC4 +3 Int +3 Str).
        His rare drop is the Scepter of Flame (Damage 7, Delay 29, +15 Mana, +5
        Fire and Magic), a nice weapon, but I was hoping for better. If you
        don’t use the secret door (meaning you took a left) you will go down a
        shorter hall. There’s a room on your left with the Goblin Merchant in
        it. He doesn’t drop anything memorable, but if you have good faction
        or can sneak you can sell to him (he sells water and bandages as well).
        A little farther the hall ends and you have 2 doors, left or right. The
        King is beyond the right one. You will go through a small room with 2
        goblins first and you’ll be back in the throne room.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Back out of the throne room and go to the hall
        with 2 doors (you took the right door). If you take the left door and
        then continue to your right (there’s a door there soon see some some
        jail cells. At the end of the hall there’s a door (not a cell), inside
        you will find the <b>Inferno Goblin Torturer</b>. The few times I hunted
        him he dropped a Turquoise Eyepatch (+2 Str +2 Int +2 Cha) which isn’t
        that wonderful for melee types, but enchanters seem to like them. Since
        I’ve never seen him drop anything else, I have to assume this is his
        common drops . I have yet to meet anyone who knows what the rare drop
        is… I plan to find out soon.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">There is a zone to Sol B in the stronghold, but
        it’s fairly deep and as I’ve said navigating in the stronghold is
        pretty difficult, so I’m not going to try to lead you there.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font face="Arial">STRATEGY</font></b><font face="Arial">: Solusek A
        is a great place for both loot and experience. If it is experience you
        crave, I would suggest you head to the Stronghold as soon as possible.
        The loot is not as great, (you’ll still get mad amounts of Fine Steal,
        just not as many rare items). I have seen some people get crazy
        experience there. Start in the portucullis room and pull nearby goblins.
        Once you find you can handle that move on to the bar. After that it’s
        time to tackle the Solusek Goblins and the Goblin King. A small
        well-organized group can utilize the secret hall and camp the Goblin
        king fairly easily. Larger groups should camp the Throne room and pull
        there (IMHO).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">There is less experience to be had on the other
        side of the dungeon, but I think the great loot and fun is well worth
        it. I started on the stairs (bad idea – which I document – see rules
        #3, #1, #2 and #6) and quickly moved to the goblins on the ledge
        (pulling them to the Sol B room). When I could get good groups together
        we would move on to the Predator/Foreman rooms. (I have made several
        camps of the bar, but I find those groups have to be much more
        disciplined.) When that became easy we moved into the Reckless Efreeti
        area. I found I was able to successfully solo the ledge goblins around
        level 25 and the Predator room around level 30. I still have trouble
        with soloing the Foreman room.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A good group can camp the room above the Efreeti
        pit, pulling the Efreeti, the Goblin Captain room and several
        surrounding rooms as well. Be forewarned pulling the Captain’s room
        usually results in 4 or 5 goblins (inferno’s and fires).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">At 31 I have several options. I can solo the
        Predator/Foreman rooms. I can get a group to fight in the
        Captain/Kindle/Efreeti/Singe area. With a good group I can mine for
        melatite among the gnomes. I do this by alternating between Gabbie and
        the EXG. Or I can go after the Throne room and hunt Solusek Goblins. The
        bar is another choice.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Well, that pretty much covers the whole place.
        Good hunting and if you find some charred leggings or bracers post
        something on the Paladin’s of Norrath and tell us how. Also, if you
        out anything more about <b>Lynada </b>let us know.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Another thing to note about the High shaman
        room, is that the table blocks Line of Sight. So you can go into one
        corner (to the left of the high shaman), and neither Lynada or the other
        spawn in the room can see you… You can do the same thing in the bar.
        If you fight the bartender behind the bar, the other mobs will not
        assist (unless he moves past the end of the bar).&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">I would like to thank Ferrik Bloodforge of Cazic
        Thule. I found his guide to Solusek A, posted on the EQ Clerics (http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/).
        Armed with his knowledge I ventured there and have never regretted one
        minute.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I would also like to thank all the Paladins of
        Norrath, their insights, comments and experiences have helped me
        immeasurably in the writing of this guide.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I have had many friends who have joined me in my
        journeys through Solusek A. There are so many of you I couldn’t
        possibly mention you all. But I would like to single out Mordantyr,
        Mecbeth, Excaliber, Merrek and all my brothers and sisters in the
        Vigilantes, thanks for the help.</font>
