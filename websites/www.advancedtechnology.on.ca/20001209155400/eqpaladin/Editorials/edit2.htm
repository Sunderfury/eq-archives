        <p align="center"><font face="Arial">Roleplaying a Paladin</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I was thinking the other day about Everquest and
        the role that Paladins play in the land of Norrath. After a few minutes
        of research, looking at the descriptions of all the gods, what they
        stand for and finding out which ones can have warriors (Paladins)
        dedicated to them, I have reached a few conclusions.</font>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial">Most of us in Everquest do not have the same
            Idea of what a Paladin is. Lets get a good definition of exactly
            what a Paladin is. We can go from there. This is what Verant has to
            say: &quot; Paladins are the very picture of a holy knight, fighting
            for the cause of good in all aspects of his life. They share some of
            the power of a Cleric, and a good deal of the fighting ability of a
            Warrior, but have a few powers all their own. &quot;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">Not all Paladins are after the same thing. The
            thought that all paladins are always kind, compassionate
            Warrior-Priests is just dead wrong in the land of Norrath. Lets take
            a few of the gods and see what their main goals are. This will give
            us some insight to how their chosen Warriors-Priests would react.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>BRELL</i><font SIZE="+1">:</font></b> &quot;<b>Followers
        of Brell Serilis believe that the surface world is a waste of space.
        They find true happiness in the caves,caverns and tunnels that perforate
        the belly of Norrath. But this is one of few points that all followers
        of Brell can agree upon. There are many different factions who all
        worship Brell. The Runny Eye Clan of Goblins claim he is their father
        much to the disgust of the Dwarves of Kaladim, who know that the Dwarves
        are the true children of Serilis. But the vicious Gnolls of Split Paw
        disagree entirely. For was it not Brell who sculpted them out of the
        sacred Clay of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis in one form or
        another can be found nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot of Norrath.</b>&quot;
        Does this mean that followers of Brell would be very concerned about
        surface dwellers? I think not. Brell's &quot;true&quot; children, his
        &quot;Holy Warriors&quot; would be focused on ridding the world of those
        bastard-children, ie Goblins, Gnolls and other assorted evil ground
        dwellers. Their clerical nature would make any undead abhorent but it
        would not make them &quot; loving and compassionate &quot; toward
        anybody except maybe other dwarves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>EROLLISI MARR</i></b>: Followers of Erollisi
        Marr cling to the belief that love conquers all. It should be pointed
        out that while love is a generally peaceful concept, Erollisi
        worshippers are not pacifists. They would like to live in a world where
        everyone loves everyone else and violence does not exist but they are
        not naïve enough to think that Norrath is that world. They have
        passionate loves of people, places and ideas and are more than willing
        to fight and die to preserve those things. The dream of every follower
        of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or something they
        love. Many Paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and follow
        Erollisi Marr. &quot;<b>Erollisi Marr, ahh.. the lover of all.</b>&quot;
        If you must play a Paladin who is kind and compassionate toward all,
        then this is the goddess to follow. And, you can even make it more fun
        by having compassion toward the undead. By relieving them of their pain
        ( ie: destroying them ). The followers of Erollisi Marr would be the
        ONLY paladins who would have compassion for the evil races/classes. This
        is because of the underlying belief that &quot;Love conquers all.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>KARANA</i></b>: &quot;<b>Followers of Karana
        believe in the absolute power of storms. They worship the life giving
        power of the rain and respect the destructive force of a sandstorm or
        hurricane. Typical followers of Karana are rural humanoids, farmers,
        ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer shelter from the
        elements to strangers. Many Karana followers live a nomadic lifestyle,
        travelling where the winds take them. They are humble, generous people
        who value strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana and his
        work for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all
        of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.</b>&quot; Followers of
        Karana would tend to be awestruck and humbled at the power of the
        storms. They would help the traveler as needed. They would have the
        typical abhorance of undead. These Paladins would have a lot in common
        with Rangers in their reverence of nature. Because they value strength
        and honesty, they would in retrospect be angered by those who live a
        lifestyle of dishonesty and pride. Weakness, because of limitations, is
        understood but weakness such as cowardice or brashness (two forms of the
        same weakness) would be looked upon as distasteful at best.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>MITHANIEL MARR</i></b>: &quot;<b>The
        Followers of Mithaniel Marr believe that valour is what separates
        civilized beings from beasts. His followers live by a strict moral code
        that prizes truth, honor, and charity. They are champions of the
        downtrodden and the most noble of warriors. His followers strive to rid
        Norrath of all things dark and evil, often sacrificing themselves in
        this never ending quest. They will not rest until the day when all of
        Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel's light.</b>&quot; They take themselves
        and their duty very seriously, and have little patience for mischief or
        mayhem. Many Paladins are devout servants of Mithaniel Marr. Followers
        of Mithaniel Marr are the most ruthless when it comes to battling those
        forces of evil known as Ogres, Trolls and Dark Elves as well as the
        Necromancers and Shadowknights that plauge the land. They are utterly
        ruthless when dealing with those types. They would be compassionate IF
        and only IF one of the evil races was trying to be good, but NEVER with
        one who has chosen the dark path of Necromancy or Shadowknight.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>PREXUS</i></b>: &quot;<b>Followers of Prexus
        believe true power lies in the vast depths of Norrath's oceans. They
        believe that eons ago life first formed in the murky deep and that one
        day the oceans shall rise again to consume those who are unworthy and to
        embrace the faithful. The Oceanlord's servants tend to live and work
        near, on, or beneath large bodies of water. They seek to spread the word
        of Prexus to all who will hear and defend the oceans and seas of Norrath
        against any who would cause them harm. Many sailors and fishermen are
        followers of Prexus.</b>&quot; Not much is really known about how the
        followers of Prexus would react to anything except to say that they
        would be very upset with any who would foul the waters of Norrath. This
        includes all the inland waters also. (thus their hatred of Necromancers,
        Shadowknights, Goblins and other evil creatures.) Currently there are
        not many things to do underwater, but the followers of Prexus would be
        against the defiling of the oceans. They as Paladins would still have
        the total abhorance of all things undead.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>TUNARE</i></b>: &quot;<b>Followers of Tunare
        believe that we are all Tunare's children. The children of Tunare seek
        to help Norrath, which they believe to be a living and breathing Being,
        to blossom and grow. Followers believe that the world of Norrath gave
        birth to Tunare and from her all life has sprung forth. Thus, by
        worshipping and protecting the land, followers are paying homage and
        respect to The Mother of Their Mother, who in turn protects and provides
        for them. Followers of Tunare will fight to the death to protect nature
        in all it's forms.</b>&quot; Many Druids, Rangers, and a great many
        Elves follow the ways of Tunare. Followers of Tunare would have a fine
        line to walk when it comes to being compassionate yet still caretakers
        of the land. They should be compassionate to all who ask for compassion
        but they would be very fierce in their protection of those
        people/creatures who would defile the land with evil and cause the land
        to stop growing. When it comes to necromancers and Shadowknights, the
        paladins of Tunare would be fanatical in their dislike/hatred. They
        would want to destroy anything that fouls the land.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">To me, this shows that all paladins have some
        common belief's but not all. For instance where Paladins of Erollisi
        could love their enemies and have compassion for all, no other Paladin
        society would feel that way. All the other Paladin societies would feel
        that not only is it their Duty, but their Honor as well to fight and
        kill any and all Evil. This includes ShadowKnights and Necromancers of
        all races.</font></p>
