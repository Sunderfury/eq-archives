        :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>Kalatrina Plossen is one of the greatest
        Paladins in the Land. Her duty is to train new, young knights and keep
        an eye on the Hated Freeport Militia. She can be found at the Hall of
        Truth in North Freeport. She is directly above the entrance on the
        second floor. When you Hail her, she informs you she has need of young
        knights. After further investigation, you learn of a spy within the
        Militia. He is in danger and Kalatrina hands you a note to give to him.
        He can be found in the Freeport Militia House.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter
        2 :</font> </font></b>The beginnings of your Quest! Rush over to the
        Militia House. The spy is in the middle of the Militia House in the
        Courtyard on the first floor. You give him the code and he warns you of
        danger. You hand him the note. Suddenly, Militia swarm to the spy and
        begin attacking him! He hands you an old piece of burned parchment and
        yells to return to the Hall of Truth. He falls to the Evil Guards. Run
        to the Hall of Truth! Upon further inspection of the note you read:&nbsp;Zimel's
        Blades with some prices. Give the note to Kalatrina.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter
        3 :</font> </font></b>Kalatrina is excited by the note you have been
        given. DO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;give Kalatrina Plossen the Note. If you do,
        restart the Quest and get it again. This is where the Quest is
        counter-intuitive. If you give her the Note, she tells you Zimel was a
        great Blacksmith who knew the secret of enchanting blades and making
        superior weapons. This is a bug in the Quest.&nbsp; Do NOT give her the
        note and carry it with you.&nbsp; She tells you to go and talk to
        Rashinda Elore at the Office of the People. Rashinda is difficult to get
        any information out of but once you do, you determine that Groflah
        Steadirt of Groflah's Forge, was a friend of Zimel's and may have more
        information. When you ask Rashinda of Zimel's Blades, Lakeen Boorheez
        wanders in, saying he is lost. He quickly exits and heads to the
        tunnels.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 4
        :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>Run over to Groflah's Forge and ask him about
        Zimel. He is on the second floor of the Forge and is not very helpful.
        He is nervous when you ask him of Zimel and tells you he will not speak
        here. Hand Groflah the Note you received from the Spy. Groflah tells you
        many things and asks you to meet him at the Seafarer's Roost. He can
        study the Note and try to decode the information. Groflah hands you the
        Note back.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1" color="#808000">Chapter 5 :&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</b>Wandering
        over to the Seafarer's Roost, buy a drink, relax and watch Freeport go
        about its business. Groflah SHOULD&nbsp;show up between 1am and 3am.
        When he arrives, ask who Zimel is. He will go into a long story about
        how Zimel has disappeared and the Blade, Soulfire has been lost. Hand
        Groflah the Note and he attempt to decipher it. Groflah tells you that
        he thinks Sir Lucan D'Lere, Head of the Freeport Militia, and Pietro
        Zarn, Head of the ShadowKnight Guild in Freeport are in cahoots and
        searching for Soulfire as well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1" color="#808000">Chapter 6 :</font>
        </b>Thanking him for his knowledge, look about the Seafarer's Roost. Who
        is wandering around? A&nbsp;beggar named Tykar Renlin should be close
        by. Asking Tykar for information about Zimel, Tykar responds by saying
        he is thirsty. Purchase a Drom's Champagne from the Bartender and give
        one to Tykar. Repeat this three more times. Tykar informs you that Zimel
        has been thrown into Prison by the Militia near the Arena. Feeling
        guilty, Tykar hands you a blanket to give to Zimel if you should meet
        him.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 7
        :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>Alas! It is true! Zimel is locked in a cell and
        has been driven crazy. After asking Zimel various Questions, he responds
        by saying he wants some items. After deciphering his unintelligible
        speech, you determine he wants Bog Juice, Edible Goo and a Blanket.
        Well, Tykar gave you the Blanket. You have seen Edible Goo in the
        various Bakeries and know it is the most basic of delicacies. Bog Juice,
        wait! You know a Brewer who has the recipe and seem to recall even
        drinking some before! Hand each of these items to Zimel. Zimel will give
        you a key simply marked H.K.102</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 8
        :</font> </font></b>H.K.102? 'tis a Chest key. Ah! In Highhold Pass,
        Humans have built a bank there to guard their riches from the barbaric
        Orcs and Gnolls. Visit the bank in Highhold Pass and hand the Bank Clerk
        the key. She thanks you for the key and hands you a Note to deliver to
        Brother Hayle. Alas, she is certain he is being held captive in a cell
        in Splitpaw, a Gnoll stronghold.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1" color="#808000">Chapter 9 : </font></b>Journeying
        into Splitpaw, you find Brother Hayle and hand him the Note. Brother
        Hayle hands you the Note once again and asks you to retrieve a number of
        items for him. He would like you to prove your nobility to him. He asks
        you to bring the Hilt of Soulfire back to him. The Hilt is being held by
        an Evil ShadowKnight named Xicotl in MistMoore Castle! As well, bring
        him the Brilliant Sword of Faith(Quest info <a HREF="../bsof.htm">here</a>).
        Finally, he asks you to bring your Testimony(Quest info <a HREF="../truth.htm">here</a>).</font></p>
