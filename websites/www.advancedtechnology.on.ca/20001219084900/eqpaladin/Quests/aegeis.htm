        :</font>&nbsp;</b></font>Searching the lands, acquiring fame, fortune
      and might, you wander the streets of Qeynos.&nbsp; You are aware of a Lord
      Grimrot, wandering the Plains of Karana, killing people and using great
      magics to transform himself, you know he must be stopped and have gone
      into Qeynos to seek more information.&nbsp; You find yourself at the
      &quot;UFO&quot; and decide to visit (Paladin).&nbsp; He seems troubled
      when you find him.&nbsp;&nbsp; You ask him of Lord Grimrot and he
      begins...</font></p>
      <p><font color="#808000"><b><font SIZE="+1">Chapter 2
        : </font></b></font><font face="Arial">He tells you of Grimrot's evil
      deeds and how he must be destroyed.&nbsp; Lord Grimrot has 2 forms.&nbsp;
      Even though you may kill his human self, which has been done before, he
      comes back and wanders the land as a skeleton!&nbsp; You must destroy
      Grimrot in both of his forms and return his decayed heart, and a scythe(NO
      DROP).&nbsp; Once you return these items, the people of Qeynos will gift
      you with a symbol of your Goodness!&nbsp; The Aegeis of Life shall be
      yours.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#808000"><b><font SIZE="+1">Chapter 3
        : </font></b></font><font face="Arial">You set out from Qeynos, the
      citizens granting you gifts of flowers and food.&nbsp; You wander a day
      and night through the Western Plains and through the Northern
      Plains.&nbsp; You finally reach the river and find the great stone bridge
      that will bring you to the Southern Plains of Karana.&nbsp; Guards at the
      stone bridge tell you of Lord Grimrot and know he appears near them every
      once in a while, casting magics on the Guards and scaring them to
      death.&nbsp; You cross the bridge and climb a hill to the west, watching
      the lands, searching for Lord Grimrot.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#808000"><b><font SIZE="+1">Chapter 4
        : </font></b></font><font face="Arial">After what seems AGES, you notice
      Lord Grimrot lurking along the shores, kneeling along the waters and
      fishing.&nbsp; You approach Lord Grimrot and draw your Blade.&nbsp; Lord
      Grimrot stands, drops his pole and unsheaths a great Scythe!&nbsp; &quot;A
      pity one such as thee shall fall to thy doom!&quot; And with that battle
      ensues!&nbsp; A long and hardened fight, Lord Grimrot finally falls to a
      blow that shatters his Scythe and kills him outright.&nbsp; You pull the
      Scythe from his deadened hands and sit down to nurse your wounds.&nbsp; A
      short time later you look to the shore and find that Lord Grimrot's corpse
      is gone!&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#808000"><b><font SIZE="+1">Chapter 5
        : </font></b></font><font face="Arial">You make camp for the night to
      rest up before continuing your search.&nbsp; Late that night, you hear a
      clicking in the darkness and stand up, pulling your blade from its
      sheath.&nbsp; You begin to smell a vile, putrid stench.&nbsp; As you peer
      into the trees, a skeleton, dressed in Lord Grimrot's jacket slinks
      towards you.&nbsp; You can see his heart, black and shrunken, dripping a
      blackened juice that oozes his spirit and soul.&nbsp; You call upon the
      might of Marr and Ward his attacks, swinging Ghoulbane and bashing with
      your Shield.&nbsp; The skeleton puts up a good fight, but in the end, no
      Undead can truly harm you!&nbsp; You pull the skeletons heart out from its
      broken ribcage and watch it disintegrate before your eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; You
      stumble into the Guard Towers and sleep the rest of the night.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#808000"><b><font SIZE="+1">Chapter 6
        : </font></b></font><font face="Arial">The Guards make you a hearty
      breakfast in the morning and set out for Qeynos the moment you are ready.&nbsp;
        You arrive back in Qeynos and news travelled fast ahead of you.&nbsp;
        (Paladin) was waiting for your arrival.&nbsp; You hand him the Heart and
        Scythe of Lord Grimrot, triumphant and pleased.&nbsp; (Paladin) hands
        you a Golden Encrusted Shield, naming it the Aegeis of Life.&nbsp; You
        strap the Shield to your back and thank him profusely.&nbsp; Wassail!</font></p>

        : </font></b></font><font face="Arial">The faction requirements for this
        Quest are right off the maps.&nbsp; Even at amiable faction, if you are
        not maxed out with faction, you will have to find and kill Grimrot all
        over again.&nbsp; There are a number of ways to restore faction.&nbsp;
        Here is Snowxan's comments and what he did to gain the proper faction:</font></p>

              <td width="100%"><font face="Arial"> The only way I found you can get a
      reasonable amount of faction (and a nice percentage of loot, i made about 150pp
      in one run) is the bandit sash quest. I fill up 5 full backpacks about
      12 times before my faction was amiable with the Temple of Life... and I THOUGHT
      that I could turn in the scythe and heart to the head paladin in Qeynos... I
      was WRONG! Then I had to go out and kill Grimrot again with a few friends
      of mine. This takes a LONG time to complete, but well worth it.</font></td>
