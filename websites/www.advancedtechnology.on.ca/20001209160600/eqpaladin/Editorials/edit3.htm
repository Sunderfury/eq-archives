        <p align="center"></b></font><font face="Arial">&nbsp;Here is a string
        of thoughts that I&nbsp;feel would improve EverQuest. Remember, only an
        opinion, but these points would keep me playing the game longer. This is
        a Post I wrote to my Companions. We have a message board that we speak
        to each other on, and I&nbsp;have decided to share it with all of you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Posted by <strong>Varrus Aurelius</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial">Well, last night
        we all logged in and played in Lower Guk. Shaq sent a tell, telling me
        she was in the Lord Rooms and there was no one there! I got my WHOLE
        party up there and ran into Xezax once again. Shaq never saw him, but
        that isn't the point. Xezax is a great and very friendly guy. The
        problem is, he sat in that Lord Room from Friday night to Sunday night.
        He gave me a bracer(like I said, a great guy) and we talked about the
        Lord and camping and such. Since Friday, 4 Paladins that wandered into
        the Lord room all sent me tells saying not to bother. 2 of them were
        40+, no Ghoulbane. I just didn't have the heart to play, and logged a
        little early. If people's days are numbered in EQ, I figure mine shrunk
        a fair bit this weekend.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">On a side note, I have one piece of advice to
        give. DO NOT play TFC on a shared 33.6 with a mild headache. :-) I think
        my worse score was 9/26. Zube and Baba were running around everywhere,
        talking, fighting, winning. I just couldn't keep up. My brain was
        pounding and trying to outsnipe a guy with 150 ping is nuts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I am going to send an email to Verant, just to ask
        a few questions and give a few pointers. :-) This is the general gist of
        my problem. Drop a comment?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Example 1 : Every class has a defining set of
        equipment or Quest that involves themselves with their class somehow. A
        good example is Warriors and the Centaurs of SK. A Warrior could
        traverse the WHOLE world getting the various components they require to
        complete their Quest. Once they have completed their Quest, they have a
        complete set of Warrior only, crafted armour. That is a brilliant idea
        that is the perfect Quest. There is only one problem. Let's take the
        Helm for example. The Goblin Fire Totem is NO DROP. Perfect. The Ruby is
        not. Great, half of the Quest is NO DROP. That is fine. You travel all
        of the way to South Karana, give the Centaur a Totem and two rubies.
        Tada! You are given a helm. A nice, pretty Crafted Helm. YOU worked for
        it, YOU get it. But wait, it is a regular item? That is right, the Helm
        you just received can be sold by any class to anyone that wants it.
        Although Warriors can use it, anyone can sell it. Crafted armour IS a
        defining piece of equipment for Warriors. Should a Warrior be able to
        buy HIS/HER crafted armour at the bank in Freeport? NO! ALL crafted
        armour should be NO TRADE, NO DROP.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Example 2 : Here is one near and dear to my heart.
        I am a Paladin. :-) I have heard of a sword that is within the bowels of
        Guk that would aid my cause of ridding the land of evil. An Evil Froggie
        Paladin(Let's not go there, hehe) wields a sword so great, the undead
        crumple at its swing. I fight my way up to level 30, feeling I have
        reached my best chance of getting it so far. We fight to the Shin Lord's
        rooms and Lo and Behold! A player is already there. A HIGH level player
        who is VERY nice and has stayed in that room for almost 3 days. He talks
        with us, is very friendly and tells us he is a Cleric. Pardon? Why would
        a Cleric want Ghoulbane? Well, his friend was up all night camping for
        it, but now had to sleep so he is camping for him. I have FINALLY
        reached level 30, 30 levels wanting to fight for a Paladin Sword. Don't
        hand it to me on a platter, I want to fight for it. How can I fight for
        something that now NEVER appears? And if it does, there were 6 lvl 40+
        Paladin IN Upper Guk, hanging around, waiting for their turn? Shouldn't
        a level 40 Pally be working for the BSOF or Soulfire? Everyone talks of
        Verant making rare drops INCREDIBLY rare now. So now, after the 12 of my
        friends and I have fought together, won together, lost together, can
        finally come together to maybe help me get a blade that would help
        define my character. I am the only Paladin in our peer group. We don't
        really care what the rest of the world has. OUR group would like to
        Quest together, to gain things that would make us better, heroic, etc
        etc. Ghoulbane is my goal. If we had a Warrior, we would have no doubt
        just finished crossing the whole world getting Crafted Armour. BUT, that
        Warrior would've been there, handing in the parts and getting the armour,
        deserving every bit, bringing us closer as a group. NO DROP, NO TRADE.
        MAKE Ghoulbane and any similar weapon NO DROP NO TRADE. That would solve
        a large part of EverQuests problems. ONLY Paladins could be there,
        slaying the Shin Lord, with their friends backing them up. Yes, it took
        me a while to get to level 30, and yes, far too many Paladins before me
        may have won Ghoulbane through combat or EBay, but what do they matter
        to me or my friends? What purpose do we have if our reason for
        &quot;Questing&quot; is gone?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Good things : The Fire Totem in Sol A is NO DROP.
        Perfect, I assume all of the other Crafted Armour components are as
        well. Why would Crafted Armour not be?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A few items of the Soulfire Quest are NO DROP.
        Good. The Testimony of Truth Quest, some of the components are NO DROP.
        Good. MAKE Soulfire, Ghoulbane, Fiery Avenger, Crafted Armour, Glowing
        Wooden Crooks, Treant Staffs, Flowing Black Robes, etc etc all NO DROP,
        NO TRADE. These are defining pieces of Equipment for a certain class.
        MAKE them defining. When a character picks up that item from a MOB they
        have defeated, with their friends standing around, they will be proud,
        happy, WANT to play more. When a character sends a quick tell, saying
        they will pay 400plat for a Crafted Helm for their twinked character
        because they are level 40 and have lots of money, that is no good. Their
        secondary Warrior should have to go to Sol A, kill the Gob, get the
        Totem, go to South Karana, buy the rubies, get the Helm, put it on,
        smile.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Economy : This would not change the player economy
        much(And what would happen to EBay?). It would change it, and maybe not
        make it as viable at higher levels, but if Alchemy were fixed, Plate
        Armour introduced, player made items that were better than Merchants,
        the economy would thrive. Banded Armour is a must and is a perfect
        example. The only problem being, that it never disappears or wears out
        etc. The market floods with it. IF items were actually useful and needed
        continual purchasing, the market would work. Did you know Chrysler could
        build a car that would run for decades, just use the right parts. It
        would be expensive, but let's say you never had to buy one again. You
        gave it your children when you die, etc. Cars wear out. People buy new
        cars. I bet my Banded Armour, that I wore way back in level 15, is on
        some level 4 twinked character because there is too much banded.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Secondary Characters : This is a point I feel is a
        crying shame with Verant. They have so many servers. UO was a different
        story, but EQ could have worked this out much nicer. They have enough
        servers to give you ONE character per server. None of this buyer/seller
        crap. For example, someone could make a character for buying and selling
        that has 200 Charisma and is level 3. They can get a steel breast plate
        for 300pp. WTF? ONE character per server. If you want to start another
        character, go to a different server and get your friends to come help.
        It would not eliminate all of the problems, but it would stop a complete
        abuse of the system, that being a secondary character for a specific
        purpose.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Will I keep playing EQ? Not forever, but, because
        of the people I play with, I will stay for now. I want to help everyone
        get the things they want, gain xp and get new levels. Arc loves EQ and
        the people she plays with. It has become a part of our lives(sometimes
        too large), but has on the whole been a positive experience. What would
        we do with our evenings if we did not play? Have to watch TV or
        something more useless than that. :-) As long as my friends are there, I
        will continue to play. If they start to leave, I will be gone before
        they finish telling us their intentions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">To sum up :</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">ONE character per server.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">ALL &quot;defining&quot; Quest items and
        components, NO DROP, NO TRADE.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">ECONOMY : Make it work. Things should decay.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Well, thoughts?</font></p>
