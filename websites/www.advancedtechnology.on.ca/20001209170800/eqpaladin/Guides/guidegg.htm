        <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">by Gil-Glorion</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">This document is intended to be an inclusive
        Paladin's guide. In it, I highlight the strengths and weakness of the
        Paladin class, and tell you what and what not to do to be effective. I
        have read all of the Paladin guides I know of, and while they all
        contain good information, none of them IMO tell you all you need to
        know. Telling you your strengths and weaknesses is good, but none of
        them that I have read have told you what to actually do to minimize the
        weaknesses and use the strengths to their greatest advantage. I hope to
        do this. Let me be frank, Paladins are weaker generally in any role
        until after level 22. Playing a Paladin before this consists of knowing
        how to use your strengths and minimize your weaknesses. Some of this is
        HEAVILY IMO, and could be disputed. I don't cover how to act as a
        Paladin here, as it would make this too long.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The basic <b>strengths</b> of the Paladin are:</font>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial">The ability to save the day in a way that no
            one else can with Lay Hands. This is possibly the best ability in
            the game.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">The ability to provide backup healing/buffing.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">The ability to Tank (which comes to full
            fruition at level 20).</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">The ability to (after level 15) be very
            effective against undead.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">the ability to solo pretty well.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial">The <b>weaknesses</b> are:</font>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial">The ability to tank is not very good until
            level 20.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">Leveling is *very* slow.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">You do not get spells until relatively late in
            your career.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><b>Starting as a Paladin</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Paladins need STR (for plate armor) and WIS (for
        mana) primarily.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I would say that an 85 STR is minimum to carry
        loot and wear armor (and even then you will need buffing magics
        probably).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Having less than a 90 or so WIS begins to degrade
        the primary benefit of a Paladin, which is the healing/buffing/undead
        DD/Undead Lull ability. If you leave WIS at 60, why not just be a
        Warrior?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Racially, each choice has it's pros and cons. I
        refer you to other guides concerning races as they are much better than
        anything I could give you here (eq.stratics.com for example). I chose a
        High Elf for RP purposes, but a Dwarf or Human are argueably the best
        choices.</font>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 1 drop 5 points into 1 handed slash.
            This isn't essential but it gives you a nice headstart. Maybe one or
            two into Taunt is helpful as well.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 4 I dropped 10 points into tailoring
            and did not regret it (but I wouldn't say this is necessary since
            you can buy Patchwork now for cheap. Back then hardly anyone knew
            how to tailor). If you don't you might want to consider dropping
            some into 2 handed slash.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 6 I drop 10 points into Sense Heading.
            I guess you could build this from nothing but it takes forever, and
            Sense Heading is *very* valuable.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 6, drop 1 point into Bash.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 9 drop 1 point into Channeling,
            Divination, Alteration, and Abjuration.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 10, drop 1 point into Dodge,</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 12, drop 1 point into Meditate.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 15, save yourself a LOT of frustration
            and drop at least 10 points into Conjuration. Hammer of Wrath costs
            50 mana and is your firstn Conjuration spell (i.e. you haven't built
            it up before now). Building it from base is hideously time consuming
            and wastes TONS of mana. Also drop at least 10 points into Evocation
            for Ward Undead if you can.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 17, drop 1 point into Parry.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial">At level 20, drop 20 points into Double Strike.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><b>Starting out</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I would solo until level 5 at least since this
        will usually get you to where you need to be the quickest. No matter
        where you are, kill everything in your path that will not hurt an
        important faction (like Pixie Tricksters for example). Stay near the
        guards if you need to run. You should at a minimum have full patchwork
        and a rusty weapon soon. Most any Newbie zone is ok at this level. Build
        both 1 and 2 handed slash at these levels.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Levels 5-9 are really hard. You will need friends
        that will let you group with then even though you hit less often and
        can't cast anything yet. Many powergamers will shun you (especially if
        you just used your Lay Hands) but hopefully some will be impressed by
        your brevity (you are selfless and willing to lay down your life to save
        another, right?). When you get a group of friends to adventure with,
        tank tank tank. Build Taunt. Try to keep the monsters off everyone else,
        even if you are not the only tank.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Other players will appreciate this. I always Taunt
        in combat unless I'm under two bubbles of health. Use your Lay Hands
        sparingly, but use it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Don't hog it to yourself. I almost never waste my
        Lay Hands to defeat a tough monster I/we would otherwise not be able to
        kill. Save it for when a party member really needs it. You will make a
        lot of friends this way. Whenever I see a party member at less than a
        bubble in combat, I Lay On them. Your true usefulness now (and forever)
        is saving the day when no one else can. Almost no class can save the day
        like you can at this level (and none EVER in so dramatic a fashion). If
        you waste your Lay Hands to solo a tough monster, you will not be able
        to &quot;save the day&quot;. Misty Thicket is where I was at this level,
        and I made out well there. If you have the patience, build 1 handed
        blunt. This isn't necessary, but it will save you time later.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Levels 6 you get Bash, and I *HIGHLY* recommend
        you use it. Don't listen to people who say Bash is useless. They are
        wrong when it comes to a Paladin and Bash. Bash may not be good for
        other classes, but it is VERY good for you. It's especially useful with
        a Shiny Brass shield since you can Bash ghouls and such. I bash on an
        average or 6-8 points per hit. Complimented with a Combine weapon, you
        close the gap a little between those dual wielding, kicking fighters.
        Still not as good, but much better.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">An additional recommendation-Don't use a Minotaur
        Axe. They are too slow for you as the only attack you have, and without
        Kick or Dual Wield you really pale in comparison to other tanks. Try to
        get a regular/steel/fine steel Longsword or Scimitar. You hit almost
        twice as fast for just a few points less damage per whack. As a Paladin,
        this will work out better. Trust me on this one.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Levels 9-12 are much better. You *finally* can
        heal and buff yourself, which are lifesavers. I recommend you spend a
        level or so soloing at level 9 to bring up your feeble magical skills (I
        did this in Misty Thicket on obs/spiders/wasps). By level 10 you should
        be good to go and are ready to be a more valuable asset to the group.
        Continue doing what you were doing before in groups, except now you can
        heal/cure disease/buff too. By now you should be making some decent
        cash. Start saving for a Combine Longsword/Scimitar and a Shiny Brass
        Shield. I know you are hating that newbie look by now, but you can live
        in leather armor until level 14-15 if you need to. Crushbone,
        Blackburrow, and Paw are good places for you at this level. Complimented
        with a Combine weapon, you close the gap a little between those dual
        weilding kicking fighters. Still not as good, but much better. I
        developed 2 handed slash until this level, then dropped it (left it at
        65 or so) to use Bash. It's still high enough to pick it up again later
        this way. Meditate also makes the mana gain a lot faster, and Dodge is
        nice too. Good places for you now are Befallen and Unrest.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Levels 15-17 You get spell upgrades (yay!). Hammer
        of Wrath, Holy Armor, Cure Disease, Ward Undead, all are great assests
        and against undead you are a great benefit to any group. If you don't
        have that shiny Combine yet, Hammer of Wrath works just fine and is
        almost as good in fact. I did not build 1 handed blunt until level 13 or
        so, and it went up slowly to start but it did go up. Ward Undead is an
        awesome spell and is the most efficient way to draw from distances and
        kill undead for you. Once again, you may want to solo a while to develop
        it. I cannot over-emphasize it's utility for you. Alone I use it mainly
        draw and finish off undead, keeping a store to heal myself in combat. In
        groups I burn it all onto them and between that and me hacking away I do
        a lot of damage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">If you don't have a Combine sword (or Hammer of
        Wrath handy with good 1 handed blunt skill), Shiny Brass Shield, and at
        least partial Banded/Ring/Chain armor, you need to make that top
        priority. You need all these IMO to do your job in a group. You
        definitely go up a bunch of notches on the usefulness scale at these
        levels, especially in places like Unrest and Befallen. I began to
        successfully lead and primary tank in groups around this level.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Levels 17-19 This is the final stretch for us
        brothers. At 17 we get Parry which is a great additon. Not much else to
        say. Your mana has gotten to the point where you can do a very good
        amount of healing and dish out some serious justice to undead. From my
        observations, if you put stat points where I told you to, you should
        have a ton of the blue stuff in comparison to what your spells cost.
        People actually start looking for Paladins now. Unrest is still good but
        Befallen is probably too low level for you now. You will do well
        anywhere, but I still recommend you stick to undead areas.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Levels 20-22, and beyond. You made it. You finally
        get Double Strike and this closes the substantial gap between you and
        the Warrior in terms of dishing out damage. At this level your fighting
        ability is finally comparable to the other tanks. Level 22 Spells bring
        Root, Center, and Invisibility to Undead (among others). These are the
        just about the most important spells you will ever get, especially Root.
        You should already have enough experience in the game to know what I
        mean by that. I can't say much about anything beyond this range, I can't
        see that far.</font></p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><b>Soloing</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Soloing is never really easy, and it's not nearly
        as much fun as grouping, but so far as the ability to do it goes a
        Paladin is pretty good. I have probably soloed about 4-5 levels in total
        (besides 1-5). Paladins are good at soloing mainly because after level 9
        you can heal yourself during combat instead of running when it gets
        hairy. Really tough monsters will interrupt you when casting, but whites
        and under usually will not (depends). With practice, you can become
        fairly adept at tabbing between yourself and your target to heal. Always
        keep buffs on, and pick a place near a wall or corner. This was you have
        50%-75% less area to keep a watch for monsters wanting to join your
        fight. Of course, always have a clear exit to run (preferably with
        guards). I suggest you do NOT rely on Lay Hands to beat tough monsters
        unless the payoff is enormous (like if you see a monster carrying a
        great weapon or something). This practice is good once, but since you
        can't do it consistantly, it's not worth being screwed later on because
        you used your Lay Hands. When you solo, you need to take single blues
        one after another as fast as possible with Lay Hands as a backup. You
        should not take one Yellow or Red per hour+half then blues after that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">he best thing to do is to run up, hit a single
        blue, then run back to your cubby hole (drawing the monster back) to
        finish it at levels before 15. Rinse and repeat. This is the basic
        process for most any character. At level 15, if you solo undead you can
        stay in your cubby hole and draw single undead to you with Ward Undead.
        When doing this, conserve mana for healing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Use one Ward Undead to draw then hold off and just
        melee it. If it starts going bad, heal yourself and duke it out. If it
        goes well and the monster flees, hit it with WU again so you don't have
        to follow and expose yourself to more risk. You can also use Lull Undead
        to take only a single monster when there are two, although I rarely
        found this to be worth doing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">At level 22 you get Root to make them stay put.
        This is very important since by then you will be doing more damage
        faster, and monsters will tend to flee earlier and bring back really
        tough nasties if you let them. Root is essential to solo at later
        levels.</font></p>
