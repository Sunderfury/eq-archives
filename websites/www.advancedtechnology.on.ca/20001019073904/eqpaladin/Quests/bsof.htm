        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 1
        :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>Aye, you are a Paladin of great experience and
        are respected throughout the land for your Valour and Generosity.
        Valeron Dushire, your fearless Guild Leader, requests your presence in
        the Hall of Truth. You find Valeron atop a balcony, watching young
        Paladins train in the Art of War. He turns to see you approach, his face
        grim, his eyes unnerving. &quot;I have the greatest of Tasks for you
        Friend.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 2
        :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>You draw your blade from its sheath, place it
        before Valeron's feet and pledge your allegiance, and Life, to Mithaniel
        Marr and the Hall of Truth. &quot;I&nbsp;am ready.&quot;&nbsp; Valeron
        sits atop the battlements and tells you of the Great Crusade into the
        heart of Faydwer. When the Paladins of Freeport set upon their journey,
        Valeron left Sir Lucan D'Lere the task of maintaining the Hall and
        sending fresh troops to Faydwer. As the last ship floated out of sight,
        Sir Lucan and his men murdered all of the remaining Paladins while they
        slept. Sir Lucan quickly gathered up his forces and formed the Freeport
        Militia. The Militia quickly gained popularity and support as weak
        requirements and bribery quickly became commonplace.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 3
        :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>Valeron looks at you, anguish is his eyes. He
        tells of their victorious return to Freeport, and the horror of seeing
        his kin, and the Hall of Truth in shambles from Sir Lucan's reign of
        terror. Sir Lucan's Militia was very powerful and is even now a force to
        be reckoned with. Valeron tells you of the only way to stop this
        madness. Go to West Freeport, find Sir Lucan and destroy him. Valeron
        tells you of a Testimony Sir Lucan possesses from his time as a Paladin.
        He pleads with you to return this testimony and restore the Honour and
        Integrity of the Paladins of Marr, the People of Freeport, and the
        Sanctity of a Paladins Testimony.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 4
        :</font>&nbsp;</font></b>You quickly gather up your sword, collect your
        armour and leave the Hall. Gather your friends about you. Destroy Sir
        Lucan. After meeting Sir Lucan and his cohorts in the Freeport Militia
        House, a great battle ensues. With a final blow from your sword, Sir
        Lucan falls to the ground. As you reach down to retrieve the Testimony,
        Sir Lucan rises from the Dead! His gaping wounds no longer bleeding, he
        comes at you and your party. After an eternity, the soulless zombie
        falls to the floor. You reach down to grab the Testimony.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 5
        :</font> </font></b>The Militia is broken! Sir Lucan is dead! Your party
        rushes back to North Freeport and the support of the Paladins who defend
        this part of the city. You enter the Hall of Truth and hand Valeron the
        Testimony. Valeron looks at you with pride and joy. He ushers you into
        his chambers and draws a blade from a scabbard on the wall. &quot;Take
        this blade and defend all that require it. Thou art truly a great
        Paladin, and one who deserves the Respect of All.&quot; You remember
        seeing this blade on your induction to Paladinhood. It is the Famed
        Brilliant Sword of Faith! You are now truly on the road to destroying
        ALL&nbsp;evil in Norrath! Fare thee well Friend!</font></p>
