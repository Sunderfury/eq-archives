      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#808080">Chapter 1 :</font></b> <font face="Arial">Wandering
      through the Beholder Maze, you see a tough little Dwarf, swinging heavily
      at a small outcropping of rock.&nbsp; He looks tired, but greets you with
      a smile and tells you his name is Diggs Duggun.&nbsp;&nbsp; You hail him
      and he responds heartily, <font color="#0000FF">&quot;</font></font><font color="#0000FF"></font><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000FF">ail,
      dere! Ain'tcha a sight fer me sore eyes! I knows dat we're strangers an'
      all, but might I ask a [boon] of ye?&quot;</font>&nbsp; You look to him
      quizzically and ask him about the &quot;boon&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; He hefts
      an enormous pick axe onto his shoulder, peering at its chipped and scarred
      tip.&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Well, me pickaxe is blunted awfully
      bad and me ale supplies are dangerously low. If'n ye would be kind enough
      t' get me a new pick and a couple o' bottles o' dwarven ale, I would be
      f'rever in yer debt.&quot; </font> You know the only place to find Dwarven
      Ale is in Kaladim, as is the type of pick axe he requires, and as you were
      heading over to make peace with the Gnomish King, you decide Kaladim is
      not too far out of your way.&nbsp; Diggs happily accepts your assistance,
      and with a whispered curse to his pick axe, continues hacking away at the
      unyielding rock.</font><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#808080">Chapter
      2 :</font></b> <font face="Arial">You travel through Norrath, finding a
      friendly Elven Druid to use his earthen magics to transport you to a
      Druidic Ring outside of Ak'Anon.&nbsp; After a brief visit to the Gnomish
      King, you give up on explaining that Clockworks are easily expendible and
      head out to Kaladim.&nbsp; Just outside of the bank in the Great Dwarven
      City, you find a vendor that stocks pick axes similar to Diggs'.&nbsp; You
      purchase the pick axe and stop by the tavern on the way out to purchase
      two bottles of Dwarven Ale.&nbsp; Thanking the dwarves for their
      hospitality, you head to the docks and wait for the ship to sail you back
      towards the Beholder Maze.&nbsp; </font><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#808080">Chapter
      3 :</font></b> <font face="Arial">Travelling through Freeport, the Commons
      and deadly Kithicor Forest, you arrive at Misty Thicket for a night's
      rest.&nbsp; You set out in the morning, walking quietly through the Misty
      Thicket, slaying Goblins who are constantly assaulting the Wall.&nbsp;
      Slippping through Runnyeye, you arrive back in the Beholder Maze and
      search for Diggs.&nbsp; You find him cleaning off his pick axe, blood
      crusted on his head and two Great Minotaurs lying in a heap.&nbsp; You
      heal him with the magic of Marr and he looks at you expectantly.&nbsp; You
      hand him the pick axe and his 2 Dwarven Ales(not stacked).&nbsp; Diggs
      drinks an ale heartily and burps loudly, <font color="#0000FF">&quot;By
      Brell's Beard! Yer a lifesaver, ya are! 'ere, take dis bone I've found
      'ere in dis maze. Looks human ta me and I'm thinkin that a proper burial
      is in order. Freeport's the closest place dat has one o' Marr's temples.
      I'm thinkin dis was one o' his Holy Knights by da look o' da tattered
      tunic I found it wrapped in. I'm thinkin Valeron might be havin an
      interest in it.&quot; </font>&nbsp; With that he hands you a dusty old leg
      bone and you head out thanking him for his gift.<br>
      </font><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#808080">Chapter 4 :</font></b>
      <font face="Arial">Returning to Freeport, you head through the familiar
      Hall of Truth and find Valeron looking out upon shackled Militia in the
      courtyard.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are burnishing plate armour for the Knights of
      Truth, paying justice for the evil their ilk has brought.&nbsp; Valeron
      looks upon you warmly and you explain to that you met Diggs Duggun in the
      Beholder Maze.&nbsp; Valeron gazes upon the dusty leg bone and finds some
      cloth under the knee.&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">&quot;According to this
      crest on the tunic, you have recovered one of the bones of a lost Paladin
      [Hero].&quot;</font>&nbsp; Interested, you ask what Hero would that
      be?&nbsp; Valeron looks upon you with pride and says, <font color="#0000FF">&quot;His
      name has been long lost but his legend lives on in every young knight who
      aspires to continue his fight. He attempted to quell an evil that resided
      within Kithicor, perverting nature itself. Much to his relief, it was an
      earthly foe he fought against and not a denizen summoned from the planes
      of evil. Then, suddenly, he was surrounded by dozens of dark elves. He was
      captured and taken to the Dead to be experimented upon and had his soul
      twisted by vile necromantic magics. Then the Tier'Dal cast his remains to
      the winds. Where they landed, no one knew, until now. You have found one
      of his bones. I hereby charge you with a Holy Quest to bring this Hero's
      bones back for a burial with honors. Do you [accept], knight?&quot;</font>&nbsp;
      You know there is no better reason in life than to serve the memory of a
      Hero and graciously accept.&nbsp; Valeron Dushire says <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Good!
      I knew you would. It is one of the highest honors one can receive. Your
      quest will not be easy for I know not where his other bones lay. A spy of
      ours within Neriak was able to surmise that six of his bones along with
      his sword and shield were scattered throughout Norrath. You must search
      far and wide to find the remaining pieces, as you already have one.. Do
      not give up. It is now your sacred duty. Once you have retrieved all eight
      pieces, come back to me and inform me that you [have all the bones].&quot;</font></font><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#808080">Chapter
      5 :</font></b> <font face="Arial">You head out from the Hall of Truth,
      Courage and Bravery leading the way!&nbsp; You begin to hear rumours of
      these bones and after a month's worth of travel across all of Norrath, you
      are able to surmise the location of many of the parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you
      retrieve the last part, you look into your backpack and recount the items
      you have found:<br>
      <font color="#FF0000">A dusty leg</font>, the first piece you received
      from your friend Diggs Duggun.<br>
      <font color="#FF0000">A dusty skull</font>, found in the Mino Caves in
      Meldrith's room.<br>
      <font color="#FF0000">A dusty ribcage</font>, found half buried in the
      Garden at Mistmoore Castle.<br>
      <font color="#FF0000">A dusty backbone</font>, found in a Pit of Ghosts
      within Unrest.<br>
      <font color="#FF0000">A dusty Jawbone,</font> found deep within an Ice
      Cave in Everfrost.<br>
      <font color="#FF0000">A dusty fingerbone</font>, found within Phinigel's
      room on a ledge in murky Kedge Keep.<br>
      <font color="#FF0000">A dusty broken Sword</font>, found in the very Mines
      of Kaladim, just under the water.<br>
      <font color="#FF0000">A dusty Shield</font>, found on the Eastern Cliffs
      in Erudin.<br>
      You know this part of your journey has come to an end and return to the
      Hall ofTruth.&nbsp; </font><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#808080">Chapter
      6 :</font></b> <font face="Arial">Valeron is happy to see you and is
      impressed by the journey's you have undergone in the search for the Hero's
      bones.&nbsp; You tell him you have all of the bones and he says, <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Excellent!
      You are indeed worthy to bear the title of Holy Knight! Now, about the
      coffin.. I have spoken with Ping Fizzlecutter, outside the western gates.
      Ask him about the coffin and once it is made, bring it to Simon Aldicott
      of Marr. I shall have Simon meet you by the lake in the Commonlands after
      Ping gives you the coffin.&quot;</font>&nbsp; You thank Valeron and head
      over to meet Ping at the Western Gates.</font><p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#808080">Chapter
      7 :</font></b> <font face="Arial">Ping has heard of your great journey
      across Norrath and offers to make you the coffin for free if you can bring
      him the proper ingredients.&nbsp; You thank him and jot down the
      ingredients on a piece of paper.&nbsp; You require : <br>
      <font color="#FF0000">1 Diamond<br>
      1 Star Ruby<br>
      1 Pearl<br>
      1 Fire Emerald from Firiona Vie<br>
      1 Sapphire<br>
      1 Fire Opal<br>
      and 2 Enchanted Platinum Bars.&nbsp; </font></font><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#808080">Chapter
      8 :</font></b> <font face="Arial">You replenish your supplies in Freeport
      and head out to gather the gems required to bury this Hero with Honour.&nbsp;
      After a few battles, and an empty bank, you hand Ping the gems and within
      the week has the coffin prepared.&nbsp; You know you must find Simon
      Aldicott, a Cleric who will complete the burial with Prayers and
      Blessings.&nbsp; He is in West Commons and you find him fishing by the
      Lake.&nbsp; You greet him and open up the coffin.&nbsp; Placing all of the
      Hero's bones within the coffins walls, you hand Simon the coffin and he
      begins to pray to Marr for this Hero's soul.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#808080">Chapter
      9 :</font></b> <font face="Arial">While Simon continues the Ceremony, you
      hear a fitful yell and see someone you know as Darak Lightforge</font><font face="Arial">
      charging towards Simon, blade in hand.&nbsp; You leap into the path and
      enter a great melee with Darak.&nbsp; He is a great warrior and puts you
      to the test.&nbsp; When you finally find an opening in his defense, you
      are spent as your blade bites deep, ending the fight and Darak's
      life.&nbsp; You retrieve Darak's remains and hand them to
      Simon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simon stands from his Prayers and thanks you for saving
      his life.&nbsp; He tells you he must continue the Ceremony for the Hero
      and hands you a fine scroll, sealed with wax and neatly written.&nbsp; He
      tells you this scroll should be memorized and put into your Spell
      Book.&nbsp; It will offer you a Blessing upon any Blade you wield,
      granting extra damage in the name of Righteousness.&nbsp; </font><p><font face="Arial">Spell
