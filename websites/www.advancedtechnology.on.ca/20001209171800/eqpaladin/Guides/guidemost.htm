                monsters to you.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial">One Hand Slashing - This skill is of less
                use to a Paladin than to fighters who can learn to use two
                weapons. You should still keep this skill near maximum for the
                day you get a Ghoulbane.</font></li>

                don't have a magic weapon by level 15, and you need to use the
                summoned hammer. Who knows, you might some day get a Holy Water

                you're going to get healing magic at level 9. YMMV</font></li>

                innate sense of direction (start with a 50 skill). Make a
                hot-key and when you reach level 10, get into the habit of

                Taunt button.</font></li>

                one monster off of you long enough to defeat another (or flee).

              in at the Kaladim Paladin guild. You can often buy bone chips for
              around 2sp from merchants near newbie areas. If you do any
              traveling, check the stores for bone chips. If the four chips for
              the quest cost you 8sp, you will actually make money on average
              from the quest, as well as earn experience and faction
              improvements.</font></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial">Save all of the belts and pads you get to
              turn in to Canloe Nusback at the Kaladim Warrior guild. If you can
              buy the belts from other players for 2 or 3gp each, it will be
              worth it. Turn them in four at a time for better rewards, usually
              patchwork armor and rusty two-handed weapons. Once you've done
              these quests a few times, you'll get better deals from dwarven
              merchants.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Start at orc hill, and run to the guards at
              the orc lift when you are in danger. Don't wait too long, as these
              guards are not quick to respond to the presence of enemies.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Move inside Crushbone when you can, and get
              bound in the tunnel on the Greater Faydark side. Stay away from
              the train tracks near the zone, and hunt to the left of the
              entrance to start. Collect everything the orcs drop, and sell it
              at a merchant. Crushbone can be profitable in both money and
              experience. Avoid the castle interior when it is full of orcs and
              you are alone, until you turn 15, when you can use lull to pull an
              orc or two from a small crowd.</font></p>

              bugs, TDs, jacks, and ghouls.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial">The place to rest and pull to in Unrest is
              against the wall on the left side of the house, near the porch, <i>between
              the two trees</i>. If you watch the pathing of the yard trash in
              Unrest, you will see that they don't come anywhere near the wall
              between the trees. You can rest there without worrying about
              trains or yard trash jumping you while meditating.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Learn how to pull well in Unrest and you
              find it easier to get a group.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">One thing to remember about pulling though
              the porch door is don't jump the rail or get too far ahead of the
              mobs. If you do, they will go back in the house and exit using the
              back door, pulling the contents of the back room with them.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">When you start pulling from the second
              floor, always come down the front stairs. There is a bug that can
              cause the monsters in the house to come out of the house after you
              without you pulling them. This problem seems to come and go, but
              when you've got autopull, you'll know it.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Pulling the bar can pull some of the
              monsters from the tower as well (and vice versa).</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">If you are in a good group, you don't need
              to be afraid of hags. Just get <i>everyone</i> to melee with her,
              and she will be unable to cast. A magic resistance buff will help
              a lot.</font></p>
