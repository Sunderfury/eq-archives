        <p align="center"><b><font size="5" face="Arial">Paladins and Moral
        Issues - Varrus Aurelius</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Greetings all,</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I do not like to &quot;rant&quot;
        much. I love the game and I appreciate all of the things Verant and team
        goes through every day.&nbsp; BUT, if I hear from Brad or Gordon once
        more about how Paladin Quests are moral dilemmas, I WILL SCREAM!!!!!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Unless Verant feels it is acceptable for Paladins
        to be running around in Steel Armour and wielding Fine Steel 2 Handed
        Swords, there is a serious issue here.&nbsp; The name of the game is
        EverQUEST.&nbsp; What other choices do we truly have in playing this
        game?&nbsp; Aside from being completely worthless at higher levels using
        an FS blade, or a Ykesha if we can beat back the Rangers looking for
        one, what choice do we have? NONE.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">We *have* to get our Quest Armour to keep pace
        with the other members in our party.&nbsp; We *have* to get a weapon
        that works well and hopefully puts out enough damage to make us feel
        helpful.&nbsp; And <i>most importantly</i>, we HAVE to Quest.&nbsp; That
        is why most of us purchased this game.&nbsp; That's right, I CHOSE to be
        a Paladin, so I would like to Quest as a Paladin, fight as a Paladin and
        play like a Paladin.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Now the THREE major examples we have to look at
        are Ghoulbane, Armour of Ro and Fiery Avenger.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="4">Ghoulbane - </font></b>To my
        knowledge, no one has found a Quest that relates to the blade. A Paladin
        killed the Shin Lord one day and got Ghoulbane, saw the stats, told all
        his friends and it became one of the the most valuable items in the
        game.&nbsp; Suddenly, we realize that Frogloks are not necessarily evil.&nbsp;
        They are neutral to good at best.&nbsp; They hate Trolls, and have
        allied themselves with the Minotaurs in Lower Guk to destroy their
        undead counterparts who threaten to overrun their once great Kingdom.&nbsp;
        The Shin Lord, one of the Frogloks greatest Paladins, wields the famed
        Ghoulbane.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="3">Verant's position :</font><font size="4">
        </font></b>Will you kill a neutral to good creature who would never
        attack you unless provoked?&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="3">Paladin's viewpoint :</font></b>
        Yes, we do not <i>have</i> to kill him.&nbsp; Yes, an FS Longsword does
        respectable damage.&nbsp; Even 2 FS Longswords do respectable damage, of
        course Paladins do not get dual wield (nor should we).&nbsp; Ghoulbane
        is the *only* blade that makes a Paladin worth his/her salt after level
        30.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it acceptable for a Paladin to wield a Fine Steel
        Longsword, or a Blackened Iron Bastard Sword until level 40+, at which
        time an assault on Sir Lucan is possible?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="3">Solution : </font></b>Make a
        Quest, let the Shin Lord give us the blade upon handing in items.&nbsp;
        Stop the unnecessary &quot;moral&quot; tactics to cover up bad writing
        and lack of originality.&nbsp; The hidden saga of the Frogloks battles
        and history are great!&nbsp; Why stop there?&nbsp; Give us the Quest,
        give us an opportunity to become <i>part</i> of the story.&nbsp; OR,
        give us another blade that requires some half intelligent Quest that
        allows us to gain a decent weapon without infringing on a &quot;neutral
        or good&quot; race.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Some would argue that Ghoulbane or your weapon
        does not &quot;make&quot; or &quot;break&quot; you.&nbsp; Paladins and
        ShadowKnights are not given the ability to Dual Wield for obvious
        reasons.&nbsp; This makes it necessary for our classes to have a decent
        one handed slashing weapon.&nbsp; Many see Paladins as Sword and Shield.&nbsp;
        With the removal of Fiery Avenger and Ghoulbane, due to
        &quot;moral&quot; issues (read: bad writing or ideas).&nbsp; One of our
        main weapons would be SoulFire.&nbsp; That is fine, but it excludes 90%
        of Paladins from getting it (must be 40+).&nbsp; Do not <i>give </i>us a
        good blade, make us <i>work </i>for it.&nbsp; Give us moral dilemmas, <i>but
        </i>give us the opportunity to have a choice.&nbsp; To have it or not at
        all is not a choice.&nbsp; I have heard recently that there may be an
        alternate way of getting Fairy Dust through a Quest in Ak'Anon.&nbsp;
        That would be great!&nbsp; But, we are all dubious to KOS from killing
        Clockworks in Solusek's Eye for Melatite.&nbsp; Why do all of the other
        classes just go to a Merchant and buy their gems?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="4">Armour of Ro - </font></b>The
        Quests for the Molds are quite respectable.&nbsp; Aside from half being
        insanely difficult, the Quests are quite fun and challenging.&nbsp;
        Again, the ONLY Quest Armour Paladins are capable of getting are linked
        to a neutral/evil God and require the destruction of neutral/good
        beings.&nbsp; How many Paladins worship Ro?&nbsp; Why would we want
        Armour linked to a borderline Evil God?&nbsp; What other choice do we
        have?&nbsp; Steel Armour or Planes Armour when we reach 46(when it
        drops).&nbsp; That brings us to Ronium.&nbsp; Kill Clockworks and
        Fairies.&nbsp; I don't want to.&nbsp; No Ro Armour for you.&nbsp; I will
        buy it?&nbsp; No good, you are still condoning the death of
        innocent/neutral or good creatures.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial">Verant's position :</font></b><font face="Arial">
        Will you kill creatures of a PC race (Gnome Clockworks) or Fairies to
        obtain a small amount of what you require to make your Armour of Ro?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Paladin's viewpoint :</b> Completely
        unacceptable.&nbsp; I don't want to kill Fairies.&nbsp; Thanks to the
        Goblins in Solusek's Eye, I was able to purchase full Steel Armour at
        around level 33+.&nbsp; Can I be expected to wear this armour until I
        reach 46+ and try for Planes Armour?&nbsp; What other items are
        available that have the AC of Steel and stat buffs of other types?&nbsp;
        None.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="4"><b>Fiery Avenger - </b></font><font size="3">The
        Quest was great fun and I am glad we all came together to work it out!&nbsp;
        It was a lot of fun and makes everyone happy thinking about wielding
        that great blade!&nbsp; BUT, NO Paladin can receive FA without condoning
        or participating in the slaughter of Frogloks.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">There are a few more Quests that contain more
        questionable practices (Test of Truth, Deep Six Cutlass) but I think you
        get the idea.&nbsp; Verant smiles smugly and tells us these are moral
        dilemmas we must decide upon.&nbsp; I say to Verant, what is left of
        your game if Paladins refused to do the evil things you want them to?
        Nothing, why would we play a game that is <i>made </i>to destroy our
        ideals?&nbsp; We <i>need </i>the option to complete them a different way
        in the way you have created them.&nbsp; A word needs to be said of the
        other class Quests.&nbsp; On the whole, these Quests have been great!&nbsp;
        Rogue Armour is a little boring, Bard Armour is a little too easy and
        Warrior Armour was <i>amazing </i>when you released it.&nbsp; Yes, one
        of my Companions is a Warrior and we had a GREAT time getting his
        Crafted Armour.&nbsp; It left me very excited to work on my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Does this sound like every Quest can and will
        conflict with some Paladin's views or beliefs?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; A little
        creativity will go a LONG way.&nbsp; As mentioned previously, MAKE the
        Shin Lord give us a Quest.&nbsp; Tell us he is a sick froggie, his leg
        is gimp and he can't fight anymore.&nbsp; Retrieve this and this and
        this and we will give you Ghoulbane to assist all froggy kind in our
        Crusade!&nbsp; At least getting three NO DROP items would be more
        difficult than standing in a mossy room and killing a frog when he
        spawns.&nbsp; Armour of Ro?&nbsp; Umm, it is not difficult to add an NPC
        to Qeynos, Felwithe, Erudin and Freeport, etc. and have him give the
        Armour out.&nbsp; The Blacksmithing component has been removed.&nbsp;
        Have a Dwarf standing outside of Groflah's in Freeport.&nbsp; Hand him
        the bar of Ronium and the Mold.&nbsp; He gives you the Armour piece.&nbsp;
        And look, it is called the Armour of Marr!&nbsp; I, a <i>PALADIN, </i>have
        proved myself worthy to my God, Mithaniel Marr and he has gifted me with
        his blessings upon my armour.&nbsp; Is it too difficult to have
        different names on the same item?&nbsp; Make Erud Armour, Armour of
        Prexus, etc etc.&nbsp; Leave the name Ronium as a Fire God would be
        suitable for smelting metal. Leave Lord Searfire and the Cauldron
        component, it is fine.&nbsp; hehe See?&nbsp; I solved about half of the
        problems right there (with fixing the Fairy and Melatite drops on
        something else or on a Merchant).&nbsp;&nbsp;And I can even fix that.&nbsp;
        Put Melatite for sale in Ak'Anon or Solusek's Eye.&nbsp; Remove the
        Fairy Dust component and make it Undead Froglok tongues.&nbsp; Wouldn't
        putting some components or acheivements on Undead creatures make a lot
        of sense?</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>The Future</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">What saddens me in all of this, is the complete
        dependence of material items.&nbsp; In UO (that was a long time ago) the
        characters had a personality, or were more reliant on their skills and
        reputation to make relationships and successful adventuring work.&nbsp;
        Now, to clear the air, EQ is a far superior game to UO.&nbsp; I am glad
        it is here and it truly is exciting to think about the future.&nbsp; EQ <i>brought</i>
        us that future and pleased us all!&nbsp; But the addition of SOOPR STAT
        Equipment lends EQ a major flaw.&nbsp; The removal of
        &quot;personality&quot; or ability.&nbsp; In EQ, if you do not have the
        equipment, you do not measure up to the task.&nbsp; Sure, you can
        roleplay and make friends and co-operate and go on Planes raids and help
        a little.&nbsp; BUT, you CANNOT assist or be a large force in a group
        without good equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a shame and I hope the day
        comes when equipment plays <i>less</i> of a role, and the <i>character</i>
        is more important.&nbsp; A little UO story that my Companions would
        surely back up. :-)&nbsp; I played a Paladin in UO.&nbsp; Yes, I did not
        have one offensive spell in my Spell book, did not use Archery(nor do I
        as a human in EQ) and fought with a Halberd or Sword/Shield.&nbsp; I was
        at a SEVERE disadvantage in PvP but worked quite well in PvE situations.&nbsp;
        The secret was, I still made a difference, be that interrupting or
        scaring casters, or taking the hits while my Companions blasted
        everything they could. :-)&nbsp; I also made an Archer, right before OSI
        improved it.&nbsp; I fought with a Longsword in close melee and used my
        bow 90% of the time.&nbsp; Although I was quite useless, I added flavour
        and fun for my group.&nbsp; It was quite amusing when a month later, OSI
        put in the Archery fixes and it became on of the best skills in the
        game.&nbsp; But alas, I had retired Connor and was focusing solely on my
        Paladin.&nbsp; In EQ, in a group of 6, you do not have room for flavour.&nbsp;
        If you are not a contributing member, you are endangering the life span
        of your group.&nbsp; I am level 39 right now.&nbsp; They keep looking at
        me funny when I put away Ghoulbane and fight with a Shiny Brass Shield
        and Fine Steel Longsword.&nbsp; I will <i>NOT </i>use the Mistmoore
        Shield <i>OR </i>the Shield of the Slain Unicorn.&nbsp; And I cannot use
        Ghoulbane because I would have to slaughter what amounts to an ally (Frogloks
        kill Trolls).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I think a little more clarification
        on EQ and UO needs to be made.&nbsp; I think UO gave us much more leeway
        and choice.&nbsp; I <i>could choose</i> to be a Paladin, run around with
        a slow halberd and still be effective.&nbsp; I like to think of UO as
        having a better &quot;character&quot; base.&nbsp; I prefer a class based
        system (EQ), and Verant delivered a better, faster and more enjoyable
        game.&nbsp; What does it lack?&nbsp; The <i>depth</i> of character.&nbsp;
        You are only as good as your equipment.&nbsp; We can only <i>dream</i>
        of what the future will hold.&nbsp; Could you imagine a world with the
        beauty and magic of EQ, and the character and personality of UO?&nbsp;
        Verant! Please let EQ2 be the answer!&nbsp; MAKE our Quests have
        alternative solutions, make equipment be an improvement, not a
        necessity, make our Quests challenging and difficult! Make them have a
        storyline, a <i>logical </i>outcome and solution.&nbsp; I know <i>hundreds</i>
        of Paladins on this site who could give ideas, Quests and dilemmas that
        would keep us coming back for more!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I am sure you are wondering what my position is in
        all of this.&nbsp; I will tell you.&nbsp; I kill Fairies, I kill
        Clockworks, I even kill the cute little Gnomes when they aggro on me.&nbsp;
        I wield Ghoulbane and get excited every time it procs.&nbsp; Would I
        have EVER done those things if Verant had *truly* given me a choice? No.&nbsp;
        Now, in history, or RL, we would be faced with real choices, in EQ we
        are faced with one option, do it and get the equipment or get nothing
        and do not participate in Paladin Quests. Of course, what is there to EQ
        for a Paladin without Armour of Ro, Ghoulbane or Fiery Avenger?&nbsp; Am
        I less of a Paladin for these practices?&nbsp; I would argue that in the
        context of EQ, I am more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
