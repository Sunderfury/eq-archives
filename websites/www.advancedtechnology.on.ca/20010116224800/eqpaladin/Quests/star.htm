        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 1
        -</font> </font></b>As a Paladin of some experience(level 8-12) you are
        capable of serving the Paladins of Norrath and are ready to begin your
        journeys. You have decided to leave the fold of the Temple and wander
        through Norrath, dispensing Justice and removing the stench of Evil from
        the Countryside. Astaed Wemor, a Paladin of some fame, is resting near
        the path that leads to the Temple of Life in Qeynos. You begin a
        conversation and he asks if you will be travelling afar or staying in
        the area. Of course, ready for adventure, you tell him you are
        travelling afar.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 2
        -</font> </font></b>Astaed is very happy that you are going to make a
        journey and asks you to retrieve an item he requires in Rivervale. he
        asks you to find Kizzie Mintiopp of Rivervale as she would have what he
        is looking for. Travelling to Rivervale, you find Kizzie Mintopp tending
        to her duties. You introduce yourself and tell her you are from the
        Temple of Life. You tell her of your task and she will happily help you
        if you can bring her back 3 Honeycombs and 30gp for her time. Go into
        the lands surrounding Rivervale and search for Honeycomb.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 3
        -</font> </font></b>Finding the Honeycomb, you return to Kizzie
        victorious. Hand her the 3 Honeycombs and 30gp. Kizzie smiles, throws
        the Honeycomb into a pot and shortly after, hands you a bottle to return
        to Amstaed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 4
        -</font> </font></b>After running through the Karanas, you arrive back
        at the Temple of Life and hand Amstaed the bottle. Amstaed smiles and
        throws a small herb into the bottle, whispering a short prayer. The
        juice in the bottle glows briefly and he hands you the Healing Potion.
        Amstaed tells you that Lampeck Hargrim, a farmer in West Karanas
        requires this potion. If you bring Lampeck the potion quick, Lampeck
        will give you an item that Amstaed requires, a keepsake(a rusty scythe).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 5
        -</font> </font></b>Travelling into the Karanas once again, you wander
        South, knowing his farm is close to the water. After a short while, you
        find Lampeck in his house. You hand him the potion and he pulls an old
        rusty scythe off the wall. &quot;Here&quot;, he tells you, &quot;return
        this to Amstaed.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b><font SIZE="+1"><font color="#808000">Chapter 6
        -</font> </font></b>You take the old rusty scythe and return to Qeynos,
        wondering what Amstaed would want with such an old weapon. Upon
        arriving, Amstaed is smiling. You hand him the scythe. He reaches from a
        pack on the ground and hands you a weapon that is glowing slightly.
        &quot;You have done well my friend.&quot;, Amstaed says, looking at the
        old scythe with reverence. &quot;Take this Holy Weapon, dubbed the
        Shining Star of Light and go into the land, destroying any Evil that
        should happen upon thee and thy Companions. This weapon will keep you
        from harm and your soul Cleansed lest you should falter. Go in the
        Light.&quot; With that, you heft the mighty weapon and go into the
        countryside once again....</font></p>
