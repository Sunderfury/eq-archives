<i>Compiled by many <a href="http://server3.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse"> Safehouse Rogues</a></i><br>
<br>
1. Goto Lon the Redeemed in the temple of Solusek Ro. He wants you to quest to
find two gems (stamina and rightiousness) which you are to give to Ortalius in
Sro. Talk to him, and he sends you with a note (NO DROP) to his friend the
poisoner.<br>
<br>
2. Go find Conium Darkblade in Dagnor's Cauldron(poison merchant). Give him the
note, and he gives you an axe (NO DROP) called &quot;never stops chopping&quot;
and a clue about the &quot;top of the world&quot;.<br>
<br>
3. *optional* Talk to Falyn in the back room of &quot;top of the world&quot; in
Highpass, and he sends you to Bryan.<br>
<br>
4. Goto Bryan on the deck at the Lumbermill Inn in Highpass. Give him the axe
and he gives you a bag (NO DROP) to fill with 10 different beverages from around
the world. <b>NOTE: You must have an empty MAIN slot to hold a new container or
you will receive nothing and lose the axe.</b> The drinks to fill it are:<br>
<br>
Underfoot Triple Boch - Kaladim - Tumpy Irontoe<br>

Blackburrow Swig -<br>
<br>
Need a Blackburrow Cask. Found on Gnoll Brewers/Master Brewers in Blackburrow. A
common spawn is at loc 32,32 on level 3. Placeholder is a Gnoll Guardsman.
Brewer is rare spawn, and Master Brewer ultra rare.<br>
<br>
Combine in the Blackburrow Cask: (no brewing skill needed to combine)<br>
- 4 BlackBurrow Gnoll Skins(NOT PELTS), rare drop of elite gnolls or commanders<br>
- 2 gnoll pup scalps<br>
- 2 casks of Ol' TJ's fierce brew (made using brewing trade skill)<br>
<br>
The Blackburrow Cask disappears after you correctly combine the ingredients to
make the Swig.<br>
<br>
5. Return the bag to Bryan, and he gives you the Gem of Stamnia (NO DROP).<br>
<br>
6. *optional* Goto the Freeport Sewers and find Toxdil. Ask him about the gems,
and then about the Gem Case. He tells you that he has the key, but will only
give it to you for the gem inside the case. He says he last sold it to a jewler.<br>
<br>
7. *optional* Talk to Noresa Sparkle in West Commons. She asks you to save her
from Kiz Gix. She also tells you of a &quot;Gem Case&quot;, which you would need
two keys to open, and would have to return both box and keys to the
&quot;original boxcrafter&quot; to find what is inside.<br>
<br>
8. *optional* Kiz Gix roams around befallen side of WC. Upon killing him you
recieve a note writen in Goblin, telling you of a Dark Elf &quot;Outcast&quot;
who stole a sparkling purse.<br>
<br>
9. Find the Outcast (Lynada the Exiled) in Sol A in the High Shaman room.
Killing the outcast gets you the Sparkle Purse (NO DROP). She is a 4hour 15min
spawn with no placeholder.<br>
<br>
10. Return the Sparkle Purse to Noresa Sparkle and she gives you one of the keys
(NO DROP) needed to open the &quot;Gem Case&quot;.<br>
<br>
11. Find the Gem Case (NO DROP). It is hidden behind a lock door in the basement
of Hallard's Resales in E freeport (loc -100, -500) that you must pick. (Approx
119+ lockpick skill) It used to be guarded by a dog named Scrapps. Spawn time
and rate on case is unknown.<br>
<br>
12. Go back to Noresa and purchase off her a &quot;Sparkling Saphire&quot; (this
is the Gem Toxdil wanted) (Cost Approx 500-550pp, is NO DROP)<br>
<br>
13. Return this Saphire to Toxdil, and he gives you the other key (NO DROP)
necesary to open the Gem Case. Toxdil is in the Sewers under W FP. The entrance
is at the bend in the north side of the wall outside of the gate. Just look
around for him. He is not always spawned. He has place holders of a sewer rat
and a guard. He is not always in the same place, but often can be found in one
of the dead ends in the sewer or across from the stairs.<br>
<br>
14. Give the Gem Case and both keys to Bubar in the East Commons Tunnel to
recieve the Gem of Righteousness (NO DROP). The Gem of Righteousness looks just
like the sparkling gem bought from Noressa, but if identified is indeed the real
gem.<br>
<br>
15. Return both Gems to Ortalius, and reap the rewards.<br>
<br>
Burning Rapier<br>
7 damage, 23 delay<br>
Effect: Shock of Fire (15DD) - Level 4 wizard spell<br>
+5 dex, +5 agi<br>
NO DROP, Rogue Only<br>
Can be used in either hand<br>
Cannot be used in range slot<br>
Looks like an ordinary rapier (No special &quot;flame&quot; appearance or
anything)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="#FF0000">UPDATE!!!&nbsp;
The Burning Rapier has had a upgrade again!!&nbsp; It is now 7 DAM 20 Delay and
now does a 37DD proc.&nbsp; The other stats are the same except it is no longer
a light source.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Here are my screen shots from
the burning rapier quest I have so far.&nbsp; It starts in the Temple of Solusek
Ro with Lon the redeemed.&nbsp; I will add more as I get farther along.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">This is where the quest begins.&nbsp; Lon then
sends you to Conium Darkblade (the poison merchant) in Dagnor's Cauldron.&nbsp;
Below are the links to the rest of the quest.&nbsp; I personally did not do them
in order so some links will be missing until I get to that point&nbsp; *grin*</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">The brews are mostly pretty easy to come
by.&nbsp; The three tough ones are the Clockwork stout (found in SOL A), the
Blackburrow Swig (haha plan on a few days in Blackburrow) and the Blood Spirits
from mistmoore (dropped off a level 40+).&nbsp; After I got the clockwork stout
from SOL A I headed to Freeport to catch the boat to BB.&nbsp; Stopped off at
the sister island to get the Vasty Deep Ale, then hopped off the boat between
the stone pillars on the way to BB to get the oblong bottle.</font></p>
