<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Not too much going on here this
week.&nbsp; Of the course the usual business and even a little playtime!&nbsp;
Fixed the information on the fishing page and am going to start testing all the
broken armor recipes and see what ones work now (the old tailoring recipes for
studded and reinforced.)&nbsp; Working on getting some pics of all the dyes fine
plate armor so you guys can see what the different shades look like and
such.&nbsp; I hope to add a full picture gallery for it in the near
future.&nbsp; Just want to say thanks again for all the email,&nbsp; If I have
not responded I apologize.&nbsp; I am getting through as many as I can and
appreciate all the input!&nbsp; See you guys out there!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">October 7, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Okay, a few more changes for
you guys today!&nbsp; The new race specific armor has been updated and all
contain the correct recipes!&nbsp; Also added the Human (Freeport) recipes and a
few Wood Elf ones that I know of so far.&nbsp; The rest should be coming
soon!&nbsp; I am adding a fishing section to the site, it is in its VERY
preliminary stages but I have some zone specific fish you can catch and GET
THIS!&nbsp; You can tie your own fishing flies now!&nbsp; You can purchase a
tackle box on the Sister Island in the Ocean of Tears.&nbsp; So I have added a
few fly recipe there too!&nbsp; For all you wondering where to get your temper
ingredients, well they have been added as well.&nbsp; You can find them on the
brewing page and in the new armor guide to plate armor.&nbsp; Hope you all are
having fun out there!&nbsp; Keep sending in your requests, I am getting some
more web space now so I can expand a little bit here&nbsp; =)&nbsp; See you all
soon!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">October 2, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Talk about a busy weekend!!
WOW!!&nbsp; I have been getting a lot of email from you guys!!&nbsp; trying to
keep up with them all.&nbsp; There are additions to the brewing, smithing,
tailoring, foraging, and the new plate armor sections.&nbsp; I need to get a tag
to put on the new stuff so you guys can find them easier so I will start doing
that as soon as I make one!&nbsp; I am off to work so have a good one out there
and talk to you soon!&nbsp; I will reply to the emails as soon as I can
too&nbsp; =)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">September 27, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Whew!!!&nbsp; been a busy
week&nbsp; over here!&nbsp; I have been getting a lot of email for some
corrections on the tailoring page so they have all been fixed.&nbsp; Thank you
for all for making this site as accurate as possible.&nbsp; I popped into the
safehouse a few times this week to see how things were going and one of the
rogues there already finished the new epic rogue quest for ragebringer.&nbsp;
The weapon is AMAZING!!&nbsp; He posted on there about how he finished the quest
and gave a hint on how to start the quest.&nbsp; Well, of course he got about
500 tells in game and a ton of email about the quest.&nbsp; He then posted again
on the safehouse telling everyone to shut up, quit bugging him and all
that.&nbsp; I left a few replies saying well, what the heck did you expect and
of course it just turned into a huge rant from there&nbsp; =)&nbsp; So coming
here VERY soon will be the quest for Ragebringer for all you rogues interested
in the details.&nbsp; I want to do it very simillar to the burning rapier quest,
only problem is that you need to be at least 50th to do this new quest...so I
have quite a while before I can! Stay safe out there and I am off to work so see
you all soon!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">September 23, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Okay!&nbsp; Have most of the
updates in now.&nbsp; A few new brewing recipes for the new armor, some
tailoring bags have been added and the new race specific ogre and dark elf armor
have been added!&nbsp; I am going through a lot of email from you guys and have
a few corrections to add yet today!&nbsp; Need to get some housework done first
though&nbsp; *grin*&nbsp; should be up this evening.&nbsp; Have a great weekend
all and I may see you on Erollisi Marr sometime today&nbsp; WOO!&nbsp; I have
got about 150 emails about morning dew -- it is foraged in Greater Faydark and
here is a pic someone sent in!</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/morningdew.jpg" width="154" height="61"></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">I cut it down a bit but you get
the point.&nbsp; Elven Wine is trivial for me so if anyone finds out what it
trivials at I would appreciate it!&nbsp; Have fun out there!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">September 22, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Been a while since I updated
the site!! sorry about that my PC was down for about a week and I finally had
some time last night to get it up and running again!&nbsp; I have quite a few
updates I need to add tonight when I get home from work and thank you
for all the email about morning dew!!!&nbsp; hehe only got a couple *grin*&nbsp;
anyway, looks like some exciting times ahead for a lot of the trades
skills!&nbsp; Studs are now stackable so that will make the smiths and tailors
happy (not that smiths don't have anything else to be happy about!!)&nbsp; I
have a few more smithing recipes to add and a few corrections and additions on
quite a few pages!&nbsp; I should have it all set by Saturday the way my week
has been going!&nbsp; Have a great time out there guys and gals and we'll see
you soon!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">September 11, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">More goodies for you guys on
the brewing page and the baking page!!&nbsp; We now have the recipe for Brandy
on the brewing section and Wedding cake in the baking section!!!&nbsp; should
make those weddings a lot more fun now!!&nbsp; Also have some new tempers added
in the brewing section as well for the new smithing recipes!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">September 10, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well, I have been thinking long
and hard about this Morning Dew dilemma!&nbsp; I am starting to think that the
rumors are getting old and if this thing was able to be foraged, it would have
been by now.&nbsp; Verant has said that this is brewable NOW so this leads me to
believe that Morning Dew is something brewed in itself.&nbsp; The same way vodka
is brewed and used in may other drinks, I think morning dew must be brewed first
THEN used to create the elven wine.&nbsp; Just my opinion&nbsp; =)&nbsp; I am
trying to mix many things with pods of water and flasks of water to see if I can
get anything to combine...I don't know, fruit or berries...something!&nbsp; I'll
let you know if I find anything out!&nbsp; Hope you guys had a great weekend and
when morning dew finally rears it's ugly head, you will hopefully see it here
first&nbsp; *grin*&nbsp; stay safe all!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">September 7, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">A lot of new additions
today!&nbsp; Some new baking recipes, some new brewing things and A LOT of
smithing additions!&nbsp; Check out the new armor recipes section to see them
all.&nbsp; Almost all of these are on the test server only so nothing is
verified or on the live servers yet!&nbsp; I'll let you know as soon as I find
out though.&nbsp; Having a busy week so sorry for the lack of updates!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">September 2, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Yup!! It is good!&nbsp; Halas
Heaters and they produce 3 a pop!&nbsp;</font></p>

language page has been added and I am going to go and FINALLY check on that
Halas Heater recipe!&nbsp; I have received 3 emails already that say it is
good!&nbsp; It produces 3 but I don't know the trivial level yet!&nbsp; If you
find out please email me and I'll add it!&nbsp; A big thank you goes to </font><font size="4" color="#00FFFF">Apocnec</font><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">

all you smiths out there!&nbsp; This is just a rumor right now but there are also

forges going in to make the new armor so keep your eyes open around Norrath for
them!&nbsp; Kaladim, Ak'Anon, Qeynos are a few that I know of right now and a
lot of the supplies come from Steamfont in the 2nd windmill.&nbsp; I found some
info on the new ingredients and added it to the new armor page as well!</font></p>

section as it could be considered a trade skill on some levels!&nbsp; I should
have that up in a few days as well.&nbsp; Well, wish me luck!&nbsp; Need to go
over my notes and then drive an hour to the exam.&nbsp; See you soon!</font></p>

useful as the others!&nbsp; added a few things to the tailoring and smithing
page so if you are working on any of those skills check it out!&nbsp; I was
visiting the <a href="http://server3.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse">safehouse</a>
earlier and there is a thread with player pics and WOW!! we have some HOT rogues
in the safehouse!&nbsp; I knew I loved being a rogue for some reason&nbsp;

out there!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">August 25, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">The Baking page is coming
along good!&nbsp; I am getting ready to get it up there this weekend.&nbsp;
Thought I would have time to get it up this week but I have been studying for my
MS Enterprise test and not been on much.&nbsp; Hope you all are doing well, the
guild stuff has fallen behind a bit so I will be on this weekend and adding a
few officers.&nbsp; Stay safe and see you soon!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">August 19, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Managed to get a few free hours
today so I am working on the BAKING section of the page now =)&nbsp;&nbsp; I
never saw myself as a baker in the game but damn!&nbsp; This is a fun skill to
work on!&nbsp; Great for catering those guild parties and weddings too!&nbsp;
Anyway, I'll have most of it up tonight.&nbsp; I need to get a few images to
slap up there as well but I'll worry about that later.&nbsp; Hope that helps all
you bakers out there that wanted this!&nbsp; I see why there was such a demand
for it now.&nbsp; It really is a fun skill to learn!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">August 16, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Starting to get up to speed on
all the new additions!&nbsp; Lots of nice upgrades and goodies added over the
past few months!&nbsp; Tailoring recipes fixed and bandages added, able to brew
elven wine now, poisons got a HUGE upgrade, and rumor has it that all the smiths
will be going bonkers over the new fine steel armor that is up on the test
server right now!&nbsp; You can even forge it in different colors!&nbsp; pretty
exciting stuff for all the trades people out there!!&nbsp; I have got many
requests for a baking section here so guess what, Raul will begin his studies in
cooking and there will be a &quot;rough&quot; baking section here soon.&nbsp; I
am sure I will not master the skill right away but I will add what I can!&nbsp;
Thanks again for all the great email you guys!&nbsp; I have added some of your
names to the pages because I really do appreciate the info you guys
submit.&nbsp; Hope you guys are having a GREAT summer and I'll talk to you soon.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">August 12, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">WOW!!&nbsp; It's been 2 months
off and I am charged to be back!!&nbsp; Sorry for the long pause, I had a lot of
stuff going on these last few months and didn't have ANY time to give to EQ.&nbsp;
I hear there have been A LOT of changes since I have been gone!&nbsp; I know I
have a lot of catching up to do so I will get it done as soon as possible.&nbsp;
I have got a lot of email to reply to and for those of you interested in joining
the deadly blades, I'll be getting in contact with you soon!&nbsp; Good to be
back and thank you for all your input and updates!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">June 11, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Not too much going on this
week.&nbsp; I have been having some email issues with my webhosting site and
they can't seem to get back with me on why my email addresses are not working so
use the second one there until they can get things fixed.&nbsp; I am adding some
new Kunark maps this week so check out the maps section if you get a
chance!&nbsp; There are quite a few budding tailors out there as I am getting a
lot of email on tailoring!&nbsp; I will try and update that area with some
graphics and more info for you all!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">June 3, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">I am back!!&nbsp; Have some
free time FINALLY and am trying to get some things updated today.&nbsp; I have
added a few new links and updated the exisiting skills here already.&nbsp;
Brewing, Foraging, Pottery and Smithing have been updated.&nbsp; I added a new Foraging
page and am adding links to other great sites for the rest of the trade
skills.&nbsp; These are in my opinion the best sites for the trade skills I have
not yet worked on.&nbsp; I am adding new pictures to my pics page so if you guys
want to see yourself on here, send me a sig file or a pic of your character in .jpg
format and I'll get it up here.&nbsp; There are a lot of new things with Kunark
coming up everyday so I will get them updated as soon as possible.&nbsp; Hope
you all are having a great time out there and thanks again for all the feedback!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">May 19, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">This has </font><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">definitely</font><font color="#FFFF00" size="5">
</font><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">a crazy month!&nbsp; of course work is
taking up a lot of my time and getting ready to sell our house eats up most of
my free time.&nbsp; I have been in EQ I think 8 hours this entire month and that
includes a day I stayed home from work sick!&nbsp; I am hoping things settle
down here a bit so I can get back to doing the things I like to do!&nbsp; I just
got the new Flash program to make some goodies for the guild and for the
safehouse.&nbsp; Don't know when I'll have time to play with it but I hope
sometime soon!&nbsp; Hope you all are having a good time out there and I'll have
some real updates soon!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">May 1, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Well, here it is May ALREADY!!
The last month just flew by!&nbsp; I am going to try and get Pottery done and
add another skills section this month.&nbsp; I am sure there are going to be
quite a few additions to the trade skills in Kunark and as soon as I get my copy
I'll start letting you know what I find.&nbsp; I have heard many rumors but I
will not post them here until I can verify they are true.&nbsp; There are a lot
of exciting things coming up here.&nbsp; On a personal note, I think I am almost
the luckiest guy in the world!&nbsp; I was in Guk last night kinda bored so I
figured I would try and get a runed bone fork.&nbsp; I have never camped it
before so I THOUGHT I knew where the squire spawns.&nbsp; Well I yell to a
friend and tell him I have not seen a squire in almost 3 hours!&nbsp; He come to
see where I am at and starts laughing his arse off!&nbsp; He says he is on the
&quot;other&quot; side of this room!&nbsp; So I trot across that plank room and
sit on the other side.&nbsp; We waited for almost an hour and NOTHING spawned
where the squire does.&nbsp; He is bored by now so he takes off.&nbsp; Well, I
am not giving up that easy so I stick it out a bit.&nbsp; Finally and Gaz Knight
spawns and I kill it.&nbsp; Then like clockwork, 18 mins later another
Knight.&nbsp; He told me that about every 4th spawn is a squire so I am planning
on seeing my first squire soon!&nbsp; Well lo and behold a squire pops next WITH
the FORK!!&nbsp; I immediately slay his froggy arse and WOO!! got my new
toy!&nbsp; I have heard of agonizing camps for that stupid thing and that is
drops once every 24 hours!&nbsp; So I consider myself very lucky to camp the
wrong spot for 3 hours then have the spear drop 1 1/2 hours later.&nbsp; Anyway,
that out me in a good mood for work this week.&nbsp; Hope you all have a great
week out there too!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well on to the good
stuff!&nbsp; Hope you find some very useful information in here, I have a lot of
different info from other sites and tried to combine it all into one.&nbsp; Good
luck on those trade skills and I'll see you out there!</font></p>
