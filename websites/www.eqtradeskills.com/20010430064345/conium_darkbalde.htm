<p align="center"><font size="4">Conium is a dwarf rogue located on the island
in Dagnor's Cauldron.&nbsp; He is located at the highest point of the
hill.&nbsp; I was level 31 when I was doing this but lower levels may have some
problems.&nbsp; There are aqua goblins and rats running around the island.&nbsp;
The goblins left me alone but the rats always attacked me.&nbsp; They were diced
up pretty easily but stay on watch while you are doing this part of the quest.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">This is the note I got from Lon the redeemed
below.&nbsp; I hailed him first then handed him the note.&nbsp; Notice I have an
open slot in my main inventory.&nbsp; Make sure you have one open because Conium
will hand you an axe.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">There is the axe and he continues on with more
of the quest.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">Here are the stats of the axe</font></p>

<p align="center">I hope I can get some time on tonight.&nbsp; I will add the
next installment of the quest when I finish it.</p>
<p align="center">Of course HighHold Pass is my next destination so we can get
that box to put the booze in!</p>
