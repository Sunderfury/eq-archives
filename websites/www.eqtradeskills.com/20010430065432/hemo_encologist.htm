<p align="center"><font size="4">This is another tough item to get for the
quest.&nbsp; The Hemo Encologist is located in the inner courtyard of Castle
Mistmoore.&nbsp; It is right next to the fountain room.&nbsp; This is dangerous
because she has lots of friends with her in the courtyard.&nbsp; I got really
luck because a nice troll by the name of WAUKE killed the Hemo for me and let me
loot it.&nbsp; She had 2 blood spirits on her and bronze legs.&nbsp;
Unfortunately there were no other rogues in the zone to get the other spirits so
I think they rotted&nbsp; =(</font></p>
