<p align="center"><font size="6">Raul's Language Lessons Page</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">So you want to learn about advancing your
language skills, well you've come to the right place.&nbsp; I got a few requests
from players that wanted to see a language page as it could be considered a
trade skill and there is definitely some money that can be made from this
skill.&nbsp; The following is some information I have come up with in my
experience and info from a trade skills regular;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="5">Apocnec -- 21st Level Dark-Elf
Necro of Brell</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4">Because of him, this page is
going up!&nbsp; Here is his contribution;</font></p>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">First of all, there are four different classes (ie..
  how rare/common each language is)&nbsp; and these include Common, Uncommon,
  Rare, and Exotic.&nbsp; Each has their own price and, of course, rare and
  exotic are more pricy than the other two.&nbsp; Commons are sold for around
  10pp a piece, uncommons are sold for about 15pp, rares are sold for 25pp.&nbsp;
  Exotic are quite expensive, and I bought all of mine for 90pp a piece, but I
  sell them for around 50pp just because almost no one buys them for 90pp, so I
  think the listing price should be in that range.&nbsp; Also, you most likely
  know all about how to teach, learn, languages, but I will recap it just in
  case :)&nbsp; languages are learned by getting in a group with the teacher,
  and then having the teacher switch to the language that you bought (money is
  usually given beforehand).&nbsp; The teacher then makes a hotbutton (or in my
  case already has one) and this hotbutton has all of the lines filled with
  random sayings that start with /g.&nbsp; These lines should be as full as
  possible so that the language is taught faster.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; sometimes
  people give lower prices the higher your intelligence is, one would think this
  is a good idea beacase teaching a 155 int necro is MUCH faster than a 70 int
  troll warrior :)&nbsp; okay, the languages:&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Common:&nbsp; Elvish, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Halfling,
  Barbarian, and Erudian</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Uncommon:&nbsp; Thieve's Can't, Troll, Ogre,
  Lizardmen, Darkspeech, Tier'dal</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Rare: Elder Elvish, Elder Dragon, Old Erudian, and
  Dragon</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Exotic: Orc, Gnoll, Faerie, Goblin, Froglok, and
  Combine</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Now, I forgot to mention, there is one more
  language, Elder Tier'dal... This one sells for around 250pp+ since it is soo
  dang hard to find.&nbsp; As I find new information, I will email it to Raul,
  and if I find any fluent languists I will also contact Raul.&nbsp; I would
  also like to include the names of my teacher, in case you would like to post a
  list of languists.&nbsp; His name was Thorion, and he is a paladin (also on
  Brell), and again I am Apocnec, a dark elf necro lvl 20 at this time (although
  I hope to get higher...).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again it is a MORE than
  profitable trade skill, and since pure casters like me have a high int, It
  took/will take me about 550pp overall to become totally fluent in the
  languages of Norrath.&nbsp; Drop me a line if ya need anything else :) thanks,
  and good luck on the addition :)</font>

<p align="center"><font size="3">Now of course I can't leave it at that!&nbsp;
Here is a little bit I have added to Aponec's submission to help you along your
way to being a master linguist!</font></p>

<font color="#800080">Barbarian:</font> a rough language of the northern people&nbsp;<br>

<p align="center">Now, on to the nitty gritty.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">How to Train and Learn Languages in Norrath</font></p>
<p align="center"><br>
Let's say that Raul the Half Elf and Meurtos the Gnome want to meet and trade languages.  They get together in the same zone, preferably a very safe place such as a city, and group.
(I did a lot of my lessons near the Greater Faydark and Crushbone zone). They go to a zone boundary and, without crossing it, sit down facing each other next to the zone
line.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now, Raul must set up an &quot;auto-spam&quot; macro.  He does this by picking one of the buttons on the Socials menu and right clicking on it.  That brings up a new window with a name (which
Raul can change to &quot;auto-spam&quot; or whatever name he prefers) and five lines.
Raul should fill up all 5 of those lines with /groupsay statements such as:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
/g Let us begin our language lesson.&nbsp;<br>
/g my name is Raul and I'm a Half-elf.&nbsp;<br>
/g I get the girlies like no one else!.&nbsp;<br>
/g The woodies, the high ones, the dark ones too,&nbsp;<br>
/g And I'll leave the ogres and trolls to you..&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(a small poem by Raul)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Then Raul should drag this new Social button over to his hotkey box and drop it in an available slot.
Raul now has a hotkey which will /groupsay those five lines whenever he activates it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Next, while he is in windowed mode, Raul right-clicks on the chat window.  This brings up a new window which includes such information as which language
Raul&nbsp; is speaking. Raul left-clicks on the language until it cycles to "Elvish."  He then right-clicks on it to dismiss that new window.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Meurtos has been doing the exact same thing, except that he has selected
&quot;Gnomish&quot; as the language he will speak.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now the lesson begins. Meurtos and Raul begin to user their hotkeys (either clicking with the mouse or pressing the right numeric key, whichever you find more convenient) to
&quot;auto-spam&quot; each other with their respective language. Meurtos yammers at
Raul in Gnomish, and Raul chatters right back at Meurtos in Elvish.  While this is happening, lines of gibberish are filling up their chat windows so fast that there is no possibility of successfully using the /say or /tell commands, or hearing anything shouted or told or said to them.  This is why they need to be in a safe place (like a city); they cannot hear any warnings anyone tries to tell them, and moreover, if a monster does run up and start hitting them, they will not even notice until they see the change on their health bar.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is a way around this, however.  Simply go to the "chat filters" submenu of the "options" menu, and turn group chat off.  The you will not see the other person's
auto-spam, though your skill in that language will still improve.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
While the lesson is underway, each should see the message <font color="#0000FF"> "Your language skills have improved!"</font> appear in their chat window from time to time.  It is necessary to watch closely, as it scrolls off very quickly.  Eventually
Meurtos or Raul will stop seeing that message.  When that happens, he should stand up.  Standing up is the signal that the language lesson needs to stop at least temporarily.  Now both of them should cross the zone line.  Zoning is necessary because otherwise you will not be able to judge your progress.
If you check your skill level in the language window, it will still appear to be
at the same level UNTIL you zone.<br>
<br>
Once both of them are in the new zone, Meurtos and Raul should check their skill list to see how good they are at their new languages.  If
Meurtos's Elvish is now "Excellent" and Raul's Gnomish is also now "Excellent," then the language trade has been a complete success.  If that is not the case, then they need to sit down and repeat the process until they both speak the other's language Excellently.&nbsp;
You can of course do this with more than two people.&nbsp; You can have an
entire group and each learn 5 new languages at once!</p>
<p align="center">Hope that helps in your language endeavors!&nbsp; Please feel
free to send me comments or suggestions, I will be more than happy to add it to
this page!</p>
