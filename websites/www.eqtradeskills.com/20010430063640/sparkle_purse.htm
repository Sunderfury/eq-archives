<p align="center"><font size="6">The Sparkle Purse</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">This is in my experience so far THE hardest
part of the quest.&nbsp; I spent 4 yes FOUR days in Sol A trying to get the
Sparkle Purse.&nbsp; It is dropped by a level 32+ Dark Elf magician named Lynada
the exiled.&nbsp; She spawns every 4 hours 15 minutes and she does not have a
place holder.&nbsp; If you have some high level friends that can help you out
I'd get em.&nbsp; Not too many people know where she spawns (in the high shaman
room) and a lot of people that kill her have NO IDEA what the sparkle purse is
for.&nbsp; My second day in SOL A someone said that they had just killed her and
the purse was on her corpse (this is all in ooc so the whole zone can hear
this).&nbsp; When I get to the room, I do not see her corpse.&nbsp; I get a tell
from an idiot halfling druid that looted the corpse hoping to make a buck
selling the purse to me. (Another fine reason why I love druids and wizzies so
much, damn pharmers).&nbsp; So he realizes what an idiot he is when he finds out
it is no drop.&nbsp; Kept going in there to look for groups that were killing
her and asking for loot rights or getting in a group that could make our way
there to kill her.&nbsp; Third day got with a 50 wizard and a 48 bard thinking
woo!&nbsp; I am gonna get this badboy today.&nbsp; Well, we get right out side
the room and kill all the gobbies off.&nbsp; We are healing and medding when all
of the sudden the door flies open and a goblin wizard with a champion and a
priest come flying out and start WAILING us.&nbsp; Of course I die in like 10
seconds getting casted on and right after I die the wizzie hits the evac button
and they end up in Nek forest.&nbsp; I end up in HH Pass where I was bound and
had to run back to get my corpse.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">It is now the fourth day, I get home from work
and get down to business.&nbsp; There was a group of nice guys camping the high
shaman.&nbsp; GREAT!&nbsp; They all worked well together and they were keeping
the are clean of gobbies.&nbsp; So, we chatted for quite a while and they would
be more that happy to let me loot Lynada.&nbsp; I was a VERY happy camper at
this point.&nbsp; Well, they had been there for 3 hours before I got there and
no Lynada.&nbsp; 8pm no Lynada, 9, 10, 11 Hmmmm I swear she had a 4 hour 15
minute spawn?&nbsp; At 11:30 they needed to move on an apologized they couldn't
help out.&nbsp; I of course was very happy that they even tried to help so here
is the <a href="guys.htm">pic I promised you guys!</a></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">I stayed near her room so I could hear when she
spawned. mindnight, 1 o' clock&nbsp; gee, I have to work tomorrow but I am&nbsp;
NOT gonna log till I kill this inky! At around 2am, I am thinking maybe the zone
is screwed and this isn't gonna happen tonight.&nbsp; JUST as I am getting ready
to log I hear &quot;Lynada the exiled begins to cast a spell&quot;&nbsp; WOO HOO!!!&nbsp;
So I talk to a few people that are in the zone (about 7 at the time) and a monk
named <a href="danthorn.htm">DANTHORN</a> and a Ranger named <a href="mirkro.htm">MIRKRO</a>
said they would help.&nbsp; I went and got Danthorn at the Lava zone and Mirkro
waited near her room.&nbsp; Danthorn could not invis as he is a monk but could
feign death so it was slow going through all those gobbies and the way to
her.&nbsp; We finally got to the entry room, Dan pulled them out one by one and
then the moment of truth.&nbsp; Pop her door open and there was a shaman in
there with her and her pet.&nbsp; Mirkro pulled the shaman and we started
beating on it, then Lynada casted on Dan so we went to her.&nbsp; She dropped in
like 5 seconds!&nbsp; I could NOT believe it.&nbsp; Monks kick arse!&nbsp;
Mirkro dispelled her and she was no problem.&nbsp; Offed her pet, killed the
shaman and I got my sparkle purse!!!&nbsp; Here are the pics and I just wanted
to say, last night was a real eye opener for me.&nbsp; I know you can count on
your friends and guildmates but I had lost my faith in any other players.&nbsp;
A lot of bad experiences and getting dinked over.&nbsp; <a href="danthorn.htm">Danthorn</a>
and <a href="mirkro.htm">Mirkro</a> are the two BEST reasons why I love this
game.&nbsp; They did not know me, owe me, or should they even care that I needed
help.&nbsp; The point is that they BOTH unselfishly gave an hour of their gaming
time and the possibility of dying, to help and unknown rogue complete a quest
because he asked and needed help.&nbsp; They did not ask for money, no
nothing.&nbsp; They just did it.&nbsp;&nbsp; My hats off to you guys, that is
what Everquest is all about to me.&nbsp; If these guys ever needed anything, I
would give my life for them.&nbsp; Kudos Dan and Mirkro.</font></p>
