<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">I have been really busy getting
ready to start my new promotion at work so not too many updates so far&nbsp; =(&nbsp;
I have a few to add to the cultural armor and I got quite a few emails about the
skinning knife.&nbsp; I apologize for being an idiot and not adding it to the
tailoring page when I added it to the smithing page.&nbsp; Anyway, it is on the
tailoring page now so I hope that helps!&nbsp; Tomorrow is the big day so you
guys all enjoy your day off!!&nbsp; I hope to get a little bit of play time in
tomorrow!&nbsp; Stay safe out there and I wish you all a great Thanksgiving!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">November 18, 2000</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Well I have a free day FINALLY!&nbsp;
adding some new things and updates to the site today!&nbsp; still getting a lot
of great email from you guys, I really appreciate it and it makes the site all
the more accurate.&nbsp; There are still a lot of new cultural armor updates
going in so I am trying to keep up as best as I can.&nbsp; I may actually get
some play time in today so I can try some of these new ones!&nbsp; Unfortunately
I can't get all my characters to a master smith level to try some of these so
your input really does help!&nbsp; I am getting more webspace and I want to make
a contributors section where I will add the folks that have given me so much
input and a pic of their character.&nbsp; Send me whatever info you want listed
with your pic and you will get added to that area.&nbsp; Have fun out there and
keep the great info rolling in!&nbsp; I have been considering starting an
EZBoard message area for the site so give me some input if you think it will be
worthwhile.&nbsp; I know there are a TON out there already but I know it is
easier to post in a message forum than send me an email....I want this to be as
user friendly as possible and anything that will help you guys out, I am more
than happy to do.&nbsp; Have fun out there ladies and gents and thank you again
for making this a fun site!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Made some HUGE additions to the
New Smithing area and Tailoring sections!!&nbsp; also some new things for
smithing on the brewing page!&nbsp; Have the new Halfling and Wood Elf armor in
the tailoring section but they are not working at the moment.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">I also have a new guide to let
you all know about...I have not seen this myself but hear it is very good.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#00ffff">Greetings Fellow Everquest
Players,<br>
<br>
Finally we have completed our CD to help you master Everquest. In the<br>
making since June of this year, we bring to you EQMastery! The first EVER<br>
guide to be compiled onto a CD with information regarding everything you<br>
need to know about Everquest.<br>
<br>
On the CD:<br>
Zones with maps and detailed information like items, monsters and level<br>
range.<br>
Leveling the class you play most efficiently, not a general area for every<br>
class.<br>
Master the trade skill you want to learn with ease.<br>
A list of NPCs in every zone with info like Hitpoints, Lvl, Class and<br>
Location<br>
Over 2100 Items listed in the items section. Details on the item as well as<br>
where they can be found.<br>
The most unique Quest database ever. Over 600 Quests listed. Type the item<br>
you have, and it will find every quest related to it.<br>
Interested yet? Thats only a fraction of what we have compiled. Need help?<br>
We even have a person who has played multiple level 50+ characters to answer<br>
ANY questions you might have.<br>
<br>
Come check us out at www.EQMastery.com for more information. We have limited<br>
supplies so buy yours today!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">November 9, 2000</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">I am going to be out of town
all weekend, leaving tonight and getting back on Sunday.&nbsp; I'll get some
updates up here Sunday night when I get back.&nbsp; I know there are still a few
big things going in soon so I want to get caught up.&nbsp; Still getting a lot

<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">November 7, 2000</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Hey all!&nbsp; Been doing some
upgrading around here so sorry for the lack of updates.&nbsp; I just went to an
AMD 900 Mhz. Thunderbird and added a new SB Live 5.1 soundcard.&nbsp; Rebuilt my
hard drive because my performance was...well pretty crappy&nbsp; =)&nbsp;
Getting everything in order now and getting ready for a revamp of the site!&nbsp;
I have A LOT of email and updates to catch up on so I hope to add them soon!&nbsp;
Hope you all are having fun out there and see you soon!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">November 1, 2000</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Holy crap!&nbsp; Can you
believe it is NOVEMBER already!&nbsp; ack!&nbsp; I guess the patch got postponed
for a while so no new uber-weapons, no trade stuff added, and I was really
looking forward to seeing how DirectX7a was going to work with it.&nbsp; I guess
I can wait a bit...I hope to hit 40th level soon and I KNOW how long that is
going to take to get through that!&nbsp; I'll be doing all my skills again and
verifying broken recipes and all that good stuff.&nbsp; I added some things to
the fishing page and will be adding more to the new blacksmithing page.&nbsp;
Hope you guys are having fun out there and see you soon!</font></p>
