Updates</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">March 25, 2000</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">As you all know the guild is
going over some dramatic changes.&nbsp; This guild </font><font size="4" color="#FF0000">IS
NOT</font><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF"> disbanding and we are
restructuring.&nbsp; Flagge is taking a break from being the Guildleader for the
time being and has passed the reigns to me.&nbsp; This may only be for a
temporary amount of time but we will see.&nbsp; We are going to have an informal
meeting tonight, meaning we will have it in guild chat, you won't have to run to
any certain location.&nbsp; Find a safe spot and sit tight, the meeting will not
be too long.&nbsp; I am shooting for 6:00pm EST tonight (Sunday evening).&nbsp;
Hope a few of you can make it and we'll see you then.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">I am working on getting things
in order, I need to know who is still in the guild and who is leaving or has
left.&nbsp; I have made Chevalier De Blanc an Assistant Guildleader and we will
be meeting tonight to make some major decisions about the guild.&nbsp; I am
planning on keeping it a rogue/bard guild but we will form alliances with other
guilds so we can get a nice mix of classes to group with.&nbsp; The big thing is
communication right now.&nbsp; A lot of our current/past guild members do not
communicate information and with a guild especially it is VERY important.&nbsp;
If you have looked at the roster you know what info I need to update the
database.&nbsp; I also need to know what trade skills you have mastered.&nbsp; I
am redoing the roster so I really do need to know who is going to participate
and who is along for a free ride.&nbsp; If a free ride are your intentions, you
are in the wrong guild and may want to seek that elsewhere.&nbsp; If you are
serious about being in a guild, The Deadly Blades will be more than happy to
call you brother or sister and work together, for the whole and not
individuals.&nbsp; If you could let me know either way I would appreciate
it.&nbsp; I can be reached at <a href="mailto:raul@eqtradeskills.com">raul@eqtradeskills.com</a>
or if that address is not working <a href="mailto:oke@mediaone.net">oke@mediaone.net</a>&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The merits and awards database
is almost done.&nbsp; I will be posting that shortly and well as the hierarcy of
the guild so everyone knows where they are and where they can go.&nbsp; I am
also trying to add member pages, send in a description and a picture of your
character you want up on the web and people will be able to access your profile
from the roster page.&nbsp; I hope to have it up by the weekend.&nbsp; Hope you
all are doing well, for those of you staying, thank you for sticking this out
through some rough times and I promise things will get better.&nbsp; For those
of you leaving, I wish you all the best and if you decide to come back one day,
you are always welcome to return.</font></p>

that will be the individual classes with its own hierarchy, having 4 ranks to
move through. The entire tree will be posted very shortly.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Still trying to get some things
in order for the new guild format.&nbsp; Have not heard from many of you so if
you are still interested in being part of this guild drop me a line.&nbsp; We
are getting ready to get this thing rolling and it would be nice to get input
from the ENTIRE guild and not just a few people.&nbsp; I should be on a bit this
weekend so catch me then if you are on.&nbsp; I will be posting a guild meeting
shortly so check back here often.&nbsp; Talk to you all soon!</font></p>
