<p align="center"><font size="4">This was actually pretty easy.&nbsp; I had my
Lock picking skill at 121 when I attempted this and it opened no problem.&nbsp;
I walked in and the bag was there right in the middle of the floor.&nbsp; There
was no one guarding this and I was in and out in about 10 seconds&nbsp; hehe</font></p>
