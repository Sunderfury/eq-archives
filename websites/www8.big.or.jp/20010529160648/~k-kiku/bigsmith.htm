	<td colspan=2><font face="comic sans ms,arial,helvetica" size=-1>This building ROCKS, and in my opinion it is the best building in the game.  It is designed to be a retail shop.  Not only is the exterior door lockable, but if you open it, the door to the Patio can also be locked, so you can actually conduct business.  From the front Room, you can NOT teleport to any of the other rooms or the Patio.<p>
There is of course a downside...  Anyone can smelt their Ore on the forge from outside the fence, but they can not use the anvil.  If nothing else, you will have no shortage of ingots to buy :)<p>
You can NOT open a trade window across the counter.  If you want to conduct business from behind the counter, you have to do all your trades on the counter.<p> 
I have gotten a LOT of questions regarding this building.  (<i>Note from Den Dragon</i>: I've received reports that indicate that the price ranges from 33,344 to 38,000 GP. I've listed the most specific price that I've received so far above. As far as actually <i>finding</i> one goes... Well, good luck--you may want to try Skara Brae or Buccaneer's Den.)<p>
