      Kizrak the Tyrant, a champion of <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a>, settled down for the night on 
      a bed of concrete in <a href="oggok.htm">Oggok</a>, shunning creature comforts. He lay there in 
      the damp cold surrounded by dark stone walls with no blanket; no light. He 
      found solace in the irritation of the pinching plates of armour under his 
      back. <br>
      <br>
      As he did every night, Kizrak closed his eyes and relaxed his mind so he 
      could properly focus on his prayers. Having had an affinity for his god 
      for hundreds of years, he found it easy to sense <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a> as he prayed. 
      He fancied that, on occasion, he would have dialogues with his god.<br>
      <br>
      As the clammy world around him faded from awareness, he felt himself fall 
      into a state of ethereal openness. He freed his mind's voice and began his 
      prayer, asking <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a> for the strength to continue to help any chosen 
      <a href="warriors.htm">warriors</a> find their way to the Realm of Heroes through worship and war.<br>
      <br>
      As he recited the prayer, he felt something out of the ordinary. In his 
      mind, the vast universe that Kizrak prayed into began to close in on 
      itself. He felt a strong presence. A booming voice crashed through his 
      subconscious. It was <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a> himself. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;There is no longer a place for mortals in the hearts or minds of the 
      gods! The insolence! The arrogance of those that prayed to us and then 
      dared to enter our homes and attempt to kill us!&quot; the God of War bellowed. 
      &quot;We turn our backs on you foul mortals. We gave life. We imbued our 
      children with our own powers and we answered prayers. Well, no more!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;My almighty Warlord, what is your will? What would you have me do?&quot; 
      Kizrak asked through his thoughts. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;There is nothing to be done. We have chosen to ignore the prayers, the 
      snivelling, the begging,&quot; <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a> roared. &quot;Mortals believe themselves 
      powerful as gods, so much so that they challenge us. Us! So be it. If they 
      are so powerful, they have no need of us! Hence forward, the prayers of 
      our despicable children on <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> will be ignored!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      As quickly as <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek's</a> presence came, it left. Kizrak's mind was 
      immediately silent.<br>
      <br>
      Kizrak sat up with a start and opened his eyes. He knew all too well what 
      the ire of the gods could bring upon mortals. He had watched his own 
      brethren, the <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a>, reduced to slovenliness and ignorance for daring to 
      attempt to usurp the power of gods. <br>
      <br>
      The pantheon of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> had finally come to agreement on an issue -- that 
      the arrogance of mortals, their own children, must be punished. <br>
      <br>
      Kizrak, a devout <a href="warriors.htm">warrior</a>, wanted to let all of the foul mortals of 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> know what they had done. He left 
      <a href="oggok.htm">Oggok</a> that night and wandered into the
      <a href="feerott.htm">Feerott</a> toward someone he had all but forgotten.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Drizda Tunesinger, I have a message for you and the 
      <a href="league_bards.htm">Antonican bards</a> to 
      pass along to all Norrathians,&quot; Kizrak said.<br>
      <br>
      Drizda, a messenger for the <a href="league_bards.htm">League of Antonican Bards</a> for years, was 
      extremely taken aback. She had been dodging <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> bouncers for years in the
      <a href="feerott.htm">Feerott</a> while delivering messages. Now cornered by Kizrak, she was not 
      about to argue.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What words would you have me spread across the lands?&quot; she said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;You tell the arrogant and proud of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> that the pantheon is angry. 
      Mortals have become too bold in entering the planes of our gods. The 
      prayers of all Norrathians will no longer be answered. Mortals will be 
      punished for their arrogance,&quot; Kizrak bellowed.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This cannot be true! What of those who pray and give offerings to their 
      gods? What of the devout and loyal?&quot; Drizda wept.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;<a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a> himself told me. The actions of the many have outweighed the 
      efforts of the few. Tell them -- tell them all! The children of the 
      pantheon must walk alone,&quot; Kizrak said, abruptly turning and walking away.<br>
      <br>
      Drizda quickly journeyed to <a href="freeport.htm">Freeport</a> to tell Felisity Starbright about 
      Kizrak's news. Felisity considered the information for a moment and then 
      set to work to spread the news. She had already heard rumours that week 
      that some paladins in the Hall of Truth who called upon 
      <a href="mithaniel.htm">Mithaniel Marr</a> for 
      strength and guidance were getting nothing but silence in return. <br>
      <br>
      With great sadness and worry in her heart, Felisity could not deny the 
      validity of the tale. With the help of her students in the Marsheart's 
      Chords, over one thousand letters were crafted and put in satchels to be 
      delivered to every city in <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> by her network of 
      <a href="Bards.htm">bards</a>.<br>
