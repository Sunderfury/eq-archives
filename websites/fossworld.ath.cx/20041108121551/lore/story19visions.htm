      Under the flickering torchlight in the tunnel in the
      <a href="commonlands.htm">Commonlands</a>, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> 
      set his weary eyes upon his three new friends, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">
      Morden Rasp</a>, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria Debiean</a>, and
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal Di'Xevar</a>. Several days earlier, he sent 
      word asking for them all to meet. He had something to tell them. Something 
      important.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Thank you for meeting with me. It's wonderful to see us all together 
      again,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said with as much cheer as he 
      could muster. &quot;First, I want to thank all of you for taking me in, 
      especially in the raving and maddened state I seemed to be in.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, it weren't nothin' dear friend. Ye've set me and me friends on a 
      course we wouldn't dare dreamed of. And ye are lookin' a might better,
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Indeed. With time and <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> help, I've been 
      able to conquer my thoughts again. But, there is one vision that I can't 
      seem to suppress in any way,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said with 
      a worried expression.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> put a hand on his shoulder.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Don't be afraid to tell us what is on your mind <a href="Calliav.htm">
      Calliav</a>,&quot; she said. &quot;We are well aware by now that you are not the 
      madman you appeared to be. I believe all you say is true and I can 
      convince these other two of the same, no matter how much they may try to 
      taunt you with their poor humor.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> 
      looked at each other and shrugged, feigning ignorance. They both turned to
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and smiled, encouraging him to continue.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Well, as you know, in our search for the Grozmok Stone, adventurers all 
      over <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> are turning up strange minerals and 
      gems that appear to be imbued with varying powers,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">
      Calliav</a> said. &quot;I took it upon myself to start collecting them to see 
      if they were perhaps shattered pieces of the Grozmok Stone.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      As <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> mentioned the Grozmok Stone,
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> eyes became stern and
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> looked uncomfortable, shifting on her 
      feet where she stood. Tondal looked to <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      and <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> with a strange expression.
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> didn't seem to notice any of the tension 
      as he continued.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I noticed there is some kind of force that is created as more of these 
      materials are put close together, much like a magnetic force,&quot;
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> looked at his friends, his face set in a 
      sheepish expression. &quot;The stones seem to be acting like a compass of some 
      sort.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Sounds reasonable to me. What else? I can see there is more ye are wantin' 
      to say, friend. Of all the strange things we've discovered, I'd say this 
      one is a wee bit mild so far, eh?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      said reassuringly.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Well, that vision I mentioned? The one that won't go away? Well, I . . 
      .,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> voice trailed off and he stood 
      silent, his eyes cast to the floor.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Please <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>! You can't just leave us in 
      suspense. We trusted all you said before even though we were nearly 
      certain it couldn't be true. Trust us now else I go mad on you!&quot; Tondal 
      said, a dark-skinned smile spreading across his sharp features.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The truth is that we have barely scratched the surface I fear. While the 
      Grozmok Stone is still very important somehow, there is something else, 
      something dark on the horizon. I fear for <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. 
      I really do fear for us all,&quot; he said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What is it, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>?&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">
      Nedaria</a> asked. &quot;In our time together and all the times I've sensed 
      what runs through your mind, I've not seen anything that threatens all of 
      us.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;There is nothing to see <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>. No one has 
      ever laid eyes on this threat, this evil. I can sense it more than see 
      it,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said. &quot;<a href="zebuxoruk.htm">Zebuxoruk</a> 
      gave me this knowledge for a reason and I believe he intended for all of 
      us to prepare.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Prepare for what?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> asked.<br>
&nbsp;</font><p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;A war of the likes we have never seen. All 
      of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>, good and evil, must band together if 
      we wish to survive.&quot;<br>
