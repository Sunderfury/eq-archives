      A withered form stumbled about the <a href="pop.htm#Plane of Knowledge">
      Plane of Knowledge</a>, his feet dragging over the stone pathways. <br>
      <br>
      The agony and confusion the <a href="wizards.htm">wizard</a> felt in his 
      mind was embodied in his physical presence. His robe hung scruffily around 
      his frame and the tattered hem whispered as it trailed across the cobbles. 
      Strings of dark matted hair dangled around his face. <br>
      <br>
      At intervals, the wretched man, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav Giniuar</a>, had moments of clarity 
      and spewed broken words and splintered visions with a wild look in his 
      eyes. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Time! My lord in Time. . . We fail . . . dark days . . . shadows move 
      under Norrath . . . sands . . . a curse . . . the stone!&quot; he cried madly.
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> learned the legends about <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">Zebuxoruk, the 
      Forsaken</a>, when he was a small boy. As he grew older, his dreams and 
      hopes that the demigod <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">Zebuxoruk</a> could be 
      contacted and freed from his imprisonment in the Plane of Time became an 
      obsession. <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> awe of the knowledge that <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">
      Zebuxoruk</a> was thought to have was unbounded. <br>
      <br>
      Year after year, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> honed his meditative skills. He believed he could 
      reach <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">Zebuxoruk</a>, who he called his &quot;lord,&quot; 
      through a focused and loyal mind. <br>
      <br>
      After many years of practicing meditative arts, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> mind was able to 
      transcend his body and make contact with ethereal beings. Thus far, he had 
      never been close to feeling or seeing <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">Zebuxoruk</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Day after day, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> continued to refine his focus.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">Zebuxoruk</a> had felt <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> spirit some time 
      ago and believed he might make an acceptable repository for some of his 
      knowledge. Having been imprisoned in Time, <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">
      Zebuxoruk</a> felt a need to find a channel that would allow his grim 
      visions of the future to reach the citizens of <a href="norrath.htm">
      Norrath</a>. <br>
      <br>
      One fateful night, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> focused his mind with such great intensity that 
      the rhythm of his heart almost ceased. His breaths were long and deep. In 
      those moments, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> presence was palpable to <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">
      Zebuxoruk</a>, so he unleashed a fraction of his knowledge to the 
      determined mage's mind. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> was sorely unprepared, as any mortal would have been, to receive 
      such a flood of knowledge. His mind was blinded and unable to sort, 
      comprehend, and process. He opened his eyes, attempting to focus on a 
      stack of tomes in his dimly lit room and couldn't. Reality became clouded 
      by the unfathomable number of thoughts flitting across his mind's eyes.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> felt an urgency about the knowledge <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">
      Zebuxoruk</a> had given him. A need to prepare for danger grew in his 
      heart. Something dark and terrible was on the horizon -- something so foul 
      it was almost inconceivable. Logic crumbled. <br>
      <br>
      A vision of a magic stone pulsed inside <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>. He had to learn what it 
      meant. Had to.<br>
      <br>
      His mind screamed as his body tried to command his feet to take him to the
      <a href="pop.htm#Plane of Knowledge">Plane of Knowledge</a> for answers.<br>
      <br>
      He fell against the door of his modest room in the
      <a href="karanas.htm#West Karana">West Karanas</a>. Something ominous and evil prowled just beyond his 
      vision, choking his mind. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Doom,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;It could be the end of us all.&quot;<br>
