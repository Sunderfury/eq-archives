      Before recorded time, <a href="veeshan.htm">Veeshan</a> the great Crystalline Dragon marked 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> 
      by striking the      continent of <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> with her foreclaw, and deposited her brood there to 
      dwell. The legends       of that time also tell that <a href="veeshan.htm">Veeshan</a> blasted
      <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> with her breath, 
      encasing it in eternal ice and       creating a barrier of deadly ice flows and stormy weather. This marked the 
      beginning of the 
      <a href="ruins%20of%20kunark.htm#Dragons First -- The Age of Scale">Age of      Scale</a>. The 
      <a href="ruins%20of%20kunark.htm#Dragons First -- The Age of Scale">Age of Scale</a> lasted untold millennia. From the tidbits of 
      information passed down, it is       known that a group of dragons mastered magic and spellcasting during this 
      era. Additionally, dragons       of power and influence among their kind gathered together and formed a 
      hereditary ruling council       known as the <a href="CoV.htm">Claws of Veeshan</a>, who rule the dragons of
      <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> to this 
      day. Few of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>’s       inhabitants know more of this Age ,and none that do would dare to speak.
      <br>
      <br>
      The end of the 
      <a href="ruins%20of%20kunark.htm#Dragons First -- The Age of Scale">Age of Scale</a> was marked by the Gods creation of the other 
      races of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. Many of <a href="veeshan.htm">Veeshan</a>’s vainglorious brood perceived that they might rule over these 
      lesser beings and left <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a>.       This splinter group became known as the 
      <a href="ringofscale.htm">Ring of Scale</a>. Those dragons that 
      remained upon <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> had       little interest in temporal power, and were content to pass the millennia 
      in homage to their goddess,      and in quiet contemplation and the study of magics. <br>
      <br>
      In the 
      <a href="ruins%20of%20kunark.htm#Early Gods and Their Interventions -- The Elder Age">Elder Age</a>, the 
      <a href="ogres.htm">Ogres</a>, Giants and Goblins conquered much of 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> 
      and began an assault on the       <a href="pop.htm#Plane of Earth">Plane of Earth</a>, precipitating retribution from 
      <a href="therathe.htm">The Rathe</a> in the form of a 
      great curse against all of       <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a>’s creations. The fertile homelands of the Giants (now known as 
      <a href="everfrost.htm">Everfrost</a>) were frozen, and       those giants caught in the epicenter of the curse were transformed wholly 
      into immortal creatures of      living ice. Those nearby were struck to the core of their beings, becoming 
      lesser creatures in mind       and body than they had been. Those few who escaped the effects fled 
      <a href="tunaria.htm">Tunaria</a> for other lands, coming       to the attention of 
      <a href="prexus.htm">Prexus</a> the Oceanlord, who sent a great storm to 
      destroy them. The storm drove many      ships back to <a href="tunare.htm">Tunaria</a> and to 
      <a href="kunark.htm">Kunark</a>, where the curse of <a href="therathe.htm">The Rathe</a> took 
      hold to a lesser degree than in       <a href="everfrost.htm">Everfrost</a>. Many of the most powerful giants managed to escape the storm 
      thanks to their great powers,      and passed through the Frigid Barrier to land upon the Icy Fingers in
      <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a>. The Kromrif established       themselves in the Eastern Wastes and lived as nomads, eventually coming 
      into conflict with the <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a>.      The Kromzek were the most powerful of all 
      <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a>’s creations. Not 
      content with a nomadic lifestyle,      they established a mighty fortress city named Kael Drakkal in the Great 
      Scar of <a href="veeshan.htm">Veeshan</a>. The <a href="CoV.htm">Claws of      Veeshan</a> took exception to the intrusion of the Kromzek upon their sacred 
      lands, and thus began the       long conflict between the two mightiest races on 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>, in this most 
      inhospitable of all places.       Ages passed, leaving the eastern regions of
      <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> largely in the control 
      of the Giants. It was      during this time that the ships of the 
      <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a>, or Ice <a href="dwarves.htm">Dwarves</a>, were 
      wrecked upon the ice of the Frigid      Barrier. Those few who survived to reach the shore escaped the notice of 
      the <a href="CoV.htm">Claws of Veeshan</a>, but       were devastated in a conflict with the fearsome Kromrif. Fleeing the 
      giants, the <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> established
      <a href="thurgadin.htm">Thurgadin</a>, a hidden underground fortress in 
      the mountains. Since these times, none of the other races of
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> have dared to approach the Frigid 
      Barrier, and thus <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> remained undiscovered. <br>
      <br>
      In the present day, the <a href="gnomes.htm">Gnomes</a> of
      <a href="akanoncity.htm">Ak’anon</a> have revealed an ocean vessel 
      with the capability of       navigating the roughest seas and breaking through ice flows. Upon it’s 
      maiden voyage, the Gnomish       Icebreaker successfully penetrated the Frigid Barrier and discovered the 
      islands known as the Icy       Fingers. Upon the largest of the islands, the crew discovered an ancient 
      and massive bridge, which       arced away into the mists and revealed the tip of a massive glacial 
      continent – <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a>! For a price,       these 
      <a href="gnomes.htm">Gnomes</a> and their allies will offer the brave adventurers of 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> 
      passage to these frozen,      uncharted lands. <br>
      <br>
      You may be one of the first to explore this deadly and forbidding icy 
      land. Your feet may be the       first tread its deadly caverns and ancient shrines. If you are among the 
      stout of heart, you may       dare to enter <a href="velious_manual.htm">The Scars of Velious</a>. You are in our world now! <br>
