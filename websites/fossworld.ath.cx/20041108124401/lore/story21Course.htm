      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> groaned as he gently lowered 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav Giniuar</a> from over his 
      shoulders to soft grass under a tent, his arm and back muscles quivering 
      under the strain.<br>
      <br>
      It had been over a day travelling through the <a href="desertofro.htm">deserts</a>, 
      <a href="karanas.htm">Karanas</a>, and <a href="qeynos.htm#Qeynos Hills">Qeynos 
      Hills</a> to bring <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria Debeian</a> to their next camp in 
      <a href="nedarias%20landing.htm">Nedaria's 
      Landing</a>. For much of the distance, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal Di'Xevar</a> shared the 
      burden of carrying the comatose mage by making a hammock from bear hides. 
      The bear-hide tore in the <a href="karanas.htm#West Karana">West Karanas</a> and rather than wait to repair it, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> wanted to press on. Much work had to be done, he told them.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> walked along side them with her hand resting on 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> 
      shoulder. For many days, she tried to reach <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> who was lost in his 
      own mind. Several times, for a few fleeting moments, she felt a glimmer of 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> consciousness and kept losing him. She believed that if they 
      took <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> to the place where the boat was to be built, he might wake. 
      The boat was his idea after all. <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> didn't hold too much hope, 
      though, but thought it couldn't hurt to try it.<br>
      <br>
      With <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> restlessly continuing his sleep under the tent,
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> sat 
      next to him and shook her head dejectedly. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I'm going to give it another try while I have the energy,&quot; 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> said, 
      her eyes dull with the hopelessness of the task. &quot;Don't go far. With you 
      here, it may help draw him out.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;What? Ye want me to whisper in 'is ear? Tell me what ye're wantin' me to 
      do,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> grinned, trying to lighten the grave mood.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Both of you...sit down near me and hold his hands, one on either side,&quot; 
      she said.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> kneeled to the ground, his armour lightly ringing as plates shifted. 
      He looked indifferent about the whole affair. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> looked at him, his 
      left eyebrow raised to reveal an inquiring steely eye. Tondal felt 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> curiosity boring into him.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Everything will be okay. I know it will. He will come back to us,&quot; 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ye know, I get a wee bit sceptical of ye're comfort with all these 
      strange events we've been privy too, eh? Aren't ye a 
      <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elf</a>? Shouldn't 
      ye be all death and misery?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> nudged 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> with his elbow.<br>
      <br>
      Tondal sighed and smiled at <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I'm as different to the <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elves</a> as you are to the 
      <a href="rogues.htm">Rogues</a> of the White 
      Rose, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> expression went dark for a moment at the remark before he turned 
      to <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Let's get on with it then,&quot; he said.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> closed her eyes and rocked back and forth slightly, whispering 
      words that neither <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> nor 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> could understand. <br>
      <br>
      With a scarred and rough hand, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> squeezed 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> wrist. In an 
      instant, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> eyes opened, looking wild and frightened. He looked to 
      see the three leaders of the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> looking down at him.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Have I been gone long? I'm so glad you're safe. I could hear the 
      explosion...&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> coughed uncontrollably, his throat dry and 
      unaccustomed to use. <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> opened a flask of water and tilted it to
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> lips. <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> sipped some water, sat up, and looked around him 
      in disbelief.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Oh my. You're building it. Why you have faith in me is beyond my 
      comprehension...as are many things it seems. I have been less than stable 
      and reliable since we've met,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, true, but ye've never been wrong, friend,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> reassured.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;You must continue to build this ship that will be as grand as any city on 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. Do not underestimate the scale,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> urged <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, his face 
      lengthening. &quot;It was me that caused that explosion in the tunnel. I'm so 
      glad you're alright...but, I did learn that these stones and materials we 
      find with magical properties are very powerful when gathered in 
      quantities. Above all, I found they pull my mind in one direction...west. 
      We must find the Grozmok Stone. It is pivotal to this journey and this 
      magical ore somehow. Have you found...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> eyelids began to flutter and his chin dropped to his chest. 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>, having been listening to 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>, let her mind's grip on 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>slide. Before she should enter his mind to hold him awake, he was gone 
      again.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> face wrinkled with frustration, first at
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and then she 
      shot an icy look to <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We need to talk, now! Let's move from him. I do not want him to hear 
      this,&quot; she said strictly.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> looked at <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> with surprise. 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a>, always wise and keeping out 
      of tiffs between <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>, just shrugged back. All three moved 
      beyond earshot of <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> at the water's edge where the sea tickled the 
      shore.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I know exactly what <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> is talking about
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> said with 
      detectable frost.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What exactly do ye mean?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said cheekily, trying to bring a smile 
      to <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> face.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Stop it. This is no time for jokes,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> scolded him. &quot;That feeling 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> had of having his mind pulled in a direction...&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;What of it, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>. Spit it out, hm?&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I had that very same feeling myself once,&quot; she continued. &quot;It happened 
      when I was in the presence of the Grozmok Stone.&quot;</font><br>
