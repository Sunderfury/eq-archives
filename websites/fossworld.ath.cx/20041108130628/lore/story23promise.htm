      As the waves gently caressed the shores of 
      <a href="nedarias%20landing.htm">Nedaria's Landing</a>, the calm, 
      rushing breeze was shattered by the hammering and clanging of the 
      <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> building the grand ship that would take them across 
      the turbulent <a href="abysmal%20sea.htm">Abysmal Sea</a>. <br>
      <br>
      Under a tent at the brotherhood's camp up on the grass, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> 
      explained to <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav Giniuar</a> how he and 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> came across the Grozmok 
      Stone. He hoped his mage friend would understand and forgive him for not 
      telling him he had the very thing that <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> had been seeking all of 
      these months. <br>
      <br>
      The tale <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> told was a lengthy one, beginning long ago.<br>
      <br>
      In the Monument Age, a <a href="trolls.htm">troll</a> named Zraxth had a vision that saw the coming 
      of one great and powerful <a href="trolls.htm">troll</a>, called the Grozmok, who would unite all 
      of the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> in <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> with the aid of the power in the Grozmok Stone. 
      The Grozmok would unleash terror across <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. <br>
      <br>
      Over a period of years, the stone changed hands many times. First, the 
      stone was stolen from the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> in the 
      <a href="innothule.htm">Innothule Swamp</a> by the Rallosian
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a>, and then stolen by the Ykesha Clan of 
      <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a>. Another faction of 
      <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a>, Clan Broken Skull, did not believe the Ykesha Clan were destined 
      to produce a <a href="trolls.htm">troll</a> strong enough to become the Grozmok and overpowered the 
      Ykesha Clan, killing their leader and taking the Grozmok Stone. <br>
      <br>
      Some time later, when the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> in the swamps of 
      <a href="antonica.htm">Antonica</a> re-established 
      themselves in <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a>, they robbed Clan Broken Skull of the stone once more. 
      Then, the Broken Skull Clan returned again and took the Grozmok Stone -- 
      its last known resting place.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria Debeian</a> had been sailing the fog-suffocated seas near 
      the <a href="gulf.htm">Gulf of Gunthak</a> on the Thorn of the White Rose when they heard that 
      Clan Broken Skull invaded <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a> and took the Grozmok Stone. <br>
      <br>
      In all of their adventures over the years, the story of the Grozmok Stone 
      surfaced several times. Both of the seafaring friends were well aware of 
      what the stone represented and that it might be capable of shifting the 
      weight of power in <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> vowed to find the Grozmok Stone and 
      hide it forever to keep all of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> safe from the rule of evil gods.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> 
      and a small crew of seven trusted adventurers sailed into the
      <a href="gulf.htm">Gulf of Gunthak</a> hidden by a thick veil of fog. 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> sat up on 
      the bow with her mind keenly focused, eyes closed. It wasn't long before 
      she opened her eyes and nodded to <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;They are close. Everyone should be at the ready,&quot; 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> whispered, her 
      words gliding on the heavy, still air. &quot;They have it -- they have the 
      Grozmok Stone.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      In minutes, the crew of the Thorn of the White Rose heard the unmistakable 
      creak of a strained hull rolling lazily through the water. 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> crouched, ready to spring as soon as the approaching boat crossed the bow 
      of his ship. Two crewmates waited behind 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, waiting for his commands.<br>
      <br>
      The figure of a rickety ship with tattered sails emerged from the fog, 
      eerily outlined like smudged charcoal on a grey canvas. Shadowy hulking 
      figures moved about the boat -- clearly <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> -- who did not notice the 
      ship coming into view on their starboard side. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> turned to the two behind him and nodded, pointing to the midship 
      rail on the <a href="trolls.htm">troll's</a> boat. His crew nodded and waited for 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> first 
      move.<br>
      <br>
      The decrepit boat inched past the bow of the Thorn of the White Rose. When 
      the boat was in position, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> silently leapt from the bow of his boat 
      onto the railing, staying perfectly balanced on the three-inch rod of 
      rusted iron. His crew followed. They all kept low and moved silently until 
      they were close enough to smell the rotting reek of <a href="trolls.htm">trolls'</a> breath.
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> crew flanked him.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> jumped down from the upper deck into the cockpit at the stern of 
      the vessel and let loose a mighty bellow. The shock of his yell stunned 
      the ten trolls that milled about the boat long enough for the blades of 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and his crew to reduce them all to heaps of blood and gore.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ye stay 'ere, hm? Keep an eye on things while I go take a look in 'er 
      hold,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said to his crew. &quot;Yell if ye see something odd.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      In less than a minute, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> returned with a grin. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;How blasted stupid do ye have to be to 'ide a big bloody slab o' stone in 
      burlap?&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> grinned to his curious crewmates. &quot;There it were, standing 
      right in front me. Gonna need some 'elp luggin' it o'er to me boat.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      After the Grozmok Stone was safely hidden on the Thorn of the White Rose, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> made his crew promise never to speak of it again. The stone was 
      never to be sold or uncovered lest it unleash a power that could bring 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> into the hands of the evil gods and races.<br>
      <br>
      As Ro, the Norrathian sun, began to set in <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's Landing</a>, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> uttered the last words of his tale to 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and gave him a few moments 
      to consider it all.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ye 'ave to understand <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>... I 'ad no idea who ye were or what ye 
      were about,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said, looking up into 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> eyes. &quot;I didn't want 
      to put the lives and fates of many Norrathians in your 'ands.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;It's okay, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. I understand your reasons now,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said, pausing 
      to think before he spoke again. &quot;There is more to the Grozmok Stone 
      prophecy, though. While the legend says that stone could bring power to 
      the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a>, <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">Zebuxoruk</a> showed me it will do much more. That stone may very 
      well change the face of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. Just look around... we have <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> working with 
      <a href="halflings.htm">halflings</a> and light <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> working with dark ones.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, true,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said with pride. &quot;But what of the Grozmok -- the one 
      <a href="trolls.htm">troll</a> that would unite all <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> and unleash havoc across the lands?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I believe the stone could give the Grozmok power, but now is not that 
      time,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said. &quot;The stone has changed over the years somehow and has 
      an even greater purpose than everyone originally thought. I believe the 
      stone will lead us to the evil power I've seen in my visions that could 
      topple all of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> -- <a href="trolls.htm">
      troll</a> and all races alike. But, I need to study 
      it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Just then, two of 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> most trusted friends laid the Grozmok Stone 
      next to <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>.<br>
