      The ravings of a mage called <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav Giniuar</a> who 
      has foreseen a great and dark land across the turbulent waters of
      <a href="abysmal%20sea.htm">the Abysmal Sea</a> have been recorded. His 
      ramblings were refined and his descriptions were sketched.
      </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">What resulted were outlandish stories and 
      creatures that no Norrathian could believe or conceive. Calliav believes 
      there is an army called the Legion of Mata Muram waiting for
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> to greet it. As a result of
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> rants, he was labelled a madman once 
      again for spouting such terrifying untruths. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">For your entertainment, we'll show you a 
      few of the mage's descriptions of strange beasts with accompanying 
      drawings that he had a painter make under the light of a torch on a dark 
      night when he awoke from one of his strange visions... </font>

      <a name="1. The Aneuk -- Priests of the Legion of Mata Muram">1. The Aneuk 
      -- Priests of the Legion of Mata Muram </a></font></b>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The Aneuk originate from a world of pure 
      magic. These priests are the most powerful of their world, having 
      channelled the strength of a god of darkness unlike anything Norrathians 
      have seen. They have the unique ability to cause as much harm as they can 
      heal. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">While the Aneuk excel with magic, they are 
      physically weak. Over the centuries, what used to be legs that carried 
      them as bipedal creatures have become nothing but dangling, atrophied bone 
      and flesh, since levitation is now used for travel. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">To protect their fragile bodies, they wear 
      armour inscribed heavily with glyphs that give added protection and 
      strength. The glyphs associated with their god also aid them in focusing 
      and channelling their magic across realms and planes. The race is 
      extremely ancient, having seen many battles won and lost on many worlds.
      </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">They are highly intelligent, and proudly 
      display on their armour the skulls of kings and leaders they have 
      conquered over the courses of their long lives. When the Legion of Mata 
      Muram arrived to decimate the home of the Aneuk, they were given a choice 
      -- die or join. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">As the Aneuk thrive on power, torture, and 
      conquering, several believed they would find a suitable home among the 
      dark creatures of the legion. The Aneuk are not only on the fields of 
      battle. There are several levels of the Aneuk that not only have unique 
      magic, but also serve special functions for leaders within the Legion of 
      Mata Muram. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">They are adept at organizing and 
      strategizing. </font>

      <a name="2. The Kyv -- Hunters of the Legion of Mata Muram">2. The Kyv -- 
      Hunters of the Legion of Mata Muram </a></font></b>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The kyv come from a land of complete 
      darkness which has made them ideal hunters for the Legion of Mata Muram. 
      They hunt using their senses and can track heat signatures and ultrasonic 
      waves. They are incredibly stealthy, and have unequalled skill with bows 
      and arrows. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Their origins are mired in sadism. In their 
      youth, the skin covering most of their body is branded with a white-hot 
      blade. The markings on their skin indicate their ancestry and rank in the 
      social order of the kyv. These tribal burn patterns made of scar tissue, 
      with little or no blood flow, also act as camouflage in worlds where 
      creatures hunt by heat signatures. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The kyv have a rich heritage of gladiators 
      and hunters. Their entertainment was not presented in coliseums, but in 
      the dark, dangerous wilds of their home world. The hunter was the hunted 
      -- kyv against kyv. It was a brutal and dangerous game that brought death 
      to the loser. The kyv do have the ability to use magic, but it's used 
      almost exclusively to charge their arrows. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The type and nature of arrows displayed 
      protruding from their armour are not just symbols of status, but ability. 
      The higher the rank and status, the more powerful the devastation 
      capability of the arrows in the back slots in their armour. While the kyv 
      are master archers, they can also hold their own using daggers and short 
      swords. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The recruiters of the Legion of Mata Muram 
      convinced many kyv to sign up. In fact, it was seen as an honour to be 
      recruited. Even as one of the lowest ranks in the legion, the kyv are 
      proud and pleased to wreak havoc on all who oppose them... </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The one drawback of joining the legion was 
      the inevitable: contact with worlds of light. As a result, all of the kyv 
      that were in the legion, and bred for the legion, stitched their eyes in a 
      great ceremony. The stitching of the eyes prevents them from the pain and 
      distraction of light in other worlds and indicates ascension on the path 
      to becoming the ultimate hunter. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Upon a victory in battle, most will remove 
      the eyes from their victims and hold them as trophies. </font>

      <a name="3. The Ukun -- War Hounds of the Legion of Mata Muram">3. The 
      Ukun -- War Hounds of the Legion of Mata Muram</a> </font></b>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">A captive ukun is virtually untameable, 
      even on its home world. Captivity quickly leads an ukun to a violent and 
      volatile mental state. They can only be taught simple commands, like 
      &quot;kill,&quot; or &quot;find.&quot; Ukun are often used as hunting animals by dominant 
      races. The biggest problem with the ukun when used as a hunting animal is 
      that they do not retrieve much.</font><p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">&nbsp;The ukun handler is invariably left 
      with only bones from a catch. Each time an ukun enters a world with light, 
      they violently react to it by clawing at their eyes until the pain, and 
      for that matter, their eyes, are gone. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Fortunately, the ukun can regenerate their 
      eyes, but only in the total absence of light. They can easily hunt without 
      sight as they are sensitive to heat, sound, and the movement of air across 
      their sensitive skin. When the legion herded up several of the ukun for 
      its use, they adorned the beasts with a leash and armour that would serve 
      as control mechanism with pins that dig into the flesh. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The pale skin of the ukun was then branded 
      with the markings of an unknown magic that provided their fragile skin 
      with some protection. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The ukun are savage creatures that can hunt 
      in packs, eating their enemies alive.</font><br>
