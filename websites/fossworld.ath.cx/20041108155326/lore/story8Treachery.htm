      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The rumours and riddles about trouble within the <a href="sarnak.htm">
      Sarnak</a> fluttered about like seeds on the wind. Finally, a few began to 
      take root. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> had faith that at 
      least some of the rumours had foundations in truth and he made it his 
      business to find out if they were.<br>
      <br>
      As <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> bought pieces of information about
      <a href="chardok.htm">Chardok</a>, he also appeared to purchase a loyal 
      following of like-minded adventurers. His wily charm afforded him low 
      costs and simple agreements to share in the adventure of infiltrating the
      <a href="sarnak.htm">Sarnak's</a> domain. Making such arrangements was 
      second nature to the seasoned rogue. His years of travel and constant 
      adventuring aided <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> in establishing a 
      small, but relatively loyal following. The bulk of this band was waiting 
      in <a href="freeport.htm">Freeport</a>, resting after a round of 
      excursions through the Buried Sea and nearby gulf.<br>
      <br>
      A shapeshifter was at work; that there were traitors within the highest 
      ranks of the <a href="brood%20of%20dizok.htm">Brood</a>; high-ranking
      <a href="sarnak.htm">Sarnak</a> citizens had disappeared inexplicably. The 
      information was hard to piece together, the puzzle incomplete.<br>
      <br>
      While <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> vanished for hours at a time, 
      scouting the area and seeking news, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> 
      spent much of her time near the campfire deciphering notes and letters 
      that had been trickling into the camp from hired spies. She made time to 
      teach <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal Di`Xevar</a> the basics of several 
      languages, like those used by <a href="gnomes.htm">Gnomes</a> and the
      <a href="highelves.htm">High Elves</a>. In return, <a href="tondal.htm">
      Tondal</a> occupied <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> with stories of 
      mischief about his youth, his <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elf </a>
      brethren and their escapades around <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. The 
      loyalty between <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, <a href="nedaria.htm">
      Nedaria</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> grew quickly and was so 
      strong it was felt by all who encountered them. <br>
      <br>
      It had only been a few nights since <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      invited <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> to the fireside. That night, in 
      dark speech, the three shared their lives and dreams until the glow of 
      Drinal gave way to the rays of Ro. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> felt tied to this
      <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elf </a>&nbsp;who shared their adventurous 
      spirits and lives as exiles. They felt closer than family, joined by their 
      very souls for a great purpose. <br>
      <br>
      They each knew that the time to lead their growing band of adventurers 
      into the nearby <a href="burning%20woods.htm">burning woods</a> was 
      closing quickly. <br>
