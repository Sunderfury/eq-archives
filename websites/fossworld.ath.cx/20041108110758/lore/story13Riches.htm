      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The strong rule the weak. That is the law 
      amongst the kobolds. But in the depths of
      <a href="solB_nagafens%20lair.htm">Lord Nagafen's lair</a>, one of the 
      strongest of the Solusek kobolds grew restless.<br>
      <br>
      While kobolds do not usually give in to pride, some do indeed give in to 
      greed. <br>
      <br>
      Heili Erat, a noble of the Solusek kobold clan, grew increasingly angry 
      that he was left on the fringe of the royalty. The rewards he sought for 
      his position were ignored. No matter how he petitioned for an army of his 
      own, he was shuffled back to his filthy room, where he could often be 
      heard pacing back and forth while cursing them all.<br>
      <br>
      Heili decided it was time to seek power and riches of his own. He would 
      find a way to line his pockets with gold. <br>
      <br>
      For as long as Heili could recall, he had been told to stay away from
      <a href="nagafen.htm">Lord Nagafen</a>, the mighty dragon in the bowels of 
      the mines. He was told never to explore there or he would face the dire 
      lord's fiery breath. The legends say that those who attempted to slay the 
      dragon were stripped of all their riches and wasted away deep in the 
      caverns -- a place no Solusek kobold had ever set foot.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than get the tangled fur of his own haunches seared by
      <a href="nagafen.htm">Lord Nagafen</a>, he decided to send an unsuspecting 
      slave. He called a kobold slave to his shabby room and had him sit in 
      front of him. The noble quickly cast a charm spell upon the poor slave, 
      bidding him to search the deep caverns of
      <a href="solB_nagafens%20lair.htm">Nagafen's den</a> to see what lay 
      hidden there. <br>
      <br>
      It is not known what the enchantment was that captured the slave, but it 
      was somehow enough for him to catch a glimpse of a cavern filled with 
      enormous heaps of riches belonging to <a href="nagafen.htm">Lord Nagafen</a>. 
      Heili saw it all as he looked through the slave's eyes.<br>
      <br>
      That was the tale woven by the Shadowed man to <a href="nedaria.htm">
      Nedaria</a> who, in turn, relayed it to <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a>. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      believed the tale. The creases at the corners of his eyes crumpled as he 
      smirked, his grey eyes glistening with the thrill of adventure. <br>
      <br>
      Two nights had passed and <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> had finally 
      reached the Solusek kobold's lair, where he perched on a ledge near a lava 
      pit. He heard them growling about a hidden passage and the noble's idiocy. 
      They said he was starting rumours and saying that
      <a href="solB_nagafens%20lair.htm">Lord Nagafen's lair</a> was not real.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the shadows, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> made time to watch 
      Heili, the noble. He saw him caress an old crate on the floor of his 
      makeshift room and cackle. He got up and paced past the torch on the wall 
      and its flame flickered. It was enough to capture a glint of gold between 
      the rotting wooden slats of the crate.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;There are riches of the likes we've never seen, my dear friends. I'm sure 
      of it,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said with a roguish grin to 
      the members of the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> 
      camp. &quot;I've found a way for us to enter the hold. Prepare yourselves for 
      adventure. We move today!&quot;
