      The brilliance of the crimson light in the sewers began to fade and a 
      feeble, robed figured took an unsure step forward.
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> moved out of the shadows and was taken 
      aback by the look of recognition on the mage's deeply creased face. <br>
      <br>
      The mage extended a thin, trembling arm as his eyes rolled back into their 
      lids. The weakened man's knees gave way and he started to fall to the 
      grimy floor. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> lunged forward with 
      striking grace and speed, catching the mage before his head hammered the 
      ground.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Well, how do ye like that for a greetin'? I usually have to work a wee 
      bit before folk fall to my feet,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      cracked wise to <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It is amazing to me how easily you amuse yourself,
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said 
      as he winked.<br>
      <br>
      The two collected the frail, shallow-breathing <a href="human.htm">human</a> 
      and rested his back against the slippery wall. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">
      Morden</a> looked him over.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I believe this be 'im, eh?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> asked, 
      looking to <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> for confirmation.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;He certainly did seem to have issue with his faculties. I would guess it 
      is <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav Giniuar</a>,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> 
      replied.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Get yerself back to the <a href="lavastorm.htm">Lavastorm Mountains</a> 
      and tell <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> to collect the
      <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers</a> and meet us in the
      <a href="commonlands.htm">Commonlands</a>. There be an old swashbuckler 
      there that will put us up for a while. We simply can't take this poor lad 
      to that infernal place,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We shall meet you there soon, friend. Be safe,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">
      Tondal</a> said and hesitated a moment before he spoke again. &quot;It may just 
      be my excitement, but I think this meeting will be of great importance to 
      all of us.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> looked at <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> 
      and nodded quietly.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, it may be.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> turned and disappeared into the night 
      outside the sewers.</font><p>
