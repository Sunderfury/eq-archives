      An unnatural fog fills the small cove. It brings with it a numbing quiet, 
      which is only broken by the rhythmic sound of waves washing against the 
      shore and slapping the hulls of several small wooden skiffs. The cove is 
      devoid of life, since most of its typical residents have moved aside to 
      make room for the chilling fog. The morning sun will eventually rise, and 
      the cove's residents will return to their swampy homes. Yet, these things 
      will all wait until the fog has receded to the ocean, carrying its dark 
      cargo with it.<br>
      <br>
      For now, the fog continues to creep up the shore and into the marshlands 
      that lay beyond. The small cove fills with dozens of wooden skiffs. The 
      small boats seem to cut through the water in almost perfect silence, 
      relying only on magic to propel them ashore. A single figure in each rises 
      and pulls its dark hood over its smooth, finned head. One motions toward 
      the dense swamplands to the east. The strange figures seem even more out 
      of place silhouetted against their bulkier, less agile
      <a href="trolls.htm">troll</a> allies; yet their authority is 
      unquestioned.<br>
      <br>
      The <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a>' push quickly through the low tangles 
      of the swamp, their savage strength easily clearing a path. It has been 
      some time since they moved through terrain such as this. Their clan has 
      long avoided this place, but today's activities should remove those old 
      fears. Once they have acquired the stone, the tides will quickly bring a 
      new era with them from Broken Skull Rock.<br>
      <br>
      As the groups reach a clearing near the city of <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a>, 
      they are brought to a sudden halt by the figures that lead them. The robed 
      creatures gather near a small pool. A grotesque webbed hand draws back the 
      robe's hood, revealing the amphibian's face.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Prepare your soldiers,&quot; the strange amphibian says softly, addressing the
      <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> in their guttural native language. &quot;The 
      doorway we create will not last long and we must have time to follow you 
      in... unless you wish for us to leave you inside with them.&quot; The creature 
      pauses, a slight smirk appearing on its face. &quot;This is not your desire, 
      correct?&quot; A defiant grunt is its only answer.<br>
      <br>
      The largest of the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> turns to face his 
      soldiers as the robed Luggalds begin their incantation. All around them, 
      the ankle-deep water comes alive with energy. A small growl surges from 
      within the ranks of the Luggalds to become a cacophony of battle cries. 
      The water before the sorcerers rises in a tall, thin sheet of water. 
      Through the portal can be seen a large wooden bridge, the surprised faces 
      of several guards and, just behind them, a sign that reads: Night Keep.<br>
      <br>
      As the last of the invaders climb out of the moat, which acted as their 
      entrance into <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb's</a> fortified walls, the raid's 
      leader shouts, &quot;We only leave when we have the stone! Once you have it, 
      burn everything else!&quot; This command echoes through Night Keep's halls, 
      barely audible over the crushing sounds of combat and the surprised cries 
      of unsuspecting guards.<br>
      <br>
      The <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a>' cruel nature is apparent as both 
      sides of the battle paint the scene in the savage reds of death and 
      flames. The <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> of <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a>, 
      now fully aware that the unthinkable is in progress, drive the invading 
      clan back to the moat. The clan from Broken Skull Rock, however, has what 
      it came for, and its members fight their way into a position surrounding 
      the crimson moat. From within the cramped formation the murmurs of 
      despicable incantations begin again.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Your lives, for the fulfillment of prophecy,&quot; a voice shouts from within 
      the dense circle of raiders. A shimmering red portal rises from the moat 
      below, engulfing the Trolls and their foul mentors. Those Broken Skull 
      trolls left behind perform their task well and thwart any disruption to 
      the clan's escape. Even as the portal collapses back into the moat, the 
      thieves are well on their way back into the fog that surrounds the cove.<br>
      <br>
      The morning sun is now rising, finding the wind pushing a strange fog and 
      several large ships to the west. This same wind carries a cargo of smoke 
      and confusion through the swamplands of Innothule. The fires in
      <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a> are extinguished, and the descendants of 
      Ykesha prepare for war.<br>
