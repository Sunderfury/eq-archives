      With his back lightly scraping against the stone of a sheered cliff, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> inched his way around a corner, careful not to attract 
      attention. His arm was lightly bleeding from a skirmish with the Muramites 
      moments before and it smeared the rock with blood as he moved.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Get back here, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. Those hounds are going to smell that blood in no 
      time at all. Are you mad?&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal Di'Xevar</a> whispered sternly.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Blast! When did that happen? I'm so darned tired, 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a>,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> sighed. 
      &quot;Feels like we've been fightin' constantly for days. Let's rest back here 
      for a while. The patrol we just got through shouldn't be missed for a 
      while . . . I 'ope.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Look at us, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. Looks like we should be dead ourselves. My armour is 
      just bathed in the dark blood of those evil creatures,&quot; 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> grimaced.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;<a href="darkelves.htm">Dark elf</a>, should you not revel in war and spilling blood? That's what I 
      was always told about you folk,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> grinned.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;That's hardly funny <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. I've seen enough death, and undead for that 
      matter, to last many lifetimes, even before I met you,&quot; 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said. &quot;My 
      heart is not as black as my brethren. I do not yearn to see blood. I can't 
      explain it other than to say that fate gave me a different heart to serve 
      a greater purpose.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;There ye go again with yer fanciful dreams. Hmph,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said as he 
      nudged <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a>, his armour grinding as it shifted. &quot;Whatever it is or 
      whoever it was that made ye what ye are, I'm grateful . . . just shut up 
      about fates, will ye? Nonsense.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Both of their eyelids gradually closed as they settled against the cliff 
      face and fell into a light slumber. <br>
      <br>
      It had taken <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> quite some time to pass through the 
      mountains to the temples of <a href="taelosia.htm">Taelosia</a> and the constant fighting was wearing 
      them down. It seemed that at every turn they were attacked by the 
      religious trusik and the Muramites. <br>
      <br>
      At first, they were confused about the gaunt Taelosians' hatred. 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> was surprised that none of his wily charms took hold on any of them. It 
      wasn't until they met Ubaki Caroda, a nihil Taelosian hiding in the 
      mountains, that they began to understand the ways of the trusik.<br>
      <br>
      After <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> saved Ubaki from some surrounding Muramites in the 
      Tipt mountains, the aged nihil sat with them a while and explained some 
      bleaker moments in the history of the people of <a href="taelosia.htm">Taelosia</a>. <br>
      <br>
      Ubaki explained that when the Taelosians rose from the sea to land, they 
      lived life as spiritual creatures -- loving nature, life and the oceans. 
      They pursued their talents with moving and shaping stone and existed in 
      harmony for thousands of years. <br>
      <br>
      Then one Taelosian named Ikkibi Daluda, an elder at the time, ordained 
      himself a high priest and stated to all Taelosians that they were not 
      giving thanks to the bountiful oceans as they should. He believed there 
      was a deity called Trushar, the ocean god, who was displeased and required 
      devout attention of all of the Taelosians.<br>
      <br>
      Ubaki continued with the story and described the worshippers of Trushar 
      and how they grew more fanatical over many years and took to giving up the 
      lives of many Taelosians as sacrifices to the ocean god. Before too long, 
      the high council of Taelosi, the first city of <a href="taelosia.htm">Taelosia</a>, discovered that 
      the worshippers of Trushar were torturing and sacrificing non-believers 
      too. Sadly, Ubaki explained, the high council no longer had influence over 
      those that followed High Priest Ikkibi.<br>
      <br>
      The high council of Taelosi took the news and events of the city to the 
      four greatest elders of the Taelosians who lived in a hidden sanctum in 
      the mountains. It did not take long for the elders to call all Taelosians 
      together in the city to deliver their edict. All Taelosians, worshippers 
      of Trushar too, respected the elders and would heed their words.<br>
      <br>
      The elders decreed that the Taelosians would be forever divided and 
      demanded that the worshippers of Trushar, now called trusik, make their 
      way to the mountain temples to live out their lives. All others would 
      remain in Taelosi and would become known as nihil. The city of Taelosi 
      itself took the name of its new people and was named Nihilia. That was as 
      much as <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> could hear before they had to move on. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> was suddenly jolted awake by a voice and saw that 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> was 
      sleeping. Immediately alert, he jumped to his feet and looked around, his 
      fingers tightly enveloping his daggers. No one. He peered around the edge 
      of the cliff and saw a crumpled form on the ground. It looked 
      <a href="human.htm">human</a>. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Sir. Stay back, sir,&quot; the voice came from the body on the ground. It was 
      one of the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> scouts -- a 
      <a href="monks.htm">monk</a>. &quot;I have a message for 
      you . . . please wait there for a moment until I determine that it is 
      safe.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> reached down and grabbed 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> by his bloodstained pauldron and 
      hoisted him up to his feet. <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> already had drawn his sword before 
      getting his bearings, nearly nicking <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> in the ribs.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Cripes <a href="elves.htm">elf</a>. Easy,&quot;
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said, examining his side.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Easy?! Why would you EVER wake me like that?&quot; 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said, going silent 
      when he saw the <a href="monks.htm">monk</a>. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> just looked at him and shook his head 
      playfully.<br>
      <br>
      The <a href="monks.htm">monk</a> slowly got to his feet and ran to
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Sir . . . I am Chadrik. It is an honour and a pleasure to meet you. My 
      whole family serves you and we are grateful for --&quot; the 
      <a href="monks.htm">monk</a> began, but 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> stopped him.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Stop blathering and thanking. I'm no one special, well, not really,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> grinned and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> sighed at his friend's humour. &quot;What's the 
      message?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;<a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> is becoming frightfully ill,&quot; Chadrik said. &quot;When I left to come 
      find you the day after you left, she was very weak and getting paler by 
      the hour. We don't know what is wrong with her, but our best 
      <a href="shamans.htm">shamans</a> and 
      priests are doing what they can to help her.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> was awestruck and, for the first time, 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> actually witnessed
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> lose his composure.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I don't understand. 'ow could she be ill? I saw 'er just days ago. Did 
      someone hurt 'er? What 'appened?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> began to babble as he shook the 
      shoulders of the <a href="monks.htm">monk</a> in his thick, dirt- and blood-smeared hands.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I'm sorry sir, I don't know. She did not want anyone to tell you of her 
      illness, but I felt it my duty to come find you and tell you. She did not 
      want to interfere with your mission,&quot; Chadrik said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, that is 'er. Always selfless. I must return to see what is 'appenin',&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> reached up and grabbed 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> shoulder, turning him 
      around.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We must continue. We will not have the strength to make this journey a 
      second time, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. I know she will be okay. I can feel it,&quot; 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> expression of worry became a scowl and he glared at his friend.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What would ye know of it? 'ow can ye idly say she'll be fine? Ye don't 
      understand 'ow important she is. No idea at all. I don't care what ye 
      feel!&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> yelled.<br>
      <br>
      His voice carried on the dank air and alerted the Muramites standing on 
      the steps of a temple. The three troubled adventurers had mere moments to 
      forget their quarrel and draw their weapons before a horde of Muramites 
      rushed around the cliff's edge to meet them. </font> <br>
