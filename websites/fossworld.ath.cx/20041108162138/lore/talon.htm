      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Talon Southpaw was the fastest pugilist 
      ever to walk within the Court of Pain. His speed rivalled that of the 
      great Grandmaster Tynn. He could often be found within the local taverns 
      demonstrating the awesome speed of his fist. <br>
      <br>
      Talon Southpaw came to rebirth within this caste. Although quick with fist 
      and tail, the speed of his left arm was not to come to blossom for a 
      couple decades past his rebirth. It was to follow his captivity by the 
      accursed Samak. <br>
      <br>
      Soon after fulfilling the Rung of Tynn, Talon went on a wandering retreat 
      into the dangerous outlands of <a href="kunark.htm">Kunark</a>. He was not 
      seen from for a total of 5 seasons. Upon his return to
      <a href="cabalis.htm">Cabilis</a> he told of his captivity within an 
      ancient city of <a href="iksars.htm">Iksar</a> now claimed by the Samak. 
      He told of intense torture. <br>
      He survived the ordeal. He escaped from the claws of the Samak with 
      numerous scars which proved of his painful ordeal. Most of the worst scars 
      were never to be seen. Talon worn a robe which he never removed. The scars 
      underneath were for no lizards eyes. his great perseverance gave him an 
      inner strength no other <a href="monks.htm">monk</a> could lay claim to.
      <br>
      <br>
      He now possessed incredible, almost blinding speed with his left arm. He 
      could tap a foes arm with his left and strike with as if having a third 
      arm! He was indeed a paragon of the Swifttails. All the empire under 
      respected or feared him. None would spar him outside of the taverns. With 
      grog comes stupidity. <br>
      <br>
      Upon his death in <a href="kurns%20tower.htm">Kurn</a>, Grandmaster Tynn 
      removed his hands in a private ceremony. Only Tynn was allowed to gaze 
      upon Talon's body. The fists were then sealed in a canopic which would 
      stay within the <a href="kurns%20tower.htm">Tower of Kurn</a>. His body 
      was dusted. This is his tale as told by Rinmark.</font></p>
