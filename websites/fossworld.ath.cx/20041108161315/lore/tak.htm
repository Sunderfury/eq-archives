      <img border="0" src="Ruanya_Windleaf.jpg" width="82" height="85">Ruanya Windleaf says 'I must tell you, I'm a little saddened by the fate 
      of the elves in Takish-Hiz. By all accounts, that city once held such 
      great splendour and beauty. Now it is a such a menacing place. It does 
      torment me some that I cannot walk amongst the echoes of my ancestors 
      without fear. I'm so glad that you've come to hear the story though. I'm 
      feeling somewhat morose at the moment, but I'd be glad to start this long 
      tale another time.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'I apologize for my depressed mood the last time we 
      spoke Krozman. I am ready to begin the story of my ancestors now. The tale 
      begins soon after the planet of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> began its journey around the sun, 
      called Sol. Our fair mother of the <a href="plane%20of%20growth.htm">Plane of Growth</a>,
      <a href="tunare.htm">Tunare</a>, put the first 
      intelligent beings on <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>, the 
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a>. About the same time, 
      <a href="brell_serilis.htm">Brell 
      Serilis</a> of the <a href="plane%20of%20underfoot.htm">Plane of Underfoot</a> created the dwarves who dwelled inside 
      the very crust of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. Then, 
      <a href="prexus.htm">Prexus</a>, the Ocean Lord, created the 
      <a href="kedge%20keep.htm">Kedge</a> 
      to rule the oceanic depths of the world. Around that time, 
      <a href="veeshan.htm">Veeshan</a> claimed 
      the skies, <a href="tunare.htm">Tunare</a> the surface lands, Brell the underground and 
      <a href="prexus.htm">Prexus</a> the 
      seas. It wasn't that simple really, but it will have to wait. I must 
      practice my archery now, friend. I need to be prepared for exploration and 
      battle at all times.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'You have returned in good time, Krozman. I am 
      between tasks at the moment, but I will need to do more scouting of 
      Takish-Hiz shortly. I wanted to tell you about a critical turning point 
      earlier in our history. There was a time when the lands of 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> were 
      split amongst the gods so they would have true homes for their creations. 
      <a href="tunare.htm">Tunare</a> and <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro</a>, the Prince of Flame, both wanted to claim the 
      <a href="elddarforest.htm">Elddar Forest</a> as their own. There was no settlement though, Tunare simply 
      acted more quickly. As I will tell you soon, <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro</a> took exception to
      <a href="tunare.htm">Tunare's</a> hasty creation of the elves. I must continue with my scouting 
      now.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf beams with pride, her upturned eyes brightly greeting you. 
      'Ha, I beat my companion Escon Quickbow in an archery competition. Grand 
      day! Yes, I have more information for you about <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro</a>. The Prince of 
      Flame watched the elves quietly build and live without conflict for 
      thousands of years. Takish-Hiz was built out of wood and marble with much 
      skill and beauty. It was so striking and bright the gods could see it glow 
      from a great distance. <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro</a> became envious and angry at 
      <a href="tunare.htm">Tunare</a> and 
      her creations. In fact, his vengeful acts brought ruin to the elves of 
      Takish-Hiz.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'Quickly now, Krozman. I have spotted some tracks 
      nearby I do not want to lose. I just came back to the camp for supplies. 
      <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro</a> reached down to 
      <a href="antonica.htm">Antonica</a> with his fiery touch and arched the 
      spine of the world. The geographical act would be slow and not draw 
      attention to his actions. He then called upon the power of the Ro, the 
      sun. The sun began to dry the forest. Now, I really must go. I don't want 
      to lose the tracks I found.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'The tale gets somewhat sad at this juncture. The 
      elves watched the outer edges of the <a href="elddarforest.htm">Elddar Forest</a> wither and die and it 
      was progressing faster. The <a href="druids.htm">druids</a> of Takish-Hiz used their most powerful 
      magic to try to stop the advance of the drought. They would call for rain 
      and protection from <a href="tunare.htm">Tunare</a>. They received neither. 
      <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro's</a>&nbsp; grip was 
      too strong. That's all I know about that part of the story. I think you 
      should go talk to Farwein Windrun in the 
      <a href="desertofro.htm#Southern Desert of Ro">south deserts of Ro</a>. He can tell 
      you more.'<br>
      &nbsp;</font><p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font color="#008000">
      (Insert Pic Here)</font><br>
      Farwein Windrun says 'Hail Krozman. I'm certain that Ruanya sent you to 
      me. That must mean you want to learn more about Takish-Hiz and the 
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a>. 
      I do have an interesting tale about that. Some call it folklore, but I say 
      it is true. The story was passed amongst the <a href="woodelves.htm">wood elves</a> for centuries. 
      Give me some time to organize and we will talk, friend.'<br>
      <br>
      Farwein Windrun says 'So glad you're here. I've been aching to tell my 
      story. Soon after Takish-Hiz was built, not only did 
      <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro</a> become 
      angry, <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a> did as well. He abhorred the sickly sweet and lovely
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> and wanted to disrupt the peaceful city and cut into
      <a href="tunare.htm">Tunare's</a> heart. Sorry 
      to stop here Krozman, but I must practice. Don't tell anyone, but I've 
      been learning the geomantic arts!'<br>
      <br>
      Farwein Windrun says 'So good to receive you again, Krozman. We can 
      continue without interruption for a short time. When the Prince of Hate, 
      <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a>, saw how happily and peacefully the 
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> lived, his ire burned 
      like an inferno. He stole the king and queen right from their thrones in 
      Takish-Hiz without any warning and imprisoned them in the 
      <a href="plane%20of%20hate.htm">Plane of Hate</a>, 
      his terrible home. Oh, I am afraid I must now return to the
      <a href="faydark.htm">Faydarks</a> for a 
      short spell and visit my family. I have just remembered they talked about 
      an artefact of the old elves they keep hidden. I am yearning to see it!'<br>
      <br>
      Farwein Windrun says 'I had a wonderful visit with my family, Krozman. 
      Where were we? Hm. Ah, yes. <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a> tortured the elven king and queen of 
      Takish-Hiz for 300 years. He twisted their minds and tortured their bodies 
      until they were no longer beautiful and bright. He rebuilt them as he saw 
      fit until they became the first of <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk's</a> intelligent abominations on 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. They became known as the 
      <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elves</a>, or Teir'Dal. Speaking of 
      frightful, I must return to Takish-Hiz. My friends are signalling me to 
      hurry our discussion. I'll see you soon.'<br>
      <br>
      Farwein Windrun says 'The story of the <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> and Takish-Hiz is becoming 
      more familiar to me the more I tell it. I must say though, it is 
      heartbreaking to learn that the <a href="elddarforest.htm">Elddar Forest</a> used to stretch across the 
      entire southeastern quarter of <a href="antonica.htm">Antonica</a>. I am sure we would have found it 
      magnificent! It is even sadder that some of the gods had such a hatred of 
      the elves. Anyway, I must go cook my friends a meal. I would suggest that 
      you return to Ruanya Windleaf to discuss more about the fate of Takish-Hiz 
      and the elves.'<br>
      <br>
      <img border="0" src="Ruanya_Windleaf.jpg" width="82" height="85">Ruanya Windleaf looks over a strange piece of blue ore and hides it when 
      she sees you approach. 'Hail Krozman. These are certainly interesting 
      times. We are seeing all sorts of new things these days. I do need to tell 
      you what happened in Takish-Hiz that led to the demise of many of my elven 
      ancestors. I must ask you to remember that <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro</a> called upon the 
      power of sun we call Ro that would ultimately be the end of the first 
      elven city. I must continue my fletching right now, but when you return, I 
      can tell you more.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'How nice to set eyes upon you again Krozman. Like I 
      had said, the destructive heat of the sun called upon by <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro</a> 
      brought the <a href="elddarforest.htm">Elddar Forest</a> to its end. As the trees withered and became 
      petrified and the soil lost all of its nourishment, sands began to close 
      in on Takish-Hiz. King and Queen Tak'Yaliz, who replaced the first King 
      and Queen Tak'Hiz that were stolen by <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a>, commanded all of the 
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> 
      to protect their city from the encroaching sands. Can we talk another 
      time? Patchka Ceorvra needs my assistance with gathering some shrubs for 
      her alchemy practice.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'Let's begin again, Krozman! All of the 
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> of 
      Takish-Hiz brought their strongest magic outside the city to protect it 
      from the heat of sun. They fashioned aqueducts and resurrected trees and 
      planted new ones to try to force the sands backward. As the natural 
      resources needed to perform their magic dwindled, the <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> had to look 
      elsewhere. King and Queen Tak'Yaliz and their advisors called a grand 
      assembly with the <a href="druids.htm">druids</a> to propose an alternative that would be a massive 
      undertaking. That's all I have time for right now. So much to do!'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'Lend me your ear again, Krozman and we'll continue 
      where we left off. During the assembly of the <a href="druids.htm">druids</a> of Takish-Hiz, the 
      king and queen pointed their faithful citizens toward a new magic art . . 
      . geomancy. All of the citizens of Takish-Hiz were then given specific 
      duties that would save the city. Some citizens were sent out to maintain 
      the forest with shovels and seeds, and others were sent to the great 
      libraries to learn and improve upon geomantic arts. I have to meet a 
      fellow <a href="woodelves.htm">wood elf</a> for more information on the story, but I'll be back soon.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'I have more detail to give you Krozman. As the sands 
      continued to pour in around the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> of Takish-Hiz like a merciless sea, 
      parts of the city began to fall to the pressure of the failing earth. But 
      the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> did not falter in their resolve and desire to save their home. 
      The geomancers used the sands to form new walls where the stone crumbled. 
      All the wood that cracked and split under the advancing sands were also 
      replaced by reformed earth. Soon, large parts of the city were replaced 
      with sandy architecture. Each day the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> fought to maintain their city, 
      but it would be a battle that would seemingly never end. I must make an 
      entry in my journal now, friend. Return soon!'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'That <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> certainly is an interesting sort. From 
      time to time, he has visions about Takish-Hiz and tells me what he sees. 
      Lucky for us, I suppose! Anyway, let us continue with the story. The king 
      and queen of Takish-Hiz came to accept that much of their city was buried 
      under the scorching sands and what remained was fast becoming unliveable. 
      They saw some of their most faithful and powerful geomancers trapped in 
      ruins of the city as some of the structures failed. It was time to make a 
      decision. I'll tell you more about that later. I have to do some foraging. 
      We're running low on supplies.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'More about the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a>? Good! King and Queen Tak'Yaliz 
      used a great horn to signal to all of their citizens that it was time to 
      flee their failing city. They decided it could not be saved. The  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a>, 
      weary and worn, left the scorched earth that came to be known as the 
      <a href="desertofro.htm">deserts of Ro</a> and made their way across the 
      <a href="ocean%20of%20tears.htm">Ocean of Tears</a> to a new and 
      fertile land. They began to settle in a forest named the
      <a href="faydark.htm">Faydarks</a> that was 
      much like the <a href="elddarforest.htm">Elddar Forest</a> once was. What they did not know is that some 
      of their ancestors did survive deep beneath the sands in Takish-Hiz. We 
      must discuss this another time, friend. I have a guest coming soon and I 
      need to prepare.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'Hail, Krozman. I would recommend you go inquire 
      about the decrepit state of Takish-Hiz and the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> with Niflel Faliwae 
      in the <a href="faydark.htm#Greater Faydark">Greater Faydarks</a>. She has been doing a lot of research on the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> of Takish-Hiz and has quite a tale to tell. She can provide you with more 
      insight than me. Safe journey!'<br>
      <br>
      <img border="0" src="niflel.JPG" width="109" height="107">Niflel Faliwae says 'Ah, you've come to learn of the fate of the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> of 
      Takish-Hiz. Well, as the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> of the <a href="elddarforest.htm">Elddar Forest</a> fled to 
      <a href="faydwer.htm">Faydwer</a>, some 
      that were trapped under the sands within the city of Takish-Hiz continued 
      their efforts to prevent the sand from completely taking over the city. 
      There were many of them and they were completely unaware that the city was 
      abandoned and expended all of their energy trying to rebuild the city and 
      free themselves. It is the hour for me to meditate friend, but I would be 
      pleased if you returned to hear more.'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'I am happy you have returned. The fate of my 
      ancestors is significant in my opinion. The  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> buried in Takish-Hiz 
      began to get desperate over time. Food supplies and natural resources were 
      dwindling at an alarming rate. They needed to buy time for their rescue. 
      Then, the masters of geomancy agreed to conduct a most unusual experiment, 
      mostly out of curiosity, but all quietly recognizing it may be useful in 
      the future. They gathered a number of insects and began to reconstruct 
      their biology with sand using the geomantic arts. It took many attempts 
      before the first insect survived with legs made of sand. Once they had 
      mastered the recreation of limbs, they turned their focus to organs and 
      brains of the lowest forms of living creature in the sand-filled city. 
      Sorry, Krozman. This is a long tale and I must break it into digestible 
      portions. Return soon and I will tell you more.'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'I keep finding more information on the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a>, the 
      more time I spend in Takish-Hiz. Yes, back to the geomancers endeavours. 
      While the insects they experimented with had no brains to speak of, the 
      geomancers were able to recreate the insects entirely and the resulting 
      sandy beings behaved normally in their eyes. With what they had learned 
      from those experiments, the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> were able to summon a variety of 
      creatures that could assist them with keeping the city repaired. More 
      another time then, Krozman? I do hope so.'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'I've found a journal with the most thrilling story! 
      It says that when the remaining food was nearly all consumed in Takish-Hiz, 
      the surviving  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> had to consider alternatives on how they would live. 
      Collectively, they had some ideas with implications that were horrific to 
      the geomancers. But then, one brave  
      <a href="elves.htm">elf</a>, Cirwea Strongbow, overlooked the 
      geomancers discomfort and begged them to use his body for a most dangerous 
      experiment. As Cirwea's arm was crushed when part of a great stone wall 
      fell on him, he hoped the geomancers could replace it with their magic. 
      His arm was turning black quickly and he feared he would die anyway. He 
      was also hoping he might be the first elf that would be completely turned 
      to sand. Find me soon Krozman and we'll go further on the path of this 
      story. I need to read more myself.'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'Hello Krozman. I've spent much time reading and 
      piecing the story of the 
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> together. As it happens, the geomancers 
      were reluctant and afraid that Cirwea could lose his young life altogether 
      if they experimented on his arm. However, Cirwea urged them on. He 
      convinced them he would die anyway as there was nearly no food left and 
      his arm was rife with disease. The geomancers acquiesced and worked for 
      many days to prepare, practicing on several creatures that were available 
      to them. When the geomancers were more confident, they coaxed the last 
      wolf of Takish-Hiz into their special summoning chambers. They managed to 
      completely replace the wolf's flesh with sand. Together they decided they 
      were satisfied with the results as the dog behaved as it usually had. That 
      is when they turned their attention to Cirwea. We must end this for now, 
      Krozman. We will both know more by the time we see each other again.'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'This is a most unusual story, Krozman. I read that 
      the day finally came for Cirwea and he was prepared for the test. He was 
      rested on a bed of sand with his arms and legs were outstretched. The 
      geomancers put him into a trance, gathered around him, and joined hands. 
      Together they all crouched to the floor and buried their fingers in the 
      sands. They began to chant and their arms glowed blue, yellow, and green 
      with their summoning gifts. The sand underneath Cirwea shook and undulated 
      in ripples around him. They were upon the moment of truth. With more time, 
      I can continue. This is as far as I've gotten in the tale myself.'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'This journal about Takish-Hiz has me mesmerized! It 
      says that as the geomancers stood around Cirwea, chanting, one of the 
      geomancers leaned forward on her knees and began sculpting sand into the 
      shape of an arm. She lifted the sculpture and it remained bound by the 
      magic. She laid it on top of Cirwea's bruised and broken arm and pushed 
      lightly downward. Sparks of blue magic danced around the sculpture of the 
      arm as it worked its way into Cirwea's flesh and bone. In a moment, the 
      magic dissipated. Cirwea blinked and opened his eyes. They all waited, 
      barely breathing. With a smile, Cirwea turned his eyes to each one of the 
      geomancers that stood above him. Then, he wiggled the fingers on the hand 
      of his sandy arm. Fantastic, is it not? You must go now so I can read 
      more!'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'How terrible it must have been in Takish-Hiz, hm? In 
      my last reading, I learned that as food became extinct, the geomancers all 
      began to replace their living bodies with sand. The one part of the body 
      they did not dare replace was their brains. While the wolf they had 
      transformed into a sand creature long ago still lived, it was not as 
      rambunctious as it once was. It was a cause for concern, but all of the 
      remaining elves knew they would have to abandon their natural biology or 
      they would die. All of their efforts would be for naught if they were not 
      able to survive with their skills and spirits in tact. They wouldn't be 
      able to protect the city. I'm aching to read more, Krozman. When I see you 
      again, we'll carry on.'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'The bravery of my ancestors really makes my heart 
      proud. Again, Cirwea offered his head and mind for the first experiment 
      the geomancers would perform. His bravery and faith in his fellow 
      geomancers was unequalled. With his usual persuasiveness, Cirwea told his 
      fellow fading  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> that they had to try or none of them would survive. 
      Once again, they prepared the summoning room. The tension in the air felt 
      as heavy as the sand bearing down on them. I'm afraid that's all I know at 
      this point. I plan to read more soon.'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'I was able to steal a few minutes with the journal 
      left by some of the Takish-Hiz elves and read some eerie details around 
      the grand experiment they conducted. The geomancers all gathered around 
      Cirwea once more, but this time his eyes were lifeless. Ahead of time, the 
      geomancers created a unique sculpture that was a totem. They were able to 
      trap Cirwea's spirit within it. It was hoped that the spirit within the 
      totem would be released within Cirwea's completely earthen form. Their 
      eyes shone more keenly this day because they knew they faced the answer to 
      the question they had all been asking themselves . . . would they be able 
      to survive as sand creatures? And so, the summoning ceremony began. That's 
      as far as I was able to read! I must get back to it!'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'This journal is the most fascinating text I have ever 
      read. To continue, dear Krozman, the summoning ceremony finished and once 
      again Cirwea opened his eyes. The  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> were all somewhat taken aback as 
      his eyes did shine once again, but now his eyes were made of gems. Once 
      more, he smiled. In a gravely voice, he said 'My name is Cirwea and I am 
      your first sand elf!' From that moment, the  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> began their feverish 
      transformation to becoming sand elves. But, they should have waited longer 
      to see how this new form would affect them over time. I'm not sure why, 
      because I haven't read that far. When I find spare time, I will read more, 
      I promise!'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'Goodness! I have been anxious for you to return so I 
      can tell you more! Cirwea, the first sand elf, was also the first to show 
      an alarming change. He talked to his fellow geomancers less and less as 
      the days passed. He was consumed with constantly repairing and rebuilding 
      the city. While his fellow  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> would take time to talk and share their 
      lives, he would continue to manipulate the sands. Then, the other  
      <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> began talking less and less. I'm afraid there are some pages missing in 
      the journal. I plan to return to Takish-Hiz to find them.'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'I found most of the missing pages! It seems that 
      there was a desperate attempt by the youngest sand elves to restore all of 
      the spirits of the sand elves into new totems so they would be protected. 
      In the process, they lost several elves completely as their spirits were 
      all but gone and could not be trapped into the totems. Some of the elves 
      toyed with ending their lives, but hoped that someday that if they were 
      rescued they could be restored to their formal physical beauty and 
      intelligence. But it was not to be. I must read the final pages, dear 
      Krozman. Come back soon and we'll end this tale together!'<br>
      <br>
      Niflel Faliwae says 'I should have been prepared for the sad ending of the 
      elves, but I was not. My heart is troubled. The final pages of the journal 
      ends as all of the elves succumbed to their sandy hosts and all lost their 
      love for life. The journal became hazy because there were no elves to 
      finish it. The sand elves you see now are just echoes of the elves they 
      once were. They are not really the ancestors of the elves because they 
      have become something else. They still see the continuing threat of the 
      sands burying their city and continue to rebuild it with the sands. Now 
      that we have discovered them, they fight even harder to protect all that 
      they have sought to rebuild. That is all the information I have on 
      Takish-Hiz right now, I'm afraid. You should go visit Ruanya Windleaf. I 
      believe she may have more to tell you.'<br>
      <br>
      <img border="0" src="Ruanya_Windleaf.jpg" width="82" height="85">Ruanya Windleaf says 'The story of the sand elves is sad, is it not? While 
      you were away, we were able to learn more about the sand elves as they 
      move about Takish-Hiz now. The elves do retain a faint memory of what 
      their professions used to be. The Flowkeepers oversee the movement of the 
      sands in the city. They are somewhat like advisors to the elves and 
      indicate when the tides of the sands are in the best position to perform 
      summoning ceremonies. They patrol the city looking for impending damage. 
      With a bit more time, I can tell you more, dear Krozman.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'We've just returned from another expedition into 
      Takish-Hiz. We discovered that the Geomantic Compact compliments the 
      Flowkeepers. The compact is comprised of priests that are the primary 
      force behind the summoning ceremonies. The Geomantic Compact is also 
      responsible for making sure the hourglass that remains in the city is 
      constantly turned, so the sands still indicate time. The Geomantic Compact 
      holds the masters of geomancy. There is more study required before we 
      continue, my friend.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'Greetings Krozman! While we were exploring, we came 
      upon the Royal attendants. They are all that is remaining of the advisors 
      and guards of King and Queen Tak'Yaliz who had long-since abandoned the 
      city. They became quiet workers, but they are very skilled with weapons 
      due to their former professions. They were the <a href="warriors.htm">warriors</a> of the realm. Now 
      they are just faint semblances of their former heroics. Extremely sad that 
      there were so many survivors left behind, isn't it?'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'It is indeed unfortunate that we lost one of our 
      best during a jaunt to Takish-Hiz. The Jeweled Guard, remnants of the most 
      fearsome of the elves, were the <a href="warriors.htm">warriors</a> and masters of battle in the 
      city. Even in their spirit-drained state, they continue to train and 
      behave with great discipline as they play out the habits they used to have 
      when their spirits lived within them. While they are only shades of their 
      former selves, they are still ferocious in a fight. In fact, I got a few 
      scars myself from them that need attention. See you soon, Krozman.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'I've discovered a bit of madness in Takish-Hiz, dear 
      Krozman. The Cave Dwellers in the city are the outcasts of Takish-Hiz. 
      Many are frail and appear crazy and unable to function. These are the most 
      faded of the sand elves that had the weakest spirits to begin with. It's 
      very upsetting to see the glow completely gone from their eyes, though. No 
      matter, they are just shades of their former splendor. I must go visit 
      with Nedaria Debeian and tell her what I've learned too.'<br>
      <br>
      Ruanya Windleaf says 'I was hoping you had come to tell me something 
      Krozman! I am out of information to relay to you. I suppose this means 
      we're on equal footing! I'm fairly sure the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> 
      considers you an ally by now! I've much enjoyed bending your ear with my 
      story. I hope maybe someday you will do the same for me!'</font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="2"><br>
