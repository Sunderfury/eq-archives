      <font face="Bookman Old Style">As she slept, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria Debeian's</a> thinning body shivered each time she 
      gasped in a shallow breath. Her once dark, lustrous <a href="erudites.htm">Erudite</a> skin was 
      becoming flaked and ashen. It had been days since she had been strong 
      enough to speak. <br>
      <br>
      Days ago, when <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> felt her illness progressing, she appointed two 
      trusted friends, Wuria Pyskar and Parillin Shurava, in the 
      <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers 
      Brotherhood</a> to tend to her needs and reassure everyone that she simply had 
      a flu. The truth was that no one -- not even the best shamans and clerics 
      -- knew what was wrong with her.<br>
      <br>
      Twice, the most wise and practiced healers were brought in to examine 
      Nedaria in her room on the great vessel, the Queen of Thorns, to offer 
      diagnoses and remedies. Nothing worked.<br>
      <br>
      Wuria and Parillin kept watch over <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> constantly in shifts, praying 
      for a sign of hope. At times they would argue about <a href="nedaria.htm">
      Nedaria's</a> mysterious 
      malady. <br>
      <br>
      Not known for her trust in people, the dwarven Wuria thought 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> was a 
      victim of sabotage and blamed Norrathians and their arrogance for her 
      friend's failing health. She believed that the gods might have otherwise 
      granted healing gifts to <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> if they knew she was so ill. Parillin, 
      always the gossiping romantic <a href="vahshir.htm">Vah Shir</a>, believed that 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> had a broken 
      heart that would mend as soon as <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> returned. She fancied that 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> were in love.<br>
      <br>
      Both of them silently recognized that their foolish squabbles simply kept 
      their minds off of their worst fear -- <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> was dying.<br>
      <br>
      This day, Wuria took the first watch -- though day and night were 
      indiscernible aboard the ship in the constant darkness of the 
      <a href="abysmal%20sea.htm">Abysmal Sea</a> 
      -- and sat near <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>. To pass the time, she read reports that had been 
      coming in from scouts in <a href="taelosia.htm">Taelosia</a> and wrote notes in the ship's journals. 
      It was very quiet, except for <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> wheezing and the rhythmic creak of 
      the Queen of Thorns as it rocked in the turbulent waters. <br>
      <br>
      The candles in the room flickered, making the words Wuria read appear to 
      dance around the page. She looked up and met a troubled gaze.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Oy, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>. No change yet, I'm afraid. Her breathing seems more labored 
      now . . . and . . . well, I won't go on. I'm at a loss,&quot; Wuria said.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> nodded and walked to
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> bedside, sat down next to her, and 
      gently held one of her hands that lay on her chest.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Can you leave us please? I want to speak to her alone. At one time she 
      could speak to me in my mind and I want to try the same with her,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> asked, never looking up from 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> gaunt face.<br>
      <br>
      Wuria left the room without a word.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Now, dear <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>, try to hear me. I see your eyes move. I know you are 
      still here somewhere and I will find you. You must help me do this,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> pleaded aloud.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> relaxed and let his head hang low as he began to send himself into 
      a deep meditation. He grasped <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> hand tightly as he called out to 
      her mind. <br>
      <br>
      After a few moments, an unexpected torrent of jumbled thoughts and 
      knowledge flooded <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> mind so fast he choked on his own breath. He 
      remembered the last time this happened -- when he felt the touch of 
      <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">Zebuxoruk</a> and just a fraction of his lord's knowledge. Somehow, though, 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> was not overrun to the point of madness. He felt as though he were 
      removed, simply an audience this time.<br>
      <br>
      All at once, he felt a familiar darkness and fervid tentacles of evil 
      worming their way around his thoughts. He tried to rise from his 
      meditative state and couldn't. His mind's voice screamed for help.<br>
      <br>
      Nedaria's face faded into view before <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> mind's eye. She smiled at 
      him and overcame all of his fears, his mind feeling free once more.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I cannot feel or see anything but you, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>,&quot; 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> whispered. &quot;My 
      body is failing as my mind is weakened. Something feels wrong, but my 
      visions fail me.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;'Tis the second time I've felt my mind open and a presence within it,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said to <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> in his mind, but mouthing the words as he sat next 
      to her. &quot;That amulet I sent <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> for might be the key . . . 
      maybe for your illness too. I don't know.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I sense nothing and I do not know what is happening to me. It is indeed 
      odd that your mind opens as mine closes,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> face started fading 
      from <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> mind. &quot;Tell . . . 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. . . that he must go on as I may 
      not. I . . . do . . . love him and will lend him my spirit should I die. 
      He must . . . lead . . .&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> face faded and <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> was able to open his eyes. <br>
      <br>
      The lovely and weak <a href="erudites.htm">Erudite</a> before him began to shudder wildly. 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> started convulsing.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Oh, what have I done? What have I DONE?!&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> cried. &quot;Someone come 
      help NOW! Wuria! Parillin!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> aides ran into the room and were awestruck at 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> violent 
      tremors. Wuria glared at <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and pushed him out of the way.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Get out now and send a <a href="clerics.htm">cleric</a> and 
      <a href="shamans.htm">shaman</a>,&quot; Wuria yelled with hateful 
      venom. &quot;We'll be lucky if we can save her.&quot;<br>
