      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> took a worn rag from his satchel and 
      wiped the sweat off his brow, leaving a light smear of dirt across his 
      cheek. It had been several days since he, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>, 
      and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> first sucked the burning air of the 
      place called the <a href="lavastorm.htm">Lavastorm Mountains</a> into 
      their lungs.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I've decided we ought to give our faithful band a name of some sort,&quot;
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. &quot;We're becoming somewhat 
      renowned, are we not?! I think we ought to take pride in what we do and 
      who we are. . . aye. Knowing us like I do, I think we ought to call 
      ourselves the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a>.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal's</a> violet eyes shone with pride upon 
      hearing the name.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Yes, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. A fine name indeed. A real 
      family,&quot; he said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, I agree. It's been a long time coming and the name should serve us 
      well as we continue our travels,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> chimed 
      in. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Well, enough of that then, eh? Be sure to get the word out! As for me, I 
      need to get meself back in those mines and find a way past that mess o' 
      goblins and bloody clockworks,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      moaned. &quot;I've never seen such a blasted infernal place and I am really not 
      used to such resistance to my good looks. <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> 
      weren't even this difficult.&quot; <br>
      He winked at <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> sighed, shook her head and turned away 
      from <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> to hide a smile. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> hummed as he wrapped three lock picks 
      in leather straps, so they wouldn't make any sound in his satchel as he 
      moved. He rummaged through a crate and gathered up some rope, a few 
      morsels of bread, and a flask of water. He bid his friends -- now of the
      <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> -- farewell and set 
      off toward the crater bubbling with lava.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> busied herself building the camp in the
      <a href="lavastorm.htm">Lavastorm Mountains</a> with all the new 
      adventurers that had followed from the <a href="burning%20woods.htm">
      Burning Woods</a>. They all waited patiently as <a href="MordenRasp.htm">
      Morden</a> continued his attempts to move with the shadows past all the 
      terrible creatures in the Solusek mines. <br>
      He had been trying for days to get close enough to listen to the whispers 
      and wonderings within the ranks of the Solusek kobolds. It had proven 
      difficult and <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> could feel his 
      aggravation. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> both 
      hoped he would have more success this day.<br>
