      <br>
      Today we embark on a journey that will lead us past the boundaries of our 
      known world. It is by our choice that we make this journey, to discover 
      new lands, and to make a new home for ourselves. It is an honour to call 
      you countrymen and friends. Let us rejoice in our accomplishments as we 
      take the lands of our pitiful brothers, and show them the way of the true 
      gnoll. Be well, my brothers, and may the gods guide your hands.<br>
      <br>
      Tesch Val,<br>
      <br>
      You must recover, from the archives, the incantations to speed our transit 
      to the new continent. Let not one of the council members see you, or you 
      will surely be slain. You must complete this task I have laid before you, 
      or they will eventually find us and slay us. The accursed council knows of 
      my location, so I must be off. Slay the messenger of this note when you 
      have <br>
      finished reading it.<br>
      <br>
      Good journey to you, my faithful.<br>
      <br>
      Rosch Val,<br>
      <br>
      Our plans have failed. We must escape this continent or risk being slain 
      by the other elders on the council. My place upon the council was forfeit 
      once it became known that I practised the dark magiks. We must quicken our 
      search for the maps. If we are unable to find the spell which will open 
      the gate to <a href="antonica.htm">Antonica</a>, then we must acquire 
      another means of travel.<br>
