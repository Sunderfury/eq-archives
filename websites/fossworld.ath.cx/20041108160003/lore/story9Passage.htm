      <font face="Bookman Old Style">As <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp's</a> camp of adventurers grew and 
      readied for an expedition, the <a href="overking.htm">Overking Bathezid 
      Di`Zok</a> in <a href="chardok.htm">Chardok</a> called a secret council to 
      his chambers. Those closest to the <a href="overking.htm">Overking</a> 
      were suspicious of <a href="korocust.htm">Korucust's</a> actions of late.
      <br>
      <br>
      Over the past decade, <a href="korocust.htm">Korucust</a> ascended the 
      ranks to become a trusted member of the <a href="overking.htm">Overking's</a> 
      security forces and had been rampantly making accusations of treachery 
      within the brood. He pointed his finger at some of the most powerful
      <a href="brood%20of%20dizok.htm">Di`Zok</a> and those he charged 
      disappeared into his interrogation chambers. <br>
      <br>
      The <a href="overking.htm">Overking</a> observed that
      <a href="korocust.htm">Korucust</a> often vanished for days at a time with 
      no explanation and it concerned him. <br>
      <br>
      This night, the <a href="overking.htm">Overking's</a> assembled council 
      planned to pool its magic for a spell of powerful vision that would allow 
      them to see into <a href="korocust.htm">Korucust's</a> rooms without 
      detection.<br>
      <br>
      The dozen members of the secret council filtered into the chambers and sat 
      in a loose circle around the <a href="overking.htm">Overking</a>. <br>
      <br>
      One of the mages began to mutter an incantation. Then, another began. And 
      another. Soon, the echoes of the chanting voices took an airy form, a 
      window of sight, which the <a href="overking.htm">Overking</a> controlled 
      with his own mind. He willed the magic eye through the deep caverns of
      <a href="chardok.htm">Chardok</a> to <a href="korocust.htm">Korucust's</a> 
      rooms.<br>
      <br>
      He inched the eye through a wall where faint squeals emanated. <br>
      <br>
      Gasps stole the air in the <a href="overking.htm">Overking's</a> chamber 
      as horror robbed the mages of their breath.<br>
      <br>
      The <a href="overking.htm">Overking's</a> own blood chilled and his heart 
      darkened as he watched <a href="korocust.htm">Korucust</a> torture Gimliox 
      Ran`Ti, one of the palace's master healers. <br>
      <br>
      The only words <a href="korocust.htm">Korucust</a> uttered were in a 
      necromantic language. His blood-coated arms were ablaze with a dark red 
      magical energy. <br>
      <br>
      Gimliox's screams began to ebb and his eyes slowly rolled under his scaled 
      lids. Calm washed over his reptilian features. <br>
      <br>
      The <a href="overking.htm">Overking</a> immediately understood the 
      extremity of the sinister arts that <a href="korocust.htm">Korucust</a> 
      practiced.<br>
      <br>
      Gimliox wandered mindlessly into a dark hall after <a href="korocust.htm">
      Korucust</a> unshackled him. He could be heard muttering phrases of 
      nonsense drawn from his shattered mind.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I am Shai`Din. <a href="brood%20of%20dizok.htm">The Brood of Di`Zok</a> 
      is my enemy. I am Shai`Din. I am Shai`Din. Enemies are close.&quot;<br>
