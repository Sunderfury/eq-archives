      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Moving under the concealment of night, the
      <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> made their way towards the sanctuary of 
      the dark forest. Elder masters, long settled in as trainers and city 
      leaders, found themselves leading the weary droves north along almost 
      forgotten routes. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Many had not seen the lands beyond the 
      Serpent's Spine in decades. The events that transpired during the 
      morning's battles served as a reminder to the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a>: 
      defeat lies ever in wait for the unwary. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Those same events offered many of the 
      younger trolls a first glimpse at the raw savagery and unbending will 
      shared by their race in battle. These scenes filled their minds and 
      fuelled their hatred, a burning focus for the days ahead. For the trolls, 
      their primal need for revenge smouldered, uncontainable. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Every step they took to the north magnified 
      their hate. Only as the travellers approached <a href="neriak.htm">
      Neriak's</a> dimly lit mouth did the realization of what had transpired 
      begin to solidify for many of them. No conflict so tumultuous and savage 
      had occurred within the memory of the young trolls. Stories of loss are 
      rare in <a href="trolls.htm">troll</a> lore, and thus their culture lacks 
      a true point of reference. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Weaned on the fruits of cruelty and 
      spiteful savagery, these refugees left more than their homes behind as 
      they fled the swamp's shelter. Taking refuge in their dark allies' city 
      left a brutal hole in the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a>' pride... and
      <a href="neriak.htm">Neriak</a> is a poor haven for the weak and wounded. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">To further their own goals, the elves 
      refrained from showing their complete disdain for the vanquished 
      swamp-dwellers. Allowing the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> to settle in 
      the already crowded district of the Foreign Quarter provided many 
      opportunities for monitoring this strange series of events. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">A mild tolerance would be the most 
      hospitality they would offer, as weakness had little place in their damp, 
      hate-filled halls. Only the innately malicious intelligence of the
      <a href="darkelves.htm">Teir`Dal</a> restrained their cruel nature... and 
      anyone could see that something strange and new was afoot. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">The <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> and 
      their predicament needed to be studied. As the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> 
      settled in, they found themselves to be a curiosity amongst
      <a href="neriak.htm">Neriak's</a> dark citizenry. Rumours of the events in 
      Innothule had circulated long before the displaced trolls arrived. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Many agents of the shaded paths had 
      witnessed the events in the south. Even before the first of the refugees 
      had settled into their small piece of <a href="neriak.htm">Neriak's</a> 
      Foreign Quarter, shadowy agents were sent to prod them for information.
      <a href="neriak.htm">Neriak</a> is not a hostel to be entered for free. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Stories of <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> 
      intelligent enough to sail out of the gulf and enter <a href="grobb.htm">
      Grobb</a> through the use of magic earned the royal house's curiosity. The 
      theft of the artifact and the transformation of the <a href="frogloks.htm">
      frogloks</a> were minor details to the <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elves</a>. 
      Their main priority was to determine the nature of this lost tribe of
      <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> and their cloaked companions. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">If the rumours held true, this new brood 
      from the sea might possess something more significant than the troll 
      stone. Perhaps <a href="gulf.htm">Broken Skull Rock</a> contained secrets 
      that could help the <a href="darkelves.htm">Teir`Dal</a> to increase their 
      power? It was hard for the strategists to keep their minds from drifting 
      towards the nearest harbour town and the tactical advantage they would 
      have in taking it, should they seize control of the ocean to the east. </font>
      <p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">If something within <a href="gulf.htm">
      Broken Skull Rock</a> gave <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> the ability to 
      command the seas, what power could it offer a more intelligent race?<br>
