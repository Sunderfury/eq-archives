      My lord, <br>
      In keeping with your request to find out more about
      <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> and the<br>
      recent journeys being made there, I dispatched our spies to gather what<br>
      information they could. We have had some success, and enclosed are<br>
      transcripts of letters sent by a recent group of travellers to
      <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a>. <br>
      While fragmentary and possibly filled with exaggerations, they do<br>
      shed more light upon this mysterious land. Our spies are to be commend-<br>
      ed on the excellent performance of their tasks as that getting copies of<br>
      these letters was by no means easy.<br>

      <br>
      Mentor,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      I hope this reaches you before too much time has passed. In<br>
      my last letter, I told you about securing passage on the gnomish<br>
      vessel IceBreaker, which had recently begun making voyages from<br>
      the <a href="desertofro.htm">Northern Desert of Ro</a> to the frozen 
      continent of <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a>. Little<br>
      did I know what was in store for me.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      The IceBreaker is not your typical vessel. Built like all things<br>
      gnomish, it is more about function than form or comfort. I will not<br>
      bore you with the details of my wretched journey across the
      <a href="iceclad%20ocean.htm">Iceclad<br>
      Ocean</a>. I will also refrain from commenting on the nature of the<br>
      <a href="gnomes.htm">gnomes</a> who crewed the vessel. Gnomish pirates, 
      indeed!<br>
      Having already made several voyages from <a href="antonica.htm">Antonica</a>, 
      the<br>
      <a href="gnomes.htm">gnomes</a> established a beach camp and constructed a 
      rudimentary<br>
      dock. Beyond that, they lacked for almost any real creature com-<br>
      fort. They made a few short forays inland, but mostly, they stuck<br>
      close to the landing area, trading with a relatively peaceful tribe of<br>
      gnolls that inhabited the area.<br>
      Since my companions and I embarked on this journey for the<br>
      sake of discovery and adventure, we immediately set forth to<br>
      explore this frozen land. Venturing west from the landing, we came<br>
      across a tremendous bridge spanning a huge chasm in the ice.<br>
      Nothing built by the fabled <a href="combine.htm">Combine Empire</a> can 
      compare to this<br>
      massive construction, seemingly fashioned from the bones of a<br>
      great dragon! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      Across this bridge, and away from the ocean proper, we ran<br>
      into our first trouble. Giants! And not the giants you may be famil-<br>
      iar with. These giants were different. We all know the story about<br>
      how the giants and other creations of <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a> 
      were cursed by<br>
      <a href="therathe.htm">The Rathe</a> for making war upon the gods 
      themselves. That curse<br>
      does not seem to apply to these creatures, though how they man-<br>
      aged to escape divine wrath is still a mystery to me. In any event,<br>
      they are much more intelligent and organized than their lesser<br>
      brethren, while every bit as fierce.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      We lost two of our party to a small band of these creatures<br>
      when first we set foot upon the <a href="eastern%20wastes.htm">eastern 
      wastes</a> of <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a>, and<br>
      those of us who survived were scattered. Finding myself alone, I<br>
      was determined to continue my journey westward. Moving most<br>
      carefully, and using all that I learned in my many years of adventur-<br>
      ing, I managed to avoid several more bands of giants as well as<br>
      war bands of orcs. Eventually, I came in sight of a large keep,<br>
      obviously built for giants. Not wanting to venture into what I felt<br>
      would be a very dangerous place; I struck off in the opposite<br>
      direction. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      After several days of travel, I left the realm of the giants and<br>
      orcs. Though, to my puzzlement, there seemed to be signs of some<br>
      other inhabitants. Old campfires at first, then cleverly disguised<br>
      structures built into hillsides, showing signs of recent habitation.<br>
      Imagine my surprise when while investigating one of these struc-<br>
      tures, I was confronted by a group of <a href="coldain.htm">odd pale 
      dwarves</a>! While<br>
      wary around me, they were not hostile, and were able to converse<br>
      with me in a colourful dialect of Common. They called themselves<br>
      the <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> and agreed to take me to their 
      fortress city of<br>
      <a href="thurgadin.htm">Thurgadin</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      Words can not describe this city built under an icy mountain,<br>
      so I shall not attempt it. Suffice to say that these <a href="dwarves.htm">
      dwarves</a> are<br>
      every bit as industrious and hardy as their cousins in
      <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a>. I<br>
      was brought before their king, <a href="dain.htm">Dain Frostreaver IV</a>. 
      This mighty<br>
      <a href="warriors.htm">warrior</a> welcomed me to his realm, and proceeded 
      to query me for<br>
      information about the world beyond <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a>. In 
      the process, I<br>
      learned much about <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> itself. The
      <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> take a very serious<br>
      view of their heritage and from very early childhood learn a great<br>
      deal about their history. It is their firm belief that they were chosen by
      <a href="brell_serilis.htm">Brell</a> to inhabit <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      <a name="During the ancient days">During the ancient days</a> when the first city of the <a href="dwarves.htm">
      dwarves</a> was<br>
      under construction, <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> were sent across the 
      lands and sea to<br>
      find precious reserves of stone, crystal, and ore for the project.<br>
      Ships sailed in and out by the dozens bringing supplies for the<br>
      great city. One fleet of such ships sailed across the South of<br>
      <a href="antonica.htm">Antonica</a> to reach the island we know as
      <a href="odus.htm">Odus</a>, where a quartz<br>
      mine was to be set up in the name of the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a>.
      <br>
      Led by the miner and explorer Colin Dain, the fleet carrying<br>
      several hundred <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> ran into one of the 
      worst storms <a href="prexus.htm">Prexus</a><br>
      had ever unleashed. The storm raged on for days as most of the<br>
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> huddled together in the ships' holds 
      waiting for the seas<br>
      to calm. When at last the storm passed, they found themselves<br>
      utterly lost. Even the best of the captains and navigators had no<br>
      clue as to where they were. The stars in the sky could not be relied<br>
      upon for navigation, as none of them were recognizable to the<br>
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a>. <br>
      Using typical dwarven logic, Colin Dain picked a direction to<br>
      sail and decided that their only hope was to keep sailing in that<br>
      direction until they spotted land. As the days and then weeks went<br>
      by the only noticeable change was that the weather began to get<br>
      cold. Some nights were so cold that <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> 
      froze to death on the<br>
      deck, turned into a statue of ice by the cruel weather. <br>
      Only the determination of Colin Dain kept the <a href="dwarves.htm">
      dwarves</a>' hopes<br>
      alive as he moved from ship to ship, assuring the <a href="dwarves.htm">
      dwarves</a> that<br>
      they would, &quot;Hit land soon. if not tomorrow then the day after.&quot;<br>
      Eventually Colin's words rang true as the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> 
      did indeed spot<br>
      a gigantic white landmass in the distance. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      The landing proved to be as deadly as the voyage when ice-<br>
      bergs both small and large tore the small fleet apart. Not a single<br>
      ship made it to shore. Most were torn apart far from the land,<br>
      and many <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> met Death at the hands of the 
      ocean. Less than<br>
      a hundred made it onto an icy beach. <br>
      With no serviceable ships, Colin Dain wasted little time lead-<br>
      ing his people from the shoreline. He knew they would have to<br>
      find shelter to keep from dying in the cold. He also knew they<br>
      would need to find wood and other supplies so they could repair<br>
      their ships and set off for fairer lands. So the quartz miners from<br>
      the north settled in caves a few miles inland from where they land-<br>
      ed. These caves were set into a giant mountain of ice and snow in<br>
      the northern section of the <a href="eastern%20wastes.htm">Eastern Wastes</a>.<br>
      There is an old saying that goes, &quot;<a href="dwarves.htm">Dwarves</a> are 
      like time itself,<br>
      neither can remain idle. &quot;This certainly proved true for the new<br>
      settlement. The miners quickly discovered that the hard packed ice<br>
      lying beneath the snow of <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> was as durable 
      and malleable as<br>
      stone, and ideally suited for construction in this frozen land. They<br>
      would later discover that the ice, known as Velium, had magical<br>
      properties as well.<br>
      Through time the cave settlement became a town, and then a<br>
      strong dwarven keep began to take shape within the mountain.<br>
      Named Froststone for the ice out of which it was built, the<br>
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> knew that with the completion of this 
      keep their stay on<br>
      this strange new land was permanent. Unfortunately the peace of<br>
      the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> was shattered when they encountered 
      another race<br>
      upon <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a>, the frost giants.<br>
      It was with great surprise that the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> woke 
      up one day<br>
      to find their home under siege by an army of giants. The frost<br>
      giants inhabited the <a href="eastern%20wastes.htm">Eastern Wastes</a> and 
      considered those lands<br>
      their home. They did not take kindly to the puny children of
      <a href="brell_serilis.htm">Brell</a><br>
      building a fortress along their border. After much battle, the<br>
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> realized they could not possibly hold 
      out against their<br>
      large foes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      In desperation, Colin Dain led them from their new home in<br>
      the <a href="great%20divide.htm">Great Divide</a> to the only place they 
      could go--deeper into the<br>
      mountains. The frost giants pursued, so a small group of dwarves<br>
      volunteered to stay behind to allow the others to escape. Colin<br>
      Dain himself led the suicide ambush, buying his people enough<br>
      time to escape the giants. From this time onward the dwarves<br>
      would refer to themselves as the <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> in honour of their<br>
      beloved leader. Furthermore, the leader of their people would<br>
      carry the title &quot;Dain.&quot;</font><p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      While hiding out in the frigid caverns a Coldain miner by the<br>
      name of Glight Snowchipper received a vision from 
      <a href="brell_serilis.htm">Brell</a>. The<br>
      vision was of a labyrinth of ice where the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> could hide<br>
      from the frost giants. In the narrow passageways, it was hoped<br>
      that the giants would become lost and fall into the many traps<br>
      the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> would construct. Glight presented his idea to Dain<br>
      Frostreaver, the son of Colin Dain, who began construction of<br>
      the labyrinth. The <a href="crystal_caverns.htm">Crystal Caverns</a> were completed in a little<br>
      under half a century. The speed of the project alone was proof to<br>
      the <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> that Glight had indeed been inspired by 
      <a href="brell_serilis.htm">Brell</a>. These<br>
      <a href="crystal_caverns.htm">caverns of Crystal</a> would be the salvation of the 
      <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> race.<br>
      The true test of the caverns worth came nearly thirty years<br>
      later, when by following a party of <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a>, the frost giants dis-<br>
      covered the location of the <a href="crystal_caverns.htm">Crystal Caverns</a>. Slagd Frozentoe of<br>
      the frost giants led the invasion force of warriors to the cavern,<br>
      hoping to wipe the hated <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> from 
      <a href="velious.htm">Velious</a> once and for all.<br>
      Glight Snowchipper, in the fashion of Colin Dain, led the<br>
      defense, drawing the frost giants deep into the confusing caverns.<br>
      His magical pickaxe, aptly named Snowchipper, felled many a<br>
      giant's as the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> struck repeatedly from hidden passages<br>
      and around shadowy corridors. <br>
      Despite losing most of his force, Slagd and the remaining<br>
      giants almost made it to the <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> city in the center of the cav-<br>
      erns when Glight pulled off his greatest and final trick.<br>
      Thousands of tons of ice and stone crashed into Slagd and his<br>
      remaining giants after Glight and a few of his brave miners led<br>
      them down a false passage. Unfortunately it was an act of self-<br>
      sacrifice as Glight and his fellows were also buried in the avalanche. The miners of 
      <a href="thurgadin.htm">Thurgadin</a> still call themselves Snowchippers, <br>
      in honor of Glight.<br>
      Over the next few centuries strange creatures began migrating<br>
      into the <a href="crystal_caverns.htm">Crystal Caverns</a>. It was these foes and more which even-<br>
      tually caused the dwarves to abandon the caverns and set out to<br>
      build a new fortress more akin to Frostkeep. I was cautioned to<br>
      avoid the old caverns, as they still hold many dangers.<br>
      The Coldain retreated even deeper into the <a href="great%20divide.htm">Great Divide</a>.<br>
      Led by Dain Frostreaver II, they founded the city of<br>
      <a href="thurgadin.htm">Thurgadin</a>, or New Froststone. <br>
      Constructed on the northern edge of the <a href="great%20divide.htm">Great Divide</a>,<br>
      <a href="thurgadin.htm">Thurgadin</a> lies within a glacial mountain rich with untouched<br>
      supplies of velium and other ores. The outer region of the city is<br>
      carved into the ancient glacial ice, while the inner region pierces<br>
      the mountain rock where the precious ores are mined. <br>
      The <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> are determined not to lose this home. 
      <a href="thurgadin.htm">Thurgadin</a><br>
      is built in a very defensive manner, with passage through long<br>
      tunnels lined with murder holes being necessary to get to the<br>
      inner city. At the heart of the city lies <a href="icewell%20keep.htm">Icewell Keep</a>, where the<br>

      Surrounding the castle are the forges and shops that make up<br>
      the mainstay of <a href="coldain.htm">Coldain</a> commerce. Mines burrow deeper into<br>
      the mountains, some ending in cleverly hidden and easily col-<br>
      lapsible escape hatches for easy access into the

      have used my meagre cartography skills to fashion a map of<br>

      Hanns,<br>
      When I get back to <a href="qeynos.htm">Qeynos</a>, I'm going to knock a few of your<br>
      teeth out. I'm still not sure how you convinced me to make this<br>
      trip, though I'm thinking Crow's Special Brew had something to<br>
      do with it.<br>
      Leaving the new dock in <a href="desertofro.htm#Northern Desert of Ro">North Ro</a>, I took a launch that<br>
      carried me out to the <a href="iceclad%20ocean.htm">Iceclad Ocean</a>. There I boarded<br>
      IceBreaker, a so-called ship constructed by the <a href="gnomes.htm">gnomes</a>. Several<br>
      other people had booked passage for this voyage and were await-<br>
      ing my arrival, including my comrades Tolan, Breen, and Solist. <br>
      It wasn't a fun trip. The ship's hammers were constantly<br>
      clanking and banging, those blasted <a href="gnomes.htm">gnomes</a> were making silly<br>
      pirate noises, and it was cold. It nearly drove me crazy. <br>
      We finally made landing at a beachhead the <a href="gnomes.htm">gnomes</a> 
      constructed, but found little in the way of luxuries. The gnomes even<br>
      managed to misplace the horrible rum that kept us warm during<br>
      the voyage. And before you ask, I had nothing to do with that<br>
      misplacement.<br>
      After looking around the landing, the group of us decided to<br>
      head west, beyond the area the <a href="gnomes.htm">gnomes</a> had explored. We passed<br>
      quite a few interesting sights, and a tower I really wanted to<br>
      inspect, but Solist and Breen both said to avoid it, so we continued on. After crossing a bridge that was so high it made even me<br>
      dizzy, our luck ran out.<br>
      A group of well-organized giants took us by surprise.<br>
      Deciding discretion was called for, I managed to duck out of the<br>
      battle when it was obvious we were losing. Several people, including Solist, managed to escape, while Breen went down fighting,<br>
      buried under a pile of giants. After the dust settled, I saw the<br>
      giants carrying Breen off to the southwest and decided to follow<br>
      them.<br>
      After a few hours of sneaking along, I was startled by a voice<br>
      behind me. Tolan! The clever ranger had escaped the giant<br>
      ambush the same way I had, and was tracking the giants and me<br>
      across the wastes. We continued to follow the giants, and even-<br>
      tually came to a great <a href="kael.htm">fortress city</a>. <br>
      With luck and skill, the two of us managed to sneak inside<br>
      the city. We tried to find Breen, but there was no way to know<br>
      for sure where he had been taken. The chance of getting caught<br>
      was high, since the place was crawling with giants. We eventually<br>
      passed through the city itself, and found ourselves on the edge of<br>
      a <a href="wakening%20lands.htm">huge forest</a>.<br>
      The giants were working hard to push the forest back, but<br>
      according to Tolan, they weren't doing well. He said he felt great<br>
      power in the woods, stronger even than the heart of <a href="faydark.htm">Faydark</a>. I<br>
      didn't question his statement; I could feel the life here myself. <br>
      At Tolan's urging we left the <a href="kael.htm">giant city</a> behind and travelled<br>
      on through the forest. Tolan grew more and more excited, saying<br>
      he felt we were nearing something amazing. <br>
      Tolan's woods lore gave us no warning when a group of<br>
      strange flying creatures suddenly appeared. Finding ourselves<br>
      quickly captured, we were trussed, blindfolded, and gagged. We<br>
      were carried to the heart of the forest where a gathering of beings<br>
      awaited us. They would not speak to me. But they jabbered with<br>
      Tolan for a long while in a strange language.<br>
      Again I was blindfolded and carried through the forest. After<br>
      some time I was put down and my bonds cut. I was at the edge<br>
      of a clearing, facing the <a href="kael.htm">giant city</a>. Tolan was there, unbound and<br>
      smiling. He told me I should make my way back to the 
      <a href="iceclad%20ocean.htm">Iceclad<br>
      Ocean</a>. I wasn't welcome in this land, and to go any further west<br>
      would be a bad idea. Dragons would kill me if I entered the<br>
      shrine they had built on the other side of the forest. That is if I<br>
      made it that far, since there was always the chance that the for-<br>
      est creatures would decide to have me for lunch.<br>
      When I asked Tolan what he was going to do, he said he<br>
      would be staying there for a time as a guest. He was a grown<br>
      man; I assume he knew his own business. Not wanting to over-<br>
      stay my welcome, I took Tolan's advice and said goodbye. I went<br>
      back through the <a href="kael.htm">giant city</a> (still no sign of Breen), across the<br>
      wastes, and eventually, back to the shores of the 
      <a href="iceclad%20ocean.htm">Iceclad Ocean</a>,<br>
      where I sit now. <br>
      I'm going to head back out again soon to look for Breen,<br>
      Solist, and the others. I wouldn't feel right abandoning them at<br>
      this point, and besides, it could turn out to be profitable.<br>

      As you can tell by reading the transcripts, there is much<br>
      more to <a href="velious_map.htm">Velious</a> than we first imagined. The war among the<br>
      dwarves, giants and dragons, suggests great opportunity for us,<br>
      if we choose our allies carefully. <br>
      If you have any further questions, you need only ask, and I<br>
      shall endeavor to find answers for you.<br>
