      Pulling a blanket tightly about him, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> 
      shook off the chill of the night air. Firelight licked the scars on his 
      weathered cheek as he turned his head toward the glow of the outpost in
      <a href="theoverthere.htm">The Overthere</a>. Two pinpricks of violet 
      looked back at him -- the eyes of a <a href="darkelves.htm">Dark Elf</a>. 
      The dark-skinned prowler had crept around their camp for several nights, 
      preying on any creatures hungry enough to investigate the mellow aroma of 
      mead and stew. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> sensed no ill-will from the
      <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elf</a>, as evil as his innate tendencies may 
      be, and told <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> to leave him be; let him 
      satisfy his curiosity and need to hunt. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;He is much like us <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; she said. &quot;I 
      feel he may have some part to play here.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal Di`Xevar</a> kept still, his body pressed 
      against the cold earth. He shivered slightly as the wind blew silvery 
      strands of hair across his face. He felt the <a href="barbarians.htm">
      Barbarian</a> look at him; the <a href="erudites.htm">Erudite</a> see into 
      him. <br>
      <br>
      It had been a long time since he'd felt a need for companionship, but he 
      did now. Many times he considered returning to his place at the outpost 
      under his master, Vaean the Night, even though it would be the end of him.
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> was tired of being alone and having no 
      purpose.<br>
      <br>
      As he crouched, <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> became lost in a nightmare 
      in his memory. He replayed the night he chanced upon an open tome in 
      Vaean's study; one that made clear that he was ripening
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> for a vile necromantic ritual. Vaean 
      planned to have <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> become one of his many 
      mindless minions. That very night, <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> fled 
      the outpost while his master slept. <br>
      <br>
      Since then, <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> learned to live off of his 
      wits and the fruits of <a href="kunark.htm">Kunark</a>, defending himself 
      with his sword and dark magic and calling upon the undead to aid in his 
      hunting. <br>
      <br>
      But, two days ago, <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> felt eerily drawn back 
      to the outpost. As he carefully crested a hill near the outpost, he 
      spotted a boat on the shore and two travellers of the likes he'd rarely 
      seen. <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> knew they were aware of his 
      presence, yet they did not attack or approach. <br>
      <br>
      He crept closer this night, inexplicably desperate to talk to the male and 
      female. He felt confident he knew enough of the Common language to convey 
      his harmless interest in them.<br>
      <br>
      Having been lost in reflection, <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> froze as a 
      hand gripped his shoulder. Instinctively, he crossed his right arm in 
      front of him, drew his sword and pivoted on his right foot, swinging the 
      blade in a wide arc. A shock ran up his arm as an expert parry stopped his 
      blade short.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> looked up and met the steely gaze of
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a>.<br>
