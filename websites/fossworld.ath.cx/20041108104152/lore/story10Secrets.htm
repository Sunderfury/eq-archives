      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Chalky fingers wiggled through a crack in the wall, deftly whittling the 
      mortar and stone apart a little further. The fingers disappeared and then 
      a muffled, repetitive thud came from behind the wall. There was a loud 
      crack as the stone wall split apart. With one more thud the stones in the 
      wall broke free and marked the mossy ground. <br>
      <br>
      All was still for a moment.<br>
      <br>
      Slowly, a dusty figure squirmed sideways through the fracture in the wall 
      and worked its way outside. Coughing quietly and wafting the dust from his 
      face, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> squinted as he adjusted to 
      the light of the day. <br>
      <br>
      He reached back behind the wall and pulled out a number of lightly packed 
      bags that clanged as they shifted in his grasp. A grin broke the sternness 
      of <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> face. Delighted about the 
      treasures he lifted from the deepest halls of <a href="chardok.htm">
      Chardok</a>, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> made his way to his camp.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> appeared out of the heavy mist, waving 
      his bags.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Do you have enough to satisfy you for now?&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> 
      asked dryly. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;There is no such thing as satisfied, me dear,&quot; snickered
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> showed <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      a scribbled note that was delivered earlier that day from an
      <a href="desertofro.htm#Oasis of Marr">oasis in the deserts of Ro</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The <a href="solusek%20mining%20co.htm">Solusek Mining Company</a> has 
      sent word that the kobold tribes are more active than usual. The
      <a href="gnomes.htm">gnomes</a> made mention of some sort of uprising. If 
      the kobolds cause a great enough disturbance in 
      <a href="solA_solseks%20eye.htm">Solusek's Eye</a>, it will be 
      interesting to watch if nothing else,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> said. &quot;These activities may 
      open up great opportunities for us should they reach as deep as
      <a href="solB_nagafens%20lair.htm">Nagafen's 
      Lair</a>.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> eyes lit up.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I know those lands well,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said. &quot;I 
      remember them from my travels as a youth. We servants often accompanied 
      our masters during journeys beyond <a href="neriak.htm">Neriak's</a> 
      gates,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> grinned, happy to be of greater 
      value to <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="nedaria.htm">
      Nedaria</a>.<br>
      <br>
      Excited about a new adventure, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      gathered the ever-increasing number of adventurers around him and gave 
      them the order to start packing up the camp. It wouldn't be long before 
      the adventurers would hoist the sail on the Thorn of the White Rose. <br>
