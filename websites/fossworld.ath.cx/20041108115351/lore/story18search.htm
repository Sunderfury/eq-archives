      In the warm air of the <a href="commonlands.htm">Commonlands</a> tunnel,
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> closed his eyes and began running 
      through the countless images and visions filling his mind. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I see snow, ice, and a great magic with no face. There may have been a 
      face once, but it is gone now,&quot; he whispered. &quot;There is little more to 
      that, I'm afraid.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> stood close and kept her hand on his 
      forehead, helping him slow the rush of thoughts. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">
      Morden</a> took notes in a code only the most trusted of the
      <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> could understand.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Now I see blood. Lots of blood. The dead are walking, breathing, 
      reanimating. They are unholy and feed in the most despicable ways. I see a 
      castle . . . but there is much underground. Much more,&quot;
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said. <br>
      <br>
      There was a pause as <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> searched his 
      thoughts. Suddenly, he winced and his face lengthened.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Confusion, fear. The walls are collapsing and sand is rushing in. Half 
      blood, half sand. Now they are all in sand. They do not know that the 
      wrath of <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek Ro</a> has passed,&quot; he said in 
      low tones. His cheeks glistened with tears of sadness.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> chest heaved as he took a deep breath. 
      He paused again. Under his eyelids, his eyes fluttered wildly. <br>
      <br>
      The hush around them was broken as <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> 
      gasped so suddenly that air whistled through his teeth.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Oh my, the paladins are lost. I see the frogloks blessed by
      <a href="mithaniel.htm">Mithaniel Marr</a> are transformed. A curse holds 
      their souls. I feel the burning hate of a god,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">
      Calliav</a> panted. &quot;And the orcs. The orcs have risen. Goblins have been 
      overrun and enslaved.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> 
      looked to <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>. In both of their eyes,
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> read the need for confirmation of
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> ramblings. In many ways, the 
      possibility of undiscovered lands felt too good to be true.
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> also had trouble believing that he 
      could have ever missed such places in his travels.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> looked at both of them and nodded. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;These visions he is sharing are not fantasy. They are real. There is much 
      strife deep within the earth . . . and darkness,&quot; she said.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> turned around to see proud members of 
      the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> sharing past 
      adventures and creating new stories as they ambled about. He cleared his 
      throat.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Listen up brothers and sisters. Our time has come. Pack your goods and be 
      prepared to travel. <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> will lead a camp to 
      the Frigid Plains and Northlands on <a href="antonica.htm">Antonica</a>.
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> will lead some of our brethren across the
      <a href="ocean%20of%20tears.htm">Ocean of Tears</a> to the
      <a href="butcherblock.htm">Butcherblock Mountains</a> on
      <a href="faydwer.htm">Faydwer</a>,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      said. &quot;I will remain here with <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and a 
      greater compliment of the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers 
      Brotherhood</a>. We are about to open the doors to the future of all 
      Norrathians, I expect. Off with ye!&quot;<br>
