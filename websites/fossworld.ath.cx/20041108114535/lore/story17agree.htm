      The tunnel between the <a href="commonlands.htm">Commonlands</a> and the
      <a href="desertofro.htm">deserts of Ro</a> bustled with traffic. The 
      presence of the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> 
      caused quite a commotion as passersby came to see what all of the fuss was 
      about.<br>
      <br>
      The merchants in the area were making their fortunes off of the boisterous 
      band of friends. Mead, beer, bread, and grand meals were passed amongst 
      the brotherhood. Laughter and loud voices bounced within the sandstone 
      caverns.<br>
      <br>
      But in one corner it was quiet. <br>
      <br>
      A dark, graceful hand rested on <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> pale 
      forehead. His skin shone with beads of perspiration and his eyes were 
      desperate and sunken.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Do not fight me, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>. I can help you, but 
      you must open your mind to me,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> said 
      softly.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I cannot. If I open my mind again, I shall lose myself entirely,&quot;
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said and shuddered.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We need to work together to bring order to your thoughts. If you don't 
      harness this now, you will be lost in any case,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">
      Nedaria</a> said sternly.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> quivered and a drop of anguish slid down 
      his temple. He tried to overcome his fears and frenzied thoughts. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Alright <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>. I am putting my trust and 
      sanity in your hands. Don't lose either of us,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">
      Calliav</a> groaned.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> leaned in and increased the pressure of 
      her hand on <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> brow. He shifted his 
      weight forward into her palm. He squinted as he focused on releasing his 
      mind.<br>
      <br>
      Soon, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> felt a calming essence enter his 
      mind. While his mind rattled with images and voices, the torment he felt 
      for days started to fade some. <br>
      <br>
      The hood around <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> sleek forehead began 
      to tremble lightly. Her arms and hands followed. A stabbing pain throbbed 
      in <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> mind as she connected with
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> to help him focus his mental energy. She 
      felt the frenetic pace of his thoughts, the number of them, and the 
      magnitude of their meaning. Though she could not see <a href="Calliav.htm">
      Calliav's</a> visions, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> felt a sorrow 
      unlike any she'd ever known. That this poor mage's spirit survived at all 
      was miraculous to her.<br>
      <br>
      She released her grip and leaned back against the cold wall, rubbing her 
      burning temples.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> stopped shaking. He opened his eyes and 
      stared directly at <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;You must help me find the Grozmok Stone. Agree to surrender the stone to 
      me when it is found and I promise to offer you what information I can. 
      What I can tell you may lead you to lost civilizations, dark horrors, and 
      creatures that you've never seen wandering the lands of
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> 
      said, as his gaze shifted from <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> to
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> had been standing above them both, 
      ready to break their intellectual bond should something go wrong. Upon 
      hearing <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> request, he looked down at
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> with surprise and understanding.
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> nodded to him, knowing
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> was not looking at her, to indicate that
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> could not have been more serious about 
      his request. She stood up briskly and went to talk to <a href="tondal.htm">
      Tondal</a> so that <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> could discuss the proposal.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Surely this is folly, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>. We have seen all 
      there is in these lands,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;No, there is much that you have yet to see and when you do you may regret 
      having ever really opened your eyes,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> 
      warned.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;With that kind of introduction, how could I possibly say no,&quot;
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> beamed as he laid a hand on the 
      troubled mage's shoulder. &quot;So, where do we start?&quot;</font><p>
