      The filthy waters lap rhythmically at the shores of
      <a href="theoverthere.htm">The Overthere</a>. A well-worn boat parts the 
      veil of lazy mist hanging still in the air as it makes its last strides 
      toward land. The strained hull groans softly as it swims toward the sands, 
      finally grating onto the shore.<br>
      A tall, tattered figure stands at the bow. His stature and the breadth of 
      his shoulders give away his <a href="barbarians.htm">Barbarian</a> 
      heritage. His eyes, grey as the waters, flit along the sands toward the 
      outpost looming nearby as he assesses the immediate dangers. <br>
      <br>
      Seemingly satisfied, he walks amidships, puts a hand on the side of his 
      boat, Thorn of the White Rose. He jumps over the edge to land knee-deep in 
      water with barely a splash or sound. <br>
      <br>
      With that landing, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> took another 
      step on the path of a rumour -- one that set him upon the waves and one 
      that he intends to follow to its end. He has heard of trouble amongst the
      <a href="sarnak.htm">Sarnak</a>. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> walks from the surf to a steep incline 
      where grains of sand meet the grass. He leaves no trace; no footprints. As 
      his body rises up to a ledge, he crouches in perfect relationship, his 
      presence barely detectable.<br>
      He sees no trace of passing patrols, only wildlife wanders nearby as the 
      wilful rogue kneels motionless and quiet for a short time. The deep 
      creases in <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> brow begin to smooth as 
      he sees no enemies. In feline movements, he moves back from the ledge. On 
      the sands once again, he turns and slips silently back to the boat. </font><p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      &quot;All is clear <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>,&quot; he says in a voice that 
      travels on the air in soft baritones. &quot;It looks like we found ourselves an 
      adequate spot. I need to survey the area before we set up camp though. 
      Come down.&quot;<br>
      A hardened <a href="erudites.htm">Erudite</a> face peers over the side of 
      the boat at <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>.<br>
      &quot;Lend me a hand?&quot; she asks as she folds back the sleeves of her robe.<br>
      &quot;I shall, but you must read my fortune tonight,&quot; he says, with a slanted 
      grin.</font><p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      &quot;You never do anything for free, do you?&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> 
      huffs as she lowers the scruffy rope ladder. <br>
      He holds her gently as she carefully makes her descent onto the sands. </font><p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> 
      turn and walk up the beach together. They are age-old companions, moved by 
      loyalty to one another and adventure...anywhere.</font><p>
