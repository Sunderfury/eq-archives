      The leaders of the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> -- 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a>, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria Debeian</a>, 
      and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal Di'Xevar</a> -- stood together in the 
      <a href="commonlands.htm#East Commonlands">East Commonlands</a> tunnel, 
      looking over the heads of jolly <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> initiates to where 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> sat quietly in a darkened corner with his back to the commotion. 
      For days, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> had been fiddling with a stockpile of mystical gems and 
      stones that brotherhood members were turning up. For the past few hours he 
      had been arranging the gems and stones in runic patterns all about him and 
      mumbling incantations like none had ever heard.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;<a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> sure 'as been quiet of late, ain't 'e? I wonder what's goin' on 
      in that wild mind of 'is, hm?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said as he glanced from 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> to 
      his closest friends who stood facing him.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;He is greatly troubled <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, but he's also doing his best to find us 
      answers...even though we already know some answers he seeks,&quot; 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> 
      eyes turned to the floor as she uttered the words.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Now <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>, chin up, eh? The time will come for us to tell 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> more 
      about ourselves, but for now we must focus on these tales and visions of 
      peril that 'e keeps spoutin', hm?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> suggested as he rested his 
      scarred right hand on <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> gently sloping shoulder. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> interrupted.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;<a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, my logic tells me that 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> must be going mad again. That side 
      of my mind just can't fathom that we are in any great danger,&quot; 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> paused a moment before he caught 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> with the intensity of glowing 
      violet eyes. &quot;But, I confess, my heart tells me that all he says is true. 
      It also tells me that <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and this unseen foe he speaks of are what 
      brought us together in the first place.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a>. I know ye are a big believer in fate. I won't dismiss what ye 
      say, but I think we're best of friends because we have like hearts, not 
      because of grand design...but then, perhaps I'm more salty than I ought to 
      be, eh? I been thinkin' there's a brambly path ahead of us, me friends, 
      but I 'ave no doubts that we'll find our way if we stay true to each 
      other, hm?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> grinned in his usual optimistic fashion.<br>
      <br>
      It was then that a blinding flash of blue light filled the tunnel. A 
      shockwave of magic followed it and blew everyone off their feet. In an 
      instant, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>, and
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> found themselves tangled together on 
      the tunnel floor next to a wall. <br>
      <br>
      In the aftermath, an eerie quiet saturated the tunnel. Soon after, groans 
      echoed throughout the caverns as everyone gathered their wits and stood 
      up, all eyes reflecting confusion and concern. <br>
      <br>
      Suddenly an agonized cry broke the stillness. It was a familiar voice.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> was on his feet and moving before anyone could discern the source 
      of the pained wailing. He was running toward a faint glow at the back of 
      the tunnel. It was <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>.<br>
      <br>
      As <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> approached, his jaw dropped in surprise and horror. An eerie 
      light pulsed out of <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> skin as he lay writhing on the tunnel floor.
      <br>
      <br>
      &quot;<a href="nedaria.htm">NEDARIA</a>! Get over here please, NOW!&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> yelled. It was seconds before 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> forced her way through the growing crowd of onlookers.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> stopped still when she saw him.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I've never seen anything like this <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. Ever,&quot; she said, as she 
      started to kneel next to <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>, afraid to touch him. <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> shuddered and choked out some words.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Mord...en...<a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>...hear me...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What is it sprite? Are ye alright? Ye look a darned mess mage,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said, trying to lessen the biting mood of fear in all of them.<br>
&nbsp;</font><p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;I've seen... ahh... our... path. You... mu... 
      must... build... great... sh... ship... bigger... biggest... all of Nor... 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> must... make a journey,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> curled up and coughed. The 
      magical light from his flesh began to ebb some.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;A ship? What is this? We've already got the Thorn of the White Rose, me 
      friend. Why would I need another?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Trust in...me. I have seen what we... must... do. We are making... a... 
      journey... as one... west... one purpose... all must come together. 
      Please... we must... be... quick... doom... death...&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> voice 
      trailed off and his eyes rolled back. His body went still.<br>
&nbsp;</font><p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Nedaria forgot her reservations and bent 
      over <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>, resting her hand on his forehead trying to read or sense 
      what happened to him. As she focused her mind, her eyes shut so tightly 
      that deep wrinkles carved into her weathered face. <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> pushed his way 
      to where <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> and <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> stood, his eyes settling on them both, 
      flickering with worry. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> voice was muddled and trembling as she spoke from under her 
      robe's hood, still crouched next to <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;He's gone. He's drawn within his mind, I believe. I can't reach him and I 
      doubt anyone can. I must say, I do not know what to make of this at all, 
      except one thing <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; she stood up and faced 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a>. &quot;We 
      must do as he asked.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I won't question ye <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>. Not now. I've not seen anything like this meself,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> stated firmly. <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> nodded as he rubbed his aching 
      shoulder that had slammed into the tunnel wall with the blast of magic.<br>
      <br>
      Just hours after <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> put his adventurers to task, 
      <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> 
      scouts returned to him with a perfect location to build a ship. Morden had 
      made it clear that the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> wouldn't be building just any 
      ship, but one as big and as beautiful as any of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath's</a> cities. <br>
&nbsp;</font><p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Not fully understanding the purpose of his 
      new ship, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> felt he should spare no expense. He put out a call for 
      the best and brightest of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath's</a> engineers and shipwrights to be ready.
