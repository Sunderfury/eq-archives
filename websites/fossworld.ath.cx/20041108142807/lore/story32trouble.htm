      &quot;I think I understand, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> spoke quietly as he examined the 
      strange platform in Yxtta, one of the temples in <a href="taelosia.htm">Taelosia</a>. &quot;It's some kind 
      of time device, like a clock.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ye gotta be kidding. That thing? Not a chance. Seems like it might be a 
      key or riddle. It opens that cave behind us. Really . . . must you read 
      into everything?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said in a gruff tone, clearly frustrated. <br>
      <br>
      The two adventurers found their way through some of the trusik temples 
      until they stumbled on a peculiar device. <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> insisted they figure out 
      what it was for. That was days ago. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;It's more than just a key, my friend. I'm sure it's about time. I think 
      it's counting backwards. From what I've learned from some of the 
      Taelosians, the Muramites reset this time-keeping machine at the same 
      moment they began chanting at a portal near one of the temples. We have to 
      get there soon. Something is bound to happen,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said with some 
      urgency. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> had been staring off into the sky as
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> spoke, his expression 
      vacant. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;The sooner we get this entire bloody business over with the better, 
      <a href="elves.htm">elf</a>. 
      I want to get back to <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> and see 'ow she's fairin',&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;You just don't care at all about the intricacies, do you? I've tried my 
      hardest to learn ways to end the suffering of these people. This has got 
      to be a clue. Sometimes I think you are more of a <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elf</a> spirit than I, 
      old man,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Who are ye callin' 'old'? We were sent to get that blasted amulet for 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>. That's what I wanna do. 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> is of greater importance than any 
      of your crazy ideas,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> growled. &quot;Without 'er, we're nothin'. Ye are 
      a . . .&quot; <br>
      <br>
      His voiced trailed off as he did his best to get a hold on his temper. He 
      was thankful for all that <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> had done and did believe that the 
      Muramites were up to no good. His anger wasn't directed at 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a>. His 
      heart and stomach had felt twisted and choked ever since he heard of 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> illness. He was emotionally exhausted and his physical strength 
      was failing him too. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;We need to get movin' to that temple and get that amulet now,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. &quot;We can send scouts and sages up here in droves if we need to. Look, 
      we 'ave spent enough time 'ere and can report what ye've found,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> ordered. &quot;What ye've done is admirable, but we 'ave to get back to the 
      Queen of Thorns.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> sensed <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> fright and panic about 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> many days ago, but 
      chose not to discuss it then. As it was, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> good humour had all but 
      vanished and he was quiet -- too quiet for the boisterous 
      <a href="rogues.htm">rogue</a> the <a href="darkelves.htm">dark 
      elf</a> had come to know. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> was so preoccupied that it was getting 
      dangerous to travel with him and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> didn't want to risk both of them 
      dying because <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> wasn't focused. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Frankly, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, I think it's too dangerous to take on this task. You are 
      too distracted right now and have almost gotten us killed a couple of 
      times,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said, trying to be honest, but also preparing himself for 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> wrath and insults. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> shot him a steely glare and then turned his eyes to the rocky 
      ground. He sighed, his strong shoulders slumped slightly. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, I know me mind's been a bit off and I'm sorry. I 'aven't been 
      without <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> for years and the spark of chance of 'er dying . . . well, 
      I'm sure ye know already that it don't sit well with me,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said 
      quietly. &quot;I will promise ye that I'll keep me 'ead on straight if we can 
      leave now and just get this done.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Agreed. Let's continue on,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said, picking up his satchel and 
      sword. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> eyes brightened at the thought of adventure and danger.
      <br>
      <br>
      &quot;You know,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said, lightening the mood, &quot;you get a sick pleasure 
      from facing impossible odds.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> grinned for the first time in days as they crept their way 
      to the temple called Tacvi. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      It took them two days to navigate their way to Tacvi, having spilled a lot 
      of blood, including some of their own. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I'm almost out of energy,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> complained while he cleaned some fresh 
      Muramite blood from his sword. &quot;I don't know how we're going to make it, 
      especially if that amulet is well guarded.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;We 'ave it under control, friend,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said, reassuringly. &quot;<a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> 
      already said that a fierce creature guards that amulet, but somehow we'll 
      make it through okay. 'e's not been wrong yet, 'as 'e?&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, 'tis true, but I'm leery,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Be leery, then. I won't be . . . 'eads up!&quot; with blinding speed and 
      feline grace, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> pushed past 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> and sunk his dagger deep into the 
      belly of a pouncing 
      <a href="story19bvisions.htm#3. The Ukun -- War Hounds of the Legion of Mata Muram">ukun beast</a>. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I really 'ate those things,&quot; he said while <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> stood stunned for a 
      moment, collecting himself. &quot;Let's go. We're close. I want ye to stay near 
      that doorway just ahead when we get it open. We cut the chatter now, so do yer usual signs and shouts if we get ambushed, hm? Ye may 'ave to fight on 
      yer own.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I can handle myself. You're not that good,&quot; 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said, patting <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> on the shoulder, noticing the caked blood and dirt on his chain pauldrons. 
      They both carefully opened the stone door and took stock of the 
      surroundings. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> left <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> at the doorway near the main chamber in the temple. He 
      masked his movements as he became one with the shadows. 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> was able to 
      see him well with his ultravision and watched other shadows and doors for 
      danger. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> moved out of the shadows, his raised right eyebrow dug lines of 
      confusion into his forehead. The temple chamber was eerily silent. <br>
      <br>
      There was a plain stone altar in the middle of the room. Even 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> could 
      see a gold chain hanging over the side of it. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> circled the altar at 
      a great distance, looking for traps or some sign of danger. He found none.
      <br>
      <br>
      He moved to the altar carefully and examined it. Wary, but satisfied it 
      was safe, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> carefully grabbed the chain and as he held it up, he 
      found himself looking at a large swirling gem in a glowing setting. He 
      slipped the amulet into a small leather satchel on his belt and nodded to 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> as he walked quietly across the stone-tiled floor toward him. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I don't know 'ow, but we 'ave it,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said, with a sliver of 
      nervousness. &quot;Too easy. Way too easy. I'm almost disappointed.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Best not to question it now. Let's get out of here and back to the ship,&quot; 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said. <br>
      <br>
      As they turned to leave the chamber, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> had an uneasy feeling that 
      they were being watched. He turned abruptly. <br>
      <br>
      There, far beyond the altar, the <a href="rogues.htm">rogue</a> swore he saw the blurred edge of a 
      shadow slink back into the darkness. </font> <br>
