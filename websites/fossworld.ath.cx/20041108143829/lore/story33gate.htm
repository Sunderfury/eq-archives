      With the Muramite commander's amulet tucked into a leather pouch on his 
      belt, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal Di'Xevar</a> made their way quickly to the shores 
      of <a href="natimbi.htm">Natimbi</a>. Getting home was much simpler after they learned of an ancient 
      stone that allowed them to magically bypass the treacherous mountains of 
      <a href="taelosia.htm">Taelosia</a>. <br>
      <br>
      It was only a matter of days before the two leaders of the brotherhood 
      were back aboard the Queen of Thorns in the <a href="abysmal%20sea.htm">Abysmal Sea</a>. 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> demeanour 
      was troubled and sour for the entire trip, no matter how many times 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> tried to lift his spirits about the reports they'd gotten about their dear 
      friend, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria Debeian's</a>, failing health. <br>
      <br>
      With a determined gait, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> pushed through the throngs of those 
      welcoming him home and headed straight for <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> quarters. When he 
      laid eyes on her, he felt the beat of his heart in his temples. His hands 
      shook at his sides. She was far worse than he dared dream.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> skin was grey and cracking and he saw the bloodshot whites of 
      her eyes as her eyelids fluttered. Her breath came as laboured wheezes as 
      she lay curled on her side, shivering and unconscious. 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> crouched 
      beside her bed and grasped her thin, bony hand. He saw her fingernails 
      were even splitting and gnarled.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Lass, what 'as happened to ye? What 'ave I done?&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> pleaded with her 
      quietly. &quot;This would 'ave never 'appened to ye if I'd let ye live a life 
      on yer own. I should've never dragged ye 'ere. I will 'ave ye taken from 
      'ere at once.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> felt a hand on his shoulder and was instantly irritated, shrugging 
      it off. He turned up to see the saddened gaze of <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and his mood 
      softened some.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We can't move her <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. There is some protection here for her with the 
      magic around the ship. It's keeping a lot of the dangers out,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said. &quot;We are working night and day to try to learn what is happening to 
      her. Whatever it is has attacked her mind and her body is following. But 
      she is still with us <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, I can feel her presence everywhere. We just 
      need time.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> sensed that, as usual, 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> had more to tell him, so he waited 
      expressionless while his eyes were fixed on <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> withering face. 
      After a thick silence, the mage spoke.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We need to consider going there . . . uhm . . . to the realm of the 
      Muramites and our sages are ready to start putting their knowledge of the 
      Taelosian portals to work and then we can . . .&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> continued to 
      ramble as <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> stood up and held his palm up in front of Calliav's face, 
      stopping him from talking.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What?! What in <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath's</a> grace are ye babblin' about?&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said, his 
      eyes wide. &quot;Are ye actually proposin' that we rebuild that portal that 'as 
      been the bane of the wee people of Taelosia? I'm sorry, but 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> is the 
      first priority. Frankly, mage, I'm tired of you leadin' us to our doom.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> couldn't help but lash out at 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and didn't feel apologetic 
      about it. There was a slight edge in <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> voice as he replied, his 
      voice a little deeper and more confident than usual. It caught 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> ear and made his gut a little uneasy.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;<a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> can only be saved if we do build it. I think there is something 
      over there that has grappled her mind in magic, but I don't know what. 
      That amulet I sent you for could give us some answers,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> looked 
      almost hungry as he searched Morden for any sign of the bauble. 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> had 
      seen greed countless times before, and often felt it himself, but had 
      never seen it in <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> before.<br>
      <br>
      Reaching into his pouch to get the amulet, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> kept his eyes on 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> who was nearly salivating. He held the glowing amulet in his hand for a 
      moment, a sickly feeling overtaking him.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What do ye know about this thing, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>? What is it for?&quot; he asked.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I don't know for sure, I just know that I was meant to have it and study 
      it. I haven't said much about it, but someone or something is guiding me 
      and I believe and hope it to be <a href="zebuxoruk.htm">Zebuxoruk</a> himself. Why would he abandon me 
      after touching me with his knowledge? I believe he wants us to know more 
      -- I've felt a presence . . .&quot; he said, almost with urgency, his eyes 
      never leaving <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> hand.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I fear yer actin' a little odd me friend,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. &quot;I 'ave never 
      questioned yer requests, no matter 'ow mad they've been -- mostly at 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> behest.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      It was then that he looked over at Nedaria and saw a lazy trickle of blood 
      tracing from the corner of her mouth and landing in tiny droplets on her 
      pillow. Instinctively, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> tossed the amulet to 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and held <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> face in his hands.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Parillin, get in 'ere,&quot; as he called for <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> aide, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> voice 
      cracked and his chin began to quiver.<br>
      <br>
      The often cheerful and meddling <a href="vahshir.htm">Vah Shir</a>, Parillin, ran into the room and 
      stopped suddenly, her clawed feet scraping against the planks on the 
      floor. Her face dimmed, like someone suffocated the light of her life. She 
      had been hoping against hope that the return of <a href="MordenRasp.htm">
      Morden</a> would bring <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> out of her illness, believing the two were in love. Looking at the frail 
      <a href="erudites.htm">Erudite</a>, it looked as though she had only gotten worse. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;What do we do . . . she just . . . I don't know,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said helplessly.<br>
      <br>
      Parillin laid <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> on her back and let a few drops of a healing elixir 
      pass between her lips. Within a few moments, the blood stopped and 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> body went limp as she fell into a deep sleep.<br>
      <br>
      Somewhat relieved, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> stood up, looked at 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>, and addressed him 
      icily.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ye do what ye must and I want to 'ave that amulet back when ye are done. 
      Ye can 'ave them <a href="wizards.htm">wizards</a> work on a way to the realm, but we will only go 
      if ye can somehow prove that goin' there will save 'er. Once we unlock a 
      way to the Muramites, it means we may open the door to the end of 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;No, you can't and you won't do this,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> interrupted, having heard 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> word as he arrived to see 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>. &quot;It's absurd. We need to end 
      the threat here and seal off any way to Discord. How can you even suggest 
      this, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>? Would you sacrifice all in 
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> for <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>?&quot; he asked.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> turned to <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> and blinked slowly, calming his temper.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, me gut says no, but if there is a magic that can 'arm 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> from 
      afar, then there must be a reason they want 'er. And if those bloody 
      Muramites can 'urt any one of us from another realm then are we really 
      safe anyway? I think we're strong enough to go with the rest of the 
      brotherhood and end this once and for all. We need to hunt down this Mata 
      Muram,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> stood for a moment and considered his companion's words. 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> looked between the two of them, holding the amulet anxiously in both 
      hands, remaining silent.<br>
      <br>
      The saddened <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elf</a> looked
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> directly in the eye and nodded before 
      he walked to <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> side.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It's done, then,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. &quot;<a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> , you get on this and know I've 
      got me eye on ye. I don't mind sayin' I don't like 'ow ye've been actin'. 
      Get out now and I want ye to report to me every few 'ours. Me and this elf 
      'ere nearly died gettin' you that amulet, so ye make it worth our while.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      As <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> turned to walk out of the room,
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> swore he saw an 
      unearthly green glimmer in the mage's eyes. <br>
