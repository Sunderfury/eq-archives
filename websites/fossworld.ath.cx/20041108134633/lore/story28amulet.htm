      The dinner bell echoed across the decks of the Queen of Thorns, but 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav Giniuar</a> did not notice. He sat in bed with a tattered diary 
      resting on his raised knees, penning some words of what had come to pass 
      in the recent months. Each word became lengthened and scrawled as his 
      eyelids begin to sink, sleep overcoming him. He put the pen down and 
      closed his eyes, letting dreams wash over him.<br>
      <br>
      But he didn't have a dream, he had a nightmare. It was the sort of 
      nightmare that felt real, like you could reach out and touch the terror. 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> was trapped in sleep and could not escape the scene that unfolded.<br>
      <br>
      He saw himself walking through a temple with rotting corpses of fallen 
      heroes and friends lying at his feet. He walked into a room where a 
      withered Taelosian sat in prayer, ignoring <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> presence. In the 
      darkness, he saw someone move. He turned and saw <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> creeping in 
      the shadows, edging his way behind a terrifying creature and passing 
      through a stone door.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> yelled, but <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> didn't hear him. He ran after 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, going 
      unnoticed by all of the Muramites in the room.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> was crouched in the dark, his presence nearly undetectable. His 
      stormy eyes searched everything in the room, mapping his path. 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> saw 
      where he planned to go and ran ahead through another stone door at the 
      back of the room. <br>
      <br>
      And there he saw it, the leader of the Muramites. It was a beast unlike 
      anything he had seen. It was an oddity with a fierce chaotic energy. He 
      saw the creature wrap its spindly fingers around an amulet on its neck. 
      The amulet began to glow and the creature's eyes rolled back. He saw it 
      murmur as though it was having a conversation with someone. 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> could 
      not discern the words and was too terrified to move closer, or his mind 
      simply wouldn't allow it in this nightmare.<br>
      <br>
      Then, the creature removed the amulet and placed it on an altar. The stone 
      in the amulet was unlike anything <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> had seen. It pulsed and gave off 
      a sickly dark glow, absorbing the light around it.<br>
      <br>
      The beast slowly walked through a door and it closed. 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> found his 
      feet broke free and he was able to move. He reached out for the amulet, 
      but his hand passed through it. He was simply an observer in this scene.<br>
      <br>
      The grating grumble of moving stone came from behind <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>. He knew it 
      was <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. He turned and watched him take silent steps toward the altar, 
      examine it, and check it for traps. Satisfied it was safe, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> reached 
      down and picked up the amulet by the chain, careful not to touch the 
      stone. He took out a small leather bag and slipped it inside, pulling the 
      bag's string taut to close it. As <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> turned to walk out of the room, 
      the scenes of the nightmare began to fade to darkness -- but 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> did 
      not feel alone in his mind. He felt a presence like a parasite, burrowing 
      and digging into his thoughts.<br>
      <br>
      From the darkness, the image of the amulet glowed and spun in his mind. It 
      had secrets, mysteries to unlock. <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> didn't want more visions. He 
      didn't want to feel compelled to put his friends into more danger, but the 
      more the amulet's image filled his mind, the more his resolve turned. He 
      must have it. Yes, he must get it as soon as possible. He saw 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> get 
      it safely. It should go well, he thought.<br>
      <br>
      With a start, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> awoke from the dream and sat up. He gathered his 
      robes about him and set off to find <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, who was happily seeing the 
      remaining hours of the day out with some ale in the ship's mess. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ahoy there, me strange mage. What will ye have this fine eve of 
      adventure?&quot; Morden bellowed across the tavern as 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> walked in.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>, embarrassed, shuffled quickly to the table. He begged 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> to 
      speak to him in a quiet corner.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I don't like that look on yer face <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>. I really 'ate it when get 
      THAT look,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> sighed, as they walked into a quiet room across from 
      the rowdy bunch of wayfaring folk.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I know I've asked a lot of you, but there is another thing I must ask. I 
      will pay you and the brotherhood to do this,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said, his voice 
      quivering.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I won't take yer coin, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>. You've done more for the minds and hearts 
      of these adventurin' folk than ye'll ever fully know, no matter what the 
      danger,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said with smooth, warming tones. In his mind, though, he 
      wouldn't mind more money . . .<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The leader of the Muramites here holds an amulet . . . at least I think 
      he does. It's important somehow. It comes directly from another realm and 
      still may have ties there. I think it's used to communicate from this 
      realm to another,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said hastily. &quot;I don't know why I must have it, 
      I just know I need it. It has secrets, wonders . . .&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Good grief. Slow down, eh? Fine. I've been stuck on this boat long 
      enough. I'll leave soon and go get this . . . amulet. Where will I find 
      it?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> asked.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;That's it? You'll do it?,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said with a measure of disbelief.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Of course. Ye still don't understand me, do ye? Me life revolves around 
      attaining the impossible. Why wouldn't I do it? Now, where shall I find 
      it?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> ask.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It's in the highest temple at the farthest reach of 
      <a href="taelosia.htm">Taelosia</a>. There is a 
      creature there -- a fierce one and it is very well protected. I get the 
      feeling you will have no trouble there, but most others will. Don't ask me 
      why,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said and 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> detected some doubt.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I'm going to ask why. I don't like yer tone,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said sternly.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This vision I had wasn't like the others. It felt a little odd,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> replied.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ye've not been wrong yet, so I'm sure ye're right about this -- just like 
      ye were right about all else,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. &quot;I'm going to pack me gear and 
      start getting ready. I'll take <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> with me.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> left <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> to his drink and returned to his quarters. He felt a 
      dark presence surround him and grew cold. He tightened his robes around 
      him and closed his eyes for a moment.<br>
      <br>
      He cried out as two dark glaring eyes stared back at him in his mind.<br>
