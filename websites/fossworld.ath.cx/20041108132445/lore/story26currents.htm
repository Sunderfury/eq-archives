      As the bevy of shipwrights and <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> crew readied to take 
      the hulls of the enormous ship in <a href="nedarias%20landing.htm">Nedaria's Landing</a> out into deeper waters 
      to finish the final details, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> stood at the bow of one of the 
      hulls. He looked proud. Wisps of chestnut hair free of his leather hair 
      tie wafted around his coarse face. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria Debeian</a> was warmed by watching 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> stand there, knowing he was 
      lost in great memories of adventures -- ones she had shared with him.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I been thinkin' lass,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said to 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> without turning to see she 
      was standing behind him. &quot;I've got me an idea for a name o' this 'ere 
      boat. What do ye think o' Queen of Thorns, eh?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I'm supposing you believe that everyone in our brotherhood is somehow a 
      thorn in someone's side, hm?&quot; she said smiling.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, mostly mine. I love 'em, but . . . I'm just not a leader -- not like 
      they expect me to be. I'm just an adventurer findin' 'is way in this 
      world, ye know?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said thoughtfully. &quot;I don't know 'ow we ended up 
      'ere . . . life used to be so simple when we 'ad no one else. I 'ave no 
      regrets, as ye know, but I'm not sure I'm ready for what 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> says 
      might be down the road.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The time for your selfishness has passed, so has the era of you proving 
      yourself to those who doubted you. Face it, friend. You may have grown 
      up,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> said, with a grin. &quot;We should embrace this opportunity and 
      guide those who want to join us. We have a lot to offer as a result of our 
      experience in this world.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Don't ye go trying to be funny now,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> jibed. &quot;But I suppose ye're 
      right. Bein' selfish was a lot easier, though. Ha.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Slowly, the smile he wore peeled from his face, the glint wore from his 
      eyes. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I don't think I can do it, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>. I don't think I can be the hero these 
      folk think I am. I'm just an ole <a href="barbarians.htm">barbarian</a> lookin' for adventure 'ere and 
      there. I don't want to disappoint 'em,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said, his eyes passing over 
      freshly glossed planks.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;They love and follow you for who you are now, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> said. 
      &quot;They expect no more from you than you've already given -- your charm, 
      confidence, friendship, and love of exploration. They idolize you only 
      because they can see that being outcast is not the end of the world, that 
      they can make it on their own and do great and wonderful things.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Bah, enough of the flattery,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> interrupted, the glimmer returning 
      to his gaze. &quot;You'll make me too soft-hearted, darned, meddlin' 
      <a href="erudites.htm">Erudite</a>. 
      Ye sure are pretty though.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> shook her head and smiled.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Just keep your wits about you, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; she said as she turned to leave 
      and inspect the ship.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> stayed on the bow to consider their conversation. He turned in time 
      to see <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav Giniuar</a> walking toward him.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;'Ello mage. Always grand to see ye up an' about,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Thank you, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. Do you have a moment?&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> asked.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Certainly. Why don't ye come up 'ere and 'ave a look at this view and 
      we'll chat a while,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> walked up to <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and stood next to him, both of them watching 
      the whitecaps foam and fade as the waves churned on the 
      <a href="abysmal%20sea.htm">Abysmal Sea</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I know where we're going and no one has been there, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> spoke suddenly. 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> put his left elbow on the rail and faced
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>, 
      staying silent.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We're going to be going to a part of the <a href="abysmal%20sea.htm">Abysmal Sea</a> that has never been 
      navigated. It's never even been breached. That's part of the Grozmok 
      Stone's secret and why I needed to find it. It turns out it's . . . well, 
      in rudimentary terms, it's a compass,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said, waiting for 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> to 
      grow a look of a surprise, but it didn't come.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, go on,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said, his eyes fixed on 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We must discuss the possible route across the sea. Please, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, only 
      invite your most trusted brothers or sisters,&quot; he added. &quot;This is an 
      adventure that is not to be treated lightly . . . all of our lives may be 
      at risk.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;So ye keep saying. I've not seen a trifle of danger 'round 'ere,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It's not here . . . it's in a place yet undiscovered, a new land we've 
      never seen,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said, slowly. &quot;<a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, hear me. Look at me . . . we 
      will see things and creatures none could dream of -- and I know you have 
      seen a lot -- but not this . . . not this at all.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I really 'ate it when ye talk in riddles, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>. I don't want to say, 
      but, truth be told, it's startin' to rub me the wrong way,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> smiled.
      <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I want to tell you everything, but some things will have to be seen to be 
      believed, even for me,&quot; <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said. &quot;I know I've sounded crazy, and said 
      many a strange thing, but what we will find will be stranger still.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;So, what do we do now?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> asked.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Collect your best navigators and shipwrights,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> said. &quot;We need to 
      start plotting a course that will take us deep into the 
      <a href="abysmal%20sea.htm">Abysmal Sea</a>. The 
      time for our journey is nearly upon us.&quot;<br>
