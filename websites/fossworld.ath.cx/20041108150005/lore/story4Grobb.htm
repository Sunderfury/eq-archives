      <font face="Bookman Old Style">Only days before, they had walked from the murky comfort of
      <a href="innothule.htm">Innothule</a>, bringing with them a message from 
      their god. The elders waited for them in the glow of <a href="guk.htm">
      Guk's</a> stony mouth, anxious yet unaware of the dramatic change they 
      were about to discover. The firepots' aura met the first of
      <a href="mithaniel.htm">Mithaniel's</a> chosen as they stepped out of the 
      water's dark grasp and made their way ashore.<br>
      <br>
      The elders were mesmerized. Their eyes were transfixed on the glory that 
      their lord had bestowed upon their fellow citizens. Still, the fully 
      transformed <a href="frogloks.htm">frogloks</a> seemed natural, though the 
      evidence of their blessings was far from subtle. They were, after all, 
      merely an evolution; a reminder of the power that the heavens hold over 
      the mortal realm.<br>
      <br>
      Within hours of their return to <a href="guk.htm">Guk</a>, the chosen of
      <a href="mithaniel.htm">Mithaniel</a> moved frantically to prepare. 
      Several days of prayer, fasting, and planning allowed them to convey the 
      urgency of their visions to the elders and citizens of <a href="guk.htm">
      Guk</a>. They had emerged from the swamp with not only a new form, but 
      also a plan for what would become a new age in the annals of
      <a href="frogloks.htm">froglok</a> lore. They had been given a clear 
      vision of conquest: <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a> would fall beneath them.<br>
      <br>
      Weakened by the loss of their relic and the disappearance of their 
      greatest heroes, the citizens of <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a> sat unaware 
      in the morning gloom. Their minds were on the ocean and the black waters 
      that were swallowing their kin, a crucial distraction for the interlopers' 
      plans. The <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> of <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a> 
      were wading through the quicksand of despair, blind to the final blow that 
      was gathering in the shadows just outside their city's gates.<br>
      <br>
      Not unlike the <a href="frogloks.htm">froglok</a> elders, the Bashers were 
      mesmerized when their eyes first caught sight of the faces that emerged 
      from <a href="innothule.htm">Innothule's</a> waters. However, the 
      enthralling sight was not glorious to them, but rather a horrific vision. 
      The first thoughts that came to them were of their god. An epiphany 
      occurred simultaneously among the small crowds of trolls. As they stood on 
      the familiar shores of <a href="innothule.htm">Innothule</a>, each one 
      began to understand... they must have somehow angered their god... and the 
      assault that was coming towards them must be his final act of retribution.<br>
      <br>
      The battle lasted only hours. From the first call of alarm, to the moment 
      the last of the terrified <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> scurried into 
      the <a href="feerott.htm">Feerrott</a> and the sands of
      <a href="desertofro.htm">Ro</a>, the <a href="frogloks.htm">frogloks</a> 
      were clearly blessed. The <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> were reduced to 
      an almost primal state. Those that stood and fought were quickly reduced 
      to a smouldering and broken mass; evidence of the true power of what would 
      be called the Guktan army. The Lance of <a href="mithaniel.htm">Mithaniel</a> 
      could only triumph in their mission. <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a> stood 
      decimated before them.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="grobb.htm">Gukta, the outpost of Marr</a>... The visions that 
      awaited them in the waters of Innothule that first night were not wrong. 
      As the first light of morning broke through the haze and smoke of battle, 
      the <a href="frogloks.htm">frogloks</a> worked quickly to erect proof of 
      their victory. Before the noon sun reached its pinnacle, the city was 
      transformed. <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a> was no more.<br>
