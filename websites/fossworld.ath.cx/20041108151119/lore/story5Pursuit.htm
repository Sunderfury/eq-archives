      <font face="Bookman Old Style">An icy breeze whistled across the hills, 
      parting the fog around a worn dock. The ship creaked and groaned with 
      effort as the salty crew brought her in towards the shore. A slight elf 
      quickly nodded to an <a href="erudites.htm">Erudite</a> captain before 
      disembarking the ship. He nimbly slipped past a Kejekan fisherman, 
      completely unnoticed, before disappearing into the mountains. <br>
      <br>
      The midnight journey through the black waters had been nerve-wracking. 
      Throughout the voyage, the crew had muttered charms of warding as they 
      worked, their eyes searching the darkness for signs of marauding ships. 
      The cargo hold of the old ship had been cramped, and the food bad, but he 
      had made it. The trip was well worth it, as he had made a marvellous 
      discovery and needed to bring word to <a href="kelethin.htm">Kelethin</a> 
      at once. He had found a way to the island.<br>
      <br>
      As the <a href="darkelves.htm">Teir`Dal</a> turned their thoughts to the 
      sea, so did many keen minds across <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. News 
      of <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb's</a> fall, along with rumours of piracy and 
      great powers, spread to the far reaches of the realms. Councils were held 
      amongst city leaders and factions, debating what should be done in this 
      changing of the times. It had been so long since an event of this 
      magnitude surfaced, that the oldest sages were called forth to address 
      this development.<br>
      <br>
      The once peaceful seas had become places of danger and robbery, and the 
      power emanating from the <a href="gulf.htm">Gulf of Gunthak</a> could 
      conceivably pose a threat to all of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. 
      Trade lines that crossed the sea were severed, packages sent by normal 
      means did not reach their intended destinations, and communication between 
      the continents would have been lost without the powers of magic. Many 
      factions sent scouts to the <a href="gulf.htm">Gunthak region</a>, with 
      orders to bring back information on the prophecy, the Grozmok stone, and 
      the mysterious Broken Skull Clan. <br>
      <br>
      Travellers quickly realized that passage to Broken Skull Rock would prove 
      most hazardous, as the pirates now ruled the seas. The increasing power of 
      this renegade band had spread through the <a href="gulf.htm">Gulf of 
      Gunthak</a> and the Buried Sea, making travel all but impossible.<br>
      <br>
      One particularly astute scout of <a href="tunare.htm">Tunare</a> searched, 
      seeking to determine a safe route to Broken Skull Rock. In his travels, he 
      happened upon a smuggler transferring goods to the island through a remote 
      dock in the <a href="stonebrunt.htm">Stonebrunt Mountains</a>. This was 
      far from the normal routes the pirate ships patrolled. After a bit of 
      bargaining the <a href="elves.htm">elf</a> procured passage on his ship. 
      This proved to be a reliable method for reaching Broken Skull Rock, 
      although the journey is dangerous and gives no guarantee of safety upon 
      arrival.<br>
      <br>
      When the scout returned to <a href="kelethin.htm">Kelethin</a> with the 
      news, messengers were sent at once to other key figures across
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. To aid the cause, the
      <a href="arcane%20scientists.htm">Academy of Arcane Sciences</a> and the
      <a href="druids.htm">Druids</a> of <a href="surefall_glade.htm">Surefall</a> 
      devised new magics for swift travel to the <a href="stonebrunt.htm">
      Stonebrunt mountains</a>. As copies of these spells made their way into 
      the hands some of the shadier merchants in the <a href="commonlands.htm">
      Commonlands</a>, adventurers of all sorts began heading to Broken Skull 
      Rock. A variety of motivations drove these aspiring heroes to Odus: Some 
      sought treasure, some looked to exact revenge upon the clan that had 
      wronged them, and some felt the call of a higher cause. <br>
      <br>
      In <a href="faydwer.htm">Faydwer</a>, many feared that the
      <a href="darkelves.htm">Dark Elves</a> might gain possession of the stone 
      and warp its power for their own, twisting and bending the world to do 
      their bidding. This must not be allowed to happen. If the hand of
      <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a> had reached this island and empowered 
      such foul creatures, what other horrors could be in store for the 
      civilized realms... and what new tragedies could befall the ever-changing 
      face of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> in the years to come?<br>
