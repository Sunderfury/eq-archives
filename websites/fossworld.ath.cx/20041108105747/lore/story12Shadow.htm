      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> quietly reminisced about her youth. No 
      one in <a href="erudin.htm">Erudin</a> had known she was different. As a 
      young free-spirited <a href="erudites.htm">erudite</a>, she discovered she 
      had an innate power to see into people's minds and overcome the boundaries 
      of the present to glimpse into the future.<br>
      <br>
      She remembered the first foreboding dream that came to her. One of the 
      nobles of <a href="erudin.htm">Erudin</a> was planning to murder his own 
      son who threatened to replace him and ascend to the city's council. <br>
      <br>
      After rising from her sleep that night, she ran to her mother, Tilisea 
      Nebeian, who was studying at the grand table in the library of their home. 
      She tugged at her mother's robe and told her the nightmare she had. <br>
      <br>
      Her mother first smiled with delight as she entertained the wild musings 
      of her child. Then, as <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> continued, her 
      mother's face twisted in fear. She quickly hushed <a href="nedaria.htm">
      Nedaria</a> and ran into the storeroom, frantically throwing supplies into 
      a satchel. Tilisea grabbed her daughter's arm tightly and dragged her 
      quickly through the city and out into the darkness of the
      <a href="toxx.htm">Toxxulia Forest</a>. She crouched in front of
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> and handed the satchel to her. With 
      tears glistening in her eyes, Tilisea held her daughter's face in her 
      hands. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Run now little one. You cannot stay here. The nobles will learn of your 
      gift and rob you of all you hold dear -- your mind and talents. Talk to no 
      one. Let your senses guide you. I will seek you out soon,&quot; Tilisea said in 
      a single rush of breath. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> was terrified and confused, but turned 
      from her mother and ran as far and as fast as she could. Her tears 
      streaked her soft cheeks as she sobbed. <br>
      <br>
      It had been many years since that night and she never heard from her 
      mother again. Her heart withered knowing that her mother may have paid a 
      dear price for saving her. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria's</a> time within her memories ended 
      abruptly as a sense of gloom passed over her -- a presence she was not 
      familiar with was nearby. She looked up from the necklace she was crafting 
      and saw nothing. She rose from her seat on a crate of blankets and turned 
      her eyes to the east.<br>
      <br>
      In the heat haze and geysers of steam, the shimmering outline of a 
      humanoid figure moved closer. It was a shadow that moved without the need 
      of an object to cast it. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> heard of shadowed creatures in
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> that could move in the light of day. She 
      also recalled that they were to be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      The figure then crept backward behind the steam. <a href="nedaria.htm">
      Nedaria</a> followed, believing that this creature of shadow would have 
      already attacked had it wanted the blood of those in the camp.<br>
      <br>
      Down the hill, under the gentle flapping wings of a fire drake, Nedaria 
      waited alone. She sent out a soft voice from her mind, hoping it would 
      reach the creature. In the Common tongue of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>, 
      she repeated, &quot;I am here to listen if you have something to say.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      A gravelly voice whispered into her right ear. She remained motionless.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We seek the same enemy. The servants of <a href="solusekro.htm">Solusek 
      Ro</a> need to be cast out. You know as well as I that this is the only 
      path to true magical power. It is our place to rule the world. The pure 
      and true magic of the Shadowed men is the only art,&quot; it said. &quot;I can help 
      you if you can help me. I can promise you power.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      With her back to the Shadowed man, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> 
      listened as he told a tale of greed among the Solusek kobolds and a 
      growing resentment of the resident lord, the mighty dragon,
      <a href="nagafen.htm">Nagafen</a>.<br>
