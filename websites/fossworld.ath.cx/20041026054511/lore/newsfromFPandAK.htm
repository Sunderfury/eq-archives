      The streets of <a href="freeport.htm">Freeport</a> have been overtaken by 
      greed and turmoil. The conflict between the <a href="dismalrage.htm">
      Dismal Rage</a> and the law-abiding citizens of <a href="freeport.htm">
      Freeport</a> has reached a boiling point. New heroes have been called on 
      to aid both sides in the constant power struggle of this city. Numerous 
      guildmasters <br>
      have advanced the training that is given to all those brave enough to rise 
      from <a href="freeport.htm">Freeport</a>, either for good or for evil. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The <a href="commonlands.htm">Commonlands</a> have also started to see 
      strange new individuals and even stranger creatures. There is also word 
      that the <a href="clan_deathfist.htm">Deathfist Orcs</a> have begun to 
      stockpile supplies for an unknown reason. Citizens knowing the nature of 
      the <a href="clan_deathfist.htm">Deathfist Orcs</a> are preparing 
      themselves for anything. <br>
