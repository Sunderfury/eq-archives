      Prime Heirophant Vek leaned over and looked into the jewelled case 
      silently. The young mystic behind him nervously fingered the cudgel 
      hanging from his belt. He knew what was coming. The hold of the faceless 
      had firmly taken hold of his heart and was beginning to squeeze.<br>
      <br>
      Vek turned to him quietly and simply said, &quot;Find them.&quot; He then walked 
      silently out of the room.<br>
      <br>
      Hierophant Zand turned to the young Mystic, &quot;Do as he has asked. Do not 
      return until you have the skulls of the ancients in your possession.&quot; The 
      young Mystic stumbled as he ran out of the room, visibly shaking.<br>
      <br>
      Zand looked down into the empty skull case. Something glittered softly in 
      the corner of the case. Zand reached in and picked up a small earring, 
      emblazoned with the symbol of the Kunzar.<br>
      <br>
      Zand walked quietly out of the room, and somewhere the soul of a dead 
      emperor laughed with unholy malice.<br>

      Halor slashed frantically at the creature before him. He swung down hard, 
      cleaving the great worm in two. Unfortunately there were many more were 
      that came from. Bauric climbed over a rock and stood next to Halor, 
      fighting off another of the worms.<br>
      <br>
      Halor suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right heel and spun violently 
      around, causing his journals to fly out of his pack and onto the hard 
      stone floor. He swung at the worm larva with his sword knocking it away, 
      but too late. The worm had wounded him badly, he could no longer hold 
      himself up on the wounded ankle and he fell to the floor with a crash. 
      Bauric cried out in pain as one of the larger worms bit into his arm. That 
      was the last thing Halor saw before the horde of worms squirmed across the 
      stones and overcame them.</font><br>
