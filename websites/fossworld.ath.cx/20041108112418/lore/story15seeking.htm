      Trapped in the chaos of his mind, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> 
      continued to stagger through the <a href="pop.htm#Plane of Knowledge">
      Plane of Knowledge</a> for many days, aching for calm and relief. <br>
      <br>
      As he wandered, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> caught the murmurs of 
      passing Norrathians. There was talk about a band of adventurers, the
      <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a>, that had garnered a 
      great reputation of success with uncovering intrigue, information, and 
      treasures.<br>
      <br>
      It was clear to <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> that he ought to seek 
      out the leader of this crew of explorers, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden 
      Rasp</a>. He would send a messenger to request his help very soon. In the 
      meantime, <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> had to continue his research 
      into the repeated, haunting vision of a glowing stone. He believed it to 
      be the magical stone that was stolen from the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> 
      -- the Grozmok Stone. <br>
      <br>
      While in the <a href="lavastorm.htm">Lavastorm Mountains</a>,
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>, 
      and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> received word that a raving madman in 
      the <a href="pop.htm#Plane of Knowledge">Plane of Knowledge</a> was 
      seeking their assistance to find an object -- a stone -- of grave 
      importance. Naturally intrigued, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      wanted to learn more, but was uneducated about travel to and from the 
      planes. Twice he had sent messengers to get word to the lunatic, but had 
      heard nothing more.<br>
      <br>
      If the news about the madman was true, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> 
      and his friends might face their greatest adventure yet.
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> 
      were well aware of the history of the Grozmok Stone and were very curious 
      to see if the madman might know more about it. The idea was an alluring 
      proposition for another reason -- now that <a href="MordenRasp.htm">
      Morden's</a> band of outcasts and exiles rivalled any powerful group of 
      explorers on <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">
      Morden</a> wanted to prove the worth of his legion to the world. In some 
      small way, he hoped word about the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers 
      Brotherhood</a> would make its way back to the Rogues of the White Rose in
      <a href="halas.htm">Halas</a> -- the ones who cast him out in the snowy 
      wilds. But, mostly, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> was confident his 
      new family could take on any challenge. No one knew how to face adversity 
      like him and the rest of the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers 
      Brotherhood</a>.<br>
      <br>
      Morden's second messenger returned, finally, and told
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> that the madman, named
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>, could arrive on <a href="norrath.htm">
      Norrath</a> at any time and that he would most likely find his way to the 
      city of <a href="freeport.htm">Freeport</a>. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> agreed to lead the growing camp in the
      <a href="lavastorm.htm">Lavastorm Mountains</a> while
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> 
      ran to <a href="freeport.htm">Freeport</a>. <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> 
      was familiar with the underground labyrinth of the sewers of the city. <br>
      <br>
      The two companions ran with the shadows in <a href="nektulos.htm">Nektulos 
      forest</a> and slipped past the guards in the <a href="commonlands.htm">
      Commonlands</a>. <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> led
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> to the hidden entrance to the
      <a href="freeport.htm">Freeport</a> sewers. As they crept through the 
      darkness, they came upon a pedestal holding a book. It emitted a power 
      that made the hair on the back of <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> 
      neck stand on end. <br>
      <br>
      The two edged their way around a corner to observe this strange object 
      pulsating with magic. It wasn't long before a low hum stirred from the 
      book on the pedestal. The sound had such a deep resonance that
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> teeth chattered.
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> felt his chest vibrate as he watched a 
      puddle of slime ripple at his feet. <br>
      <br>
      The two shared a confused glance when a crimson glow began to fill the 
      slippery tunnels of the sewer. <br>
