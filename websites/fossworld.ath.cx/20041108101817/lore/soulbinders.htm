      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a> (and on <a href="luclin_moon.htm">Luclin</a> 
      as well). Rumour has it that these 'Soulbinders' have dedicated themselves 
      to research on the power and essence of our inner being. Some call them 
      fanatics, as they claim that knowledge of the spirit that dwells within 
      will lead them to an understanding of the whole of existence. Citizens 
      often treat them with the same respect and distance that they treat the
      <a href="priest%20of%20discord.htm">Priests of Discord</a>. However, these 
      Soulbinders have dedicated themselves to public service, and for them that 
      service falls along their lines of specialty...<br>

      services of a Soulbinder.</font><br>
