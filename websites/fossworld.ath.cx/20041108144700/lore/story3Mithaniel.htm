      The <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> are clumsier than usual, their hurried 
      movements carrying them between <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a> and the 
      seashore. They pour forth from their city's walls, distractedly searching, 
      almost as if it were all in vain. Knowing that what they seek is beyond 
      their immediate grasp, they continue to act out the role in an effort to 
      pass the time. The curious <a href="frogloks.htm">frogloks</a> are 
      uncertain about the nature of the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a>' loss, 
      but they understand that they are certainly no longer a priority.<br>
      <br>
      Deep within the damp walls that lie beneath the swamp, a mail-clad 
      amphibian stands within the semicircular gaze of the council. He speaks in 
      the tongue of his people, confident and proud, yet devoid of emotion. &quot;We 
      watched them as you requested. It is confirmed. They have sent their 
      soldiers to the sea. The crusaders have left their home. Only a smaller 
      force remains to defend it. All that you have sent us to observe has 
      occurred. We have nothing else to report.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      The elder <a href="frogloks.htm">frogloks</a> nod and the scout quietly 
      leaves their chamber. Silence lingers in the room, as they all think about 
      the inevitable future they share. Their waiting is coming to an end. Again 
      they will stand before their champion in prayer. Only this time it will be 
      to confirm their destiny as a people. The elders move in silent 
      preparation and in unison they begin their prayer, &quot;Lord Ralthazor, 
      Champion of Marr, Herald of Prophecy, hear us as we are prepared...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      The soft echoes of activity fill the halls with an energy that agitates 
      the long stagnant air. There is movement in every corridor, as bodies pour 
      towards the epicentre of their fate. Tonight is like no other they can 
      remember. An assembly of all of the castes is unheard of in their society, 
      and perhaps the elders had this in mind when they announced it. There may 
      be some logic in shaking things up prior to an even greater upheaval.<br>
      <br>
      As the room falls into silence, the elders from each caste rise before the 
      crowd. The room seems to dim as they begin to tell the story of their 
      people. The history from which they came spreads out before them. The 
      story and the visions it conjures dance above the crowd. The elders speak 
      for hours, as the decades move across the walls of the great hall. The 
      massive gathering begins to understand, this must be what it is like for a 
      stone to watch life travel by. The understanding that stems from the 
      elders words begins to speak to the crowd and the elders move aside, as 
      the pale flames of purity rise and begin to illuminate the room.<br>
      <br>
      The white and blue flames dance along the walls, a voice fills the minds 
      of the individuals that make up the crowd.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Do not fear these flames, for they are the sanctuary that will protect 
      you from the darkness. Your task will be to wait on the edge of destiny, 
      peering into the darkness in search of a light. This light, the light of 
      destiny, already shines within this room. It radiates from within your 
      ranks.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      While the bulk of the crowd stares, mesmerized by the movement of the 
      flames, several of the listeners begin to make out an image. It steps out 
      of the flames and speaks only to them.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;There are some among you that see my true form. You see me for you are 
      the chosen. I speak to you, because you have found true understanding of 
      yourselves. It is only through that understanding that you may march 
      forward and dispel the dark grasp of fate. You shall carry with you the 
      destiny of your people and act as beacons for those that will wait, safe 
      from the hate and fear that surround you. You will be the lance of valour 
      that pierces the heart of those seeking to oppress your people. You are 
      the seeds of a new age.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      These words follow the chosen <a href="frogloks.htm">frogloks</a>, as they 
      make their way to their quarters. Unable to sleep, they find themselves 
      thinking of <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a> and the <a href="trolls.htm">
      trolls</a> that reside there. Images of battle begin to fill their minds. 
      Feeling drawn by the night, many of the witnesses to tonight's activities 
      leave their quarters and begin to filter towards the cool comfort of the 
      swamp. Perhaps they will find peace there or at least some sign of what 
      they should do next.<br>
