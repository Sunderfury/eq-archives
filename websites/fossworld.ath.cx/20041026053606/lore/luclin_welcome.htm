      &quot;As you know, youngster, we of the <a href="league_bards.htm">League of 
      Antonican Bards</a> have made it our primary goal to travel to places 
      before others. It is our duty to see what hasn't yet been seen and to make 
      song of it when we return. We carry news, song and spirit to all of
      <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. We have also taken it upon ourselves
      <br>
      to carry personal news in the form of letters wherever possible. And 
      that's what I've called you here to talk about. <br>
      <br>
      No, I am not assigning you the duty of establishing a mail route into
      <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a>. We've lost far too many young bards trying 
      to do that. Recruitment of smart young lads and lasses is nearly 
      impossible when they all think that we plan to send them out to become
      <a href="Bards.htm">bard</a> fillet. We've only been able to recruit <br>
      youngsters that no other guild wanted because they were so... <br>
      <br>
      No, of course I don't mean you. <br>
      <br>
      Now stop interrupting. <br>
      <br>
      I have a job for you. You know, don't you, that <a href="alkabor.htm">
      Al'Kabor</a> has once again been clomping about using his powerful magics 
      without much regard for consequences, don't you? <br>
      <br>
      /em sighs. <br>
      <br>
      Ok, your first task is to read up on current events! (Read
      <a href="luclin_journal.htm">Al'Kabors Journal</a>!)<br>
      <br>
      Your second task is to find out if the rumours about his recent 
      experiments are true. They say (and &quot;they&quot; are pretty reliable) that 
      things such as noble-looking Kerrans calling themselves the
      <a href="vahshir.htm">Vah Shir</a>, strange beasts of burden and new 
      spells and songs have started showing up on Antonica. They also say that 
      this is all due to the experiments of that <a href="erudites.htm">Erudite</a>
      <a href="wizards.htm">Wizard</a> <a href="alkabor.htm">Al'Kabor</a>.
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">You are to head out to one of the great
      <a href="wizards.htm">wizard</a> spires and investigate. If you can, 
      interview one of these <a href="vahshir.htm">cat people</a> and bring us 
      back one of these <a href="horse.htm">horses</a> they talk about... <br>
      <br>
      Maybe you should talk to my assistant about things like directions out of 
      the city and where you can find some shoes more appropriate for travel.&quot;
      <br>
      <br>
      All this you overhear as you wait outside for your turn to talk to the 
      loremasters of the <a href="league_bards.htm">League of Antonican Bards</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      The door opens and you see a dejected and confused looking young
      <a href="Bards.htm">bard</a> step out. Following him out the door you hear 
      a bellow, <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I also expect you to let everyone know that we are NO LONGER trying to 
      establish mail routes to <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a>! Trolls can't read 
      very well anyway.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Shadows of <a href="luclin.htm">Luclin</a> opens up new adventures and new 
      challenges, as well as new rewards for those with a spirit of adventure.
      <br>
      <br>
      Are you up to the challenge?</font><br>
