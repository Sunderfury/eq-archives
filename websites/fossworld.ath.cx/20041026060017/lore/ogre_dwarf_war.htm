      <b>Of the Rakthokian Kingdom and general Dagnor:</b><br>
      <br>
      For centuries while the elven empire grew to the east, the
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> and <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> had 
      thrived in the mountains to the west, surrounding the forest presently 
      known as &quot;<a href="faydark.htm#Lesser Faydark">Lesser Faydark</a>.&quot; The
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> settled into the jagged cliffs of what 
      is known as the <a href="butcherblock.htm">butcherblock mountains</a> and 
      there had established their golden kingdom of <a href="kaladim.htm">
      Kaladim</a>, &quot;The forge of <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>.&quot; The
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> were able to <br>
      wrestle control of nearby lands from the orcan hordes of
      <a href="faydwer.htm">Faydwer</a> after a decade of warfare and 
      established the first ogreian kingdom in the nearby Rakthokian ridge 
      mountain range, named after the first <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> leader 
      &quot;Rakthok the Warlord.&quot; There in the <a href="faydark.htm">Faydark</a> west 
      the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> and <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> 
      lived in an uneasy peace. <br>
      <br>
      While the immense empire of the <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> could have 
      easily crushed either one of the kingdoms, the <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> 
      saw the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> as a primary concern. Raised in 
      a culture where only the strength in your arms and the size of your weapon 
      mattered, the <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> of the kingdom of Rakthok 
      considered only the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> to be their equal 
      and thus a very large threat. The <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> were also 
      greedy of the gold-rich mountain mines and the stone cutting skill of the
      <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a> kingdom, and to make matters worse, the 
      friendly disposition of the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> did not 
      agree with the savage and chaotic tendencies of the Rakthokian ogres. What 
      resulted was an intense racial hatred and many small fights between the 
      two kingdoms. <br>
      <br>
      In the beginning of the second age, when the elven rebels against the god
      <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a> began to surface, Dagnor the Butcher 
      was chosen as the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian Kingdom. Clearly the most 
      ambitious of all the previous Rakthokian kings, Dagnor was the first to 
      realize that the small skirmishes between <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> 
      and <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> would never solve anything and that for 
      the <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> to gain anything substantial, the
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> would have to be completely overcome or 
      slaughtered. He saw the mines of <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a> as an 
      infinite source of limitless wealth and power. Almost immediately after he 
      seized the throne Dagnor began to assemble the largest combined army of
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> since the orcan clans had been overthrown. 
      Dagnor was held in check for a long time, however, because
      <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a> was a chief source of gold and weapons 
      for the elven empire and the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> would find 
      the <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> a strong ally if war broke out. The
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> king was smart enough to realize that his 
      kingdom could not survive an attack from both sides and so he did not 
      advance and the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> did not regard him as 
      much of a threat. While the indomitable elven empire loomed over western
      <a href="faydwer.htm">Faydwer</a>, war was not an option for either the
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> or the <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a>.
      <br>
&nbsp;</font><p>
      <font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>Of the attacks on Northern
      <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a>: </b><br>
      <br>
      Dagnor is sometimes referred to as the destroyer of two empires. When he 
      began his campaign against the dwarven kingdom of <a href="kaladim.htm">
      Kaladim</a> he began the fall of his own kingdom of Rakthok, but also he 
      stopped the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> from giving aid to the elven 
      empire against the ever increasing elven rebel armies. Many historians 
      surmise that if the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> had not been pulled 
      into war <br>
      with the <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a>, their help would have caused the 
      downfall of the rebel army and the old elven empire would still be in 
      existence. <br>
      <br>
      In any case, with the war of the broken crown raging to the east, Dagnor 
      knew the <a href="elves.htm">elves</a> could not afford to lend aid to the
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> and he took the opportunity to launch 
      his own campaign against the kingdom of <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a>. 
      The warlord knew that the key to beating the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> 
      was through the less guarded lands of northern area <a href="kaladim.htm">
      Kaladim</a> where the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> had primarily <br>
      established trading centres and peaceful mining villages. So in the middle 
      of the second age, the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian kingdom marched his 
      army of <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> and orcan slaves west across the 
      hills of shade directly to northern <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a> 
      without fear of elven intervention. <br>
      <br>
      Old <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> still tell the horrible tales of the 
      first <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> attacks. Ill prepared to meet such an 
      invasion force, the peaceful cities of northern <a href="kaladim.htm">
      Kaladim</a> were swept over with tremendous speed. <br>
      <a href="ogres.htm">Ogre</a> <a href="warriors.htm">warriors</a> burned 
      everything they could put a torch to and killed every
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarf</a> they saw be it man, woman, or child. In 
      little less then a week the forces of Dagnor had surprised
      <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a> and caused the deaths of hundreds of
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a>. The warlord had found the weakness in 
      the impenetrable kingdom of <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a> and now 
      marched directly for the capital. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Of king Grimmly Fireforge, and the battle on the hills of shade:</b><br>
      <br>
      It was Dagnor's unnecessary need to stop and make sure everything was dead 
      in the wake of his army that gave the time the <a href="dwarves.htm">
      dwarves</a> needed to prepare. Word reached the capital city of
      <a href="kaladim.htm">Kaladim</a> days before the ogres arrived. Hearing 
      the startling news of the advancing army, the 12th dwarven king Grimmly 
      Fireforge, an excellent fighter and brilliant military tactician, began to 
      assemble a defensive force. Dagnor also did not anticipate the speed by 
      which the dwarves could gather into a force large enough to repel his own. 
      It was the warlord's first mistake. <br>
      <br>
      When the army of <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> reached the Crakthorn 
      ridge, just one mile from the capital city of <a href="kaladim.htm">
      Kaladim</a>, they were met by an equally large force of
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> lead by king Grimmly. The fighting on 
      the ridge was savage and brutal, but being less skilled at fighting in 
      tight tunnels and with low light then <br>
      the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a>, the <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> 
      were forced to flee. Dagnor ordered his army into the hills of shade where 
      the <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> and <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> 
      could fight on equal ground. <br>
      <br>
      Day and night the battle raged across the hills of shade above the
      <a href="faydark.htm#Lesser Faydark">lesser faydark</a> and the grass was 
      bleached red with the blood of the fallen. Both armies were fueled by 
      soldiers from their respective kingdoms and soon the war had ground into a 
      stalemate. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Of the orcan betrayal and the battle of the shattered spear:</b><br>
      <br>
      Thinking that the war would either be won or lost on the hills of shade, 
      Dagnor ordered his southern most forces guarding the forest of
      <a href="faydark.htm#Lesser Faydark">lesser Faydark</a> to move north and 
      add more strength to the army in the hills. He left instead a handful of
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> soldiers and mostly a host of orcan slaves. 
      It was Dagnor's second and most fatal mistake. <br>
      <br>
      For the first time in history <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> and orcs 
      came to an agreement and entered in on an alliance. The
      <a href="dwarves.htm">dwarves</a> promised the orcan slaves of the 
      defeated orcan clans their freedom if they would not interfere in the war 
      in favour of both sides. Completely in favour with the plan, which gave 
      the orcs <br>
      freedom but did not require them to fight, the orcan slaves retreated from
      <a href="faydark.htm#Lesser Faydark">lesser faydark</a> to the east, 
      deserting the armies of Dagnor and leaving the southern hills wide open. 
      King Grimmly took this opportunity to assemble a second force to the south 
      and then attacked Dagnor's army from both the<br>
      front and the undefended flank. The <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> forces on 
      the hills of shade were demolished. Dagnor fled with few others and the 
      Rakthokian kingdom was now completely vulnerable. Grimmly gathered his 
      remaining forces and headed straight for the <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> 
      capital, levelling any fortresses he came to and <br>
      burning Rakthok to the ground. The Rakthokian army had been broken. <br>
      <br>
      The last official battle took place beneath the forest of
      <a href="faydark.htm#Lesser Faydark">lesser Faydark</a> as the remaining
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> forces, lead by Dagnor, attempted to flee to 
      the south. They were met there by a small force of vengeful dwarven 
      soldiers who were able to hold them off until the arrival of the main 
      dwarven host. <br>
      When King Grimmly and his army arrived, the forces of Dagnor fought 
      viciously and were able to kill many, but were ultimately defeated. A 
      story tells that Grimmly and Dagnor met each other face to face on the 
      shores of a lake to the south of <a href="faydark.htm#Lesser Faydark">
      lesser faydark</a> during one of these fights, and that Grimmly stabbed 
      Dagnor with a spear with such intensity and ferociousness that the weapon 
      shattered into thousands of pieces even as it cut straight through the
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> lord's chest. The story goes on to say that 
      the warlord fell to his death immediately in that same lake and that the 
      evil in his blood made the water boil and turn red. Thus the dwarves 
      mockingly renamed the lake <a href="dagnors_cauldron.htm">Dagnor's 
      Cauldron</a> and thus the final battle of the ogre-dwarven war was called 
      &quot;the battle of the shattered spear.&quot; <br>

      <br>
      Barely more then three hundred <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> had survived 
      from a host of thousands and, saying their prays of forgiveness to their 
      god <a href="ralloszek.htm">Rallos Zek</a> for loosing the war, the 
      survivors hastily retreated to the south-west. For two weeks the
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> fled and the forces of king Grimmly hounded 
      them at every step, killing all those they could catch up with. The
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> plundered every small city they came to, 
      even the shattered ruins of the elven capital of Caerthiel where they 
      found ships and supplies they could use. Finally fleeing all the way 
      across the Loping Plains, they set sail across the eastern oceans and away 
      from the closing dwarves. The first Ogre-Dwarven war had officially ended.
      <br>
      <br>
      The <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a>: beaten, wounded, and without a leader, 
      reached the then barren continent of <a href="antonica.htm">Antonica</a> a 
      month after setting sail from <a href="faydwer.htm">Faydwer</a>. Day and 
      night the forces of a once great Rakthokian Kingdom marched tirelessly 
      through the endless <a href="desertofro.htm">desert of Ro</a> and soon to 
      the empty mountain range of what is <br>
      now known as the serpent's spine. Wanting some time to rebuild and 
      recuperate, the <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> found the mountain's natural 
      geography a good advantage over any invasion force. Here they started the 
      foundations of a new <a href="ogres.htm">ogre</a> capital, guarded on all 
      sides by two rivers, a desert, a lake, jagged <br>
      mountains, and a thick jungle, where they could start to assemble again 
      and build a new army for the second ogre-dwarven war. They called their 
      new kingdom &quot;<a href="oggok.htm">Oggok</a>&quot; which in ogreish means 
      &quot;Revenge.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      The second age ended in war and death with the promise of a new beginning. 
      The petty squabbling of the elder races on the continent of
      <a href="faydwer.htm">Faydwer</a> had ended tragically and none of the 
      kingdoms would ever fully recover. The seeds for revenge had been sewn and 
      the entire world had changed for all the elder races. With the immigration 
      of the <a href="darkelves.htm">dark elves</a> to <a href="neriak.htm">
      Neriak</a> on <a href="antonica.htm">Antonica</a> and of the
      <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> to <a href="oggok.htm">Oggok</a>, new lands 
      had been discovered and none of the elder races had the power anymore to 
      stop the<br>
      kingdoms of the <a href="gnomes.htm">gnomes</a> and
      <a href="halflings.htm">halflings</a> of expanding nor did they have the 
      strength to control the ever increasing population of the

      sadness, and change for <a href="norrath.htm">Norrath</a>. <br>
