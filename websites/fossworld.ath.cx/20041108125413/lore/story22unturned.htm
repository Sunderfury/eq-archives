      Under a tent at the <a href="the_wayfarers.htm">Wayfarers Brotherhood</a> 
      camp on the shores of Nedaria's Landing, a groan escaped from
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav Giniuar's</a> lips and his eyelids quivered.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;<a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>, I think he's finally waking up,&quot; said 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria Debeian</a>. She had 
      been watching over <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> for days, trying to guide him back to 
      consciousness and out of his coma in any way she could. She tried potions 
      offered by various shamans in the brotherhood as well as using her gift to 
      see into and guide minds.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I guess we need to chat before 'e comes to, eh?&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden Rasp</a> replied, 
      walking over to <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a>, lending her a hand to get her to her feet. She 
      winced as she stood, putting her hands on her lower back and stretching.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I've been sitting for so long. I hadn't realized. I suppose I'm getting 
      old,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> said.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ye're as young as the day I found ye hidin' with them bloody 
      <a href="kerrans.htm">Kerran</a> in 
      <a href="eruds%20crossing.htm">Erud's Crossin</a>', me dear,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> smiled crookedly. &quot;Good thing 
      <a href="erudites.htm">Erudites</a> 
      age slowly, eh?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Your flattery won't work with me, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. I'm not as easily won over as 
      most,&quot; she replied with a hint of a smile.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye, I do know that. Always a tough one. I suppose that's one reason I'm 
      so fond of ye' always keeping me on me toes,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. With a sideward 
      nod, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> motioned to <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal Di'Xevar</a> to head to the shore. 
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> walked with the grace and silence of a panther, despite his heavy plate armour. He didn't want to disturb 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>.<br>
      <br>
      A soft breeze from the sea wove between the three friends as they looked 
      at each other, knowing the time had come to reveal the truth to 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This 'as been coming for some time and we must be prepared to lose a 
      friend over this, ye understand? I will handle the task of tellin' 'im,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. &quot;We might 'as well be ready for anythin'. I'm still not sure 
      what that mage is capable of.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;You better believe you will be the one to tell him, 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>,&quot; <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> said 
      sharply. &quot;It was your idea to keep it from him.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> just looked between the two of them. He had little to say about the 
      matter. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> felt <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal's</a> indifference and eyed him.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I suppose ye're not gonna say anythin', because ye think this was all 
      meant to 'appen this way, eh?&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> suggested.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Aye,&quot; <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> said with a shrug.
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> looked at both of them, sighed, 
      and turned away. He walked up the grassy slope.<br>
      <br>
      The mage had woken and was trying to sit up. When <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> reached the tent, 
      he helped <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> keep his balance by supporting the weak mage's back with 
      his left hand. With a scarred right hand, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> worked a flask out of his 
      satchel and handed it to <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> so he could drink some water. 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> took a few sips before looking into 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> eyes.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What is troubling you, <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>?&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> asked in a raspy voice.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I need to talk to ye, but I was goin' to wait until ye're fully awake, 
      friend,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. &quot;And let me say, it's nice to 'ave ye back.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;No need to wait. Speak now. You have me curious. Remember too that you 
      just never know how long I'm going to be awake,&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> grinned. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> crouched down, sitting on his heels. His face was blank and cold. 
      His eyes turned to the ground as he drew in a breath to speak.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;See, this is 'ow it is. Well...um...when ye first came to us to find that 
      silly stone -- the Grozmok Stone -- we didn't know what to make of ye -- 
      ranting and crazy and all that,&quot; <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> spoke slowly, carefully searching 
      through his words. &quot;We agreed to 'elp ye, knowing we could. In fact, we 
      already 'ad.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> started picking blades of grass from the ground and rubbing them 
      between his fingers, avoiding <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> eyes.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Look at me <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a>. What are you saying?&quot; 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> asked, his face masked 
      with a cloud of disbelief. <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> lifted his eyes to
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a>.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We 'ave the Grozmok Stone. We got our 'ands on it long before we met. We 
      nicked it off them trolls at <a href="gulf.htm">Broken Skull Rock</a>,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said in a low 
      voice. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav's</a> mouth dropped and he clutched his heart as though he felt it 
      breaking apart. He looked to the shore, his glistening eyes pleading with 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> to indicate it wasn't true. Both 
      <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> and <a href="tondal.htm">Tondal</a> shamefully looked away from 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and turned to face the sea.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Don't blame 'em. I told 'em to keep their traps shut, friend,&quot; 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> said. &quot;If ye just give me ye're ear for a short spell, I'll tell ye 'ow we 
      'appened upon that stone and why I didn't tell ye sooner.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> was frozen with a mix of emotions, but managed to nod. 
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden</a> moved to sit cross-legged in front of 
      <a href="Calliav.htm">Calliav</a> and began recounting the 
      tale that brought the Grozmok Stone into <a href="nedaria.htm">Nedaria</a> and
      <a href="MordenRasp.htm">Morden's</a> hands.<br>
