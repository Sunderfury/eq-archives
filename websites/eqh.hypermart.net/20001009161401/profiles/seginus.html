<P><font size="2" color="gold" face="Arial"><b>Family history/heritage</b></font><br>
<font size="2" color="silver" face="Arial">From my studies at the great library of my home city, Erudin, I can safely say
that I am a true Erudite. My parent's were born here in Erudin, their parent's were born here in Erudin, and so on.
My family stretches all far back until the time when Erudites were part of the standard Human society. My early family
was part of the original group from Antonica, and some members of my family believe that one of my fathers had been a friend
of Erud and met Miragul himself. Only rumor, yes, but nothing to be ashamed of.</font>

<P><font size="2" color="gold" face="Arial"><b>Father</b></font><br>
<font size="2" color="silver" face="Arial">Sadly, I have never met my father. Nor do I really know who he was. It is fact
that his birth was right here in Erudin, but it is generally unknown about what kind of man he was. Unfortunately,
when I was younger than two years of age, my father was 'forced' to make a trip to the Human continent. He was in search
of a special artifact said to be hidden in a mountain range near Queynos, some say the Butcher Block mountains.
Others say Najena. In any case, there was great worry that others, perhaps a Human, had already found the artifact
or would soon. So, he was eager to be on his way. Why the artifact was not found earlier, I do not know. What it is
was, I do not know. Some say magical, others say simply a valuable jewel. A large gem. It is my personal belief
it was a magical artifact. He was reported killed by strange creatures and the artifact undiscovered by the return
ship. When my father and another man was killed, the crew immediately returned to Erudin. None have felt brave enough
to seek out the artifact since, and none know it's whereabouts.</font>

<P><font size="2" color="gold" face="Arial"><b>Mother</b></font><br>
<font size="2" color="silver" face="Arial">Recently, my mother has died of an unnown sickness. Also born in Erudin,
she was never the same after my father's death. She, like my father, enjoyed seeking out new and undiscovered things.
Mostly magical artifacts. Much of our lands is yet undiscovered, so therefore we seek to discover all there is to
discover. To learn all there is to learn. She died five years ago.</font>

<P><font size="2" color="gold" face="Arial"><b>Brothers/Sisters</b></font><br>
<font size="2" color="silver" face="Arial">My mother once said I had a brother, but he was captured by a band of
Dark Elf Necromancers on his first exploration of the outside world. I wish I knew more about him, but I do not.
I hope that my newfounded guild and I, in our quest for knowledge, can find him. I pray to Quellious that he has
not been turned into one of them.</font>

<P><font size="2" color="gold" face="Arial"><b>Myself</b></font><br>
<font size="2" color="silver" face="Arial">I am twenty-four years of age. I was but nineteen when my mother died.
It is not until now that I have decided to form a group, an organization, meant to seek out knowledge, power, information,
and undiscovered land. Land. The outside world. It will remain a portion of my goal to journey all of the world of
Norrath in my journeys. My master goal is to seek knowledge, my secondary to seek land, and my third to seek my brother.
Meanwhile, perhaps I will find this 'artifact' my father has lost. All the while I will be strict with Erudite cultures.
I will hate the outcasts and the terrible magic they practiced: Necromancy. Soon, I depart Erudin for my quest of
knowledge.</font>
