Levels</em></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Breath of the Dead<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 45 mana requiring 1 fish
scale</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Allows the Necromancer to breath underwater.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Ironically, now that I occasionally
    need fish scales, my fishing is so good that I usually get
    fish and only rarely get the scales.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Haunting Corpse<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 240 mana requiring 2 bone
chips</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Summons an undead skeleton to do the Necromancer's
    bidding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is the first pet whose bones have
    a reddish appearance, still soaked in blood. This is also the
    first pet that absolutely must be researched.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Intensify Dead<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 50 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Increases the combat abilities of the Necromancer's pet.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>As if your undead minion weren't
    terrifying enough, this spell makes it stronger, faster, and
    harder to hit. It takes a while to cast, so try to get it off
    just before the flailing begins. It seems to last for several
    minutes - long enough for one combat, but probably not two.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Leatherskin<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 83 mana requiring 1
bloodstone</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Absorbs damage before it can affect the Necromancer until
    its limit is reached.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The next in the Skin line of spells,
    and about twice as effective as Shieldskin. Like Shieldskin,
    I only use it on certain occasions since it's a bit expensive
    to keep constantly up.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Major Shielding<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 80 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Provides the Necromancer with increased maximum health, an
    armor class bonus, and increased Magic Resistance.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Much better than Shielding. Get it.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Rapacious Subversion</strong></font><font
size="3"><br>
being an Alteration of 200 mana</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Grants the target a fair amount of mana.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The target seems to get a bit less than
    a third of the mana that you spend. While I can come up with
    all kinds of hypothetical situations where this might be
    useful, none of them seem very likely. Necromantic testing
    continues.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Resist Cold<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 50 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Increases the target's Cold Resistance.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Quite a bit better than Endure Cold,
    and by now you're probably running into all sorts of things
    that can blast you with snow and frost.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Rest the Dead<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 75 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Makes the target undead less likely to attack.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is the upgrade to Numb the Dead.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Scent of Shadow</strong></font><font
size="3"><br>
being an Alteration of 100 mana</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Reduces the target's Disease Resistance,
    Poison Resistance, and Fire Resistance by a fair amount.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The second spell in the series,
    eventually about twice as effective as Scent of Dusk for
    twice the mana. Still expensive to cast, and I still haven't
    made up my mind about whether it's worth it.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Screaming Terror<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 60 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Paralyzes the target as they scream in abject terror,
    possibly inducing forgetfulness about any attackers.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Whacking them upside the head will stop
    the screaming, so leave them alone for the full effect.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shadow Sight<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 50 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Grants the Necromancer ultravision.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Ultravision is definitely better than
    infravision, so I almost always cast this around dusk. It
    lasts all night.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shock of Poison<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 100 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hits the target for a good amount of poison damage.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>WHAM! Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
    WHAM! Mua ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! WHAM!</em></font></p>
