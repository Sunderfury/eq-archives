Levels</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Blood Boil<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 150 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Damages the target and drains their health over time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>A welcome upgrade indeed, this does
    much more damage than Heat Blood.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dismiss Undead<br>
</strong></font>being an Evocation of 90 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hits the target undead for a good amount of damage,
    usually doing some damage even if resisted.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>It's about as effective as Shock of
    Poison, for only a little less mana. You'll be tempted to
    ignore it since it only works on the undead, but remember to
    keep that evocation skill up.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dooming Darkness<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 120 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Slows the target's movement and drains their health over
    time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Another very welcome and long overdue
    upgrade, doing significantly more damage than Engulfing
    Darkness. More importantly, it slows the target down a lot
    more - it's about equal to Snare.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Panic the Dead<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 125 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Causes the target undead to flee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Renew Bones<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 125 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Heals the pet of the Necromancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Spirit Tap<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 144 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a good amount of health from the target and grants
    it to the Necromancer.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>About twice as effective as Siphon
    Life, for about twice the mana. When you need it, nothing
    else will do.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Summon Dead<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 290 mana requiring 2 bone
chips</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Summons an undead skeleton to do the Necromancer's
    bidding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is the first pet that will wield
    two weapons. It needs weapons to do it though, so be sure to
    have some handy. I've seen the scroll for sale at an
    out-of-the-way vendor that had a number of hard-to-find
    spells. A troll or ogre should also be able to pick it up for
    you.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Vampiric Curse<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 148 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a good amount of health from the target over time
    and grants it to the Necromancer.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Ahhh, the upgrade to Leach. This will
    eventually drain significantly more life from your foe than
    Spirit Tap, and easily offsets Allure of Death. It also lets
    the Necromancer step into battle for a bit and not worry too
    much. An absolute must.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Word of Spirits<br>
</strong></font>being an Evocation of 150 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hits enemies in the vicinity of the Necromancer for a fair
    amount of damage.</p>
</blockquote>
