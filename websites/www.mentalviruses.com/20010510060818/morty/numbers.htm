<p><em>All gnomes, by their very nature, would make skilled
Necromancers if only they would embrace the path of Bertoxxulous.
As it currently stands, though, only a select few follow the
Plaguebringer. The rest are therefore doomed to be our eternal
slaves in undeath - which works out pretty well for us
Necromancers, so I'm not complaining.</em></p>

<p>The seven personal characteristics play a large part in
determining anyone's success, progress, and longevity, and gnomes
are no exception. Gnome Necromancers are particularly gifted in
their two primary characteristics, Intelligence and Dexterity,
giving them a distinct advantage over the not-so-quick dark elves
and erudites, and the not-so-bright humans.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Strength</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Strength determines carrying ability and the power of
    melee hits. Gnomes, being small and weak, are relatively
    limited in these areas. Thankfully, the Necromancer does not
    rely on heavy armor, so this hardly matters. Even low level
    Necromancers can siphon the strength of their enemies to make
    themselves stronger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Stamina</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Stamina influences how long strenuous tasks (like
    swimming, jumping, and melee) can be performed before tiring,
    as well as maximum health at any given level. While more
    health is always nice, most Necromancers spend quite a lot of
    time draining the health out of others, easily making up for
    any gnomish deficiency in this area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Agility</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Agility indicates the ability to avoid being hit in melee,
    and is defensive in nature. Gnomes are naturally agile, which
    benefits the Necromancer since they will be spending their
    fair share of time in melee, at least to begin with. At
    higher levels agility is much less important, since being a
    melee target for a powerful beastie is asking for certain
    doom regardless of how nimble you are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dexterity</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Dexterity affects the chances of triggering special weapon
    abilities and Vampiric Embrace, and might have something to
    do with archery. Given that the Necromancer will be knee-deep
    in melee at lower levels and still occasionally trying to get
    a shot in at higher levels (while not becoming a target!),
    this may be important. Inherent gnomish dexterity is good,
    and basic gnome Necromancer dexterity is better. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Wisdom</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Wisdom reflects the chances of recovering from a failure
    (such as when using trade skills), and resistance to some
    spells affecting the mind. These things are not completely
    unimportant to the Necromancer's well being, but gnomes are
    notoriously weak in this area. Boosting wisdom a bit isn't
    unreasonable, but is certainly not necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Intelligence</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Intelligence determines the ability to increase skills
    through use. For the Necromancer, it is also the cornerstone
    of power, for it sets the amount of mana available,
    influences the chance of a spell fizzling, and determines how
    effective the Specialization skills will be. Most if not all
    gnome Necromancers have extremely enhanced intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Charisma</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Charisma dictates the prices offered by merchants, helps
    offset the negative effects of annoying certain groups, and
    also influences the degree of success for a few spells of the
    dominating variety. Gnomes learn early that merchants will
    overcharge them any chance that they get, and just get used
    to it. Gnome Necromancers in particular are not out to win
    popularity contests; in fact, powerful Necromancers often end
    up reducing their charisma as the commoners view them with
    greater and greater dread. Charisma is for high elf wimps who
    couldn't strike terror into the heart of a halfling child
    even if they ripped out their own brains and set them on
    fire.</p>
