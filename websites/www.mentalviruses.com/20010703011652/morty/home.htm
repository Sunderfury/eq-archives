<h4><i>&quot;I have heard your pleas.  I accept your offering.<br>
I have noted your sacrifice and not forgotten.<br>
I shall grant your plea and show you my blessing.<br>
I shall send a threefold plague. I shall bless the animals, people, and plants.<br>
The animals shall froth and know my joy.<br>
The plants will know the full cycle of life.  They shall not know sickle or scythe.<br>
The very air will reverberate with my presence.<br>
All shall know that I am the Plague Bringer.&quot;</i></h4>

<p>Welcome!  I'm in the process of seriously reworking the entire
NecroGnomicon, which is why quite a lot of things are out of date.
The <a href="disclaim.htm" target="Ground">disclaimer and warning</a>
still holds true, but expect to see some very dramatic changes in
the near future.</p>
<p>As part of the redesign, I've set up a <a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon"
title="Words of Darkness" target="_top">message board</a> to help keep track of things.
Please give it a visit!</p>

<h2>News for June 15, 2001</h2>

<p>Due to circumstances beyond my control (hint: it has to do with making money), I wasn't
able to complete the new version of the NecroGnomicon in time for the Fan Faire.  Such is
life, such is death.  Perhaps next week...</p>
<p>The <a href="research.html" target="Ground">Research Trivials Chart</a> is still being
updated.  It will be incorporated into the new version with a nicer look.</p>
