the Dark Arts<br>
</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>for Necromancers of 1
Level</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Cavorting Bones<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 15 mana requiring 1 bone
chip</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Summons an undead skeleton to do the Necromancer's
    bidding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The first in a long series of spells
    raising the dead to do your bidding. This is the defining art
    of the Necromancer, and wise use of the skeletal pet cannot
    be overemphasized.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Coldlight<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 15 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Summons a Coldstone to provide light.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Yes, you've got good night vision. Yes,
    you'll have a much better light source soon. You could live
    without this spell... but sooner or later, you'll be running
    through a dark tunnel trying to retrieve your well-lit body,
    and you'll be happier if you can plunk one of these things
    out of the air. Trust me.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Disease Cloud<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 10 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Afflicts the target with disease, doing a small amount of
    damage over a period of time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The initial damage is inconsequential;
    the lingering damage will negate the regenerative abilities
    of most creatures for several levels. Disease is your friend.
    Praise Bertoxxulous!</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Invisibility versus Undead<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 40 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Renders the target invisible to most undead.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Note the word &quot;most.&quot; Some
    powerful undead aren't fooled. Your pet will always be
    fooled, however, and will promptly turn to dust. Be aware
    that this spell tends to blink out, without warning, after an
    unpredictable period of time - typically when you need it
    most.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Lifetap<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 9 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a small amount of health from the target and grants
    it to the Necromancer.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is the first in the series of
    &quot;drain you and heal me&quot; spells. A nice addition to
    combat, but too expensive to be the only form of attack. When
    you're poisoned or diseased, though, this spell and its kin
    can save your hide. The world is your snack bar.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Locate Corpse<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 5 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Points the Necromancer towards the nearest corpse. If a
    target is selected, this will point the Necromancer towards
    the nearest corpse of the target.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>If a Necromancer needs help finding
    their own corpse, it's a professional disgrace. Get this one
    early. This is also one of the few spells that other people
    occasionally need, so here's your chance to make a useful
    contribution to society (if you're into that sort of thing)
    or mock the dead (which is much more entertaining: &quot;Hey,
    this is still fresh. Are you gonna eat this?&quot;).</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Minor Shielding<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 10 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Provides the Necromancer with increased maximum health and
    an armor class bonus.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Here's the first of another line of
    spells. Unless you're feeling completely safe (and I know
    that I never do) you'll want to keep your best shielding
    spell up at all times.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Reclaim Energy<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 5 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Destroys the Necromancer's summoned pet and returns a
    portion of the mana used to summon it.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The pet needs to be your target and
    within the range of the spell. It's easier and faster just to
    tell your pet to get lost, but if your pet isn't responding
    to commands for some reason, this can be handy. At lower
    levels you probably won't notice the amount of mana you get
    back; at level 16, I got half a bubble, which could be
    worthwhile.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Sense the Dead<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 5 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Points the Necromancer towards the nearest undead being,
    not including the Necromancer's pet.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Even though it ignores your own pet, it
    will find the pets of other Necromancers, so if there are a
    lot of your dark brethren around don't expect this to be very
    helpful. Aside from that, it's a handy thing that any
    Necromancer should be able to do. Useful when you're on the
    hunt for bone chips.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Siphon Strength<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 5 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a small amount of strength from the target and
    grants it to the Necromancer.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Anything that makes the enemy weaker
    and you stronger is a good thing. You may or may not notice
    any difference in the target's combat ability, but the
    personal strength boost is nice. Rumor has it that repeated
    castings will continue to drain the target's strength, but I
    haven't verified that.</em></font></p>
