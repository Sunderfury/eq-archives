<p><em>Understanding the interplay between the various factions
in Norrath is arguably more important for the Necromancer than
for any other class. Many groups will attack Necromancers on
sight in a foolish attempt to save themselves from their eventual
fate as our loyal servants, and members of those groups are not
always obvious. On the other hand, there are groups that look
favorably on the necromantic cause, and maintaining good
relations with those groups is highly recommended.</em></p>

<p><em>A quick comparison between these two lists will provide
some insight as to why the path of the gnome necromancer is
considered highly difficult.</em></p>

<p><em>Only two factions are completely supportive of the gnome
Necromancer. They are, not surprisingly, the secretive followers
of Bertoxxulous.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>The Dark Reflection</strong></font><br>
Ak'Anon</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>All of the Plaguebringer's minions among the gnomes gather
    together to form the Dark Reflection. This includes all gnome
    Necromancers, those clerics who follow the sinister path, and
    a handful of other believers. The Dark Reflection is our home
    and the primary source for our training. The guild hall in
    the Mines of Malfunction is also the only place in Faydwer to
    buy necromantic spells and robes that fit. Getting on the bad
    side of the Dark Reflection would be extremely unwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bloodsabers</strong></font><br>
Qeynos</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Shrine of Bertoxxulous is maintained by the
    Bloodsabers, and it is a wonder to behold. Every gnome
    Necromancer should make the pilgrimage to this concentration
    of grim power. The Bloodsabers themselves are doing an
    admirable job of infiltrating the ranks of the powerful in
    Qeynos. An adventurous gnome can do much to advance their
    cause.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>Despite the secrecy which the faithful of Bertoxxulous
tend to embrace, quite a few groups in Norrath are not only aware
of our existence, but dedicated to our extermination. The young
Necromancer is advised to avoid contact with these groups; the
advanced Necromancer is advised to eliminate them.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Emerald Warriors<br>
</strong></font>Kelethin, Greater Faydark</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The members of the wood elf warriors guild are not your
    friends. Unfortunately, this includes the guards who patrol
    Greater Faydark, occasionally wandering right by the
    entrances to both Lesser Faydark and the Butcherblock
    Mountains. This makes travel through Greater Faydark tense
    even at the best of times. They're also wandering around the
    tree city of Kelethin, but what would you be going there for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Faydark's Champions<br>
</strong></font>Kelethin, Greater Faydark, Lesser Faydark</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Champions are the wood elf rangers, and they're not
    your friends either. For the most part, this won't have much
    effect on your life, unless you have to attend a social
    function in Felwithe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Stormguard<br>
</strong></font>Kaladim, Butcherblock Mountains</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The dwarven warriors and guards don't like you either.
    This is a minor inconvenience, since travel through
    Butcherblock inevitably takes you past one or more guard
    posts. You shouldn't have any problems, though, if you give
    the guard posts a wide berth and stay out of Kaladim (a
    pitiful attempt to copy the glory of Ak'Anon).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Guardians of the Vale<br>
</strong></font>Rivervale, Misty Thicket</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Halflings warriors. Pfah. They seem to know instinctively
    that someday you'll be serving them in a light sauce with a
    side of greens, so they'll attack you given a chance. If you
    happen to be in Misty Thicket, watch out for them sneaking
    around - until you're ready to wipe them out. Just avoid
    Rivervale unless you're looking for something to spit on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Highpass Guards<br>
</strong></font>Highhold Keep, Highpass Hold</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most of the groups that despise Necromancers I don't
    really care about; they're weak and dull, and will eventually
    be our pets. The Highpass Guards, though, are different. Not
    only are they respectable warriors, but they've shown a
    superb grasp of strategy by establishing complete control
    over a rather critical piece of real estate. If you're
    traveling between Freeport and Qeynos, you only have three
    paths to choose from: the long southern route through
    Innothule and the Rathe Moutains; the annoying northern route
    through Rivervale and RunnyEye; or the direct route through
    Highpass. Unless you've made friends with the Highpass
    Guards, the direct route will give you nightmares for weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>JaggedPine Treefolk<br>
</strong></font>Surefall Glade, Qeynos Hills, Qeynos</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Druids are food, and the Treefolk are no exception. They
    seem to resist this notion, but there it is. Kill them before
    they try to defend themselves - which they will, so be
    careful until you're ready. If you stay out of Surefall Glade
    (until you're ready to make it your own personal cooking
    pit), the only problems you should have are Holly and Cros in
    the Qeynos Hills and the occasional wandering druid in
    Qeynos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>The Wolves of the North<br>
</strong></font>Halas, Everfrost</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Would you believe that the barbarian warriors want you
    dead too? Yup. By the time I found that out it wasn't that
    difficult to avoid them, since the big-boned louts are about
    as far from Ak'Anon as possible - which is good, considering
    the smell. I'm sure there might be a reason to get on their
    good side, but I can't think of what it would be offhand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Da Bashers<br>
</strong></font>Grobb, Innothule Swamp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The troll warriors are surprisingly unfriendly. I can't
    imagine why. Luckily, there's nothing of value in Grobb, and
    the only place you'll find an occasional troll guard is in
    Innothule Swamp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Ogre Guard<br>
</strong></font>Oggok, Feerrott</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another surprise, the ogre guards don't look kindly to
    gnome Necromancers. Again, I'm not sure what's behind this,
    since other ogres don't seem to have an issue with us.
    Unfriendly ogre bouncers are a bit more of a hazard than
    their trollish counterparts since they wander around
    Feerrott, which you'll likely need to pass through if you
    find yourself in the southern parts of Antonica. By the time
    you find yourself doing that, though, you should have a
    number of ways to keep yourself safe.</p>
