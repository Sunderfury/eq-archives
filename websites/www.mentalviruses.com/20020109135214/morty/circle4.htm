Levels</em></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bind Affinity<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 100 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sets the target's return point of gating or death to their
    current position.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>You can bind yourself anywhere - I
    would recommend not binding yourself too close to the guards,
    if you know what I mean. You can also bind other members of
    your group, but only near cities. This spell is a must.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Convoke Shadow<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 120 mana requiring 2 bone
chips</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Summons an undead skeleton to do the Necromancer's
    bidding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is the first pet that hits for
    magical damage, so you can now go after wisps and ghouls.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Endure Disease<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 20 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Increases the target's Disease Resistance.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Another one of the few buffing spells
    that you can share with your comrades.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Engulfing Darkness<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 60 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Slows the target's movement and drains their health over
    time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The next in the Darkness line - a
    little slower, and a little more damage.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Heat Blood<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 72 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Damages the target and drains their health over time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The first of the Blood line of spells,
    which go up against the target's Fire Resistance to determine
    success - so don't expect it to be useful in Lavastorm, for
    example. Aside from that, the Darkness, Poison, and Blood
    spells combine nicely, even though your poison spell is no
    longer very effective at this point. Heat Blood will be
    useful for quite a while.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Leach<br>
</strong></font><font size="3">being an Alteration of 72 mana</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Drains a good amount of health from the
    target over time and grants it to the Necromancer.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This drains approximately twice as much
    health from the target as Lifedraw, which is quite a deal if
    you're willing to wait for the full effect.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Lifedraw<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 63 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a fair amount of health from the target and grants
    it to the Necromancer.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>About four times as effective as
    Lifespike.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Scent of Dusk</strong></font><font
size="3"><br>
being an Alteration of 50 mana</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Reduces the target's Disease Resistance,
    Poison Resistance, and Fire Resistance by a small amount.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is the first spell in the Scent
    series, which lowers the main resistances that a Necromancer
    cares about. I still haven't made up my mind if the high mana
    cost is worth it, but I'm sure there are situations where
    it's useful. Necromantic testing continues.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Sight Graft<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 10 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Allows the Necromancer to see through the eyes of their
    pet.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>About the only use I can think of for
    this is if you want to watch for the appearance of something,
    but don't actually want to be around when it happens. It's
    also interesting to get the skeleton-eye view of combat, just
    to see what it's like.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Spook the Dead<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 10 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Causes the target undead to flee.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Cheap for a 12th level spell, no sense
    not getting it. Uses a quarter of the mana that Fear does,
    and functionally equivalent. No Necromancer should be without
    the special &quot;dealing with the dead&quot; spells.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Wave of Enfeeblement<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 40 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a fair amount of strength from enemies in the
    vicinity of the Necromancer.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is a great way to get the
    attention of a large crowd, if that's what you're looking
    for. Also known as &quot;Wave of My Pet Kills Me&quot; if
    you're PvP.</em></font></p>
