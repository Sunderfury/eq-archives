<p><em>Not far from Qeynos there lies a fishing paradise,
sequestered in a series of caverns. Underground springs feed
pools and streams that quickly collect into a single deep lake.
The water is clear and cold, there's plenty of shoreline, and the
fish are always biting.</em></p>

<p><em>The gnolls are always biting too, but that's just part of
the charm.</em></p>

<p>All in all, it was a wonderful time. A catch of 17 fish, and a
new friend in western Antonica. I must remember to look him up
next time I'm passing through.</p>

<p>Where to next? I hear there's a lake in Surefall Glade. Seems
like the perfect place for some fishing and hunting.</p>

<p>&quot;No gnomes were harmed during the making of this fishing
trip. Lots of other things died, but no gnomes were harmed.&quot;</p>
