<p align="right"><font size="5"><em><strong>Dead Pet Tricks<br>
</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>Commanding the Walking
Dead</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>The most obvious facet of Necromancy, and one of the most
useful, is commanding the actions of the walking dead. The
Necromancer's bony &quot;pet&quot; is both loyal and fierce, but
is only as powerful as the mind controlling it. Know your pet
commands as well as your own name if you wish to follow the dark
path to power.</em></p>

<p><em>These commands are also effective on those undead
creatures which you dominate for a short time.</em></p>

<p><em>It is important to realize that your undead servant will
only sense your commands from a short distance away. Get to know
this distance, for any commands that you issue when your pet is
farther away go unheeded.</em></p>

<p><em>There are seven commands that I always keep at my
fingertips. These are the most important - master their use and
the remaining commands are largely optional.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Attack</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When this command is issued, your bony slave will rush off
    and attempt to destroy the pitiful creature that is your
    target. Remember that the skeleton, being without eyes,
    cannot sense enemies from a great distance and will only
    attack when the enemy is within range. &quot;Kill&quot; works
    in a similar manner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Back Off</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This command will stop your slave from attacking, and it
    will return to a more passive state. If it is hit again,
    however, it will once more join in battle, so plan
    accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Follow Me</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is the state in which your undead thrall arrives. It
    will follow you to the best of its ability, and will attempt
    to destroy anything that strikes you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Guard Here</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As soon as your pet hears this command, it will stay in
    one place until attacked or given some other command. If the
    pet is sent to attack, it will return to its designated spot
    when the attack is completed (either through the foe's death,
    or from the Back Off command). Terribly, terribly useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Report Health</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This simple command will let you know how intact your
    skeleton friend is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Taunt</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When your undead companion first arrives, it will
    naturally attempt to taunt attackers from you. Issuing this
    command will cease the taunting. Issuing this command again
    will resume the taunting. There are uses for both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Sit Down</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This command will transform your threatening minion of
    death into an innocent-looking pile of bones. The bones seem
    to knit together faster when collapsed like this. Naturally,
    your pet is still ready to follow or guard as you desire.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>These commands are also useful at times, but I don't find
myself needing them all that much.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Target</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is not precisely a command to the pet, but makes the
    pet the Necromancer's target. There are easier ways of doing
    this, but it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Who Leader</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Just in case anyone's wondering, this command will remind
    everyone who's in charge of whom. This is mostly useful when
    you're in a situation where you're dominating the undead and
    people wonder why the ghoul isn't attacking anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Stand Up</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If your minion is collapsed into a pile of bones, this
    command brings them back up into a standing and ready
    position. It's good for effect. Since the pet will
    automatically stand up before following or attacking,
    however, I rarely use this command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Get Lost</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If your skeletal follower annoys you, simply command it to
    get lost and it will promptly turn to dust. This does not
    work on dominated undead that you have not personally
    summoned - that would be too easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>I don't like these commands, but for the sake of
completeness, here they are.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Guard Me</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When this command is issued, your skeletal pet will follow
    you around (much like Follow Me). It will also take it upon
    itself to attack the occasional bypasser without your
    specific instruction. I don't believe the dead deserve this
    much freedom, so I always use Follow Me instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>As You Were</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This command clears the mind of your pet, causing it to
    forget all of your previous commands. This will cause your
    summoned pet to stand around mindlessly, only reacting to
    attacks on your person. Clearing the mind of a dominated
    undead will cause it to resume whatever wanderings it was
    pursuing - until the domination breaks, at which point it
    will come back seeking your fresh blood. It could be useful
    if you've issued an Attack command and let your enemy get
    away... but if you've done that, you pretty much deserve to
    die a horrible death in any case, so deal with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>&quot;All I demand is that the dead do my bidding. Is that too
much to ask?&quot;</p>
