<p><em>Tinkering being the mysterious thing that it is, legends
have naturally grown concerning what could be built, if only we
knew how. I've listed a few of those things here for general
amusement.</em></p>

<p><em>By all the gods, if you run across one of these things
anywhere in Norrath, or stumble upon the secret to creating one, </em><a

Gnomes everywhere will sing your praises.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Infravision Goggles</strong></font><br>
Legendary</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is probably the most popular of the legendary items,
    as it would have charges granting the wearer infravision.
    Quite a few people - well, quite a few humans anyway - would
    dearly love to have one of these little contraptions and
    would pay a handsome price for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gnomish Clockworks I, IV, and XI</strong></font><br>
Legendary</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Rumors about clockwork pets have been around for a long,
    long time. No one has ever seen a tinkered pet, and Those Who
    Should Know have said that it will never happen. Too bad. The
    idea of a clockwork rat pet amuses me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Jet Pack<br>
</strong></font>Legendary</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This unlikely contraption would, according to legend,
    allow the wearer to float freely in the air. Pretty unlikely,
    if you ask me, since some of our tinkered items can get
    pretty heavy. It would presumably be black.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gnomish Tinkered Pistol<br>
</strong></font>Legendary</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I've seen a picture, but I don't believe it. Still... one
    can dream. Rumor makes it a range weapon with 2 shots for
    some pretty hefty damage.</p>
