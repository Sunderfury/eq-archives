<p>On the whole, Necromancers are not terribly popular. Part of
this lack of popularity is attributable to jealousy, as mere
mortals stand in awe of our incredible power. Another factor to
consider is rebellion, since most of the people we meet will
eventually become our playthings. Whatever the motivations of the
foolish, however, it is important for the Necromancer to have a
clear idea of who may be considered a friend, and who may be
struck down without a second thought.</p>

<p>Occasionally, someone will get on my bad side. This is fairly
difficult to do. I'm a patient sort, and my wrath is usually
tempered by the knowledge that I will eventually be torturing the
remains of those petty mortals throughout an eternity of undying.
When the line is crossed, though, vengeance becomes something of
a personal hobby and I revel in my communion with the
Plaguebringer.</p>
