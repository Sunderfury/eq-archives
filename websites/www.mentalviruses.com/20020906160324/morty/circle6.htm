Levels</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Allure of Death<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 5 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains the Necromancer's health over time and increases
    mana regeneration.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>About twice as effective as Dark Pact,
    and quite the time saver. Also known as &quot;Spook the
    Cleric&quot; - be aware that it can cause some panic in your
    group members if they don't know what's going on.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Animate Dead<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 200 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Summons an undead skeleton to do the Necromancer's
    bidding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>I had to have an ogre get this for me.
    How embarrassing.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dominate Undead<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 120 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Charms the target undead to do the Necromancer's bidding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>When it works, it's really nice -
    having a ghoul for a pet is a pleasant change. When it fails,
    though, it's expensive and hazardous. Terribly handy in the
    right group situation, but more than a little risky when
    you're alone in the dark. More charisma would probably be
    helpful, but who cares?</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Expulse Undead<br>
</strong></font>being an Evocation of 60 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hits the target undead for a good amount of damage,
    usually doing some damage even if resisted.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>A little more than twice as good as
    Ward Undead, for twice the mana. You have been keeping your
    Evocation skill up, haven't you?</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Harmshield<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 85 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Makes the Necromancer invulnerable for a brief amount of
    time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Amazing, simply amazing. It seems to
    give about 30 seconds of absolutely no damage from anything,
    but </em></font><a href="harmtest.htm" target="Ground"><font
    size="2"><em>necromantic testing continues</em></font></a><font
    size="2"><em>. The long recast time means you'll only get it
    off once in any dire situation, but a suitably motivated
    gnome can cover a lot of ground in that 30 seconds. You can
    still be stunned, so don't get cocky. Depending on where I
    am, I always have either this or Feign Death memorized.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Identify<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 50 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Reveals an item's lore.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The only items this has been at all
    useful for have been key parts of specific quests, and even
    then the information revealed is only a small hint. I imagine
    it might come in handy for some very obscure things one might
    not know what to do with. It will also identify what language
    a book or note is written in.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shadow Compact</strong></font><font
size="3"><br>
being an Alteration of 10 mana</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a good amount of health from the Necromancer over a
    short time and grants it to the target.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><em>It's about the equivalent of hitting
    someone with Siphon Life, only slowly and in reverse. It has
    all sorts of uses - pets, poisoned comrades, whoever is in
    front taking hits - and uses almost no mana. Quite the good
    thing.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shadow Vortex<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 40 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains strength from the target's armor, and grants it to
    the Necromancer's armor.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is a good lead spell if you're in
    a group with a number of melee types, as it should make all
    of their attacks much more effective. And a little more
    protection is always a good thing.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Siphon Life<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 72 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a good amount of health from the target and grants
    it to the Necromancer.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>About one-and-a-half times as effective
    as Lifedraw, and for only a little more mana. A welcome
    upgrade indeed.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Word of Shadow<br>
</strong></font>being an Evocation of 85 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hits enemies in the vicinity of the Necromancer for a fair
    amount of damage.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>You probably don't want to use this
    spell unless you've got at least three enemies packed tightly
    together, since it doesn't do all that much damage for the
    amount of mana that it requires - and if you've got that many
    enemies right on top of you, you might have other problems.
    It does count as Evocation practice, though, and it's a nice
    effect.</em></font></p>
