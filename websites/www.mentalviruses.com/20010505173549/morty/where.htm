to their children.</p>

<p>They tell of the strong goblin miners, and how one day those
who went too deep in the mine never came back.</p>

<p>They tell of the wise goblin soothsayers who went to
investigate this strange matter, and who also vanished without a
trace.</p>

<p>They tell of the powerful goblin warlords who went in
arrogance to the depths of the mines, and who have yet to return.</p>

<p>They tell of the dark silence where there was once the sound
of hammers and picks - a silence broken only by a faint, maniacal
cackling.</p>

<p>Late at night, the goblins tell a tale to their children.</p>

<p>A tale about me.</p>
