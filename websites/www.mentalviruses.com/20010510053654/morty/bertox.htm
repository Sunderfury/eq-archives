following the Plaguebringer</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>The gnome Necromancer is a servant of Bertoxxulous - there
can be no other. This is well and good, but the wise Necromancer
understands that there is a different between being the
Plaguebringer's servant and being his victim.</em></p>

<p>Little has been written concerning Bertoxxulous and those who
follow him. The oft-quoted description goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Followers of Bertoxxulous believe the only truth on
    Norrath is that everything dies. They view the decay of flesh
    as a thing of ultimate beauty. The subtle purples of a fresh
    bruise, the almost irridescent yellow green of an infested
    pustule, are but a few of the things that His followers
    relish. It is not suprising that many of His followers pursue
    the dark art of Necromancy, for to them nothing is more
    desirable than to be surrounded by beings who, even in
    unlife, continue to rot and decay. Do not take this to mean
    that His followers are suicidal or seek a quick death. To the
    contrary, they wish to live long, painful lives, spreading
    their dark, diseased stain across all of Norrath.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, this is true as far as it goes. The deeper truth is that
the decay and disease that are the hallmarks of the Plaguebringer
are, in truth, merely stripping away that which is weak - namely,
the flesh. The power of necromancy is the power of the spirit
that is beyond death, to which power the frail blossom of life is
but a passing moment.</p>

<p>Decay and disease are our tools, and we should certainly use
those tools to bring about death and the transcendence which
follows. We would be wise not to lose sight of the true goal by
focusing on the implements which we use to attain it.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Necromancer should not hesitate to embrace
death should the situation call for it. While an untimely demise
can be a setback, we know that it is but a short-lived
transition, and by no means permanent for ones such as ourselves.
Know death well, the better to command it in others.</p>

<p>&quot;All things die. This is the Truth of Bertoxxulous.&quot;</p>
