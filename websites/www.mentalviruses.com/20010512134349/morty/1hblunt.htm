<p><em>For the Necromancer, the only usable one-handed blunt
weapon is the staff. In theory, that's not so bad since there are
a number of interesting staves that the Necromancer can use, and
there are also several items that can be held in the other hand
to make a one-handed weapon worth considering. A good staff deals
out about the same damage as a good dagger in any given combat,
and the greater delay may mean fewer spell interruptions due to
your own attacks. On the down side, finding a magical staff can
be a chore.</em></p>

<p><em>The mundane staff is, of course, far more common than the
more interesting variations.</em></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Probably your first one-handed blunt weapon, found on
    monsters all over Norrath. Get one early and use it regularly
    if you plan on using one of the magical ones later.</p>
</blockquote>

    <p>The basic staff. I've never seen one used, to be honest.</p>

<p><em>Magical staves are better, harder to find, and more
expensive, but it's usually worth the trouble.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Fire</strong></font><br>
5 damage, 25 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It burns. Specifically, it will sometimes hit a melee
    target with a Burst of Fire. It also grants the wielder a
    boon of +5 fire resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Orb of Tishan</strong></font><br>
7 damage, 25 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Someone powerful put a lot of energy into this thing. The
    entrapped forces grant the wielder a boon of +9 strength, +9
    stamina, and +35 mana. As if that weren't enough, the poor
    fool you're attacking can also be hit with Tashania, lowering
    their magic resistance. It also looks much better than a
    plain stick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Writhing<br>
</strong></font>9 damage, 33 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Evil on a stick. In addition to dealing out a fair amount
    of melee damage, this will also occasionally fire off Chaotic
    Feedback for extra brain-frying power. The skull on the end
    of the staff scares people, though, so the wielder suffers a
    penalty of -9 charisma. Ha! Let them cower in fear. This is
    the staff of choice for the discriminating Necromancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Crystal staves are similar to the basic staff and throw in
a magical punch for good measure. They also look more interesting
than your garden-variety staff, which adds something to their
desirability.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Fire Crystal Staff</strong></font><br>
5 damage, 28 delay, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>During melee, this staff will sometimes hit the target
    with Shock of Fire. Never turn down the chance to burn your
    enemies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Ice Crystal Staff</strong></font><br>
5 damage, 28 delay, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Every now and then, this staff will cast Shock of Frost on
    the melee target. Since most folks don't expect a Necromancer
    to be handing out damage from cold, the surprise value alone
    makes it worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Slime Crystal Staff<br>
</strong></font>5 damage, 28 delay, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This staff will occasionally cast Sicken on the melee
    target. Bertoxxulous would be proud. Just because of that, I
    rank this as the second-best Necromancer weapon in this
    category.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Water Crystal Staff<br>
</strong></font>5 damage, 28 delay, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>During melee, this staff will sometimes hit the target
    with Shallow Breath, lowering their strength and agility and
    doing damage over time. Nice, but... really, it sounds like
    the kind of weapon some weak-willed bright-eyed high elf
    flower child would use. Definitely not the first choice for
    any self-respecting minion of death, but it will do in a
    pinch.</p>
