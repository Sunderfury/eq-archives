</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>for Necromancers of 8
Levels</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bone Walk<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 80 mana requiring 2 bone
chips</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Summons an undead skeleton to do the Necromancer's
    bidding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This one bashes, and I swear I saw one
    parry once.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dark Empathy<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 20 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a small amount of health from the Necromancer and
    grants it to the target.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Lifetap in reverse. This allows you to
    heal a comrade in an emergency situation. Used in conjunction
    with Mend Bones, you can keep your pet in good fighting
    condition during melee.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dark Pact<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 5 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains the Necromancer's health over time and increases
    mana regeneration.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>I tend to use this when I'm travelling.
    It's also useful when you're in a group with enough warrior
    types so you won't be involved in melee. As you progress in
    power, you tend to use it more and more as mana becomes more
    valuable than health.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Deadeye<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 35 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Grants the Necromancer infravision and the ability to see
    things that are otherwise invisible.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The infravision portion of the spell
    doesn't do much for a gnome.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gather Shadows<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 35 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Grants the Necromancer invisibility for a variable period
    of time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Like the common Invisibility spell,
    this spell tends to expire when you need it most, although
    you'll usually get a warning just before you appear. I once
    thought that this spell also granted some invisibility to
    undead, but I must have been mistaken. Remember there are
    things that can see the invisible. I fondly remember this as
    the &quot;Escape from Steamfont&quot; spell.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Impart Strength<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 15 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a small amount of strength from the Necromancer and
    grants it to the target.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Your comrades will appreciate the extra
    strength, and you can replenish what you've lost with Siphon
    Strength. But if someone else can boost strength, let them.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Lesser Shielding<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 25 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Provides the Necromancer with increased maximum health, an
    armor class bonus, and increased Magic Resistance.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>A distinct improvement over Minor
    Shielding. The catch here is that your local Necromancer
    guild might not carry all of the Shielding spells, and you'll
    need to find the appropriate spell merchant at the local
    Magician's guild if they'll sell to you. But it's worth the
    trouble.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Mend Bones<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 25 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Heals the pet of the Necromancer.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>I use this to keep my pet going in
    combat if I'm not in there mixing it up myself. This lets me
    avoid dealing with things that are poisonous. The amount of
    healing seems to progress with your casting power, as it's
    still quite effective on higher level pets.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shadow Step<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 10 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Teleports the Necromancer a short distance in a random
    direction.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>When I first picked up this spell, I
    tried it outside of the gates of Qeynos. I teleported maybe 5
    feet, repeatedly. I was not impressed, and forgot about the
    spell for a while. Later (around level 16) I started toying
    with it again, this time in the Karanas, and it usually
    whisked me a fair distance off. This became one of my
    standard &quot;get me out of here&quot; spells, but I
    eventually came to prefer Feign Death. Still, it has uses.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Vampiric Embrace<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 30 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Grants the Necromancer the chance of stealing health from
    an enemy in melee attacks.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>I used to have a love/hate relationship
    with this spell. Since I like stepping into the combat and
    getting my hands dirty, the extra life-stealing burst is
    great. Problem is, when you first get this spell, it doesn't
    seem to happen very often and the effect doesn't last very
    long. At higher levels, though, it lasts for a while,
    triggers several times in a combat, and does more and more
    damage. I used Vampiric Embrace consistently in my high teens
    and twenties.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Ward Undead<br>
</strong></font>being an Evocation of 30 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hits the target undead for a fair amount of damage,
    usually doing some damage even if resisted.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The good news is that this strikes
    undead about four times harder than Life Spike - decaying
    skeletons go in one hit, standard skeletons in two or three -
    so this is your hardest-hitting spell at this level. The bad
    news is that this is your first Evocation spell (you won't
    get the next one until level 20) so your skill level is
    pathetic. Use this (or it's brethren) whenever you can to
    increase your skill. I use it when I'm on the never-ending
    quest for bone chips.</em></font></p>
