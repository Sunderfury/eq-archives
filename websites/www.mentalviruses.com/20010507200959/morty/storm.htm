<p align="right"><font size="5"><em><strong>Good Question<br>
</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>Why do I spend my time
with those do-gooders?</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Despite the seeming contradiction, I am a proud member of
the Stormseekers, a small and friendly guild filled with honorable
sorts of folks. When I eventually establish my Demesne of Death
across Norrath and fill the cities with the walking dead, I'll
probably keep these people alive for company.</em></p>

<p><em>The Stormseekers was formed around the belief of &quot;Aku Zoku
Zan&quot; - which roughly translates into &quot;See Evil, Kill Evil.&quot;
Makes you nervous, doesn't it?  The fact that they haven't attempted to
kill me yet gives me hope, but still leads to the question:
&quot;What are you doing with these people? Why would any
Necromancer want to join up with any group of unbelievers?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>The reasons are many, and my contributions (which
typically involve something dying) only make the benefits that
much greater.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Power</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There's something about a huge collection of people that
    appeals to the power-hungry madman in me, particularly when I
    might be able to persuade them towards some course of action.
    Being on familiar terms with a small standing army has its
    advantages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Protection</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If ever the point comes when I'm in need of something, I
    know that at any given time there are quite a few people who
    would be willing to offer assistance, all in the name of
    honor - which essentially means that should any of my evil
    schemes go awry, there are a number of &quot;respectable&quot;
	folks around to bail me out and clear my name. Call it a backup plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Logistics</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The sheer variety in the ranks of the Stormseekers allows
    me access to some things that are otherwise hard to acquire -
    supplies from Kelethin, food from Halas, spells from the
    local wizards guild, and so on. I have also, on occasion,
    been whisked off to distant places with the helpful
    assistance of a wizard or <em>&lt;shudder&gt;</em> druid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Trade</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Without going into a rant on the benefits of free trade -
    a favorite topic of gnomish discussion - I'll just say that
    my fellow guild members provide a good market for obscure
    items. Since there are relatively few Necromancers in the
    guild, I have a decent chance of getting a fair deal for
    those rare words of research. Guild tradesfolk charge
    reasonable prices. In return, I have a place to get rid of
    all of those worthless runes and armor pieces that I run
    across.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Education</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some people see the guild as a cooperative mix of races
    and religions, working together for widespread benefit.
    That's true as far as it goes, but I also see it as a venue
    in which to spread the dark word of Bertoxxulous. Conversion
    is a slow process, but since there is already acceptance of
    the practice of necromancy as a worthwhile career, there is a
    much greater likelihood that an enlightened few will take the
    next step and walk into the shadows of the Plaguebringer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Death</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When it comes right down to it, the members of the Stormseekers
    are highly skilled killers. They may not think of themselves as such,
	but I've seen enough of them in action to know. Put a few of us
	together and lots of things die, quickly, in rapid succession.
	And isn't that really what a Necromancer wants?</p>
