Levels</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Clinging Darkness<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 20 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Slows the target's movement and drains their health over
    time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The first of the Darkness line of
    spells, which go up against the target's Magic Resistance to
    determine success. I consider this a standard part of combat,
    even though it does seem to be resisted more than I might
    want.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Endure Cold<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 20 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Increases the target's Cold Resistance.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Useful when you get into a disagreement
    with a Wizard or Shaman, and one of the few buffing spells
    you can share with your friends.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Fear<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 40 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Causes the target to flee.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>They'll be back. They might bring
    friends with them. And the duration of the fear seems to be
    unpredictable. Still, this can make the difference if you
    suddenly find yourself with two enemies instead of one. When
    it becomes more affordable, Fear will be a standard part of
    your arsenal - I almost always have it memorized.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gate<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 70 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Teleports the Necromancer to the place of binding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>If you haven't done a Bind Affinity,
    this teleports you to your home point. This makes your life
    easier in all kinds of ways. Takes a long time to cast, but
    can make for a good escape spell if your pet can keep the
    enemies away from you. This is also the spell I cast when I
    suddenly don't have a pet, and I don't remember seeing it
    wander off - when it happens to you, you'll know. This is
    another spell you'll have to track down, since some
    Necromancer guilds don't seem to carry it.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Grim Aura<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 25 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Increases the Necromancer's attack skill.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>If you're in melee, have it on. If
    you're not, don't. Simple.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Leering Corpse<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 40 mana requiring 2 bone
chips</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Summons an undead skeleton to do the Necromancer's
    bidding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>These dead-raising spells summon a
    skeleton of approximately the same level as the Necromancer
    needs to be to cast the spell. Since a level 4 Necromancer
    can cast this spell, it tends to summon a level 4 skeleton.
    This trend continues through the line of summong spells, more
    or less - well, less, but that's later. You'll always want
    your best summoning spell available.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Lifespike<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 18 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drains a small amount of health from the target and grants
    it to the Necromancer.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The next spell in the Lifetap series,
    and about twice as effective as the original.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Numb the Dead<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 20 mana requiring 1 bone
chip</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Makes the target undead less likely to attack.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Cast this on one member of a group, and
    it won't notice when you begin to destroy it's companion
    right next to it. It doesn't last very long, so act quickly
    to pull away.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Poison Bolt<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 30 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Damages the target with poison and drains their health
    over time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The first of the Poison line of spells,
    which go up against the target's Poison Resistance to
    determine success. Another standard combat spell. Since
    poison resistance seems less common than magic resistance,
    you might have better luck with this than with the Darkness
    line.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>True North<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 5 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Points the Necromancer directly north.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Believe it or not, I've had people walk
    up to me and ask which way is north. I'm not kidding. In any
    case, if you're bored, you can cast it over and over to raise
    your Divination skill.</em></font></p>
