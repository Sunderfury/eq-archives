<p><strong>This is an EverQuest fan site.</strong> No one
official is involved.</p>

<p><strong>Any or all of this information may be wrong.</strong>
Although I do my best to keep the site contents updated, the
world of Norrath is constantly changing. I have not personally
verified all of the information here, particularly with regard to
spells that I can't cast yet. Also, despite what I tell my
friends, I do occasionally make mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Some pieces of information may be considered spoilers.</strong>
By &quot;spoilers&quot; I mean any information that you could
find out in the course of play. This includes all of the
information regarding equipment, all of the research information,
and a number of other things. If you don't want to know, don't
look. The process of exploration and discovery is a wonderful
thing - tamper with it at your own discretion.</p>

<p><strong>I do not condone nonconsensual necromancy.</strong>
Respect the dead, and the dead will respect you.</p>
