</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>The traditional garb of
the magically inclined</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>More than anything else, the robe is what makes it clear
to the world that you are versed in the arcane arts and are not
to be trifled with. It also marks you as a prime target for your
enemies, but that's the way it goes. Robes are the best body
armor you've got, and also are the most important factor
determining how you look.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dark Gold Felt Robe</strong></font><br>
AC 2, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is the robe that you get when you turn in your note
    to the guildmaster. It will be your armor for far too long,
    unless you skip the robe look and go with some variety of
    shirt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dark Gold Jr. Apprentice Robe</strong></font><br>
AC 3, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The improved version of your first robe, this provides
    better armor and gives you the minor perk of +1 mana. Since
    no city outside of Ak'Anon sells robes that will fit a gnome,
    and since the gold gnome robes can't be worn by a
    Necromancer, you don't have many options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dark Gold Sr. Apprentice Robe</strong></font><br>
AC 4, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The best of the apprentice robes, with the minor perk of
    +2 mana. This robe is distinctly darker than the initial felt
    robe, much closer to brown than gold. It's a good, earthy
    look.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Thaumaturgist's Robe</strong></font><br>
AC 5, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This rather heavy robe provides a fair amount of
    protection, and also grants the wearer a boost of +3 agility.
    Considering the nature of its original owner, it's really
    quite fitting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Silk Robe<br>
</strong></font>AC 6</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A tailor with a little skill can craft this comfortable
    robe. It provides no particular bonuses, and is not magical,
    but it's a lot easier to come by.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Damask Robe</strong></font><br>
AC 6, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A quite functional robe with an off-white appearance. It's
    heavier than silk, but it's magical - and I'm sure that
    counts for something to someone. They tend to be found more
    on dark elves than gnomes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gossimer Robe</strong></font><br>
AC 8, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Gossimer armor in general is a good choice for the
    Necromancer. The robe in particular is quite nice, and is as
    white as bone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Flowing Black Robe</strong></font><br>
AC 8, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This robe provides very good protection (as far as robes
    go), and also grants the wearer a boon of +5 stamina and +3
    intelligence. Dark, sinister, and an excellent addition to
    your necromantic wardrobe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Green Silken Drape</strong></font><br>
AC 8, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This excellent robe will grant the wearer a boon of +9
    dexterity, +9 stamina, +3 intelligence, and +15 poison
    resistance, making it an excellent choice for the Necromancer
    who isn't afraid to wear green.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Robe of the Oracle</strong></font><br>
AC 9, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In addition to a high armor rating, this robe grants the
    wearer a boon of +5 wisdom, +5 intelligence, and +25 mana,
    making it highly sought after by spellcasters everywhere.
    Difficult to obtain, but well worth the effort if you can
    abide the sheer gaudiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Robe of Enshroudment</strong></font><br>
AC 9, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's just so black, it's perfect. Beyond the blackness, it
    grants the wearer a boon of +4 intelligence, +4 agility, +4
    fire resistance, and +4 cold resistance. The important thing,
    though, is that it's black.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shining Metallic Robe</strong></font><br>
AC 10, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Designed for defense, the wearer of this fine garment is
    granted a boon of +9 intelligence, +8 fire resistance, and +8
    cold resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Cryosilk Robe</strong></font><br>
AC 11, Magic, No Drop</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's comfortable, it has a stylish cut, and it grants the
    wearer boons of +9 dexterity, +13 stamina, +13 intelligence,
    and +35 mana. Only the most powerful Necromancers can even
    hope of obtaining one of these.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Blighted Robe<br>
</strong></font>AC 11, Magic, No Drop</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The ultimate in garb exclusively for the Necromancer, this
    dark robe resembles the Flowing Black Robe but sticks to the
    colors of night. Extremely difficult to get, but once
    obtained it will grant the wearer a boon of +10 dexterity,
    +10 stamina, +13 intelligence, and +40 mana. Ahhh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Crimson Robe of Alendine</strong></font><br>
AC 12, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Possibly the best robe in the world, this wonder of
    magical cloth grants the wearer a boon of +15 dexterity, +15
    intelligence, +50 health, and +50 mana. Of course, most
    Necromancers will never even see this, much less possess it.</p>
