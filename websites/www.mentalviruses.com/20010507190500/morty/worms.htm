<p><em>There are times when I have doubts about the path I have
chosen to follow. Why have I dedicated myself to bringing into
the world more terror and bloodshed when I could be singing
cheerful little gnomish ditties and making toys for children? At
times like those, I regain my faith by remembering those people
in the world who are completely and utterly worthless - not Good,
not Evil, just an inconvenient blob of flesh blocking the view of
the scenery. Such people remind me that death and decay have
their place in the grand scheme of making the world a more
beautiful place to live.</em></p>

<p><em>So, when one of these pointless wonders comes to my
attention, I rejoice in the gifts of Bertoxxulous. Revenge is a
dish best served with relish.</em></p>

<p><em>Currently, only one person has the supreme misfortune to
be on my bad side.</em></p>

Dwarf Cleric</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This miserable wretch managed to gain the trust of a good
    friend of mine, and then proceeded to steal everything from
    her corpse. While I have chided my friend for trusting a
    dwarf in the first place, I might have expected more from a
    so-called cleric. Messing with dead bodies is an invasion of
    necromantic turf in any case, and looting corpses is a
    professional insult. I look forward to watching this pathetic
    waste of dwarfmeat die in miserable agony. Over, and over,
    and over.</p>
