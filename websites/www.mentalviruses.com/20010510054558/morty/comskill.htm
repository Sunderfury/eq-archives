</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>Skills to share with your
enemies</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Combat skills will serve the Necromancer well for quite
some time, although over time the defensive skills become far
more important. With the exception of Dodge, all of these skills
are available from the beginning of the Necromancer's career, and
will rise at a reasonable pace during melee.</em></p>

<p><em>These skills are limited by level, and will not exceed a
value of 3x(level+1).</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Offense</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is general attacking ability with any weapon. It
    cannot be trained, and only advances through attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Defense</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Defense covers the general ability to avoid being hit in
    combat. Like Offense, it cannot be trained, and only advances
    through being attacked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dodge</strong></font><br>
Level 22</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Once this skill is acquired, the Necromancer will
    occasionally dodge an attack that would have been successful.
    Dodge rises rapidly in combat, so spending more than the
    single practice point to acquire the skill should not be
    necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>Weapon skills improve attack abilities when a weapon of
the particular type is used. These skills can be trained, and
advance at an average pace with attacks using a weapon of the
appropriate type. It is worth changing weapons occasionally at
low levels so that some skill may be acquired in all of the
weapon types - when a particularly nice magical weapon comes
along later, it's nice to be able to use it effectively. Weapon
skills are combat skills, limited by level to a maximum of
3x(level+1).</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Hand-to-Hand</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This skill covers barehanded fighting. While this may be
    useful at very low levels when on a mission of corpse
    recovery, it will never offer much damage to an enemy.
    Engaging in hand-to-hand combat until it has advanced a few
    times will increase the damage done by a bit, but it's really
    not worth any practice points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>One-Handed Blunt</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Necromancer is pretty much limited to the staff
    regarding weapons of this type, and may not have one to
    practice with at lower levels - few monsters carry a cracked
    staff, and the temptation to sell it is high since it
    commands a good price for a low level weapon. Since there are
    <a href="1hblunt.htm" target="Ground">one-handed blunt
    weapons</a> that will definitely attract the Necromancer's
    attention later on, though, it is worth finding a good staff
    keeping this skill up to par.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Two-Handed Blunt</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The great staff is much more common than the cracked
    staff, so finding a weapon to practice with at lower levels
    shouldn't be a problem. If there's a friendly magician in the
    neighborhood, have them conjure a staff up for you, as it
    will be much better than anything you'll find for a long
    time. Many <a href="2hblunt.htm" target="Ground">two-handed
    blunt weapons</a> are very good for the Necromancer, and this
    is the primary weapon for many.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Piercing</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Since the Necromancer starts out with a crude but
    effective dagger, this weapon skill tends to be the first to
    go up. <a href="piercing.htm" target="Ground">Piercing
    weapons</a> are necromantic favorites. Keeping this skill
    current is wise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Throwing</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This skill covers the use of shurikens, throwing knives,
    and other such range weapons. These weapons hit for
    relatively little damage, and are primarily used for getting
    the attention of a wandering monster so it will close to
    melee distance. Since the Necromancer has a wide selection of
    spells that are much more effective and have a greater range
    than thrown weapons, this skill is not particularly vital. In
    fact, these weapons can be ignored or not entirely at the
    Necromancer's whim. If desired, skill in throwing weapons
    could be cultivated between spell castings while your pet
    engages the enemy.</p>
