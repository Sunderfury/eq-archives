<p align="right"><font size="5"><em><strong>The Arts of
Civilization<br>
</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>Skills that make life
easier</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>The Necromancer does not spend every moment engaged in
life-or-death combat and manipulating dark powers. There are many
other worthwhile pursuits - hobbies, if you wish - which may be
found appealing. Some of these pursuits, of course, are more
appealing than others.</em></p>

<p><em>In the &quot;more appealing&quot; category are those
skills which offer the Necromancer alternatives to standing
around bored while waiting for that shadow knight to show up.
Some of these are entertaining diversions in and of themselves,
and some are more supportive by nature. All of them are available
to the starting Necromancer, and all are limited by level to a
maximum of 5x(level+1).</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Alcohol Tolerance</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most Necromancers tend to avoid drinking as a regular
    practice, since it leads to a temporary intelligence penalty.
    However, occasions do arise, and increases in this skill will
    help reduce the negative effects of imbibing. This skill is,
    not surprisingly, increased by drinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Begging</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Just in case the Necromancer is feeling too popular, the
    practice of begging is available to help stem the tide of
    love and adoration. Repeated begging attempts are an
    invitation to attack the beggar. Successful begging results
    in the gain of a few coins, although rumors persist of
    skilled beggars gaining powerful items from the right marks.
    While no self-respecting Necromancer needs this skill, some
    may find it amusing to pose as a beggar, and then blast
    uncharitable souls into oblivion when they refuse to cough up
    some change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bind Wound</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>By using this skill and a bandage, the Necromancer can
    heal small wounds. At lower levels this is quite expensive,
    as bandages cost around 5 silver a piece. When it becomes
    affordable, though, it is worth getting into practice, as the
    timely application of healing can be life-saving (and there
    won't always be a convenient rat to drain the soul out of).
    Having a friendly Magician on hand can be a great help in
    this, as they can conjure up bandages at a low level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Fishing</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ahhh, fishing. The <a href="fishintr.htm" target="Ground">natural
    extension of necromancy</a>. With a pole and some bait, you
    can acquire fish for food, daggers for your pets, sandals for
    your feet, and fish scales for spell reagents. It also gives
    you something to do while you're waiting for a boat, or
    meditating near water. All in all, a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Sense Heading</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The ability to know which way you're facing is amazingly
    useful. Practice this skill until you've reached the maximum
    for your level. Since this skill is particularly slow to
    advance at lower abilities, you'll be practicing it pretty
    much constantly until about level 5 or 6. It's tedious, but
    you'll be glad you did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Swimming</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Your level of ability in swimming determines how fast you
    swim, how quickly you lose stamina, and how long you can hold
    your breath. There are a lot of places that can only be
    reached by swimming, and quite a few places where swimming
    is, if not necessary, very convenient. Always keep your
    swimming skill reasonably high.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>Trade skills are used to create new items of various
types. This typically involves buying the appropriate pieces from
a merchant, putting them in some container, and combining the
pieces into a new, useful item. There are many things that can
only be obtained through the application of a trade skill.</em></p>

<p><em>As it turns out, the Necromancer is poorly suited to a
life of trade. Merchants will overcharge us for the items we need
(if they don't try to kill us outright), and they won't give us a
fair price when we sell back to them. It's a losing proposition.
As if that weren't enough, most of the things that come out of
the various trade skills are worthless to us. There are a couple
of exceptions, but for the most part, the Necromancer should
stick to killing things and raising the dead, and let the timid
spin their pots.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Baking</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Baking allows the creation of tasty food from otherwise
    inedible hunks of dead monsters. Aside from the obvious
    advantages of finding food in the wild and fewer trips to
    those pesky food merchants, it also gives you the chance to <a
    href="offering.htm" target="Ground">share some food</a> with
    your companions. Baked goods are also noticeably lighter than
    rations for the weight-conscious. This is one trade skill the
    Necromancer is advised to pursue - there's nothing like
    devouring your enemies. Baking doesn't advance very quickly,
    but it's not painfully slow to do so either. Just don't try
    to get your ingredients from the baker in the West Plains of
    Karana.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Brewing</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>By taking a few odd ingredients and mixing them properly,
    you can create an alcoholic beverage. Whoopee. Alcohol
    decreases your intelligence (unless you've got a great deal
    of alcohol tolerance), which isn't exactly what we're looking
    for. The skill does go up fast and the ingredients are cheap,
    but Necromancers are some of the soberest folks I've met.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Fletching</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Every Necromancer I know just can't wait to walk into
    Kelethin to pick up the fletching supplies to start a trade
    in creating bows and arrows for their Warrior and Ranger
    friends. Right. This skill is for those pitiable fools who
    can't call down necromantic doom to consume an enemy on the
    other side of a river.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Jewel Craft</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Skilled jewelers are able to combine metals and gems to
    create both magical and nonmagical rings, necklaces, and so
    on. Top of the line jewelry items are in reasonable demand
    and command a respectable price. There's a long tradition of
    gnomish jewelry making; sadly, Necromancers make lousy
    jewelers. Only Enchanters can enchant metals, and enchanted
    metal is required to make magical jewelry. If you can get
    enchanted metal, the sheer cost of the ingredients is
    daunting even if you're not hated by merchants. As if that
    weren't enough, the skill tends to advance slowly and
    failures destroy your expensive ingredients. Leave this to
    our Enchanter brethren.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Pottery</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There are a lot of things that a potter can make,
    including bowls, statues, and vials. Some of these items are
    used in other trade skills, and a few are useful on their
    own, so potters are occasionally in demand. Personally, I can
    think of nothing more dull. If you could make burial urns,
    canopic jars, or tombstones, there might be some appeal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Smithing</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A smith can sharpen rusty weapons, create useful metal
    things like skewers, and will eventually aspire to create
    armor. This is a good and useful skill, worthy of a gnome's
    time and talents. It's also pretty much worthless to a
    Necromancer. More expensive than pottery but less expensive
    than jewel craft, this skill increases at a reasonable rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Tailoring</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>By taking dead animal skins and following patterns, it is
    possible to create fairly decent armor and a handful of other
    useful items. Most armor is not suitable to a Necromancer,
    but advanced tailors can make silk garments that are quite
    serviceable. Patterns aren't very expensive, and certainly
    weigh less than pelts, so this might be an interesting hobby
    for some since you get to play with dead bodies. Tailoring
    increases at a reasonable rate as skills go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Tinker</strong></font><br>
Level 16</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Every gnome grows up learning how to tinker. Even the
    youngest gnome Necromancer has a tinkering skill of 50,
    although this cannot be increased without gaining 16 levels
    of experience. A gnome with a toolbox and some odds and ends
    can put together quite a few interesting things, from the
    standard compass to the unusual stalking probe to the famed
    aqua lung. There are a few unfortunate facts that keep this
    skill from being the true joy it deserves to be, however: the
    unique parts necessary are only available around Ak'Anon and
    Steamfont; the special parts range from somewhat to extremely
    expensive; failure is common and destroys all of those
    expensive parts; and, just to make things worse, the skill
    increases at a very, very slow rate. The true gnome will give
    it a try in spite of these difficulties.</p>

<p>&quot;Look out! He's got a... a... some kind of weird gnome
thing that looks threatening...&quot;</p>
