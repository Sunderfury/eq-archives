<p><em>There was once a time, and it was not so long ago, when
the civilized races of Norrath laughed at us gnomes for our
tinkering. Yes, they laughed! But NOW, my friend, things are
different! Now... well, they still laugh, but there are a couple
of tinkered items that are somewhat useful so the laughing is
more of a snickering.</em></p>

<p>Tinkering is a fine gnomish pursuit with a long and troubled
history. Before getting too far into the nuts and bolts of
things, one would do well to keep a few things in mind.</p>

<p>Rumors abound regarding what can and cannot be made, whether
certain items even exist, and how difficult it is to advance in
skill. Remember that before you start throwing hundreds of
platinum on components you've never heard of.</p>

<p>There's another important point that, to the best of my
knowledge, no one has commented on. <strong>Tinkering is properly
the realm of the gnomish Rogue.</strong> Warriors come in a close
second. This is worth noting point by point:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Any gnome can tinker, but spellcasting gnomes can easily
        duplicate through magic many of the effects of tinkered
        items. No magician is going to spend 18 pp on a Stalking
        Probe, no wizard is going to spend 25 pp for a Spyglass,
        and no spellcaster is going to spend 250 pp for an
        Aqualung. All of these things, however, could be handy to
        a Rogue or Warrior.</li>
    <li>Rogues are the only class that can use every single
        tinkered item, specifically including the Standard Bow
        Cam and the Mechanized Lockpicks. (The exception to this
        is the Gem Cutter, which no one seems able to use.)
        Warriors can use everything but the Lockpicks.</li>
    <li>More than anyone else, mid to high level Rogues can
        afford to buy the components.</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, the process of tinkering isn't particularly
difficult, and can be broken down into six easy steps.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Visit Steamfont and Ak'Anon.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Nearly everything you need to start out your tinkering
    career can be acquired from Bom Knotwood in Steamfont. When
    you get to extremely advanced tinkering, Rylin Coil in
    Ak'Anon can give you some further direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Buy the books.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The books are cheap and entertaining, and they contain all
    of the recipes you'll need. Every gnome should be proud to
    have the complete Journals of Gimblestan in their library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Buy a Toolbox.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The toolbox is the centerpiece of tinkering. You can't
    tinker without one. It can also be a handy container, as it's
    fairly light and you can fit nearly anything into it, as long
    as you're careful not to combine its contents by accident in
    a fit of tinkering frenzy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Spend all of your money on components.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Unless you're limiting yourself to Animated Bait, you're
    going to be spending quite a lot of platinum just to get the
    fiddlybits that you'll need to even attempt a tinkered item.
    Most components can be found with Bom, and the rest are
    common items found in many places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Combine the components in the Toolbox.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Follow the recipe for what you're trying to make. Place
    each item in the toolbox, making sure that nothing is
    stacked. When all of the items are in the toolbox, invoke the
    Spirit of Gimblestan and Combine. It's just that easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Cackle or curse.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Either you'll be left with your newfangled invention, or
    you'll be kicking and screaming and generally unpleasant.
    Such is the fate of the gnome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Watch out! I've got a toolbox, and I'm not afraid to use
it!&quot;</p>
