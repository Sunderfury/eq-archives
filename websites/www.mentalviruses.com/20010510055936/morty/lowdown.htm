</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>The truth about the tiny
terrors</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Raw statistics aside, there are quite a few important
things to consider in the life of a gnome Necromancer. Some items
are common knowledge, but other bits of wisdom may have eluded
the less-than-arduous seeker.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gnomes are short.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Really short. This is usually an advantage, since a gnome
    can crawl through some spaces where a human would have
    troubles and a troll could never go. In a few instances,
    though, this can be a problem, typically when a step or a
    ledge is too high to reach by jumping. Unfortunately, one of
    these instances involves one of the boats that cross the
    Ocean of Tears - when it arrives at the dock, a gnome can't
    get on board without first jumping to one of the posts on the
    pier. As an interesting footnote, gnomes can't be shrunk, and
    when other races shrink they just become gnome-sized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gnomes are small.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Aside from just being short, this means that only items
    which can be worn by the small races are available. While
    this means that a gnome's armor tends to weigh less, it also
    limits the selection of items that can be worn or used. There
    are quite a few pieces of equipment that a Necromancer would
    find useful, but a gnome can't equip. On the other hand,
    there are a handful of interesting things that only a small
    race can wear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gnomes have infravision.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some people have said that gnomes have ultravision, but
    trust me, it's infravision. Our ability to see in the dark is
    quite well developed and is handier than a squid with gloves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gnomes are tinkers.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In theory, this means that any gnome of sufficient
    development (call it level 16) can pick up a toolbox, throw
    in some odds and ends, and create a useful little widget that
    the world will love. In practice, the pieces are expensive,
    everything you need is only available in Steamfont and
    Ak'Anon, and we can only make a handful of doodads that are
    either relatively useless or too pricy for what they're
    worth. On the other hand, it can lead to a great deal of
    amusement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gnomes are neutral.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In Norrath, there are evil races (the ogres, trolls, and
    dark elves) and good races (pretty much everyone else). These
    races are at each others' throats in various states of war,
    and are typically killed on sight in opposing cities. Gnomes
    are recognized as neither good nor evil, and no one is trying
    to exterminate us. This gives us the potential, at least, to
    get along very well anywhere, although this is strongly
    counteracted by the Necromancer's religious beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Necromancers are not very popular.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Quite a lot of people, mostly of the &quot;good&quot;
    races, seem to have a problem with necromancy. While the
    sensible reaction would be to run away screaming in terror,
    the more typical reaction is to attack on sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bertoxxulous and his worshippers are
not very popular at all.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some people who have no particular problem with necromancy
    will fly into a murderous rage when they spot a minion of the
    Plaguebringer. Sometimes this is predictable, as in the case
    of nearly every druid in the world. Sometimes this comes as a
    surprise, as in the case of the human merchant baker in the
    Western Plains of Karana. In either case, it can cause
    problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Necromancers can work independently.</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>While any class of adventurer can go solo to a greater or
    lesser degree, the Necromancer can rely on it for a long
    time. With a collection of spells that can call up a powerful
    pet, do a great deal of damage over time, and heal the
    caster, the Necromancer can be extremely self-sufficient.</p>
