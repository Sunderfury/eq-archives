</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>Skills in the dark arts</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Magical skills cover the prime abililties of the
Necromancer, from raising the dead to meditation. They will be
used very frequently, and as a result most of them should not
necessitate spending any training points beyond the initial
&quot;purchase&quot; of the skill. With the exception of
Research, these skills are limited by level to a maximum of
5x(level+1).</em></p>

<p><em>Three magical skills are determinations of general magical
ability. Mastery is essential.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Channeling</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Channeling is the ability to manipulate mana, and it is
    the core of spellcasting. Among other things, it determines
    the chances of successfully recovering from an interrupted
    spellcasting. This skill will rise quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Meditation</strong></font><br>
Level 4</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Necromancer in meditation regains mana faster than by
    merely sitting. However, as meditation involves poring over
    one's spellbook, meditating Necromancers don't see much,
    although they can still hear what goes on around them. It
    should also be noted that meditating Necromancers make
    excellent targets, and creatures which would normally walk
    right by may decide to attack instead. Once acquired from the
    guildmaster, this skill will go up quickly through use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Research</strong></font><br>
Level 16</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When the Necromancer reaches the 16th level of power, good
    spells become increasingly difficult to find, and it becomes
    necessary to acquire spells through research. This skill
    makes that possible. Research is limited by level to a
    maximum of 5x(level-15).</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>The spells that form the foundation of our Incredible
Necromantic Power are found in all five classes of magic, and the
skill of the Necromancer will rise rapidly in these areas through
use - with one exception, noted below.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Abjuration</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Spells of abjuration are protective in nature, typically
    through enhancing armor or boosting resistance. While the
    Necromancer does not have a very wide selection of these
    spells, the ones available are quite beneficial and will be
    used very frequently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Alteration</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most of the spells that the Necromancer uses are
    alterations of one form or another. This includes the
    majority of the combat spells, along with the spells we use
    to boost the abilities of our pets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Conjuration</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The necromantic spells that summon the dead are all
    conjurations, as are the combat spells involving disease and
    poison. Even though conjurations won't tend to be used as
    often as the alteration spells, they are still vital to the
    Necromancer's power and should be used frequently enough to
    keep the skill level high.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Divination</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There are only a few spells of necromantic divination, and
    they won't be used very often. However, when the time comes
    to pull one out, nothing else will do - these spells include
    Locate Corpse and Gather Shadows. Divination goes up quickly
    through casting, but you'll probably have to set aside some
    time for repeated castings of a simple spell - like Sense
    Magic - to keep your skill level at its peak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Evocation</strong></font><br>
Level 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Necromancer has very few spells of evocation. All of
    them strike an enemy directly for damage, and most of them
    are only effective on the undead. They cast slowly, and there
    is a long wait between castings. In addition, the first
    evocation spell isn't available until level 8, so your skill
    level will be zero until then. Since these spells are useful
    in particular situations, it is worthwhile to make an effort
    towards raising the skill level, either through repeated
    castings (which means spending a lot of time blasting
    skeletons and such after level 8) or by spending training
    points with the guildmaster.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>Specialization in a class of magic allows for the
possibility of casting spells in that class for less mana, having
a decreased chance of spell interruption, and producing fewer
fizzles. As such , it is a good thing indeed. The catch is that
only one specialization may increase beyond a skill level of 50 -
the first of these skills to go over 50 is the Necromancer's
prime specialization. Choosing the proper specialization,
therefore, is worthy of some consideration. Specializations go up
quickly, and should not require training points beyond the first
spent to acquire the skill. Like other skills of magic, the
primary specialization is limited by level to a maximum of
5x(level+1), while the other specializations will not exceed 50.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Specialize: Abjuration</strong></font><br>
Level 20</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Since the Necromancer will almost always be using spells
    of abjuration previous to combat, and since these spells are
    not very mana-intensive to begin with, there is little to
    recommend this specialization as a Necromancer's primary
    choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Specialize: Alteration</strong></font><br>
Level 20</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Alteration spells form the majority of the Necromancer's
    combat arsenal. While these spells do not tend to use an
    extreme amount of mana, anything that makes them cheaper and
    less likely to fail is a great boon. This is the obvious
    choice for the primary specialization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Specialize: Conjuration</strong></font><br>
Level 20</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Conjurations form the second largest class of spells for
    the Necromancer. Approximately half of the conjurations are
    the spells used to summon our undead pets, which are very
    expensive in terms of mana. Most of the rest are combat
    spells, where spell failure can be fatal. With that in mind,
    this would also be a reasonable choice as the primary
    specialization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Specialize: Divination</strong></font><br>
Level 20</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>With less than a dozen divination spells for the
    Necromancer, all of them cheap and not likely to be cast
    during combat, there is no reason at all to make this a
    primarily specialization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Specialize: Evocation</strong></font><br>
Level 20</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>All of the Necromancer's spells of evocation are combat
    spells, and all of them use more mana that you'd like, so it
    is somewhat conceivable that this could be a Necromancer's
    primary specialization. However, with less than ten spells of
    this nature, most of which only effect undead, evocation
    would be a very narrow specialization indeed.</p>
