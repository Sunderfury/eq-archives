<p align="center"><em>Whilst peacefully meditating in the plains
of South Karana, I was approached by a rather large elephant with
a gigantic cracked tusk. Since this injured incisor seemed to be
causing the beast a great deal of pain - and since he kept goring
me with it - I decided to take up some amateur dentistry and
remove the offending ivory. I was successful, but my first dental
patient didn't survive the procedure. I was crushed - but I
finally managed to crawl out from under the corpse.</em></p>

knows of any use for it, just </em><a
