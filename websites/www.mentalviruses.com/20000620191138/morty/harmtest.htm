<p><em>After Harmshield had repeatedly saved my wee body from
being slashed, bashed, and pierced, I began to wonder what else
it might protect me from. Oddly enough, no one I talked to could
answer a simple but interesting question: Does Harmshield protect
you from falling damage?</em></p>

<p><em>Since I was passing through East Karana at the time, I
decided to find out for myself.</em></p>

<p>And so I determine the answer to my question: YES! Harmshield
will protect you from a ridiculous amount of falling damage. This
will no doubt prove to be useful later, aside from the sheer
entertainment value (&quot;I know a shortcut. Follow me. Of
course it's safe...&quot;).</p>

<p>I wonder if it keeps you safe from lava...</p>
