<p><em>I heard the man splashing along the shore in the darkness,
heading my direction. He was clearly lost, and his look of relief
when he finally glanced down and noticed me was just short of
pathetic. &quot;Good sir,&quot; he began. Wrong on both counts, I
thought to myself. &quot;If you would be so kind as to direct me
towards the nearest dwelling, I would be most grateful.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>I almost smiled as I stared out over the lake. &quot;The
nearest dwelling is the house of the dead, and you are very
nearly there.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>The look of relief melted away from his face like dripping
wax. &quot;I meant... the nearest town. If you please. Sir.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;The nearest town,&quot; I replied without bothering
to glance up, &quot;is of little use to someone as close to death
as yourself.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>He stumbled back. &quot;Death?&quot; Nervousness entered
his voice now, and the very edge of fear. &quot;Surely, ah, the
essence of life flows through this land and this water, and, ah,
no death will come to us... this... um... night...&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; I said in my best scary voice.
&quot;There will be death here. Tonight. Now.&quot; I watched him
step back with the sweet gleam of terror in his eyes as I
chuckled, gestured with my hands... and pulled in another fish.</em></p>

<p>My name is Morty. I am a Necromancer. And I fish.</p>

<p>Some of my more philosophical friends have questioned my
pastime. &quot;Morty,&quot; they say, &quot;you are a fearsome
deliverer of bloodshed and pain, the very incarnation of that
grim darkness we call mortality.&quot; (You can see why I keep
such friends around.) &quot;Why do you pursue a hobby that even
an illiterate barbarian can excel in, when you could be spreading
unholy terror throughout the world?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Completeness,&quot; I tell them. &quot;It's important to
kill the little things, too.&quot;</p>

<p>It began simply enough. I was sitting on a pier near the Mines
of Malfunction, passing the time by looking through my grub
collection. (Yes, my grub collection. Getting the perfect level
of decay for a corpse absolutely demands having the proper grubs
around. Trust me, every Necromancer has a grub collection and can
talk about it for hours. If they deny it, they're lying to you.)
One of the grubs slipped through my fingers and into the water,
where it was almost immediately devoured by a passing fish. Of
course... here was my solution to the outrageous prices charged
by the food merchants. A simple fishing pole and a few specimens
from my collection would save me quite a bit of coin.</p>

<p>After sitting a while on the docks, I began to contemplate the
deeper meaning of my newfound hobby. I impale the grub on a hook,
consigning it to a writhing, squirming death. I use the grub's
death throes to attract a fish, which I pull out of the water to
its gasping, wheezing end. Another fish that I will never see has
lost its meal, and is now heading for starvation. So much
fatality, merely to provide me with a simple snack. It was
irresistible. Naming the grubs after the food merchants only made
it more enjoyable.</p>

<p>And so now throughout the course of my travels, wherever I may
be, I make sure to spend a few hours slaughtering the scaly
inhabitants of the deep. It's the least I can do.</p>

<p>&quot;Death is the ultimate party crasher.&quot;</p>
