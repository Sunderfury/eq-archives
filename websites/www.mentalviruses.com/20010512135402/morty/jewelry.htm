<p><em>As the Necromancer progresses in power and strength, it
becomes less and less wise to enter melee with opponents of
similar stature. Enemies will be taken down with Incredible
Necromantic Power alone, and kept at a distance. When this time
comes, the benefits of additional armor are less than the
benefits of personal enhancement. Jewelry becomes much more
desireable.</em></p>

<p><em>Any jewelry items that increase personal abilities are
obviously useful. Many such trinkets are available from jewelers,
particular those jewelers who are also enchanters, and can be
obtained for a reasonable fee without much effort. A few special
items, though, are more difficult to come by, and will
particularly attract the attention of the Necromancer.</em></p>

<p><em>Necklaces can offer many benefits, but may not be the
first choice for jewelry since quite a few pieces of neck armor
are also magical.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Beaded Slime Necklace</strong></font><br>
AC 0</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This amusing little trinket grants the wearer a boon of +5
    intelligence. And it's slime. What Necromancer doesn't like
    slime? At least in theory?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Intestine Necklace</strong></font><br>
AC 0, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It makes a statement. It also grants the wearer a boon of
    +5 health.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Petrified Erudite Heart Amulet</strong></font><br>
AC 2, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ahhh, there's nothing quite like a good relic, especially
    if it means ripping the heart from an Erudite. Pretentious
    imposters, most of them, although I've meet a few who were
    worthy of respect. Wear this proudly and be granted a boon of
    +5 intelligence and +15 mana.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Rings are convenient bits of magical jewelry. They don't
deprive you of otherwise available armor, there are many good
rings to be found, and you can wear two of them. Of the many
rings available, a few of them may offer the Necromancer more
than a little amusement.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Band of Flesh</strong></font><br>
AC 0, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This twisted bit of someone else's skin offers the wearer
    a boon of +2 strength.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Ring of Slime</strong></font><br>
AC 0, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It goes well with the Beaded Slime Necklace, and grants
    the wearer a boon of +10 mana.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Ring of Shadows</strong></font><br>
AC 0, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Not only will this necromantically-enhanced ring grant the
    wearer a boon of +2 dexterity, it also holds charges of
    Gather Shadows. This really isn't what a good Necromancer
    needs, but it makes a good gift to others to show your favor.
    Why not get a set of them - maybe nine - and give them to
    some mortal men doomed to die?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Platinum Skull Ring</strong></font><br>
AC 0, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Flaunt your affiliation with death by wearing this elegant
    platinum ring, which grants the wearer a boon of +30 health
    and +20 mana. It scares the commoners, so there's a penalty
    of -5 charisma, but what do they know?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>There's nothing like a bit of shiny metal to highlight the
grandeur of the gnomish ear. Earrings are more than just
decorations or an extra source of magic - they are part of a
tradition that hearkens back to the very founders of Ak'Anon.
Wear them proudly, even if you can't get one of these truly dark
ones.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Polished Bone Hoop</strong></font><br>
AC 0</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This cheerful ring of bone complements all of that bone
    armor, and grants the wearer a boon of +10 mana.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Batskull Earrings</strong></font><br>
AC 0, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This quaint bit of jewelry reminds me of the tiny bats
    that used to flutter around my bedchamber back home. Why, I
    remember when I was just a wee little lad, and... well, I
    don't want to bore you with the details. One of these
    earrings will grant the wearer a boon of +5 intelligence, and
    you can't go wrong with that.</p>
