<p><em>If you've been using a dagger or a single-handed staff,
you may have noticed that you've got a spare hand. Why not carry
around something more interesting than a Coldstone? There are a
lot of options, but a few of them will be particularly attractive
to the fashion-conscious minion of the Plaguebringer.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Orb of Slime<br>
</strong></font><font size="3">Magic</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you're going with a slime theme for your accouterments,
    then you'll naturally want this orb. Besides nicely setting
    off other items of slime, the Orb of Slime grants the wielder
    a boon of +5 health and +15 mana.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Skull of Jhen'Tra<br>
</strong></font><font size="3">Magic, Lore</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Every Necromancer should have a few spare skulls sitting
    around, and this one is a good addition. It grants the
    wielder a boon of +3 resistance to magic and +20 mana.
    Sometimes I wonder where all the headless Jhen'Tra bodies
    are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Black Tome with Silver Runes<br>
</strong></font><font size="3">Magic</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There's nothing like carrying a book around to impress
    people with your dedication to study. In addition to
    accentuating that scholarly look, this book will grant the
    wielder a boon of +4 intelligence and +30 mana.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Jeweled Skull<br>
</strong></font><font size="3">Magic, Lore</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you're willing to invest some time and effort - well, a
    lot of time and effort - you can acquire one of these
    ever-so-necromantic skulls. It grants the wielder a boon of
    +5 intelligence, +5 resistance to magic, +20 health, and +20
    mana. Unfortunately, it also radiates the cold of the grave,
    so it gives a penalty of -5 resistance to cold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Harvester<br>
</strong></font>AC 4, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There's nothing quite like a large scythe to say,
    &quot;I've come about the reaping.&quot; This particularly
    grim tool grants the wielder a boon of +5 strength and +5
    intelligence. The lucky necromancer is also blessed with
    Deadeye. Like so many purely necromantic things, there is
    also a penalty - in this case, -5 charisma. Naturally, that
    makes it all the more attractive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Words of Darkness<br>
</strong></font>Magic, Lore, No Drop</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>More than just a book, this dark tome grants the wielder
    the Allure of Death and a boon of +45 mana. Acquiring this
    may make you some new enemies, but you'll soon get over the
    loss.</p>
