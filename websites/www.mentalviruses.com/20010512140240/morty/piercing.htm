</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>A quick stab in the dark</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>In terms of weapon selection, the Necromancer has more
sharp pointy things to choose from than either variety of blunt
sticks. The piercing weapons are faster than the staves, but do
less damage per hit. Faster is good, since it gives you a greater
chance to interrupt your target if they're trying to cast a
spell; faster can also be bad, since you can interrupt your own
spellcasting with your attacks. More attacks per combat also
means a greater chance of melee-related spells (like Vampiric
Embrace) going off in any given combat.</em></p>

<p><em>Since piercing weapons leave the secondary hand free to
hold other items, some Necromancers prefer those weapons over the
more damaging two-handed staff.</em></p>

<p><em>The standard piercing weapon is the dagger.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dagger </strong><em><strong>(starter)</strong></em></font><br>
3 damage, 24 delay, No Drop</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The dagger which you start out with cannot be dropped or
    traded. It is otherwise the equivalent of a Rusty Dagger,
    which makes you wonder exactly how much the Necromancer's
    guild values its new recruits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Rusty Dagger</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 24 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The ubiquitous weapon. They're everywhere. Humans carry
    them. Monsters carry them. Undead carry them. You'll fish
    them out of lakes and rivers. There's just no escape from the
    Rusty Dagger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Tarnished Dagger</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 22 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Take a Rusty Dagger and a sharpening stone, do a little
    blacksmithing, and you get a Tarnished Dagger. It's the
    equivalent of bronze in combat, but it still fails to impress
    anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bronze Dagger</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 22 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Functional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dagger</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 20 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The standard model dagger is 10 percent faster than the
    bronze model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Fine Steel Dagger</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 19 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's faster than your basic dagger, but it's hard to shake
    the feeling that someday you'll drop it in the woods and it
    will get rusty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Combine Dagger</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 19 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you need something that's quick, lightweight, and hits
    for magical damage, this is a reasonable weapon. The Combine
    knew how to make 'em.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>A friendly Magician can call up a magical weapon for you
or your pet. Like all conjured weapons, these will disappear from
your hands when you camp.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dagger</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 21 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This dagger can be conjured up by any Magician with the
    1st level summoning spell. If they can't get you one of
    these, mock them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Giant Snake Fang</strong></font><br>
5 damage, 26 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Very similar to the fangs found in the wild, this fang can
    be conjured up by a Magician of at least 12 levels with the
    proper spell. This one is a touch faster, though, and hits
    for magical damage, making it definitely superior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dagger of Symbols</strong></font><br>
5 damage, 20 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Conjured up by a Magician with the 39th level summoning
    spell, this mystical dagger grants the wielder a boon of +5
    resistance to magic, poison, and disease. It can also be kept
    as a range weapon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Exotic daggers are much, much nicer than any dagger the
Combine ever made.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dagger of Marnek</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 30 delay, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The dark power invested in this dagger grants the wielder
    a boon of +3 intelligence and +15 mana. Created specifically
    for the Necromancer, this dagger is intended for ritual, not
    combat - it's slow, hits for little damage, and does not hit
    for magical damage. However, it can be usefully kept on hand
    by putting it where you'd place a throwing dagger. Just be
    careful not to throw it, of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Sacrificial Dagger</strong></font><br>
5 damage, 21 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ahhh, sacrifice. The <em>[ahem]</em> lifeblood of the
    Necromancer. The stored energy of this grim blade's numerous
    victims allow it to grant it's wielder a boon of +5
    intelligence. This is the dagger of choice for the
    discriminating Necromancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dragoon Dirk</strong></font><br>
6 damage, 23 delay, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The dirk's magic offers it's wielder a boon of +2
    dexterity and +3 resistance to magic. Very nice, but perhaps
    better suited to a Rogue rather than a Necromancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Stiletto of the Bloodclaw</strong></font><br>
6 damage, 23 delay, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In addition to quickly dealing out a respectable amount of
    magical damage, the stiletto occasionally hits its
    unfortunate victim with Blood Claw, which looks ever so
    necromantic when it happens. An excellent choice for the
    battle-oriented Necromancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Animal parts can make good weapons, too...</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Swordfish Bill</strong></font><br>
4 damage, 30 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Interesting, yes, but imposing? Hardly. &quot;Ooo, look
    out, it's that scary Necromancer with the fish nose!&quot;
    I'd be embarassed to be seen with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Crookstinger</strong></font><br>
4 damage, 21 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This little sticker is the business end of a giant wasp,
    and it's got a weak poison on it just for extra kick. Nasty,
    but not particularly world-shattering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Giant Snake Fang</strong></font><br>
5 damage, 27 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's a little slow for a piercing weapon, but the damage
    is nice. Don't confuse it with the fang that Magicians can
    summon, though - this one isn't magical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>In the quest for stabbing with style, a few odd things
have been picked up and poked into people. Some have been more
effective than others.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Butcher Knife</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 24 delay, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Honestly, I wouldn't call my last butcher knife injury a
    &quot;piercing&quot; by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Crysknife</strong></font><br>
4 damage, 21 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Magical and fast, and it's good enough for everyday use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Mithril Quill</strong></font><br>
4 damage, 19 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Scary things happen when scholars defend themselves.
    Through powers best left to the imagination, this quill
    grants the wielder a boon of +20 health.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Obsidian Shard</strong></font><br>
6 damage, 25 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In addition to decent magical damage, the shard will
    occasionally fire off Obsidian Shatter on its melee target.
    There's a certain raw power about this that suits a
    Necromancer well. Find it, use it.</p>
