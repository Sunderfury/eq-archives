the masses</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>A tip o' the Silk Lined Steel Helm goes to Gnomad, who
collected much of the information here and kept interest going
through some painful stages of tinkering. Those who remember the
table of failed attempts trying to make the Collapsible Fishing
Pole will know what I mean. He will be [sniff] remembered fondly.</em></p>

<p><em>All of the original tinkering recipes are easily available
in the vicinity of Ak'Anon. The same is true for most of the odd
components necessary.</em></p>

<p></em>Tinker wisely, for attempting something far beyond your
current ability will result in losing great gobs of platinum.</em></p>

<p><em>Costs are based on a gnome with typical gnomish charisma
and an indifferent relationship to the vendors, and are rounded
up to the nearest coin. Your prices may vary.</em></p>

<p><em>There's still a lot of information missing here, and I'm
not rich. Any information that you could send my way would be
greatly appreciated.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Animated Bait</strong></font><br>
Trivial at 50, cost 4 cp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Cork, Spriket.</p>
    <p>It's bait. It looks like regular bait, works like regular
    bait, and costs just as much as regular bait.  Weirdly enough,
	it's also food...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Compass</strong></font><br>
Trivial at 50, cost 3 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Pie Tin, Skewers, Water Flask, Static Orb, Cork.</p>
    <p>You might have seen one of these for sale, as a few
    merchants carry them. Using the compass tells you what
    direction you're facing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Firewater<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 50, cost 8 sp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Water Flask, Gnomish Spirits.</p>
    <p>Firewater is useful for creating other tinkered items, but
    doesn't seem to do much by itself. Tests continue. If you're
    having trouble finding Gnomish Spirits, head for a nearby
    still and toss in some Rice, Spider Legs, Rat Ears, and a
    Bottle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gnomish Fireworks<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 50, cost 2 gp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Metal Shaft, Bat Wing, Firewater.</p>
    <p>Mixing up a batch of these will give you four separate
    pieces of gnomish fireworks, each one with a slightly
    different effect. Early gnomish fireworks were <em>[ahem]</em>
    less impressive than one might have wanted, but current
    efforts seem to be well rewarded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Collapsible Fishing Pole</strong></font><br>
Trivial at 50, cost 7 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Three Metal Rods, Gnomish Bolts.</p>
    <p>The long-elusive Collapsible Fishing Pole is less than
    half the weight of a standard fishing pole, and fits into
    smaller containers. Aside from that, it works just like a
    fishing pole ought to. The downside to this is that it breaks
    just as often as a regular fishing pole, despite the fact
    that it costs 30 times as much. You make the call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Flameless Lantern<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 68, cost 2 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Large Lantern, Twine, Firewater.</p>
    <p>Hold it like a lantern, and it provides at least as much
    light as a greater lightstone. Unlike a regular lantern, this
    one will work underwater. Since not too many gnomes carry
    lanterns, it can also make a good conversation piece - I was
    once asked, &quot;What kind of stein is that?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Mechanized Lockpicks<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 68, cost 18 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Gear, Sprocket, Lockpicks, Rat Ears.</p>
    <p>Rogues and Bards can use a set of these much as they would
    a standard set of lockpicks. We can hope that the mechanized
    lockpicks do a better job, but with the relatively low number
    of locked doors in the world, it's a bit hard to tell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Thermal Cloak<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at &gt;68, cost at least 1 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Metal Rod, Firewater, Tattered Gnomish Cloak.</p>
    <p>With the discovery of the Tattered Gnomish Cloak in
	Solusek's Eye, it is now possible to create the Thermal
	Cloak.  Any gnome can wear this fine bit of protection,
	which has an armor class of 6 and provides a +20 bonus
	to cold resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Standard Bow Cam<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 75, cost 15 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Gear, Grease, Gnomish Bolts.</p>
    <p>These cams can be used by a skilled fletcher to create
    powerful bows (which would technically make them a bowyer,
    but we won't get into that). Unlike many other tinkered
    items, this is actually cheaper to make than it is to buy, so
    the standard bow cam enjoys some small degree of popularity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Spyglass<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 95, cost 26 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Bottle, Metal Twine, Metal Rod, Reflective Shard,
    Collapsible Fishing Pole</p>
    <p>If you haven't broken your collapsible fishing pole yet,
    this is the next logical thing to do with it after fishing.
    The effects of the spyglass are similar to a Wizard's Glimpse
    spell, giving the wielder telescopic vision. This can be
    handy for all sorts of things, which makes the spyglass one
    of the most useful bits of tinkering we've got.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Stalking Probes<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 102, cost 18 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Two Gears, Bottle, Metal Rod, Firewater.</p>
    <p>This weird device allows the user to send out a giant
    floating eyeball to look around, similar to the Eye of Zomm
    spell. The probes hold five charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gem Cutter<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 104?, cost at least 19 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Metal Rod, Cam, Metal Fastening, Firewater,
    Grease, Diamond Dust.</p>
    <p>There are two oddities with the Gem Cutter.
    First off, you won't be able to buy Diamond Dust from a
    vendor - it only seems to be found on certain ice giants
    (possibly as a cosmetic). Second, no one has figured out how
    to make the darned thing work. You would think that, just
    maybe, it somehow cuts gems. Research continues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Powered Gloves<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 122, cost 45 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Steel Lined Gloves, Sprocket, Gear, Metal Twine,
	Firewater.</p>
    <p>If you often find yourself a bit overburdened,
	you can put together a pair of these fine gloves that any gnome can
	use.  While they don't qualify as armor, they do add 5 strength while
	weighing next to nothing.  Always handy to have around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Catapult<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 135, cost at least 55 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Shaped Ashwood Bow with hemp string, Sproket,
	Gear, Metal Twine, Firewater.</p>
    <p>Here's another example of how gnomes drive
	themselves crazy.  You'll need a skilled fletcher to create the
	bow, and prices will vary.  As if that weren't frustrating enough,
	no one has yet succeeding in getting any action out of thing, putting
	it into the same category as the Gem Cutter.  You might expect it
	to throw things.  Hmmph.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Aqualung<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 148, cost 262 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Fine Coral Mesh, Silk Lined Steel Helm, Metal Twine,
    Gnomish Bolts, Metal Rod, Fresh Fish.</p>
    <p>A legendary item that was finally rediscovered, the
    aqualung (not surprisingly) allows the wearer to breath
    underwater. There are 50 charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Rebreather<br>
</strong></font>Trivial at 175, cost at least 916 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Lime Coated Meshing, Shark Skin Tubing, Platemail Helm
    (medium), Metal Fastening, Firewater, Aqualung.</p>
    <p>The improved version of the aqualung, this pricy gadget
    uses no charges and never leaves you gasping for air deep
    beneath the waves. I'm sure there will be a good market for
    them once they can be made with a relatively high degree of
    success.</p>

<p><em>The gnome pirates of Velious have extended the realm of
tinkering, providing us with a few more odds and ends.  Their
most significant contribution is revealing the secrets of
<a href="watcharm.htm" target="Ground">Watchman armor</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>These recipes may require the use of the Deluxe Tool Kit,
which is also available from the pirates.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Telescopic Eyepatch</strong></font><br>
Trivial at &lt;104, cost ?? pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Low Quality Dire Wolf Fur, Gnomish Bolts, Reflective Shard,
	Velium Lens.</p>
    <p>This compact little device is the improved version of the Spyglass.
	Put it right on your face for an additional 3 AC and use it whenever
	you like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Footwarming Boots</strong></font><br>
Trivial at ??, cost &gt;142 pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Small Fine Plate Boots (unstained), Sharkskin Tubing,
	Two Metal Rods, Metal Twine, Gnomish Bolts.</p>
    <p>A fine set of plate boots to - yes - keep your feet warm.  Designed
	for the those who could normally wear plate and yet have small feet,
	these boots offer AC 10 and a boon of +5 cold resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gnomish Vanishing Device</strong></font><br>
Trivial at ??, cost ?? pp</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Diamond, Small Lantern, Steel Wire, Gnomish Bolts, Reflective
	Shard, Haze Panther Eye, Class Five Mana Battery.</p>
    <p>Expensive to make, at the very least.  The charges (however
	many there are, presumably of Invisibility of some kind) can be
	restored by replacing the mana battery.</p>
