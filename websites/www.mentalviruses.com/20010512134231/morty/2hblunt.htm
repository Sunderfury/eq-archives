</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>Delivering the big crush</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>The great staff and its magical variations are the only
two-handed blunt weapons we can use, with the one important
exception noted below. No great surprise in that, and there's a
certain satisfaction in whacking something upside the knee (hey,
we're gnomes, what do you expect?) with a big stick.</em></p>

<p><em>The benefit of the two-handed staff is damage - with few
exceptions, a great staff will do noticeably more damage in a
single hit than a similar one-handed staff, and about twice as
much damage as a comparable dagger. The price you pay for this
extra damage is speed, with the two-handed staff being slower
than the one-handed, and almost twice as slow as a dagger. As a
result, you're going to be doing about the same amount of raw
damage with any type of weapon you choose of the same quality.</em></p>

<p><em>An important (if obvious) point is that with a two-handed
weapon, you don't have a free hand to hold anything else, such as
something that increases your abilities. At low levels, you
probably won't have one of these items, so it's not a big deal;
at higher levels, it's something to consider.</em></p>

<p><em>The various forms of the great staff are the main weapons
in this category.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Worn Great Staff</strong></font><br>
6 damage, 40 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The starter version, found on monsters all over Norrath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Warped Great Staff</strong></font><br>
7 damage, 40 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Harder to find than the standard worn great staff, and it
    doesn't doo all that much more damage... but anything called
    &quot;warped&quot; deserves some room in your closet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Great Staff</strong></font><br>
9 damage, 38 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The standard variety, it hits hard. What more do you want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Fine Steel Great Staff</strong></font><br>
9 damage, 36 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The improved version, also found on monsters all over
    Norrath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Combine Great Staff</strong></font><br>
9 damage, 36 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Back in the old days <em>[hack, spit]</em> they knew how
    to make a real staff, and this is it. Simple in design,
    effective in use, and capable of hitting creatures that
    another great staff won't touch. Expensive as all get-out as
    far as staves go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>If you know a Magician who will do you a favor, you can
get a decent magical weapon that sheds a little light for the
cost of a single spellcasting. Just remember that all of these
conjured weapons will disappear from your hands when you camp.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Tracing</strong></font><br>
7 damage, 40 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is the first staff that can be conjured up by a
    Magician, so most of them pick up the 8th level spell that
    does the trick. In addition to being a decent staff, it holds
    charges of Flare and provides a nice amount of flickering
    light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Warding</strong></font><br>
8 damage, 38 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Conjured up by a Magician with the 16th level summoning
    spell, this staff provides light and holds charges of Gaze.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Runes</strong></font><br>
9 damage, 36 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A Magician can summon this with the 24th level spell. It
    provides light and holds a quick charge of Cancel Magic.
    Darned handy at times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Symbols</strong></font><br>
10 damage, 34 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>At 34th level, a Magician can pick up this spell and
    summon away. This glowing magical stick also holds charges of
    See Invisible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Mystery<br>
</strong></font>11 damage, 32 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>All right, I'm making this one up. But admit it, there's a
    pattern going on here. A 44th level Magician really ought to
    have a spell to summon a staff like this, maybe with some
    charges of Bind Sight. If I were a Magician <em>[shudder]</em>
    I'd be poking around looking for those high-level summonings.</p>

<p><em>The more exotic examples of the great staff are noticeably
harder to acquire, but any gnome with Incredible Necromantic Power
shouldn't have too much trouble if you don't get in over your
head.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Runed Totem Staff</strong></font><br>
9 damage, 37 delay, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The mystical powers of the Runed Totem Staff grant a boon
    of +5 mana and +5 health, and no Necromancer in their right
    mind would argue with that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Treant Staff</strong></font><br>
10 damage, 35 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you're like me - and I know I am - you don't have a
    very good relationship with treants. So what could be more
    satisfying than taking a hunk of dead treant and cracking a
    few kneecaps? With the staff throwing Root on your target now
    and then, you can't go wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Discord</strong></font><br>
10 damage, 40 delay, Magic, No Drop</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Topped with a grinning skull, it just reeks of necromancy.
    You know you want one. Good point: It weighs less than most
    daggers. Bad point: It can't be dropped or traded. Guess who
    you have to kill to get one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Undead Legions</strong></font><br>
20 damage, 47 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Designed exclusively for the necromancer, this evil
    artifact allows the wielder to Beguile Undead. Only the most
    impressive of Necromancers should even think about picking
    one up.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>It's in a class all by itself. It looks good. And it
answers that all-important question: Where did you get all of
those bones?</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shovel</strong></font><br>
4 damage, 27 delay</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>You'll have to pry it out of the cold, clammy hands of a
    dead farmer, but any Necromancer will undoubtedly put it to a
    better use than digging turnips. Besides, every gnome should
    have one. Gnomes invented digging. Note that this is NOT the
    shovel dropped by magicians, which isn't a weapon.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Walk softly and carry a big stick. Don't forget to hit
people with it.&quot;</p>
