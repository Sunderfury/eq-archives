<p>When wading into the bload-soaked field of battle, you may
wish to deliver a little death personally rather than simply rely
on your Incredible Necromantic Power. While the Necromancer is
certainly limited in the selection of weapons, there are a number
of items of exceptional interest that are well worth the trouble
to acquire.</p>

<p>These lists are not complete, for the wise Necromancer is
always finding new ways to deal death.</p>

<p>In complete honesty, these lists are also fairly out of date.</p>

<p>As with anyone who has dedicated their life to spellcasting,
the armor selections of the Necromancer are more limited than
most. Cloth armor and apprentice robes will be your comfort for a
long time... but if you want to strike terror into the hearts of
any who behold you, you'll need to pick up some better threads.</p>

<p>These lists are not complete, nor are they intended to be;
they serve only to offer information on particular items that may
inspire the Necromancer to further effort.</p>

<p>These lists are also very, very out of date.  I'll do something
about that at some point.</p>

<p>Many gnomes, regardless of their primary calling, spend a
great deal of time puttering around with mechanical objects. The
gnome Necromancer is no exception, seeing in this yet another
opportunity to work with things that, while not actually dead,
are certainly not alive.</p>
