the Dark Arts<br>
</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>for Necromancers of 16
Levels</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Banshee Aura<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 60 mana requiring 1 pearl</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Surrounds the Necromancer with a shield that damages
    attackers when struck by a melee hit.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Damage shields are wonderful things.
    You only need to have one pearl in your inventory, it is not
    used up when you cast the spell. The effect doesn't last very
    long, so you'll want to cast it right before you step into
    combat. The damage done increases at higher levels. You'll
    also want to cast it any time that you just want to look
    impressive - it's a nice effect.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Cancel Magic<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 30 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Removes a magical effect from the target.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is useful for taking down an
    opponent's damage shield, or getting that lingering damage
    spell to go away. It's also nice to have on hand when your
    Shadow Knight friend gets charmed and is smacking the living
    daylight out of you.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Cure Disease<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 20 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Removes a lingering disease from the target.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Make them beg for it. Have them shout
    praises to Bertoxxulous. Get some coins. Whatever. Just don't
    let them think you go around curing diseases for the fun of
    it. We have a sinister reputation to uphold here.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Feign Death<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 60 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Brings the Necromancer to a catatonic state which is
    indistinguishable from death, causing attackers to lose
    interest.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Or at least that's the theory. While
    you might always fall down, you might not always be taken for
    dead - in which case, you may as well be. But the first time
    that your pet brings a giant to you, and you fall over and it
    goes along its merry way without squashing you like a bug,
    you really start to appreciate what a wonderful thing Feign
    Death really is.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Heart Flutter<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 80 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Lowers the target's strength, reduces their armor class,
    and drains their health over time.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Another line of damage over time
    spells, and it stacks with both the Darkness and the Blood
    lines (and probably Poison as well). Stacking all three of
    these on a target is nasty, cruel and mean. I love it. This
    gives you some serious damaging ability, and the debilitating
    effect should make your pet's attacks more effective.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Hungry Earth<br>
</strong></font>being an Alteration of 30 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Holds the target undead immobile and strikes them for a
    fair amount of damage.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Or as the saying goes, &quot;May the
    road rise up to eat you.&quot;</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Infectious Cloud<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 78 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Enemies near the target are afflicted with disease,
    preventing them from healing, and doing a fair amount of
    damage over time in the process.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The damage is comparable to Heart
    Flutter, so don't hesitate to use it against a single target
    - with multiple targets, this is one of the best
    damage-for-mana spells you've got.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Restless Bones<br>
</strong></font>being a Conjuration of 160 mana requiring 2 bone
chips</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Summons an undead skeleton to do the Necromancer's
    bidding.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This doesn't seem to be available in
    Necromancer guilds, but a trip to your local Shadow Knight
    guild should do the trick.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shielding<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 50 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Provides the caster with increased maximum health, an
    armor class bonus, and increased Magic Resistance.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The next in the series, and like
    always, well worth your time and money.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shieldskin<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 41 mana requiring 1 cat's
eye agate</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Absorbs damage before it can affect the Necromancer until
    its limit is reached or magical damage is taken.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>It seems like any spell hit will take
    this down, making it less than entirely worthwhile in a lot
    of situations. You can also go through a lot of agates. I
    tend to only use this for special occasions, but on those
    occasions it's really a lifesaver. This is the first spell of
    a series.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Spirit Armor<br>
</strong></font>being an Abjuration of 75 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Provides the target with an armor class bonus.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This is another buff that you can share
    with your comrades and your pet. We get this spell before the
    clerics do.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Voice Graft<br>
</strong></font>being a Divination of 10 mana</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Allows the Necromancer to speak through the mouth of the
    pet.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Fun. Silly, useless, and flawed, but
    fun.</em></font></p>
