<p><em>When a fellow guild member asked me for a biography, I
decided to share with him one of the turning points of my life. I
thought it only fair that I would share this with you as well.</em></p>

<p><em>Take heed.</em></p>

<p>During his childhood years, Morty spent a great deal of time
chasing tiny little bats through the caverns of Ak'Anon, or
playing with the friendly clockworks. When he was feeling
particularly adventurous, he would sneak out into the Steamfont
Mountains to visit his father, a Watchman who guarded the path.</p>

<p>One rainy day, a pack of howling wolves emerged from the mist
and surrounded the poor Watchman. Little Morty could only watch
as the beasts tore into his father. The suffering was brief. Just
as Morty turned away to flee, the wolves shifted into elven and
halfling forms.</p>

<p>Terrified, Morty ran back to the safety of Ak'Anon, hiding
himself deep in the Mines of Malfunction. Cowering in the
darkness, he heard a ghostly voice whispering words of comfort -
and words of vengeance. Other spectral voices soon joined
together in a chorus of bitterness and rage, weaving a dark song
of bloody stone and burning wood.</p>

<p>The dead were tired of resting in peace.</p>

<p>&quot;I just go where the voices tell me to go.&quot;</p>
