<hr>

<p><em>As the Necromancer grows in power and wisdom, many
questions must be answered. Some of those questions are
philosophical by their very nature; many of those questions
involve death. The question that tends to come up time and time
again, though, is this: &quot;What should I kill next? And where
can I find it?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>I won't say that these are the best places for a
Necromancer to hunt, but they worked for me to a greater or
lesser degree. Some of my memories are a bit blurry, but things
should be much clearer from here on.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 1</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>My rampage of death began in Steamfont, like nearly all
    other gnome Necromancers. Since killing gnome skeletons
    results in a falling out of favor with the Dark Reflection, I
    left those alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 2</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I was still killing things in Steamfont, there being no
    particular reason to move on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 3</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I remained in Steamfont, taking down a slightly wider
    variety of things. I had a short period of freelancing in the
    Mines of Malfunction, but I found that to be troublesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 4</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>And there I was, still in Steamfont. I wandered around
    more of the area, seeking kobolds and avoiding pumas. With my
    newly-acquired Gate spell, I ventured out into the world to
    test my increased necromantic power. Lesser Faydark was
    interesting in a panic-stricken sort of way. Greater Faydark
    appeared to be much more interesting - until I ran into my
    first elf guard. I had no idea how unpopular I would be
    there. Stupid elves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 5</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Steamfont was the easiest place to be, as I was still
    intimidated by all of those wandering elf guards in Faydark.
    I hunted quite a lot of kobolds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 6</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Still, I was in Steamfont. Would I never be able to leave
    this place? The pickings were slim, but somehow I managed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 7</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>With little to hunt in Steamfont, I braved the elf guards
    and made my way to the Butcherblock Mountains. This proved to
    be full of worthy opponents, and I was quite pleased - until,
    with a shocking sense of deja vu, I got a bit too close to my
    first dwarf guard. Upsetting, but corpse recovery was now
    routine, and at least the dwarven guards were too lazy to
    wander around. By keeping my wits about me, I was able to do
    quite well both in the Butcherblocks and, more rarely, in
    Greater Faydark at the entrance to Crushbone. <em>[Note:
    Leave the Crushbone orcs alone. Killing them lowers an
    important faction in Neriak, and having access to the dark
    elf city later in life is extremely useful.]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 8</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Freedom! With Gather Shadows, I was now able to elude the
    elven and dwarven guards with ease. I took the cruise to
    Freeport and discovered that, while I wasn't precisely loved
    in that city, I certainly wasn't hated. The merchants were
    tolerable, and the local Necromancers were competent, even
    though they do not have the wisdom to follow Bertoxxulous and
    so must eventually be slain and used to populate the undead
    armies that will sweep across the world and... well, that's
    later. Based in Freeport, I hunted the East Commonlands and
    the Northern Desert of Ro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 9</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hunting was still good in the East Commonlands and
    Northern Ro, but I had heard stories about a Shrine of
    Bertoxxulous in the west, and so I started my pilgrimage. The
    trip was long and perilous. Things were particularly bad in
    Highkeep Pass, where I discovered yet another set of guards
    to avoid, but I eventually found my way to Qeynos. The Shrine
    of Bertoxxulous is a grand and wondrous place, and in a way I
    truly pity all of those unbelievers who will only view its
    grandeur after they have been slaughtered and transformed
    into faithful servants. My pilgrimage fulfilled, I went on a
    killing spree in the Qeynos Hills and the Western Plains of
    Karana, wandering occasionally through the Qeynos Sewers for
    the sake of amusement. In the process, I made very careful
    notes regarding how painfully Holly Windstalker will die when
    I come into greater power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 10</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I continued hunting in West Karana, and also took an
    exploratory trip to Erudin, where I was resoundly ignored. I
    then headed back to the East Commonlands and Northern Ro. I
    also did some freelancing in the Nektulos Forest, where I
    discovered that the roaming halflings were about as friendly
    to me as the elves and the dwarves. This time, however, I was
    in no way surprised, nor was I alone. Halflings make good
    snacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 11</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I continued my necromantic rampage in the East and West
    Commonlands, with the occasional trek into Northern Ro. It
    was fast and furious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 12</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Commonlands were becoming routine, and it was time for
    a change. Now that I was able to Bind Affinity, I headed back
    across the Ocean of Tears and returned to Steamfont. It was
    like old times, only better. The heretic dead that used to
    terrorize me were now just walking piles of bone chips, and
    the kobolds were beneath my contempt. I spent a great deal of
    time near the windmills and in the minotaur cave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 13</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The pickings were too good to leave. I remained in
    Steamfont, slaughtering minotaurs, harpies, elementals, and
    anything else that got in my way. The living was good, but
    the killing was better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 14</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Steamfont suddenly being much less challenging, I once
    again turned westward. Lesser Faydark had camps of suitable
    enemies, but companions were few and far between and so I
    continued on. I visited Dagnor's Cauldron, having never been
    there before, and did find opponents worth my time; however,
    they were found only infrequently, and far tougher foes than
    I wished to confront were also plentiful. I did not tarry. I
    returned to Antonica to hunt in the West Commonlands, taking
    care to avoid the druid ring. I also spent some time
    exploring the first two floors of Befallen - quite the
    endearing place, I may choose to retire there in my advancing
    years - but the depths were beyond my skills, and so I must
    return at a later time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 15</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Although I could feel Befallen calling to me, I avoided it
    like the... well, I avoided it. I took some time to tread the
    outskirts of Lavastorm, but I did not find the weather to my
    liking (although I must make it a point to visit Najena
    later). Lured by the promise of good fishing spots, I spent a
    quite a lot of time in the Oasis of Marr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 16</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I spent a bit more time in the Oasis of Marr, and then
    took a grand tour. I chose to learn the elements of Research
    from my home guild in Ak'Anon, but the Book of Dark Bindings
    was mysteriously unavailable there. I consoled myself by
    purchasing a couple of books on tinkering and a few of my new
    spells. I knew that the Shrine of Bertoxxulous would have my
    research tome available, and so off I went again, taking a
    short detour through the Beholder Maze along the way. From
    the Shrine I headed for the Mountains of Rathe, where I
    stayed for a while.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 17</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Having grown fond of the mountains, I stayed in the area,
    occasionally heading to South Karana or Southern Ro for a
    change of scenery. If I had a recipe for basilisk tongue, I'd
    be rich.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 18</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Why was I still in the Mountains of Rathe? I hadn't been
    to a bank in... in... I couldn't even remember. I hustled
    through the Desert of Ro, pausing only to bury a few
    drybones, and made my way back to Freeport and the
    long-forgotten bank. Then, with my newly found wealth, I
    headed back to Steamfont and finally acquired some tinkering
    supplies and set about making myself a fishing pole. With my
    new fishing pole in hand, I then headed halfway across the
    world to meet some friends in the Beholder Maze for some
    wholesale destruction. And then, back to the Oasis of Marr
    for some massive orc carnage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 19</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Enjoying the warm desert clime, I remained in the Oasis of
    Marr for a while. Rumors of an undead army then took me to
    the Qeynos Hills, where I helped put the unrestful back in
    their place - I wanted to march them all to Surefall, but
    they just wouldn't listen. That being done, I headed over to
    East Karana to deal with reavers and stalkers, but I soon
    found myself at the undead ruins in West Karana, where a
    short bit of hunting was very profitable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 20</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Naturally, I headed straight for Qeynos to pick up my new
    spells - or at least the ones I could find. I then headed for
    South Karana to deal with the overgrowing aviak population.
    For variety I wandered into East Karana to deal with gorge
    hounds, dark stalkers, and the Mucktails. Attempts to hunt in
    North Karana generally turned out poorly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 21</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>It was time to return. I entered Befallen once more. I
    joined with a company of three, and we were able to hold our
    own in the basement, much to our pleasure. From there I
    wandered off to South Karana for aviak hunting, with
    occasional runs to East Karana for undead reavers, gorge
    hounds, and the occasional griffawn. Things were going slowly
    until I teamed up with a wizardly friend of mine and headed
    for the Ocean of Tears, where we reduced the isle goblin
    population.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 22</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I sailed straight into Freeport, headed for the
    Necromancer guild, and learned how to dodge. Ahhh, how nice. I
    decided to take a break from the brisk sea breezes and headed
    back to the Karanas for a spot of hunting, but the view there
    becomes monotonous. I trundled off to Najena for a while,
    where I picked up some amusing trinkets. Then it was back to
    the Karanas, tracking down the remains of the Splitpaw
    clan... then back to the Ocean of Tears to deal with
    pirates... back to the Karanas... and back to the Oasis of
    Marr. All in all, it took far too long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 23</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Oasis held little to interest me after my hunting
    companions departed, and so I went off to the Karanas. South
    Karana, although highly overpopulated, still provided
    reasonable hunting both groups and solo. East Karana was an
    excellent soloing ground - most of the wandering nasties were
    weak and left me alone, and the stronger ones provided me
    with a good hunting experience. With my bony companion I was
    able to take down Broon, which was some well-deserved
    payback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 24</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Ahhh, the power! The power! I could scarcely contain my
    necromantic glee after I picked up my new spells at the
    Shrine of Bertoxxulous. South Karana was still overpopulated
    but full of prime targets, and so hunting commenced. I then
    teamed up with a few guildmates and headed for the Rathe
    Mountains, where we took down any giant skeleton or cyclops
    that we could find. Absolute bloody carnage. Ha!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 25</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Since I was in the neighborhood, I killed a few more of
    the South Karana aviaks before wandering off. I followed a
    few friends into Everfrost, and after carefully avoiding the
    ignorant barbarians (oh, their time will come, I assure you!)
    we dealt with a particular tribe of snowy orcs. Then I spent
    a bit of time in the Estate of Unrest, which tended to be
    either exciting or terrifying, and paid another visit to
    Najena.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 26</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I was feeling restless, but not particularly adventurous.
    I stuck to places I was familiar with: South Karana, the
    Ocean of Tears, and the Estate of Unrest. Coincidentally,
    these happened to be places where I could collect the pieces
    for the Harvester of Shadows, which I then acquired from
    those nice folks who follow Solusek Ro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 27</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I was having a hard time staying focused, and my hunting
    was limited to short periods of time. As a result, I spent
    almost all of my time alone in South Karana. Just me, my bony
    companion, and 50 rabid druids at any given point in time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 28</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The new clan in Paw is tougher than the old one, but with
    some friends I was able to get in a little deeper for some
    more satisfactory bloodshed and destruction. I later paid a
    visit to some Erudites in Lake Rathetear, who were not
    terribly friendly. I then wandered all about Norrath
    collecting the bits and pieces required for shadowbound
    armor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 29</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>More power! Mua ha ha! Suddenly, killing became much
    easier. I completed my set of shadowbound armor, and then
    headed back to the Rathe Mountains. With friends there, we
    brought down whatever cyclops or giant would cross our path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>It was at this point in time that passage was secured to
the previously lost continent of Kunark, where gnomish curiosity
took over.</em></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>So much to explore... After arriving at the shipyards, I
    spent a short bit of time hunting in the Overthere, but most
    opponents were either too difficult or not worth my time. I
    moved on, and did a great deal of wandering (but not much
    hunting) in Warsliks Woods and the Field of Bone. While I was
    wandering the Woods, and after several disagreements with
    iksar bandits, I came upon a cavern system that the bandits
    must call home. I killed them. My underground trek led me
    directly to the depths of the goblin mines in the Lake of Ill
    Omen, which I proceeded to haunt with a vengeance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 30</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>After securing my place in goblin folk tales, I headed
    back into the sunlit lands surrounding the Lake of Ill Omen.
	A trip into the sarnak fortress proved quite interesting, as
	did a short bit of hunting with a few friends in the Frontier
	Mountains.  I then wandered about, killing things here and
	there, finally finding myself in the Rathe Mountains once
	again.  When a few friends joined me, a simple evening of
	hunting turned into a slaughter-anything-bigger-than-an-ogre
	killing spree, which was both profitable and fun.  We also
	discovered that, despite her words to the contrary, Cynthia's
	comrades really don't like her much at all and will do little
	to avenge her death.</p>

	<p>I also made a special trip to the Qeynos Hills to visit my
	dear friend, Holly Windstalker.  Ahhh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 31</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Rathe Mountains remained enjoyable and continued to fill
	my pockets with coin.  There was much bloodshed.  When I ran low
	on bone chips, I wandered over to the undead shrines in the Feerott.
	Quite satisfying, and it seems like the time just flew by.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 32</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I could have stayed in the mountains for quite a while, but my
	gnomish wanderlust took over.  I hopped on a raft and made myself
	comfortable in the Overthere once again.  Hunting was quite a bit
	more successful than my original attempts there, and I was able to
	refine my necromantic skills both alone and in the occasional group.
	I also began proving myself to the dull-witted minions of Venril
	Sather, for what that will be worth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 33</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A few more kills in the Overthere provided some entertainment before
	I joined a few guildmates in the Frontier Mountains.  Why do mountains
	seem to provide the best carnage?  I then took a side trip to the area
	near Firiona Vie, but that wasn't nearly as satisfying - there's a smell
	there that just bothers me.  Too many elves, perhaps.  So back to the
	mountains it was, first the Frontier Mountains, and then the Rathe
	Mountains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 34</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Feeling the call of greater power, I took a short break from the
	Rathe Mountains carnage to visit the necromantic guilds in Neriak and
	Freeport to pick up more necromantic rites.  I went quickly back to the
	carnage, of course.  The Overthere kept me busy, with occasional visits
	to nearby areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>It was at this point in time that my gnomish brethren finally
broke through the Iceclad Ocean, clearing the path to Velious.  Naturally,
my gnomish curiosity took over once again.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 35</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>After all this time, I've finally discovered where I truly belong.  Yes,
	I was meant to be a pirate.  Yarrr!  After getting to know my long-lost
	compatriots, I helped keep their camp secure by eliminating some of the
	local threats.  A brief excursion into the Tower of Frozen Shadow left me
	with a desire to explore it even further, but I was called away to the Great
	Divide for a grand hunting expedition.  Many things died, most of them taller
	than myself.  A wizardly friend of mine then whisked us away to Kunark, where
	we visited the Mines of Nurga.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 36</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Since I was in the neighborhood, I headed back to the Overthere for some
	quick carnage.  The quick carnage became massive carnage.  It was good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 37</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I wandered away from the Overthere to join a few friends not far from
	the eyesore that is Firiona Vie.  Despite that persistent elf smell, we managed
	to distract ourselves with drolvargs, frogloks, and leeches.  After a bit, my
	friends left.  I was on a roll, so I stayed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 38</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I picked off a few more frogloks, and then realized that I hadn't seen the inside
	of a bank for a while.  Back to the Overthere I went with my overfull bags.
	Naturally, I killed a few things on the way in.  Then I killed a few more things
	on the way out.  Then I joined up with a few trolls and dark elves and killed quite
	a lot more.  It was a necromantic picnic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 39</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Getting my priorities in order, I took a break from the slaughter to chat with an
	ogre in the Overthere and bribe him for my latest summoning of the undead.  I then found
	my way back to Ak'Anon and the Mines of Malfunction to acquire the rest of my new
	dark rituals.  But where to give things a try?  Out of curiousity, I headed into the
	depths of RunnyEye, not for any serious killing, but to verify the rumors of the goblin
	bankers - true!  I then headed off to the Temple of Droga to see if they had a banker
	as well.  They do not, although I had to kill rather a lot of them to find out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 40</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I refused to believe that such a large goblin tribe had no bank, so I interrogated
		a few more goblins in Droga. Again, the results were inconclusive. I wandered off
		and killed, well, a lot of other things, but this puzzling goblin enigma wouldn't
		leave my mind. I went back and questioned more goblins about their monetary habits,
		just to be sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 41</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>My search for goblin bankers pulled me from the Temple of Droga to the nearby
	Mines of Nurga, where further interrogations revealed no signs of banking
	whatsoever. On the invitation of a friend, I headed off to the Ocean of Tears for a bit
	of island hunting, but again, I couldn't stop thinking about those Kunark goblins. Convincing
	myself that I had simply overlooked something, I headed back to Nurga.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 42</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Back in the Mines of Nurga, I made another thorough investigation of the area and
	put quite a few of the more experienced goblins under pressure to answer my questions.
	They were stubborn, but I continued my questioning until one of them suggested I go
	deeper in the cave. (Those weren't his exact words, but I'm sure that's what he meant.)
	Plunging further in brought me to a large spider nest, and I could hear burynai in the
	distance. This explained things; there must have been a bank and other amenities
	such as the goblins are familiar with, but the areas were overrun by these pests. I tried
	interrogating a few spiders to verify my theory. I thought they were being even more stubborn
	than the goblins, but then I remembered &#150; spiders can't talk. Silly me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 43</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Having come up with a reasonable explanation for the lack of goblin banking facilities,
	I headed back to the Overthere and the only Kunark bank I'm familiar with. On the way in,
	I could barely walk 20 paces before stumbling over another sarnak. It seemed clear to me
	that there were too many of these things, so I promptly set about killing the sarnak hoards.
	It was an enjoyable sort of work, not unlike tending a graveyard on a chill autumn evening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 44</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Suddenly, I realized that I had advanced to a new circle of spells. I went off to visit my
	guild in Ak'Anon, tinkered for a bit, and then returned to Kunark. I had heard rumors that the
	Dreadlands were crawling with unpleasant beasts, and so I made my way there. The rumors were true,
	and finding some like-minded fellows up for a bit of slaughter wasn't difficult. Before too long,
	though, a questing friend requested my company in the Burning Woods. Off I went. We engaged in the
	sort of mad, nonstop killing spree that I prefer, but did not find what we were looking for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 45</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Following up on a tip provided to me by a fellow necromancer, I made my way to the
	Crypt of Dalnir. The legends concerning the Visceral Dagger proved to be true, much to
	my pleasure. Leaving the Crypt, I wandered back to the Dreadlands, with the occasional
	excursion back into Nurga to exterminate some spiders. Why are mines so hard to keep clean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 46</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I realized that I'd spent a great deal of time lately underground. While that's all fine and
		good, I thought a bit of fresh air would be a nice change. I spent a little more time in
		the Dreadlands, and then went back to Velious for a bit of giant-killing. The brisk winds
		and the snow, accompanied by the sound of toppling giants, were just what I needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 47</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I was having quite a good time with the giants, but the opportunity arose to join
		up with some of my friends in the Crimson Legacy and pay a visit to Chardok. It was
		quite educational, despite that unique smell that only sarnak seem to have. Afterwards,
		I returned to the conveniently-close Dreadlands for a while, only to have yet another
		opportunity come up &#150; an assault on the Plane of Fear, again led by the Crimson
		Legacy. It was death on a grand scale, and quite enjoyable all around. Back in Norrath,
		I indulged in some simpler killing in Trakanon's Teeth and, yes, the Dreadlands again.
		During this time, I was also gathering reagents in the first steps of an epic
		necromantic quest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 48</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I killed a few more Dreadlands denizens, then wandered to the Burning Woods for a
	picnic before returning to civilization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>While my back was turned, some meddling wizard opened up a portal to the moon. The moon,
of all places! Gnomish curiosity grabbed me by the head and dragged me away.</em></p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Wandering about on Luclin proved less than entirely fruitful. While the sights were
	certainly interesting, my time was mostly spent in the Grimling Forest and the Tenebrous
	Mountains. I also spent some time conversing with a fellow necromancer in the Echo
	Caverns, who shared some useful necromantic spells I'd not seen previously. With that,
	I returned to Norrath to plague the residents of the Lesser Faydark before coming full
	circle back to the Dreadlands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Level 49</strong></font></p>

	<p>At the first opportune moment, I returned to Ak'Anon and purchased the last spells
		that the Dark Reflection would sell me; I have learned all that they have to teach.
		With those additions to my spellbook, I traveled to Luclin to glean what knowledge I

		surprisingly casual way, I returned to Kunark and murdered most of the inhabitants of
		the Dreadlands.</p>
