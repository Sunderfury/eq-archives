<p align="right"><font size="5"><em><strong>Armor<br>
</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>Protecting the physical</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>While it's true that the robe is the defining armor of the
Necromancer, protecting the rest of the body is certainly
important. As the higher levels of necromantic power are
approached, though, physical protection will tend to give way to
magical enhancement, making jewelry and other such items more
appealing.</em></p>

<p><em>The various types of standard armor cover most parts of
the body in the form of chokers, tunics, gloves, and so on.
Larger items such as tunics and leggings provide more armor than
smaller pieces like bracers and gloves. Better materials can
provide more armor, less weight, or both.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Cloth Armor</strong></font><br>
AC 1 to 4</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Standard cloth armor offers the least amount of
    protection, but it's very light. Even cloth armor is better
    than nothing.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Cloth armor can be found on quite a few
    of the uglies that run around Norrath. Your best bet is your
    local orc clan, gnoll family, or goblin tribe.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Netted Armor</strong></font><br>
AC 1 to 4, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Although it offers the same amount of protection as cloth
    armor, netted armor is magical in nature. Although this has
    no known effects on a Necromancer's combat abilities, I'm
    sure that you'll sleep better at night knowing that, if you
    took the time to Sense Magic, your armor would show up
    positive.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Netted armor is a bit harder to find,
    but I've seen it on lizardmen and frogloks.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Raw Silk Armor</strong></font><br>
AC 2 to 6</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's quite a bit more comfortable than that rough netted
    stuff, and it offers more protection. Promote your local
    tailors and be sure to offer a fair price to encourage them
    to greater efforts - the more time they spend sewing, the
    less they're in your way when you're trying to do some
    serious death-dealing.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Any tailor who finds patchwork armor
    trivial should be able to throw together some silk armor for
    you. Getting the silk may be more time-consuming, however.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Woven Armor</strong></font><br>
AC 2 to 6, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This lightweight armor offers better protection than cloth
    or netted and is magical in nature. It's comfortable armor,
    if you can get that froggy smell out of it.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>The frogloks seem to know more about
    magical cloth than anyone else. Natural weavers, perhaps?</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Damask Armor</strong></font><br>
AC 2 to 6, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Damask offers similar protection to woven armor, but was
    designed with the spellcaster in mind. Damask robes appear a
    dull off-white.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>To get some nice damask pieces of your
    own, you'll probably have to pull it off the body of a dead
    spellcaster. Look for it wherever a group of spellcasters
    have made a permanent home.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gossimer Armor</strong></font><br>
AC 3 to 8, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Gossimer offers superior protection for approximately the
    weight of cloth. The robes show up as very white.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>You'll find gossimer armor in many of
    the same places as you'd find damask, but it tends to be
    reserved for the elite in any group.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Shadowbound Armor<br>
</strong></font>AC 5 to 9, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Talk to the right people, and you can set yourself up with
    two or three pieces of shadowbound armor. It will involve
    quite a bit of travel, but the reward is well worth the time
    involved.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>Sometime after the Necromancer has
    mastered, say, the eighth circle of spells, this armor can be
    successfully sought. One must prove one's worth, however, to
    a certain Temple inhabitant. You certainly won't find it just
    lying around.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Cryosilk Armor</strong></font><br>
AC 3 to 11, Magic, No Drop</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The different pieces of cryosilk armor are imbued with
    many enchantments, providing a wide variety of boons for the
    wearer. Only the most powerful of Necromancers are capable of
    obtaining it.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This otherworldly armor is greatly
    desired by all of the spellcasting classes, and requires a
    trip to the Plane of Fear to obtain. Good luck.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Blighted Armor<br>
</strong></font>AC 4 to 11, Magic, No Drop</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Purely necromantic, and the best of its kind.</p>
    <p><font size="2"><em>This armor is available in the Plane of
    Hate, but since only Necromancers can wear it, you won't be
    arm wrestling the Magician for it.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>Bone armor is shunned by many spellcasters due to its
weight. This is certainly understandable, as the stuff ranges
from reasonably light to somewhat heavy... but what could be more
appropriate for a Necromancer than raw bone? You might not be
able to move, but at least you'll look menacing.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Sheer Bone Mask</strong></font><br>
AC 3, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This mask has more necromantic style than anything else
    you'd care to attach to your face, and also grants the wearer
    a boon of +3 intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Chipped Bone Collar</strong></font><br>
AC 4, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The magical nature of this neckpiece grants the wearer a
    boon of +10 health and +10 mana. It no doubt used to be
    glowing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Glowing Bone Collar</strong></font><br>
AC 5, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This neckpiece will grant the wearer a boon of +25 health
    and +25 mana. Try not to chip it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bone Armplates</strong></font><br>
AC 5, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The power imbedded in these bulky sleeves grant the wearer
    a boon of +5 strength, but also impose a penalty of -4
    dexterity. The added strength is just enough to balance out
    the weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Hollowed Bone Bracers</strong></font><br>
AC 6, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Lighter than the armplates but still full of bony badness,
    these magical sleeves grant the wearer a boon of +7 magic
    resistance and +15 mana.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Chipped Bone Bracelet</strong></font><br>
AC 4, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Dangling from a wrist, this bracelet will grant the wearer
    a boon of +5 wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Polished Bone Bracelet</strong></font><br>
AC 2, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>These bracelets are lightweight, stylish, and grant the
    wearer a boon of +3 wisdom and +3 intelligence, making them
    highly sought after by spellcasters of all persuasions. Only
    Necromancers really deserve them, though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bone-Clasped Girdle</strong></font><br>
AC 4, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This evil artifact, when worn, will grant the wearer a
    boon of +7 strength, +7 dexterity, +7 stamina, +75 health,
    and +75 mana. Extremely difficult to obtain, but it gives the
    Necromancer a challenging goal if the desire is to be as
    bone-clad as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bone Legplates</strong></font><br>
AC 6, Magical</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>These heavy, grim leggings grant the wearer a boon of +5
    strength, but also carry a penalty of -4 agility.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>Sure, bone armor is nice, but it takes a long time and a
lot of Incredible Necromantic Power to gather it. In the
meantime, how about some choice rat items? Guaranteed to gag most
elves, there's nothing like rat armor to get across the message,
&quot;I like to play with dead things.&quot;</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Rat Fur Cap</strong></font><br>
AC 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's fuzzy and it fits. What more do you want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Rat Pelt Cape</strong></font><br>
AC 1</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Furry and warm, this sleek ratty garment grants the wearer
    a boon of +2 cold resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Rat's Foot Necklace</strong></font><br>
AC 0</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>More of a good luck charm than any kind of armor, this
    little trinket grants the wearer a boon of +2 health. It
    disturbs most people, though, so there is also a penalty of
    -1 charisma. Laugh at their foibles. Wear it anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>After you've killed a few kinds of crocodiles, you start
to get ideas. Someone with a bit of magical power got a couple of
very specific ideas. If only we could get some luggage...</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gatorscale Sleeves</strong></font><br>
AC 6, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In addition to great arm protection, these sleeves grant
    the wearer a boon of +4 intelligence and +15 health.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Gatorscale Leggings</strong></font><br>
AC 7, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another fine 'gator product, these tough leggings grant
    the wearer a boon of +4 wisdom and +15 health.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><em>There are many, many pieces of armor available to the
Necromancer. Here are a few that are particularly suited to a
practitioner of the dark arts.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Batfang Headband</strong></font><br>
AC 2, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We don't talk about it much, but Ak'Anon has a healthy bat
    population - not the huge bats like you see in the Faydark,
    but those little things that get through small cracks and fly
    around you when you sleep. A lot of gnomes think that's a
    problem, but I've always liked them. Why, I remember when I
    was just a wee little lad, and I'd chase the bats through...
    well, ask me about it if you want the full story. The design
    of this headpiece reminds of those little batlings. Aside
    from the nostalgic charm, this grants the wearer a boon of +3
    wisdom and +3 intelligence, making it exceptionally nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dark Circlet</strong></font><br>
AC 4, Magic, Lore, No Trade</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Designed exclusively for the discriminating Necromancer,
    this evil piece of work sits nicely on a gnome's head
    (although other Necromancers can also make it fit). The
    circlet grants the wearer a boon of +4 intelligence and +10
    health, but imposes a penalty of -2 charisma.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Nightshade Wreath</strong></font><br>
AC 1, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Take a poisonous plant and wrap it around your head - it
    sounds silly, but it also has a certain amount of style. The
    resulting headgear grants the wearer a boon of +5 wisdom and
    +5 intelligence. This is what happens when powerful druids
    get drunk and start making things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Collar of Undead Protection</strong></font><br>
AC 5, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes they turn on you. Sometime they just don't
    listen. Sometimes the dark powers play a little joke on you.
    Whatever the reason, you're going to end up with an angry
    undead horror in your face sooner or later, and any extra
    protection is nice. In addition to being decent armor in and
    of itself, this neckpiece grants the wearer a boon of +7
    poison resistance and +7 magic resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dusty Bloodstained Gloves</strong></font><br>
AC 2, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>While every Necromancer no doubt has a pair of dusty
    bloodstained gloves, these gloves in particular are magical
    in nature and grant the wearer a boon of +25 mana... which
    makes me wonder what kind of blood is responsible for the
    stains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Cloak of Shadows</strong></font><br>
AC 12, Magic, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>You can barely tell that it's there, but it's as
    protective as the cover of night. This mystical item offers
    the possessor impressive protection as well as a boon of +13
    dexterity and +10 disease resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Festering Cloak</strong></font><br>
AC 5, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Only a Necromancer would actually wear this, which works
    out well since only an actual Necromancer is capable of
    wearing it. The wearer is granted a boon of +10 health and
    +10 mana, but suffers a penalty of -10 disease resistance and
    -10 poison resistance. Embrace the gifts of Bertoxxulous.</p>
