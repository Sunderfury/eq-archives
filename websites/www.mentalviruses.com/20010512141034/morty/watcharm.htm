</strong></em></font><font size="4"><em>Tinkered protection for
the gnomish elite</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p><em>The recipes for Watchman armor were recently revealed
by the gnomish pirates based on Velious. Only the most skilled
tinkers will likely have a chance at constructing this armor,
and many of the components are difficult to acquire.  It will
also be very, very expensive.</em></p>

<p><em>While I expect that this armor will not be available to
Necromancers, it will prove useful for our trusted living companions
who join us in our conquest of the known world.</em></p>

<p><em>I have yet to see any of this armor, so the details are
rather fuzzy.  According to the construction manual, any pieces
that have charges can be recharged by replacing the mana
battery.</em></p>

	Gnomish Vanishing Device, Class Five Mana Battery, Metal
	Fastening, Metal Twine, Gnomish Bolts.</p>
    <p>One would expect that the built-in vanishing device would
	continue to function once incorporated into the breastplate.</p>

    <p>More obscure armor.  Make two, they're small.</p>
