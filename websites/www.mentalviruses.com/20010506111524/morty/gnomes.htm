<p>Gnomes, more than any other race in Norrath, are particularly
well-suited to the dark path of the Necromancer. There are many
things that contribute to this, from the inherent characteristics
of the gnomish people to the more subtle social relationships
that are not often commented upon. </p>

<p>Success in combat, effectiveness of spells, and generally
getting along with life are all strongly influenced by the level
of one skill or another. Improving these skills is an important
key to longevity. Like most adventurers, the Necromancer has a
wide array of skills to work on, but some are much more important
than others.</p>

<p>If you missed the introductions, I'm Morty, your host. While I
don't consider myself a &quot;typical&quot; gnome Necromancer, I
do believe I'm a reasonable example of such. With that in mind, I
present a quick look at myself for those who just don't get out
much.</p>
