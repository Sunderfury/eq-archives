<p><em>So you've got a backpack full of tasty delights that
you've whipped up after the battle, and you're not hungry. Not to
worry! Take a look at your companions and hand out some treats.
They may or may not thank you, but at least they'll remember you.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Ogres</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I've never met an ogre that didn't love a Rat Sandwich, or
    anything else with rat in it - Beer Braised Rat, Rat Kabobs,
    and Rat Ear Pie are all big hits. If you really want to
    impress them, though, serve up some Hot n' Spicy Toelings as
    appetizers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Trolls</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Trolls tend to eat a lot like ogres, and also have a
    certain fondness for prepared rat dishes. Most trolls grew up
    with Pickled Froglok, too, so being able to share some with
    them is like a trip down memory lane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Paladins</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you really must offer food to a Paladin rather than
    letting them starve, let them feast on their own fallen. What
    better way to say &quot;bite me&quot; than by handing over
    some Dwarf Chops or Elven Veal as appropriate? Your best
    option, though, is to hit up a vendor and get yourself a nice
    supply of Paladin Pickles for those special occasions. Snack
    on them yourself, and share them when you can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Druids</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Any druids you run into aren't going to be asking for
    food, since they'll eat any weird shrub they trip over. As a
    result, you'll need to take it upon yourself to offer them
    things. I usually start with a Wolf Sandwich, and then move
    on to Wolf Steaks. They usually refuse. Naturally, I keep
    going, moving on to Bear Steaks and Beer Braised Bear. It's
    important to be persistent in these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Necromancers</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Necromancers eat Druids. Set yourselves down to a picnic
    of Smoked Wood Elf, pull out the Hot n' Spicy Toelings that
    you hid from the ogres, and chow down. Grab some Bixie
    Crunchies for desert. Enjoy living at the top of the food
    chain.</p>
