<p><em>There are more items in the world reserved specifically
for the Necromancer than there used to be, and they're well worth
stacking up a pile of dead bodies to pick up. A determined
Necromancer could eventually acquire all of these things and
equip them simultaneously, for a total effect of +11
intelligence, +4 agility, -2 charisma, +20 health, +25 mana, +4
fire resistance, +4 cold resistance, -10 disease resistance, and
-10 poison resistance. I've excluded otherworldly items from the
list here - if you're picking up things like that, you don't need
me telling you how good it is to be a Necromancer.</em></p>

<p><em>Necromantic weapons are slow-hitting things, but offer
useful magics.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dagger of Marnek</strong></font><br>
3 damage, 30 delay, Lore</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The dark power invested in this dagger grants the wielder
    a boon of +3 intelligence and +15 mana. This dagger is
    intended for ritual, not combat - it's slow, hits for little
    damage, and does not hit for magical damage. However, it can
    be usefully kept on hand by putting it where you'd place a
    throwing dagger. Just be careful not to throw it, of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Staff of Undead Legions</strong></font><br>
20 damage, 47 delay, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This evil artifact allows the wielder to Beguile Undead,
    or just whack them upside the head for a great deal of
    damage. Only the greatest of Necromancers will be able to
    acquire one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Armor that is reserved for the Necromancer tends to be...
special.</em></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dark Circlet</strong></font><br>
AC 4, Magic, Lore, No Trade</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This evil piece of work sits nicely on a gnome's head
    (although other Necromancers can also make it fit). The
    circlet grants the wearer a boon of +4 intelligence and +10
    health, but imposes a penalty of -2 charisma.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Festering Cloak</strong></font><br>
AC 5, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Only a Necromancer would actually wear this - convenient,
    that. The wearer is granted a boon of +10 health and +10
    mana, but suffers a penalty of -10 disease resistance and -10
    poison resistance. Embrace the gifts of Bertoxxulous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Robe of Enshroudment</strong></font><br>
AC 9, Magic</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's just so black, it's perfect. Beyond the blackness, it
    grants the wearer a boon of +4 intelligence, +4 agility, +4
    fire resistance, and +4 cold resistance. The important thing,
    though, is that it's black.</p>
