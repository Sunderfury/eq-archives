<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I have a question about the charm animal line of spells.  First of all I admit I am not an expert, I go by what I think is right and try to find the best way to combine my spells to be effective when soloing or in a group. Here goes.

I never really bothered trying to get the first spell befriend animal. I saw a fellow druid use it, but he didn't seem too successful utilizing the spell.  I thought it was neat and went and bought the spell.  But again never used it for about a week afterwards.  I was in a group with my Shaman(one of my dozen characters) and we had an enchanter in the group charming Cutthroat Dervishes and using them to slay their own kind.  I though, "woah cool!" so I have used it to solo in the Oasis with crocs.  Of course the befriend animal didn't work well unless used on a mid to low blue or green.  No biggie it was useful and allowed me to nuke and melee without doing a full mana burn using kiting(which I hate cause even medding i hate waiting for mana regeneration).  But it pretty much became more of a humor thing.  Apparently this spell line isn't used often cause practically everytime i used it to fight caimans versus dw caimans people would run up and say things like, "Never saw that before," or, "Wonder how that happenned?" not knowing that it was me. Someone even called me weird but he was getting flamed most of the evening in the zone so I assume he was either a jerk or stupid. Once while fighting a rather powerful aviak in South Karana i saw an elephant wonder by and turned, befriended and had it helping for some really nice goring damage, and I heard a party member go, "WTF!?!"  It is useful and really funny when you hear an elephant, "Yes master sitting down now." or something.

Anywho my questions are as follow.  First are the higher level charm spells that much better(which takes a larger mana usage) than befriend animal?  And the second question is this :

I know that a few casters can summon pets, if they are soloing they take an exp cut because they are using the pet(like losing half the exp from what I hear).  Is this the same for Druids eventhough they aren't summoning a pet, there is no basis of it being a summoned creature?  It is a non-summoned creature that I have taken control of and made my pet. Make sense?

I know that in a group it wouldn't matter anyways at least based off of what I read on the main everquest site.  I love grouping myself.  I don't get as much exp per kill, but if you have a good enough group, the incoming monsters can be so quick that it is practically a nonstop battle and exp kill after another and just plain fun laying waste to hordes of evil and looking at the floor littered with the dead.  As opposed to soloing, blowing your mana, maybe taking a few shots and then sitting forever to be full power, with makes for a pretty boring night. 

Sorry to just carry on, but any info on the questions would be highly appreciated.
