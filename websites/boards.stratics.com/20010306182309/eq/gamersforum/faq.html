          Tolerance&quot; Policy</b><br>
          The EQSS Gamers Forum has a &quot;No Tolerance&quot; policy when it 
          comes to these forums. Any messages found to contain obscene or otherwise 
          abusive information will be removed from the site. Our goal is to provide 
          a service where mature and cooperative message sharing is possible. 
          Personal attacks, flames, or harrasment against others will not be tolerated 
          and may result in banning of the said individual(s) from these forums.</font> 
        </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="register"><b>Registering</b></a> 
          <br>
          Registration is only required if you plan to post new topics or reply 
          to existing topics. Registration is free, and you are not required to 
          post your real name. You are required to post your actual email address, 
          however. </font> </font></p>
        <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="smilies"><b>Smilies</b></a> 
          <br>
          You've probably seen others use smilies before in email messages or 
          other bulletin board posts. Smilies are keyboard characters used to 
          convey an emotion, such as a smile :) or a frown :(. This bulletin board 
          automatically converts certain smilies to a graphical representation. 
          For example, if you type :o in your BB post, it will automatically be 
          converted to <img src="redface.gif" width=15 height=15 border=0 alt="">- 
          a shameful face. The following smilies are currently supported: </font>

        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="html"><b>Using HTML 
          and/or UBB Code</b></a> <br>
          You may be able to use HTML and/or UBB Code in your posts, if your administrators 
          and moderators have those options turned on for each forum. Some forums 
          may have either HTML or UBB Code turned off, or both turned off. Only 
          your bulletin board's leaders can set this. Every time you post a new 
          note, you will be told whether UBB Code and/or HTML is enabled for that 
          particular forum. If HTML is on, you may use any HTML tags, but please 
          be very careful that you use proper HTML syntax. If you do not, your 
          moderator or administrator may have to edit your post. UBB Code is similar 
          to HTML, but offers just a few basic functions, such as hyperlinking, 
          image display, bolding and italicizing. A complete list of current UBB 
          Codes are <a href="ubbcode.html">listed here</a>. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="mods"><b>Moderators</b></a> 
          <br>
          Moderators control individual forums. They can edit, delete, or prune 
          any posts in their forums. If you have a question about a particular 
          forum, you should direct it to your forum moderator. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="profile"><b>Changing 
          Your Profile</b></a> <br>
          You may easily change any info stored in your registration profile, 
          using the "profile" link located near the top of each page. Simply identify 
          yourself by typing your username and password and all of your profile 
          information will appear on screen. You may change any items, except 
          your username. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="prefs"><b>Customizing 
          Using Preferences</b></a> <br>
          As a registered bulletin board user, you may store your username and 
          password in memory for up to one year at a time. This will prevent you 
          from having to type your user name and password every time you post 
          a note. You also have the option of changing the default number of days 
          back to view topics. Just click on the "prefs" link and you can make 
          either of these settings. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="cookies"><b>Cookies</b></a> 
          <br>
          This bulletin board uses cookies to store the following information: 
          the last time you logged in, your username and password, and your preferred 
          "topic view", if you set it in preferences. These cookies are stored 
          on your browser. No cookies are used to track your movement or perform 
          any other function other than enhance your use of the bulletin board. 
          If your browser does not support cookies, or you have not enabled cookies 
          on your browser, many of these time-saving features will not work properly. 
          </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="edit"><b>Editing Your 
          Posts</b></a> <br>
          You may edit your own posts at any time. Just go to the thread where 
          the post to be edited is located and you will see an edit icon on the 
          line that begins "posted on..." Click on this icon and edit the post. 
          No one else can edit your post, except for the forum moderator or the 
          bulletin board administrator. A note is generated at the bottom of each 
          post that is edited so that every one knows when a post has been edited. 
          </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="signature"><b>Adding 
          Signatures</b></a> <br>
          You may use a signature (commonly used in email messages) on your posts. 
          This is a new feature, so if you registered previously, you may not 
          have been queried about storing a signature, but if you click on the 
          profile link at the top of most bulletin board pages, you will be able 
          to edit your profile, including your standard signature. Once you have 
          a signature stored, you can choose to include it any post you make by 
          checking the "include signature" box when you create your post. This 
          bulletin board's administrator may elect to turn the signature feature 
          off at any time, however. If that is the case, the "include signature" 
          option will not appear when you post a note, even if you have stored 
          a signature. You may also change your signature at any time by changing 
          your profile. </font>
        <p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"> Note: You may not use HTML in 
          your signature file, but you may use <a href="ubbcode.html">UBB Code</a> 
          (except for the UBB Code Image tag). </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="attach"><b>Attaching 
          Files</b></a> <br>
          For security reasons, you may not attach files to any posts. You may 
          cut and paste text into your post, however, or use HTML and/or UBB Code 
          (if enabled) to provide hyperlinks to outside documents. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="search"><b>Searching 
          For Specific Posts</b></a> <br>
          You may search for specific posts based on a word or words found in 
          the posts, user name, date, and particular forum(s). Just click on the 
          "search" link at the top of most pages. Note: announcements are not 
          included in the search returns. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="announce"><b>Announcements</b></a> 
          <br>
          Announcements are one-way communications from either a forum moderator 
          or a bulletin board administrator. No one may post replies to these 
          announcements. If you want to talk about specific announcements, you 
          will have to create a new topic in the appropriate forum. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="censor"><b>Censoring 
          Posts</b></a> <br>
          The bulletin board administrators have the power to censor certain words 
          that may be posted. This censoring is not an exact science, however, 
          so certain words may be censored out of context. Please realize that 
          the censoring, if any censoring is being performed, is being done by 
          a computer based on the words that are being screened. Words that are 
          censored are replaced with asterisks. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="pw"><b>Lost User Name 
          and/or Password</b></a> <br>
          Retrieving your username and password is simple, assuming that email 
          features are turned on for this bulletin board. All of the pages that 
          require you to identify yourself with your username and password carry 
          a "lost password" link that you can use to have your username and password 
          emailed instantly to your email address of record. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="notify"><b>Email Notification</b></a> 
          <br>
          If you create a new topic, you have the option of receiving an email 
          notification every time someone posts a reply to your topic. Just check 
          the email notification box on the "New Topic" forum when you create 
          your new topic, if you want to use this feature. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="activetopic"><b>What 
          is the Daily Active Topic List?</b></a> <br>
          When you visit this bulletin board, you will see a link at the top of 
          the list of forums called "Daily Active Topic List". Clicking on this 
          will provide you with all topic in all open forums that have been posted 
          to that day. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><a name="searchprivate"><b>Can 
          I search private forums?</b></a> <br>
          Currently, only administrators and moderators can search through private 
          forums. We do plan to support seaching of private forums for other authorized 
          users in the future. </font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><A NAME="archives"><B>What are archives?</B></A><BR>
          Archives are read-only areas that contains topics that were previously posted 
          to one of our forums.  You may not add a reply to a topic that is in an archive. 
          Topics in an archive may have been completely removed from the original forum 
          where they were started, or they may still exist in their forums.<P></font>
        <p> <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica"><A NAME="icons"><B>What are icons?</B></A><BR>
          Depending on the configuration of your forums, you may be able to associate an
          icon with each post that you make. There are currently 14 icons, each expressing
          a different emotion or identification. These icons range from a simple note
          to sadness to warning. These icons appear next to each topic in a forum
          listing and on each post. If you do not see icons, your forum administrator
          may not be allowing icons on this particular forum.
