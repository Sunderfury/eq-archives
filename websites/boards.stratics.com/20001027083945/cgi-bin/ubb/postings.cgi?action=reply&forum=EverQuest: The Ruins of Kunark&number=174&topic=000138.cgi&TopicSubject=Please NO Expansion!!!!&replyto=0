<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Murkdale:
[B]I really hope Verant doesn't release an expansion anytime in the near future. There is just no way the servers could handle it. I mean look at it now, a good majority of the time it is unplayable on the weekends. Imagine when the server volume increases by 25% all the time when an expansion is released. That may be a conservative estimate. The numbers jump 25% when there is just a GM event scheduled. I guess the performance isn't that critical as long as we continue to renew our subscriptions. If I were running the EQ servers and I made just as much money spending $150K a month as I made spending $210K (I have no idea of the real figures. I am just giving an example.) I would continue spending as little as I could to maximize profit. Don't get me wrong EQ is a fantastic game when it works. It just seems to me that it is working less and less every week. I remember when I was thinking, "Geez, 7% lag. This is ridiculous!!". Now I am happy if we can stay around 25% lag. I have run the same setup since beginning EQ so I don’t believe the lag is related to my hardware (PII 350, 96MB RAM, cable modem). I have tried playing on several different servers, but the difference in performance is marginal. I guess to sum it up, I wish we could focus on the problem at hand, instead of focussing on game mechanics and expansions. I would prefer to play a character that has a few buggy spells, rather than not being able to play at all.[/B][/QUOTE]

We now have over 50000 people trying to get logged in on one server. They should really consider adding an additiional login sever, or even splitting the chat server to another machine from the login server. This would reduce a lot of the bumps you get from the character select screen, and free up the largest bottleneck in the game.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Goroth</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">What I think Verant should do is this.  First; make 2 chat/login servers, and 1 dedicated login server...this would greatly reduce the amount of people.  Think about it...just let you choose which one.  Also; maybe you can set a defult server to log into, and if it is down it will tell you.<P>Next...make all new copies only playable on new servers.  This way people won't crowd onto the old ones.  I didn't play until a month after, but they should release at least around the number of servers they had now.

Or someone that has. I hear that each zone has a different server? Is that a fact or something someone has assumed because there is a loading please wait message when you zone?<P>I would love to know what the current config of their login server is! For all we know it could be anything. It could be 3 or 4 load balanced servers (I doubt it but it is possible) Or it could be a TSR80 Color Computer. <P>Basically if it isn't a few load balanced servers I would suggest they do something similar to that.
