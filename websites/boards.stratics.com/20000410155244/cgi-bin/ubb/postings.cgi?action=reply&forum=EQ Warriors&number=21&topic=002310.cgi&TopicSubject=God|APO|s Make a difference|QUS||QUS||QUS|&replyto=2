It is like playing two different char’s. <P>Ok here is what I thought the advantages would be to being agnostic. One better chance of raising faction with all of Norrath (this is True). Two Not have to worry about a god (Well this is not a problem). I never thought there would be advantage to having a God so I thought it was just a look I am following Rallos Zek thing (False Major False)<P>So what do I give up by Following Zek which I really had no idea until I played a Agnostic. (Since the Rallos Zek  was the char I made the day the game came out). LOL what a Shock to find out I was playing to most hated God Racial Combo in the game. Hell even the ogre’s in Neriak where KOS to me. My own Guild warriors Guild in Neriak hated me and would not talk to me. Yes I could get by in Neriak But man I have to be really careful. In Grobb I Hated by the warriors the Shamans and the SK’s only the vendors will talk to me in fact the SK’s will KOS. All this is different with the Agnostic I can travel safely in these places and easily raise faction for the other cities. I have yet to ever get enough faction to go into any city other than the three evils which I am partially KOS there also. <P>So what did I gain I figured Nothing I Lost I did not gain. But wait I was trying to do some comparison on some weapons and I was jumping back and forth between the two chars. I spent 5 days and my numbers where not staying steady driving me nuts. Then I tried just sticking with one of them and I Started finding out I wanted to know. Then made me think Wait a sec is there truly a difference in char because of God’s (no way I never heard of anything.) well I did the same test with the other ogre and low and behold there was a major difference the Rallos Zek. Warrior was hitting Harder max damage more often and his average hit number was higher I thought well there is 2 level difference between the two but the Numbers are a lot more than 2 levels would ever make up am I on something here or am I going Nut’s.<BR><P>------------------<BR>WARDUH<BR>OGRE WARROIR<BR>ME SMASH ME BASH <BR>ME KILL ALL</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Kupa</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">Personally... I hope you are going nuts... Kailyn will probably shoot someone if he reads this post...<P>If the god you worship matters for melee damage and strength doesn't... I don't even wanna consider it.<P>Though isn't Rallos Zek the god of conflict/war/etc? I suppose he could give you insights that an agnostic warrior would not have... the idea that they would implement this while letting a gnome hit for as much as an ogre with the same weapon boggles my poor barbarian mind...<P>------------------<BR>Kupa FrostHeart<BR>38th Barbarian Warrior<BR>Fennin Ro<p>[This message has been edited by Kupa (edited February 03, 2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">PackMan97</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica">I don't know what log parser you have been using..but there is no way a gnome hits for as much as an Ogre.
