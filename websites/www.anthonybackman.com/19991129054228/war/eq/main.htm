<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>I realize you want to get right to the pictures but let me plug what I'm trying to do with this page and then feel free to click away.</P>
<P>As the weeks go by in Everquest many are getting to the point where more than 1 - 6 member group is required to accomplish the objectives at hand. I would like to begin to document these greater tasks and note the tactics that work so that very tight teams can be formed. In a perfect world we can begin to see organized 10-12 groups of 6 operating in a state of order and precision.</P>
<P>Though I am in no state to lead a group of this magnitude the most productive thing I feel I can offer up to those in a position to tackle the big bad boys is to document recon and coordinate intelligence on the activities of these raids. In the process I hope to share some good strategy and maybe even broaden some minds in art of war.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ffffff"><P>Due to the support the dedicated fans of Everquest have given this site and the objectives it pursues I shall be expanding the site to include all major objectives of all levels in the world of Norath. I will continue to hone in an the ultimate group tactics for upper levels but at the same time revisit the operations that are challenging to players who are striving to rise to the larger challenges of the world.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"><P>NOTICE: This is a reference site. If you are looking for a site that is updated with facts of the day and/or discussions on patches you will not find it here. If you are looking for that verity of information please consult the links section below to direct you to an adequately staffed EQ site that specializes in this type of minutia. If you are looking to join in discussions on tactics and/or want information on what observations have been made on group tactics and mission objectives then you have come to the right place.</P>
<P>When I personally become level 46 look for a major change in this structure as I will want to build teams and will take the initiative to set up raids that I have enough intelligence on to as insure the victory of the party. Although I am on Tarew Marr I want this to be a repository for all expeditions on all servers knowledge of these events. Failure is not an option, loss of life is a variable that shall be worked out.</P>
