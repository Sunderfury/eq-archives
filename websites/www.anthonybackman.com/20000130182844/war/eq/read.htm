<P>By Sun Tzu </P>
<P>This may seem pretentious to some, but until you've actually read it don't think I'm putting this up to be a smart ass. There is a reason that this collection has survived the test of time, Sun Tzu knows his $#!T. Since reading this book I have found many parallels between his philosophy and gaming tactics, in multiple player on-line environments, real time strategy, and even business and interpersonal relationships. If I can get to it I'll out line the chapters and how they apply to EQ but until then READ THIS BOOK. (I personally don't heed the editors notes because if I wanted to here about what he though about war I'd read HIS book)</P>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>This man is my hero. Take a kid who was told he was a bastard, give him the education of one of the worlds greatest philosophers (Aristotle), add a ton of ambition, charisma, humor, and a thirst for conquest and then you BEGIN to fill out what this man became. No one else can claim to conquer the world and every know civilization in one fell swoop.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Diplomatic, savage, blood thirsty and mean on a horse. One of the archotypical stories of a man bringing his people together rallying under a common goal and then whipping the snot out of anyone who would dare stand in his way. If you didn't fear the Great Khan you most likely found yourself without a head. All you "barbarians" out there could take a few lessons from the master and learn who put the BRUTE in brutal.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>For all the ladies out there I saved Joan for last. In less than three years this young woman reclaimed France from England. A feat that took both male dominated kingdoms 100 years to muck up. She claimed that it was the voice of God that commanded her, and from the results of her prophecy who can be the judge? She is a symbol of what conviction and righteousness can achieve in the hands of the pure of heart.</P>
