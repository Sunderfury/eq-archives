<FONT FACE="Arial,Times New Roman"><P>This is an excerpt from William Shakespeare's "Henry V".</P>
<P>Really read it, the words, the meaning, the ideal. If read correctly this speech can bring grown men to tears.</P>
<P>Westmoreland, an Englishmen, is a bit peeved because the French have about 10x the army for a battle that will occur the next day. The French are making a big show about how badly they are going to pummel the massively out numbered English. Against outrageous odds, ol' Hal has this to say to put things into perspective:</P>

<P>WESTMORELAND </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>O that we now had here</P>
<P>But one ten thousand of those men in England</P>
<P>That do no work today!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>KING HENRY V </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What's he that wishes so?</P>
<P>My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:</P>
<P>If we are mark'd to die, we are now</P>
<P>To do our country loss; and if to live,</P>
<P>The fewer men, the greater share of honour.</P>
<P>God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.</P>
<P>By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,</P>
<P>Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;</P>
<P>It yearns me not if men my garments wear;</P>
<P>Such outward things dwell not in my desires:</P>
<P>But if it be a sin to covet honour,</P>
<P>I am the most offending soul alive.</P>
<P>No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:</P>
<P>God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour</P>
<P>As one man more, methinks, would share from me</P>
<P>For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!</P>
<P>Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,</P>
<P>That he which hath no stomach to this fight,</P>
<P>Let him depart; his passport shall be made</P>
<P>And crowns for convoy put into his purse:</P>
<P>We would not die in that man's company</P>
<P>That fears his fellowship to die with us.</P>
<P>This day is called the feast of Crispian:</P>
<P>He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,</P>
<P>Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,</P>
<P>And rouse him at the name of Crispian.</P>
<P>He that shall live this day, and see old age,</P>
<P>Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,</P>
<P>And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'</P>
<P>Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.</P>
<P>And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'</P>
<P>Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,</P>
<P>But he'll remember with advantages</P>
<P>What feats he did that day: then shall our names.</P>
<P>Familiar in his mouth as household words</P>
<P>Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,</P>
<P>Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,</P>
<P>Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.</P>
<P>This story shall the good man teach his son;</P>
<P>And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,</P>
<P>From this day to the ending of the world,</P>
<P>But we in it shall be remember'd;</P>
<P>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;</P>
<P>For he today that sheds his blood with me</P>
<P>Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,</P>
<P>This day shall gentle his condition:</P>
<P>And gentlemen in England now a-bed</P>
<P>Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,</P>
<P>And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks</P>
<P>That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Times New Roman"><P>It is said that King Henry V's army went out that day to kill over 10,00 and capture 1,500 French while his loss was less than 30.</P>
