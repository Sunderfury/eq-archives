<P>Ok folks, I don't have much to go on here but what correspondence I do have I'm putting down for the record to save some lives and crack this bastard of a nut.</P>
<P>Above is a very crude map of the zone, don't laugh I am by no stretch of the imagination, a cartographer. I did not list cardinal directions because I'm not 100% of them myself. I think that the top is north, left west, right east, down south. The only imperial data I can give is that the clouds moved from right to left, as did the sun, and the moon went from bottom to top.</P>
<P>Here is the key for the numbers above:</P>
<OL>

<LI>The gate seen from Feerrott, I assume that this is where you port into but not having been there myself I can really tell you.</LI>
<LI>The temple (surrounded by a fire wall)</LI>
<LI>There are 2 sets of structures that are extremely tall and have a large flame on top of them. Each structure has a ramp on either side that leads you up to the top where the flame is.</LI>
<LI>There are 2 sets of huge bell towers. One is functional (the one on the left side), and one that is broken (right side)</LI>
<LI>An enormous hourglass that is almost smack dab in the center of the zone.</LI>
<LI>A huge bird statue carving. This same statue can be found in Lesser Faydark on the South East corner.</LI>
<LI>Each building labeled #7 is a cathedral like structure</LI>
<LI>This building is identical to the towers found all over Norath. It is tall with a triangular top with and entrance at the bottom. This same structure can be found in the desert of Ro, Rathe mountains, and most memorable as the specter tower in the Oasis.</LI>
<LI>This is a tall rectangular structure with an opening at the bottom. This same structure can be found in the Rathe mts.</LI>
<LI>The purple structures labeled #10 are open alter type structures. They are 4 poles with a slab of rock in the center of each</LI>
<LI>This is an area littered with runes and stones. There were so many that I couldn't possible show them all. Bellow this field is what appears to be a teleportation station. The type most commonly used by druids.</LI></OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The orange blocks are stone spires (the same variety that are found outside of Cazic Thule)</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Now that you have a general picture, and I do mean GENERAL, take a look at a clearing strategy that was posted on the EQ Vault message boards by Perdunk on Rodcet Nife. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Okay, this is the scoop that so many people have been</P>
<P>    waiting to hear. I can't tell you how many people ask</P>
<P>    me in game Perdunk just how do you do it. Well.. it is</P>
<P>    way to complex to explain in a tell or a say. And it</P>
<P>    is too dangerous just to try and show someone as it is</P>
<P>    going on. So let me see if I can accomplish the</P>
<P>    impossible and explain to everyone just what fear</P>
<P>    plane is all about. *Please dont try this at home</P>
<P>    -Smiles-*</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    First of all, lets try to describe the make of fear</P>
<P>    plane and how you must think of it as you are entering</P>
<P>    or walking about. There are numberous mobs in there</P>
<P>    and each pretty much has its own section of the zone.</P>
<P>    Each section is made up of roamers and stationary</P>
<P>    targets. For this writing im going break the zone down</P>
<P>    into 7 sections. Fear itself is basically one big</P>
<P>    square pied out into those 7 sections. Unless you</P>
<P>    spend hours apon hours in the zone you will probably</P>
<P>    only see parts of 3 secs while your puller might</P>
<P>    acutally spent a great deal of time in 5 section.</P>
<P>    There are 2 sections of the zone that are just</P>
<P>    extremely hard and more then like youll never get to</P>
<P>    (sorry druids, warrior, and Sks because the bulk of</P>
<P>    you drops are in these two hardest sections to get</P>
<P>    too).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    *okay time for everyone to switch their minds into a</P>
<P>    gemometric kind of view*</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    As you break in, the safest spot to start out at (and</P>
<P>    we will call this the SW corner or Camp 1) is Camp 1.</P>
<P>    This is absolutely the hardest single one thing for a</P>
<P>    group to do, that is getting the mass numbers you need</P>
<P>    to this spot so you can make your presence know. You</P>
<P>    see the gate in or portal is the apex of 3 of the</P>
<P>    section. Roamers from the first 3 sections like to</P>
<P>    meet up at the portal. So when you zone if your not</P>
<P>    careful, fast and have a head on your shoulders it is</P>
<P>    very possible that you attract mobs that roam from all</P>
<P>    three sections. Which isnt fun because once you do</P>
<P>    this you have effectively stired up the zone and make</P>
<P>    it twice as hard to get in. So people say you need to</P>
<P>    go in with invis, invis undead, and invis animals, but</P>
<P>    in my opinion this doesnt work at all if you make it</P>
<P>    to camp one that way its because you happen to have</P>
<P>    caught the mobs in there open spot as they roam to</P>
<P>    other locations in there repective section. You see</P>
<P>    when a mob roams it moves for about 30 secs then stops</P>
<P>    and looks around then decides to move again to there</P>
<P>    next nav point in their section (standing still time</P>
<P>    is about 30 secs also).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    The three sections that you deal with when you first</P>
<P>    zone is a long strech the goes from portal past the</P>
<P>    yellow scareling town through all the boggiemen to the</P>
<P>    back gorgon nest, then there is the portal section or</P>
<P>    about 5-6 mobs that acutally spend their whole life</P>
<P>    circling the portal (the meanist being the singlar</P>
<P>    scareling in that section), and last of the first</P>
<P>    three sections that you encounter is the section that</P>
<P>    goes from the portal past the Fited house back along</P>
<P>    the fire wall till you reach the section that houses</P>
<P>    Cazic himself. The mobs you will encounter that roam</P>
<P>    to toward the portal are Scarelings (huge argo radius</P>
<P>    1 in portal section 1-2 in boggie section, and 2-3 in</P>
<P>    section that leads to cazic), spine chiller spiders</P>
<P>    found in portal area and section to cazic, Shiverback</P>
<P>    apes found in portal area and section leading to</P>
<P>    cazic, Fited fiends found in all three areas,</P>
<P>    Amygladan warriors found in portal area and boggie</P>
<P>    section.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Okay now that you know the make up. Easiest way to</P>
<P>    make it to SW corner or camp 1 is to first try to take</P>
<P>    in a group of 12-18 that acutally know where this spot</P>
<P>    is so they can get there quickly. Then dont bum rush</P>
<P>    the spot with all 18 becuase you know people just</P>
<P>    arent made to walk in tight groups. Go one at a time</P>
<P>    where at all possible with other trying to let people</P>
<P>    behind them know how the gap in the 3 sections just</P>
<P>    are. Then zone in. One you have zoned in do a turn to</P>
<P>    you left head to the spot just next to portal and look</P>
<P>    down if you see nothing on hill to your right or left</P>
<P>    then run straight down til you hit zone wall. Once at</P>
<P>    zone wall you need to STOP LOOK AND LISTEN (this is</P>
<P>    very important to everyone in your group). If you see</P>
<P>    nothing coming at you (make sure you relize scarelings</P>
<P>    have a huge argo area and you might not see them on</P>
<P>    your tail at first) head slowly to camp 1 hugging the</P>
<P>    zone wall all the way there. Along the way there alway</P>
<P>    take a time out to make sure you are not draging</P>
<P>    anything with you. If you happen to pick up something</P>
<P>    along the way for god shakes dont run it to the Camp 1</P>
<P>    spot. Dont run off into the zone just gracefully sit</P>
<P>    there and try to gate out. If you cant just die right</P>
<P>    there and when you try to come back in again to get to</P>
<P>    camp 1 spot just corpse your body with you. If people</P>
<P>    do die it is very important that you tell them to</P>
<P>    FORGET about their corpse they will get it later as</P>
<P>    zone clears a bit. Last thing you need is people</P>
<P>    wandering around the zone once they are in and already</P>
<P>    at the camp 1 spot.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Okay you have assembled your army at camp 1 (what ever</P>
<P>    the numbers may be. the more people the better but i</P>
<P>    would suggest at least 18 people if you want to mark</P>
<P>    that spot as your permantly but you can pull it off</P>
<P>    with 12 people). Time to set up the camp 1 rules:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Rule #1 no one leaves the spot.. always keep your</P>
<P>    pulls as far up in the spot as possible and avoide</P>
<P>    runners</P>
<P>    Rule #2 if you get feared or teleported. Stand there</P>
<P>    like you were coming in for the first time and make</P>
<P>    sure you having picked up anything else if you have</P>
<P>    been fun having you in the group but you better die or</P>
<P>    gate out and we will let you know when its safe to try</P>
<P>    to come back in. Dont not run hrough out the zone you</P>
<P>    maybe with out your corpse till your puller things its</P>
<P>    okay for him to drag it back to you, which could be a</P>
<P>    long time.</P>
<P>    Rule #3 Dont bicker in OOC about who isnt or is in</P>
<P>    your group at the time or what the loot order is. most</P>
<P>    important thing right now is killing about 7-9 mobs so</P>
<P>    if you do die you can come back in safely. Just keep</P>
<P>    your mind on the killing machine and bicker in your</P>
<P>    repective groups till you are safely</P>
<P>    out of camp 1 when there is more time to have</P>
<P>    coversations because zone is about to be mastered.</P>
<P>    Rule #4 DO NOT succor or evac unless you absolutely</P>
<P>    have too because if you can take a couple of death or</P>
<P>    maybe even have the entire party wiped out but you get</P>
<P>    that extra mob that normally you wouldnt of because</P>
<P>    you succored it makes the take over of the zone alot</P>
<P>    easier because once again zone back in if you die is</P>
<P>    that much easier.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Now that the primary of the rules are made up and</P>
<P>    everyone is itching to get to bisness its time to</P>
<P>    pull. The puller should be someone that you trust and</P>
<P>    that you know if they will die before they bring back</P>
<P>    too much stuff to the group. This could be someone of</P>
<P>    any class. Although i prefer clerics over any other</P>
<P>    class because (opps i forgot to mention the Worry</P>
<P>    worts that are in section portal and boggie) if a frog</P>
<P>    jumps them they can DA (devine aura) so that on the</P>
<P>    way back with pull the frog cannt evoke fear them all</P>
<P>    over the zone. But im sure each person has their ideal</P>
<P>    of which class makes the best puller. And it really</P>
<P>    doesnt matter as long as the puller always acts with</P>
<P>    the group best interest over their own.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Okay now the puller jumps down from camp 1 and begins</P>
<P>    to look. Never pull anything from the sectioin leading</P>
<P>    back to boggies and imp tower. Imp tower is a bad</P>
<P>    thing because some times there is 4-5 imps sitting</P>
<P>    there having lunch. always try to pull singles from</P>
<P>    some where in between portal and and up to but not</P>
<P>    including the fited house in the section leading to</P>
<P>    cazic. Be patient you might have to wait for some</P>
<P>    stuff to come into that area but who are we kidding we</P>
<P>    arent in a marathon here we wanna clear and stay alive</P>
<P>    *smiles*.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Okay going forwar lets say you have now successfully</P>
<P>    killed about 9 mobs around the portal from parts of</P>
<P>    all three first sections. Now the puller uses his</P>
<P>    judgement to look around the portal area once you can</P>
<P>    detremine that there is no mobs between camp 1 and the</P>
<P>    fited area. Be patient again for the roamers to come</P>
<P>    to you and you should never move till you have at</P>
<P>    least killed about 9 mobs. Its time to move to a spot</P>
<P>    we call Camp 2 or THE TREE.</P>
<P>    The location of camp to is along the zone wall on your</P>
<P>    left as you look at the portal from camp 1. It is a</P>
<P>    big open area that can fit 30 or more people</P>
<P>    confortably for then next saga of your POF exprience.</P>
<P>    Infact you will more then like spend the rest of your</P>
<P>    time in POF at camp TWO.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    At this time you can elect to do 1 of 2 sections.</P>
<P>    *COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT boggie section at the moment</P>
<P>    (once again sorry druids and bards we will get to your</P>
<P>    stuff eventually).* You can either clear your way back</P>
<P>    to cazic and the cubes (there is another name for them</P>
<P>    but they look like huge cubes) or you can proceed to</P>
<P>    the next section or the section i call the dragon area</P>
<P>    (dracholice). If you pick back to cazic your are going</P>
<P>    make your mages happy if you pick dragon area youll</P>
<P>    make everyone but mages and bards happy. Normally</P>
<P>    becuase you get a lot of mage stuff at camp 1 i chose</P>
<P>    going to the dragon area becuase this area needs to be</P>
<P>    pretty dam clear before you think about going to the</P>
<P>    boggie area again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    In the dragon area thre really is only 2 spots to pull</P>
<P>    from. The best spot is the ruin thing that is right</P>
<P>    next to hour glass bridge. *first thing you must clear</P>
<P>    for this spot is the 2-3 tentcle terrors on the right</P>
<P>    side of hour glass bridge (merry xmas rangers). Then</P>
<P>    that pull spot is completely open to pull from.</P>
<P>    When you get so your standing in that spot just look</P>
<P>    back through the dragon area till you see the closest</P>
<P>    thing in spell cast range that is vertulally by itself</P>
<P>    so you continue with single pulls. You are not all</P>
<P>    ways going to get single pulls from there but i will</P>
<P>    tell you that you can out run Fiteds, warrios, knights</P>
<P>    so if you get alot of stuff coming at you just run and</P>
<P>    hope only the fastest stuff comes the other slow stuff</P>
<P>    will retrun to spot till you get close to that spot</P>
<P>    again (this is called auto pull and ill explain about</P>
<P>    that in a bit). Just keep pulling from that spot next</P>
<P>    to ruin till you no longer can see a mob in spell cast</P>
<P>    range. 2nd spot in this area is just ahead of you the</P>
<P>    hump at the bottom of the hill you cant see over (very</P>
<P>    dangerous spot, in fact this spot kills me so many</P>
<P>    time becuase before you can see whats over the hill 4</P>
<P>    frogs jump you and its all over *rememer da*) Another</P>
<P>    thing you have to watch out for while in dragon area</P>
<P>    is the dragon himself. Never pull from this area when</P>
<P>    dragon is up from because it will wander back to the</P>
<P>    back of hte area soon enough. This is when i take the</P>
<P>    time to switch between dragon area and section that</P>
<P>    leads to cazic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Once you have the large amout of dragon area cleared</P>
<P>    you can start on boggie area, finish the to cazic area</P>
<P>    or pull the dragon himself. I would advis that you</P>
<P>    fisrt clear the begining of boggie area and the major</P>
<P>    part of to cazic area before pulling the dragon so you</P>
<P>    dont get area feared into bringing more mobs back with</P>
<P>    you while fighting the dragon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Okay to start the pull in boggie area.. you are</P>
<P>    standing on the spot you started pulliing dragon area</P>
<P>    and you turn to your right you see a house. In this</P>
<P>    house is 3 mobs. They all will come and they will be</P>
<P>    either all boggie men or a mixture of boggie men and</P>
<P>    samhains. Careful you can out run all these mobs and</P>
<P>    you wil have to kind of stop go hand feed them your</P>
<P>    flesh on the way back to camp 2 for the pull. Once you</P>
<P>    have pulled the boggie house. ITs time for your group</P>
<P>    to med up full with their buffs becuase the imp tower</P>
<P>    is next. While attempting to pull the imp tower you</P>
<P>    just kind of try to get as close as possible without</P>
<P>    acutally hitting any of the imps you will usually get</P>
<P>    2-3 imps if you pray kill those and go back for the</P>
<P>    last 2-3 imps. Then the back side or boggie area is</P>
<P>    open for you to wander through and pull singles.</P>
<P>    Always remember the pathing in PoF is not just smack</P>
<P>    and run becuase mobs dont care how you get to where</P>
<P>    your going they will go on their own lil pathing area</P>
<P>    unless your are feeding flesh all the way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Once you have cleared PORTAL, TO CAZIC, DRAGON, and</P>
<P>    BOGGIE sections you can either move in closer with</P>
<P>    group to a spot of your choosing to the gorgon next in</P>
<P>    back or you can start to pull the CAZIC section</P>
<P>    himself. *CAZIC has a HT that will kill someone with</P>
<P>    2133 hps instantly so be careful when pulling from</P>
<P>    cazic area because his argo range is the largest of</P>
<P>    all mobs. Once you have gotten all the stuff from</P>
<P>    cazic area and cleared the back section or gorgan nest</P>
<P>    area you are ready for the 7th and hardest section.</P>
<P>    Remeber at all times you havent cleared cazic area</P>
<P>    because if you bring cazic you will bring the entire</P>
<P>    zone because he calls them all. 7th area is the temple</P>
<P>    behind the fire wall. Best thing to do to pull this</P>
<P>    area is to send someone with good magic resist through</P>
<P>    the fire wall near the fited house (camp 2). You will</P>
<P>    get HTed by all the knights in temple and cuasing a</P>
<P>    auto pull because i dont suggest you stick around but</P>
<P>    beat feat back to camp 2. Nothing will mostly come</P>
<P>    because you out ran them just start heading back</P>
<P>    to cazic along firewall youll see one and two</P>
<P>    knights/warriors coming most times till you clear the</P>
<P>    temple.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Now once you clear the zone ... good luck you are are</P>
<P>    ready for cazic. I say good luck because my server has</P>
<P>    yet to kill him and it will be along time before we do</P>
<P>    probably becuase by the time you get to this point you</P>
<P>    have been in fear for 12 hours and stuff is already</P>
<P>    respawning. AND OR people have come and gone and your</P>
<P>    numbers are depleted.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    *********** AUTO PULL*********</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Auto pull happens when you out run something back to</P>
<P>    pull spot or for what ever reason something that</P>
<P>    argoed you didnt follow you back off pull but returned</P>
<P>    to thier spots in thier section. Once this happens</P>
<P>    they transfer the argo flag to everything around them.</P>
<P>    So when you get into a range witch you willl have to</P>
<P>    determine through your own test, stuff just comes at</P>
<P>    you. Normally in ones or 2's depending on how deep you</P>
<P>    are.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    In closing i would like to say i also use my sould to</P>
<P>    pick up the dopplar effect the mobs are making so i</P>
<P>    can tell if there is a mob coming or going near me.</P>
<P>    And good luck to all servers i hope this helps.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    *** BE KIND TO YOUR PULLER*** it is not unlikely that</P>
<P>    they will die repeatedly in a matter of mins.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    Thanks all for your ears .. i may have skiped some</P>
<P>    stuff but it isnt easy to explain how to get through</P>
<P>    fear but i didnt attempt it for you. NOw you have</P>
<P>    something to go by .. use it or not just have fun. If</P>
<P>    you have any other questions about mechanics in PoF i</P>
<P>    will try and attempt to answer them.</P>
