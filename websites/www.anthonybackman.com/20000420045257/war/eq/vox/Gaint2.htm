<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;Here is where things got ugly. After crash #25 I awoke to this. 5 giants. See the 2 others in the hall? On top of this, Vox was not at all happy. I would say about 75% of the group was link dead when I came back. I did a zone list to find that where there were previously 85-100 there were now only 22 active in the zone. Needless to say, I bolted for the door.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Here we are regrouping after that fiasco. About 20 min of medding and rezing before we tried that again. It was about here that a group of lvl 50's started pleading for all lesser leveled characters to leave the zone to reduce lag. Most were kind in there requests, others were downright nasty. It was kind of sad, granted some were only there for the spectacle but I saw many folks this time around who were blue to me valiantly jump into the fight only to be told that their contributions were not welcome. This goes back to the whole poor server performance issue but personally I feel that if someone wants to give up there lives for a greater good then why not? For the safety of the others most below lvl 40 left at this point (I put on my press badge so as not to get yelled at).</P>
