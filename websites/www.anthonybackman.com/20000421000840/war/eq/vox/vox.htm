<FONT COLOR="#000080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;RETREAT!!! In the next pic you can see why I was cowering in fear for my life. This is the corner I mentioned earlier. Being hit 3-4 times with the ice breath I was in no shape to be prancing around the killing field lest I be one more corpse in the pile.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;Sitting in the corner waiting for the killing blow. I was hit either 3 or 4 times and when I checked I was down to 6 hp. For quite a while I though I actually was dead but for some strange reason thought no one cared to inform me. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;Here is the pic of my HP when I came to my senses to take a shot. I though you might find it amusing and informative. Divide my HP by 3 or 4 to get a sense of damage just for standing near the ice spell.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;ARCHER POWER! I maybe a dead man but I'll be dammed if I don't go down fighting!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">PS: I died right after this shot ;) </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The giant didn't kill me but Vox had broken free of the door and got the few inches she needed to freeze me out of the corner. I was able to stick it out back here for a good 5 min though.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;We all got spanked! After a rez. I took a shot when I got back on the killing field (killing for us, not them).</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">(Click the pic to hear the shout throughout the zone)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">More corpses. We mounted another try but it was more of the same. The rest for the info is dedicated to the wrath of Vox so you may know what to expect.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;After the first round of death I switched into my crises management mode and organized what I could to get things back up. For those who would have anything to do with me I tried to set up mana circles. This consisted of 4-5 clerics and a bard to a party with the bard playing the mana song and enchanters on the outside casting clarity on the clerics. Shamans and Druids were in reserve to heal the newly resed to save cleric mana. Spare clarity was cast on Shaman/Druids to accelerate their mana regen. Extra bards were doubled up on clerics to stack the mana song. Once again Clerics were the un-sung heroes of the day. Clerics, I love you!</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;Up on the ledge this time I was just out of reach for most of the ice breath damage. Here are 2 brave warriors who were lower lvl then me still volunteering for archer core in the back. NOTE: In a perfect world the archer Core would have summoned arrows as Vox is only effected by magic. BUT with all the crashes all the summoned arrows would have disappeared every 5 min.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;For recon here is a shot of Dragon Roar taking hold. Back here I was not feared and could hold my ground even though the spell icon showed up on my character screen.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;For reference look at my health bar to the left to see what 1 round of the ice spell did to me damage wise. On the right is my total HP count from earlier (1503 unmod with resists). You do the math... </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">After this shot was taken a few more events happened that may provide good info for you.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">All the tanks were dead so I threw caution to the wind an introduced myself to Vox's claws. As I got down to her I noticed that earth elementals were still doing remarkably well. This could be used as a possible buffer for retreating tanks to get healed in future attempts?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Once I got a line of sigh on Vox I let loose with a store bought arrow and got the message that she is invulnerable to non magic (DOE!). So then I got in her face. Well, maybe not face but I did give her toe nails a good clipping! That's when I noticed that she hit for 210 twice in a round... My AC was 664 so take that as you will.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">With one bubble of health left I ran to the back of the hall and hoped that I could just sit and wait it out. Well, you see, since I tagged her at least once she felt she had the right to summon me after about 2 min. of resting *gulp*. That was just about enough for my little heroics for the evening.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Add on top of all of this damage the fact that Vox likes to totally heal herself. In the course of the last fight I hear she did so 4 times.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">On the bright side, apparently SHE CAN BE SLAMMED OUT OF A SPELL! With a good core of large warriors bashing it is theoretically possible to keep her off her heals, frost and fears. I didn't witness this myself so take it with a grain of salt. </P>
<P>Thanks go out to the following people:</P>
<P>Snipee for hauling my first corpse out to be rezed. Could have ripped me off in consent but gained my trust as an honest fellow.</P>
<P>Daara for my first Rez.</P>
<P>Omnicide for hauling out my second corpse. Guildmate (AT) and brave Troll.</P>
<P>Halo for my second Rez.</P>
