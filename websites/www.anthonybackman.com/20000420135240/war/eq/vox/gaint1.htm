<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Here is the first round of combat, and as you can see no advantage is being taken on the superb structure of the staging area. It was very hard to document from this point forward because I would literally log in, see what was going on, set up for a shot, then go link dead. I'm not talking once or twice, I'm talking about every 30 seconds for upwards of about and hour and a half, no joke. If you ever want to be a part of a massive army experience in EQ then you best write an E-mail or feedback to Verant demanding that the robustness of the servers be addressed in the zones where activity like this will take place. In a perfect world every zone should be ready to handle 200+ players for any situation but personally I'd settle for working zones where they are needed to handle this type of traffic (Nagafen, Vox, Plain's). Until this push is made I'm sorry to report "community" in this game is limited to less than 60 players. Once we got to under 60 players I would only lock up every 5 min and only in heavy casting. I could rant more about this but I'll save it for the discussion boards.</P>
