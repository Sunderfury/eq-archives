<LI>The back ally for casters and the severely injured to rest. Note: if you do any damage to Vox and she runs out of things to kill next to her, she will summon you no matter where you are so this place is by no means a haven. Best case, you will avoid the ice breath back here unless Vox makes it into the main area (it can happen)</LI>
<LI>This is where I was able to retreat to after the first rounds of ice breath. This can be a safe spot if Vox is locked inside the doors. I was in the very corner of this area and saw people fall literally in front of my face so be very careful about running here. If you have the health go up and around to area #1. This should be reserved for those who have no chance of taking another hit from the ice breath.</LI>
<LI>First aid. We had a group of random healer types congregate here for wounded tanks to come out for emergency care. This seemed to help for about 3 additional volleys until Vox came out of the door and gained just enough ground to freeze the lot of them. It wasn't till later in the fight so if you can hold her back this may be a viable pit stop.</LI>
<LI>The Doors. This is where the puller will come from with all the nastiness that follows. Better shots of the doors can be seen in the next series of pics.</LI>
<LI>Escape. The jagged ice is the best route for getting the hell out of Dodge. This same spot is a great choke point for tanks, taunting off giants who have it in mind to crush any casters that may be on the ledge.</LI>
<LI>The ledge. Keep out for harms way up here if you are a caster or an archer.</LI>
<LI>On to the nasty stuff. I never went past this area so I'd be hard pressed to tell you what's back here. Due to feign pulling unless you are a Monk or Shadow Knight do everyone a favor and stay away from this area. Vox and pals would love to crunch anyone who can't take damage for 200+ times 2 a round then go aggressive on everyone near the doors.</LI></OL>

<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">This shot is taken from the very back looking into where the doors lead for the giants and Vox.</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="stage2.jpg" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480></P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;If you look at the map, this is looking to the section #5 from down by the cave opening. This is a key section for a few reasons: This is the only spot you can run out of any chaos that breaks out. All the other sections may appear to be low enough to jump out of but up the jagged ice is a sure thing. That being said, if casters are on the ledge above and happen to get a giant ticked at them then this is the choke point that the giants will have to run through to get to them. Not a bad idea to have a safety valve of tanks here. Also, if you are gripped by the fear of the dragons roar this is where you will be forced out.</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="stage3.jpg" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480></P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;I affectionately call this section "The Ledge". For reference, this is the spot #6 on the map. Strategically this is the most critical spot next to the killing field. Consider a few things: Below, on the slope of snow, properly placed healing types can spread out to reduce the impact of the overload of data when the fighting begins. Above, on the stone ledge, archers and heavy casters can perch themselves with impunity against the melee damage. The Ledge was so under utilized in this raid it is no surprised that once the fighting started everyone crashed, on the average, every 30 seconds.</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="stage4.jpg" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480></P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Looking into the cave. If you hook inside and hang a left, you will see the doors that lead to the giants and Vox. Dead ahead, you can barley make out the rock that is labeled #3 in the mini map. This whole area, from the opening of the cave, out to the ranger standing there, is the killing field. In a perfect world up to 4 giants can be pulled out here then separated into 4 groups and blasted and meleed to death. In this raid unfortunately all the melee was done right in the doors (not even seen here). Killing giants any place but out in this wide open killing field is a tremendous waste because only melee will get a clear shot on the mob thus reducing your fighting force drastically. Pull them out here, pull them apart, and your foes don't stand a chance. Also, using this killing field will cut down the chance of the data choking up your system (in theory).</P>

<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Another shot of the jagged ice around #5. The boulder on the right side of this shot makes for an excellent perch by the way.</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="stage6.jpg" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480></P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;Here I am on the perch I mentioned in the last shot looking toward #2. From this shot you can also see the top of "The Ledge". Don't be fooled you cannot jump up from the ground to the top of the ledge. This also gives a sense of perspective for the killing field.</P>
