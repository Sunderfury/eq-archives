<p><font size="+1"><b><a href="tailoring.html">Tailoring Guide</a></b></font></p>

<p>This is the main reason for coming here. My <a href="tailoring.html">Tailoring
Guide</a> is an up-to-date list of recipes and related information on tailoring in
Everquest. It was compiled from various sources on the net, my own in-game efforts,
and the many contributions of the people who use the guide. I believe this to be
the most complete resource about this trade skill available.</p>

<p>This is an original map of the <a href="lesserfaydark.gif">Lesser Faydark</a> zone
that I created. Watch out for the Brownies in the north west corner, and the Dark Elves
along the south wall!</p>

<p>The <a href="re-orig.jpg">original map</a> is a scan of an absolutely wonderful
hand-drawn map by Phingers, Raxthorne and Drakkaenn of Mithaniel Marr. These people
clearly spent a lot of time on their map, and their work is greatly appreciated!
<a href="re-tulin.gif">My variation</a> on their map was done strictly to make it
a little more computer and printer friendly, and to appeal to neat-freaks, like me.</p>
