   'Greetings Loherangrin! <BR>
   I am Drenic Garrison, Governor of Science
   here in Katta Castellum. <BR>
   I am currently involved in several scientific
   endeavors with the other governors and am
   in need of assistance supplying my researchers
   with the proper [materials and samples] for
   their studies. </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is materials and samples?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Drenic Garrison says <BR>
   'The Magus Conlegium are assisting with some
   studies on the physiology of the Vampyres
   of the Coterie of the Eternal Night and are
   in need of [ash and blood] samples. <BR>
   Maralicis Dilsm our Governor of Health is
   assisting in research on [counteragents]
   to the venom and diseases native to Luclin.
   <BR>
   Finally, there have been reports from the
   agents of Erikal Wolfeye that there is a
   civilization of [snake people] that live
   on the furthest reaches of the light side
   of Luclin in a region devoid of atmosphere.

   'To the west beyond the Twilight Sea is an
   airless grey region between the light and
   dark sides of Luclin. <BR>
   Some time ago our scouts cooperating with
   powerful members of the Magus Conlegium attempted
   to chart the expanses of the barren treacherous
   region. <BR>
   During this excursion the scouts and magi
   encountered a small group of strange snake
   like men. <BR>
   The magi detected no magical aid that was
   allowing the creatures to move freely in
   the airless void without danger of suffocation.
   <BR>
   When approached the snake men quickly fled.
   <BR>
   We wish to know how these creatures survive
   in such conditions. <BR>
   If they prove to be a hostile species then
   we will have to resort to examining their
   [anatomy]. </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is anatomy?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Drenic Garrison says 'I wish to examine the
   lungs or whatever breathing organs these
   creature have. It would not be prudent to
   hunt and kill a living member of this species
   and society we know practically nothing about
   but there are several undead snake men in
   the region as well. I will require three
   such organs however to perform the proper
   experiments. </SPAN><BR>
