   <BR>
   Meez always liked da taste of dem [high elves]

   Makes dem taste kinda like a rabbit. <BR>
   Soes anyway, meez saw one alone one day so
   meez run it down and kills it good. <BR>
   But it weren't a high elf. <BR>
   It wuz really one of dem dark elves dat had

   udder elves. I ates him anyway but he wuz
   kinda stringy. <BR>

   Soes meez gots dis ring and I can use it
   ta look like one of dem high elves. <BR>
   Meez thought it wuz a good way to git dem.
   <BR>
   Soes I walk around in dair villages and stuff
   for a while and thought about all dem tasty
   elves. <BR>
   But meez had a [problem]. <BR>
   Even though I could get close to dem lookin
   like day do, day wouldn't follow me away
   from dair towns soes I could eat dem. <BR>

   'Da problem is dat dose elves talk in a funny
   accent. <BR>
   Day would look at me funny when I talks to
   dem. <BR>
   Soes this is what meez do. <BR>
   I looked fer one of da smart ones ta leave
   from his shop one night and I caught him
   but didn't eat him. <BR>
   I took him back to da [cave] I was stayin
   in. <BR>
   I kept da ring on still but meez told him
   I wanted him to learn meez to talk like da
   udder elves. <BR>
   After learnin me dat, meez said meez would
   let him go. </SPAN><BR>

   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'Soes he learn me ta talk like da elves do.
   <BR>
   Took a few months but I learned it. <BR>
   I figgered it was worth all da effort since
   meez would have all da high elf meat meez
   could want after dat. <BR>
   After meez tink he did a good job at teachin
   me to talk like da udder elves, meez ate
   him. <BR>
   Want meez ta [show you how] dose elves talk

   Perhaps you would be interested in purchasing
   one of my savory meat pies.'' <BR>
   <BR>
   Day are stoopid like dat. <BR>
   Meez could say enough tings like dem dat
   day weren't no longer scared. <BR>
   Soes what I did next wuz what [started] meez

   and took da stuff he didn't need. <BR>
   Meez yoozed da money ta buy a small [shop
   near Kelethin]. <BR>
   Meez sold stuff in da day and at night meez
   went after da high elves. <BR>
   Day were easy ta catch at night cuz dair
   is less people around and day was drunk lots
   of times.' </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is shop near Kelethin?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'Meez made a lot of money in dat little shop
   sellin da meat pies I made outta all da elves.
   <BR>
   Udders like da humies and dorfs started ta
   come to meez shop ta buy da meat pies too.
   <BR>
   Everybody loved da meat pies and thought
   day was good. <BR>
   So many peeples wer commin ta meez shop dat
   I had ta [step up production]. <BR>
   Troll cookin is da best cookin, course day
   thought meez was a high elf. <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What step up production?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'Yeah. <BR>
   Meez needed lots more meat soes I could fills
   all da orders. <BR>
   Pretty soon though, peeples started ta notice
   all da missing elves and started gettin worried.
   <BR>
   Da streets of Felwithe started lookin kinda
   empty actually. <BR>
   Da stoopid elves thought it was vampires
   from Castle Mistmoore dat was takin peeple.
   <BR>
   Anyways, meez had ta lower da standards and
   started mixin in some wood elf and even humie
   and dorf once in a while. <BR>
   But it still wasn't [enough]. <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What stil wasn't enough?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'Usually meez go out and get da fresh meat
   I needed fer da pies but I came up with a
   better idea. <BR>
   Meez stay open late and let da meat come
   to me! <BR>
   Dat way meez need to hunt less and could
   spend more time at da shop cookin up da pies.
   <BR>
   Dat worked good for a while. <BR>
   Something [bad] happened one night though.
   <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is bad?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'It was late in da night and dis dorf came
   stumblin into da shop. <BR>
   He was real drunk and I thoughts he might
   add a tangy zip to da pies with all da liquor
   in em. <BR>
   Soes when he turns around I swung meez cleaver
   to take his ugly head off but it broke when
   it hit sumthin hard around dis dorf's neck.
   <BR>
   Come to find out da dorf has dis big [iron
   collar] around his neck. <BR>
   Of course, he starts screaming like a dorf.
   <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is iron collar?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'Yeah. <BR>
   Some stoopid peeple dat thought it was vampires
   started wearin dese big iron collars around
   dair necks at night to keep from bein bit.
   <BR>
   So I gots dis dorf bellowing all loud soes
   I put my hand over his head and tries to
   smother him. <BR>
   Dem dorfs are pretty tough. <BR>
   He bit meez finger clean off. <BR>
   Turn out ta be da finger dat had da ring
   on it. So now da dorf knows meez am a troll
   and he start yellin even louder. <BR>
   Den meez started hearin [voices coming] toward
   da shop. </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is voices coming?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'Da dorf attracted a lot of attention with
   all his yellin. <BR>
   A pretty big crowd showed up so meez started
   runnin. <BR>
   Since day no like da trolls, day was pretty
   mad. <BR>
   I got away okay but all dem wizards and druids
   and magicians day got over dere burnt me
   up pretty good. <BR>
   Dats why I have all dese nice blotchy scars.
   <BR>
   [What happened next] was da best part. Cazic-Thule
   was really happy. <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What happened next?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'Meez was pretty popular before day knew
   dat meez was a troll. <BR>
   Everyone in Faydwer knew about da pies I
   made and most of dem peeples dere liked da
   meat pies a lot. But when day searched da
   shop after meez ran away, day found all da
   heads of da peeples dat turned up missin.
   <BR>
   Dats when day finally realized dat da missin
   peeple were in da pies day all liked. <BR>
   Dis is da [fun part] dat really got Cazic-Thule's
   attention. </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is fun part?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched laughs and says, <BR>
   'When day all found out dat day had been
   eatin dair friends all dis time word spread
   real fast. <BR>
   Peeples all over was hor-ee-fied. Some didn't
   sleep for weeks and many refused to eat for
   a long time. <BR>
   Dem elves live a long time and dose dat still
   remember still have nightmares about it and
   are still scared to eat. <BR>
   All dis fear I caused made Cazic-Thule really
   happy so he took me from dis plane. <BR>
   And still my [legend] is told quietly by
   some of dem elves.' </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is legend?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'Oh yeah. <BR>
   Day tell dair little elves if day ain't gud,
   Rosrak will come bake dem into a pie and
   eat dem. <BR>
   Some tink dat dis is only a legend told ta
   scare peeples. <BR>
   But whether day knows it's true or not, day
   still feed Cazic Thule with da fear caused
   by dat story. <BR>
   Heh. <BR>
   Meez not know what da big deal is with eatin
   a good pie but elves and dose udder peeples
   are pretty stoopid ta start with. </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is Realm of Heroes?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Rasrok the Blotched says <BR>
   'Yeah dat iz where meez from. <BR>

   High Elfに変身するRingでElfを騙し、食べていたらしい。<BR>
   RingはDark Elfが作った?又は持っている?<BR>
   出てきた地名はKelethin。<BR>
   Kelethinの郊外に店なんてあったっけかな。Lesser
   Faydarkのアレしか思い浮かばんな・・・<BR>
   そう言えばあそこにDragoonが出るようになってたな・・・<BR>
   しかしCaveは無い。<BR>
   <BR>
   文脈からすると、Ringを再び手に入れてRasrokにあげるか、Elf
   Meat PieをElfに食べさせると Cazic-Thule神が喜んでCoinをくれるとかいう感じかな?<BR>
   Meat Pieちゅうと、WFPに売ってる奴がいたな・・・<BR>
