   With the rising [activities] of the most

   'The Vampire Lord, Mayong Mistmoore, who
   continues his tyrannical and monstrous rise
   in power within our neighboring forest had
   begun to manifest is power in attempts to
   further his rule and dominion over the continent
   of Faydwer. <BR>
   In the Lord's attempts, he unleashed the
   Lycanthropy virus upon the forests, infecting
   many of our nation's people. <BR>
   In time, the virus had been eliminated and
   was no longer a threat, but the [souls] of
   those who were unfortunate enough to meet
   the council did not survive, but were avenged.

   Far too many condemned souls. <BR>
   There was nothing we could do for them but
   ease their pain and assist to keep the virus
   from spreading to the other inhabitants of
   our nation. <BR>
   No cure existed, and to this day, a cure
   continues to evade us. <BR>
   I still remember the [last] victim that I
   had to condemn before Tunare chose me for
   ascension. <BR>

   the youngest that our council had to attend

   of her pleading mother. <BR>
   Forever I shall regret that decision, and

   a cure there if we did not further our search
   for one. <BR>
   She would not allow her daughter to fall
   to the same fate as all the others had. <BR>
   We ignored her threat, and in turn, the girl
   now walks as a servant of Mistmoore, eternally
   embraced as one of his monstrous creations.

   I pray with every waking energy of my being
