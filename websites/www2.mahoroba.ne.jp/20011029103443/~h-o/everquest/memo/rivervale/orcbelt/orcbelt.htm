   We require more deputies in this squad. <BR>
   We are suffering great losses to the [new
   threat]. <BR>
   Welcome to the Great Wall Patrol where our
   motto is, 'United we shall defend.' <BR>
   It will be some time before you can earn
   your squad ring - first you must prove your
   strength in battle. <BR>
   Report to the squad leader. <BR>
   He is Deputy Budo. <BR>
   You can find him at the Great Wall of Serilis
   in the Misty Thicket. <BR>
   Go to him at once and tell him you are reporting
   for duty. </SPAN><BR>

   'Hail, Loherangrin . <BR>
   I am Deputy Budo Bullnose, the squad leader
   of the Great Wall Patrol. <BR>
   Be very careful in the lands beyond the wall.
   <BR>
   They are filled with dangerous beasts, as
   well as [Clan Runnyeye]. </SPAN><BR>

   <SPAN class="log">Deputy Budo says <BR>
   'Stand tall then, Deputy Loherangrin . <BR>
   Your orders are to keep the creatures from
   venturing into the community of Rivervale
   and to kill many goblins. <BR>
   Check the goblin bodies, if you should find
   unbroken warrior beads on them, take them
   to Sheriff Roglio Bruth and should you be
   lucky enough to find a bizarre grappling
   device, you are to take it to Marshal Ghobber
   Truppack immediately! <BR>
   One more thing - should you defeat any orcs
   in battle, bring me their leather belts and
   I shall reward you for the great victory.
   <BR>
   May the power of Underfoot be with you! </SPAN><BR>

   You will become a full-fledged deputy in

   You should check in with Marshal Ghobber

   your squad ring. <BR>
   Just go up to him and ask, 'Am I one with
   the Wall?' <BR>
   He will know, but you must first show your
   bravery in many battles against the goblins.
