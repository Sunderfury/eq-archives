      Marshal Ghobber says <BR>
      'Great!!! We require more deputies in this
      squad. We are suffering great losses to the
      [new threat]. Welcome to the Great Wall Patrol
      where our motto is, 'United we shall defend.'
      It will be some time before you can earn
      your squad ring - first you must prove your
      strength in battle. Report to the squad leader.
      He is Deputy Budo. You can find him at the
      Great Wall of Serilis in the Misty Thicket.
      Go to him at once and tell him you are reporting
      for duty. <BR>

      'Hail, Loherangrin . I am Deputy Budo Bullnose,
      the squad leader of the Great Wall Patrol.
      Be very careful in the lands beyond the wall.
      They are filled with dangerous beasts, as

      Deputy Budo says <BR>
      'Stand tall then, Deputy Loherangrin . Your
      orders are to keep the creatures from venturing
      into the community of Rivervale and to kill
      many goblins. Check the goblin bodies, if
      you should find unbroken warrior beads on
      them, take them to Sheriff Roglio Bruth and
      should you be lucky enough to find a bizarre
      grappling device, you are to take it to Marshal
      Ghobber Truppack immediately! One more thing
      - should you defeat any orcs in battle, bring
      me their leather belts and I shall reward
      you for the great victory. May the power
      of Underfoot be with you! <BR>

      'Grand work, Deputy Loherangrin ! You will
      become a full-fledged deputy in no time.
      You should check in with Marshal Ghobber
      from time to time to see if you have earned
      your squad ring. Just go up to him and ask,
      'Am I one with the Wall?' He will know, but
      you must first show your bravery in many
      battles against the goblins. <BR>
