   I was so scared. My hands wouldn't stop trembling.
   <BR>
   Amstaf pulled me off to the side before the
   initial attack began. <BR>
   He held my hands within his. <BR>

   I vowed that day that I'd follow him into

   She knew of the powers of nature. <BR>
   She was able to control the rain which fell
   from the heavens and would call upon the
   spirits to aide her. <BR>
   It was obvious that Amstaf took a liking
   to Ambreen. <BR>
   She ended up coming along with us on our
   crusades. <BR>
   The last that I saw of Ambreen was when we
   went to the snow covered lands of Everfrost.

   However, the storm didn't pass through and
   we knew we couldn't venture to far without
   the fear of freezing. <BR>
   I warmed the cabin and rested for some time
   thinking about what we were going to do.
   <BR>
   It wasn't long before my exhaustion took
   over. <BR>
   I fell into a deep [ slumber ] that night.

   Random thoughts kept swirling around my mind.

   I kept seeing the image of a cloaked being

   I saw Ambreen's body convulsing above the

   <TD><SPAN class="question">Q1.NPCがいません。</SPAN><BR>
   <DL>
    <DT>各NPCは非常に分かりやすい場所にいます。そして固定POPで移動しません。<BR>
    ただRyshon Hunsti以外のNPCはQuestをしてアイテムを貰うと消えてしまいます。<BR>
    また、倒してもFaction変化が無いらしく（←今後修正される可能性もありますが）、誰かが殺してしまっている場合もあるようです。<BR>
    Kiteされたりすると何処かに行ったままStackしてしまうので、30分待ってもいない場合はTrackingで探すしか無いと思います。<BR>
    （もしくは/PetitionしてGuideにNPCを元の位置に戻してもらう）<BR>Ryshon HunstiはQuestをしても絶対消えないので、いない場合はまず間違い無くこれでしょう。
   </DL>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">Q2.会話ができません。</SPAN><BR>
   <DL>
    <DT>ちょっと特殊なQuestになっていて、連絡アイテム（手紙・ネックレス）を渡すと彼らは一旦消え、同じ名前のNPCがSpawnし直します。<BR>
    だから最初渡す時はNPCにターゲットが当たっていますが、Respawn時にターゲットがクリアされてしまいます。<BR>
    アイテムを渡した後NPCをターゲットし直してください。会話が出来るようになります。<BR>
    同様の理由により、アイテムを渡す前にキーワードを言っても会話ができません。<BR>アイテムを渡す前と後では名前は一緒でも違うNPCだということです。
   </DL>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">Q3.最後にCOMBINEしますが鍛冶スキルは必要ですか?</SPAN><BR>
   <DL>
    <DT>Armor of Roに鍛冶スキルが必要な時代もあったので、こういう悩みが出ているのだと思います。<BR>
    しかし、鍛治スキルは全く要りません。<BR>
    BagなどをもらってCOMBINEする類のものはスキルは一切必要無いです。<BR>もし失敗した場合はスキルのせいでは無く、入れるアイテムが間違っていたからです。
