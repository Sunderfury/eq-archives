      'I dont get many visitors in these isolated
      regions. Have you come to learn of the ancient
      tribes of the Iksar?<BR>

      <FONT color="#00ffff">You say, 'hail I have come to learn of the
      ancient tribes of the Iksar'</FONT><BR>
      Professor Akabao says <BR>
      'There were five tribes of Iksars that rose
      from the ashes of the Shissar Empire and
      founded their kingdoms on the continent of
      Kunark. Three of the tribes were extinguished
      many years later by the Kunzar tribe which
      is the tribe that the current Iksar are descendant
      from. I focus my studies on learning of the
      extinct tribe of Kylong. <BR>
      <BR>
      <FONT color="#00ffff">You say, 'What is Kylong'</FONT><BR>
      Professor Akabao says <BR>
      'The Kylong were a mountain dwelling tribe
      of Iksar that strove for esoteric knowledge.
      They had vast libraries of ancient magical
      tomes that had been acquired from the Shissar
      sorcerers, and strove to understand and put
      the rituals documented in the tomes to practical
      use. When the Kunzar armies marched upon
      the Kylong, the three greatest Kylong mystics
      shattered the Medallion of Kylong, a holy
      relic of their tribe and fled their mountain
      homes in order to prevent the Kunzar from
      reassembling the Medallion of Kylong.<BR>

      Professor Akabao says <BR>
      'I have been attempting to learn of the destinations
      of the three Kylong leaders that held the
      fragments of the medallion. I know only that
      they sought shelters to hide and continue
      the practice of their mystical arts In order
      to one day return their tribe to it's former
      glory. Their remains may exist beneath some
      of the fortresses that are centers of Iksar
      and Sarnak necromancy. I have seen indications
      that some of the tomes within those fortresses
      are In fact the very tomes once cherished
      by the Kylong. Should you manage to recover
      the broken pieces of the Medallion of Kylong
      brIng them to me so that I may restore the
      ancient artifact.<BR>
