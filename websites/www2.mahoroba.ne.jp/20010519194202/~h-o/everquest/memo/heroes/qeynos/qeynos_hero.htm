   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'Greetings Loherangrin , I am Jaylia the
   Faithful, daughter of Raiston and Launa Lightmist.
   <BR>
   I was born in Qeynos while it was under the
   rule of Antonius Bayle III. <BR>
   My parents were both paladins of [Rodcet
   Nife] and protectors of the city. <BR>
   They saw to it that I learn the ways of the
   [Holy Knights].</SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'Who is Rodcet Nife?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'Rodcet Nife is The Prime Healer. <BR>
   It was he who sent me to take my place amongst
   the [Realm of Heroes]. <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is Realm of Heroes?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'The Realm of Heroes is a place for those
   who have proven themselves worthy of being
   in the presence of the gods beyond Norrath.
   <BR>
   My [act of faithfulness] destined me to walk
   amongst the other Heroes in the Realm. <BR>
   Many of us have journeyed back to Norrath
   to seek out heroes that are deemed worthy
   of the same. <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is act of faithfulness?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'My act of faithfulness came at a time when
   a dreadful plague shadowed the Qeynos area.
   <BR>
   The plague spread so fast the priests could
   not cure the diseased quick enough. <BR>
   The City Council of Qeynos, with the approval
   of Antonius Bayle III, put into action a
   [plan] to end the suffering. <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is plan?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'A group of warriors were sent out into the
   fields to kill each animal that was infected
   with the disease in an effort to keep it
   from spreading any further. <BR>
   The few remaining [healthy priests] were
   sent out to maintain the warriors' health.
   <BR>
   The priests became ill and had to return.
   <BR>
   The warriors became infected themselves and
   struggled to perform their duties. <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'Who is healthy priests?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'With the exception of the High Priests who
   were too old to make such a journey, I was
   one of the only healthy priests that remained.
   <BR>
   I traveled out into the fields where the
   warriors were and cured them as fast as I
   could. <BR>
   As I worked my way across the plains, I began
   to feel a bit dizzy and realized that I had
   been stricken with the plague, yet I [refused]
   to waste my energy on myself. </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What did you refuse?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'At that moment, I reached my hands up into
   the air and shouted, 'Rodcet Nife, Prime
   Healer of all! <BR>
   Give me the strength to go on. <BR>
   Too many have suffered. <BR>
   These brave warriors have fallen. <BR>
   My mother has joined you. <BR>
   Please, allow me to go on so that I may assist
   the [remaining brave souls] before I, too,
   join you!' </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is the remaining brave souls?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'I continued on toward the remaining warriors.
   <BR>
   Again, I cured them as quickly as I could.
   <BR>
   The tide of the battle slowly turned and
   the warriors began to defeat the remaining
   infected animals. <BR>
   There were bodies of fallen heroes and slain
   infected creatures as far as the eye could
   see. <BR>
   I knew then that my [end] was near. <BR>
   </SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is your end?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'I stood silently with my arms to my sides
   and looked out across the plains. <BR>
   I raised my hands into the air once more
   and simply said, 'I am ready now.' <BR>
   I then fell to the ground and was raised
   to the Realm of Heroes, newly christened
   'Jaylia the Faithful.' </SPAN><BR>

   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is holy knights?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'My parents provided me with a vast amount
   of knowledge. <BR>
   I was taught the ways of the Holy Knights
   at the Temple of Thunder and the Temple of
   Life. <BR>
   After the death of my father, I was sent
   to [Freeport] to study the holy ways of the
   Knights of Truth. </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is Freeport?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'Freeport is a trade city to the northeast
   of Qeynos. <BR>
   A few years after going to Freeport, I received
   an urgent message from Qeynos. <BR>
   My mother had taken ill and I was needed
   in Qeynos immediately. <BR>
   When I returned home, it was too late. <BR>
   My mother had passed away due to a plague
   created by [heretics]. </SPAN><BR>
   <BR>
   <SPAN class="question">You say, 'What is heretics?'</SPAN><BR>
   <SPAN class="log">Jaylia the Faithful says <BR>
   'Many years before I was born, after the
   Erudite heretics completed the construction
   of Paineel, they began practicing with unique
   forms of diseases. <BR>
   These dangerous experiments were not confined
   within the walls of the dark city. <BR>
   They expanded their research to the animals
   in the plains of Karana. <BR>
