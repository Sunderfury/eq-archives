<TR><TD>Created the <A HREF="maps.html">Map Cycle</A> page (get to it from the intro page).  Contained on this page will be the current map cycle for
Muaddib's server and links to download the maps.  Also, semesters basically over (one final left), so I plan on finishing a lot of projects that need work.<BR>

<TR><TD>Ok, as you can see I've changed the site up a little.  More to come.  The most important thing that is changed is our EverQuest guild now has
a page.  Just click on "EverQuest" on your left.

<TR><TD>Been a long time since I last updated...I've been meaning to change the layout of the site, but haven't yet.  I'll see what I can do.
Anyway, Clan GNG has a nice web page at <A HREF="http://gng.sputnikfx.com/" TARGET="_top">http://gng.sputnikfx.com/</A>.  Might check it out if you want :).
