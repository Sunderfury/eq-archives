There's more to the world than Quake.  I didn't wanna be strapped 
down to just playing Quake all the time as a clan, if we wanted to
play Jedi Knight, or Starcraft, or Rainbow Six, or whatever.  Divided
Loyalties allows its members that flexibility &#151; the ability to play as
a clan whatever they want &#151; not just Quake.</TD></TR>

I used to think that Divided Loyalties was just a name.
But now, it's an idea.  The idea that we can play anyway
or anything we want without having to worry about "does
our clan approve?"  It's a novel concept.

Divided Loyalties is not just our clan name it is the way we interact with each other.  
During normal game play we divide up and play our favorite online game, and are very adamant that it is the best 
game.  Even when we do play together, we find it invigorating to play against each other using the rest of the 
team for fodder.  Though When the time comes we can come together to create a &#34;force to be reckoned 
with&#34; [quote from Bandit_Z].  When we play together we have the most fun, assuming there is an opposing force 
that poses a challenge.

Divided Loyalties means that we have many personal objectives.  
Like the hydra that has many heads but one body, we have skill, 
independent thought, and goals that come together to form one 
purpose.  Each head deadly in it's own right, but devastating as a 
whole.

Well, to me DLC means we are, in respect, individuals.  We can gather the 
power when we get together but when we are alone people fear us.  DLC, to me, 
is the greatest power in the universe.  DLC comes in many forms from Quake2-3 
to Tribes.  We can take any game and turn it into DLC power.  We are the most 
extrovert players on the net.  Even though we have good ping doesn't mean we 
are good but we showed Clan_Z and the rest of the people at the LAN party 
what we are made of.  No one I mean NO one stands in the way of DLC.  NO ONE!

Divided Loyalties describes us, we are as diverse in our gaming 
preferences as we are in life.  We are not tied to one game only, 
but rather are loyal to many different titles.  It describes our 
entirely different playing styles.  It describes our individuality, 
and freedom. And in one statement: Each of us is deadly as an 
individual, but as a group, the power of the whole is greater than 
the sum of the power of it's parts.
