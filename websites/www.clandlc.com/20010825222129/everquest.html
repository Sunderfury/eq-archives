<CENTER><H3>Divided Loyalties Guild Charter:</H3></CENTER>
<P>Divided Loyalties are enlightened ones who keep their oaths to 
their race and to anyone who has earned their friendship and trust.  
Once someone has earned friendship, it transcends all racial 
hatreds.</P>

<P>The core belief of Divided Loyalties commands that we will 
never make a promise we cannot keep.  To break an oath to an 
outsider incurs the most severe of penalties.  To break an oath to 
another member of the guild incurs death.  For if one cannot keep 
one's pact in this greedy and selfish world, then they should be put 
down like a dog.  Our loyalty is first to the guild, and second to 
ourselves.  We will never aid those that beg, for they are not worthy 
of the blood in their veins.  If one stands fast against his enemies 
when his doom is certain, he will be exalted among us.  This one 
we will profit until the last of us have been slain.</P>

<P>Every member's name has been written in the Book of Honor, 
which keeps the precepts laid out here.  Trusted Allies and Friends names are
written in the Book of Trust.  Enemies and Betrayers names are written in the
Book of Dishonor.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Rules:</H3></CENTER>
<P>We don't have many rules, just that the Guild members abide by the charter.  If you have a question about an action ask Khelan or Jorus and 
we'll tell you if it's alright or not.  The goal of this guild is to be a small, trustworthy bunch of players so that we can assist other
guilds in planes raids, or dungeon crawls.  To that extent, we're trying to keep the guild down to a minimum of players (no more then 15).  Besides
our initial recruiting period, we'll not recruit many ppl very often.</P>

<P>In order to be recruited, the player must be grouped with a member of the guild for a
while.  If this member sees that the player is very trustworthy and fun to play with, his recruitment will be considered.  The Officers will then consult 
and decide whether or not to recruit a person.  If they are recruited, then they are on probation until an Officer has decided that they are full fledged members.
During this probationary period, the member who requested the new person is responsible for all actions that player does.  If the new recruit shows that
he cannot be trusted, then he will be kicked out of the guild.  That person will never be reinvited, except under the most extreme circumstances.  Current DLC
members are invited into the guild upon request.</P>
