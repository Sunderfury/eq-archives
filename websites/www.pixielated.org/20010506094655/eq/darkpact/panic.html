they can't handle? Why is it they always Fear Death, and thus Panic?</P>

<P>It's human nature, an instinct since the day we were born, to fear death,
and panic to survive. It's called the 'fight or flight' instinct. However,
when we start to loose, or someone gives us extra, or we get jumped, there
is often panic. This panic usually causes a train to a zoneline.</P>

<P>What we must learn to do, is fight back this instinct. Granted, I have
a bit of an edge, logging well over 1,000 hours and living nearly a dozen
lives. But in these lives I've found out one thing; if you panic you die.
Here is why.</P>

<P>Panicking is running. Possibly past more dangerous things.</P>

<P>Running means you can't be targeted by people who can help, the monsters
on you can't be targeted, or by the time either one is targeted, you've
run out of the spell range to be helped.</P>

<P>When in combat, think. Take a very careful account of your life, the
rounds that are passing, and what are the chances for victory. If you have
reached half your life or mana and think 'I'm not going to make this', stay
calm. Shout for help, shout an exact location where you need the help, then
be there, or wait for help if it's where you are. 9 times out of 10 if I
shout for help and stand still, help arrives and I'm fine. I can guarantee
if you shout for help and then run 9 times out of 10 you will die.</P>

<P>What really primed this rant? Someone trained a very large creature to
zone. One which, at this current point in time, I happen to be hunting.
I had to run, following his ass for about 2 full minutes. I could not help
by healing him or taking it off him, because I was running as he was. He
did make it to the zone line, I followed to a casting distance and began
to cast. But guess what, in the 3.5 - 5 seconds it took to get in position
and cast some poor sod and his group came in. He was killed, his companions
took a massive beating, then my spell went off. I fought and killed the
monster, and things were fine again.</P>

<P>The person training lived. One person entering the zone died, probably
before he even realized what had happened, and his party took a pretty good
beating.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Don't panic. Watch your life. If you aren't going to make it, stay calm,
ask for help. Die gracefully with honor if none comes. Remember your not
the only one in the zone. There are probably people there hunting even the
biggest things who may be able to help.</P>

<P>Panic guarantees your death, possibly the death of others. If your going
to loose a few hours of experience dying, accept it. Don't ruin someone
elses day by taking them down with you.</P>

<P>It's a game. It's not a race to 50 th level (or whatever that may be
if your reading this after they change the max). It's an enjoyment of spending
your time with others. Try to remember this and know, no one is happy when
someone else causes their death.</P>

<P>If you can't type fast, make a hotkey for /yell. I know some here are
younger and don't type fast enough to make an intelligent shout. So use
/yell. Know the area. Know where people may be that can help, move there,
use the key. Don't run.
