"3">I've always been sort of a misfit. I was always last to be picked on teams in the real world. I never have made friends easily. I was never very smart, nor very dumb. Well, actually I was both as in high school I got A's in art classes and D's in English and Math.</P>
		<p>In world my interests primarily keep me apart from the majority of my 'peers'. I am often still not one picked early for groups, but those who match my style do pick me.</p>
		<p>Now I'm older, I'm more focused. I am in the right time and place for me. In my journey through college I am appreciated for my knowledge, creativity and understanding, yet still I lack the bond of comradery. I have the respect and ease of getting along I once lacked, yet I am still not accepted into peoples lives.</p>
		<p>The fact I'm older, the fact I'm so sure of myself and my direction and purpose now holds me back.</p>
		<p><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></p>
		<p>Will I ever be accepted in whole? or just ever in part. I don't know.</p>
		<p>I may ever be doomed to walk this, and all words, the cleric / psychologist / philosopher. But at least I know my place and purpose.</p>
		<p>I may always be alone and sad, but I know because I can help others I will never be incomplete, unfulfilled or without purpose.</p>
