"3">I have been in EQ since release and the idiocy, and lack of information
on this, amazes me.</P>

<P>Since 30 th I had been trying to get my specialize up and working. It
took me 1.25 levels. Not because that's how long the skill took to train
up, but because that's how long it took me to work my way through 3 guides,
5 players, and a GM or Admin to get the information on how exactly it works
to get my specialization.</P>

<P>At 30 th I was excited. I hit the point where I could get specialize.
I immediately went back home to train, a 45 minute trip in itself, with
sow. I train in 15 points, and start using a 1st level spell which uses
that skill. Boom, the first point I get is the 45 th specialization point.
I think great this will take no time at all. Zap, zap, zap, casting after
casting, another point, and another and another. Then I sit to med. Full
charge, good to go, stand back up and repeat. Very quickly it has reached
the 50 th point mark. I think good, just a few more, it will hit 51, and
lock in. But no, what's happening, it doesn't seem to be coming. Approximately
2 hours later, I have hailed the first of Guides to see what is wrong. He
says, as I had been thinking, maybe I need more experience, and to gain
31 st level before it will allow me that 51 st point. Fine. I spend the
next 24 hours doing so.</P>

<P>I hit 31 st, run home, so I can be where I need to be to train the others
just as soon as I get this one to the 51 st point, where it will lock as
my special as I had previously heard. 2 hours later I'm pissed as hell.
It's not gone up, and it's been a whole level since I got the damn skill.
Whats going on? Ok, I make another petition and have a few conversations
with fellow clerics to see whats up. I get one telling me some just don't
seem to go quickly, others who say yea, they changed because one didn't
seem willing to come, and another cleric who convinced me to change my specilazation
to a different type. I figure, oh hell, ok Innoruks will, I will take the
hint and change specials. I go to train up put in 10 training, and start
hitting myself with that 1st level spell again. Within 2 bars of mana I've
gone from 41 st to 50 th skill point. But the 51st will not come. I burn
8 more bars, and now it's stuck.</P>

<P>Great, now I have 2 specials that may pop and lock at any second. Now
I will be forced to go back out into the field, group to gain experience,
and fight in a form I am not naturally used to fighting. I spend the next
1.5 bubbles of exp fighting like this when I have finally had enough. I
angrily petition that I need to speak to a GM or Admin immediately (not
a guide).</P>

<P>3 hours later I get the tell. I explain my long and sad story and he
says he 'believes' that I need to train in all of the specializations for
one to exceed to the 51 st point. So I think, finally Approximately 24+
hours later I have what sounds like a good theory. Granted by this time
I was ready to try this theory myself. I go home, train 2 points into the
remaining specialization skills I had not previously trained in and boom,
within about 10 casts I get my 51st point.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Only 1 of the magical specialization skills will exceed to a 51st point
and beyond. The rest will top out at 50. The first to exceed 51 becomes
that one that you will have exceed 50, don't blow it.</P>

<P>All of the specialization skills must be active (at least 1 training
point spent) in order for that one skill you want to pass to the 51st point.</P>

<P>I recommend when you hit your specialization level to train 1 point in
the ones you don't want (as I did 2 and the 1st points I got were 30 something)
and then repeatedly cast a 1st level spell of the type you do want on yourself
(if this is damage be careful not to die, better still do it near a cleric).
Within a few bars (not bubbles) it should rapidly exceed to the 51st point.
