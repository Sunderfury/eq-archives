"3">On occasion throughout my life I've been accused of Kill Stealing.</P>

<P>Last night something happened that really upset me though. Someone auctioned
free buffs, notably Celerity. Knowing that's an enchanter buff, and thus
Clarity was available, I went over to grab it. When I got there they were
in combat. I sat and waited. After a while I implied that I had come for
it. It was then suggested that if I Resolutioned there group I <B>may</B>
get it. I stated they should refine their definition of free, but decided
to do so. After a few more minutes, still no Clarity. I was in fact told
the enchanter was afk, and asked not to med there. So I said fine, and went
on my way. A few minutes later I was told they were back, I could see them
moving around, so I sat down to med. Again I still had not received it.
After several minutes I was told by someone in the group there was a bit
of a disagreement weather I would get it or not. It seemed the enchanter
was unwilling to give it, despite his auction to give away &quot;free&quot;
buffs, because of his believe I was a KSer.</P>

<P>Now, mind you I've been accused of being a KSer before, this was nothing
new. I am very familiar with hatred both because of personal actions / believes,
as well as racial hatred, simply because I'm a Dark Elf, I must be or think
x, how could it be otherwise. However, what bothered me was his reluctance
on a rumor. I had never seen this person before in my life.</P>

<P>I have hereby decided that because of this, and because of an earlier
argument approximately 1 week ago, that I would define what exactly it is
that qualifies as KSing.</P>

<P>Again I remind the readers, this is my opinion, based on this and previous
lives, and only on what I have perceived on my own server.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Kill Stealing is - When someone has already
claimed an available target, and another is continuing to attack it.</FONT></B></P>

<P>In order to define what Kill Stealing is not, we must understand various
things.</P>

<P><B>Available Target</B> - An open target is one that spawns at a camp,
or is a free roaming target (that which is not being pulled, or trained).</P>

<P><B>Derailing</B> - Taking any and all partly damaged targets which have
been Zoned / Forfeited to the zone line. Thus, killing a train.</P>

<P><B>Target Claiming</B> - Is casting, or meleeing, an available target.
Most seem to count from when the spell hits a target. Thus if you cast on
something and someone runs up and hits it via melee, the target has already
been claimed as yours.</P>

<P><B>Trashed Target</B> - Any previously clammed target which is brought
to the zone line for disposal. This is usually done to clear a dungeon for
an individual, or group, to get back to their bodies. They want the way
clear, they don't care who takes the kill.</P>

<P><B>Requesting Help</B> - Any time someone requests help, be it versus
a single or multiple targets, they put all targets up as Forfeit (unless
they request help while keeping their claim).</P>

<P><B>Requesting Help while keeping your claim</B> - Some may request help
and try and keep their claim versus a target.<BR>
Ex - (while fighting monster x, monster y spawns) &quot;Can you take (target
y) off me?&quot;. This person is forfeiting y, but claiming x.<BR>
Ex 2 - &quot;Can I get a heal?&quot;. This person is not putting up the
target as Forfeit, but requesting help in a fashion they will gain the exp.</P>

<P><B>Validating Your Target</B> - You can validate the target by asserting
your claim.<BR>
Ex - &quot;This is ours&quot;.<BR>
Ex 2 - &quot;I'm fine. I'm soloing here.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Zoned / Forfeited Target</B> - Any previously claimed target which
is brought to the zone line. This changes the target from Claimed status
to Trashed. (Unless you are Requsting Help while keeping your claim).</P>

<P>Now that you understand the basics of what I have perceived let me set
a few examples.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Example 1</FONT></B></P>

<P>Group is fighting in room x. They make a bad pull. Instead of one, they
get four. They make a shout &quot;Help in room x&quot;. Player A, B, and
C come in. They are all individual soloists. A and B decide to heal the
group. C decides to claim one of the pulls as theirs, pull it off to the
side and kill it.</P>

<P>Is player C KSing?</P>

<P>No. Player C is not KSing. When the group shouted &quot;Help in room
x&quot; all the targets became Forfeit targets.</P>

<P>How about slightly different... Player C takes the monster that the group
is fighting and does over 1/2, getting the kill.</P>

<P>Is player C then KSing?</P>

<P>Again, No. The group still Forfeited all targets by saying &quot;Help
in room x&quot;.</P>

<P>How about again differently, the group instead shouts &quot;Help in room
x. Take the extras.&quot;</P>

<P>This then asserts retention of the groups claim to the monster they are
currently fighting, thus only forfeiting the extra ones, the ones they are
currently not engaged with.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Example 2</FONT></B></P>

<P>Soloist A is at the zone line. He is pulling there because he is a soloist,
thus keeping an easy escape since he has no group members to count on, and
because if anyone trains he is poised to derail.</P>

<P>Player B comes along and presumes A is in trouble. He takes the kill
from A. Is B KSing?</P>

<P>No. In this instance B was presuming A was in trouble. He was not KSing.</P>

<P>How about if A said &quot;I'm fine&quot; while B was fighting the target?</P>

<P>If B continued and got the kill and experience then yes, he would be
KSing.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>There is a fine line between helping, and KSing. Especially when there
is no zone line to use, as in most of my definitions.</P>

<P>Remember this, most of the people in EQ observe and understand these
societal rules of KSing, weather they have spoken them or not.</P>

<P>If someone starts to KS and your fine, please tell them such. Don't become
upset and try and out speed them to the kill. Don't be vague and say &quot;uh&quot;
or their name. Assert your claim, take the time to say &quot;I'm fine&quot;
or &quot;No help needed, thanks.&quot; If your a slow typer, make a hot
key for it.</P>

<P>Understand that some <B>are</B> just trying to help, they may perceive
your in trouble, and help in a way <B>you</B> would perceive as KSing.</P>

<P>Be specific when you ask for help. If you want to be helped in a certain
way, say so, otherwise whatever you ask for help with is Forfeit.</P>

<P>Most importantly be understanding. A first, even a second time, can be
a misunderstood incident. Remember this is just a game. Sure it's about
getting experience, but more importantly it should be about having fun.</P>

<P>PS- If someone is helping you and your in a position of forfeiting your
target, or you grab a target that was Zoned / Trashed / Forfeited and it's
unclear who now has claim, group them, let them take part of the experience.
Give them a reason to help, and allow them to help without Kill Stealing.
