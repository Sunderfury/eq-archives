<P><IMG SRC="darkpact.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="288" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">Today it was announced on <A HREF="http://eqvault.ign.com/" TARGET=
"_blank">EQ Vault</A> that the rumors of Verant working with Lucas Arts
and others on a Star Wars RPG is true. It's estimated release is 2001 (no
month specified).</P>

<P>While I'm sure there is an entirely different programing team working
on Star Wars than the EQ upgrades and expansions, I find myself wondering
if this has put a 'DoT' on EQ.</P>

<P>Invariably the majority of EQ's players want the newest shiniest thing.
I don't think this is restricted to simply within the world. I'd put high
bet's that EQ will loose approximately 1/2 or more of it's current player
base the day that the Star Wars RPG hit's the shelves.</P>

<P>While I don't mind so much the thought of a new game, a new life, what
I do mind is giving up this life so soon. I was looking forward to a long
life of adventure and exploration. The thought of seeing myself in 'EQ2'
with 3x or more the polygon count, with armor looking something more akin
to Siegfried / Nightmare in Soul Caliber for the Dreamcast, and seeing dragons
so realistic you need to change your underwear.</P>

<P>For many this is just a game, something that inevitably had a 2 year
max shelf life to being with, but I'm sure to a nearly equal portion, this
is a life. A life we want to see consistently grow, develop, and evolve.</P>

<P>Most want to always have something to look forward to. New items, additions
of new zones, expansions which add new races or classes, new levels or lots
of new zones.</P>

<P>I think even just the announcement of a Star Wars RPG in EQ fashion has
already begun the closing of the EQ doors.</P>

<P>Star Wars has an immense fan base, as well as Lucas Arts. I for one have
been a fan of most of Lucas Arts stuff even pre-Star Wars license. They
are well known for doing an excellent job, and in some cases pushing the
limits of systems to a new level of enjoyment. Their story creation is legendary,
and with previous Star Wars licenses they have coordinated with the man
himself on creating new story, vehicle, or city elements. I have yet to
play the Star Wars realtime strategy, but let me say it looks pretty amazing.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Will all the players abandon EQ for Star Wars RPG the day it comes out?<BR>
Will some play both?<BR>
Will some simply not care because they want to stay in a Fantasy base instead
of Science Fiction?<BR>
Will the graphics of SW RPG be 2x, 3x or far better than EQ?<BR>
Will isp speeds cause a greater and more fluid connection?<BR>
Will everyone play on one server with different nodes connecting different
worlds, and within those worlds the zones themselves? (&quot;You have now
entered Tatooene&quot;?)</P>

<P>Only time will tell. I'm sure we will hear plenty of news, and see plenty
of screen shots, as the game comes forth in the coming year.</P>
