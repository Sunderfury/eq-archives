"3">I have been one of many to see the evolution of the gaming industry,
both Pen &amp; Paper and Computer. Though thankfully I am still very young
*wink*.</P>

<P>Over the years the computer role playing genra has evolved from simple
text, to text with occasional pictures, to moving graphics with some text,
to somewhat 3d dungeons (forward, forward, right, left), to 3d overhead
perspectives in true 3d, to multi user dungeons aka &quot;mud&quot; (text
via online connections), 3d network games, to now full 3d perspective as
well as being an online multi player environment.</P>

<P>Will we ever go back? Will the draw of upcoming games, such as Bauldors
Gate 2, Diablo II, Warcraft 3, pull people away from games like EverQuest
and Asherons Call and satisfy them as much?</P>

<P>Will companies continue to produce such games in the future or follow
the new precedence set by Tribes 2, Battletech 2035, and Freelancer, where
the persistent online multi player environment is the main, if not sole,
focus of the game?</P>

<P>Yes and No.</P>

<P>I think yes, there will still be a market for solo play games, but no
I think they will no longer satisfy the gamers of today in the same way
an online version can.</P>

<P>It's inherent in human nature to want to explore and solve things. (Only
in some areas of the world is it inherent to collect things). The addition
of other players always brings something interesting to the mix. You know
something different is going to happen.</P>

<P>I've spent probably close to or over 100 hours in Lower Guk now, staring
at one of five different rooms that whole time. Yet each group, each experience
is different and interesting.</P>

<P>What makes it so? The players. The unknown of what they may do or say
that causes you to react and feel in different ways.</P>

<P>Would it be as fun if they were scripted AI characters, and I could hand
pick exactly the party I wanted? In my opinion no.</P>

<P>It's our differences as people, our wants, needs, drives, emotions, that
make us interesting.</P>

<P>While we are not playing EQ we feel the urge, the addiction, to get back
into that world. We feel were missing something by not being there.</P>

<P>This doesn't happen with scripted AI. A solo game waits for you, nothing
happens without you. With persistent online multi player worlds, this is
no longer the case. If your not online you may miss meeting a person, or
event, the experiences that are shared or given by that experience. These
differences make the game more appealing and interesting.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>The truth is there will still be a solo play game market for PCs. Probably
as long as the PC exists in it's current form. However, with the current
technology, the ability to sufficiently fool the senses (graphics and emotes
making the characters as visually believable as you know they are mentally),
the new drive to have 'collectable' things emerging, I think it's imperative
for a game to go the multi player online route, as opposed to the randomly
generated AI scripting route.</P>

<P>People make things interesting. Whether you choose to interact with them
or not is your decision. You never know what's going to happen in Norrath
and that's part of what makes it interesting. You may just be joining a
group to kill the same thing you've killed 100 times before. Or you may
watch someone jump off of a ledge to see how much damage they can do to
themselves, find someone giving away or trading this or that item, join
a drunken brawl. These oddities is what makes the game far more interesting
than any solo scripted game. These strange and interesting players, make
for an ever changing and different game.</P>

<P>You will never experience the same thing twice, no matter how hard you
try.</P>

<P><B>PS</B>- Consider this, some day online games may lead the world to
a new level of peace and cross culteral understanding.
