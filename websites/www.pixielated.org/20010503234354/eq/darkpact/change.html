influences us to seek it out? What causes us to fight it?</P>

<P>I think back on my many adventures, and the times which stand out most
are those which involve those questions. Both in real life and in EQ.</P>

<P>What makes us accept change seems typically to revolve around personal
gain. A 'healthy change' being one we ourselves initiate. Or sometimes,
though not usually in cases such as EQ, those which remove something which
now burdens us, which once did not.</P>

<P>That which influences us to seek it out is a more difficult question.
I find most often we seek change when it is to our benefit. What can I learn
new, what will I discover there about this, that, or myself. What can I
do to make myself appeal more to x?</P>

<P>What I find most often lately is what seems to be peoples inherent desire
to fight change. How something different, or not the norm, is inherently
&quot;wrong&quot; in our perception. We become familiar with a person, place
or thing, then fight changes which disturb that homeostasic balance we have
set for ourselves.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Be not unaccepting of change. Be willing to notice and acknowledge it's
there all the time all around us. The world, this or any, and all the beings
in it, are constantly changing. Be aware and able to change, for with that
you can perceive things as they truly are, not how your memory may choose
to perceive them.
