		<CENTER><B>Suggestions / Quick Tips:</B></CENTER>
		<P><B>Binding</B> - Choose your binding locations carefully. Pick one at
least 75 feet from spawn points of monsters or good npcs (as you may accidentally
hit a good person as I did upon gating back to your spawn point, or gate
back to full spawn and be instantly attacked). Choose one on the other side
of a zone that you may run to, or at least 150 feet from it so you can run
in another direction should you, or others, get trained to that zone line.</P>
		<P><B>Specialization</B> - Only one specialization skill can exceed a 50
skill level. All must have points spent in them in order for any one to
pass that 50 th point. See accompanying rant for more details - <A HREF=
"darkpact/specialize.html">Specialization, How I wasted 24 hours of game
time</A> - <A HREF="darkpact/index.html">Darkpact Wrathful</A></P>

<P><a href="darkpact/pet.html"><b>Unswerving Hammer of Faith</b></a><br>
			We Clerics finally have a pet. But is it worth the wait? How does the Cleric pet work, and what is it?</P>
		<p><B>Helping Casters</B> - When casters need help, check how many creatures
are on them. Usually if there is more than 1, if you can pull the others
off they will be fine. I, being cleric, can often solo things if only 1
were on me, but if there are 2 or more, I will be distracted and unable
to cast. Help as quick as you can, but ask if that's the best help you can
offer.</p>
