"3">Last week / weekend I was reminded that some people just don't think
about the consequences of their actions. Two separate incidences reminded
me of something I had forgotten.</P>

<P>I came to Oasis to give my friend some stuff to sell at Saturdays Bazaar
and help him out for a little bit. I hear a shout 'Specters loose. Run'.
Having lived approximately 12 lives and knowing most here are about 15 levels
too low on average to take Specters I shout &quot;I'll get it&quot; and
head off to go wipe me a Specter. Good exp, happy to do so.</P>

<P>I find a few people trying to kill it. They would hit and run. There
green to me. This to me looks like a futile attempt to try and do some damage
to the specter before he reaps his way though the young.</P>

<P>Boom boom boom, 3 shots he's down (Banish Undead, it's a beautiful thing).
I shout that 'he's down and all are safe'. I get a tell within minutes of
something on the order of 'Thanks. We had that. We were kiting it'. My response
was of course was to shout that 'kiting is not the way to kill specters,
as here it leads to deaths of the young'. That 'if you are kiting you should
warn the others, and not do it where they are tying to kill'. I receive
a thank you tell from someone, as apparently these people have been kiting
and killing the young in their wake all evening.</P>

<P>Sunday morning I'm back in Oasis again. Figured I'd stick around and
help my friend out again. So again I hear a shout that 'Specters are loose
on the dunes'. I again go out and wipe the Specters. Since my friend isn't
on I shout that 'this is obviously a problem' that 'they are not as in control
as those hunting may think, and offer to join the hunters'. I get no response.</P>

<P>Later again the shout comes there loose again. I wipe the loose ones
and look around. I discover there are no less than 2 different kiters, and
at least 2 other groups. Again in voicing my wrath for the young I shout
that 'the Specter hunters group together in an effort to take and hold the
island'. That 'pulling them off the island or kiting them is not the way
they should be fought'. Did this change their attitude? Sadly no. It seems
these groups just didn't care, or left (as I didn't see them later).</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>It seems some of the more dangerous creatures, that which are over 10
levels higher than others in an area, are the ones that are most often kited.
Usually by subconscious habit, right through the more populated areas.</P>

<P>If you are a kiter, take responsibility for your actions. Adopt Darkpact's
5 rules of kiting (especially if your kiting guards).</P>

<P><B>Warn the young in your area your kiting.</B> Continue to do so about
every 1/2 hour.</P>

<P><B>Kite only in areas that the young are not hunting.</B> Meaning don't
kite towards a popular area in an attempt to get help. There too young.
They can't help. It's a miracle to hit, or not be resisted, by something
even just 5 levels higher, let alone to be able to do significant damage.</P>

<P><B>Be responsible for the pain and death you cause by your actions.</B>
If someone dies or is seriously wounded by your actions. Repair that damage.</P>

<P><B>Do not ever exceed 50-75 feet of lead line.</B> If you do you have
a very high chance of your target going astray and killing the young in
one round or less.</P>

<P><B>If necessary choose an escape option that does not endanger anyone.</B>
As example in Oasis if you trigger Specters on the island and can't handle
them, Gate (out of zone). Gating will cause them to be confused, they will
not rage on any of the young because all will be outside their rage range
(which by my calculation is a huge 150 or so feet, compared to the normal
30-50 of most creatures, this being exactly why the island exists). They
would simply move back to their natural positions after.</P>

<P>Remember whether you win or not, if anyone is hurt or dies from your
kiting, that's someone elses day your ruining. Remember it's not how long
that experience takes to gain, but the fact that because of your actions
someone else was injured or died.</P>

<P>It's not fun to get hurt, less to die, especially by someone elses actions.</P>

<P>Try and remember it's not just you that deserves to have a good day.
A responsible player earns the respect of the young and Honor for him/her-self.
This will someday come back to you. (And for those of you saying 'bah I'm
evil, I don't care', I refer you to the <A HREF="defevil.html">Definition
of Evil</A>. By ensuring the safety of the young you also put the subconscious
urge in their mind to like and aid you when needed.)</P>

<P>If you kite, be responsible.
