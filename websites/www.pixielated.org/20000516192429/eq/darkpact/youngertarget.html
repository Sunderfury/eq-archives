"3">The direction EQ is starting to take concerns me.</P>

<P>First we have an announcement of a movie. This worries me, as the game
is oriented towards teens and adults. I think a movie would try and broaden
the appeal, thus targeting a younger audience.</P>

<P>Today announced on EQ Vault, was a line of Action figures. This came
as no surprise to me. With a movie announcement action figures were not
far behind.</P>

<P>Reportedly EQ has become the most popular online game to date. At the
same time it is probably one of the most popular computer games to date,
period.</P>

<P>Why is this? I think it has to do with the freedom of the world. Someone
who's 10 years old can enjoy it just as much as someone who's 50. You are
free to explore the word, kill monsters, or be a stripper, it's up to you
how you wish to live your life.</P>

<P>Right now EQ is aimed at primarily a mid to late teen audience. One who
is starting to figure out their place in the world. I will be idealistic
and say their sexuality*, and can comprehend, reason, and type at a reasonable
pace to present themselves in a commonly understood fashion.</P>

<P>* = Idealistic because I know that sexuality is commonly being explored
in the young and pre-teen years these days.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>This is more just a personal rant than a solvable argument. I think with
the upcoming movie and action figures Verant is just going to hurt themselves
in the long run. I think they will harvest a younger, higher cycling audience,
and be forsaking the older more devoted crowd.</P>

<P>I'm not so much against lowering the age appeal in and of itself. What
I'm against is that I really don't think pre-teens should become more and
more a target audience for EQ. It will limit options, and worse its an audience
I don't think should really be exposed to the options of an adult world.</P>

<P>I think there should be blood, there should be more nudity in all the
models, give it more of an adult appeal and atmosphere. When the sky is
the limit, you should set your abilities there. If you can do something
of an adult nature, target that end, because that's how most will act if
allowed.</P>

<P>The forthcoming movie and action figures can only mean one thing - Lowering
of the target audience for EQ.</P>

<P>As a society, I don't think this is a good thing. This game is not just
a game, it's a world. If you target pre-teens they will not have the reading
/ typing comprehension, or understanding (aka street-smarts), to function
in the world. I'm not saying they can't (that it would be &quot;impossible&quot;).
I'm just saying that I think a younger audience than we have now just opens
up more abuse, and will get people into more fights due to the fact that
they don't understand each other and can't explain their positions well.</P>

<P>It's happened before. He-man / She-ra, GI-Joe, Dungeons &amp; Dragons
cartoon, Thundar the Barbarian, all 'worlds' which originally spawned for
audience target x, and wound up in the hands of a younger audience. A recent
example is Starship Troopers. A good 'cartoon' (it's really CG) but it really
doesn't relate the horrors of war and personal bonding that the movie did.</P>

<P>I don't know what will happen for sure, but I have a very strong feeling
that because of this EQ will have a split in the genera they have started.
I see the industry splitting in two. (Following the flow that the movie
industry is starting to create.)</P>

<P>On one side EQ will fall the wayside of a younger audience. Sure things
can still look cool, but they will never deal with more adult issues. It
will never become more realistic or complex. It will just be a mixture of
D&amp;D and Zelda. Less penalty and emotional stress, and an easier path
to achievement. (Example of lowered target audience - You can not use the
words Killed or Slain, you must instead use Defeated.)</P>

<P>On the other side will spawn the new games, darker, more adult, higher
conflict, with higher rewards which are more distressing / challenging to
attain. They will include nude models (at least more nude), and blood. They
will deal with more real issues. They will push your limits mentally.</P>

<P>Maybe it's just me, but I think that all this 'targeting to the youngest
audience' is not a good thing for the future of EQ.
