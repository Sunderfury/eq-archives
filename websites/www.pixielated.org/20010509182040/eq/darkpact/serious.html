"3">As I've spent more time in Kunark I'm discovering a disturbing trend.
More people are becoming more 'serious' about the game. There becoming more
tight lipped about what that new item is there holding. There keeping information
to themselves. They scream at you when you try and 'move in on their area'.
They use deception to take that rare spawn from someone else. They blame
others for things they themselves fail to control.</P>

<P>I know this sounds terrible. It sounds like people are hording everything
to themselves, becoming greedy power mongers. To a point this is true. But
I'm also noticing the opposite, several others are also becoming more relaxed.</P>

<P>There is the occasional ignore of a question about a new item. There
are the accusations of this or that at the zone line, or special rare spawn
point.</P>

<P>I don't know if it's so much that a higher percentage of players are
becoming more d00d-lik3 or if it's just a recent bad string I've run into.</P>

<P>I asked someone today, who is someone I know (in game), 'hey what's that
fancy Kunark shield you have'. I had asked about 2 or 3 others this same
question before and been flatly ignored. He told me, and there are some
nice stats on it, but it certainly will not kill on contact. He said 'hey
it's all about items, we are nothing without items'. I told him 'no were
not, we are who we are, naked or fully dressed'. He replied 'but without
items we have nearly the exact same stats, the same spells, we'd be carbon
copies', and while this is true, this does not mean we have the same psychological
makeup, we won't use those same spell combinations in that same way, we
won't use those same tactics. While it's true we would be more similar than
dissimilar, we are not totally ruled by our items.</P>

<P>Take today for example. I remember nearly each and every rez I did, of
which there were over a dozen. Also today someone gave me a rare no-drop
Kunarkian bracer with some nice stats. Which do I remember? The stats or
the resurrections? The latter, and how the people felt and their reactions.
The bracer will slightly affect Darkpact's life. The resurrections affect
mine, and the other players, the part of the equasion that truly matters
and lasts.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Remember, next time you go in world, again one of my biggest 'peeves'
if you will, you aren't kept here because of the items, your kept here by
your friends, the good times, and the fun you have sharing your time with
others.</P>

<P>Don't spoil it by being stingy about giving out information on items.
Don't spoil it by getting upset at someone else because they didn't follow
<B>your</B> rules. Don't spoil it by saying 'well I don't know that persion
in &quot;real life&quot; so I don't have to care'. Have fun, share your
knowledge and experiences. Help that stranger to also get that very cool
and fancy thing your holding. They will eventually, with or without your
help.</P>

<P>As I always say, when you shut down the computer and go to bed, it's
not the items you take with you, it's the feelings. Anger, hatred, greed,
stinginess; these are not things you should be taking to bed with you. In
this world, or any other.</P>

<P>&quot;Take care of yourselves, and each other...&quot;<BR>
