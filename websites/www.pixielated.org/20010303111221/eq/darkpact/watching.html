The call pulses through his veins.</P>

<P>Watching, waiting...<BR>
He is alone, felling nothing but pain.</P>

<P>The call of the night...<BR>
The hunger to feed.</P>

<P>Watching, waiting, alone.<BR>
He waits for her to bring him into the light.</P>

<P>At the end, he is alone.<BR>
The same sad story, as it is every night.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>As I return from a convention and cruising the parties, I'm reminded
just how painful I find it to be alone.</P>

<P>During the evening I was given a reminder from a drunken philosopher
named &quot;Kirk&quot;. He introduced himself and simply said &quot;Stop
watching. Enjoy yourself.&quot; and moved on.</P>

<P>Standing, watching, soloing as it were, I ponder the similarities in
life.</P>

<P>EQ helps us break down the barriers that we build up in the real world
and may have difficulty overcoming.</P>

<P>EQ is a fantasy. The people there are also a fantasy. However the people,
and feelings, behind the characters are very very real.</P>

<P>Remember, EQ can never replace what your missing in life, but it can
help you to understand what your really missing.</P>

<P>I just hope you have more luck finding what it is that your missing than
I.
