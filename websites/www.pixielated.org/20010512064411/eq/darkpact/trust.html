"3">Lately I've been pondering what it is about <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/"
TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A> that makes it special, unique, a bold step in
the genre.</P>

<P>I've also been pondering what it is about EQ that keeps us here, binds
us to it with so much good and bad emotional experiences.</P>

<P>I've come to one common conclusion about both: Trust.</P>

<P>It's really the basis for any game, relationship, meeting, in fact all
things in life. It's what compels and excites us. Will someone meet our
expectations that were trusting them with? Will they fail? Will they surpass
what we hope and dream that they will help us achieve? Will they lie and
cheat and break our trust entirely.</P>

<P>Trust is really the boundary all things share in common, but most importantly,
those which are most important to us.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>There are all kinds of dualities and balances in life. More often unspoken
than spoken, Trust binds them all.</P>

<P>The Trust in <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET=
"_blank">Vampire</A> between the Player and the Storyteller. Trusting the
Storyteller not to abuse the power and to take the Player somewhere they
want to go. Trusting the Player to enjoy themselves and help to improve
and evolve the story.</P>

<P>The Trust of a tank for their Cleric to heal them in EQ. The Trust of
the casters for the tanks to not go down and keep the enemy at bay. The
trust that when you do get that fancy new item no one will cheat you out
of your fair chance for it.</P>

<P>The Trust of a love for another. To open your heart and soul to them,
and for them to take care of you as you deserve, and to return the feelings
in kind.</P>

<P>Trust is a balance in all things. Remember that, and respect it.
