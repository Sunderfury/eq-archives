"3">This bad trade cost me to spend 8 hours on a Thursday, 10 Fri, 12 Sat,
8 Sun, constantly gaining / loosing experience to equal a zero gain.</P>

<P>To give those of you not familiar with me, which is the majority of you,
some background, I am a soloist. Over 90% of my life I have been soloing
here and there as I always seem to gain experience faster than were I grouped
in a big group.</P>

<P>A few weeks ago I had 'steeled out'. I had attained my goal of getting
enough plat to buy my Steel breast plate. I'm a very fashionable guy, I
was very happy. Since that day I had also bought the remaining steel I needed
to be in all steel but boots and gloves.</P>

<P>Late last Thursday night there was an auction. The first call I had ever
heard for this item. A Blood Stained Tunic. I knew what one was. I have
seen dozens of people wearing them, but never seen one for auction in Antonica,
and being Dark Elf, have never had the opportunity to go to their origin
(where I hear they sell at 1/2 cost).</P>

<P>I got excited, I thought 'cool at long last here is my chance'. But I
was out of plat. I had burnt it all out getting the steel. I love my steel
and look very good in it.</P>

<P>Due to some brain seizure, temporary insanity, whatever, I recalled the
steel breast being worth 500. I asked if the auctioned would trade for the
steel. He did so and I traded my Small Steel Breast for the BS Tunic.</P>

<P>I return to battle where I was soloing, proud in the new blood red tunic.
I immediately notice a difference. The lower AC caused me to get hit more
often for a higher amount, but I also seemed to hit at higher damage levels.
This was odd I thought, and decided to watch the outcome over the next few
battles.</P>

<P>The result was terrible. The lower AC, though it was only an actual 5
points (actual AC being the number listed in AC, not what the item says,
as item AC is often 1/2 of actual AC), I seemed to be doing much more poorly
on average.</P>

<P>I look to see if the traders name is still in my text window, but it's
long gone. All I have is a vague memory he was half elf, in some kind of
blue armor. (Could have been crafted, paladin, or bard).</P>

<P>Over the next hour I discover that my chances in general had been reduced
from 98% success chance, to about 75%. With the dual wielding guards it
had been reduced from 80% and 95% (depending on which guard it was) to 25%
and 50%.</P>

<P>I also at that time decided to double check the value and stats of the
Steel. I lacked the stats, but was very saddened to find it was not worth
500 as I recalled, but in fact 850.</P>

<P>I had lost several hours exp due to deaths at this point, and basically
lost over 400 plat in trade. As well as the self esteem of the pride that
came with being in that very nice looking Steel. What was worse, I had no
record to make the trade back.</P>

<P>I was heart broken, but knew that most of the battle is in your mind.
Pay extreme attention, fight smart, and you can do better. Over the course
of the next 24 game hours I found this was not the case. I would be at my
very extreme best and still loose once every 4-8 hours, loosing hours upon
hours of experience evening out at a zero gain.</P>

<P>Since then I have repurchased a Bronze chest (done late Sunday night).
Which has the same AC, but different weight and look than the steel. At
this point I have had a steady gain of 8 hrs exp, and finish the battles
with 2x hp and mana as I did with the BS.</P>

<P>I have lost pride, 400 plat, and nearly an entire weeks gaming, due to
my bad trade.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>The simple fact is I made a bad trade for me, at this point in time.
At any other point in time, the 5 AC probably wouldn't have made as big
a difference, but right now it cost me to basically stop gaining experience
until I replaced the lost steel with bronze.</P>

<P><B>Suggestions-</B></P>

<P>Never trade anything your currently using. I tried another purchase before
which didn't work out, but I still had the old item. It was easy enough
to simply switch back and sell the item which didn't work out.</P>

<P>If your not sure how the item will work out, ask the person if you can
have a 'trial period' where you write down their name and if it doesn't
work out if it would be ok to trade back. Say within 1 weeks real time or
something. This will protect both sides of the trade. But this will also
depend on the honor of the person to follow this agreement.</P>

<P>Be sure you know the value of what your are trading and receiving. Write
down what you paid for an item and what it's value is. Be sure to know that
it is a fair trade, don't go from memory, it may be late, you may suffer
a temporary laps as I did, always check your figures.</P>

<P>Don't try and let a bad trade get you down. There are always tough times
in life, try and accept it, change to fix the situation, and move on. This
one will take me a long time to recover from, as the difference in plat
is not easy to come by, but I will regain the experience, in fact I already
have. I will gain new / better items.</P>

<P>Above all this is just a game. In real life things like this would be
tragic, but this just being a game, well, just try to accept the bad times
as a life experience and move on. Live and learn. Even the bad things have
something to teach.
