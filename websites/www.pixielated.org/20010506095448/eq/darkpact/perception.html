"3">What are these strange preconceptions we have that we can't seem to
break? We know this is a game, we know the rules are different in Norrath
than on Earth. Yet unless we try very hard we will still follow the patterns
of the traits we learned on Earth.</P>

<P>&quot;It begins to rain.&quot;</P>

<P>What comes to mind when you hear this, see the lightning, hear the thunder,
see the rain begin to fall, and now for those of us who can push the view
to the limit, that incoming wall of obscured vision? For me, though I love
rain on earth. But in Norrath, it means I feel a little sad. I know my helmet
is getting rained on, my steel will get rusty, my face wet. I want to find
shelter and stay under it. Yet at the same time, I also know the rain is
only perceived. It will have no effect on myself or my equipment. In fact
I don't really exist at all, there is nothing to get wet.</P>

<P>Another example; the other day where I am hunting I told a low, who it
obviously was not his first life, that staying in the guardhouse provided
no protection, as the monsters can run right through it. His response, &quot;Oh
I know. But it makes me feel safer.&quot;</P>

<P>I think we all have these feelings.</P>

<P>EQ has 3 of the 5 senses represented. Those being, Sight, Sound, and
Touch, all in a 3d world. This is the closest anyone has come so far to
creating a virtual, fully interactive, world. And they have. And in a lot
of ways succeeded brilliantly.</P>

<P>(Those who believe in the 6 th really doesn't count because it's still
used and represented.)</P>

<P>Why is it that having my Steel armor makes me feel mighty? That the thought
of getting that 2hd Slashing weapon for Pal / Cleric would make me close
to those avenging angels the Catholics depict? (no I'm not Catholic)</P>

<P>Why is it that when a weapon is 2 handed we presume it will be better
than 1?</P>

<P>The reality of these things is that they are not always the case.</P>

<P>Buildings provide no solace, as monsters run right through.</P>

<P>2 handed items are not necessarily more efficient than 1 handed.</P>

<P>Steel is actually better, I loose the argument on that one ;&gt; But
what is not is the feeling of Pride, Power, and nigh-Invulnerability I get
from having such. (Though upon reaching 50 I'd love to get wings and have
a halo as a light source =D but that gets into my morph the characters beyond
50 th lv into a new class debate).</P>

<P>These are all perceptual things our mind gives us.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Sadly at my current level of knowledge in Psychology I can't offer any
reasons why we have these preconceptions and feelings. Why we feel the urge
to get out of the rain, why we feel more empowered by a good looking item
than one which may not look as good but have a better result, or that isn't
shown on our character.</P>

<P>Just thought I'd point out that the mind is an interesting thing, and
as we explore these other worlds which hold no danger and different rules,
it's interesting to watch how we react.
