<P>You, ageless as time itself<BR>
We, created from your will</P>

<P>Created from injustice<BR>
Created from hate<BR>
Created from anger<BR>
Created from twisting that which was<BR>
To serve you and your own will</P>

<P>We struggle to kill in your name<BR>
Fight for battlegrounds<BR>
Competing with the others<BR>
Forced to join them to serve our needs<BR>
Forced to join them to fulfill your will</P>

<P>We are your children<BR>
We the Teir'Dal<BR>
We, called the Dark Elves<BR>
Forced down by their expansion and numbers<BR>
Forced to use their tools as we lack our own</P>

<P>Overflowing is our heart, mind and soul<BR>
Of hate and rage<BR>
Of injustice and unfairness<BR>
We have need to lash out<BR>
Need to take what is rightfully ours</P>

<P>We call to you<BR>
You who created us<BR>
Created from injustice, hate and rage<BR>
We call your name<BR>
We prey and beseech you will hear</P>

<P>Hear our words<BR>
Know our heart and soul<BR>
Fill our hands<BR>
With that which we need<BR>
Give to us that which only we can use</P>

<P>We need the tools<BR>
We need the way<BR>
Our minds, hearts and soul<BR>
Already full of your will<BR>
Yet our hands empty</P>

<P>You, ignore the children you created to carry out your will<BR>
We, wait, and suffer the same injustice that influenced you to create us<BR>
Being ignored and forgotten...</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>We the evil races are ignored. We have little to no equipment to specifically
call our own. Especially those who's classes can be the same as the good.
I think many souls are lost to good lives because they can not bear the
constant punishment we receive.</P>

<P>The goods have ruined their own lands... and now ruin ours. They take
our dungeons, walk in our cities, and are generating new equipment all the
time.</P>

<P>Let us prey all our (evil) gods hear our words, and answer our call soon.
