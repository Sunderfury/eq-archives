"3">I've been doing Hate pretty steadily for about a month now. I've gone
maybe once or twice a week. School is starting up now, so I'll be lucky
if I can get up there once a week.</P>

<P>On our server we have a lot of high level people. When I started going
up to Hate the loot was fairly civilized. There was very little arguments,
personal honor was fairly high, and people rarely had bad or sad feelings
when leaving.</P>

<P>Recently there has been an attempt to organize Clerics going to Hate
as a whole. To try and sort out some final loot rules and get things formalized
as to what is what. This has stirred up a lot of feelings on all sides.</P>

<P>However, this reminds me of something I've been observing, and mentioned
in another post, <A HREF="defevil.html">&quot;The Definition of Evil&quot;</A>.</P>

<P>I am basically the only current DE Cleric who is vocalizing my opinions
on the board. I'm getting accused of working and arguing only for myself
and my points sometimes invalid as I did x, y, or z so many months ago.
I often think that this is because I'm 'evil'.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>I find it intriguing that because I'm 'evil' and thus show the world
my view, opinions and feelings freely, without fluffing them up, without
kissing their ass, without being super polite, that this is returned with
Hate. Hate begets Hate I always say.</P>

<P>I've been watching over the course of my life, more and more in the higher
levels, that those who are of 'evil' races have a higher resistance to the
'negative' emotions, hate, rage, anger, lower reactions to things done wrong
that were mistaken in some way. It seems we, who are of the dark races,
have a much higher resistance to hate than others.</P>

<P>I don't necessarily find it odd that we do. I don't necessarily find
it odd that those who are of 'good' race expect us to be kind, polite, and
kiss everyone's ass.</P>

<P>What I do find most intriguing is that the 'goods' don't see how quickly
they can become greedy, hateful, spiteful.</P>

<P>Just another observation that seems intriguing to me. 'Evil', oppressed,
hated, loners who stay back in shadow, are the ones who are used to the
situations. They view things more fairly and fight back that much harder
when they see something off, or unjust.</P>

<P>I suppose, those of us who do live this kind of life in the 'real world'
are drawn to these races, and thus play them well, as we wear our feelings
plainly and proudly for all to see, we need not validate our feelings in
any way other than we are who we are.</P>

<P>Interesting that those who are of the 'more beautiful' races are always
the ones who loose the fights so quickly to Hate. Ah Innoruuk, there so
easily turned.
