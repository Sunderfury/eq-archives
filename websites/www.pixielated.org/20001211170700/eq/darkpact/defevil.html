"3">In this article I will talk a bit about Good and Evil. Not really anything
having to do with the game, but the general idea itself, the preconceptions
and the misconceptions. It will prove how most of the goods are more evil,
by the commonly understood definition, than I.</P>

<P><B>Common perceptions of what most call evil actions:</B></P>

<P>Murder of Innocents<BR>
Greed<BR>
Deception used in order to further personal goals<BR>
Kill stealing<BR>
Camping<BR>
Doing something for your own personal gain<BR>
Using, or manipulating someone, physically or mentally to your benefit<BR>
Expansionism which involves conquest by power</P>

<P><B>Murder of Innocents, Expansionism</B><BR>
I have seen for a number of months now, the continuing slaughter of guards
in the evil lands. This is, more often than not, done solely by good races.
I have heard that this has now expanded other areas, most notably the Watchmen
in Steamfont (poor Halv). These guards, who are in place only to protect
the young, are lured one at a time to die by the hands of those usually
40 th +. Goods now killing goods, shameful. This combines with the next
issues.</P>

<P><B>Greed, Doing something for your own personal gain</B><BR>
These high levels do have places they can go, things they can kill to gain
experience. I'm not that high myself yet, only just now hitting 33 rd, however,
I know there are places and things they can hunt besides guards. This is
just plain greed. They want an easy kill, and they want to do it without
having to depend on a high number of others to help them gain.</P>

<P>Another example is, on my server, probably others; at the Treants in
South Karana there is a list to be allowed to hunt there. Nothing more than
greed causes this list to remain in effect. If there were a rotation, all
getting a fair share, this list would not exist. People would get enough
experience by sharing or move on. Simple greed keeps this list active.</P>

<P><B>Kill Stealing, Camping</B><BR>
Nowhere in the world have I seen so much kill stealing and camping as I
have in Highpass Hold. Granted I don't do dungeons, so I've never seen cazic
thule, lower guk, or what was the rubisite. Kill stealing and camping/harvesting
have more to do with greed and personal gain than anything else does.</P>

<P><B>Deception</B><BR>
Guise of the deceiver, lying about a spawn point or time for a quest item.
Just two examples of what some 'power gamers' may resort to. Goods can,
and sometimes do, deceive to gain access or items, on an ever-increasing
need to have the biggest most powerful thing, and with the free access,
what is there to stop them but other players.</P>

<P>&quot;But&quot;, you say, &quot;all you have done so far is blur the
line between good and evil by showing our actions can be construed as good
or evil. What then is the 'definition of evil'?&quot;</P>

<P><B>For the true definition of evil we must look to the &quot;psychology
of evil&quot;.</B> That which are the subconscious preconceptions of how
someone of an evil race will act, or how a good will act or react to them.</P>

<P><B>Evil has a higher sense of self-preservation, and avoidance of death.</B><BR>
So much higher than good races that they will not engage, or continue, a
battle that they can not win. While a good may have an attitude of 'well
if I start to loose, I can always train this to the zone', a character of
evil race will consider before the battle 'can I win this, can I win this
if x, y, and z happen'. And when they loose they will more often resort
to an escape tactic (gate or teleport), or simply accept death, instead
of training to the zone line. I have seen more evils take the fall while
companions escaped than I have good paladins or warriors.</P>

<P><B>Evil may save your life or give you aid when seemingly unnecessary.</B><BR>
This may not seem readily apparent, and is certainly not expected, but what
does someone have to gain by your death? If they save / prolong your life,
you will be very surprised and pleased. So much so you in turn will more
than likely feel indebted to them, be it on a conscious level or simply
subconsciously. You may offer help, now or later, you will be influenced
subconsciously when hearing they are in trouble to return the favor. This
then is not a selfless act to save your life, but more an investment in
the future.</P>

<P>I myself have often buffed / helped / healed lows. Some have sworn their
lives to me, promising anything. A dwarf swore one day to repay me, not
knowing how or when, but that he would. Most often I find people recognize
me several levels after I did what they considered a 'selfless act', hail
me just to say hi, or come up to me and offer assistance, or cast on me
in a return of the long past favor.</P>

<P>Why wouldn't a character of evil race save you? What do they genuinely
have to gain by letting you die? If they save you, you feel indebted to
them. If they let you die, and you discover they could have helped, you
would not help them in the future when they in turn need it. It's here that
double standards and confusions most often occur about what is good and
what evil.</P>

<P><B>Good will often blame you for their death.</B><BR>
If you are near by and don't help, goods will sometimes blame any other
goods they can, who they perceived could have helped, for their death, or
misfortune. An evil character will rarely, if ever, be blamed for not helping.
This has to do with the subconscious preconception that evil races are selfish,
and would not have helped. Where good races are supposed to help, even expected,
often even if it would mean their own lives.</P>

<P><B>Evil is not expected to give things, or aid, away.</B><BR>
As a good cleric I was constantly asked for heals, cures and buffs, and
felt obligated to give them. I never had mana for myself, and despite the
exp loss for death at the time, I was leveling extremely slowly. As evil,
my needs and desires come first. If I'm hunting why should I help you if
your not in my group? My mana is mine to do with as I choose being evil.
Of course you will probably be given the help, but subconsciously you don't
expect it.</P>

<P><B>Evil is less likely to compete for an item.</B><BR>
Evil races tend not to do quests or compete for items. This is primarily
due to the difficulty to venture to such a place, however it is also in
great part due to the high level of competition and stress involved. Good
players outnumber Evil probably somewhere on the ratio of around 50-1, maybe
more. Thus if I wanted item x, designed for Clerics, Shaman and Druids,
I as a singular Dark Elf Cleric, would have to compete with 50 other players
to get it. We are therefore limited in quests we can accomplish, and in
competition to put up bids in auction. More often than not, we simply don't
bother.</P>

<P><B>Evil does not mean dishonorable.</B><BR>
Simply because someone is of an evil race and above things are all in effect
does not mean they do not have honor. In fact it is more often the exact
opposite. Because evil races see so little go in their favor, they are usually
more understanding to people's plight when they are having a hard time.
I myself have gotten into several matches over honor and fairness. In highpass
between the levels of 17 th and 23 rd I convinced players, on several occasions,
to share all spawns. Not to claim a side, particular spawn, or a number,
but to be fair to all, and make a rotation between all groups and hunters
in the area.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Evil in EQ means more a member of a race who is more to themselves, selfish,
or withdrawn. Nothing more.</P>

<P>Do not discard those of evil races, for they may be a more faithful and
honorable companion than you will ever meet.</P>

<P>Expect nothing, offer everything, and you may be surprised at what you
will gain in return.</P>

<P>Understand we, as an evil race, are oppressed by the world, that does
not mean we are oppressive in return.
