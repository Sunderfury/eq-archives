<P><IMG SRC="darkpact.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="288" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>When the sun set's tomorrow, it will open up a <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/"
TARGET="_blank">World of Darkness</A>. This new world will be very different
from Norrath. The <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET=
"_blank">Vampire</A> game set's to change and evolve the genre from one
of 'hack and slash' or 'kill, rest, repeat' to one of character development
and high role playing.</P>

<P>The world of <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET=
"_blank">Vampire</A> is a very flushed out one. Far more so than EQ. While
EQ took their basis from D&amp;D, they took it from a much broader base
than the <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>
world is set in. In essence, EQ tried too do too much, too quickly. There
is no real defining society of each of the races in Norrath. Sure they have
slightly different architecture, does that really mean anything? No. They
all say the same things in each bank, each armor vendor, etc. Is Kunark
really any different than the original EQ release? No. They still claim
you have ruined your own land and you'll not ruin theirs.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>
game sets to evolve the genre in that it is &quot;Story&quot; based. That
meaning each 'game' has a set beginning, a path it follows, and an end.
Unlike EQ where you just run around and camp monster x and kill it over
and over repeatedly. (They are somewhat unclear on this and other aspects
of the multi-player games.) The thrust of <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/"
TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A> is based around the characters, how they interact,
and the society that has evolved around the <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/"
TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A> myths. There is no comparison in EQ. Sure there
are guilds in EQ, but these guilds are nothing compared to the hidden societies
of <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>
promises to be full of mystery, intrigue, character exploration, and character
evolution. There is a &quot;storyteller&quot; who can join the game and
allow players to do logical, but non-pre-scripted things. An example the
site gives is that a player breaks off a leg of a table and uses it as a
stake. The world is not built to compensate for that, however through the
power of someone being the &quot;storyteller&quot; they can make the table
appear broken, and supply the player with a stake, and thus the action took
place.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>
shows extreme promise in that it will be of 'high role playing' caliber,
unlike EQ which has little to no role playing aspects at all. But being
so player driven will it actually live up to it's potential, or will the
players be d00ds and drop the ball as it were? Will players make good &quot;Stories&quot;
or will it be 'you walk into a bar, get in a fight, kill the vampire lord,
and the game is over, you get c00l l3wt 3, and 5000 experience'?</P>

<P>The potential for <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/"
TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A> to be so much more is there, the first evolution
into a true role playing experience. Will the players make the game succeed
with great success? Will the game makers supply enough new material to keep
it as interesting as Verant has done with EQ.</P>

<P>Certainly so far the fan base is eager, ready and willing, to make it
a success. Already several fan based sites are growing following the original
high role playing myths and stories the original pen and paper evolved.</P>

<P>Is <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>
for everyone? Certainly not. I expect maybe less than 5% of EQ players will
even try <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>.
I know of all my friends, who mind you were all at one time hardcore pen
and paper gamers, I am the only one who pre-bought <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/"
TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>. I am the only one who is not hooked on EQ so
much to take a 'I'll wait and see' attitude towards it.</P>

<P>For me, gaming in EQ was always an attempt to role play. However, with
the 'failure' of the expansion in my eyes, I know that potential will never
be reached. EQ is much as D&amp;D was to me when it first was beginning
back when I was around 10-12. You make a character, you make a few stats
straight 18 00s, you blow through monsters and gain loot x. Later in life,
as the pen and paper gaming genre evolved, I found it was much more interesting
to cause a character a psychological trauma or victory, over one of loot.
It was more fun to describe in detail how that surprise orc band mangled
their comrade, and taunted them with it, to watch their character 'loose
it' after so many adventures of being together.</P>

<P>For most people this is a matter of wiring. Do they want the intellectual
gain, or the virtual stuff / quick non-stress gain.</P>

<P>If <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>
is half of what it promises, my time in the world of Norrath will drop to
next to nil.</P>

<P>Will <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/" TARGET="_blank">Vampire</A>
succeed at being the first high role playing on line experience? The setting
of tomorrows sun will tell. Will the moon welcome you to a <A HREF="http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/"
TARGET="_blank">World of Darkness</A>? or just another way to get c00l l3wt?</P>

<P>In anticipation and excitement at the new world, I've started a site, On a Shadowed Hill. In the event I do switch to it enough that there will no longer appear any rant's here, fear not I will post it.</P>
		<P>Welcome to the night, tomorrow your world changes...</P>
