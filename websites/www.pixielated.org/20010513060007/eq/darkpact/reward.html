"3">As I find myself nearing 50 th several things are happening.</P>

<P>I've always had the ideal of going from my mostly all steel look (fashionable
much?) to my 'fabulous' purple (I have to call it that because the color
is a bit silly sometimes).</P>

<P>Though now, after quite a bit of research as I have gotten closer to
the 46 th level door pass, that acquiring it all won't be an easy task.
In fact I've heard several confirmations that whenever you enter a plain,
to walk out with all your stuff, you will suffer between 6 and 12 deaths.
50 ths are happy to walk in with a full bar of experience and walk out still
being 50 th.</P>

<P>I have asked 3 different people in full 'fear gear' as I nickname it,
and gotten about the same answer from all. For each 8 hour period spent
in a plain you can expect your group to receive a single piece of special
equipment.</P>

<P>Hum. So much for my hopes of hitting 50 th spending some time there and
getting all my gear. I was guessing about 24 game hours, the equivalent
of one level. But it seems for full gear that figure will have to be closer
to 200 hours (roughly 24 x 8)</P>

<P>When I was younger, I had thought that by 50 th I would have all the
regular items I wanted and be moving on to my 'fear gear'.</P>

<P>I'm still many pieces short at nearing 1 bub into 45 th. I am missing
a belt, back, Mithril Tunic (or Chest), and highest on my list, the Efreeti
boots. Just 4 items short of my goal, but at my current rate I highly doubt
I will attain them before I max out 50 th.</P>

<P>So I'm wondering, where is the great reward for hitting 50 th?</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>I'm finding out there is no great reward coming my way.</P>

<P>I'm only becoming more and more reinforced in my already understanding
that the reward isn't at the end, isn't in the attaining of the items, but
in the journey, the living of the life.</P>

<P>As I'm deciding to hold 'service' for a part of my weekend days, I'm
finding there lies the reward. In the making of others happy. Try it sometime.
Buff or help out a low, see the reward you get. Compare that to the 15 minutes
of exp gain you'd get in a dungeon (especially on the weekend). I think
you'll find the reward higher (especially if your past 40 th lv).</P>

<P>What great reward is there? Was it just me, or when the plains were announced
did not Verant themselves say &quot;they wanted to give back something to
the players who reached 50 th&quot;? From what I've heard all you get for
going in is about 10 deaths, and maybe if your very, very lucky, a singular
member in your group will gain a single item during your gaming session.</P>

<P>Where is the reward?</P>

<P>To me a reward is not given on conditions, it's given period. If the
plains and items on them a reward, you should be able to have all your 'fear
gear' in under a 24 hour session. After all, I've heard every single plain
item is no drop. They attained the level to enter and survived. Why not
give them the reward?</P>

<P>Pass on Verants virtual reward of items. I've heard there too hard to
obtain. Instead take it at any level you choose, in the joy of living this
other life, and in the enrichment of others.
