"3">I have lead a rather different set of 12 previous lives. In the first
I used to dungeon a lot, each life I have progressively dungeoned less and
less, until my current. In my current life I've spent maybe 2 hours in dungeons
total.</P>

<P>I already had a previous dislike of dungeons as the rule seems to be
within 30 minutes of entering I seem to always die and loose at least 4
hours of experience.</P>

<P>This last experience tops them all. In an attempt to gain experience
to up my Alteration Specialization over the 50 mark (see accompanying rant
'How I wasted 24 game hours on Specialize') I decided to move from South
Karana, where grouping is more by friend than chance, to try Cazac Thule.
First know in this life it had been approximately 6 levels since I last
stepped foot in a dungeon. During that experience I went into bellfallen
(at lv 25) waltzed right to the bottom, everything was green, until the
blues which nearly killed me in 30 seconds flat. I decided to leave.</P>

<P>But this experience tops them all. I leave Oggok and walk on over towards
Cazac. I say a hello to Hurd on my way, and pass the familiar outter pyramids,
bringing memories back to the youth of several lives. I get to the entrance
and lo and behold, there are probably a dozen or so sitting outside. 'Great',
I think, 'lots to heal to try and get up my skill, maybe even find a group'.
By the time I had checked three people for wounds, here come to specters
chasing someone, thwack, thwack, they start mowing people down, some try
and fight, but as I seem to be one of the highs, most quickly die or zone.
I zone in saying, damn they were still red (I found others in Oasis are
yellow). I make it in to Cazac and have time to cast one heal and prepare
to sit down, now down to only 3 bubbles and nearly oom. Here come some low
blue lizzies. Ok, maybe I can take one or two and then rest up. Well gee,
here are 2 more, lets hope that the specters are dead or gone now. Zone
back out. Thwack, Thwack, nope, more health gone. Zone back in, as I stand
a much better chance with the lizzies. I get in, and try to gate. Phew.
I made the gate. Thank Innoruk the lizzies were low blue and for the most
part miss me.</P>

<P>And so, in under 1 minute of game time, I hadn't even willingly entered
the dungeon yet, and THWACK! 855 hp chopped off me. Damn lucky I had both
buffs on that kick me up to 860. Yes, I escaped from 2 trains with under
5 hp life.</P>

<P>Point of the rant: Most players are idiots. Panic and a greed to survive
and not loose exp cause them to train and kill others, sometimes several
others, in there panic to escape. If there were some way to train the masses
on group tactics and how not to panic we'd be fine. But somehow I doubt
that will happen without a guild to teach such knowledge regularly.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Unfortunately people are idiots, panic, and have little to no tactical
training. There really is no solution but to find a good group if you do
plan on dungeoning, and staying far away from the zone line.
