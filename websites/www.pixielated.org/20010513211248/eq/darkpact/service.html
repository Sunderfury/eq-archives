"3">Perhaps this is a novel concept, or maybe there are just too few on
at any given time to perceive this as a common occurrence.</P>

<P>On occasion I have been 'holding service' in various places. By 'holding
service' I mean doing things for 'free' with 'no apparent' benefit. Healing,
Buffing, in my case Resurrecting, and so on.</P>

<P>As I find myself approaching 50 th, and the server becomes more and more
crowded, reducing my already few choices of hunting grounds, I am more and
more inclined to hold service. I will not say where or when, simply that
it is often in an area around 10 - 25 th level, and always on a weekend
day.</P>

<P>Recently a friend who plays a druid held service while on a quest with
a rare spawn, and had a lot of fun doing so.</P>

<P>I find myself wondering if others are holding service as well.</P>

<P>You can hold service in any area, on any given day. Sometimes it's in
a zone much lower. Others, like last night, when a zone (in this case Sol
B) has emptied below it's safe minimum and people forget to pay attention
and start needing body retrieval and resurrections.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>There seems to be a lot of greed rampant, and a lot of power leveling.
While some would accuse me of power leveling, as I seem to gain levels much
quicker than others (I think this is due to the fact I always seek exp over
items), I do spend a lot of time 'helping others'. I am beginning to wonder
if I do so more than others.</P>

<P>Personally, when I get them, I'd like to start the trend of wearing the
Seeker Robes (a nice easily seen bright red) to denote that I'm holding
service at that time. Of course I'd do the occasional shout of 'Holding
service at x'. Currently those shouts must also include '(healing, buffing,
rezing, etc)'.</P>

<P>Ideally I'd like to see more healers holding service. I'd like the term
'holding service' to be much more readily understood than it is commonly.
I'd like, instead of getting tells from 5+ zones away, to hear people shout
'is anyone holding service and can help me?'.</P>

<P>I'd like those receiving help to understand the person holding service
only has a limited mana supply and must hold the balance of giving to all
in mind when giving to you. But of course your always free to ask for specifics.</P>

<P>Who knows, someday I may have to change my shout to become specific due
to other competition 'Priest of Innoruuk holding service for dark races,
and all women' *shrug*</P>

<P>Of course, donations are always appreciated, especially clarity, and
often sow (to chase after the things too big the young may be running from).</P>

<P>PS- To anyone who finds this not in character for a Dark Elf, you couldn't
be more wrong. Each person I hold service for has a piece of their soul
forever taken and corrupted. The more I aid, the more I harvest to aid me
in the future. I point you to The Definition of Evil.
