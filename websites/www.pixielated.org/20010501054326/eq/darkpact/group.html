<H3><CENTER>Darkpact Wrathful - 12 / 8 / 99</CENTER></H3>

<P><IMG SRC="darkpact.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="288" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">In all of my time spent playing EQ I have been in a very wide range
of groups in their level of effectiveness. It seems most don't consider
Tactics, they just do their thing and if it winds up working in the group
it's more due to random coincidence than actual Tactics and Strategy.</P>

<P>Being the leader and protector I am by my very nature, there are a few
groups I have pounded into shape from ok, to become very effective, and
others that were just asking for death, which I left. (I could also do the
same in Tribes, take a loosing group and if they followed orders, turn them
into a force to be reckoned with.)</P>

<P>It seems most seem to lack the basic understanding of the roles of everyone
involved, and inherent with that they can't work effectively in the group.
Thus I offer my understanding and suggestions.</P>

<P>This will be broken into three groups. <A HREF="#section1">The first
by general role</A>, these can be assumed by any class player. <A HREF=
"#section2">Second by class specific role</A>, that role which a character
of that class should be doing. Third a section on <A HREF="#section3">group
selection and general tactics</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section1"></A>Section 1: General Roles</H3>

<P><B>Leader</B></P>

<P>The leader should make <B>all</B> the decisions. He/She should consider
the well being of the group at all times. In this he/she should know the
area well enough to select a hunting ground which their current group is
capable of holding without risk. They should also know the risks of the
surrounding areas, such as will a monster from camp x over run them, and
if so, can they handle it, will group y train and can we handle that.</P>

<P>It is also the leaders role to assign the other roles to the participants
if they do not already understand their role.</P>

<P>Leaders must also enforce / remind players of others capabilities / inadequacies
if they are expecting too much or doing something wrong.</P>

<P>Leaders should make decisions on who to add / drop in the group.</P>

<P><B>Primary Burner</B></P>

<P>It is the role of the primary burner to lay waste to everything that
comes into the group they possibly can as fast as possible. Primary burners
can often run into trouble by getting mobbed. Only they can learn how to
avoid this. If mobbed it's the primary burners role to call which target
is most dangerous if they are given time. Often they go down to quick to
say little more than 'help. get it off me'.</P>

<P><B>Secondary Burner</B></P>

<P>It's the role of the secondary burner to backup the primary. They best
accomplish this by watching their primary task and occasionally throwing
in some ranged damage. The main concern of the secondary burner is to do
enough damage to keep the monsters from swarming the primary burner, confuse
the opponent with damage sources.</P>

<P><B>Primary Healer</B></P>

<P>It is the roll of the primary healer to sit back and watch the battle,
healing when necessary. The concern of the primary healer is to keep the
group healthy and buffed (for damage prevention). They should know what
resistance's need to be used in this area vs these monsters. It's their
duty to command the secondary healers if there are any. They should inform
the Tank when not to pull if the group is too hurt.</P>

<P>The primary healers main concern is health and prevention of life loss.
They <B>must</B> have the ability and trust to control these factors. If
their judgment or trust by the other players is compromised they can not
perform their duties properly.</P>

<P><B>Secondary Healer</B></P>

<P>It is the role of secondary healer to heal outside of combat, or during
if the primary healer is oom or healing someone else. It's ok for secondaries
to panic and heal too soon, however secondaries should wait for instructions,
or an ok from the primary, as the primary may be mid cast of a very large
mana draining spell.</P>

<P><B>Tank</B></P>

<P>The role of the tank is to keep killing targets. The tank needs to keep
all targets off the burners and the healers. Tanks have little to worry
about. Kill when fighting, keep watch when not.</P>

<P>Tanks must remember that the casters ability to do damage or heal, is
in their ability to cast. If their hit too hard, they will be interrupted
and unable to cast. Watch out for secondary targets distracting the casters
when fighting, give em one or two quick whacks and taunts to get them off
the caster, then move back to your primary target.</P>

<P><B>Puller</B></P>

<P>The puller should know an area well. What they can get, what their group
is capable of, what level of mana all have. They need to know where all
spawn points are in order to prevent a train. They need to have an escape
or know the zone lines in case they do train, so they don't train the group
with something they are not capable of defeating. They <B>must</B> call
incoming targets, and be aware of who is ready, and who is not (or afk).</P>

<P>It's paramount the puller report an accurate number and type of incoming
monster, so targets may be called before the puller arrives if necessary.
<B>Calling targets and concentrating fire is the key to a successful group.</B></P>

<P>A lot of group deaths are caused by a puller pulling too often (not enough
med time), too much (too many targets), or accidentally training the party.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section2"></A>Section 2: Class Specific Roles</H3>

<P><B>Bard</B></P>

<P>Bards are good for a general use secondary role. They can pretty much
do anything, heal, harm, slow down targets. It's hard to put the Bard into
any one single category. People typically define Bards as a 'support' class,
that being they kind of fill in where a role is needed.</P>

<P>The bards become invaluable at higher levels due to their ability to
sing the mana song. This reduces all casters recovery time (by my calculation)
of approximately half.</P>

<P><B>Cleric</B></P>

<P>Clerics are best suited for Primary Healer / Secondary Burner roles.
<B>From 34 th on their healing ability is unmatched</B> (Superior heal starting
at 600 hp, Complete heal fully healing players, a LoH which is mana based,
various resurrection abilities). Their ability to damage is also equal to
that of the wizard (so reported on the official boards). These damage spells
can be resisted and so it's not good to give a Cleric the role of primary
burner, even though they excel at battling undead.</P>

<P>Remember keeping a Cleric low on mana is only asking for death.</P>

<P>Clerics are inclined to also be leaders as they inherently are used to
watching the group and knowing the strengths / weaknesses of all.</P>

<P><B>Druids</B></P>

<P>Druids are good for a Secondary Healer / Secondary Burner role. They
have lots of decent abilities on both sides and when a situation gets bad
(after 29 th) they can evacuate the party.</P>

<P>(Submission by high level Druids would be appreciated to further understand
/ define their role)</P>

<P><B>Enchanter</B></P>

<P>I've known very few enchanters in my life, but I've heard they are a
general purpose role. I have heard the tactic for Enchanters is to be a
'distracting influence' on the monsters, using memory blurs, blinding, charming,
or otherwise confusing the targets.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Addition 1 / 17 / 00</FONT></B> - This was submitted
to me as a good resource. I only briefly glanced at the page but it looks
like there may be other descriptions here as well... <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/playguides/enchanter/view.asp?Strat_id=468">http://eq.castersrealm.com/playguides/enchanter/view.asp?Strat_id=468</A></P>

<P><B>Monk</B></P>

<P>Monks are good as Tanks (and Pullers). They have good fighting abilities
and if things get bad on a pull they can feign death (this was much better
before it was tweaked). Monks also make good leaders as their ability to
feign death makes them more concerned with how others may escape, keeping
preservation ever-present in their minds.</P>

<P><B>Necromancer / Wizard</B></P>

<P>These classes are best suited for Primary Burner. Their soft skinned
nature and low attack / ac makes them really unsuited for any other role.
However, as burners they highly excel. In dungeons these classes often group,
but in the wilderness you more often see them solo, or with very few partners.</P>

<P><B>Paladin</B></P>

<P>Paladins are best suited for a Tank / Secondary Healer role. They can
do damage, taunt monsters off of casters, pull, and have small healing abilities.
Their LoH can be a very good saving grace among a group when the Primary
healer is oom or going down. The Paladin healing is best used out of combat,
as the higher you go the more insignificant this healing becomes in combat.</P>

<P><B>Shadow Knight</B></P>

<P>Shadow Knights are best suited for a Tank / Secondary Burner role. They
can do damage as well as blast / slow down the monsters you are fighting.
Their harm touch can also be useful in finishing off something quickly when
unexpected targets arrive that may cause more problems than there are already.</P>

<P><B>Shaman</B></P>

<P>Shaman are good as Secondary burner / Secondary Healers. They have lots
of decent abilities on both sides.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Sent in via submission -</FONT></B> I'm not
yet a high-level Shaman (low 20s), but I do know the main use of a Shaman.
Our job is to make it so that the other members of our party can do their
jobs better. By buffing our group members and debuffing the MOBs, we can
attempt to minimize the damage our teammates take, while helping make sure
that the MOBs die as fast (and with as little mana expended) as possible.
We are also a flex role, of course. If there's a crack in the balance of
the group (not enough nuking, healing, or tanking power) we can -- to some
degree -- fill it. We're better at healing than nuking, though, and we don't
dare try to tank a harder MOB without a healer. Pets change this, somewhat,
I hear.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Addition 1 / 4 / 00 -</FONT></B> From what I've
seen of higher level Shaman, this doesn't change much. Of course after 34
th, none can compare to the healing power of the Cleric, and all other healers
become secondary. From what I've seen pet's are either used or not. As in
if the group has pets, the Shaman will summon one, if not, they won't. I
suppose this submission says it pretty accurately from what I've seen since
this original writing.</P>

<P><B>Ranger</B></P>

<P>Rangers are good as Tanks and Secondary Burners. They have good fighting
abilities and some good offensive magic.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Sent in via submission -</FONT></B> &quot;Rangers
make adequate primary tanks, but are best suited to the role of a <BR>
secondary tank/puller. With the formidable arsenal of pulling spells and
skills available (snare, tracking, archery) there are very few situations
where another class can surpass the usefulness of a ranger who knows how
to pull. As secondary tanks, rangers have a few spells that can quickly
get an enemy off a caster or a wounded primary tank for very little mana.
Rangers deal a very good amount of damage in combat, but are not as able
to take damage as the other melee classes. Ranger offensive magic is weak
at best. Rangers' magic is more suited to a utility role (invis for travel,
some stat buffs, very limited healing). Speaking as a ranger who has acted
as a group healer several times, leave the healing to the real healers.&quot;

<P><B>Rogue</B></P>

<P>Rogues get a raw deal right now. They are only suited for Secondary Tank.
They have a lot of abilities which are unused, which is really sad.</P>

<P>(Submission by high level Rogues would be appreciated to further understand
/ define their role)</P>

<P><B>Warrior</B></P>

<P>Warrior is really only suited for the role of Tank (and puller). They
have no magic, offensive or defensive. Warriors also tend to make good leaders,
as they have no magic to worry about / distract them, they are free to observe
the situation as a whole and call tactics.</P>

<H3><A NAME="section3"></A>Section 3: Group Selection and General Tactics</H3>

<P><B>Well Balanced</B></P>

<P>A well balanced group should have a couple of Tanks, a couple of Burners,
a Healer and a support class of some kind. Clerics and Bards are the best
choices for these last 2 roles as the Cleric's healing is second to none,
they have marvelous buffs for damage prevention, and the Bard can sing the
mana song, thus doubling the capabilities of all the casters.</P>

<P><B>Thumpin' Group</B></P>

<P>A thumping group is one that's Tank heavy. These groups can work but
will have bigger downtimes due to hit point recovery or disease problems.
This group can run into trouble with a higher number of opponents as Tanks
are built for a medium damage amount over a longer period of time, as opposed
to burners which are high damage, but long recovery after.</P>

<P><B>Blasting Group</B></P>

<P>A Blasting group is one heavy on casters. This group can be extremely
efficient in that it can decimate any low number of foes. However, their
weakness is a high recovery time, and if unexpected foes come in and the
numbers get uncontrollable, they will be distracted and go down quickly.
Distraction = death to a caster. This coupled with their soft skinned nature
makes it difficult to pull one from another with out sacrificing one for
the other.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>The key to an effectively run group is not so much in selection or balance,
but on being sure each knows his/her role within the group. Be clear who
is the leader / decision maker. Be sure you know who are your Healer(s).
Be sure to know who are your Burner(s). Be sure the Puller isn't pulling
too fast or too slow. Be sure to always call targets, and concentrate fire
if there is more than one target.</P>

<P>I find that as time goes on my experience with groups is generally getting
better. A good group you can trust and rely on to do their role right, is
an effective one. A good team will not die and always prosper. If your group
isn't working out voice your opinion. Let them know their flaws, give them
a chance to correct them. If they don't, I recommend you leave. A group
who has members who play out of their role puts everyone at risk.
