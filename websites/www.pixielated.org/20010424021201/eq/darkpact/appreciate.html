"3">I was out at Frys just now, waiting at the register. I look outside,
where there are some waist high podiums, to see a beautiful blond waiting
for someone. She's just kicking back there leaning against a podium, light
weight black work pants, low heel shoes, a light blue top that's sleeveless.
It's noon-ish, the day is beginning to warm up and be spring like. The breeze
is gently blowing her hair that's mostly tied up. She takes some hair and
brushes it out of her face, in that 'hair tossing' that women do that is
just so lovely.</P>

<P>I think to myself, there is a beautiful woman. As I see every time I
go out, but had I not seen the glint of a wedding ring, I would have gone
to mention how very beautiful she was standing there, her hair lit by the
sun. Upon reflection I probably would have anyways if I had any of my personal
cards on me (as sometimes a ring on that finger is not a wedding ring).</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>I'm sure a lot of you out there playing EQ, reading my page, have life
partners that are waiting for you as well.</P>

<P>I ask only that you remind them how beautiful, special and appreciated
they are. Take time out special to stop at the store on the way home from
work, pick them up some flowers. Call them now, just to say hello and ask
how their day is. Or if your already at home, take a minute to just look
at them, appreciate their beauty and love they give you, hug them, compliment
them, and remind them how much you love them. Take a day normally scheduled
for something else, and throw those plans away, spend the time doing something
together, a picnic, a movie, dinner out, exploring somewhere new, anything.</P>

<P><B>Guys</B>: I know your natural instincts are to crush and destroy,
why else would you have found my page?, but take a few minutes to appreciate
your partner, your kids. While your medding, or between combats even, walk
away, go up to them, hug them, tell them you love them and appreciate them
spending their life with you. It's not really so hard. Such a simple show
of affection can mean so much.</P>

<P><B>Women</B>: Guys are fairly incompetent when it comes to showing feeling
and emotion, be forgiving of this. Just because they don't say they love
and appreciate you doesn't mean they don't.</P>

<P><B>All</B>: Life is too short. Don't let the 'daily grind' get you down
and forget those that are important to you. Take the time to slow down and
appreciate what you have to offer each other. Remove the bills, the worry,
the traffic, the noise, all aspects of today and technology, what do you
have left? Only the love. Recognize and appreciate this while you have it.
