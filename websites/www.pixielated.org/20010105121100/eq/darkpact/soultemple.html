of Solusek Ro. From what I hear the other classes are no better.</P>

<P>Let me explain a bit: I don't like dungeons. I don't like camping. I
don't like how fiercely we have to compete for special items. When I heard
there was going to be a new zone full of quests specific to each class,
I was very excited and hopeful. I went on that first day, logged the quests,
went off line, printed the logs and chose one, which I as a Dark Elf, could
conceivably do.</P>

<P>During the next few days I gathered some clues, and traded for a few
Enchanted Platinum Bars as the quests all called for. I began my search.
Last Sunday I decided since I was sick and needed to study I would do the
quest, wait for whatever would spawn and read my college texts in the meantime.</P>

<P>I logged in at 7:30 am PST, which for me is very early. I waited at the
first spot for a bit. 10:00 rolls around and voila I get the first of 3
pieces required for this one quest I have decided to do. I move to the next
spot. I wait... I wait... I wait... at the end of 4 hours come 2 others.
They start to distract me with an intriguing game of deception. They are
standing in front of me (easily defeated by an F9 overview), casting spells
to block my view, and randomly dropping things to make it look like the
item was spawning. This was the high point of my day. These 2 competitors
provided more challenge and entertainment than this quest ever did. And
however, stressful, it was much more fun than actually completing the quest.
Needless to say their deception failed and I got the part. Had they not
been trying so hard to deceive, they may have gotten it. I move on to trade
the first part for the final part and get my &quot;great reward&quot;. At
3:30 I leave that spawn point and move on. I arrive in a very far away place,
get the final piece, gate back, and make my way to the Temple of Soulsek
Ro. I arrive at approximately 6 pm PST, nearly 12 complete hours after I
began. I hand the items over, hold my breath that the quest works, and indeed
am given my &quot;great reward&quot;.</P>

<P>But wait, whats this... No experience given? 12 hours spent, 400 plat
in value of traded stuff for the Enchanted Platinum Bars, and I get something
that is a meer 1 ac, 1 weight less, and +6 survive disease, better than
what I already had.</P>

<P>I make some shouts, and hear that the other pieces are no better. What
was to replace rubisite in class specific quests has wound up to be a meer
1 ac better than bronze and a lot of the + items are things we don't even
ever use.</P>

<P>I do more shouts and discover that a lot of the other classes face the
same dilemma.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>I was one of the first conceivable 20 to relieve my special fancy boots
on my server. I spent 12 hours of my time, 400 plat, gained zero experience,
for something a meer 1 ac higher and stat bonus I never use, than what I
already had.</P>

<P>Please people, research. Be very sure that the &quot;reward&quot; will
be worth the 12+ hours you spend on these new quests.</P>

<P>From what I've heard, you can buy or trade for better things that already
existed before the temple.
