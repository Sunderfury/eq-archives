"3">The night, it's starry sky, covered in a blanket of cool blue. As I,
looking upon my cold skin, am covered in a handsome midnight sheen. The
armor is strapped on, the shine of it nearly blinding my eyes in the twinkle
of the midnight starlight. A cool breeze blows through my hair before putting
on the face that I choose to show to the world. Ah better now, so much warmer
surrounded by the steel of the helm.</P>

<P>I hear the call of the dark tide...</P>

<P>Calling upon the dark father to follow my destiny I smite my foes before
me. They squeal and scream as they are stricken by the power of my spells
helpless before me. Their loot furthers my goals and needs.</P>

<P>I rest, feeling the grass beneath me, even through the steel. Meditating,
letting my hate wash over me, calming my mind.</P>

<P>I hear the call of the dark tide...</P>

<P>Traveling the land I find others, weak, helpless, engaging in battles
too big for their abilities. Fools. All the rage of the things I can not
accomplish alone fills me, from that I heal these people, or kill what they
can not.</P>

<P>Steal another soul for the father Innoruuk, in exchange for the freedom
of mine.</P>

<P>&quot;Hail and thanks&quot; they say.<BR>
&quot;Greetings&quot; I say. Fools. I have saved your life, it now belongs
to me.</P>

<P>Harvesting souls as I harvest loot, my travels continue, alone, as the
moon is alone in the night sky.</P>

<P>I hear the call of the dark tide...</P>

<P>The adventures increase, I grow more powerful. Others pass by me in the
night. I see them. Souls, harvested to serve my needs when the time comes.</P>

<P>The steel grows cold against my skin. The night grows late.</P>

<P>I hear the call of the dark tide...</P>

<P>I have traveled to the ends of Norrath and back, gained nearly all I
need to fulfill my destiny, as is the fathers will. To serve him, to serve
myself, let nothing stand in my way. I need no others, only the hate that
warms my cold skin from within.</P>

<P>I am alone, as I have been all my life. Free to serve my own will and
no others.</P>

<P>I hear the call of the dark tide...</P>

<P>Alone...</P>

<P>My skin cold as the night itself, my being empty, hollow...</P>

<P>My warmth... the rage and hatred that burns my soul at how easy the goods
lives are, how happy they play, how friendly the are, they find companionship,
love...</P>

<P>I am proud to be Dark Elf, needing no others, only myself...</P>

<P>I hear the call of the dark tide...</P>

<P>I feel it begin to well up within me...</P>

<P>And it is warm, as it runs down my cheek...
