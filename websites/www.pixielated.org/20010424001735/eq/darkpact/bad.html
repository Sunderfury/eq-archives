"3">&quot;Your a bad x&quot;, how often have you heard that? Probably not very often, but it does happen. For me, it's someone saying &quot;heal&quot; in group the second they get hit, proverbially wetting themselves and pointing the finger at it being my fault for their getting scratched, and now there about to burst like a balloon if I don't immediately heal them.</P>
		<p>But what really defines us as a 'bad person'?</p>
		<p>Does the fact that someone asked me to walk 5 zones away to rez them before seeing how far I was from them make me a bad cleric for saying no?</p>
		<p>Does the fact that I&nbsp;buffed someone to 3x the hp they had previously that day and then they charm something while were waiting for a raid and they not mention there being hit until they only have 1 bub left make me a bad person?</p>
		<p>No in both cases. It was the perception and lack to understand or see from outside there own viewpoints on the part of the accuser, that I&nbsp;then became a bad person.</p>
		<p>Through inflexibility of the viewer, you can be labeled as a bad person.</p>
		<p>This does not mean you are simply because they label you as such. It simply means that of all the people and all the accusers time, it simply means they would rather find someone else that fits their limited view and perspectives than find out the true essence of your being. That they are too lazy to see from a perspective not their own, something unfamiliar, misunderstood, or unknown.</p>
		<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>
		<P>If people don't take the time to learn what makes you unique, special, and talented in some way, that is their loss. Each of us has a unique perspective, and sometimes those perspectives work well for others, enhancing them to more than they were before.</P>
		<p>What makes us special, worthwhile, and good at what we do, takes time to be discovered by others. It's often hidden behind many layers of our own disguise / design, and filtered behind yet more layers of the person who is viewing us.</p>
		<p>Take time to find out more about someone before you point your finger at them and call them a bad person. There may be far more behind what you see than you will ever know.</p>
