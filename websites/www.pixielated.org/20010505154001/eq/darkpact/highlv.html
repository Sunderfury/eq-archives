"3">With my recent experience in Kithicor, that being forced to solo for
3 EQ day/night cycles, thus dying 4 times, in the process loosing 1.5 bub
from 35 th (about 8+ hours, which was about 1/2 my entire weeks play), I
question what it is that happens with age.</P>

<P>In a tell to a real life friend I express some anger at not finding a
group, having previously grouped with a 45 th I knew I got exp here, albeit
small. He asks 'what are 50s doing there anyways? They don't get any experience.'</P>

<P>Well, not all that were hunting in Kithicor were quite 50, and I'm sure
of those not all maxed on experience. Most were between 40-45 with about
as many in the 30-40 range as the 45-50 range.</P>

<P>But it raises interesting questions. Which I can only answer with theory
and conjecture, as I have no case studies of the life of a 50 th, nor do
I have the time to build them.</P>

<P><B>Theory 1- Harvesting</B><BR>
Having no experience to gain by killing, it is a plausible theory a lot
of the 50s will then harvest items they have yet to gain. For themselves,
and if easy enough, for others. I find that since I had a difficult time
finding a group, this must be a valid theory. 'Who's this Darkpact guy?
I don't know him. But I do have 2 friends who could use these items, and
there close by'.</P>

<P>Now, mind you I have no real problem if this is the case, as there is
a short enough timer on items now what you do have to be very close to grab
no drop items.</P>

<P>What I do have a problem with is preventing someone from grouping with
you, thus forcing them to solo, because of it. If someone had offered 'hey
you'd be great in our group, but we can't let you take any of the specials'
I would have said 'fair enough' as I already have one, and the one is all
I need for now. But I shouted about 3x for 3 days straight. No one made
any offer to group of any kind.</P>

<P><B>Theory 2- Plat</B><BR>
I have often found straight plat from 'easy kills' to be a high pull for
players of all levels.</P>

<P>From this most recent example in Kithicor, that being that 50 ths would
get very little exp from the same things I can nearly solo at 35 th (though
things do get up into the 40 s in there now), one must presume they are
harvesting plat as well for themselves and their comrades. Possibly to buy
things, though most is trade at higher levels, or to twink to lower level
characters, be them their own or not.</P>

<P>Another example is the Treants in South Karana. Why would anywhere be
fought over so heavily and have a list to fight it, if there were not an
easier way? I have heard people get the same or more exp fighting the avos,
for which there is not an average 8 hour waiting list. Why then would someone
be on a list for 8 hours to fight at one spot when they could get the same
exp elsewhere? Plat. It must be the plat.</P>

<P><B>Theory 3- The easy road</B><BR>
I think a lot don't go to the new plains because staying in Norrath is the
easy road out. I think they view killing to earn what they already know
exists, and can be quickly and easily sold, a bigger pull than that fancy
'Fear' or 'Hate' only item x, which happens to be no drop.</P>

<P>Here I really wish I were 50 th so I could see the interactivity between
the players in the other plains. I'm curious to see if the no drop items
cause cooperation (as I'd hope) or competition (as it is in Norrath for
non-no drop items).</P>

<P><B>Theory 4- Guardian angel, the road less traveled</B><BR>
The road least traveled from what I see, is that of one of aid of others.
To go to a low level area and help others. I know being a cleric I am the
ultimate guardian angel, however others can protect the young. Give them
pointers. Watch their backs, etc. It seems far too few are willing to 'spend
their time for nothing / on others'. What they don't often realize though
is that by doing so they gain far more in self respect, and instilling a
feeling of accomplishment in the young they are protecting, than simply
handing them something twinked.</P>

<P>One of my earliest memories in this life, was 'holding service' at 14
th in Lake Rathe. What I call 'holding service' is when a cleric heals /
buffs / etc. There was a necro there, he was fighting a Dry Bones skelly.
He was down to just under 1 bub health. The skelly would hit him, knock
off some health, I did my best heal I could, which put it back, the skelly
hit him taking it off, I put it back. This repeated about 7 times when the
necro finally won. Had I not been there he surely would have died, having
been to low to run to the zone. He repaid this service with bronze boots.
Something I myself, would not be able to get for another 10 levels.</P>

<P>Another time I remember well is a young dwarf in North Ro. He was nearly
dead, I healed and buffed him. He came back later, nearly dead, saying how
thankful he was for my help. He would get hurt, and I'd heal. He did this
about 3 or 4 times. Never asking or expecting my help, but as I was there
waiting, I'd give it. Once when he had returned from killing he said he
had killed 3x what he normally could have during that time because of my
buffs and healing, and that he didn't know how or when, but swore on his
life he would repay me someday. And I believe him.</P>

<P>Another time I revived a party of 10 ths in Paw who had respawned in
far away places like Hallas and the Feys. The leader, who had a 45 th character
as well swore to me he would pay me back with an item of my choosing for
aiding his low. I doubt I will ever see the item, but I believe he was genuine
and will remember it always.</P>

<P><B>Cause: Boredom</B><BR>
Simply, I think the higher you get the more bored the player is and thus
they instinctively turn to a life of collection, as over the levels they
have forgotten the enjoyment of helping others from their youth.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>To me, it seems, that I have met far more greed ridden, rude, harvesting,
high level players than I have met kind, friendly, negotiating, considerate
ones.</P>

<P>I had hoped as life progresses, that more would coordinate efforts by
saying 'ok we can hunt this now to get you this, then we'll hunt for that
for you, and the other for him'. But it seems more 'were camping x singular
item and will do whatever it takes to get it' (weather this means being
rude and pushing other competition out, or not letting others into the group
who may loot it and keep it, etc.)</P>

<P>I think Verant still needs to work on is placing special items TOGETHER.
So that groups have multiple objectives in single locations. For example,
group something a Shadow Knight could use with Shaman thing, thus influencing
the grouping of the evil races. Or something a Paladin could use with a
Druid. That way there is cooperation and player saying 'hey we got x this
time. You can use that one. Here ya go.'</P>

<P>There is a little bit of this cross dropping in Kithicor now, however
the competition is ridiculously fierce. I couldn't find a group at all,
and I'm just looking for experience. The amount of high levels there leads
me to believe they are there just for items for their friends. Which seems
really sad. Maybe it's just the way it is, but there should be plenty for
all, and I see no need for what seems to be common, greed, competition,
and hatred.
