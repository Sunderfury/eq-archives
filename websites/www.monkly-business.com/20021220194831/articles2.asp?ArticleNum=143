              <p>First travel to North Qeynos and go to Crow's Tavern, inside is an erudite named Umvera Dekash.

<p>Here is your conversation with him:

<p>You say, 'hail Umvera Dekash'

<p><i>Umvera Dekash says 'What, Southern ? Do I look like a merchant to you? Just because all these merchants are in my library, it doesn't mean that I am one. If you are interested in something other than spell scrolls, then, we can talk. </i>

<p>You say, 'I am interested in something other than spell scrolls'

<p><i>Umvera Dekash says 'Ah, so you do have half a wit about you! Very well. As you can clearly see, I am the librarian here. I keep track of all of the mystic tomes that enter this divine building. I also take care of all of the purchasing. Have you something to offer?</i> 

<p>You say, 'I have something to offer'

<p><i>Umvera Dekash says 'Excellent! You have no idea how difficult it is to get good help these days. Do you think you would have the time to gather some information for me? </i>

<p>You say, 'I have the time to gather information for you'

<p><i>Umvera Dekash says 'Even better! Well, it has been some time since the Tesch Val gnolls moved in on the Split Paw. That being said, we still know little to nothing of their origins. If you can bring me back the four scrolls that our diviners speak of, I believe I can reward you well. </i>

<p>Ok now you need to go to Split Paw in the South Karanas, Collect 4 different Tanned Split Paw Skin Scrolls. These are lore items, and look like a rolled up scroll. When you right click you can read the message written on them if you are fluent in gnoll. But even those unversed in gnoll can notice the number on the page. Collect scroll Volume 1, 2,3,and 4 and return them to Umvera in North Qeynos

<p><i>Umvera Dekash says 'Did I not ask for FOUR scrolls? What are you? Some kind of idiot?<br> 
Umvera Dekash says 'Did I not ask for FOUR scrolls? What are you? Some kind of idiot? <br>
Umvera Dekash says 'Did I not ask for FOUR scrolls? What are you? Some kind of idiot? <br>
Umvera Dekash says 'It's about time. Let's see here. Right.. right.. right. Very good. Right. There you are! I translated the text. Now the scrolls need to be bound. Take these scrolls to Jheron Felkis in Freeport. I believe he is staying in one of the spare rooms in Velith and Bardo's establishment. He will ensure they are bound correctly. Return to me when the binding is complete.</i> 

<p>You gain experience!!

<p>Jheron Felkis is located in East Freeport in Velith and Bardo's establishment, 3rd Floor. Hand him the note.

<p>You say, 'hail Jheron Felkis'

<p><i>Jheron Felkis says 'Ah, greetings, traveler! Settled into one of these rooms, have you? Well, this room is mine, so get out! Hey, wait! You aren't here to deliver a shipment of books to me, are you? </i>

<p>You say, 'What shipment of books?'

<p><i>Jheron Felkis says 'Oh, I typically receive monthly shipments of books from Umvera Dekash. I hear he has recently been promoted to senior librarian in Erudin. What a vaulted position! I could only aspire. I'm not going to be binding books forever, you know! 

<p>Jheron Felkis says "So you are from Umvera! What is this? Oh my! INtersting! I'll bind them right away! A little snip here..a little snip there.. All done! That didn't take long, did it? I won't be doing this forever, you know.
After the milita burned down my father's home, he could not afford to send me through proper schooling. Ah well, such is life!</i>

<p>You gain experience!!

<p>Ok at this point you are given a book called A Splitpaw Tome. You can open it up and read it, 8 pages of text, none of it seemed relevant to any type of monk quest so I wont bother posting the lore contained within, interesting history of the Torn Ear though. Now you get to run back to North Qeynos and deliver the book to Umvera.

<p><i>Umvera Dekash says 'You have returned safely. That is wonderful! Where the heck is my book, child? In my hands, I see. Such a bright little twinkle you are! Well, let me scribble something down on this pad here. There you are. Take this note to Durkis Battlemore in the Butcherblock Mountains. He is a remarkable smith, but more importantly, he owes me for his smithing books. 
</i>

<p>Durkis Battlemore can be found inside one of the guard buildings at loc 2072, 400 

<p>You say, 'hail Durkis Battlemore'

<p><i>Durkis Battlemore says 'What have ye got there, lad? Ack. I thought I would never hear from that crazy old man again. He wants me to give you a pair o' me gauntlets. I suppose I kin do that. Here you are, Southern. Wear them in good health. </i>

<p>You gain party experience!!

<p>Your reward for this quest is a set of Gem Inlaid Gauntlets. AC 8, dex 3, sta 3, weight 1.0, All/All. And yes I did get the Gauntlets identified:Item Lore: Gloves Crafted by Battlemore
