Guk</em> | Relentless&gt;</font></h1>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Overview</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Upper Guk is a great dungeon from
levels 15-35 or so. The loot isn't the greatest, although
Ghoulbane and the ancient croc are two highly prized spawns in
the zone. The main problems with this zone are the frequency of
trains (which is why it's best to hunt away from the main paths
of traffic) as well as the distance from a good bind location.
For evil races, this isn't too much of a problem, as grobb is a
very short walk away.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The spawn time in guk is about
16.5 minutes, and everything spawns according to this clock. All
spawns are standard everquest spawns, except the ancient croc,
which has a very odd spawning pattern which I'll discuss in a
seperate section. The key to hunting in upper guk is either
staying on the move so you don't get backspawned, or finding a
good safe spot to pull to and pull monsters to there. Hopefully a
safe room out of the way of trains. Pulling singles is very
useful, as is staggering spawns her, but with a 16 minute spawn
time, you can easily get experience without doing too much far
away pulling.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Probably the best groups for upper
guk are mostly tank groups that can just chew through the frogs.
A cleric helps, and a bard is really nice to have. Plus you need
some way to stop runners. Casters aren't nearly as important due
to the lack of dangerous casting frogs.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Monsters</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Frogloks in guk have a very
specific naming convention which can easily help you determine
levels/difficulty. There are basically three types of frogloks
besides the named ones: warriors, shamans, and knights.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Warriors are the standard
        froglok type, and are basically your standard warrior
        monster.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Shamans are shaman types of
        mobs. They go down quick, but they can cast spririt of
        the wolf and healing which is very annoying. They can
        also root. They are very fond of casting drowsy/walking
        sleep which slows down your attack rate. It's best to
        kill shamans before warriors. Typically 1 or 2 levels
        lower than their warrior counterparts.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Knights are just like
        warriors, except typically 2 or 3 levels higher, and they
        seem to have higher ac and strength than the standard
        warrior type of monsters.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Additionally, there are different
clans of frogloks, which range from level 14 to level 47. In
upper guk, they go up to level 31.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Wimps - Sentrys, guards,
        sentinels, neophytes and tads all range from 1-12. They
        drop netted and woven.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Tuk - These range from about
        12-16, and are the weakest kind. They drop woven armor
        and can be found mostly in the entry area of guk</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Gaz - These range from 16-20,
        and drop mesh armor. They are a little distance from the
        entry, and are relatively easy to pull to the zone.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Ton - These range from 19-24.
        They are found over most of upper guk, on the bottom
        floor.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Vis - These are the shaman
        counterparts to Ton. There are very few seen in guk.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Shin - These range from
        25-31, with the knights only being found near the
        entrance to lower guk live side. The knights are also
        found in lower guk. This clan is in charge of upper guk</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Nok - The shaman counterparts
        to the Shin warriors.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Tsu - Very rare to see one of
        these in upper guk, they are the shaman counterparts to
        the Wan knights in lower guk.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Given these level ranges, you can
easily pick an area of guk to hunt in depending on your levels.
Killing massive amounts of low blues is by far the best way to
get experience.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of the other mobs in guk are
Heart Spiders (poisonous, non aggro, social, around level 15),
Swampwater crocs (non aggro, around level 10), and Fungus men,
which i know very little about since there are so few of them.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Someone mailed me some information
on the Fungus Men (man, aren't they Fun Guys?): In the fungus
farm, there are:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Fungus Soldier - weak melee
        critter</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Fungus Breeder - druid type,
        casts stinging swarm, which is no joke if you're trying
        to solo it</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Fungus Ancient - I haven't
        gotten it to spawn yet, just heard them casting a few
        times. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Fungus Drones - will heal any
        fungus in range, so unless you can unload HARD its best
        to pull targets away from the room.</font></li>
</ul>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Map and Breakdown of Upper Guk</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">By far the best map of Upper Guk
is Quester of Norrath's. However, it is missing an area, which I
filled in with eq'lizer's map.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Heart Spider Bridge</strong>
        - Probably the least known spawn in Upper Guk is here.
        This area is known as the heart spider bridge, as it is
        covered with heart spiders. If you fall off the bridge,
        you have to swim around until you find the ladder leading
        back up to the bridge. Under the water here is a secret
        room that you can swim to. In this room spawns Tempus, a
        Dark Elf Necromancer, as well as the skeletel monk. No
        one knows what tempus is for, but he drops nothing and
        talks to no one. The skeletel monk is for some classes's
        armor quest.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The Ancient Croc Room</strong>
        - The most social area in upper guk. If the zone is
        completely empty, chances are you'll still find someone
        sitting in here killing the crocs. It's also a common
        bind point for casters that are hunting in lower guk.
        This room is completely safe and out of the way of
        trains. It is a very good place to med up. The room
        spawns either 1 saltwater croc, 3 saltwater crocs, 5
        saltwater crocs, or 1 ancient croc. The ancient croc
        drops 50/50 </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/gatorlegs.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">gatorscale leggings</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">/</font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/gatorskinsleeves.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">gatorscale arms</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">. He's a pretty rare spawn, showing
        up about 15-20% of the time. The saltwater crocs are
        about 29-31, and the ancient is 31 or 32. They hit hard
        for their level, but have very low AC. In order to
        trigger the respawn, all saltwaters must be killed.
        Saltwaters also drop the Rune of Scale for some wizard or
        necro quest.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Nokta Shaman Room - </strong>A
        new spawn in upper guk, the nokta shaman spawns in this
        room (There is also a Shinta Warrior and a Tonta Knight,
        but I don't know where they are). The Nokta spawns 80% of
        the time, and has the globe of fear for a necro quest
        about 25% of the time. The nokta shaman is exactly like a
        Nok shaman.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Froglok Summoner Room</strong>
        - This room spawns up to two froglok summoners near the
        benches on the sides of this room. About 5 frogs spawn
        total in here, so it's not an easy room. Froglok
        summoners are magicians, and they drop a Brazier of
        Elemental Summoning, which has one charge of the level 20
        (?) fire elemental spell. There is also a priest that
        sometimes spawns in this room that drops a enchanter only
        rod of some sort, probably for an enchanter quest.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Fungus Farm - </strong>This
        area is called the fungus farm, and is where all the
        fungi spawn. They drops some one use charge item, maybe a
        shield of thorns or something silly like that. They make
        funny sounds when you hit them, but they all have a built
        in damage shield which makes them annoying as hell to
        kill for melee classes.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Froglok Prison - </strong>This
        room is called the prison, as you can find some troll
        prisoners in the cells here. There is also a tower in the
        middle of the room. This room is where the Froglok Warden
        spawns. He's about level 25-27, and drops the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Elf-Hide.Gloves.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Elf Hide Gloves</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (common) and the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Troll-hide.Belt.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Troll Hide Belt</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). It's assumed that the elf
        hide gloves are made from dark elf hide, since frogloks
        are friendly to high elves and wood elves. Heh. The
        warden is a rare spawn.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Scryer Temple - </strong>This
        is considered the gateway to the second floor of lower
        guk. The room looks like a large temple with a little
        pool of water in the middle, and two columns of water.
        The scryer spawns on top of the stairs here in the
        rightmost spot. He drops the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bracerofwovengrass.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">bracelets of woven grass</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (common) and the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Shimmering.Orb.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">shimmering orb</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). He also drops a mask for
        an enchanter quest. In one of the water columns drops an
        icon for a cleric armor quest. Scryer is a rare spawn.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Shin Lord/Barracks - </strong>Probably
        the most dangerous area of upper guk, this room is
        basically a small cluster of many shin and ton knights.
        It also spawns the Froglok Shin Lord, who drops </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ghoulbane.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Ghoulbane</font></a><font size="2"
        face="Arial"> (rare) and </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Silver.Plated.Bracer.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Silver Plated Bracers</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (common). Beware in pulling the
        room next to the Shin Lord room. There's an invisible
        wall there that the Shin Lord can see and walk through,
        making a nice 6 or 7 mob fight if you're not careful. The
        shin lord is a rare spawn.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Large/Giant Heart
        Spider Room - </strong>This whole area is called the
        heart spider room, and is full of heart spiders. It's a
        very safe area to pull to. In the spot marked on the map
        spawns 3 heart spiders. The middle one can sometimes be a
        large or giant heart spider. The giant heart spider drops
        the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Chitin.Shell.Shield.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">chittin shield</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (common) and the </font><a
        href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/chitinshelltunic.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">chittin tunic</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). The giant spider is a rare
        spawn.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Safe Prison Room - </strong>Swimming
        under the water here and back up will lead you to a tiny
        room that seemingly has no purpose. This room is
        completely safe and is a good place to med/rest. If your
        swimming is good, you can pull to here too.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Froglok Necromancer -
        </strong>One of the low level mobs here, the froglok
        necromancer drops the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/pouchghoulashes.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">pouch of ghoul ashes</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">, which has some useless effect.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Froglok Idealist - </strong>Another
        low level spawn, the idealist drops a </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/vialeggwhites.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">vial of egg whites</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (common), and a </font><a

        size="2" face="Arial">moss mask</font></a><font size="2"
        face="Arial"> (rare). Both these items give enduring
        breath. The tonta knight also spawns here.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Froglok Realist - </strong>I
        guess this guy is supposed to be diametrically opposed to
        the idealist. His rare drop is the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/reedring.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Reed Ring</font></a><font size="2"
        face="Arial">, and I've gotten conflicting reports as to
        whether his common is the pouch of ghoul ashes or if the
        necromancer drops that.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Gaz Squire - </strong>One
        of the few low level mobs here worth hunting. He's about
        a 20% rare spawn, and drops the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/undeadcollar.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">collar of undead protection</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (common), and the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Runed.Bone.Fork.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">runed bone fork</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). He's about level 17.</font></li>
</ol>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Suggested Hunting</u></font></h3>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Levels 1-15. Probably stay
        near the entry zone and hunt pull the weenie frogs. Be
        careful on the C bridge, it can be hard ot navigate, and
        falling off can be a major pain.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Levels 15-20. Either hunt in
        the same area and pull gaz from near the idealist room.
        Or hunt near the heart spiders and pull from the scryer
        room.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Levels 20-25. Hunt near the
        froglok warden or near the dead zone to lower guk. The
        danger of hunting near lower guk zone is that people will
        occassionally train stuff to there while running to lower
        guk</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Levels 25-30. Now you can
        either hunt the barracks and do the shin lord with a good
        group, or move to near the saltwater/ancient croc and do
        tons and shin warriors. The ancient croc room is nice
        because there is a zone right by there which is very safe
        since there's never anything on the other side.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Levels 30-35. The only place
        left to hunt are the shins and nok by the live side of
        lower guk. Ancient room is good for this, as well as
        right by the live zone. At 34-35 the dungeon starts
        greening out, and in a large group you'll probably have
        trouble finding blues to hunt. Time to move to lower guk.</font></li>
</ul>
