            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              I think we've all seen it or heard about it, or might have been involved in it at one time. It's called the 'bait and switch' scam.  You pick up your local newspaper and read about a good deal on VCR or stereo or (insert nice new toy that you want here) and you waltz down to the store to pick one up.  When you get there, you find that they are all out of that item already because for some reason they didn't think that they would get so much response to the sale.  So while you mumble to yourself and wish that the salesman played on a PvP server, he points out that there is another DVD player or wall mounted card table or (insert another nice new toy that was similar to the one you wanted but isn't) for sale.  Now either you can buy the patio furniture or ceiling fan or (insert the item that A_Salesperson_18 is talking about); or you can leave the store empty handed.</p><p>So while you head home, you think about what went wrong.  Was it your fault?  Possibly.  If you had gotten to the store earlier then maybe they would have had that phone book or set of steak knives or (insert same thing that you wanted from the first set of choices).  But since you slept in or had car trouble or just didn't ever about that sale until it was almost over, you missed out. </p><p>But you knew it was a good deal. You knew that as soon as you heard about what was being sold down at Ma -n- Paw's Shirts -n- Service station that you would be getting your monies worth.  You knew that all the hours spent working down at Fred -n- Ed's Fuel -n- Fud scraping stuff off of stuff that had stuff on that that needed that stuff to be scraped off of it was worth those hours. Even when you called up your friend's lawyer's cousin's dog's mother, she could tell it was a good deal.  When the SETI program found aliens living in your unclean sock drawer, the orange fuzzy thingies agreed that it would be a good trade in their barter system.
So from what you can gather, the store should have been able to know that the clock that had 13 hours instead of the old hat 12 hours was going to sell like hotcakes.</p><p>It was bad planning on the store's end. </p><p>So, now that you are familiar with the old 'bait and switch', let me try to apply that to a company that we do business with for a few hours ever week.  Verant.</p><p>For those of us who have had the game since release or close to it, the loot system was pretty static.  There were no sweeping changes that moved everything around the world.  At least not for a while.  Rubicite armor became the thing to get, so it was changed so that it would not drop anymore.  Players were promised quests and a majority of the classes were given class specific armor quests (some classes did not get these quests, but that's another story for another day).  Some other items were also changed to not to drop anymore (manastone for one, Akabars box [spelling??]).</p><p>The players were a bit peeved when this went on.  A few even had the nerve to ask Verant do to some actual testing and see how any new items that were going to be put into the game would work so we could avoid this mess again.  A company do testing?  Well, testing was to be done and all would be happy again.</p><p>All was going well for a short while. Then Verant announced the release of RoK. An entire new continent and an increase in the max level limit for all classes.  Many people were also happy to hear about a new playable race, the Iksars (a class with KS in their name to me is funny, as they can also play a necro).  Verant put an 'online store' where people could pre-order RoK and have it delivered so they would be able to play as soon as it went live on the servers.  Some people even had the nerve to ask Verant to put RoK on the TEST SERVER FIRST.  But Verant decided that it didn't need testing and that it would be a grand addition for all. </p><p>Oh, the reason they say they didn't put RoK on the Test Server first was because they thought everyone would just make a char on the test server and overload it.  While some folks might do just that, Verant should have even foreseen this complication and LOCKED OUT new chars on the test server for one month before the launch of RoK to avoid this from happening.   They could have even put a level limit to play (if you are not over level 10, then you can't log in on your character on the Test Server) until the testing was finished.  This would have stopped most people who just had a level one char on test from contributing to overloading that server.</p><p>I think the majority of us know what happened.  A lot of people didn't get their orders on time, that is if you were lucky enough to even be able to order the expansion thru the 'online store'.  Those that did get their CD were able to pop on over to the new continent.  We know what they found.  Lots of new baddies to kill and some nice loot.  Real nice loot. The kind of loot that makes you want to loot it. </p><p>Then when Verant noticed that something was wrong with the loot that was being dropped, they decided to change the looting tables around (AKA what drops from what baddie) very shortly after RoK went live.</p><p>Let me say that again incase you were watching a .mov in another window on your computer while you were glancing at this.  Verant decided to change the loot tables because they noticed that baddies were dropping stuff that they were not supposed to.
-blink blink-</p><p>Now to me, something is wrong with this picture.  I could go into some of the programming aspects of this and say that an_ugly_baddie_03 has an object that it point to.  This object would be a loot table. There would be set object tables that an_ugly_baddie_03 can have a random chance of dropping.  This ensures that Mr. ugly thingie does or doesn't drop stuff that they should not be able to.  A moss snake should never drop a FBSS since a_moss_snake_17's object pointer goes to a table that would only have scales, copper, silver, snake eggs, and maybe 1 or two other things on it.  Since the FBSS isn't on that table, no speedy snake.</p><p>Back to the release of RoK.</p><p>Let's give Verant the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe they checked the loot tables and didn't notice that things were not right.  Maybe they hired a temp person to do this job and they decided to play some quake III instead of see what a_drolvarg_XX had a chance of dropping.    In any case, it was not what it was supposed to be.</p><p>So RoK goes live and folks get very nice items, or rather those that were lucky enough to get the CD.</p><p>Then about a week or less later, Verant changes the loot tables.</p><p>I can see their reasons why they should have changed the loot tables.  The stuff that was dropping was VERY nice.  It made me wonder what the stuff off of the baddies in VP would drop if a gem encrusted ring was a semi common drop off of just about any baddie in the dreadlands.  But the risk vs. reward wasn't what it should have been and a change was made.</p><p>Once again, people asked Verant to do some testing before things go live... blah blah blah...</p><p>Sometime after this, on the test server, a patch is applied there.  The folks on the test server are foaming at the mouth.  Dragon loot is dropping off of just about everything.  PP is falling from the sky.  Wood elves are running around nekked .....  err  never mind about that last one.     So now the test servers' economy is farked all to hell and Verant decides to do a player wipe.  The players on test are not happy of course, so they are put back in the test server, nekked of course.</p><p>I can actually see Verant doing this more often (the player equipment wipe, not the dragon loot dropping). It is a TEST SERVER. </p><p>Anyway, a few weeks after this, a patch goes live on a Friday or Saturday (I forget which day) and about 3 hours later all servers are down for a few hours while they fix stuff.  What happened ?  It seems that the patch that hit the test server somehow made it live. </p><p>Now we are up to the present time frame.  An uber guild broke into VP.  They killed a lot of the baddies there.  They accomplished what many casual players will only dream of.  And the loot to be had was the grandest of it all.  err  never mind.... </p><p>Uberplayer has looted a snake scale.</p><p>I have nothing wrong with a player getting what they earned.  They broke into what Verant deemed as a VERY hard zone.  There would be no GM support in there (we all know that it would have no bugs at all) and players would enter at their own risk.  From where I sit, they should have gotten stuff that made my Master Wu's Trace stick look like a cracked staff.</p><p>Wait, I heard they did get a Master Wu's Trance stick ... ?? (well, maybe not.. but you get my idea)</p><p>So, what does Verant decided to do?  Well, their current plans are to move the loot that once dropped off of common baddies as a common / uncommon drop that they moved to harder baddies as a rare (or even just a random very rare drop off a baddie) now to VP.</p><p>- blink blink -</p><p>I won't go into the risk vs. reward for VP.  You've heard about that already.  The drops from VP need to be changed, but not they way that Verant is thinking of doing.</p><p>Anyway...</p><p>Have you heard that there is a new release coming out soon ? </p><p>Oh yeah.  And I'm sure it will be tested properly too.</p><p>Consider this a plea from all the casual gamers out there.  If you are going to do the bait and switch with loot, have the balls to say so.</p><p>If it was honestly a mistake,  then FIRE YOUR CURRENT QUALITY ASSURANCE PERSON THAT DOES THESE TESTS and get a new one, as they have been playing Quake III instead of actually checking stuff.
