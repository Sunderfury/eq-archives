        <I>The sprite looks to be pretty common and seems to travel from the
        druid ring to the southeast and back again. He is also a very low lvl
        imp. If Eejag is already spawned he won't shout to the zone when you say
        the challenge to the sprite. To initiate the sequence, hail the Fire
        Sprite with 'I challenge Eejag''</I></FONT><BR>

      if one person goes down and gets the target then everyone assists the
      person, and finds him via the /yell command. Everyone can charge in,
      including Clerics (in case they want to do group heals), as the lava does
      not interrupt spells. </FONT></P>

      many scales as possible for the Monks of the guild (Gabor, Zebdiane, Bodi,
      Masikisto and Gebb) and then move onto Cadfiels part of the Cleric Epic

      have made the Primary group as tough as possible for the simple fact that
      I want all damage dealt their way, and I want them to get the kill, purely
      so that the Monk looting the scale can get it immediatly without waiting
      for the corpse timer to be freed, and the need to float around looking for
      the corpse.</FONT> </P>
