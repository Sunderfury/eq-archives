<p>Robe of the Lost Circle Quest

<p>There are two Monks, of a new order called the Whistling Fist, and they have a quest which results in the Robe of the Lost Circle. The quest requires you to have completed the Headband/Sash Quests from both Qeynos and Freeport. The first of the Monks, Brother Qwinn, is in South Karana.

<p><b>Brother Qwinn</b><ul>

<p><i>Hail Brother Qwinn.

<p>Brother Qwinn says 'In the name of the [Brotherhood of the Lost Circle] I greet you. 

<p>What is the Brotherhood of the Lost Circle?

<p>Brother Qwinn says 'The [Monks of the Whistling Fist] are called the Lost Circle by others. We are an ancient league of monks. Long forgotten and few remaining. Within this realm there are only two. I and [Brother Zephyl]. We seek the items stolen from us. I seek the [Code of Zan Fi]. 

<p>What is the Code of Zan Fi?

<p>Brother Qwinn says 'The tome called the Code of the Whistling Fist has been stolen from me. It contains many secrets pertaining to our brotherhood. Thankfully it is magically locked and only a Zan Fi master could unlock it. I quest for a monk to retrieve it. Would you be an [interested monk].

<p>I am an interested monk!
 
<p>Brother Qwinn says 'Then venture into the depths beyond the great Solusek Mining Company. There, living among the Kobolds, will be Targin the Rock.Get the book from him and return here and wait for my reappearance. When we meet again you shall hand me the book and a Purple Headband earned from the Silent Fist Clan. Do so and you shall be closer to joining the brotherhood.</i>  

<p><b>Brother Qwinn's Path</b> 

<p>Brother Qwinn is not a permanent spawn, and is a rare wandering NPC.

<p>A tracker in the form of a Druid or Ranger is extremely useful in tracking him down, and most Monks at this stage offer rewards for him to be held for them.

<p>Brother Qwinn does have a Placeholder, but who/what not been confirmed. However Sentry Alchin is confirmed NOT to be a PH, as both have been seen on tracking at the same time. 

<p>The only thing that can be confirmed about his path is the fact that he wanders past Paw and towards the aviak village, with the rest of his route being random. I would walk in a northerly direction from the Lake Rathe zone, passing with both the aviaks and paw on my right hand side towards the ruins near the bridge, killing everything on that path in an effort to get him to spawn.

<p>Again, he is a very rare NPC, and I personally waited 6 days, spending 4 hrs a day looking for him, so take this into account if multiquesting the Robe.

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> As of 23.1.01 A patch has increased Brother Qwinns spawn rate tenfold.</ul>

<p><b>Targin the Rock</b><ul>

<p>The code is dropped by Targin the Rock, who is approximatley a 39th level Monk, in the Sol B King Room. Again, for a guide, use Jekhar's Sol B guide.

<p>The Map is Questor's, and the zone marked is the zoneline to Lavastorm, with the Number '5' representing the King Room.

<p>He is an uncommon spawn rather than rare, and isprobably only slightly rarer than the Kobold King.

<p>The room has 4 spawns, which can be any of the following: Greater Kobold, Solusk Kobold, Greater Kobold Shaman (and pet), Solusk Kobold Shaman (and pet), Solusk Kobold King, or Targin. 

<p>The King spawns to the right of the Throne, and Targin on the left, so they do not share the same spawn point. He greets you with:

<p>Targin the Rock says 'You have much to learn.' and 'Your actions and history are a personal affront to all I stand for.' 

<p>He hits for around 80 damage. 

<p>Although he is supposed to be tougher than Raster, this room within Sol B is MUCH more likely to be camped than the Mino Room in Lower Guk, and so there will be lots of ppl on hand to help, either from the King Room, or from a group taking the Preist or Champion rooms. 

<p>For reference, at 42nd, with full hits and a mend, and armed with one Baton and no haste, I could solo some Greater Kobolds, and even a SK with a sizable hp buff, but breaking the room with Shaman and others in there on my own would be VERY hard. Splitting the room may be a possibility, but you will more than likely pull the other nearby rooms as well, so it is best to join a group nearby, or make it known to the zone that you are after him. As a personal Note, I spent around 35 hours over a month long period camping Targin. I arrived at Sol B half way through 42nd, and got him at 45th. </ul>

<p>Returning the Code of Zan Fi, plus the Purple Headband to Brother Qwinn, will result in you getting the Needle of the Void, and the following conversation.

<p><i>Brother Qwinn says 'We had an agreement. The proof of a skilled monk, the purple Headband, and the Code of the Whistling Fist. 

<p>Brother Qwinn says 'We thank you for the return of the Code of the Whistling Fist. Take this sewing needle. You shall find it useful should you aid [Brother Zephyl] in his quest. His item, the needle, a swatch of shadow silk and a scroll containing Jonathan's Whistling Warsong. Into a sewing kit they will be going. And into the brotherhood will you. I hope you do not wish me to [return the headband].. </i>

<p>If you wish him to return the headband, but you will LOSE the item you give him, he says:

<p><i>Brother Qwinn says 'Then you will return that which was earned or the robe.</i>

  

<p><b>Brother Zephyl</b><ul>

<p>The other Monk, Brother Zephyl, is in the Rathe Mountains. He, like Brother Qwinn also has placeholders and is not a static spawn, but a rare NPC. His placeholders are confirmed as Hasten Bootstruter (for the Journeymans Boots quest), a drake, and a mid 30's Ranger called Maldyn the Unkempt. If you are unlucky to find Hasten up, and do not have the manpower to kill him, he apparently despawns in 2 to 4 hrs. Maldyn was easily bested by a 45th Monk with Haste, but he has a damage sheild up, so fight with fists rather than low delay weapons, else you will do his job for him. The PH is a 20ish minute spawn.

<p><i>Hail Brother Zephyl! 

<p>Brother Zephyl says: Greetings. I am one with the [lost circle]. You have found me. What is it you desire? 

<p>What lost circle? 

<p>Brother Zephyl says: The [monks of the whistling fist] are called the lost circle by others. We are an ancient league of monks. Long forgotten and few remaining. Within this realm there are only two. I and [Brother Qwinn]. We seek the items stolen from us. I seek the [Idol of Zan Fi]. 

<p>What is the Idol of Zan Fi?

<p>Brother Zephyl says: The idol of Zan Fi is a sacred totem to our brotherhood. I cannot share it's secrets, but I can offer to you a reward for its return. Are you an [interested monk]?

<p>I am an Interested monk! 
 
<p>Brother Zephyl says: Then venture to the lands of evil. The swamps of Trolls and Ogres, there will seek a monk called Raster. He has the idol. You will return here and wait for my reappearance. When we meet again you shall hand me the idol and a Red Sash earned from the Ashen Order. Do so and you shall be closer to joining the brotherhood.  </i>

<p><b>Brother Zephyls' Path </b>

<p>The PH's I believe path differently, but they all travel down the narrow chasm heading west from the Feerot zoneline. I would wait at the crossroads (marked 'A') and ambush the drake PH, or found that around the area marked 'B', where there were a few small depressions, Hasten would run back and forwards a few times before running off again. 

<p>Both Hasten and Zephyl also get stuck at around the tip of the blue arrow marked above, 'C', which has a rough loc of 752, 161.

<p>The Drake PH would follow the blue path, head over Hill Giant Plateau, head towards the spinx, then I assume past the lizard camps and back to the crossroads. Hasten always was too quick for me, but I believe he follows a larger path. 

<p>Brother Zephyl wants the Idol of Zan Fi, which is in the possession of Raster of Guk, who is a VERY rare spawn, near the Mino Elders room in Lower Guk. </ul>

<p><b>Raster of Guk</b><ul>

<p>It is high recommended to read a guide on Lower Guk (I used Jekhars) to familiarize yourself with the area, and the following are recommendations for items that you have with you. The camp is extremely long, and you cannot always rely on help. 

<p>Damage Shield Potions: Raster is tougher than the Mino's, and if you are able to handle a single Mino, but end the fight with little health, then this may possible turn the tide. Also, it will be just your luck to have this ultra rare spawn pop when you are low on health.

<p>Minotaur Horn: Found on the Mino's here, and on Mino's in the Gorge and Steamfont, this can be given to Raster to stop him duel wielding. Two horns will not work.

<p>Bandages: A large stack of bandages (at least 100+) and a high Bind wound skill. The higher the skill, the less bandages will be required. Also auctioning for stacks of bandages at high prices helps when you are low.

<p>Level Ranges: With Fists and no FBSS, it is recommended that you be approx 47th to break the Mino room (within the respawn time) and be able to handle Raster. With Fists and a FBSS, probably 46th, Weapons with no FBSS, 46th, and if equipt with Weapons and a FBSS, probably 45th. These levels are approximate, and when taking Raster, include the above precautions. By weapons, I think that a Wu's or Cane of the Tranquil are needed, and if armed with a Baton or two, it is probably best to wait till the next level. These level ranges do not include the Mino Elder, who is tougher (due to its ability to heal.)

<p><b>Greater Minotaurs</b>

<p>The Minotaurs range approximately range from levels 35 to 39. They are warrior type mobs, have approx 1500 hp each, and hit for a maximum of 74. The Mino's are tougher than Drolvarg Snarlers from Firiona Vie in Kunark, so imagine breaking a room full of very hard Snarlers, and you will be on the right track. Rasters room is marked with a Red Star.

<p>The area contain's 6 Mino's, including the Raster PH near the pot, and the Elder PH in the pit. Two of the 6 are wanderers, one near the Raster PH, and one near the stairs, and the last two mino's are static.

<p>Sometimes the Mino's can be vis knights instead, who are rougly the same toughness as Mino's, although they tend to run quicker.

<p>There is a additional wanderer here, who can be anything from a Froglok slave to a Yun Ghoul Wizard.  

<p>The (frog) wanderer comes by every 3 minutes, so it is best to time the path before fighting. Pulling the Mino's can be done by aggro radius, and does not require throwing anything or running up and attacking them. 

<p>Note: Sometimes the wanderer is not around. I thought that he may have been killed, but at one 6 hr camp, and at one point with only 9 ppl in LGuk, I did not see him at all. Which means it is possible that he paths in a different way.

<p><b>Method</b>

<p>Pull to the pit trap, stopping just before you fall down, (obviously). This gives you a fairly long time of whacking on their back when they run. If you fight them closer to the original room, they have enough time to run down the hall where a few (frog) shaman usually are, who will heal the fleeing Mino, or to some other Mino's in a side passage.

<p>It is recommended to pull the mino's in the following order:

<p>The wanderer nearest to the pulling point,<br>
The nearest static (once the other wanderer has moved towards the Raster PH spot),<br>
The other wanderer, <br>
Then the far static.

<p>The PH itself is best left to despawn at 8am, so that you can be sure of the exact time for respawns and despawns of the PH. 
  

<p>While waiting for the despawn, you can either pull the Elder PH, or leave him in the pit, and rest. Once the PH despawns and respawns, continue clearing the room as and when the Mino's pop. I never bothered with the Elder PH, leaving him in the pit. This helped me be at better health when the other mino's popped.

<p>The (Frog) wanderer is usually not a problem, and if you rest down the tunnel towards the trap, you will be able to see him coming and have enough time to FD before he aggros on you. It helps to time your pulls right after he leaves, so the mino's wont get unexpected help. Also 2 passes from the wanderer equals one mend.

<p>Once the room is broken, you can stay near the pot (where Rasters PH is), and the (frog) wanderer does not come near enough to worry about, so you can clear the room from there. I found the corridor is safer however, as resting by the pot sometimes gave mino's a free hit as they spawn on top of you. 

<p><b>Raster</b>

<p>The bane of most Monks existence, Raster is approximately a 37th level Monk, and is extremely rare. Lots of Brothers have had 200+ hour camps, and it is an average 40 hour camp. He has approximately 1700hp, punches for 80, and can kick in the low 100's. However he dosent hit very often, and I only took 400 damage or so before he ran.

<p>Rasters PH is a 72 min spawn/despawn, but the rest of Lower Guk is on a 28 minute spawn, so the best way to maximize the amount of PH you get is as follows. (Times are obviously EQ times.)

<p>5am - Spawn. Leave this one to despawn, unless it is Raster obviously. <br>
8am - Despawn.<br>
10am - Respawn. Kill this PH<br>
7 to 8pm - Spawn. Also kill this PH

<p>This method ensures 3 PH's per EQ day. 

<p>When arriving at the camp, just check the above times to see whether it is best to kill the PH, or let it despawn. 

<p>I ALWAYS let the PH despawn when I arrived to camp, unless it was just after 10am, where I would kill that, and let the next one despawn. This is important, as if you start to kill the PH straight away, the times will not match, and you could have big problems. One time, I could not clear the path to the PH quick enough, and so the PH was up for a while while I rested. I killed it, then the next spawn, the 5am, was very late, arriving sometime after 7am. This then despawned 30 seconds later! Thankfully it was a mino, but if it was Raster....

<p>The mino always despawns at the 8am even if it has been recently aggro'd. For instance I went to pull a mino, who then pathed near the PH, dragging that along with it. Feigning, both mino's returned to there spots/paths. The PH then despawned, as it was 8am. Whether this works if the PH is off his spot, I cannot confirm. 

<p>It has been noted that the PH is 85% likely to be a Mino, 10% to be a Froglok, and 5% to be Raster, but I am sure some veteran 200+ hour campers will say more like 0.5%..... 

<p><b>Minotaur Elder</b>

<p>The Minotaur Elder is approx a 35th to 37th level Mino, but is fairly tough in that he will get off about 4 heals and 3 nukes before he is out of mana. If you find it tough to keep the Mino room cleared you can just leave the Mino (who is the Elder's PH) in the pit. He wont aggro unless you stand close to the edge of the pit (which is a good way to pull the one down there if you have difficulty with ladders like most people). It may be wise to experiment with how close to the pit you can get before the PH comes, as you will be fighting near here when pulling the Mino room. Do not worry too much about accidently pulling this PH, as I never did in my entire time there.

<p>The Elder drops the Chrysoberyl Talisman, an AC5, +3 Wis, +20 Mana, Wt 1.0 necklace, which is Lore, and sells well, and the Elder's Rare Drop is the Carved Ivory Mask, which is AC2, +4 Agi, +10hp, Wt 0.9lbs and is hardly worth anything.</ul>

<p>Returning the Idol and the Red Sash to Brother Zephyl, will earn you the Rare Robe Pattern, and the following conversation:

<p><i>Brother Zephyl says 'We had an agreement. The proof of a skilled monk, the red sash, and the idol of Zan Fi. 

<p>Brother Zephyl says 'We thank you for the return of the idol of Zan Fi. Take this rare robe pattern. You shall find it useful should you aid [Brother Qwinn] in his quest. His item, the rare robe pattern, a swatch of shadow silk and a scroll containing Jonathan's Whistling Warsong. Into a sewing kit they will be going. And into the brotherhood will you. I hope you do not wish me to [return the sash].</i> 

<p>If you wish him to return the sash, but you will LOSE the item you give him, he says:

<p><i>Brother Zephyl says 'Very well. Give to me that which you have been rewarded or the robe, if you have a tailored one. </i>

  

<p>Shadow Silk is tailored using the following components: a Shadow Wolf Pelt (not a ruined pelt from a Shadow Wolf), a Silk Swatch (easily made from two spider silks) and a Scroll of Gather Shadows. The silk is supposed to be hard to make, and a skill of 50 in Tailoring will only give you a 50% chance of making the swatch, but I made a swatch first time with a Tailoring skill of 26.

<p>The Gather Shadows Scroll is found in a Necro guild, and Johnathons Whistling Warsong from a Bard Guild.

<p>You should now have 4 items, the Needle of the Void, the Rare Robe Pattern, the Shadow Silk, and a Scroll of Jonathans Whistling Warsong.

<p>Place all the four items in a Large Sewing kit, and hit combine. This will result in the creation of the Robe of the Lost Circle. You do not require a tailoring skill for the Robe, assuming someone makes you the Shadow Wolf Pelt, as the Tailoring skill chance to fashion the robe was removed.
