In preparation for LoY, the Froglok population of Norrath has invaded Grobb, driving the trolls out of Grobb into the wilderness searching for a new home - Neriak is where i believe they will end up. supposedly there were a few GM events around doing this but heh i was not on last nite due to having to get ally to my wife faction- my son's faction in the middle of the night is KoS though - little guy woke at 3am.

<i>
** Interface **
</p>
<p>
- All settings for the Songs window should now be saved properly when the player logs out.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug that could cause the Bit Depth and Refresh Rate setting to not save properly upon exit.
</p>
<p>
- Users of Windows XP should no longer be seeing their Windows mouse cursor or other windows 'bleed through' into the game.
</p>
<p>
** Gameplay **
</p>
<p>
- Changing from an old model character to a Luclin model character at character select should no longer result in the character having no hair.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug that caused merchants to charge a little extra or less (1 copper).
</p>
<p>
- Merchants will no longer claim that they will pay 1 copper for starting equipment (they have never actually purchased such items).
</p>
<p>
** Spells **
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a problem with the Giantsbane Spell quest NPCs not spawning in Skyshrine.
</p>
<p>
- Failing to hide while invisible will now make the invisibility icon disappear.
</p>
<p>
** Trade Skills **
</p>
<p>
- Many Planar Recipes can now be used in collapsible containers. Some Planar Tailoring can only be done in the Tanaan Loom as opposed to the Planar Sewing Kit.  Nothing that was previously made in the Loom was added to the collapsible tailoring kit.  Skills changed were Baking, Sewing, Jewel Craft, and Fletching.
</p>
<p>
- Added gnome cultural recipe book to Ak'Anon.
</p>
<p>
- Changed the weights on Spiritstones to be more in line with Faithstones.
</p>
<p>
- Changed Collapsible Jeweler's Kit to 6 slots from 4.
</p>
<p>
** Zones **
</p>
<p>
- Grummus is much more likely to stay in his home.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed the door to the Ak'Anon zoo, by request of the Zookeeper's Union #23.
</p>
<p>
- Newly created Wood Elf Druids will now make their first appearance in the world much closer to their guild master.
</p>
<p>
- Fennin Ro is now more durable, more in line with the other elemental plane gods.
</p>
<p>
-Rallos Zek now moves considerably faster then before, as do his cohorts. He will also become very, VERY angry should he be removed from his lair(s).  
</p>
<p>
- Skyshrine will once again require a key for exit into the Cobalt Scar.  The fact that the key was not needed was a bug.  We do understand that few people actually walk through this area considering the other methods of transport available, but the dragons aren't leaving their doors open.
</p>
<p>
** Items **
</p>
<p>
- Corrected the inventory icon for the Acrylia Studded Legs and the Two-Handed Practice Sword.
</ul>
</i>
</p>
<p>
Over all an interesting little patch. I KNEW the skyshrine zone to cobalt scar key requirement was a bug-since the requirement vanished on the revamp of skyshrine. One little bit of worry i have, just like the patch jan 28 or 29th i am getting reports of different .xml file downloads, i got the bigbank, others got inventory, even others got the char select. Those .xml files are not supposed to be "live" until the 24th. so this is a bit of a warning, if you crash alot, its probably SoE's fault.

With the patch on February 4th we fixed a bug with Affliction foci, but we failed to mention it in the patch message. We corrected a bug that was allowing these foci to work for too many spell types, including things like snares and slow. Affliction foci now only work on damage over time spells. 
</p>
<p>
We apologize for not mentioning this fix in the patch message. 
</p>
<p>
The very high savings in cast time and mana, as well as the extended duration, were planned to only work on damage over time spells. These spells needed more help than all other detrimental spells. The affliction foci for haste and mana are dramatically better (more than twice as effective) than other items of the type. The extension focus is better than any other as well, though not to such a degree. These items are only so much better than others because they were intended only to improve the effect of damage over time spells to bolster their value. 
</p>
<p>
We fixed a similar bug in June of 2002. Some time between then and now the bug resurfaced. The bug was fixed while another was being addressed, and because it wasn't the targeted bug fix it didn't make it into the patch message. We certainly wouldn't have left this information out on purpose. 
</p>
<p>
We understand that this change has an effect on some players. But these foci have always been intended to work exclusively on DoT spells, and we do not plan to undo the bug fix. We'll look at other detrimental spells and see if there are some lines that should benefit from similar focus items, but that will be done on a case-by-case basis and not by reverting this recent bug fix.

Got This From Henora:
</p>
<p>
The shamans over at the Crucible have discovered the
Affliction focus items have stopped working on
debuffs.  There's some extended history on this issue.
The effect came into game, on Affliction Efficiency
(mana save), Affliction Haste (spell haste) and
Affliction Extension (spell duration) at the same time
as all the other focus items.
</p>
<p>
At that time they worked on all DoTs and Debuffs. 
They were soon changed to work only on DoTs.  Then
unannounced, they were changed back to all DoTs and
Debuffs and have been that way for months and months
now.  Today they were changed back to only DoTs
without a patch message.  I suspect this is VI working
to nerf charm but I don't really know.  
</p>
<p>
This is actually a very dramatic nerf to shaman. 
Particularly in regard to Affliction Haste.  
Turgurs cast time increases from 1.7 seconds, back to
3.0 and Malo cast time from something like 3.4 seconds
back to 6.  Also Affliction Efficiency,
Malo/Slow/Root/Cripple now all uneffected by
Afflicition focus, now all cost 33% more mana.
</p>
<p>
Many people have designed their gear around focus
items, have spent guild loot points and cash for items
with these effects.  Many guilds, including my own
have based loot awards around focus effects and their
value to the classes these items are given to.

A decent amount of people have been having problems with EQ crashing to desktop
after selecting their character, and not being able to log in with THAT character. The most common Solution - well besides trusting someone to log in your character to move 1 zone over- is to go into your Everquest directory and to delete the following files. ss.opt and all *.opt files that have to do with that character's name. interestingly enough if you have memory leak/framerate problem, doing this also seems to fix framerate problems as well. It did for me.

Two for the price of one. Lets hope we don't need patches to fix the patches. On a side note, anyone else having problems with memory leaks with only 1 of their characters? i play Lenardo and have to camp and restart the game every few hrs to fix framerate issues, but if i play my cleric i can play for 6hrs and have it be smooth as glass the entire time.
