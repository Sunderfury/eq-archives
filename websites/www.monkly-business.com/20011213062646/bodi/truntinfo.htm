        marked 'C' in the section of the map below. As shown in the map, the
        shorter path requires levitation to cross broken bridges, but the
        quickest route is simply to swim up the waterfall to the right as you
        zone into the mines. To swim up, you require a shrink and SOW.</FONT><BR>

      that Gwan (who enrages, has bad pathing problems and is in Sky) and also
      Eejag (where the lack of visibility and x/y fighting hamper things), so
      based on the level of your troops, Trunt can be defeated by a single group
      of people -- This group normally consists of a 60th Warrior, and 55+
      Cleric, and other high levelled tanks, all the way upto three groups of
      50's (which, like with Gwan, is more than enough).</FONT> </P>

        during the day allowed me to take some close up pics of the Sleeping
        Ogre, who really does have a huge aggro radius. I stepped into the
        'room' area, more or less opposite the lava crevice, and the Ogre came
        running, so it is worth repeating the fact that make sure your troops
        are well back. Feigning made him return to his sitting position.<BR>

         <BR>
         Handing in the Breath of Gwan was easy. There is no need for
        invisibility or any other method really, just run and feign behind him.
        If you are really paranoid about the hand in, you could quit out, but it
        was not necessary. I ran, feigned, hit sneak, stood up behind him, and
        then handed in the breath.</FONT></TD>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Once the breath is handed in,
      Trunt immediately spawns, and attacked me. I ran back to the group, and
      took in the region of 800 damage, and got hit by the 200dd Fist of Earth
      proc (which doesn't knock you back.) I was fully buffed however, and had
      nearly double my hitpoints, hovering just over 3k in total.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Running back to the rest of
      the helpers, I find them all lined up, which was an excellent sight --
      reminiscent of Zulu (hold em, HOLD EM!) and sadly I was a bit busy and
      didn't take a screenshot. Once in range, Bugrup cast a spell, Trunt found
      a new person to attack, and the fight started.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Again no deaths, and I would
      imagine that group one could have taken him, but overkill tactics are the
      best in my eyes.....</FONT></P>
