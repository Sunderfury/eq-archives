    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Back in the Runnyeye area for the start of
      26th, and continue to swell the supplies of BI to the rest of the Unsung
      Heroes. Myself, Doyle and another Warrior called Nash attack and defeat
      Borxx, the Evil Eye that dwells in RE, and then decide a raid on the other
      Evil Eyes deeper within. This did not go well, and both Doyle and Nast
      both fell to the eye's attacks. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">I begun to practice more on the Feign
      Split technique, and succesfully split and pulled the King room to the
      Warlord room, providing steady victims for myself and Doyle. Moved on
      again, this time travelling back to High Hold, fighting in the basement
      against the Pickclaw Goblins that lived there. Although the hunting was
      good, the need to be in a group, and on a 'list' was got annoying very
      quickly. I am still unsure now why there is a need for a list, but still.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Back to RE, and I pick up a BI crown and
      mask among other things, and sell them on at the bazaar. I am blessed with
      some Drakescale leggings from my old guildmaster Shou, and finish the
      Militia Tunic quest while I am still in Freeport.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Back at KFC I go, and get myself killed
      when the world seemed to freeze, which was not a pleasant experience, and
      I practiced my 1HB on assorted birds. Trotted off again, this time to
      colder climates towards Permafrost, just for a look. The Archioligist
      pack, and Dented Brass mask both good Monk items of my experience, drop in
      the icy dungeon, but the pack was my main goal, as it could magically
      reduce the weight of objects contained within. Luckily a Wizard and a
      Cleric took me under there wing, took me to the spot where the Goblin
      Archeoligist  spawned, and when he arrived, they grasiously let me have
      the bag. More travelling took me back to KFC, and there, and at the Paw
      spires, I fought with Doyle till I leveled.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT>27th
      meant a new skill, that of Disarm, and I practiced it on a decaying
      skeleton until I was very good at it. Managed to pick up a Froglok Crown
      at the bazaar, to replace the bundle of sticks on my head that was the
      executioers hood, and am now broke again. Hearing of a quest that
      originates in Kerra Isle, I spent some time in Akanon fighting Clockwork
      Spiders, before being teleported to complete the quest. I now had the
      Kerran Toy, a handy magical object to keep where my shuriken reside, and
      that gift me with a small armour bonus. Went back to KFC and the spires,
      with a few runs to RE, and this level was complete.</FONT></P>

        <TD HEIGHT="185" WIDTH="452" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">A
        new continent had been discovered as I hit 28th, and both myself and
        Doyle, packed our overnight bags, and got on the boat to the Butcher
        Block mountains. Once there, we took a rather impressive looking boat to
        the continent of Kunark, stopping at the town of Feriona Vie.</FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Our first hunting ground was the Lake of
        Ill Omen, and here we found a race of lizards known as the Iksar, a new
        breed of Goblins, and also a small dragon like race known as the
        Sarnaks.</FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The Sarnaks inhabited a castle keep, which
        I pulled recruits away from to fight. Doyle and I hunted for a while
        within the Goblin tunnels, with I running deeper in, while he waited in
        ambush. I alternated between the Goblins tunnels, the Sarnak keep, and
        also near the lakes shore, hunting Iksar, Sabertooth Grimalkins and War
        Bone Skeletons. A new Monk armour, Crescent, had been found, within a
        Crypt known as Dalnir, found in the Warslik Woods, and populated by
        Sarnak cousins, called Kly.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The 29th Circle still finds me in the
      Lake, fighting all that I had hunted before. My fighting prowess began to
      improve, as I started to hit four times in one round, or 'Quads'. I stayed
      completly in this area, and my eagerness for hitting the 30th Circle made
      me complete this level very quickly.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">30th Sees the start of my first 'Hell
      level', and my skills raise deceptively slow, especially grouped. More
      fighting in the Lake and at the tunnel entrance, until my curiosity got
      the better of me, and I went to find the Crypt of Dalnir.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">All of the monsters that inhabit the top
      level of this dungeon are within my hunting range, but many are casters.
      Unfortunatly for me, the Kly are the ones that drop the Monk armour, and
      are on the two lower floors. This does not stop me however, as I get
      invisibility cast upon myself, and drop down the pits to the lower levels,
      hiding under a bench in a room known as 'The Kly'. He, apparently, is the
      leader of the Kly forces, and dropped the Necklace of Superiority, a very
      nice piece of jewelry indeed. No armour dropped, but a Wizard Lady blessed
      me with a nice 2HB weapon for me to practice with. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">I am killed by a Goo, who suddenly became
      more powerful, but later get the armour I seek with more invisible trips.
      Skulking Brutes outside the entrance to Dalnir keep me amused for hours,
      and another trip inside Dalnir costs me my life, this time at the hands of
      a Coerced Gnome. By the time I had reached 31st, I had the Slippers,
      gloves and leggings of Crecent, and had been killed by another Gnome. I
      was also kicking for 54 damage as well, which is nice.</FONT></P>

        <TD WIDTH="536" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">For the 31st
        circle, I hunted more Skulking Brutes outside Dalnir, until I found a
        giant camp to hunt at. This camp has 3 Giants, all pullable by most
        classes, with a quick spawn turn around. Myself and Doyle fought here
        for a while, then I returned to Dalnir to show Twigaletto the 'Lumpy
        Goo', a monster who drops a Fighting Baton, a very good 1HB weapon, high
        on any Monks christmas list.<BR>
         <BR>
         Unfortunatly, I got myself killed, trying to disarm a Goblin, who
        called his friends in as reinforcements. I managed to get killed by
        about 10 assorted monsters very quickly, all baying for my blood.<BR>
         <BR>
         More Skulking Brutes, or 'Monkies' fall, and the ones at the entrance
        to Dalnir are very good to solo, as you could run from the 2 room to the
        3 room, then run back and find the 2 room populated again. </FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">More fighting here or at the Giant camp,
        along with numerous Bank runs (a Monk's life to carry only 2 or 3 pounds
        of loot) see's me hit 32nd.</FONT><BR>
