Posted on the Official Forums
</p>
<p>
<ul>
We officially started Beta 3 today! 
</p>
<p>
Here are important notes:
</p>
<p>
We will be inviting 5000 new people by Friday (go easy on those F5 keys)
</p>
<p>
The NDA is still in place. We'll let you know when it has been lifted.
</p>
<p>
We will be adding more people next week and the week after. We would like to ramp up to 50,000 by early May.
</p>
<p>
The process is mostly random, but we will still hand pick people who we think would make good testers from these forums.
</p>
<p>
We do not have an official release date yet, but will inform you as soon as we do. (We would like to get little bit into Beta 3 first so we can be confident of any date we give you).
</ul>

BARF.. 
</p>
<p>
Seriously though, this game looks fun but unfortunately I get motion sickness and FPS type games tend to make me ill. Spiritual, Baelish & I walked in on the tail end of the planetside demo (we were on break from eqlive forum 1- and wanted to hit the eq2 forum) where 2 of the dev's were playing and the third was answering questions. The forum went over by ~20 minutes.
</p>
<p>
I was impressed with the clean graphics, the fast game play, the smooth animations of the pc's it was all very impressive and it looked like it is going to be a lot of fun to play, especially if you are into Co-operative team play fps games.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately due to motion sickness susceptibility I doubt that I will be trying the game beyond any beta testing I might do. They are about to go into open beta and put the stress test on, but they are looking for each  server to have 3-5 thousand people playing at a time.

This is the First of many news articles in the next few days about things i learned at the Fan Faire.
</p>
<p>
According to the dev's -Paul answered this one - at the eqlive forum, the Plane of Time IS finished and was ready when pop was released. 
</p>
<p>
However, the Rathe encounter in poeb is being reviewed by the eqlive team at this time. Apparently the encounter is a bit too tough. For those that do not know, as i understand it(i've not been there so i don't know exactly the details beyond this: there are 12 spawn, all 12 have to be dead at the same time ie before respawn. respawn is 6 minutes.
