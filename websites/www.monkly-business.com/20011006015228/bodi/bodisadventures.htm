      <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">My first experience of being a Monk was
      spent in the area outside of my starting city, Freeport, fighting the
      large infestation of rats, snakes and bats, with the occasional beetle
      thrown in, all the while improving my fighting skills. Soon, I found that
      certain quests where given by the masters, in recognition of deeds done.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">My first quest, was to hand in my
          guild note and receive my tunic, and I also found out about the
          prospect of earning Sashes of Order if I was up to the task, starting
          with the White.</FONT></P>
        
        <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT></P>
        
        <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Once I had hit the second circle, I
          ventured into the East commonlands, just to adventure, but followed
          other peoples advice about not going too deep into the tree line for
          fear of the monsters that lived deeper in. Death followed me in the
          shape of a black bear, and rather shockingly, my Guildmaster, who took
          offence in my questioning of him. I continued to hunt in the
          commonlands with my friend Doyle, who together killed (and in turn
          where killed by) more assorted wildlife.</FONT></P><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The
        fourth circle took me to adventure some more, and so I followed a path
        that ran through the east commonlands, which ended in a forest called
        Neklatos. A wolf attacked me when I was not ready for it, but a guard
        was nearby, and so I ran to him. Unfortunatly this guard was a Dark Elf,
        who did not take kindly to me 'ruining his lands' as he put it, and
        killed me while the wolf watched. I decided not to come here again.</FONT><BR>
        </TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">For the fifth circle, I travelled to the
      desert of Northern Ro, and accompanied people to hunt the desert
      tarantula's there, mainly because I needed to complete my Yellow Sash
      quest. I ran into my first Madman here as well, who promptly killed me.
      The madmen plauged me somewhat while I hunted here, as I would always find
      them leaping on me, while guards and other people would watch me fall to
      the floor rather than help.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The sixth circle was tough. I alternated
      between hunting in the East Commons or in Befallen with Doyle, with both
      of us taking it in turns to stagger out of Befallen, laden with booty,
      returning with 8gp, varitable riches for us at that time. I say tough, as
      the monster population of the Commons took it in turns to kill me, first a
      ghoul, then a griffin, then a kodie, then the ghoul, then the griffin
      again......suffice to say that I was killed multiple times by anyone and
      anything.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">More Befallen trips through seventh and
      eigth, along with practicing on my tailoring skills on the passing large
      cat population, and I also hunted in the Commons and the desert of
      Northern Ro.</FONT></P>

        <TD HEIGHT="290" WIDTH="572"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">For the
        remainder of 9th through to 11, I decided to venture to Guk, mainly
        because I had ran out of money buying Woven armour from others. I stayed
        in the top 3 or so rooms, right next to the zone because of the NASTY
        trains, and obtained nearly 20 pieces of Woven and netted armour, which
        where light weight versions of cloth and patchwork respectively, from
        the Frogloks that inhabited Guk. I was replacing armour I wore for
        better armour, as well as making a lot (for my level I thought) of
        platinum, by selling the excess pieces.</FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">After that profitable first trip, I
        returned no less than 3 times, sometimes selling the woven that I was
        wearing (at inflated prices,) and replacing it when I got there. I had
        now earned myself enough money through my dealings to buy lots of Mesh
        (a light weight version of leather) and even an Undead Collar. The rest
        was spent buying Doyle some banded armour. I did also make the LONG trip
        to Qeynos here, to see how my Brethren of the Silent fist train, and to
        see if I was worthy for their Headband Quests.</FONT></TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">By the end of 11th, I was finely atired
      with 5 pieces of Mesh, with the balance being woven, and through a loan
      from my guild (The House of Light,) a pair of Golden Carnelian Wedding
      rings, which made me more agile.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">For the 12th Circle, I resided at the
      Halfling home of Misty Thicket, and I cannot recommend this enough, it is
      probably the best pre-teen hunting area, and I should have come here
      earlier (if I did not have so much fun in Guk!) Fighting Wasps and Young
      kodies amongst other things, and also on the look out for the rare (in my
      eyes) Legionnaire spawn in the orc camp, that I needed for my Orange Sash.
      When one came along, he was brought down (with the help of other Brothers
      in the area - a group of three Monks is an awesome sight!) By this point,
      I had added the Orange Sash and a Lockjaw vest to my equipment. I
      mistakenly killed a named goblin who lived in the area who the Halfling
      Deputies liked, so they took vengance upon me. I also had the pleasure of
      meeting a Werewolf in the West Commons, and he had the pleasure of ripping
      my face off.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">At 13th, I decided to travel some more,
      and had heard of a place called Lavastorm, were the Fiery beasts drop gems
      as loot! Getting invisibility cast upon myself (a SOW helps as well) I ran
      through the Dark Elven lands, and arrived in Lavastorm to fight Fire
      Elementals and Fire Drakes. I was in a good group, (with 2 Clerics) and
      soon, I had nearly reached 14th. A lot of the loot was stackable, so good
      for us weight watching Monks. Selling items and returning, I managed to
      pick up a Leering Mask here, AC3 +3 Dex, from someone in Najena. I
      Returned here for the most of 14th as well, and spent the remainder in
      Wcommons. </FONT></P>

        <TD HEIGHT="206" WIDTH="552" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">15th:
        After training in the skill Double Attack, I went to the Oasis to fight
        the multitude of Crocs and Caimans there, but soon tired of the rotting
        crocidile meat in my pack, and travelled to Faydwer with Doyle instead.
        Fought for a while in Crushbone against the Orcs, and also went to
        Unrest. The house of Unrest is very scary, and even the Gazebo was
        overrun with undead and beetles. More death followed here, and I was
        particulally upset to be killed by amongst other things, my undead
        brethren, who I thought might leave me alone, but didnt.<BR>
         <BR>
         16th: Still in Unrest at this point, my cash slowly rising, and I was
        on the lookout for a cheap Bracer of Battle. Had some good group fights,
        a memorable one being a group of 6 of us fighting 6 Ghouls. The party
        had one each, but the fight started to go bad, and two of the group
        zoned, two died, and myself and another where left fighting the remaing
        3 ghouls. </FONT><BR>
        </TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">My one went down, but I was rooted, and
      had to watch as the other 2 ghouls tore into the last remaing member. My
      root broke, and I, full of shame at leaving a member behind, limped to
      safety.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">I returned to Crush and did some quests
      there, (Keys and Shoulder pads) and myself and Doyle managed to find and
      kill a Warlord, which unfortunatly did not carry the prize we both sought.
      Doyle later defeated the Warlord and gave me the Bracer he had found, and
      then used our combined cash for one of his own at a later date.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">17th: Feign Death. Feign Death. It needs
      to be said twice as this is a VERY good skill for us Monks. Unfortunately
      it did not help me (as I had not trained in it yet,) as running back to
      the boat I died in the arms of a Dwarven guard, killed by bandits. This
      level (excluding my death here obviously) was good for me, as I picked up
      not only a Bracer of Ellerossi (a magical item that granted AC5 +5 Str)
      from a Brother (very cheaply) who was leaving these lands, but also a
      Orange Headband from him as well (thankyou BrotherOashi!) To regain my
      level I returned to Oasis, then spent 20 days training in Feign Death.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">At this time a new armour was found,
      called Raw Silk. This armour was lightweight, and made from Spider silk,
      the equivalent of Woven. Shortly after, Cured Silk was discovered, with
      the toughness of Mesh, lighter, and fashioned to look like the clothes of
      our Masters. I spent an excessive time hunting spiders for silk, and also
      hunted wisps, Kodies and the Piranha, all in the area known as the West
      Commons. Feign Death worked a few times for me (even after just getting
      it), once when I heard a Griffen behind me, I feigned, and another when I
      was losing against a Kodie, I feigned and then a SG ran over my head
      ignoring me. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Now, with nearly a full set of Cured Silk
      armour, fashioned by my Tailor Pionier, more experiments led to the
      discovery of Wu's fighting Gauntlets, AC4 Wt 0.1, which shone like a
      Greater lightstone, again made by Pionier. My good fortune is not over as
      I am given a component for the Purple Headband by a Paladin named
      Rathendar. </FONT></P>
