Guk </em>|Relentless&gt;</font></h1>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Overview</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lower Guk is one of the two
primary dungeons for high level characters (35-50). While there
are other hunting areas open now, lower guk continues to be one
of the most crowded dungeons at primetime. One of the major
reasons for this is that the loot here is very good, with many of
the &quot;best of&quot; class items available here. Lower Guk can
give very good experience, especially at the off hours, but
during primetime, finding good uncamped hunting areas can become
very difficult.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lower Guk is accessible from Upper
Guk in 4 areas, however, 3 of the 4 entrances lead to near the
same spot, called the &quot;dead side entrance&quot;. The
entrance from upper guk that is further away from the rest leads
to the &quot;live side entrance&quot;. Guk is typically divided
into two sections, live side and dead side. The live side
contains live frogloks, while the dead side contains froglok
ghouls. These two factions are supposedly warring, although they
won't attack each other or anything like that.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The live side is less camped than
the dead side, because many people don't want to hurt their
froglok faction. Live side also has alot more wanderers, so it
can be considered more dangerous, and I'm sure many many people
get lost in the maze on the live side.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The monsters here range from the
Shin Knights at minimum level 27, to the Froglok King and Guk
knights, who reach level 49.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Monsters</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Much like Upper Guk, frogloks come
in different varieties. In Lower Guk, there are no warriors..
only knights, shaman and wizards. The live side has knights and
shaman, the dead side has knights and wizards. The dead side
creatures can also ghoulroot like any other ghoul.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Shamans are shaman types of
        mobs. They are much more annoying in Lower Guk than in
        Upper Guk, mostly due to the pets that they have, as well
        as some of the nastier DoTs (Scourge, Venom of the
        Snake). They are usually the first targets, followed by
        knights, and then the pets.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Wizards are much more
        annoying than shamans. They are only on the dead side.
        They nuke hard and have few hitpoints. Always kill the
        wizards first.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Knights are basically
        standard warrior type mobs.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Lower Guk, there are a
completely different set of clans from Upper Guk.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Shin - These range from 27 to
        31 or so.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Vis - These range from 31 to
        34.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Wan - These range from 34 to
        37. These are the bread and butter mobs of this dungeon.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Zol - These range from 37 to
        40.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Dar - These range from 40 to
        42. Even at level 50, most classes can't solo them
        without a pet.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Bok - From 43 to 45. Very
        dangerous.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Guk - The most dangerous clan
        in guk, they range from 45 to 47 I believe. Wizards and
        Shaman at this level are also &quot;Guk&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Tsu - Shaman/Wizard
        Counterparts to the Shin.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Tal - Shaman/Wizard
        Counterparts to the Vis.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Urd - Shaman/Wizard
        Counterparts to the Wan.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Yun - Shaman/Wizard
        Counterparts to the Zol.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Kor - Shaman/Wizard
        Counterparts to the Dar. Very dangerous.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Jin - Shaman/Wizard
        Counterparts to the Bok. Not fun.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are also many other monsters
in Lower Guk. The most common is the Greater Minotaur, which you
can find on the live side of lower guk. These guys are very
similar to Wan Knights in ability and level. On the dead side,
you will find Gargoyles, Black Widows, Vampire Bats, and Greater
Ice Bone Skeletons, all of which range from 30-35. Rarely a
Basilisk will randomly spawn somewhere in Lower Guk. They are
extremely weak and easy to kill.</font></p>

Guk are Quester of Norrath's. Not only are the extremely

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lots of spots to detail here:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Live Side Entrance
        Area - </strong>This area from the zone to this point is
        the entrance area of the live side. Lots of people set up
        in this area and pull to here. This is a pretty nice
        place to set up, except that you're in the path of any
        live side trains. It's probably best to pull from the
        maze to here for awhile until the way is clear and you
        can set up camp elsewhere. This area is mostly Shin
        Knights, and an occassional Tsu shaman. There is a little
        know secret wall right before the bridge on the left side
        that leads to the upper area. Nothing of interest here
        though. Falling off the bridge on the left side is a nice
        shortcut to the Shin Knight Water Room (13). Past the (1)
        marker is the live side maze, which occupies the majority
        of the live side. Be careful here, it's easy to get lost
        in this maze, and it's alot deadlier than that Cazic
        Thule maze. The easiest way to get through the maze is to
        hug the right wall all the way to the jail room (4) and
        then cut straight through. This will take you to the evil
        eye room (5), from where it is easy to get to any of the
        other major named spawns.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Three Minotaur Room </strong>-
        3 Minotaurs spawn in this room. If you are camping the
        patriarch, this is a good place to do it from, otherwise
        you might lose the patriarch to passer-bys. There's also
        a special froglok spawn named Slaythe the Slayer, who
        dropped some broken bow quest item or something. He
        spawns near here, but I don't have any other information
        on him.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Patriarch Spawn - </strong>This
        is where the minotaur patriarch spawns. He's around level
        35, and a ranger mob, which makes him a real pushover.
        Common drop is the A</font><a

        size="2" face="Arial">zure Sleeves</font></a><font

        size="2" face="Arial"> (good ranger only sword). I've
        found that the common/rare ratio is closer to 60/40
        rather than the standard 80/20 of most monsters.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Jail Room - </strong>One
        of the few rooms in the maze which is easy to distinguish
        from others, this room has 3 jail cells in it. It also
        spawns 3 Wan/Urd monsters. It's mostly used as a
        landmark.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Evil Eye - </strong>The
        evil eye is a level 35 wizard mob that can see invis. He
        spawns about 80% of the time, and drops the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/evileyebag.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Bag of Sewn Evil Eye</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (common), and used to drop the </font><a
        href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/manastone.html"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Manastone</font></a><font size="2"
        face="Arial"> (rare). Conflicting reports say that the
        manastone still drops, but like 1-2% of the time. Dunno
        for sure. This room is useful as a camping spot (not at
        the eye itself, but at the shore between the jail room
        and the eye. It's also easy to get to the different areas
        of live side from here. Facing out from the evil eye
        cubby hole, left will lead you to the live side keep (6),
        right will lead to to the jail room (4) or the noble room
        (7), and straight will take you to the elder room (12) or
        dead side.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Live Keep - </strong>Sometimes
        called the castle, or the live tower. It's a common
        misconception that the Froglok king is here. He's not.
        The keep spawns the Yun Priest and the Crusader. The keep
        has 3 levels. The roof and entry bridge are usually Vis
        and Wans, the second floor is Zols and Yuns, and the
        bottom floor is Zols and Dars, and rarely a Bok. You need
        a good 38ish group to do the priest properly, and a good
        42ish group to do the crusader. If your group is good,
        you can set up camp in the Priest room and pull the
        crusader. The priest spawns in a room on the second
        floor, and the crusader spawns in the middle spot at the
        end of the third floor. Both are uncommon spawns. Priest
        is a 39ish cleric, and drops </font><a

        can lay hands.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Noble Room - </strong>This
        room is where the froglok noble spawns (37ish enchanter).
        It's also the entrance to the super hard area of the live
        side. There is a gateway here. If you go through it, it
        will lead you towards the king. This room is another
        easily identifiable landmark. The noble drops the </font><a

        an awesome item if monks could use it. Hehe.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Huge Elemental Room -
        </strong>The huge elemental is a really annoying super
        aggro see-invis mob. And while his name says he's huge,
        he's actually smaller than a standard elemental. Weird.
        Even though my froglok faction was dubious, he attacked
        me, and the zols in the room assisted him. He's about
        level 40, and he looks like a water elemental. He drops
        nothing. I believe he's mostly here as a deterrant to
        explorers. He also hits quite hard.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>King Prep Room - </strong>This
        room usually has a few Boks and Kors, as well as a high
        level Granite Gargoyle, and is a great place to pull the
        king to if you're trying to break the spawn. There is
        also a wanderer that goes from here to the king room, and
        Dars aren't uncommon.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Herbalist Room - </strong>This
        is where the Froglok Herbalist spawns, along with one
        other Dar level mob. He is a shaman mob. Drops </font><a

        size="2" face="Arial">Mithril Two Handed Sword</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). He's got a ton of hit
        points, plus a lay hands. You can usually tell when he
        has the sword since he wields it. Behind him is a zone to
        upper guk, which takes you to the innothule entrance of
        upper guk. It makes a very good escape from bad pulls or
        a king fight gone horribly wrong. It's faster than
        evacing, since the tanks don't have to run from South Ro.
        Occassionally, one of the guards spawns the Froglok
        Tactician, a high level wizard. Drops </font><a

        room spawns the Minotaur Elder. Be careful, as there is a
        pit-trap leading into the pit in this room which can kill
        you if you aren't careful. The elder himself spawns
        inside the pit, and is a pretty common spawn. He drops

        to set up camp. From this room, you can get to the dead
        side of lower guk pretty easily, and I've actually pulled
        dead frogs and other stuff from the dead side when
        camping here. A small tower leads from live side to dead

        safe area. If you fall down the trap, you can fight
        _just_ the elder spawn with nothing else joining. He may
        suicide when trying to flee though.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Shin Knight Room - </strong>This
        area of lower guk is one of the few areas that I've
        consistently found uncamped. It has about 8 or so Shin
        Knights that spawn here, and it's a pretty good place to
        pull the maze to. There's also a corridor between the two
        rooms which no patrollers go through. A small group can
        make use of this corridor as a safe pulling zone.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Bedroom - </strong>Aka
        &quot;BR&quot;, this is one of the biggest landmarks in
        the zone. It's mostly considered the entryway into dead
        side lower guk, and alot of time there will be a group in
        that room, killing the frogs, spiders, bats, and
        gargoyles that are easily pullable. Many expeditions to
        lower guk begin at the bedroom, where the group will get
        together, buff and invis up, and then head to their
        destination. It's a pretty good experience area, but I
        mostly ask if it's camped so that I know I can head over
        there and meet my party. It's also a good place to get
        invis to undead. This camp is also the most common to
        break and run to zone. People get complacent here, and
        get hit by the respawn, or pull too many of the greater
        ice bone skeletons, which causes alot of trouble and they
        run to zone. If you are in a bedroom group, suggest they
        move to the spider room and pull from there. This room is
        also in the path of EVERY dead side train. Beware.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Spider Room - </strong>Another
        common location to camp for bedroom hunters. It's out of
        train paths, and you can pull bats, spiders and gargoyles
        with ease. Only thing to watch out for is another group
        in the bedroom stealing your spawns. Good xp.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Greater Ice Bone
        Skeleton Room - </strong>Also called GIBs or Gibs or GIB
        Room. 4 Greater Ice Bone Skeletons spawn here, and they
        end up killing alot of the lamer parties that try to pull
        them. Very annoying monsters. Around 32-33ish.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Ritualist Spawn</strong>
        - This entire area is known as the bridge. Crossing the
        bridge leads to the tower, and falling off the bridge to
        the left is a quick way to the bottom floor of lower guk
        dead side. The marked spawn is the ritualist. Normally 3
        tal wizards spawn here. Sometimes a ritualist spawns
        instead, who is a necromancer, around 32. Drops </font><a

        after spawns in Lower Guk :). If you turn right at the
        bridge, you can go down to live side of lower guk.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Gargoyle Spawns - </strong>Three
        gargoyles spawn here. They drop some good loot, including
        something for bard quest armor. Usually pulled by elder
        room, SR camp, or BR camp.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Store Room - </strong>aka

        kinda messed up the number ordering here. This is where

        archmagi is a rare spawn, and is guarded by 2 dars. He's

        </strong>There are 3 spots in this room, each of which
        can rarely be a frenzied ghoul. Frenzied ghouls hit very
        hard, especially when they have a flowing black sil sash.
        Alternately, these spots can be bloodthirsty ghouls, or

        same group as the sash. Note that the area marked on the
        map is a triple spawn, but the sentinel is not one of
        them. The sentinel spawns alone in the secret passage
        room to the west of this marked spot.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Slave Room - </strong>The
        only uncamped room in lower guk. This room has a zol and
        a dar in it, and the rest of the mobs are level 5 froglok
        slaves. Whee, fun to kill. (On a side note, I forgot to
        mark a spot on the map. Just above the &quot;C&quot; on
        the bottom floor map, there is a sharp L turn. This spot
        is one of the few areas that no wanderers come to. It's a
        safe area, and some people even bind here. After dropping
        off the bridge at C, most people regroup here.</font></li>

        froglok executioner spawns on the platform in the middle
        of this room (which is easy to recognize because of the
        cages in the room trapping froglok slaves). He's a 37ish

        spawns somewhere around here, and drops the Parchment of
        Flayed Skin (common) and some Quill (rare). I believe
        both of these are quest items.</font></li>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Suggested Hunting</u></font></h3>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">30-35 - Probably the only
        places to hunt are near the zones on dead and live side,
        killing mostly shins, and maybe an occassional vis/wan.
        The Shin Knight room is also good at this range.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">35-40 - For XP, the maze, and
        the bedroom are good areas to hunt. Braver souls can do
        the Store Room, Elder Room, and even the top of the keep.
        Towards the top of this range you can start doing the
        tower. Zols should be the top monsters you should try to
        kill.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">40-45 - Time to move out of
        the bedroom and storeroom and move to the tower or the
        keep. Savant, Sage, Exe, Cav should be a good doable
        combo, or at the Yun Priest and Crusader. If you get into
        a good group, you can do the Frenzied, Sentinel, Hand,
        and Archmage.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">45-50 - The tower and keep
        should be pretty easy, as well as most of the bottom
        floor of guk. You should be killing dars regularly. The
        Ghoul Lord and Froglok king should be your main targets.</font></li>
