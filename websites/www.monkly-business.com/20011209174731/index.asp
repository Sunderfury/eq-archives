From the patch message today:</p><p><ul><i>- Fixed a long-standing bug that was causing Feign Death to fail when several characters were on the NPC's hate list along with the character using Feign Death. We'd like to extend much thanks to the monk community who helped us track this one down. Also fixed a problem with the monk's 'Block' skill which inadvertantly was recapped at a lower than normal skill level in recent months. Kudos to "Faned" of the "Monkly Business" bulletin board who brow-beat Gordon with the facts until he gave in and looked at the code.</i></ul></p><p>Normally I would be leaping around the room right now in happiness, but instead I can barely see to type this through the tears. I'm sitting here watching the news, and the second tower of the World Trade Center just collapsed. The loss of life must number in the 10s of thousands, in what is without a doubt the greatest peace-time terrorist attrocity the world has ever seen. I am not an American myself, but that does not mean my heart doesnt feel the pain.</p><p>It puts it all into perspective, doesnt it, right now I couldnt care less about Feign Death.

The Paypal link is removed. Thanks to your generosity, I have covered another couple of months bandwidth costs. Once again I am amazed at the response.</p><p>The good news is, I have booked a week off of work in september. If I havnt managed to move the site to the new location, and recode it to allow dynamic updates, so I can hire a team of reporters, by then, then I vow that I will spend that week off doing the work!</p><p>This will mean, MUCH more regular site updates, of both news and articles, a monk equipment database, and more, and hopefully cheaper costs for me to run.

... the Paypal link for donations is back up again.</p><p>The site is obviously a popular resource for information, because even during the periods I dont update very much, I still get over 500,000 hits per month. Unfortunately, those hits cost me money. Quite a lot of money. Bandwidth is not cheap these days.</p><p>So, if you can drop me a couple of dollars via the paypal link at the bottom of the menu on the left, I sure would appreciate it. I would hate to lose the site because I couldnt pay my bills. I wont profit from the money, once my costs are covered, the link will be removed.

Just as well I removed all the links to the members only area of the copyrighted information (see post below), because the link no longer works, he must have moved the page to another address. I wonder why he had to do that?

I just received the following by email:</p><p><ul>To whom it may concern,</p><p>My name is Craig Baldwin and I am the owner of www.everquestbugs.com .  I noticed on one of your message threads someone was giving out my members URL for anyone to access a my paid service.  I ask that you close this message thread because the information contained on the members URL is copyright protected.  Handing out this URL for free violates this proctection.  I don't even mind if you just remove the link to the members area and leave the rest of the messages intact.  I just need the my members URL removed from your message thread.</p><p>The message thread that contains this information on your website is <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=10901.topic">here</a></p><p>Thank you for your time and understanding.  Please respond to this email.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Craig Baldwin<br>

<p>Seems someone on my boards posted a link to the '<a href="http://www.everquestbugs.com/321/eqmembers/sluggo/hideout.html">members area</a>' of this so called <a href="http://www.everquestbugs.com/321/eqmembers/sluggo/hideout.html">everquest bugs</a> website. People are paying $20 a time for this <a href="http://www.everquestbugs.com/321/eqmembers/sluggo/hideout.html">service</a>, and yet this guy has no control whatsoever over who accesses the <a href="http://www.everquestbugs.com/321/eqmembers/sluggo/hideout.html">page</a>. No kind of secure login, just an unsecure, static, <a href="http://www.everquestbugs.com/321/eqmembers/sluggo/hideout.html">html page</a>.</p>
<p>However, he claims that this information about a sony product is copyrighted by him personally, so I had better be very careful and remove all <a href="http://www.everquestbugs.com/321/eqmembers/sluggo/hideout.html">links</a> to the site immediately before he sends in his army of lawyers.</p>So, whatever you do, you must NOT go to <a href="http://www.everquestbugs.com/321/eqmembers/sluggo/hideout.html">this link</a> because it contains copyrighted information regarding everquest, and despite the fact that it is publicly accessable via an insecure, open access html page, you will get in trouble for violating copyright.<p><p>Oh, incase you missed it.....<a href="http://www.everquestbugs.com/321/eqmembers/sluggo/hideout.html">DONT CLICK HERE</a></p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>The Donations have been very generous indeed, and I have covered my costs for the last 2 or 3 months worth of bandwidth charges, and for that I am very grateful. A MASSIVE thank you to everyone who sent me cash, no matter if it was $1 or $100. I am removing the paypal link.</p><p>Unfortunately I had a total system wipeout thanks to Anarchy Online, and I have lost a lot of data. I managed to recover most everything, but the main thing I have lost was all the 'pending' submissions to the site. If you have submitted anything in the last couple of months which has not been included on the site yet, then PLEASE resend it to me</p><p>Work on the new site coding is progressing nicely.</p></p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p><u>The Good news:</u> I have resolved my hosting issues. I received literally hundreds of emails offering advice and hosting solutions, and I picked one which I am very happy with, which will give me all the asp and SQL support I need, at a very good price.</p><p><u>The Bad News:</u> Work is keeping me very busy at the moment, I havnt had a day off in 3 weeks, and on several occasions I have worked 30+ hour shifts. Finding time to recode the new site so I can switch to the new host has been impossible. The news system is nearly finished, but the articles system and the Equipment Database still need to be done. I dont know how long its gonna be before I can switch over, and in the mean time, the bills just keep on coming (new one arrived yesterday).</p><p>So, I have decided to take the advice of Lum the Mad, and put up a paypal donations link for a while each month. To me this is the best way of raising cash, as it is entirely optional, and I *HATE* ad-banners.</p><p>So, if you want to put in a dollar or 2 (or 10) towards keeping the site going, click on the link at the bottom of the menu on the left side. I'll keep track of the account, and once I have covered my costs for the month, I'll remove the link.</p><p>In the meantime, I am sorry about the lack of updates, but I ask you to be patient, once the new code is written and I move to the new server, news and articles will be handled by a staff of reporters, and updates should be fast and furious. Keep submitting stuff, it is all being stored up for inclusion.</p></p></FONT></ul>

<ul>
<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>OK, I'm sorry, and you can stop sending the 'are you alive' emails now. I went through a bad patch at work, and the last thing you want to do after spending a nice 16 hour day coding and scripting, is go home, and do some more coding and scripting, so the site was neglected for a while, and I am sorry.</p><p>However, I am putting up this article because I have a problem. My problem is the $300 bill I have to pay for the excess bandwidth I used in the last 2 months. I can't figure it out, I stopped updating the site, and my bandwidth usage, which had been under 2gb/month, leapt up to 6gb in march, and then 8gb in April. I've already gone well over my allowance for May, and its only the 12th, I'm going to get another bill at the end of the month for that too.</p><p>So, Ive done some work on the site today, to try and reduce bandwidth. The server status will now only update once every 10 minutes, not every time you load a new page, this change was necessary to help with the problem. Also all the large files on the site (namely the excel files and the pictures in the humour section) have been moved off the server</p><p>These changes will hopefully mean a large reduction in the bandwidth I use, saving me some money, but I have another problem.</p><p>I recently learned asp and sql programming, and have some wonderful ideas for the site that you would all love. A team of reporters able to submit articles, meaning multiple news articles per day. Searchable databases of monk equipment, and more. Sounds good eh?</p><p>But wait, I said I had a problem, and the problem is this: My site is hosted on a unix box with php support, not asp, and I dont know any php.</p><p>Hopefully, with someone's help, I can solve both problems in 1 go. I need a server, a nice fast server supporting asp and sql. I'm hoping one of you monks out there is the server admin at an ISP, or something like that, and can host my site for a reduced price, or perhaps even for free?</p><p>If things keep going the way they are right now, I will not be able to afford to keep the site going for much longer. I am not going to add ad-banners, or pop-ups, or ask for donations, or make the site pay-per-view. I would rather take the site down than do something like that, I just need a nice cheap hosting solution, and I will swallow my costs so far.</p></FONT></ul>

I counted them up today, and I received over 100 'get well soon' emails. I didnt reply to any of them, there were simply too many, but that certainly doesnt mean I didnt appeciate them.</p><p>Anyway. A new quest guide has been added (Bracer of Hammerfall) and Zinj's equipment spreadsheet has been updated with new items. I have a few more things to update, which will probably be done on Thursday.</p><p>I attended the monk BotB final on Test a few weeks ago, but unfortunately all the screenshots I took came out unusable (400+ of them, all so dark that you cant see a thing, dont know why the hell it happened), so I cannot do the type of article I was intending to, instead I may just put up a simple table showing who beat who in what round. If you are interested in seeing highlights of the event, castersrealm put up a video yesterday, follow the link on the links page if you want to go and download it, but its a 46mb file, so you had better have a fast connection.</p></FONT></ul>
