<p>Removed the JBoot guide, and added it as a post to the Guides and Tactics section for people to comment on and update. No one has sent me a better one yet, so post your comments (or your own guide) there.

<p>What else? Still missing a well detailed Feign Death guide, detailed  hunting zone guides, Suggested Alternate Skill point recomendations (including details of what amount of points does what), or anything else you feel like.</p>

          <p class="MB_Body"><p>Still havent fixed the fact that if I take off my coat or zone I become a moustachioed monstrosity, but here we are on todays roundup:

<p><ul>December 13th, 12:00am
<br>------------------------------

<p>** Texture Cache **

<p>In an effort to improve loading and zoning times, we've added the ability to cache textures to your hard drive. One of the things that your computer is doing when you load up the game or change zones is building textures and putting them into RAM on your computer. Each time you log in or zone the game has to create the textures you need and put them into RAM for use during gameplay.

<p>This, obviously, takes a little time.

<p>We have added an option that allows you to save that information to your hard drive rather than creating it each time you log in or zone.

<p>This does have a few drawbacks. It will require a lot of hard drive space to store these textures. In the most extreme case it could use up as much as 1.5 GB of hard drive space, though this would be the extreme. It could, however, easily use 500 MB of space on your hard drive. And because writing all this data to your hard drive takes a little time, the first time you use this feature it will take a bit longer to log in.

<p>The game will never allow you to fall below 500 MB of space on your hard drive when creating the texture cache. This is to prevent any problems with a shortage of space on your hard drive. But it also means that you will need to have plenty of hard drive space free to use this option; 500 MB plus the amount needed for the texture cache.

<p>Also, if you change any of your setting for graphics {like changing the texture quality) it will have to rewrite these files, meaning that your first log in after making such a change will take longer than usual as it writes these files to your hard drive.

<p>The benefits is that once you have allocated the hard drive space and logged in to create the needed files, the game can then read that information directly into RAM from your hard drive rather than creating them each time you log in or zone.

<p>What this feature does not allow you to do is to increase the settings above those that are recommended. If the game suggests that you only use ten models, turning on the Texture Cache will not make it a good idea to turn on more models. This feature will not change that. Those recommendations are based on the amount of RAM you have available and your video card. The hard drive cache does not effectively add RAM to your machine, it just allows the game to save time creating the textures that your existing RAM and video card use.

<p>There are two ways to activate this feature. You can check the 'Texture Cache' box in the Options screen, or you can turn it on from within the eqclient.ini file. To activate it, add the following line to the eqclient.ini file:

<p>TextureCache=TRUE

<p>This could improve load times dramatically depending on your settings. The more models and graphics features you have turned on, the greater the potential increase in loading times you will see using the Texture Cache.

<p>Remember: This will require a lot of hard drive space, so be certain that you have a lot of free hard drive space if you turn this option on. The more stuff you enable (models, texture quality, etc.) the more space you will need.

<p>We expect this to be of greatest benefit to folks with 256 megs of RAM and a lot of hard drive space. The more RAM your system has, the less benefit you should expect to see by using the texture cache.


<p>* Patch Changes *

<p>- Fixed a pathing problem in the waters of Acrylia Caverns <br>
- More fixes for face and hair issues: Most notably a bug with Erudite male hair color arrows changing the hair style instead of the color.<br>
- Fixed a problem that was causing the % to crash some people when using in tells.
<br>- Addressed several potential crash bugs.

Unfortunatly let down by my inability to remember my password to host the images, but I will fix that as soon as I can - Sorry!

<br>------------------------------

<p>* Patch Changes *

<p>- Several changes to hair functionality: Expanded beard color choices for Erudite males, pushed back the camera a bit for human males when making hair selections (so they can see themselves) and fixed it so that the camera will no longer rotate around Erudites while in hair selection mode of character creation. Also fixed a bug with the left selection arrow sometimes not changing hair color.
<br><br> - Fixed the "Entering Luclin" message bug. This was only an errant text message, it was not causing any crashes or keeping anyone out of the game.
<br><br> - Fixed a bug where Vah Shir with an intelligence over a certain amount could not be created.
<br><br> - Fixed a bug with faction-affecting items: They were giving a bonus to all factions instead of just the intended faction
<br><br> - Fixed a problem with arrows and quivers that would result in the person being logged out.
<br><br> - Adjusted the cost of Combine Platemail to be inline with its stats and other armor available within game.
<br><br> - Made several gameplay changes to The Grey. A single group having the ability to simultaneously engage and prevail against 35+ experience-giving creatures is not in line with the desire for risk vs. reward and the promotion of balanced groups.
<br><br> - Removed some bad NPCs in Chardok.
<br><br> - Tuned encounters in The Fungus Grove, Maiden's Eye, and Dawnshroud Peaks.
<br><br> - Clarified some quest dialog in Sanctus Seru.
<br><br> - Tuned The Deep, also improved the variety of drops.
<br><br> - Improved pathing in The Temple of Ssraeshza
<br><br> - Improved pathing in Sanctus Seru
<br><br> - Improved pathing in Echo Caverns
<br><br> - Added some newbie beastlord quests in the old world.
<br><br> - Removed the "Lore" tag from the "Darkened Knight's Bracer" </ul>
