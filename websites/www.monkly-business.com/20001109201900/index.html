<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Reports have come in that the epic quest has been completed on Test. Some people doubt the validity of the information, but I have my reasons to believe it as true.</p><p>Here is the big scoop, the final item is NOT a weapon, it's a pair of gloves.</p><p><b><ul>Celestial Fists<br>AC: 15<br>STR +20, STA +10, AGI +10, DEX +10, HPs +100, Sv vs Disease +10, Sv vs Poison +10, Sv vs Magic +10, Sv vs Cold +10, Sv vs Fire +10<br>Effect: Celestial Tranquility<br>Weight 0.1</p></b></ul><p>The good news is that being gloves, the particle effect is on both fists. I dont have a picture as yet, but reports are it's a nice looking effect.</p>The bad news is that it isn't a weapon. Rogues and Warriors both got weapons that increased their damage output by a decent amount. Seeing as most monks 50+ will be max hasted from being grouped with enchanters/bards most of the time anyway, the haste effect is largly meaningless, so all we get is some AC, HPs and Stats, effectively a minimal (from the str) increase in damage output.</p><p>2 notes need to be made:</p><p>1. The quest is still not completable on the live servers, and will not be until the next patch</p><p>2. Before you go totally mad over this, lets wait until the effect is fully tested. Yes I know what the effect does as listed in the spdat.eff file (12ac, 40str, 40% haste) but Verant have played games before, the effect may be completely different, lets wait and see.</p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Sorry everyone</p><p>First I was ill, then it was the weekend, and then I had a bad week at work (servers going down, thieves stealing 7 computers, Directors being demanding). The result is that I've been too busy to do an update. I have a load of stuff to put up, and will TRY and find some time to do it tomorrow, but no promises.</p><p>Oh, and yet another Perl programmer has blown out on me, and I am looking for another. If you know Perl, mySQL and Apache, and would be willing to help me by writing a few scripts, please let me know</p><p>Oh, one last thing, the monkly-business email address is being forwarded to another ISP, who seem to have deleted my email account. I will change the redirect when I can find the time, but for now, please email everything to me <a href="mailto:s.blackery@btinternet.com">here</a> instead. Thank you</p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>As some of you may have noticed, Jekhar's 'Relentless Monks' zone guides are now broken links. Seems he stopped playing EQ and took the site down. Someone did send me a copy of those guides a while back, but I threw them away, being content at the time to just link to them.</p><p>If anyone has a copy of those guides, could you please send them to me.</p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Caldwyn of Sol Ro sent me a guide to obtaining the sash/headband components, and Congdar Fui sent me an updated version of his guide. Rather than have 2 guides, I have combined them together</p><p>So check out the new sash/headband guide in the Quest Guides section. I think you will agree it is pretty comprehensive now.<p>Also added in the Quest Guides section is Bodi's guide to the Robe of the Whistling Fist.</p><p>Bodi also sent me a link to a guide to the new monk epic quest. This is a work in progress, with all the information up to what we know so far, and with a lot of missing images. I dont want to put incomplete guides up, so I am just going to put a link <a href="http://www.geocities.com/kibadachi_uk/monkepicquest.htm" target ="_blank">here</a> for now, so you can all read up on the current situation and <a href="mailto:bodi.bojangles@cwcom.net?subject=Pictures for the epic quest">email</a> him if you have any of the pictuers he is missing.</p><p>Once it is complete I will add it to the Quest Guides section.</p></FONT></ul>
