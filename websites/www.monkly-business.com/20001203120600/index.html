<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Patch day comes around again. This one looks good for us monks!</p><p>A few snippets from the patch message:</p><p><b>Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum. Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction.</b></p><p>This one affected everyone, but its good news for us monks, as this bug made building some factions very difficult. Now Human monks will be accepted in Cabilis more easily, and Iksar monks will have a MUCH easier time building many factions, including those with humans</p><p><b>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill.</b></p>YES! Finally. It only took 6 months of complaining, but with the advent of the new Celestial Fists encouraging us to use Hand to Hand skill, it could no longer be ignored. WTG Verant for finally listening.</p><p>Anyway, servers will be down for a while, why not pop into the <a href="/chat/index.html">chat room</a> to discuss these changes while we wait?</p></FONT></ul>

I'm sorry if I didn't respond to your email, I tried to, but there were too many.</p><p>Thankfully, I had all the website files and ftp settings stored on my Mac at work as well as on my PC at home, so all is well on that front.</p><p>Well, I finally got around to doing a small update, and put Bodi's guide to the 'epic' Celestial Fists quest for Monks on the <a href="/quests/index.html">Quest Guides</a> page.</p><p>Enjoy!</p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Yesterday was quite possibly the worst day of my life.</p><p>It started innocently enough, with an average day at work, followed by an entertaining evening with some friends, but the story starts at about 10.30pm when I headed back to where my motorbike was parked (I ride a 600cc Bandit) to drive home.</p><p>Some car driver had hit my bike (parked in a bike bay on the side of the road) and then just driven off. About $2000 of damage. I did the standard things and went to the police to report the incident, so by the time I got home (by taxi) it was 00.30am.</p><p>I opened the door to my house to discover the place turned over. My PC that I use to play EQ on stolen, along with other electical appliances (TV, Video etc, etc) and the place looking like a scene from World War III.</p><p>So I called the Police out, and by the time they had arrived, looked the place over, taken a statement, filled in all the paperwork etc etc it was 4.00am.</p><p>I went to bed. Let me tell you, it is a VERY freaky experience trying to sleep in  a house that has just been broken into.</p><p>So, I get up for work at 7.00am, and realise I dont have a bike to ride into work on, and no cash to get a taxi, so I get dressed and head to the Bank. I put my card in the cash machine, which promptly swallows it, gives some lame excuse about a technical fault, and then sits there smugly staring at me.</p><p>I am a strong believer in Karma, and someone somewhere owes me BIG for last night. I think I'll go buy a lottery ticket....</p></FONT></ul>
