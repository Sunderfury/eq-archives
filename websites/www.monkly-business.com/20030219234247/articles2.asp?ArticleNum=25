1. INTRODUCTION:
</P
<p>
Monks are the melee kings/queens of EverQuest; and along with Rogues, are often referred to as human DOTs (Damage Over Time spells). Although relatively weak compared to other classes, monks have several pros and cons; but starting out is not all that easy. Our disadvantages shine before our advantages do. In the beginning our attack and defense is average for a melee. The exceptional dual wield is nice and helps a ton with our damage potential but we cannot out damage another melee until about level 30.  Rogues over level 10 attacking from behind a mob will always outdamage monks by 20%.  The problem being is we are a melee with low ac and hp with average damage output means monsters (MOBs) will turn on us now and again and kill us much more quickly than a warrior or hybrid with spells. Monks are not tanks like warriors; we just don't have the hit points, and warriors can wear better, heavier armor. However, a team made up of a monk, a warrior, druid or shaman or enchanter, rogue or bard, wizard or magician, and a cleric, is going to be some of the best fun you've every hand playing with.  And a Monk/Shaman duo cannot be described; only experienced!
</p>
<p>
Advantages: Monks are the only melee class able to engage in combat while naked and stand any chance of surviving the battle. This, in combination with skill-based Feign Death (Level 17) and Sneak (Level 8), make monks one of the best classes for splitting groups of monsters before pulling the single mob back to their group; and in retrieving corpses after a battle gone bad. These also make monks, in conjunction with Rogues and Rangers, the best class for scouting unknown areas. Monks get a skill called Safe Fall, making accidental jumps, falls, and unexpected drop-offs not only survivable, but in many cases, completely harmless. Monks get a level-based increase on their hand-to-hand attacks, strength increases on damage after level 20, and reduction in attack delays after level 25.
</p>
<p>
Disadvantages: Until monks get the Feign Death skill at level 17, they are the weakest melee class. They only get a moderate amount of hit points. Young monks start out with a penalty for having 15 or more pounds of weight; and incur an increasing AC penalty with more weight. Monks less than level 20, carrying weight equal to their encumbrance weight, lose about 25% of their AC; and the penalty is supposedly greater the higher a monk gets. However, monks cut off point for weight increases with level so a level 25 monk can carry up to 16 pounds; higher levels can carry more.
</p>
<p>Level 1-14:   <15 No Penalty
</p>
<p>Level 15-29:  <16 No Penalty
</p>
<p>Level 30-44:  <17 No Penalty
</p>
<p>Level 45-50:  <18 No Penalty
</p>
<p>Level 51-54:  <19 No Penalty
</p>
<p>Level 55-59:  <21 No Penalty
</p>
<p>Level 60:  <25 No Penalty
<p>
Miscellaneous:
Monks do not heal while running (no surprise), and heal 1 point per clock tick while standing or feign dead until they reach level 50. A sitting (resting) humank monk heals 2 points per tick until level 20, when they heal at 3 points per tick. 4 points at level 30, 5 points at level 40, 6 points at level 50, and 7 points at level 60. Also at level 60, it doesn't matter if a monk is standing or sitting - they heal at 7 points per tick. Iksar monks heal even faster.
