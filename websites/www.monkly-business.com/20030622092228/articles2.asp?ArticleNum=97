          <ul>
            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              <p> This is from the perspective of a level 60 monk so aggro on pulling may be a little different for lower levels. As far as killing stuff - I am a Rallos monk with "ghetto" gear (we spend too much time killing each other to get uber stuff - hehe) Heck - I am still wearing a FBSS and a Vox bracer. 

<p><b>Copper Ring - 1 AC, 1 STR, 1 SV magic nodrop lore : </b>To do this part solo as a monk you need to kill lots of snow cougars and tundra kodiaks. You need 2 HQ cougar pelts and 2 HQ kodiak pelts. The kodiak pelts are the most rare and can take hours to get 2 of them sometimes. I see them being auctioned for 1 K on a regular basis on Rallos. The best area to hunt for these is just west of the Icy Ocean bridge all the way to Garadains dwarf camp. I have found that if you do not see any kodiaks (there are always plenty of cougars) just start killing everything that moves. 

<p>You will get some kodiaks to spawn soon. Once you get 2 pelts of each - get your sewing kit and combine to make a coldain blanket. The blanket is nodrop-lore. I would advise getting your skill up to at least 80ish before making these. It is a real pain to fail making this blanket and have to hunt for more pelts. I have made the blanket with only 35 skill - but that was a lucky try. Maybe a success rate at this level. If you dont want to get tailoring skill up - have a high level tailor make the blanket for you and you can Multi-quest at the 2nd ring step. Once you have the blanket - turn it in to Garadain Glacierbane at /loc &#8211;2713, -382 for your copper ring. If you are KOS to dwarfs - invis and sneak or FD and sneak work just fine.

<p><b>Silver Ring - 2 AC, 2 STR, 2 SV magic nodrop lore :</b> Target Garadain and say, "what assistance?" He will give you a dull axe. You need to give this axe to Boradain Glacierbane to start this part of the quest. He is at /loc -2463, 1537 and he has a 3 hour respawn time. If he is not up - then somebody did this part within the last 3 hours. When you give the axe to Boradain - he wanders around to several checkpoints before he spawns a Rabid tundra kodiak that you must kill for the pelt. 

<p>The main checkpoints are the giant fort, the prison area and the orc fort. At each check point he has some sort of dialogue. When he is wandering - he will aggro on any giant or orc - and they will aggro on him. You must keep him alive. He can take only a few hits from a giant before he dies. To do this solo as a monk - it is easiest to kill the two static guards at the giant fort. Pull each one solo and kill using ID kiting. If the Giant Captain is standing out front - a few choices - you can wait for him to wander back inside the fort before starting the quest - or you can aggro him and pull him to Garadains camp, FD and let the dwarfs kill him - or just before Boradain gets to the gate you can aggro the Captain and pull him out of Boradains path - FD then keep FDing until the captain is no longer aggro on you. I cant solo the Captain - so these are my choices. I prefer to just wait till the captain wanders back inside and then give the axe to Boradain - this way I never have to leave Boradains side and I can always protect him from wandering giants and orcs.
 
<p>The next main checkpoint is an easy giant and an orc at the prison area. I usually just run a little bit ahead of Boradain and start killing these guys getting them BOTH aggro on me. Boradain will assist you. Then Boradain makes a long walk to the orc fort with a rest stop in between. Again - I usually just run a little bit ahead and get BOTH orcs at the gate aggro on me and kill them with Boradain assisting me. If there is a group camping the fort and pulling out the front gate - warn them ahead of time that you are passing through and to hold pulls for a few minutes. Also if someone in their group is KOS to dwarfs - they need to move for a few minutes. Boradain eventually goes back to where he started and spawns the rabid kodiak. I usually pull the kodiak so that I am killing the kodiak right next to Boradain. That way if any wandering giants or orcs aggro on Boradain during the fight - I can get them aggro on me so that Boradain stays alive. 

<p>Kill the kodiak - loot the pelt and hand it to Boradain before he despawns. Bordain will give you a broken axe. Take the broken axe and your copper ring to Garadain and the last person to hand in either item will get a silver ring. For those of you that have done this part &#8211; you know that it takes a good 20 &#8211; 25 minutes because the dwarf walks so slow. Here is a tip that can speed things up if you know all the checkpoints. 

<p><b>WARNING</b> &#8211; only do this if you are absolutely sure of all the checkpoints &#8211; even the ones where he either just says something or sits and rests. Once he clears a checkpoint get him to the next checkpoint faster by you aggroing an orc or a giant and letting Boradain aggro on him then just running to the next checkpoint then kill what ever you have at the next checkpoint. This way Boradain runs between checkpoints instead of walking.

<p><b>Gold Ring &#8211; 3 AC, 3 STR, 3 SV magic nodrop lore:</b>  For this part you need to combine 1 HQ walrus pelt, 1 rhino horn and 1 skinning stone in a forge to make a coldain skinning knife. The best area for the horn and skin is the jail area because this spot has both rhinos and walruses in the same area. You can also find walruses by the Kael zone and rhinos throughout the zone. The skinning stone is just a random spawn on the ground anywhere in EW. With all your running around in the zone &#8211; you will see some. Just pick them up. Or you can auction to the zone that you are looking for them and you will probably get some help.

<p>The stones are nodrop &#8211; but the knife you make is not nodrop. It takes about a 50 skill level in smithing to make the knife &#8211; it only takes about an hour to get this skill level. If you have someone smith it for you &#8211; they need to find a skinning stone. This is probably the easiest step to MQ, because you can give the knife to anyone. You give the silver ring and the knife to Garadain to get the gold ring. I always have a bunch of knifes premade so that I am always ready to MQ this step &#8211; they are not lore.

<p><b>Platinum Ring &#8211; 4 AC, 4 STR, 4 SV magic, nodrop lore: </b>If you follow the quest dialogue &#8211; Garadain gives you a note to give to Tain Hammerfrost. This is not necessary, the note is worthless. Just go find Tain at loc -4950, -2650 and you can start this part of the quest by targeting Tain and saying, &#8220;I can help&#8221; But dont say this until you are ready. Normally when you say this 4 giants come running over the hill from the East and attack Tain and kill him. With a group you kite the giants and someone peels the named giant Ghrek off the kiter - kill Ghrek &#8211; loot the frozen elixir and give it to Tain before he is dead or despawned. 

<p>As a monk solo &#8211; I say the trigger phrase &#8211; I back up a lot &#8211; the giants have a huge aggro radius. The giants come over the hill and kill Tain. As they come over the hill &#8211; I try to target Ghrek. It is kind of hard from a distance &#8211; but just keep trying till you get him targeted. I use a long range pulling device like javelins. This is the only way I can get him solo. If you are too close you will aggro the others. Dont worry about Tain getting killed &#8211; just get Ghrek solo and I take him to Garadains dwarf camp. I usually take him wide so that just the coldain lookout and a few others aggro on the giant and beat him down a bit. If Garadain and the whole camp aggros on him &#8211; the dwarfs will KS you. Depending on Ghreks level &#8211; I can sometimes almost solo him if I get ID to work a lot &#8211; but this way &#8211; I try to get the dwarfs to beat him to about half. Hopefully &#8211; if you figure it right he will kill the dwarfs and you can finish him off. 

<p>This is something you will need to play with &#8211; it is more of an art than a science. I imagine uber level 60 monks on blue servers can solo this guy &#8211; and lower level monks will need to figure out which dwarf combination will get Ghrek down to quarter health. Anyway &#8211; kill loot frozen elixir. Then when Tain respawns in 3 hours take the elixir and say the trigger phrase, &#8220; I can help&#8221; then give him the elixir to get the coldain hammer from Tain. YOU MUST SAY THE TRIGGER PHRASE FIRST! Before you hand him the elixir or he wont give you hammer. Once you have the hammer &#8211; give the hammer and the gold ring to Garadain for your Platinum ring.

<p><b>Obsidian Ring : 5 AC, 5 STR, 5 SV magic, nodrop lore:</b> For this part you first need the Rygorr invasion plans off the orc messenger. You can just sit outside the gate of the orc fort and the messenger will eventually run into you. He is an easy kill &#8211; loot invasion plans. You can also auction for the plans. Many of orc fort campers have a set of plans. When you hand the plans to the Coldain lookout at /loc -2615, -500 this will spawn the named orc Scarbow GaHruk and about 6 other orcs just West of the camp about 100 yards.

<p>If you do this with a group &#8211; just kill them all. Solo as a monk &#8211; I spawn them &#8211; from a long distance I target Scarbow and use a javelin to pull him solo. Normally &#8211; Scarbow and the other orcs run to the Garadain camp and wipe it out. You must pull Scarbow before he gets to the dwarf camp or the dwarfs will KS you. I can solo Scarbow pretty easy using mend, innerflame and fear kiting. The other orcs will run to the dwarf camp, wipe it out and despawn. Kill Scarbow and loot his head. You will need to wait for Garadain to respawn in about 25 minutes because the orcs killed him. If you are spawning the orcs solo &#8211; make sure to warn anyone near the dwarf camp to move or die. When Garadain respawns &#8211; give him Scarbow head and platinum ring for the Obsidian ring.

<p><b>Mithril Ring : 6AC, 6 STR, 6 SV magic, nodrop lore: </b>First of all you need to kill the traitor dwarf Rodrick. He spawns at /loc &#8211;3407, 1042 He is a rare spawn. Just outside the hut where Rodrick spawns &#8211; the rygorr emissary will spawn first. He will talk and walk around for a bit &#8211; then he will spawn Rodrick and walk off to the orc fort. Dont aggro the emissary &#8211; wait for him to leave. Then kill Rodrick and loot his head and the dagger ( the dagger is needed for the 9th ring ). Rodrick is not that tough. If the emissary is not aggroed by anyone &#8211; a lot of times he will come back and spawn another Rodrick. It is totally random. I once saw the emissary spawn 10 Rodricks in a row. 

<p>It seems like I have never seen the messenger up when the emissary is up &#8211; so I always try to make sure the messenger is dead if I am camping Rodrick. On Rallos &#8211; the roderik spawn seems to get broken if it has been a while since a server reset or patch. He will not spawn at all for some reason. But right after a patch &#8211; Rodrick is spawning all the time &#8211; that is the pattern I have noticed. 

<p>You also need a kromzek note off Poxbreath Yellowfang. To do this solo as a monk &#8211; wait till 11 PM EQ time and Korrigan the dwarf ghost will spawn at /loc &#8211;7938, 3284. Give the ghost your 5th ring and that will trigger Icefang to take a zig-ziag route to the orc camp by the bridge. You get the 5th ring back. You need to do this at night or Icefang will not spawn the orcs at the bridge camp if it is too close to morning. As soon as Icefang starts off running - you run to the orc camp by the bridge at /loc &#8211;3400, -4330. You need to get there before Icefang &#8211; but that is not too hard with Jboots.

<p>I also will usually /ooc to the zone not to kill Icefang because he is for a quest. He usually makes it on his own &#8211; sometimes if he runs into enough orcs &#8211; he wont make it. About 30 seconds before Icefang gets to the bridge orc camp &#8211; Pox will spawn with about 5 Oracles. I usually stand far away because the new orcs have a pretty big aggro radius. To get Pox solo &#8211; I run a wide circle around to the back of the hut staying about 100 EQ yards away from the hut. Then I will walk SLOWLY towards the back of the hut until Pox aggros on me. He should come alone &#8211; then kill. You need to do this before Icefang gets to the orcs and aggros them all. If Icefang gets there before you pull Pox &#8211; use a long range pulling device like a javelin to try to get Pox alone out of the fight. Pox solo is a pretty easy kill &#8211; if you get his friends &#8211; run for the zone or FD. The oracles are shamans and they have SOW. Loot the note off Pox and return to Garadain. Give Garadain the Rodrick head, the note and your 5th ring for you Mithril ring.

<p><b>Adamantium Ring: 7AC, 7 STR, 7 SV magic, nodrop lore: </b>First you need to kill Warden Bruke for a shackle key. Go to /loc 300, -360. And you will either see a prison guard place holder or Warden. If you see a PH &#8211; clear them till you get Warden to spawn. They have about a 10 min respawn. Once you have Warden &#8211; you need to pull him through the back wall of the building. If you dont &#8211; you will get jumped by all his friends. So target him &#8211; run behind the building &#8211; use your favorite pulling spell ( I use pumice ) and he will come through the wall alone. Then I kite him to the dwarf camp west of the jail area at about /loc &#8211;100, 2300. I let the dwarfs there beat him down a bit. If Warden is green to me at level 60 &#8211; this is usually enough for me to finish him off. If he is blue to me &#8211; I usually take him to the Garadain camp. 

<p>Once again &#8211; with all this dwarf assisting &#8211; it is more of an art than a science &#8211; you may need to experiment a bit. Or if a lot of people are in the zone &#8211; just get someone to heal you. But this is a solo guide &#8211; hehe. Once you have the shackle key &#8211; you need to clear all the giants and orcs at the area west of the Warden spawn. There is dwarf sitting in the back of the building &#8211; Corbin Blackwell. Once you have cleared the orcs and giants, give him your 6th ring and the shackle key. This will start him walking towards Dobbin Crossaxe dwarf camp at /loc &#8211;570, -3179. 

<p>About halfway there &#8211; he gets ambushed by a lot of giants and orcs. Normally, it takes a full group to keep Corbin alive. But as a monk solo &#8211; as soon as he spawns the ambush ( the giants shout out once they are spawned ) you hit Corbin and aggro him and pull him towards the shore away from the ambush. You need to pull him the right way because the ambush comes from 3 sides &#8211; leaving only one escape route. Once you are to the shore, FD and keep Fding until aggro is clear. Then he will walk to Dobbin and despawn. If you are having trouble clearing aggro &#8211; just wait till Corbin despawns &#8211; then pop up and run to Dobbin and give him your 6th ring for a note. Dont give Dobbin your ring until AFTER Corbin despawns. Give this note to Garadain for your Adamantium ring.

<p>I have not figured out how to do the other rings solo, but there are plenty of guides and threads on these rings. Most of the info here is not new either. It is just an explanation of how I do all these steps solo late at night when hardly anyone is online and I am bored. I just do these steps for friends and guildmates. You can do every step solo for someone then MQ the 8th ring for someone else by just letting them loot the chiefs head and having them loot the chiefs head and having them turn it in to Garadain during the war.
