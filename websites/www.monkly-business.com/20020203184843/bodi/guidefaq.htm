    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">I receive many emails, mostly asking the
      same questions over and over, so thought I would compile a FAQ to deal
      with them. It only relates to quests that I have written, plus a few other
      Monk related questions, and is just a small FAQ to help those who are just
      that little bit unsure. Please note that the guides are updated very
      frequently, and some have minor changes added to them or rewordings to
      make things clearer. I have started to add dates (shown as a version 
      number) to the bottom of the guides, so that you can check your printed
      off copy against the copy that is currently shown on my pages. </FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">There are many ways. By (lots of) faction
      work, creating a Human mule to hand in the pieces for you (as the
      Headbands/Sashes are not no drop) or by killing the Monk Grandmasters at
      the Freeport or Qeynos guildhouses. For faction work, try the:</FONT> </P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">You do not have sufficant faction. Spend a
      few hours in EC killing Orcs, and you should be fine. Freeport Monks,
      following Quelious, have no problems in getting Qeynos (Agnostic)
      Headbands.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Will my faction be good enough to talk
      to (or hand items into) Brother Qwinn/Zephyl?</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Both brothers are on Beta Neutral faction,
      and are not iffilated with the Ashen Hand or Silent Fist, and so will talk
      to anyone, regardless of race or belief.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Does Brother Qwinn/Zephyl drop the
      RotLC? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Yes, but do NOT kill Qwinn. Zephyl has a
      known Place holder, and can be forced to spawn, where Qwinn can take 3
      weeks to spawn even when the zone is being culled by waiting Monks. They
      both drop the robe, even when they are wearing the Shiver/Crescent looking
      Gi.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Do I know what force is required to
      take on any of the brothers?</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">No, and I dont want to know. If you wish
      to take this method, please check Monkly Business, some of our darker
      brethren will have posted tactics there to deal with them --Please do NOT
      kill Qwinn though.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Why is Brother Qwinn such a rare
      spawn? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">**shrugs** As mentioned, he can take weeks
      to spawn, but once up, is usually around for 5 days or so. Unless an uber
      guild with no manners kills him of course. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Is Raster a triggered Spawn? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">No. Just rare. He can spawn twice in one
      day, or not at all for many many weeks.</FONT> </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Can the RotLC be multiquested? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Yes. The RotLC no drop components, the
      Targin and Raster pieces can be handed in as another hands in the
      Headband/Sash. Please note: If you lose the items handed in while Multi
      questing, you will NOT be refunded. I lost my RotLC when I multi'd the
      RotWF, and had to do the quest again. Please be aware of this when multi
      questing anything.</FONT></P>

      your items.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Can the RotWF be multiquested? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Yes. But please be careful as Balatin
      breaks charm whenever he feels like it, and you can lose your robe. Please
      note: If you lose the items handed in while Multi questing, you will NOT
      be refunded. I lost my RotLC when I multi'd the RotWF, and had to do the
      quest again. Please be aware of this when multi questing anything,
      ESPECIALLY where Brother Balatin is concerned. </FONT></P>

      quest I want, what do I do? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Either have someone kill him, or wait for
      a server reset. I do not think he despawns. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Why did I not get the Bracer of
      Hamerfal? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Did you get xp and coin? If so, you did
      the quest right, and as mentioned, the Bracer is an uncommon reward. You
      do NOT get the bracer everytime. If you did not get the coin and xp, you
      must have handed in a wrong item or failed in your sneak attempt. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Does the Bracer of Hammerfal require
      Ally faction?</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"> No. It can be completed by sneaking on
      Sentry Kale, which will mean your faction will be indifferent. </FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">If you are under 53rd level, Lhaeo, when
      you tell him you will take responsibility, will tell you to hunt beetles
      or something similar. It has been confirmed that you can hand the items
      over anyway, and many Monks 50+ even when given that message have the book
      given to them. It has been confirmed that you will recive the book if you
      are under 50th (or at least 48th), but your fist change to damage and
      delay will NOT work until you are 51+.</FONT></P>

      Trunts Head into the OT Projection?</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">No. You can hand the head in at any time.
      I personally handed my Trunts Head in a week before my final fight.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Can I keep my robe till the final
      battle? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Yes. You can keep your robe. You fight all
      the fists, get the fang, then hand in your robe for the book. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>I am unsure about the book, who do I
      give it to and when? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The book section is confusing, but this is
      the order to do it in. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">1. Give Mad K the book called 'Celestial
      Fists' </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">2. He returns the book back to you, and
      attacks you </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">3. Feign death (or kill him) </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">4. The true K spawns, find him and give
      him the book </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">5. He tells you of the fists (Eejag and
      the others) and gives you the book called the 'Book of Celestial Fists' &lt;----
      Note the change. This book is now different. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">6. Now assuming you have done the fists
      and have the fang, give the book back to him. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">7. The True form will then ask for the
      demon fang. Give him the demon fang, and recieve your Celestial Fists. It
      is VERY confusing, but read it again until you understand, as at best you
      will lose your fang and have to fight the fists again, and at worst you
      could lose your robe. </FONT> </P>
