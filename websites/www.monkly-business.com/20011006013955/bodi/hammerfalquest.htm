      originates in the zone of Skyshrine, with a NPC called Sentry Kale. As
      with all of Skyshrine, he is on Claws of Veeshan faction, but even if KOS,
      a Monk can iniate this quest by the use of Sneak and Feign Death.<BR>
       <BR> Sentry Kale has 3 Quests, the <A HREF="dragontooth.htm">Dragon tooth
        choker</A>, a spider related one, and the Bracer of Hammerfal. He does
      not despawn/respawn, and the only way to get the quest you require is by
      killing him or waiting for server resets. He is roughly on a 30 min timer.</FONT></P>

        when you stand you will be right behind him. If your faction is bad, as
        soon as he turns after the iniatal hail, he will attack, so you need to
        hail him, feign, sneak, stand up, type the text, then feign again.</FONT><BR>

      doing a great service to the kin. As of late our supplies of velium ore
      have been growing short. We need to restock this supply but our normal
      source has run dry for the most part. Word has come to us that the Coldain
      are sitting on a large source of this ore and while we have no love for
      these Coldain, we have arranged a deal with one of their velium miners.
      Deliver this note along with a payment of 50 platinum to Ungdin, in the
      Coldain mines. Bring the velium shipment back to me and I will see about a
      reward. </FONT> </P>

      to Skyshrine, and hand Sentry Kale the Velium. Again, if your faction is
      bad, sneak behind him to complete the quest. I found that the best way to
      complete this quest is to attack Sentry Kale, run into the corridor, and
      feign, then when he turns to head back to his spawn point, hit sneak,
      stand up and give him the Ore.</FONT></P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">NOTE: The first time I did
      the quest, I failed and got nothing, no response, no message, just
      attacked by Sentry Kale --which was due to the fact that I did not sneak
      correctly, or mistimed the giving of the Velium to an NPC who dislikes me.
      <B>However, there is a good chance that the quest ends with no Bracer at
      all anyway, regardless of your faction.</B> You will get a thankyou
      message, but no bracer.</FONT></P>
