            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              <p>It had started as every evening started. Me and the other children ran into the streets after studing various skills all day and were ready to play before called back in by the lashing tounges of our mothers. As usual we played The Hunt. One of us was chosen to be the hunter and the rest of us would scatter to be found and "killed" by the hunter. it was early and we felt adventous that day so we let our game meander farther in to the Field of Bone than normal. My sister and I had found a place to hide and rest in the hills just outside town. We had been there only a few moments as the sun set before I decided to scout out and find where the 'Hunter" was. I placed my sister in what I thought was a well hidden place and set out. It didn't take long to find him. Seeing him head in the opposite direction from our hiding place I felt confident that we would not be found anytime soon. I quickly foraged for some berries and vegitables to hold my sister and I over till dinner that night and headed back to our hiding spot. 

<p>As I toped the rise near where my sister was hidden, a scream pierced my ears and chilled my blood to an unatural depth. I silently crept forward, fearful of what I would find. As I aproached the patch of brush where Lissar was hidden I made out several other forms. The light was low but they were definatly adults, 3 of them, one with a squirming bundle in his arms. I was less than 20 feet away and could hear snatches of thier conversation, something about a nice catch, and the others with this one would be a huge profit. I even heard the crunch of bone as the wiggling form apparently bit through the fingers of it's captor and my worse fears were confirmed as Lissar's voice rang in my ears as Master Ssturin's gong did on a daily basis," Stelik! Help! Stelik!.....". I watched from my hiding place as it happened. The screams echoing in the hills made my senses recoil. I was frozen, like a small animal caught in the beam of a bullseye lantern, terror halted me in place as they clubed Lissar into submission and began carring her off.

<p>A calm came over me then. Unlike anything I had experienced in Master Ssturin's dojo at the Court of Pain. A peace so profound, it was clear what I had to do. Gone was the terror that froze my bones, gone too was the fear that paralized my muscles. I wraped my tail gently around me and began my silent pursuit. I wanted to berate myself for getting talked into wandering so far from the walls of Cabilis, but there was no time for that. Only time to Hunt, and this was no longer a game with friends. I was about to kill or be killed to save my sister.

<p>As I got closer I braced myself for the tackle that would take one of the bastards down. I sprang, claws slashing, and took the first to the ground with little more that a light thud as he hit the ground, and rushed to my feet lightning fast. The other two bandits looked at me and then all three of us looked at the fallen, nameless Iksarian, blood pumping from his torn throat. His weak gasps dieing on the wind before even touching my ears. I crouched into a fighting stance, still feeling a perfect peace surrounding me. I felt completely centered for the first time in my short life that was surley about to end at the hands of these kidnappers.

<p>"Keep movin'. I'll take care of this whiff! You know where to meet.", The stocky one growled and answered my stance with one of his own.
 
<p>The other still struggling with my kicking and thrashing sister and nursing a wounded hand began to trot of into the dark.

<p>" Now BOY! Let us see what you are made of. It is easy to kill from behind. Can you face an opponent, look him in the eye, and rip his heart from his ribcage?". He studied me a moment longer and then shook his scaley head." Bah! you are less than a boy. Not even an initiate yet if my guess is right. I will let his death slide, I had no love for him, however you still need to be taught a lesson in manners. You will be lucky if I do not torture you for hours before joining my companion.". With that I heard metal slide along leather and saw the glint of light from a Chukta blade. Moving faster than I though possible, I felt the blade part scales and muscle to spill my life blood in several places. Dodging, fieghting, tumbling, blocking, jumping, rolling, I used every trick taught to me by the masters and still that wicked blade with it's small cuts found my scales at every turn, every twist. I was only prolonging the inevitable and I knew it. A smile spread across the bandits face as I realized how truly outmatched I was. He had known all along and was simply waiting for me to figure it out.

<p>Anger flared in my mind and anguish poured into my heart at the thought of this scavenger toying with me, and all the while my little sister being draged farthur and farthur away from me. No sooner did these feelings grasp me than they were swallowed by the void of peace within. It was all encompassing. I could no longer hear anything except the russle of leaves under my opponets feet, could see nothing except my foe before me, I felt complete health wash over me though I knew I would not survive the simple walk to town had the fight ended at that moment. As I watched this scum, preparing for my final rush, his face turned to puzzlement and then fear. He began backing away and then turned and ran. I looked behind me and saw Cserlain, the "Hunter", running full out with two of the city guards right behind him. A sad smile crossed my face as I slumped to the ground and all was black. 

<p>Over the next few months I aproached my training with a new attitude. I had been given a second chance to learn and I was not going to waste it. I made constant forays into the woods as the others children played, looking for signs of my sister. Thier games had lost the appeal they once had. I saw them now for what they really were, just another training tool to teach us to survive and to learn the basics of the real Hunt. I killed several more bandits and would-be smuglers and finally got one to talk. They were selling the Iksarian children to humans as play things and slaves in Qeynos. Apparently there was a huge underground network of smugglers there and they paid top copper for the exotic. I knew what I must do.

<p>I Hunted!

<p>I left the school without completing my training and traveled the wildlands, looking for proof of rumors that a boat made regular trips to this other continent where this "Qeynos" place was said to be. I found the boat and I eventually found Qeynos.

<p>That was 3 years ago.

<p>Now I roam the sewers, mingling with the riff-raff and lowlifes. The citizens are either afraid of me or fear me but that is ok. They are only unintelligent humans after all. You can't expect enlightenment from ones born so low. So I Hunt. Looking for signs of smuggling and of my sister. I have given up hope finding her, but I will be damned if these bastards will steal another child for profit!
