Gotta love Snow Days - the East Coast got slammed sunday and monday and i got to spend lots of time outside removing the ~2 feet of snow from my driveway. and to shovel a spot for my dogs to "go" since they are shetland sheep dogs and stand abit over 1 foot high...
</p>
<p>
So i Spent yesterday on Test, first leveling my Froggie, then - lo and behold a GM ... i sent a tell- pardoning the intrusion and inquired as to the possibility of them doing template chars(i was polite - ie i was sick of doing newbie crap). and got my beta char(55th monk-FEMALE though). had fun with said gm as we worked on stuff in that GM's zone. nice looking zones, interesting npc models. You are going to be HOWLING at the undead troll females once you see them in action for the first few times... its also fun to be with the zone designer and critique/make suggestions as you kill things in his zone.
</p>
<p>
With a week to go until this goes live, i'll be spending more and more time Delving into the depths of this area, i like it so far but being kos is a pain, which is why i am a monk. sneak and invis baby...hmm wonder if i can get in good with the pirates so i can save on the invisibility potion purchases.(no that is not a hint i just don't know - Yet)</p>

Ok so they are a day late and a dollar short on the info but there is a plethora of it. first, they are going to supply certain maps- Starter Cities and Newbie zones. You can read the Details about it ---<a href='http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_cartography.jsp'>HERE</a>
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, good format, But, unless they supply ALL the maps, We'll be supplying anyone that wants converted base maps by Cattj - Thanks Dude- who used existing data and converted it to the text format used by this window. At this time we have maps for every single zone in the game except for a few(the new ones for LoY and plane of time - possibly a few others). we'll find out what zones require that "special" parchment and will - as soon as that information is known - post where to get it.

As we know the Map Information for LoY is not due out until the 14th BUT, I have this little tidbit of information for you...EVERY SINGLE ZONE is ALREADY mapped(well maybe the 5 new ones for LoY are not). You know that little program Soe Hates? (SEQ)? well the format it uses for maps and EQ's format are so similar that there is already a conversion tool AND converted maps up for download, all you have to know is where to GET the files. Thanks goto Cattj for the conversion

The Team at Star Wars:Galaxies have released an UPDATED skill tree diagram for the scout, its alot more detailed and refined since they are going thru and upgrading the "fun factor" in all professions- since over testing the found it was a bit boring..... also Holocron has put out a new holobits. Still no word on Beta 3 start but they did say they are sending the code out for CD recording so i expect it to start most likely the first week of March, last week of Feb.

Those Folks over at Lucy have discovered a few new spells...Summon Lizard Spells, so it looks like with Ykesha we all- or MAYBE just Frogloks - get a new Mount to ride..though how you get a bridle on an Iksar i'll never know......
