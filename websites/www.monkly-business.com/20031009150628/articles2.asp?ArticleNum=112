          <ul>
            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              <p>This is the last Shackle Quest for us Iksar monks, and well worth the effort too. I was at level 51 when I completed the quest solo. Due to the last part of the quest, I'd suggest you be 50+ to do this quest by yourself or 45+ to do it with a group. I'm sure it can be done at lower levels, but it might be more trouble than it's worth at the moment.

<p>Anyway, onto the quest. This one starts in Timorous Deep with Master Rinmark (the "iksar master" on chessboard island). If you finish his rock collection (for the previous Shackle), he will automatically begin the quest. This brings me to the prerequisites for the quest. You will need BOTH your Shackle of Copper and your Shackle of Bronze for this quest. If you don't have them, get them. Then approach Master RInmark and ask him "who student" or "where is the student"... one of those will give you a response and a "part of a large key." It is a two slot container

<p>Ultimately, this container will need to be filled with "a copper key" and "a nickel key."

<p><b>The Nickle Key</b>

<p>The Nickel Key is easy to get, it just takes time. If you mull around the third floor of Dalnir for a while, you'll come across "a goblin penkeeper" Swat 'im! He'll drop the key you need. I've seen him in two places on the third floor. If you take the southern branch of the four way hall after you drop into the third floor, you will hit a room with three pillars. This is where I killed him. Another place he's spawned is in the "crusader room" (see <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">EQ Atlas</a> for details). After getting your Nickel Key, toss it into your "part of a large key" and head to Droga.. /em shiver.

<p><b>The Copper Key</b>

<p>Droga is not a fun place for ANYONE. I'd suggest you head down there with a few items first. Potions are the key to this portion of the quest. Before you step foot in Droga, be smart and equip yourself with two or three Invis potions (13pp give or take at the potion vendor in Cabilis) and a shrink potion (20pp give or take from your favorite Shammy). If you don't get these potions, you will probably die in Droga and you will probably have on heck of a CR ahead of yourself. There is one more element to this trip that is recommended. A porter.. druid or wizzy, it doesn't matter. It is highly preferable to be able to get out with a click of a button instead of running around aimlessly thru the halls with Ht'ing mosstroopers and backstabbing slinkers on your tail. The porter is optional, but after doing this all solo, I'd give my arm for one.

<p>You will need a map too... head to the jail area of Droga. In the Inner Sanctum (as described by <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">EQ Atlas</a>), there are two ways into the jail. One is by keys and the other is by a pit. For this run, I'd suggest you fall down into the pit. 

<b>MAKE SURE YOU ARE INVISSED BEFORE YOU FALL DOWN THE PIT.</b>

<p>Once you fall, you'll find yourself in a jail cell. If you face the door of the cell, to your right will be a secret passage (it looks like a wall, just walk through it) and on the other side, you will be in another cell with a busted down door. Also in this cell is the "goblin interrogator." He is your target. Look out for adds as you engage him... pin him to the wall and try not to let him run. There are goblins all over the place! Green to me at 51, he is a very nasty Necro-type who loves to slap DoTs and Nukes onto you. Word of warning. He has a damage shield!!! So be careful how you take him down, because his DS alone will bring you down a few bubbles if you use low delay weapons. I'd suggest you bring along your favorite 2hb and whack at him with that. You may have to FD and try him a few times before you can catch him without his DS up. Patience, Grasshopper...

<p>Once you have him waxed, loot the "Copper Key" off of him and put it in the key container. Hit the "combine" button and viola. You have the key to unlock the shackles of the Iksar slave.

<p>I saved the Droga part for last because now the rest of this quest is a cakewalk. It just so happens that the "student" that Rinmark was mumbling about is in a cell right here in Droga! Suck down a shrink potion now while you're at a safe spot and drink another invis potion. If you head out of the cell with the broken down door and turn left, you will see a cell across the jail from you. Duck and move in between the bars of that cell. In this cell, you should see some sort of Iksar. If you see "a crazed Iksar," just FD and wait for him to poof. If you see any other sort of Iksar, drop your invis, hail him, and ask him "Are you Veltar?" 

<p>If he doesn't respond with "An iksar slave's soiled face shines with a glint of hope. 'You know my name? Who has [sent] you to find me?'", do NOT hand him the key you have just combined. He isn't Veltar, and he will take your key and you will have to do it over again! If he responds as stated, then I'd suggest you finish the conversation with "Master Rinmark sent me." Let him talk some more and ask "Where is the coppernickel key?" He'll rant some more, but you're a step ahead of him. You have the coppernickel key in your hands. Now you can hand him the COMBINED key (make sure it's combined), the Shackle of Copper, and the Shackle of Bronze. He will then give you his Shackle of Steel and all you have to worry about is leaving.

<p>From this point, if you have a porter, just evac out. If not, you can re-invis, duck in between the cell bars and leave Droga normally. That part is up to you... at least you'll have your Shackle of Steel on your corpse if the goblins get you :).

<p>The Reward for this Quest is: <b>The Shackle of Steel-- Iksar Monk only... 9ac 5str 5sta 5sv magic. </b>Not a bad piece of equipment for not having to do an uber raid!

<p>NOTE: This is how I did it, as well as other monks. This method isn't guaranteed because you take shortcuts. However, I got my shackle doing just what I said. With the bugs in the game and the wonderful recognition of the NPC's, there's always the chance that it won't work. You'll just have to take that chance....
