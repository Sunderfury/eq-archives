          <p class="MB_Body">Arudane announced the ruleset for the new RP server today on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000325.html">the In Development</a> forum.<br>
For your viewing pleasure:
<ul>
<i>
<p>
Hello all,
</p>
<p>
Given that we are very close to launching the new server into live beta, I wanted to talk a bit about it and give you a &#8216;closer to final&#8217; feature list (although it&#8217;s still very subject to change).
</p>
<p>
First, just what are we going to call it? As I&#8217;d mentioned in an earlier post, we do hesitate to call it an &#8216;RP&#8217; server for two reasons:
</p>
<p>
1. We feel all of our servers are Role Playing Servers and that EverQuest is indeed a Role Playing Game.
</p>
<p>
2. We feel it&#8217;s pretty much impossible to define what Role Playing is verbally, much less via a rule set.
</p>
<p>
The idea then came up to call it the &#8216;Alignment&#8217; server, since a character&#8217;s alignment is pretty key to many of the features we&#8217;re implementing. But, to me, that still doesn&#8217;t speak to what the server is really all about. From my perspective it&#8217;s an RP server, an Alignment server, a hard-core &#8216;Seige Perilous&#8217; style server, and, quite simply, an experiment server, where we&#8217;re implementing some potential ideas for the long-term future, as well as some features we&#8217;d probably have put in the game originally, given 20/20 hindsight.
</p>
<p>
So, from here forward, I&#8217;m just going to call it by its server name, Firiona Vie (in fact, while we&#8217;re waiting on the Nameless to create more gods, we plan on naming future servers after Heroes and other prominent mortals in Norrath&#8217;s illustrious history). We don&#8217;t mind if you still call it the RP Server, or whatever else you&#8217;re so inclined, but we&#8217;re going to stick to using its &#8216;proper&#8217; name.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, before I list the features, I do want to say the following again: This feature set will undoubtedly be controversial. It will also undoubtedly NOT be consistent with many players&#8217; views as to what an RP server or any other server should be. In fact, this is (combined with having less servers overall in the past) why we&#8217;ve been hesitant to launch such a server. But we&#8217;re going forward with this anyway, and we hope it will make an interesting and even possibly better EverQuest. And we hope that some if not many players will enjoy it. 
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it sure will be a different server 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Firiona Vie Server Feature List:
</p>
<p>
 This is a new server, not a split server. Nor will there be any transfers to this server.
</p>
<p>
This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player) server. In other words, it&#8217;s a standard &#8216;blue&#8217; server with the same rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. It is not one of the &#8216;Zeks&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
Auction restricted to city zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade, Highkeep, Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas, Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Greater Faydark, Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel, Cabilis, Kael and Thurgadin.
</p>
<p>
Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than the caster.
</p>
<p>
Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as newbie notes and epic weapons.
</p>
<p>
Each character will be assigned an "alignment" upon creation. This alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen (in the same location the their Deity is described).
</p>
<p>
Each character will be able to change their alignment once any time after they reach 10th level. The player will be able to chose from a list of alignments based on their race, class and deity.
</p>
<p>
A character's alignment will determine whether or not they can group or guild with other characters.
</p>
<p>
A character's alignment will determine an experience bonus or penalty when grouping with other characters.
</p>
<p>
A character's alignment will determine if they can cast beneficial spells on other characters (including resurrections).
</p>
<p>
Language skills will improve only through group chat in the same zone and from /say.
</p>
<p>
Languages will only improve 1 point each hour and will be capped at level*5+5 skill points.
</p>
<p>
Common will not exist. A Human language will be added and only made easily available to certain races.
</p>
<p>
One character per account per server.
</p>
<p>
The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones.
</p>
<p>
Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where melee characters can bind on other servers.
</p>
<p>
/emote will be language specific
</p>
<p>
All characters will be /roleplay.
</p>
<p>
/alignment will display the alignment of your character and probably a more detailed description of that alignment.

------------------------------<p>** Spell Changes **<p>- We have removed the changes to bard song stacking that were made with the recent emergency patch.  We will be reviewing those changes for possible update in a future patch.<p>** Item Changes **<p>- The Shaman Epic effect has been returned to its previous effect (and it should conflict with fewer Damage over Time spells, as was the intention for the change made last patch).<p>** Quest Changes **<p>- Ivory Sky Diamond is now dropping as it should.<p>-  Fixed an error in a Stonebrunt quest where an NPC was handing out the wrong reward.<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Added some code that might fix a bug with female hair and Erudite hoods that caused them to fail to appear sometimes when a helmet was removed.  This would cause some characters to look as though the back of their head was missing at times.<p>- Mouselook will now work a little differently when in the first two third-person camera modes (overhead and chase).  They will work similarly to first-person mouselook (i.e. your character's heading will change when you move the mouse left or right, the left and right movement keys will cause your player to strafe, and the camera angle will pitch up or down when you move the mouse forward or back).  These changes should make those first two third-person camera modes more useful.<p>- The EverQuest Team</i></ul><p>While the servers are down, why not pop into our <a href="/chat.asp">chat room</a> or visit the <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508">message boards</a>.

Until then, they will appear on the site as external links to geocities<p>Zinj - Zinj is an equipment freak. He was well known for maintaining his 'armor upgrade path' document (see the news item below) and I have taken that passion for manipulating numbers and put it to work on the new monk equipment database.<p>Lenardo - Lenardo is an active member of the monk community, and will be working as a news reporter.<p>Yang - Yang is... well, Yang is Yang, there is no other way to describe him. He will also be working as a News reporter, and I am looking forward to some wierd and wonderful news as a result.<p>Lastly, there is me, Zadkiel. I will be keeping the site running, doing all the day to day administration and keeping the others in line.

At the moment, it may seem a little bare, but with the hard work of Zinj, and the help from you, the readers, it should soon build up to become the ultimate resource for monks.<p>Help us get the database kick-started, and go submit any items that you can think of that are currently missing.

Zadkiel has the Equipment Database loaded with a minimal amount of information under each slot.  As I haven't seen a method of mass loading; and since it is in our best interests to vet each peice for changes (since Verant is so good about stealth changes to weight, stats, etc.) this will take a LONG time to complete.
</p>
<p>
I think you'll all like what he has in the way of Search and Sort on the items.  
</p>
<p> 
As far as which peice is better than the other?  Well, you'll just have to download the information at <a href=http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=42.topic>Armor Upgrade Paths for Monks</a> topic and either use my formula; or tweak one to your own satisfaction and use it.  

</p>
<p> 
No matter what you do; if the difference between the particular stat on the two items is less than 15%; you not very likely to notice ANY difference.
</p>
<p> 
I'll be continually re-inputting information over the next few weeks; and verifying within game each night (ugh!).

Last Week, Verant Interactive did an ingame poll about the Trivial Loot Code.  In response to the poll results, Aradune - AKA Brad McQuaid, <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000320.html"> posted</a> this announcement September 20,2001 on the Everquest In Development Forums:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<i>
Hello all,
</p>
<p>
I wanted to update you all on our current thoughts regarding the Trivial Loot Code as it relates to Shadows of Luclin zones.
</p>
<p>
As per my last couple of 'Ask Brads', we've made both an effort to explain what the Trivial Loot Code does and why we were considering it for all Luclin zones. I'd also mentioned, however, that if most players appeared to be against its inclusion we'd not use it.
</p>
<p>
After talking with players, reading emails and feedback, and then very recently running a poll, it is indeed apparent that the majority of our playerbase does not feel that the Loot Code's advantages outweigh its restrictions.
</p>
<p>
In fact, after polling over 200,000 players, most want the looting system left alone, almost as many want us to explore a different solution for bottom feeding and rampant farming, and a minority were in favor of the Trivial Loot Code as it exists today in the Warrens and Stonebrunt Mountains (the remainder either didn't have an opinion or were unfamiliar with TLC).
</p>
<p>
Well, so be it 
</p>
<p>
We will head back to our drawing boards and keep brainstorming on this issue, but at this current time we do NOT intend on implementing TLC for the zones in our upcoming expansion, the Shadows of Luclin.
</p>
<p>
I do want to thank everyone for all the feedback and discussion regarding this issue -- there was a lot of debate surrounding this issue, and we've done our best to pay attention.

** Melee changes **
</p>
<p>
We're wrapping up an extensive look at the way that melee works in EverQuest. These changes are appearing now on Test (in fact, most of them are working as of right now). We wanted to make you aware of these changes in some detail so that you can give us the feedback that we need on them. Please try these changes out and comment on results that you've seen.
</p>
<p>
We will be beginning our final analysis on casters in the very near future.

<p>
* Melee Tables * 
</p>
<p>
Melee combat is based, at least in part, on tables that determines how each class functions. Up until 50th level melee and hybrid classes are on the same table, with the exception being monks who are on a separate table (one that has them doing more damage). At 50th level warriors, rogues and rangers were all moved to the monk table along with the monk, who did not receive a new separate table.
</p>
<p>
The problem here is that post 50th level the disparity between these two tables, combined with lower combat abilities for the hybrids as well as a more restricted selection of weapons acted as a double (almost triple) penalty, making them less effective in combat than was really intended.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, all melee and hybrid classes will be basing their combat off the melee table once they reach 51st level. This should increase the combat effectiveness of hybrids noticeably.
</p>
<p>
Monks, however, are intended to be somewhat better at dealing out damage in combat than warriors. To slightly improve their combat prowess they will be working from an improved combat table once they reach 55th level and again at 60th level. This will improve the combat ability of monks somewhat, essentially placing them a half a step ahead of everyone else in toe-to-toe combat in the same way that they were prior to 50th level. The rogue will still maintain a margin of superiority when you consider their ability to backstab.
</p>
<p>
* Two-Handed Weapons *
</p>
<p>
The effectiveness of these weapons falls slightly below our desire for them. This tends to make those that rely on them most often (shadowknights and paladins) also fall slightly behind our desires for their damage output, at least at levels beyond 50. We'd also like to see a broader range of weapons used by higher level warriors, and it would be nice to see two-handers as a more viable option.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we will be increasing the minimum damage of these weapons for all classes once they reach 50th level. There will be an increase in the minimum damage of two-handed weapons based on the wielder's level and delay of the weapon. The higher level the character and the larger the delay, the bigger the bonus. Obviously we're not going to give out exact numbers, but this should result in a solid increase in damage output when using two-handed weapons.
</p>
<p>
We also believe that there has been a bit of disparity between the very high-end one-handed weapons and their counterpart two-handed weapons. The ultra-high end one-handed weapons are comparatively better than their two-handed counterparts. We will, on a case by case basis, be improving many of the high-end two-handed weapons. Because this is essentially a fix for an oversight on our parts, we will be making these changes retroactive (meaning you won't have to trade the items in or hunt for new ones, existing weapons will just change).
</p>
<p>
* Rangers *
</p>
<p>
We've also noticed that rangers, while intended to be hit harder in combat than other melee/hybrid classes, are getting hit harder than we planned. Again, this only happens in the 50+ level range. So we will be increasing the defense cap for rangers again slightly to 210 at 60th level. Exactly how these points will be distributed is uncertain, but probably just one point per level after 50. We will also be giving rangers triple attack.
</p>
<p>
* Monks *
</p>
<p>
Monks will be getting triple attack. This along with the improvement of their combat tables should place them about where we want them, combat-wise.
</p>
<p>
* Bards *
</p>
<p>
Bards are indeed intended to have the least ability to deal damage physically of all the classes we're discussing. However, with their lack of double attack they didn't meet even our intentions for their damage output. We will, therefore, be raising the offense and one-handed weapon caps for bards over 50th level to match that of warriors. This should place their ability to do damage by means of melee within our intended range without making them more effective than the knights at any given level, since double attack is a potent melee skill that bards do not get.
</p>
<p>
Obviously we want to see how this all pans out when applied to the game. Feel free to send your comments on the results you see to us through the Developer's Corner on our web site, or contact our staff if you see them on the Test Server.
</p>
<p>
It is very important that you understand that these are changes that we are testing. These changes (and any others made on the Test Server) may not be moved to Live Servers. After all, that's the reason we're testing them.

** Melee Changes Update **
</p>
<p>
-The Triple Attack skill has been removed from rangers. After examining the effects of this skill during actual play, and then further discussion with both the development team and our player base, it became clear that triple attack was not a necessary upgrade to the ranger class. Rangers in their current form do damage appropriate to what we expect, and do not need additional upgrades to damage output.
</p>
<p>
We'll keep you updated on any further adjustment to these melee changes.
</p>

<p>We, the News Staff at Monkly Business, will keep everyone updated on what is happening on Test, and as soon as the changes are patched to the Live servers, we will post that information for your reading pleasure.</p></p>
