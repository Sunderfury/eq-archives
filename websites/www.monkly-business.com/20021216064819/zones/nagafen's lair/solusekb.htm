Lair</em>|Relentless&gt;</font></h1>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Overview</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nagafen's Lair is the highest
level regular dungeon in the game. Also referred to as Solusek B,
it is the home of the Kobolds, the Fire Giants, and the dragon
Lord Nagafen himself. The dungeon is divided into four basic
areas: The Kobold Area, the Bats/Bugs Area, the Efreeti Area, and
the Fire Giant Castle. Lord Nagafen can be found at the back of
the Fire Giant castle. There are named spawns in each of these
areas. The dungeon itself has monsters ranging from 33-53+, and
the recommended minimum level for coming here is about 35. Some
lower level warriors might be around to pick up a Painbringer or
Fleshripper though.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Solusek B is usually quite
crowded, especially the kobold area. In primetime, you'll most
likely have a hard time finding anything to kill. However, when
it's not crowded, it becomes alot more dangerous. All monsters
can see invisible, so corpse recovery can be a pain, plus you
can't easily get to your destination without killing everything
on the way. One runner in a crowded Sol B can spell disaster for
the party. Make sure your puller knows the layout well, as its
quite easy to get confused and take the wrong path when trying to
bring kobolds back to your party.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The standard respawn for the
dungeon is about 20 minutes.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Monsters</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Each of the four sections of
Nagafen's Lair has its own set of monsters. Depending on your
level, you'll want to pick an appropriate area to hunt. Even up
to level 50, you can hunt in the lowest level area (the Kobolds),
although many of them will be green to you. Many 50s will never
see the Fire Giant castle or the Efreeti area.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Kobolds</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are four basic types of
kobolds, excluding the named ones. They are all found in the
kobold area, which is all of the zone from the first three zones
up to the crusher. The higher level ones are found near the
crusher and the named kobolds.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Greater Kobolds - </strong>Are
        standard warrior monsters, have low ac, and don't hit too
        hard. They are good targets for the soloist. They range
        from about 33-36. Called GKs for short.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Greater Kobold
        Shamans </strong>- Shaman counterparts to the GKs, about
        the same level range. They can Tagar's Insect you, which
        slows down your attack alot, and can cast Scourge, a
        pretty long lasting disease based DoT.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Solusek Kobolds - </strong>Also
        standard warrior monsters, but they are higher level than
        the GKs. Called SKs for short, which might be confusing
        to the Sol B newbie, who might think you mean
        Shadowknight. Level range is 37-39.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Solusek Kobold
        Shamans - </strong>The shaman counterparts to the SKs.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Bats and Bugs</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The bats and bugs area is the area
after the crusher, and before the lily pads and fire giant
castle. This area is kind of funny, because now you are around
level fourty five, and find yourself fighting monsters that look
exactly like the ones you fought at level 1. Don't be fooled. The
bats bugs area is one of the highest level areas that people go
to for experience. There are three types of normal &quot;Bats and
Bugs&quot;.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Sonic Bats</strong> -
        The easiest of the bats/bugs, sonic bats range from about
        39-41. They can usually be found spawning in pairs,
        although occasionally you will find a single. Oftentimes
        they are pulled by people camping kobolds when there is
        no one blocking the pull. Nothing too notable about them
        except for their extremely annoying stun attack, which
        can stun you for almost 10 seconds. Note that bats can be
        charmed by Shamans and Druids with the charm animal
        spell.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Lava Beetles - </strong>Lava
        beetles hit very hard for their level, and also have a
        &quot;encased in fire&quot; spell effect that procs when
        they attack. They can easily do 200 damage in a round if
        you are unlucky. They range from 41-43, and are quite
        good experience. They are mostly found in the death
        beetle room, and the corridor leading to the efreeti
        area. They look like fire beetles.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Lava Duct Crawlers</strong>
        - The most dangerous of the Bugs. They are level 43-45,
        but don't hit too hard for their level. They do have a
        ton of hitpoints, and a nasty DoT (Boil Blood, 600
        damage). Called LDCs for short, they are the bane of
        kobold hunters, since alot of kobold hunting groups can't
        safely take down a LDC if it gets trained to zone.
        Generally they are found near the stone spider room. Note
        to druids/shamans. If Boil Blood has been cast on a party
        member, regen or chloroplast will cancel the effect if
        the party member doesn't already have regen or
        chloroplast. The look like heart spiders or black widows.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Efreeti Area</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also called the imp area. No one
really hunts in this area for experience. Usually the only time
you'll ever see these monsters is when pulls are really scarce,
or if you are doing a Efreeti Lord camp, in which case you have
to go through this area to get to Efreeti Lord Djarn. This area
starts from the corridor out of the death beetle room, across the
lily pad mario-esque jumping area. Two types of monsters area
found here.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Lava Guardians</strong>
        - Look like fire elementals and range from 44-46. They
        are pretty annoying, but easier to kill then the other
        choice:</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Imp Protectors - </strong>One
        of the hardest normal monsters in the dungeon, the
        Protectors range from 44-48, and usually spawn in bigger
        groups. Many a party has fallen to a group of Imp
        Protectors on the way to the Efreeti Lord.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Fire Giant Castle</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The final, and most dangerous area
of Sol B, the Fire Giant castle is the home of the fire giants
and Lord Nagafen. I've never heard of anyone hunting here for
experience. Fire Giants are very tough, and there are lots of
wanderers to make the castle a very dangerous area. Fire Giants
only respawn every 8 (?) hours or more. There are two normal
types of fire giants, and they all range from 46-53+.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Fire Giants - </strong>Extremely
        tough warriors, can summon people to attack them to
        prevent exploiting. Supposedly, if you aren't in melee
        range and try to cast on them, your spell will always be
        resisted. They hit hard and have a ton of hitpoints.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Fire Giant Magi - </strong>A
        wizard version of the regular fire giants. Very tough.</font></li>
</ul>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Map and Breakdown of Solusek's
Eye</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The best maps of Solusek B are (As
usual) Quester of Norrath's. The letters are the connection
points, and numbers are detail areas. There are four zones to
Solusek A, and one zone to Lavastorm.</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Pool Room - </strong>This
        room is called the pool room, and is one of the main
        camping areas for gorups hunting kobolds for XP. It is a
        pretty good place to hunt because you have quite alot of
        spawns to yourself, they will always be GKs, and there
        are Sol A zones nearby to escape to. It's called the pool
        room because there is a small pool of water here, the
        only water in this entire dungeon.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Window Room -</strong>
        This room is mostly a landmark, although occasionally
        people will hunt here (usually smaller groups). A good
        area to fight GKs.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Circle Room - </strong>This
        room is called the circle room, and is a good room to
        hunt when soloing. There are two spawns in the room
        below, as well as spawns nearby. The zone to lavastorm is
        really close as well.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Noble Room - </strong>This
        is where the Kobold Noble spawns, as well as two other
        kobolds. It's the first of the named monsters in Solusek
        B. The Noble is a level 38ish enchanter, and drops the </font><a

        size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). Because he's an enchanter,
        he can easily turn the tide of the battle, so be careful.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>King Room - </strong>The
        Kobold King spawns here, a 40ish Shadowknight, as well as
        two other kobolds. Be careful fighting in any of these
        three rooms, since fighting close to the edge can
        accidentally draw kobolds from the other two rooms
        (Priest and Champion). Usually the group doing the king
        also does the Priest, and sometimes the Champion too. The
        King drops </font><a

        size="2" face="Arial">Fleshripper</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). Because Fleshripper is
        nodrop, sometimes lower level players hang out here and
        wait for an unclaimed FR. Occassionally, Targin the Rock
        spawns here as well, a 39ish monk. He drops the Code of
        Zan Fi, a quest item needed for the monk Robe of the Lost
        Circle quest.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Priest Room - </strong>The
        Kobold Priest spawns in here, behind a secret door. You
        can also pull him from the king or champion room by
        casting or shooting at him. He's a 39ish cleric, and
        drops the </font><a

        nodrop, lower levels sometimes wait here to try to get
        one. Warnings from the King Room (5) apply to here as
        well.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Crusher - </strong>The
        aptly named crusher is an important landmark in Sol B.
        It's a big block that moves up and down, and seperates
        the Kobold area from the Bats/Bugs. Most bats/bugs group
        choose to fight just past the crusher in (9).</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Crusher Room - </strong>This
        room is the first of the main camping spots for Bats/Bugs
        groups, and the one best suited to pulling the Noxious
        Spider and the Death Beetle. Two sonic bats spawn in
        here.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Death Beetle Room - </strong>The
        Death Beetle spawns in here, as well as two other Lava
        Beetles. The Death Beetle is a 44ish scarab-looking
        beetle. He's probably the easiest of the named bugs. He
        drops the </font><a

        size="2" face="Arial">Death Scarab Gland</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). The beetle has a nasty
        disease based DoT which does about 900 damage over two
        minutes. Cure disease is useful against it. The scarab
        gland you get has one charge of <em>Burrowning Scarab, </em>which
        is the same DoT.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Nox Corridor</strong>
        - The Noxious Spider is a wanderer that goes up and down
        this hall. He's a level 42 spider, looks like a jungle
        spider, and has a poison based DoT. He's pretty hard for
        his level. He drops the </font><a

    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Stone Spider Room - </strong>This
        large cavern room has a ramp leading up to the Fire Giant
        Castle. Most of the spawns in this room are LDCs,
        although occasionally one of the middle ones will be the
        Stone Spider. The Stone Spider is around level 45, and is
        almost completely immune to magic. This makes catching
        him when he runs away a real pain. He looks like a Desert
        Tarantula, and drops the </font><a

        size="2" face="Arial">Brown Chittin Protector</font></a><font

        a lame item with 5 charges of Eye of Zomm. It used to be
        that the BCP was the common drop, but I believe it is now
        the rare drop. Most groups camping the Stone Spider do it
        in this room itself.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Bats Bugs Sol A Zone
        - </strong>This zone is one of the other popular places
        to pull bats and bugs to. It's got quite a few spawns in
        it (I believe a total of 4 bats), but it's got a very
        easy escape zone, you don't have to worry about other
        people's trains, and it's possible to pull the Stone
        Spider, Nox, and the Death Beetle all to this room. If
        there is no Stone Spider or crusher group, you can rack
        up alot of experience here. A wandering goblin named the
        &quot;Guano Collector&quot; <strong>very</strong> rarely
        spawns in place of the wandering bat here. The Guano
        Collector is around level 25. His common drop is the <strong>Soiled
        Bag</strong>, and his rare is the much sought after </font><a

    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Lava Beetle Corridor</strong>
        - This corridor from the Death Beetle room down to the
        lily pads is called the lava beetle corridor. About 3
        beetles spawn down its length. You should not pull from
        any farther than this room unless your group can handle
        imp protectors.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Lily Pads </strong>-
        This area has three little stepping stones in the lava to
        jump across to get to the Efreeti area. It's like Super
        Mario Everquest. Crossing the lily pads will lead you to
        the very dangerous Efreeti area, where you can find Imp
        Protectors and Lava Guardians.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Efreeti Room - </strong>The
        Efreeti Lord Djarn spawns here, about 40% of the time or
        so, on a 30 minute respawn. He is almost trivially easy
        for any group that can get to him. Getting to him is
        generally considered a two group ordeal, although it has
        been done with six good level 50 players. I've heard of
        it being done with just two Necros and two Clerics, but
        I'm positive that it's not safe to do it that way.
        Regardless, once you get there, only one group is
        required to hold the room, and I hear its a very boring
        camp. The hardest fight on the way will require you to
        take on at least three imp protectors, so be prepared.

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Suggested Hunting</u></font></h3>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">35-40 - The best place to
        hunt at these levels is the pool room, as you are
        guaranteed to be fighting all GKs. The window room and
        circle room are good alternatives. It's also possible to
        take on the noble room with ease, but the risk of charm
        along with the possible bad LDC pull make this a little
        dangerous. You can also do the King/Priest/Champ if you
        have a full group.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">40-45 - The pool room will
        still give decent experience, but it's probably better to
        hit the named kobolds. The king room can be great xp and
        loot as long as sol b isn't too crowded. If you are
        feeling daring, do the bats and bugs, but probably stay
        away from double pulls of LDCs. Bats are great xp, and
        most GKs should still be blue.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">45-50 - Some of the GKs will
        be green, so either do the King area and pull SKs and the
        occassional bat, or do bats and bugs. At the upper end,
        you'll probably find yourself doing the Efreeti Lord and
        the Fire Giants, but most likely not for experience. And
        of course, when you get a big enough group, take on the
        big boy, Nagafen himself.</font></li>
