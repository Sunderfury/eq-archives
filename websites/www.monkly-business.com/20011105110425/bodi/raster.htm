      of Guk~</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">It is high recommended to
      read a guide on Lower Guk (I used
      <A HREF="http://bcope1.www6.50megs.com/monk/guides/lowerguk.html">Jekhars</A>)
      to familiarize yourself with the area, and my Personal experience (so far)
      is added at the bottom of the page. </FONT> </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B><U>Recommendations:</U></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B></B>The following are
      items it is recommended that you have with you. The camp is extremely
      long, and you cannot always rely on help. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Damage Shield Potions:
      </B>Raster is tougher than the Mino's, and if you are able to handle a
      single Mino, but end the fight with little health, then this may possible
      turn the tide. Also, it will be just your luck to have this ultra rare
      spawn pop when you are low on health.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Minotaur Horn:</B> Found
      on the Mino's here, and on Mino's in the Gorge and Steamfont, this can be
      given to Raster to stop him duel wielding. <U>Two horns will not work.</U></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000"><B>Bandages:
      </B>A large stack of bandages (at least 100+) and a high Bind wound skill.
      The higher the skill, the less bandages will be required. Also auctioning
      for stacks of bandages at high prices helps when you are low.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000"><B>Level
      Ranges:</B> With Fists and no FBSS, it is recommended that you be approx
      47th to break the Mino room (within the respawn time) and be able to
      handle Raster. With Fists and a FBSS, probably 46th, Weapons with no FBSS,
      46th, and if equipt with Weapons and a FBSS, probably 45th. These levels
      are approximate, and when taking Raster, include the above precautions. By
      weapons, I think that a Wu's or Cane of the Tranquil are needed, and if
      armed with a Baton or two, it is probably best to wait till the next
      level. These level ranges do not include the Mino Elder, who is tougher
      (due to its ability to heal.)</FONT></P>

      Minotaurs</U></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The Minotaurs range
      approximately range from levels 35 to 39. They are warrior type mobs, have
      approx 1500 hp each, and hit for a maximum of 74. The Mino's are tougher
      than Drolvarg Snarlers from Firiona Vie in Kunark, so imagine breaking a
      room full of very hard Snarlers, and you will be on the right track.
      Rasters room is marked with a Red Star.</FONT></P>

        PH in the pit. Two of the 6 are wanderers, one near the Raster PH, and
        one near the stairs, and the last two mino's are static.<BR>
         <BR>
         Sometimes the Mino's can be vis knights instead, who are rougly the
        same toughness as Mino's, although they tend to run quicker.<BR>

         There is a additional wanderer here, who can be anything from a Froglok

    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The (frog) wanderer comes by

    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>Note:</B> Sometimes the
      wanderer is not around. I thought that he may have been killed, but at one
      6 hr camp, and at one point with only 9 ppl in LGuk, I did not see him at
      all. Which means it is possible that he paths in a different way.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Pull to the pit trap, stopping just before
      you fall down, (obviously). This gives you a fairly long time of whacking
      on their back when they run. If you fight them closer to the original
      room, they have enough time to run down the hall where a few (frog) shaman
      usually are, who will heal the fleeing Mino, or to some other Mino's in a
      side passage.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">While waiting for the despawn, you can
      either pull the Elder PH, or leave him in the pit, and rest. Once the PH
      despawns and respawns, continue clearing the room as and when the Mino's
      pop. I never bothered with the Elder PH, leaving him in the pit. This
      helped me be at better health when the other mino's popped.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The (Frog) wanderer is usually not a
      problem, and if you rest down the tunnel towards the trap, you will be
      able to see him coming and have enough time to FD before he aggros on you.
      It helps to time your pulls right after he leaves, so the mino's wont get
      unexpected help. Also 2 passes from the wanderer equals one mend.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Once the room is broken, you can stay near
      the pot (where Rasters PH is), and the (frog) wanderer does not come near
      enough to worry about, so you can clear the room from there. I found the
      corridor is safer however, as resting by the pot sometimes gave mino's a
      free hit as they spawn on top of you. </FONT></P>

         Rasters PH is a 72 min spawn/despawn, but the rest of Lower Guk is on a

        as follows. (Times are obviously EQ times.)<BR>
         <BR>
        <B>5am - Spawn. </B>Leave this one to despawn, unless it is Raster

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">When arriving at the camp, just check the

      </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">I <B>ALWAYS</B> let the PH despawn when I
      arrived to camp, unless it was just after 10am, where I would kill that,
      and let the next one despawn. This is important, as if you start to kill
      the PH straight away, the times will not match, and you could have big
      problems. One time, I could not clear the path to the PH quick enough, and
      so the PH was up for a while while I rested. I killed it, then the next
      spawn, the 5am, was very late, arriving sometime after 7am. This then
      despawned 30 seconds later! Thankfully it was a mino, but if it was
      Raster....</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The mino always despawns at the 8am even
      if it has been recently aggro'd. For instance I went to pull a mino, who
      then pathed near the PH, dragging that along with it. Feigning, both
      mino's returned to there spots/paths. The PH then despawned, as it was
      8am. Whether this works if the PH is off his spot, I cannot confirm.</FONT>
    </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">It has been noted that the PH is 85%
      likely to be a Mino, 10% to be a Froglok, and 5% to be Raster, but I am
      sure some veteran 200+ hour campers will say more like 0.5%.....</FONT>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B><U>Minotaur Elder</U></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The Minotaur Elder is approx a 35th to
      37th level Mino, but is fairly tough in that he will get off about 4 heals
      and 3 nukes before he is out of mana. If you find it tough to keep the
      Mino room cleared you can just leave the Mino (who is the Elder's PH) in
      the pit. He wont aggro unless you stand close to the edge of the pit
      (which is a good way to pull the one down there if you have difficulty
      with ladders like most people). It may be wise to experiment with how
      close to the pit you can get before the PH comes, as you will be fighting
      near here when pulling the Mino room. Do not worry too much about
      accidently pulling this PH, as I never did in my entire time there.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The Elder drops the Chrysoberyl Talisman,
      an AC5, +3 Wis, +20 Mana, Wt 1.0 necklace, which is Lore, and sells well,
      and the Elder's Rare Drop is the Carved Ivory Mask, which is AC2, +4 Agi,

    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B><U>Dec 00:</U></B> I
      went to Guk at 44th, and armed with 2 Wu's, 100hp of gear, no haste, and
      an AC of 814, and could not hold the Mino room. Some Mino's are harder
      than Snarlers, and con from xp green to blue. When I first fought the Mino
      in the Elder room, (because I fell down the pit) I took him down even with
      another beating on me at the same time. At 80 percent of hits (bind and
      mend) I could easily take SOME of the mino's, and in some cases two at
      once with those hits, but sometimes one mino on his own would hammer me
      with the same 80 percent health. <BR> <BR>It is sometimes hard to get far enough away, or remove aggro to bandage
      yourself, and in some cases I wasted many minutes waiting for mend to pop
      back again to use in case they did come back and hit me while I was
      binding myself. <BR> <BR>To recap, in the respawn time, I could not clear the room, as some are
      tougher than I with 80 percent health. My findings are not conclusive, as
      I spent only an hour there, but I got all of them apart from the Raster PH
      before they started to respawn. <BR> <BR><B><U>45th:</U> </B>Back again, same gear as above (AC now 829 though)
      and this time I am ok. I can clear the room with little trouble, although
      I leave the Elder PH still in the pit. One or two mino's still can give
      you a good beating at 80% health, which is what alot (if not all) fights
      are started at. <BR> <BR>I had the pleasure to use a FBSS for a day, (AC drops to 818) which I
      abused with a 6 hr Raster camp. This along with the above gear, helped me
      tear through most minos, one or two doing less than a bub in damage before
      dying. I still left the Elder PH alone, to have maximum hits for when the
      PH arrived, and the odd one or two Mino's where still tough.<BR>
       <BR>I have a FBSS again, on a more permant loan, which makes things alot
      easier. There are still sometimes when the room can be tough to break, and
      requires multiple attempts to sort out. <BR><BR>
       I have only fought the Mino Elder once, but that was with help, so cannot
      comment on it further, but it was blue to me at 45, and it healed itself
      around 5 times before we managed to get it to run. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B><U>Jan 01:</U></B> After
      many more mino PH, I finally got Raster on PH 83. I did not give him the
      horn, and had just over 4 bubs of (unbuffed) health. I finished the fight
      with 2 bubs left. I used a 12pt Damage sheild potion, and as noted above
      he did not hit me very often before he was running.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">As a note, I also fought the
      Elder with the same health, and he nuked the hell out of me, killing me an
      hour or so before my Raster appeared. I am not saying do this, but if you
      are in your 100+ PH, ANYTHING is worth a shot....hehehe. Good Luck!<BR>
       <BR><B>Placeholder's:</B> 83, 4 of which where Frogs, 1 (somebody elses)
      Rasters Corpse.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><U><B>May 2001:</B></U> I
      was back again at 51st level, due to my original robe being lost, but dont
      think that you can now wade into a fully packed room and kill everything
      in there. Yes, the minos are much easier (and one in 6 still gave xp) but
      everynow and then they can give you problems. The Mino Elder was easy to
      solo, when I fought him, he did nothing but chain heal himself before he
      ran out of mana and fled. I camped Raster for nearly 30 PH's, and my
      guildleader Trifle Bewildered camped nearly 20 in one sitting, and he did
      not show for me. I finally got my Raster Idol with the aid of Brother
      Axial.</FONT></P>
