          <p class="MB_Body"><p>
Alan Crosby (nice guy irl btw i have met him a few times- was the HEAD GM) is now the Community Relations guy for the EQlive team... here is Absor's post and Brenlo's Post...
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<i>
Time for a Change
</p>
<p>
I was hired as Community Relations Manager for EverQuest just over three years ago, in October of 2000.  I have to admit that the last three years have been the most entertaining three years of work I've ever had.  I've had a great time getting to know the EverQuest community.  It's been a great pleasure of meet many of you at Fan Faire, through email, and on message boards.  Your enthusiasm for EverQuest is outstanding, and I appreciate everything that enthusiasm means.
</p>
<p>
Some folks have claimed that being Community Relations Manager for a huge product like EverQuest is a thankless job, and one that they wouldn't wish on their worst enemy.  I disagree.  I still have some great emails and letters that customers have sent to us, thanking us for the fun they've had in EverQuest.  I've had one on display in my office for over a year, and I'm very proud of each of them.
</p>
<p>
I've enjoyed every minute that I've had this job.  I want to thank you all for playing the game and for engaging me every day.  I appreciate that you take us to task when we're wrong and that you appreciate the things we do well.  Thanks.
</p>
<p>
I also wanted to thank the EverQuest Live team, past and present.  I've had the honor of working with some of the best in the business.  Thanks.
</p>
<p>
But I'm only praising the EQLive team because I have to.  It's just practical to butter them up, since I'm to be one of them now.  :)  The folks here at SOE have offered me a chance to be a game designer, and I'm going to give it a try.  It's one of those undeniably exciting things, to tell people that you make games for a living.  I'm incredibly pleased to be given this opportunity.
</p>
<p>
So my official title is now Game Designer, and you'll probably be hearing a lot less from me in the future.  With my well-honed Community Management skills, I can guess your next question:  "Who will be taking your place?"
</p>
<p>
We've been lucky in that regard.  We managed to snag one of the hardest-working, most experienced and silliest people in the company.  Alan Crosby, also known as Brenlo Bixiebopper, is the new Community Relations Manager for EverQuest.  Not only is he a great guy, but he has a great name (the Alan part, not the Bixiebopper part).  Also, in the odd tradition of EQ Community Relations Managers, he also has a nice alpha-loot handle.
</p>
<p>
Enough from me.  I now yield the floor to Alan so he can introduce himself.
</p>
<p>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
Well thanks for the kind words Alan; you never say anything that nice to me in person!  
</p>
<p>
I know that Alan (the other Alan) will be greatly missed and I can never hope to fill his shoes.  He has a wry sense of humor and a comfortable writing style that many of you have enjoyed for some time now.  Thanks for all you have done Alan, and I know you will be successful adding new content to the game you have been so deeply involved with for the last 3 years.
</p>
<p>
So a little about me.  My title for nearly the last 2 years has been Customer Service Manager for our EQ games.  Prior to that I was a Lead Game Master, a Game Master and at one point long ago, a Guide and Senior Guide.  I have been playing EQ since it released, and involved with its community since shortly thereafter.  I have met many of you at Fan Faires and through correspondence, and I look forward to getting to know many more of you in the weeks and months ahead.
</p>
<p>
So change has brought me here to share time with you, the EverQuest Community.  I feel that the greatest reason EQ has been so successful for so long is because of you and your passion for this game.  I encourage you to continue to share your passion with me, in constructive ways, and I will bring your thoughts, feelings and concerns to the EQLive team.  I guarantee that you will be heard.  Please remember that we all have our own ideas of how the game should be and they may not all be implemented or even considered (I for one feel that Halflings should rule Norrath, for some reason the Dev team is not with me on this).  
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your time and thanks for being a part of Norrath!

Despite the Hype SoE has been giving the game, and frankly from playing it the ONLY reason i would consider buying it would be for the free month of eq and the beta eq2 account, LoE is getting not so good reviews.
</p>
<p>
Several Reviews of LoE are out and the news is not good for the RTS version of EQ, with most reviews giving it mediocre reviews. 
Gamespot gave it a 5.5/10, GameSpy a 2/5, GamePro a 3.5/5, Ugo a C, PC GameWorld a 73/100 and IGN a 6.5/10. the only GOOD review - so far- was from Games Domain which gave it 4/5.
</p>
<p>
Compared to it's closest "competitor" Warcraft 3, the scores are bad. Amazingly Games Domain gave WC3 when it came out the same score as LoE got, 4/5.

          Submitted by <a href="mailto:lenardo@monkly-business.com">Lenardo</a> on 12/9/2003 10:57:34 AM</p>
        <ul>
          <p class="MB_Body"><p>
Over the past Week or so alot of Posts on messageboard have been about Exp exploits and the apparent rampant "plat duping"(which wasn't a dupe actually just a way using crafting to make alot of plat relatively quickly) - well Absor has posted about the issue:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
Over the last few days there has been a growing community concern about possible cheating, exploiting and platinum duplication.  Rumors and speculation have begun to run rampant, and I've received a lot of concerned email on the topic.
</p>
<p>
First of all, I want to thank you for your concern.  The fact that you worry about this stuff as much as we do makes me feel good about the community that I work for.  I want to especially thank those that have sent in detailed information about what they thought might be dupe or exploit situations.  That information has been very helpful.
</p>
<p>
With your help, we have been able to discover and eliminate some unusual ways of cheating.  Obviously I can't go into detail about exactly how this cheating was done.  I can tell you that several of our programmers and designers took lengthy breaks from working on their current tasks to define, investigate and smash those exploits.  Most of these methods for cheating have been removed.  The few that remain will be fixed shortly.  We will be watching, and anyone using them will be banned.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, our Customer Service folks have been diligently tracking down the cheaters.  We have banned accounts and deleted characters in the hundreds.  It's never a good thing to be forced to remove so many accounts, and we're not happy that such cheating was possible.  We are pleased, however, to let you know that we are confident that we have located the majority of those that exploited the game and have removed their characters or accounts.
</p>
<p>
Obviously we won't be able to prevent all of the possible ways to cheat.  The folks that insist on trying to cheat have proven to be persistent and clever (and here is where I wonder why they don't apply that energy and skill to something beneficial...).  We need your help to locate these issues.  The multitude of eyes and ears of our players is always the best source of information for us.  If you ever suspect that you have discovered something that seems like an exploit, please send that information to us through the Developer's Corner AND through /bug.  Please don't assume we have heard the information already.  We'd rather have ten reports about something like this than none.
</p>
<p>
I'd also like to address a rumor about the nature of some of the cheating that people have been talking about.  There has been speculation in the community that in order to pull off some of the rumored exploits someone had to be working on the "inside".
</p>
<p>
We take such possibilities very seriously.  And we have investigated this very thoroughly.  We keep track of all special EverQuest commands issued.  We have looked into the possibility that someone working here had a hand in helping others cheat, and we have discovered no evidence that indicates that to be the case.  Also, the nature of the cheat did not require such inside help.  I can't describe the cheat method in any detail, but there was an experience cheat that allowed extremely fast leveling.  This required some rather sophisticated cheating, but was being done without inside help.  Obviously we have removed that exploit and banned any accounts that used it.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for playing EverQuest.  And thank you for you help making the game fun.
</p>
<p>
Have a great holiday season.
</p>

Alan
