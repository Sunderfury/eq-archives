BARF.. 
</p>
<p>
Seriously though, this game looks fun but unfortunately I get motion sickness and FPS type games tend to make me ill. Spiritual, Baelish & I walked in on the tail end of the planetside demo (we were on break from eqlive forum 1- and wanted to hit the eq2 forum) where 2 of the dev's were playing and the third was answering questions. The forum went over by ~20 minutes.
</p>
<p>
I was impressed with the clean graphics, the fast game play, the smooth animations of the pc's it was all very impressive and it looked like it is going to be a lot of fun to play, especially if you are into Co-operative team play fps games.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately due to motion sickness susceptibility I doubt that I will be trying the game beyond any beta testing I might do. They are about to go into open beta and put the stress test on, but they are looking for each  server to have 3-5 thousand people playing at a time.

This is the First of many news articles in the next few days about things i learned at the Fan Faire.
</p>
<p>
According to the dev's -Paul answered this one - at the eqlive forum, the Plane of Time IS finished and was ready when pop was released. 
</p>
<p>
However, the Rathe encounter in poeb is being reviewed by the eqlive team at this time. Apparently the encounter is a bit too tough. For those that do not know, as i understand it(i've not been there so i don't know exactly the details beyond this: there are 12 spawn, all 12 have to be dead at the same time ie before respawn. respawn is 6 minutes.

From Q-3p0's Weekly Beta Report....
</p>
<p>
<i>
<ul>
Today we are sending Beta 3 CDs to our existing Beta 2 members. Next week we will make the switch over to Beta 3 with them. Assuming all goes well, we'll start sending out the invites soon thereafter. As stated, we're going to ramp up the numbers, starting with 5000. Again, if all goes well, we'll get the numbers up to 50,000 within a month or so. The NDA will remain for the time being.
</ul>
</i>
<p>
<p>
Good Luck everyone who applied to be a beta tester. Hope you get in.

Most people did not get Shadowbane yesterday(release day), i have reports of PRIMETIME max on OPENING DAY being Minimal, with some servers not breaking 50. the main reason is most retailers(i checked a few all said wednesday) will not be receiving the game until TODAY. thus the true start of the game will be today and tomorrow, it remains to be seen if it will be a "DAoC" style release or an AO style release, but if the end of beta was any hint, i'd be leaning more towards DAoC. still doesn't mean the game will do well overall. oh btw speaking of DAoC, i have heard they recently broke 200 thousand active accounts which i believe puts them over UO but still less than half of EQ(and like a 8th of lineage which is mostly korean).

Now i am not a FPS type of person really but this <a href='http://planetside.station.sony.com/media/PlanetSideTrailer.wmv'> Movie Trailer</a> on Planetside Really wowed me. i definately will be giving this game a look see, it LOOKS fun. It looks like SoE might have another Huge hit on their hands when this comes out. i Gotta remember to apply to the beta at home(i keep forgetting), they required a diagdx log...
