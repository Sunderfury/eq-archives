              While most of the monks who read the guides section are too high level to find this information useful, I hope that it will be a convenient place for you to point to when newer players ask for help with their income.  Please make a post if you have any ideas you wish to add, keeping in mind this is meant for newbies.<br>
<br>
The guide is divided into a section for humans and a section for iksar, as their sources of income vary somewhat.<br>
<br>
<b>General Advice</b><br>
<br>
I'm sure you've heard by now that you need to stay under 15 weight or you will lose AC.  This is true.  However, as a newbie, the hit is so small that you will hardly notice.  Loot everything, you'll need the money later.  The AC hit will become more noticeable as you level up, and by level 20 you will want to stay under the weight limit.<br>
<br>
<b>Humans</b><br>
<br>
Buy food and water for evils.<br>
Sell stacks of snake eggs to bakers.<br>
Sell stacks of batwings to players. 2-5pp a stack<br>
Sell stacks of bonechips to players. 3-5pp a stack<br>
Sell stacks of spiderling silk to tailors/smiths.<br>
Sell stacks of spider silk to tailors. 10-20pp a stack at least, or trade for cured silk/Wu's fighting  armor.<br>
If you see a mob with a stick, kill it.  It might be a cracked staff, and vendors pay more than a plat each for them.<br>
Sell pelts to tailors. Low and medium quality for 1-2pp a pelt. High quality cat and wolf for 2-3pp a pelt. High quality bear for 30pp a pelt.<br>
<br>
Keep the ruined cat/wolf/bear pelts for your own use.  Some vendors sell tailoring patterns for armor for around 5 silver.  Combining a ruined pelt and any tailoring armor pattern in a loom/sewing kit has a chance of increasing your skill in tailoring, and producing a piece of patchwork leather armor.  The armor is kind of heavy for a monk, but that's ok, since you can sell it to a vendor for more than a gold.<br>
<br>
Hunt wisps in WC/Erud's Crossing when you get old enough and get some magic gloves (netted being cheapest). This is the big cash cow for both Qeynos and Freeport monks. You need magic in order to hit them (netted/woven/mesh/Wu's gloves and round kick/tiger claw).  They sometimes drop greater lightstones, which is the big moneymaker. There are some quests you can do that give you books in exchange for the greater lightstones, and the books sell to vendors for 8-10pp. You can either do the quest in North Karana at the gypsy camp, or in South Ro at the dark elf camp. To do the quest with the dark elves you will need the sneak skill you got at level 8.  If you don't want to make the trip, you can sell the stones to players for 5-8pp.<br>
<br>
You could also hunt bears in search of HQ pelts during the levels you would hunt wisps. Rabid grizzlies in QH or young kodiaks in WC/Misty would work at these levels, although you'll want to partner/group to do them at first. Druids make good partners for this as they can both snare the bears and fear them so they don't hit you. Plus if you do get hit they can heal you.<br>
<br>
If a Qeynos monk, I would move to the Warrens next (see Steven's post below), or to the Karanas to hunt bandits. Bandits drop bronze (I think) and there is a quest for their bandit sashes in Qeynos that rewards coin and bronze weapons IIRC.  If a FP monk, move to orcs in EC/WC next and sell their belts to players for 3-5pp each. Then kill dervs for bronze weapons and rawhide leather, good vendor food.  They also drop some 1 ac  2 dex rings which are worth wearing until you can buy something better.<br>
<br>
After they stop giving good exp, I'd move to either High Pass or Ocean of Tears. High pass has orcs and gnolls to group against with nice drops, and they drop scalps you can turn in for exp/faction or sell to players who want to do the quests themselves. I don't know what good prices are for the scalps, but if you spend some time listening to others auction them, you'll get a good idea. Ocean of Tears has an island with gargs on it, and their eyes sell for 8-10pp each and stack, perfect for monks. You'll want at least a partner to go with you in your low 20s, if not more. In your mid 20s you can solo here as well. Just stay away from the center of the island, and the specs will not bother you. They won't assist the gargs, so if a garg runs to the center, just wait for it to come back.<br>
<br>
If you are an agnostic monk (Qeynos), hunting in the Overthere of Kunark is a good alternative from 18 to 24 or so. There are lots of blues and many of the drops sell well to vendors. There are even guards to run to if you are in trouble.<br>
<br>
The mid 20 are also good levels to hunt mammoths in Everfrost with a group. Their tusks may weigh 10 stone each, but they sell again for 8-10pp each. <br>
<br>
<b>Iksar</b><br>
<br>
Making money on Kunark is a bit different from the old world, mainly due to the lack of bats, willowisps and bears.  On the up side, almost every mob on Kunark drops cash, even bugs and animals.<br>
<br>
Buy food and water for non-iksar. <br>
Sell stacks of spiderling silk to tailors/smiths.<br>
Sell stacks of spider silk to tailors. 10-20pp a stack at least, or trade for cured silk/Wu's fighting  armor.<br>
Sell pelts to tailors. Low and medium quality cat for 1-2pp a pelt. High quality cat for 2-3pp a pelt.<br>
If you see a mob with a shield, kill it.  It will be an iksar targ shield, and vendors pay more than a plat each for them.<br>
If you see a mob with a stick, kill it.  It might be a cracked staff, and vendors pay more than a plat each for them.<br>
Sell scorpion pincers to vendors.  There is a newbie quest for them, but you get a lot more money from the vendors than from the quest.  While the quest does give you exp when you are really young, keep in mind that exp is easy to get as a newbie, cash is not.<br>
<br>
Sell stacks of bone chips to players.  This is your biggest source of income as an iksar.  Bone chips are worth a lot more on Kunark than the old world, as there is a quest for faction with the iksar in the Field of Bone that uses bone chips.  High level players will often come through the Field of Bone /auctioning to buy stacks of bone chips for 5-10pp a stack, sometimes more.  Never sell for less than 5pp a stack.  If the person there won't pay that much, just wait, because someone will.  Also, while FoB is the place to sell bone chips, undead is a bit harder to find in that zone.  At lower levels the Lake of Ill Omen is the place to go for bone chips, and from your teens and up Kurn's Tower is the place to be.<br>
<br>
Iksar monks are very fortunate to have easy to obtain and fairly nice newbie armor quests.  The Haggle Baron next to the Court of Pain has a quest that gives you a piece of random curscale armor.  Keep doing this quest until you get a full suit (minus the bracers).  This way you won't spend any money on inferior cloth armor, and each time you do the quest you usually get more than a gold in cash.  Also, the quest giver gives you a free 8 slot pack for gathering the quest items in, so you won't have to buy one at first.  This quest doesn't reward wrist armor, which is fine as your guildmasters have a series of quests that reward shackles for your wrists.<br>
<br>
When you get high enough to kill iksar bandits, collect 3 bandit masks.  You'll need two for your 3rd shackle, and the third mask is to wear on your face.  It is better than cured silk for the same slot.<br>
<br>
Spend your first few gold on a Survival Staff from a vendor in the Field of Bone so you can practice 1 handed blunt while you are young.  Then buy a shovel from the vendors in Cabilis near the loom so you can work on 2 handed blunt.<br>
<br>
Every cat on Kunark higher than a kitten can drop cat pelts.  You can sell the quality pelts as mentioned above, and keep the ruined pelts for your own use.  Some vendors in Cabilis sell tailoring patterns for armor for around 5 silver.  Combining a ruined cat pelt and any tailoring armor pattern in a loom/sewing kit has a chance of increasing your skill in tailoring, and producing a piece of patchwork leather armor.  The armor is kind of heavy for a monk, but that's ok, since you can sell it to a vendor for more than a gold.<br>
<br>
Sometime after you reach level 18, you will want to consider going to the Northeastern part of the Overthere to hunt.  It is a good alternative from level 18 to 24 or so. There are lots of blues and many of the drops sell well to vendors.  Just don't stray too close to the outpost, as you are KOS there.<br>
<br>
<b>Buying and Selling</b><br>
<br>
Steven mentioned that it would be wise to invest in a Crude Stein (+15 cha) to boost your charisma and get better prices at vendors. Some other cheap +cha gear you can get are some Opalline Earrings (+5 cha each), Electrum Cat's Eye bracelets (+4 cha each) or Golden Cat Eye bracelets (+7 cha each), and a Split Paw Tooth Necklace (+5 cha).<br>
<br>
When buying items from players, I've noticed that some days are sale heavy and some are purchase heavy. If you see lots of people looking to buy an item repeatedly, expect to pay a lot to get one. If you see lots of people selling them without being snatched up, then you can probably get a bargain.<br>
<br>
First investments that I would make:<br>
(If human) Magic gloves. Netted (1pp), Woven (2-3pp), Mesh (4-5pp), Pit Fighter Handwraps (10pp?), Split Paw Hide Gloves (20pp?), Wu's (45-55pp), Gem Inlayed Gauntlets (a few hundred plat).  Iksar don't need them much as Kunark is pretty much free of magic only mobs in my experience.<br>
<br>
(If iksar) A Survival Staff and a Shovel.  If human vendors had them I'd recommend humans get them too, but such is life.<br>
<br>
A suit of cured silk or Wu's armor.<br>
<br>
A Sarnak Enforcer for a 1hb weapon.  7/28 magic 1.5 weight  ~50pp<br>
<br>
A Lockjaw Tunic for your chest.  12 ac  5 stamina.  25-35pp<br>
<br>
Bamboo Bo Staff for 2hb.  8/20 magic 1.0 weight ~50pp<br>
<br>
Jagged Bands for your fingers.  5 ac  3 strength each.  25-50pp each.<br>
<br>
Orc Fang Earrings for your ears.  3 ac  3 strength  15 hit points each.  ~50pp each.<br>
<br>
Fighting Baton as an upgrade for 1hb.  8/20 magic 2.0 weight.  300-600pp.<br>
<br>
