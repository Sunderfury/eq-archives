      Fist is the upgrade to the <A HREF="robequest.htm">Robe of the Lost
        Circle</A>, so obviously that quest needs to be completed first.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">You need to speak to
      'Brother Balatin', who is a skeletal Monk on the pyramid in the giant
      wizard spires within the Dreadlands in Kunark. The giant spires are
      located at the far end of the zone, where the Druid rings are. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">He has a Plaguebone
      Skeleton as a PH, and the respawn is approximatly 6 minutes. Brother
      Balatin despawns after approximatly 30 mins.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">He is KOS to all, and
      needs an enchanter or Necro to charm him, otherwise he will attack you. He
      will still be scowling, but will talk to you and accept the items
      required.</FONT></P>

          be a Bard, as the Bards Charm is pulse based, and breaks and recharms
          every 9 secs or so. Balatin breaks charm quicker than a normal NPC
          would (and you have a lot to lose,)so it is best to be on the safe
          side.</FONT></P>

      </B>The quest is possible to be done via 'multi questing', ie it will work
      if you use two other people to turn the pipes (or robe) in. You will be
      able to multiquest this quest until Verant decides to change the whole
      quest system in some way (and the usual multiquesting warnings apply.)</FONT></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">Firstly,
      charm Brother Balatin, hail him, and go through all the text (or not
      --depending on your mood), then have helper A turn in (as in complete the
      trade by clicking the trade button) their pipe, and wait to get the &quot;May
      you have the correct items or lost forever will be all&quot; message. Then
      have helper B turn in the other pipe, again wait to get the &quot;May you
      have the correct items or lost forever will be all&quot; message. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">Then turn in
      your robe. Please make sure you hand in the correct items, there is not a
      really short time limit before the trade needs to be completed. One
      brother I know accidently handed in his TStaff, (luckily before the robe
      was handed in) but got it back by killing Balatin. Also, it is reported to
      still be ok if the charm breaks while you are handing in items. Just
      recharm him and continue as if nothing happened. The person that this
      happened to still got their robe. </FONT></P>

        two others, and lost my robe as the first person mistakenly gave in a
        weapon instead of the pipe. Please DOUBLE CHECK the items you hand in,
        or just take that extra second to notice whether Balatin is now weilding
        a weapon that he previously did not have. I did not, and lost my
