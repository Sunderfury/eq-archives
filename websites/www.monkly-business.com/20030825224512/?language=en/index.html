Despite Getting Invited to this event, I Never heard back from EA after Registering for the Event thus was unable to go to the unveiling(well fatal woulda gone in my place since i was moving)

<ul>
AUSTIN, Texas, August 22, 2003 - Origin Systems, an Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: ERTS) development studio, today announced the development of Ultima X: OdysseyT (UXO), a next generation massively multi-player online role-playing game (MMORPG) from the award-winning Origin studio team. Powered by the latest version of the Unreal® Engine and based on the renowned UltimaT single-player role-playing series, UXO will enable players to create personalized legacies in a massive new online world and will be one of the first of its kind to offer private areas on demand within the game. 
</p>
<p>
"Ultima X: Odyssey takes the genre to the next level through its innovative new Odyssey Adventure System ensuring that players experience a greater sense of adventure and reward from both questing and combat," said Andy Hollis, vice president and chief operating officer of Origin Systems. 
</p>
<p>
UXO's proprietary and innovative Odyssey Adventure System delivers customized quests to players automatically and enables private adventure zones, providing adventures on demand as players journey through the world. An added bonus in offering players private areas is that they can't be interrupted by "griefers" and other uninvited guests. 
</p>
<p>
Strategic combat is another key differentiator for UXO that engages players in a fast-paced, real-time exchange of attacks and easy-to-use special moves. Players can choose their level of aggressiveness and a variety of combat styles, making the outcome of the battle as dependent on players' actions as on their characters' strength. In addition to individual combat, player guilds can challenge other guilds to gladiator-style dueling in privately created zones. 
</p>
<p>
UXO offers a higher level of challenge, adventure and character customization through the Virtues, a popular component of the award-winning Ultima series. In UXO, players can ascend their characters to become the Avatar once they have mastered all eight Virtues. Mastery of a Virtue allows a player to unlock special powers and, eventually, create disciple characters. Players can build a pantheon of heroic followers, all of whom can aid one main character in pursuit of attaining the status of Avatar.
</p>
<p>
In addition to character customization, UXO provides an exciting level of customization through its item and virtue systems, allowing players to customize themselves, their inventory, their party or their guild in ways never before possible. For instance, players can enhance weapons and armor using either Virtue abilities or player experience points. Furthermore some magic items and weapons can level with players, gaining experience or Virtue as their character does. 
</ul>

Interesting 3 question interview tidbit. I like the last one the best...here is the answer
</p>
<p>
<i>
<ul>
Our game definitely doesn't fall victim to the "hit auto-attack and nap" syndrome. Just as casters must make decisions about their most effective combat strategies, melee types will have resources and skills to manage. <b>Melee will get special attacks called "arts," which they will have to memorize and unlearn just like spells. There will also be strategies involved in selecting them; a certain art that a warrior-type has might increase the effectiveness of a roguish player's attack, for example, so these players will want to plan their arts to achieve the greatest effectiveness possible in each encounter.</b>
</p>
<p>
Also, the very nature of combat has evolved in EQ2. Rather than pitting a group of players against a single NPC, mobs will often work together and will need to be handled as a group. Traditional methods of crowd control that EQ players are familiar with may have to be reevaluated in the Norrath of the future.
</ul>
</i>
</p>
<p>
Interesting.....

I have not covered SWG much in the past month due to the complex changing of what is happening in game. they are currently at ~150k accounts and going ok so far.
<p>
<p>
Raph Koster has an interview - <a href='http://www.ugo.com/channels/games/features/starwars_galaxies/raphkoster.asp'>HERE</a> on UGO. few interesting TIDBITS.
</p>
<p>
1. mounts are being tested Internally - mounts first, then single person vehicles, then multi person-yes combat will work inside them too.
</p>
<p>
2. sabbac & other forms of gambling ARE coming - slot machines and roulette first.
</p>
<p>
3. one of the biggest gripe some people had was the lack of mob dropped loot, well guess what- they put some in for release, they are putting even MORE in soon.
</p>
<p>
4. several players got the game message that they unlocked their force sensitive slot- but that was a bug and they didn't actually do that(of course if that happened to me i'd be complaining LOUDLY about not getting it). 
</p>
<p>
5. the specs for player cities are on the boards for player input- so expect that soon as well.
</p>
