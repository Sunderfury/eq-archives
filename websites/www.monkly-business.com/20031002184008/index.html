Apparently on Test Center players have force powers to play with now, which begs the questions. were the force powers in the game already and they did this to get more people to play on test ORRRR were they not in the game and they are implementing them now? you know what the Dev's will say, the former... it also could be that they are losing alot of subscriptions and they are doing something to try to retain them longer and being able to play with force powers would keep me around for another month or two easily - if i played swg that is..
</p>
<p>
Also Swg has said that Mounts are almost finished and they released a movie demonstrating a Dewback Mount, and frankly they look Really Well done. once mounts are done, can vehicles be far behind?

You heard me right, they are going to be implementing - I heard around xmas but I bet it won't be til next expansion- a NEW graphics engine for everquest, new char models the whole 9 yards....and supposedly they are going to actually optimize the models to be less memory intensive- I heard they are going to be less memory intensive than the old models from Original Eq are...all I can say is- ITS ABOUT TIME!!!

Thank Vhoghul for those files-if anyone else has the WHOLE thing send em to me so i can listen to the overall tone of the forums-which i heard was fairly angry. Now as to the Details of said files:
</p>
<p>
Warriors & aggro generation/Taunt:
</p>
<p>
The eq team is almost ashamed that the issue has not been resolved and addressed, but it will be DEFINATELY addressed when the melee imbalance fix is implemented.
</p>
<p>
Melee imbalance
</p>
<p>
 Again the EQ team apologized for letting the issue take so long BUT they said they have a team working on it now and it will be addressed soon. They are looking at revamping disciplines etc like the "future plans" says. whether or not it is enough waits for the changes to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
Itemization
</p>
<p>
Current itemization in eq benefits the hybrid more than the pure classes. they will look into it and might change the way they do itemization to make pure melee items.. IMO they should.
</p>
<p>
The Line of Sight code for EQ is being completely Rebuilt as I type this.
</p>
<p>
"Pure" Instancing (LDoN style) for the Plane of Time
</p>
<p>
Currently is not being looked into, that MIGHT change in the future.
</p>
<p>
BARDS - Fading Memories might be changed, to what exactly, they are not sure, According to the panel(S.H. said it) the team that designed the AA skill did not anticipate the tool it would develop into.
</p>
<p>
According to Kinma at the fan faire it was Revealed that they can set FD success rates according to a ZONE, so you actually CAN fail more in XX zone than YY zone, and it is INTENTIONAL.
</p>
<p>
As i get more Info i'll post it.

I liked that game, just not enough to buy it at release. it is a year older and a year better, if you are bored with the SoSDD why not give this game a shot, you can DL and play it for free for a week i believe.

SoE has announced the cast of voice actors for Lords of EverQuest:
</p>
<p>
Fairuza Balk, John Rhys-Davies, Hudson Leick, Kate Mulgrew, Ron Perlman, Katey Sagal, Michael T. Weiss, and Dwight Schultz. Gamespot gives Dwight Schultz A-Team Credits but i believe he is more famous for his Star Trek Character - Barclay (The Next Generation, Voyager and I think he was on DS9)

I Know, "But Len you Never cover DAoC..."<br>
From Gamespot:
</p>
<p>
Servers opened today for beta-testing the latest expansion pack for Mythic Entertainment's massively multiplayer online role-playing game Dark Age of Camelot: Trials of Atlantis. 
</p>
<p>
This begins Mythic's third phase of beta, a large-scale beta-testing, for the game. The Atlantis expansion introduces a number of graphical upgrades to the almost-2-year-old Dark Age game while also allowing access to a new half-submerged continent and a series of epic trials designed to test higher-level characters.

As I find out what is happening at the fan faire i'll let everyone know what's Happening. few things i hope are covered, the current status of melee imbalance vs casters and hybrids, the fact that treasure chests suck, and several other topics related to the general health of the game and balance. Unfortunately due to me being broke and the wife taking the same week off i had to cancel my fan faire visit (lucky Devs) but i hope that those that do attend have fun
