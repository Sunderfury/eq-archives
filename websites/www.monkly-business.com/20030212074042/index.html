Soe decided to draw their testers for the extension of Everquest - Legacy of ykesha from the wonderful
community on Test. Folks on Test know quite a bit about finding
and describing bugs and they are aware of many of the issues that can come
up with new features and content.  they couldn't ask for a better source for
beta testers. 
</p>
<p>
In my opinion that is what test is for, they shoulda been testing ALL the new content for all expansions. Live Server players got picked as well, because they were lucky enough to have logged onto test and get an email for the beta. as to how i know all this, a little birdy told me.

<p>
- Fixed a bug that was causing top level windows and merchant slots to be drawn off the screen, causing them to appear to be steadily moving to the left, eventually disappearing entirely.
</p>
<p>
If the interface continues to give you troubles after this update, please type /LOADSKIN and choose "Default" to reset your UI settings.

interesting concept, whether or not it'll be a rousing success remains to be seen, or for those like me who ABSOLUTELY HATE DOING TRADESKILLS, could be essentially useless-unless they are not nodrop and are tradeable.

In preparation for LoY, the Froglok population of Norrath has invaded Grobb, driving the trolls out of Grobb into the wilderness searching for a new home - Neriak is where i believe they will end up. supposedly there were a few GM events around doing this but heh i was not on last nite due to having to get ally to my wife faction- my son's faction in the middle of the night is KoS though - little guy woke at 3am.

gotta love PATCH DAYS
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<i>
** Interface **
</p>
<p>
- All settings for the Songs window should now be saved properly when the player logs out.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug that could cause the Bit Depth and Refresh Rate setting to not save properly upon exit.
</p>
<p>
- Users of Windows XP should no longer be seeing their Windows mouse cursor or other windows 'bleed through' into the game.
</p>
<p>
** Gameplay **
</p>
<p>
- Changing from an old model character to a Luclin model character at character select should no longer result in the character having no hair.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug that caused merchants to charge a little extra or less (1 copper).
</p>
<p>
- Merchants will no longer claim that they will pay 1 copper for starting equipment (they have never actually purchased such items).
</p>
<p>
** Spells **
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a problem with the Giantsbane Spell quest NPCs not spawning in Skyshrine.
</p>
<p>
- Failing to hide while invisible will now make the invisibility icon disappear.
</p>
<p>
** Trade Skills **
</p>
<p>
- Many Planar Recipes can now be used in collapsible containers. Some Planar Tailoring can only be done in the Tanaan Loom as opposed to the Planar Sewing Kit.  Nothing that was previously made in the Loom was added to the collapsible tailoring kit.  Skills changed were Baking, Sewing, Jewel Craft, and Fletching.
</p>
<p>
- Added gnome cultural recipe book to Ak'Anon.
</p>
<p>
- Changed the weights on Spiritstones to be more in line with Faithstones.
</p>
<p>
- Changed Collapsible Jeweler's Kit to 6 slots from 4.
</p>
<p>
** Zones **
</p>
<p>
- Grummus is much more likely to stay in his home.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed the door to the Ak'Anon zoo, by request of the Zookeeper's Union #23.
</p>
<p>
- Newly created Wood Elf Druids will now make their first appearance in the world much closer to their guild master.
</p>
<p>
- Fennin Ro is now more durable, more in line with the other elemental plane gods.
</p>
<p>
-Rallos Zek now moves considerably faster then before, as do his cohorts. He will also become very, VERY angry should he be removed from his lair(s).  
</p>
<p>
- Skyshrine will once again require a key for exit into the Cobalt Scar.  The fact that the key was not needed was a bug.  We do understand that few people actually walk through this area considering the other methods of transport available, but the dragons aren't leaving their doors open.
</p>
<p>
** Items **
</p>
<p>
- Corrected the inventory icon for the Acrylia Studded Legs and the Two-Handed Practice Sword.
</ul>
</i>
</p>
<p>
Over all an interesting little patch. I KNEW the skyshrine zone to cobalt scar key requirement was a bug-since the requirement vanished on the revamp of skyshrine. One little bit of worry i have, just like the patch jan 28 or 29th i am getting reports of different .xml file downloads, i got the bigbank, others got inventory, even others got the char select. Those .xml files are not supposed to be "live" until the 24th. so this is a bit of a warning, if you crash alot, its probably SoE's fault.
