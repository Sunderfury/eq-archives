    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Meeting at Lavastorm, the
      long wait begun for my first Dragon run, and the assembly of the Dragon
      Hunter Troops of Bristlebane. Once all had arrived, the planning begun,
      with names being called, and groups assigned. Iinan, hunt leader, had
      placed me in group 2, where I was accompanied by Borgin (Cleric), Ruzam
      (Paladin), Tenzris (Monk and puller for the raid) Kadunka (Warrior),
      Serendith (Shaman) and myself, a fresh lamb to the slaughter of Lord
      Nagafen. Asking many questions, I tried to recall all of the information I
      had been told before by my elders, and was confident that my first run
      would be a success.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT>With
      the rest of the groups called out, the ground rules of todays hunt where
      laid down, which covered rules for the allocation of treasure that was
      rumored to be within Lord Nagafens lair. <B>(/ooc See end for rule
      summary)</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">With groups buffed, we
      sounded off, then entered the dungeon known as Sol B, having arranged to
      meet in the Stone Spider room deep within. Clearing the path to this room
      is no problem at all for the troops present, and Kobolds and even the
      yellow spider dropped quickly.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT>Soon
      we are all crowded in a small corridor, past the ledge from the Stone
      Spider room, awaiting further instructions. The scout confirms that nearly
      all the Fire Giants are dead, but a few remain near to Nagefen himself, so
      we move upto the first room. While more buffing goes on, a lone Giant is
      spotted, and he is assaulted by all present, and soon the giant falls
      under the many blows and spells.</FONT> </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/naggy_fg.jpg" WIDTH="528" HEIGHT="433"></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Moving up slowly, a section
      at a time, we encounter a few Lava Duct Crawlers, but again these are
      brushed aside by the masses assembled. It is confirmed that Magus Rokyl,
      the named Fire Giant Wizard is up, and so a lotto is made on the
      assumption of him wearing his mask. We then slowly move upto the throne
      room, then over the bridge to Dragons Head room. There are two more Fire
      giants left, and these are both brought into the room to be killed. One of
      the hunters, Wychwood, manages to get himself summoned no less than 3
      times during the fight with the two Giants, but puts the finishing blow to
      one of them for their rudeness. One of the Giants manages to get slightly
      stuck, as shown below....</FONT> </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><IMG SRC="images/naggy_stuckfg.jpg" WIDTH="528" HEIGHT="291"></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">More buffs and healing
      follows, and then Tenzris goes to pull Rokyl, taking a swipe from Nagafen
      as well on his way back. With Rokyl chasing him back to the trap laid for
      him, Rokyl dies in the assault, but not before summoning Wychwood again
      for good measure. Magus Rokyl had his mask upon him, so it was removed
      from the corpse to someone who would get better use out of it.</FONT> </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">With the Giant castle now
      clear, and Lord Nagafen the last remaining foe, the last buffs where
      applied. Starting with 4 useless buffs (for the situation at hand), we
      moved onto the serious ones, applying AC/HP/Resists/Haste and body
      enhancing ones such as improved Strength and feeling more Dexterous,
      before waiting until all are ready.<B> (/ooc After Buffs, we logged in
      Chat, then waited for the signal to log back in again.)</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Soon the time comes. Raid
      leader Iinan calls out the instructions, &quot;<B>Remember to go on your
      wave: 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6 with a short count between them.</B>&quot;
      We are also told to retreat back to this room (where we are currently
      arranged,) when we are feeling 'poorly' to be healed before returning to
      combat. Confirming that we are group 2, and the in the first wave, I grip
      my sticks tightly, and as the last group sounds off, the countdown
      initiated by Taneran begins.. </FONT></P>

      </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Second up the ramp after
      Iinan, I rush up the stairs and round the corner, running up a ramp
      towards the Dragon, Lord Nagafen himself.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The sight of him moving his
      massive frame to confront the intruders to his lair was awe inspiring, but
      my first view of the scene was cut short as Nagafens first defensive move
      was to Dragon fear the interlopers.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">As the rest of the tanks rush
      in, I am running out again, past the gathering of Clerics and Mages, and
      to the end of the hall past where we set up base camp. Gaining composure,
      I rush back again, only to have the same thing happen again. Third time
      works better, as by this time Nagafen is being distracted somewhat by
      others smashing him with sticks, slashing him with swords and blasting him
      with spells.</FONT></P>

       </P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Burning from repeated breath
      attacks, I move under his belly and start my assault whacking him with my
      sticks. Remembering the call that I am supposed to come back to camp when
      low on health, I first use mend to stay in the fight. Bad move, as Nagafen
      starts to wonder what the itch is around by his genitialla, and starts to
      investigate. Nagafen misses me twice to start with, narrowly missing his
      own nadges with his large claws, and then decides he has had quite enough 
      with me, as the first glancing blow stuns me, I am then feared, and while
      feared and stunned, he tears my head off from its shoulders. This results
      in one dead Monk.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>(/ooc In one minute and 3
      seconds, I parsed 1429 damage to Nagafen, or just under 23 dps, however
      Lord Nagafen did just over 800 damage in 10 seconds.)</B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Appearing in Freeport, I wait
      patiently until my body is discovered under Nagafens corpse, and I am
      dragged back to be revived. I was also told that our group got the
      experience for Nagafen as well, but because I was in Freeport, did not
      receive it. Once everyone is back in the Lair, the Dragon horde is
      announced as follows:</FONT></P>
