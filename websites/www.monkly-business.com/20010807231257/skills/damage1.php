<ul><FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Note: This Guide is focused towards Monks. The information herein is based in it's entirety on the Monk Class. Some of the information may very well be the same for other Classes but not all of it is. If you are a Warrior do not expect the Hand To Hand Skill stats listed to be the same for you as they are for Monks. Likewise for every other Class. Once again, this information is aimed entirely at Monks.</p><HR width="70%"><p>[INTRODUCTION]</p><p>In this Guide I will be discussing a method used to compare weapons, formulas for determing aspects of Monk weapons such as Damage Bonuses and Maximum damages, listing Hand To Hand stats per level, showing Modals, as well as a few other aspects of Monks. This is a "general" Guide in that it does not have one main focus, but rather several different ones that all Monks should be aware of. </p><HR width="70%"><p>[DAMAGE BONUSES]</p><p>Modals. As far as EverQuest and the Weapons therein goes, a "Modal" is a term given to the Average Damage of a weapon. They are used primarily in comparing the effectiveness of weapons on an even scale with other weapons, enabling someone to determine which of two or more different Damage/Delay weapons is better. For many Classes the calculated Modals for a weapon are static, in that when they equip the weapon in their Primary Slot the Modal will not change. This is not the case for Monks.</p><p>One of the defining features of the Monk Class is it's ability to "Dual Wield" starting at Level one. The ability to Dual Wield allows a player to use two weapons at once, one weapon in the "Primary" slot, and another in the "Offhand" slot. Just having the skill Dual Wield does not, however, mean that you will always strike with both weapons each round of combat. The determining factor of whether or not your Dual Wield will work is based entirely upon it's Skill Level. The higher the Skill Level, the higher the probability that Dual Wield will work causing you to attack with both weapons. The probability of succeeding with Dual Wield can get as high as 78% with a Skill Level of 252 but will not exceed it. The best chance you will ever have of having a successful Dual Wield is 78%.</p><p>For Monks there is also a slight difference between the "Primary" weapon slot and the "Offhand" one. As a Monk progresses through Levels he or she gains an inherent "Damage Bonus" for his Primary slot. This Damage Bonus is an amount of damage based upon your current Level and Weapon type that is added to the amount of damage you would normally do with your Primary weapon. The Damage Bonus applies to any and all weapons that you wield in your Primary slot. The actual amount of the Damage Bonus is not however the same for all weapon types. One Handed weapons (including Hand To Hand) and Two Handed weapons have slightly different formulas for determining the amount of the Bonus. Following this paragraph are the formulas for determing Damage Bonuses for One Handed and Two Handed Weapons as well as a table of the actual Bonuses. You'll notice that Damage Bonuses do not begin until level 28. Bare in mind also that only the "Primary" slot weapon gains a Damage Bonus. The "Offhand" weapon has no bonus whatsoever.</p><p>[DAMAGE BONUSES; One Hand Blunt / Hand To Hand]</p><p>DamageBonus = (Level - 25) / 3<br>* Damage Bonuses are always rounded down (ie, 7.65 = 7)</br>(1-27) = 0<br>(28) = 1<br>(29) = 1<br>(30) = 1<br>(31) = 2<br>(32) = 2<br>(33) = 2<br>(34) = 3<br>(35) = 3<br>(36) = 3<br>(37) = 4<br>(38) = 4<br>(39) = 4<br>(40) = 5<br>(41) = 5<br>(42) = 5<br>(43) = 6<br>(44) = 6<br>(45) = 6<br>(46) = 7<br>(47) = 7<br>(48) = 7<br>(49) = 8<br>(50) = 8<br>(51) = 8<br>(52) = 9<br>(53) = 9<br>(54) = 9<br>(55) = 10<br>(56) = 10<br>(57) = 10<br>(58) = 11<br>(59) = 11<br>(60) = 11</p><p>Using the formula and chart above, a weapon that would normally do 20 damage at level 40 would do 25 damage when equipped in the Primary slot. Likewise with Hand To Hand (H2H). At level 40 the Average Modal Damage of H2H is 24, however the primary Hand would have an Average Modal Damage of 29. Below are the formulas for calculating Damage Bonuses for Two Hand Blunt weapons. Notice that four formulas are listed. This is because the Damage Bonus for 2HB weapons is based not only on a players Level, but also the Delay of the weapon. The higher a Delay a weapon has the more Damage Bonus it gets, as illustrated by the formulas.</p><p>[DAMAGE BONUSES; Two Hand Blunt]</p><p>(FAST) IF WeaponDelay <= 27<br>1.) DamangeBonus = One Handed DamageBonus + 1<br>* Damage Bonuses are always rounded down (ie, 7.65 = 7).</p><p>(MEDIUM) IF WeaponDelay >= 28 AND <= 39 <br>1.) DamageBonus = One Handed DamageBonus + (Level - 27) / 4</p><p>(SLOW) IF WeaponDelay >= 40 AND <= 42<br>1.) DamageBonus = One Handed DamageBonus + ((Level - 27) / 4) + 1</p><p>(VERY SLOW) IF WeaponDelay > 42<br>1.) DamageBonus = One Handed DamageBonus + ((Level - 27) / 4) + (WeaponDelay - 34) / 3</p><HR width="70%"><p>[HAND TO HAND]</p><p>Knowing how to calculate Damage Bonuses is important for comparing weapons, as weapons will do more or less damage depending on which slot (Primary or Offhand) you put them in. The very best way to determine which weapon is best for which slot or a combination of weapons is to use "Compared Modals." Compared Modals are different from normal Average Damage Modals in that they are the value of a weapons "damage per tenth of second." For example, to determine how much damage a weapon would do in 4 seconds with a Compared Modal of "0.700" you would multiply 0.700 by 40 because there are 40 tenths of a second in 4 seconds, each second having 10 tenths. The result would be 28. In 4 seconds with a Compared Modal of 0.700 you would do 28 damage (40 * 0.700 = 28). Compared Modals are generally relatively small numbers. The higher the Compared Modal is, the better the weapon. Mixing and matching certain weapon combinations in different slots can result in better performance. For instance, putting a certain weapon in your Primary slot and using H2H for your Offhand might not perform as well as putting that weapon in Offhand and using H2H for Primary.</p><p>Throughout this Guide the statistics for a Monks "Hand To Hand" is used to illustrate the formulas. Here are the actual stats for Human and Iksar H2H for your reference.</p><p>[HAND TO HAND; Human]</p><p>Level ----- Damage/Delay</p><p>(1-4)   = 4/36 Delay<br>(5-9)   = 5/36 Delay<br>(10-14) = 6/36 Delay<br>(15-19) = 7/36 Delay<br>(20-24) = 8/36 Delay<br>(25-29) = 9/35 Delay<br>(30-34) = 10/34 Delay<br>(35-39) = 11/33 Delay<br>(40-44) = 12/32 Delay<br>(45-49) = 13/31 Delay<br>(50-52) = 14/30 Delay<br>(53-55) = 14/29 Delay<br>(56-58) = 14/28 Delay<br>(59)    = 14/27 Delay<br>(60)    = 14/26 Delay</p><p>[HAND TO HAND; Iksar]</p><p>Level ----- Damage/Delay</p><p>(1-4)   = 4/36 Delay<br>(5-9)   = 5/36 Delay<br>(10-14) = 6/36 Delay<br>(15-19) = 7/36 Delay<br>(20-24) = 8/36 Delay<br>(25-29) = 9/36 Delay<br>(30-34) = 10/35 Delay<br>(35-39) = 11/34 Delay<br>(40-44) = 12/33 Delay<br>(45-49) = 13/32 Delay<br>(50-52) = 14/31 Delay<br>(53-55) = 14/30 Delay<br>(56-58) = 14/29 Delay<br>(59)    = 14/28 Delay<br>(60)    = 14/27 Delay</p><HR width="70%"><p>[MODALS]</p><p>The process of calculating a Compared Modal is actually several processes combined. Initially you must determine the DamageBonus for the weapon you are considering. Then the Average Damage Modal (called "PrimaryModal" in these formulas), afterwhich you finally generate the Compared Modal (called "Compared Primary Modal" in these formulas). The following are the formulas for doing as such. Also listed are the Compared Modals for Human and Iksar H2H using the generated Damage Bonuses above, as they are the same for all Monks. Take note that the Modals change quite frequently as you level. Also remember that the higher the number is, the better.</p><p>[MODALS; PRIMARY; 1HB/H2H]</p><p>1.) DamageBonus = (Level - 25) / 3

There are two significant differences from Primary Compared Modals however. The first being that your Offhand has no Damage Bonus, therefore none is added in the calculations. The lack of a Damage Bonus does make a rather large difference in the end result of the calculations. The second difference is the Probability of Dual Wield. As mentioned earlier, there is no guarantee that your Offhand weapon will strike every round of combat. The probability of a successful Dual Wield is based on your current Level and your current Skill Level in Dual Wield. The probability of a successful Dual Wield is represented by a percentage, the most you can ever get being 78%. It is because of this that the Compared Modals for Offhand weapons are so much lower than Primary weapons Compared Modals. They have a chance of not striking at all, and thus doing no damage. Below are the formulas, including how to determin your Dual Wield Skill and Dual Wield Probability, and the actual Compared Modals for Human and Iksar Offhand H2H. Note that the Dual Wield Probabilities for each level are listed beside the Compared Modals. To determine what the actual Probability of Dual Wield at a certain level is simply take the listed value and multiply it by 100. For example, using "0.0325" as the Probability value, multiply it by 100, which equals 3.35. That is the percent chance you have of succeeding a Dual Wield. 3.25%. Notice that the Dual Wield Skill is capable of being maxxed (which is as high as it will ever go) at Level 36, with a Skill Level of 252. Also note that these calculations are made under the impression that for each level the Dual Wield Skill has already been capped (which is as high as it will go for that specific level).</p><p>[MODALS; OFFHAND]</p><p>1.)

Items or Spells are active.<br>*** Calculations made condisdering DualWieldSkill Capped for each level.</p><p>Aside from One Hand Blunt (1HB) and Hand To Hand (H2H) weapons, Monks also have the option of using Two Hand Blunt (2HB) weapons. Commonly these weapons are much slower, but their Damages are much much higher. Comparing 1HB/H2H weapons with 2HB weapons is exactly the same as comparing 1HB and H2H weapons. The Compared Modal formula works exactly the same. Quite often 2HB weapons have a higher Compared Modal than 1HB and H2H weapons. This does not however mean that they are better. With 2HB weapons you only ever have the ability to strike TWO times per round. With 1HB and H2H however, you have the ability to strike FOUR times per round. Both of these aspects, being able to strike two times per round with 2HB and four times per round with 1HB/H2H is dependant upon the "Double Attack Skill." Similar to Dual Wield, Double Attack does not always ensure success. Likewise, similar to Dual Wield, you have a Probability percentage of how often you will succeed a Double Attack. The formula for determing the Double Attack Probability is as follows.</p><p>DoubleAttackProbability = (Skill Level + Level) / 5</p><p>Below are the formulas for determing Compared Modals for 2HB weapons. It goes without saying that the Offhand slot is not available when wielding 2HB weapons, thus there is no formula for determining Compared Modals for something that isnt there.</p><p>[MODALS; PRIMARY; 2HB]</p><p>(FAST) IF WeaponDelay <= 27<br>1.)

The Maximum Damage is the most a weapon will ever hit for under it's present conditions. Strength, Weapon Skill, and Level are the three primary factors that affect it. The higher your Strength, Weapon Skill, and Level are, the higher the Maximum Damage will be. Note that the Maximum Damage of Primary 1HB/H2H is significantly higher than the Maximum Damage of Offhand 1HB/H2H. This is soley because of the Damage Bonus.</p><p>[MAXIMUM DAMAGE; PRIMARY; 1HB/H2H]</p><p>1.) DamageBonus = (Level - 25) / 3<br>* Damage Bonuses are always rounded down (ie, 7.65 = 7)<br>2.)
