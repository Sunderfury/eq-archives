            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              <p>Before I begin, I just wanted to tell everyone not to be discouraged if this looks like a lot of questing to do.  Many people question if the ring is even worth all the questing.  Believe me, it's more than worth it, these quests can be really shortly summarized but I've been very thorough.  Quests 1-8 can be done in one day, provided all the quest NPCs are up.  So get off your ass and do these quests, the reward is awesome and the quests themselves are really fun for the most part.

<p>This walkthrough is written by me, Zorac Thunderfist, Iksar Monk of Mystical Fate on the Terris-Thule server.  I did the quests at level 54.  Drop me a tell on TT server if you have any questions, or e-mail me at tenchi1147@hotmail.com

<p><b>- Quests -</b>

<p><b>1: Copper Coldain Insignia Ring:  AC1, STR+1, MR+1</b>

	<p>It all starts with Garadain Glacierbane.  He can be found in a hut at the Coldain encampment just northeast of the Ry`Gorr fort at a location of -2700, -400.  You may sometimes find these huts empty because someone is hunting the Coldain for heads and faction, but they're only on 20 minute timers.  Talk to Garadain to find out that he wants a blanket.  To tailor the blanket you must have some tailoring skill, or have someone else make it for you and multiquest the ring later because the blanket is NO DROP.  Either way, the blanket is trivial at a tailoring skill of about 80.  To make the blanket, combine two High Quality Tundra Kodiak Pelts (found from tundra kodiaks in Eastern Wastes), and two High Quality Cougarskins (found from snow cougars in either Eastern Wastes or Iceclad Ocean) in a large sewing kit.  Give the blanket to Garadain for your first ring, the Copper Coldain Insignia Ring.

<p><b>2: Silver Coldain Insignia Ring:  AC2, STR+2, MR+2</b>

<p>	Right after receiving your Copper Ring, you will want an axe from Garadain to trigger the second quest, even if you don't plan on doing it now.  The only phrase I found that works to get the axe is, "How assistance?"  Once you have the axe, go find Boridain Glacierbane who is on a hill just west of Garadain's hut at a location of -2450, +1550.  He may not be up, and he is on about a 5-6 hour timer.  In a nutshell, you'll be guiding Boridain around the zone in search of a rabid kodiak, and your goal is to make sure that he does not die.  I recommend having a monk for this, so he can pull away mobs and feign death.  Otherwise, you will need to kill the following before attempting this:  All the giants at the front of the giant fort at -1770, +2920, the static giant and orc in the jail at     -30, +300, and all orcs outside the orc fort at -3500, +400.  To get started, give Boridain the axe and he'll be on his way.  Remember to keep an out at all times for any roaming giants or orcs that look like they may collide with Boridain.  You will either need to kill them (Boridain will assist you), or pull them away and feign death if you have the ability.  

<p>Boridain first heads west to the giant fort at       -1770, +2920.  He stops right at the entrance, then starts going northeast to the jail.  Along the way he'll stop for a snack.  Use the opportunity to med, heal, whatever...but remember to watch out for giants and orcs, they will still attack.  If you don't want to wait, you may give him a food item to get him going again.  If you don't, he will still move again eventually, it just takes a few minutes.  After a couple minutes, he finishes the trip to the jail at -30, +300.  He then heads south to the orc fort, and takes another break for a nap along the way (this time you can't give him anything to get him going quicker).  When he arrives at the orc fort at -3500, +400, he will turn around and go back to his starting hill at -2450, +1550.  When he gets there, he will sit down and give up.  At this time the rabid kodiak will spawn behind you, and a short timer of about 5 minutes is activated, at the end of which Boridain will despawn. 

<p> So, kill the rabid kodiak quickly, loot his pelt, and immediately give the pelt to Boridain for a broken axe.  If Boridain despawns, you will need to get another axe from Garadain with the phrase "How assistance?", wait 4 hours for Boridain to respawn, then give the axe to Boridain to trigger the quest.  However, you don't need to wait for the rabid kodiak again.  Just give him the rabid kodiak pelt as soon as Boridain starts walking to get the broken axe.  When you're finished, give the broken axe and your Copper Coldain Insignia Ring to Garadain for the Silver Coldain Insignia Ring.  NOTE:  If someone else tailored the blanket for the first quest, they will need to turn it in for the Copper Ring and this is where you have it multiquested.  Have your friend give the ring to Garadain, then you hand in the broken axe, and you will still receive the Silver Ring.

<p><b>3: Gold Coldain Insignia Ring:  AC3, STR+3, MR+3</b>

	<p>Another quest based on a trade skill, this time smithing.  The components are all found in Eastern Wastes.  Ever seen one of those orange blobs with gray spots on the ground near the bridge to Iceclad?  Well, you'll need one of those...it's a skinning rock, and is NO DROP.  You'll also need to kill walruses just south of Kael until you have a High Quality Walrus Hide, and wooly rhinos found throughout the zone until you have a Wooly Rhino Horn.  Once you have all 3 items, combine them in a forge to attempt to make the knife.  The knife is trivial at a smithing skill of about 65.  The knife was also NOT no drop at the time I did this, so you may have someone else get a skinning rock and forge the knife, and simply give it to you.  Verant may have changed that however, but I can't confirm.  Anyway, give the knife and your Silver Coldain Insignia Ring to Garadain for the Gold Coldain Insignia Ring.  If someone else made the knife and it is no drop, you can obviously just multiquest it.

<p><b>4: Platinum Coldain Insignia Ring:  AC4, STR+4, MR+4</b>

	<p>You're going to need some help for this one, but before you recruit anybody, you should make sure that Tain Hammerfrost is up.  He's found beyond the first snowy hill that you encounter as you head west from the Iceclad/Eastern Wastes bridge, at a location of -4950, -2650.  He may not be up because people kill him for faction, or they assume he drops something neat, and he's on a 5-6 hour timer.  If he's up, you should have help from someone who can solo a giant, blue at level 54.  I personally did this with a level 55 druid. 

<p> Anyway, when whoever is helping you has arrived at  Tain, say "I will help" to trigger the quest.  As soon as you do this, 4 giants will spawn over the hill to the east, and they are all agrod on Tain.  As soon as you see the giants, attack ALL of them to switch the agro to you.  You want to keep Tain alive, and about 3-5 hits from any giant can kill him.  When you have all 4 giants chasing after you, have your helper(s) split the named one, Ghrek Squatnot, from the bunch, and kill him as you run around kiting the other 3.  You may either kill them all this way, or just Ghrek, it doesn't matter.  Either way, as soon as Ghrek is dead, loot the vial from him.  

<p>If Tain is still alive, quickly give him the vial to receive the Coldain Smithing Hammer.  If Tain is dead, you'll need to wait another 4 hours for his respawn, trigger the quest by saying "I will help", then immediately give him the vial.  The giants will despawn as soon as they lose all agro.  Once you've done it, give the Coldain Smithing Hammer and the Gold Coldain Insignia Ring to Garadain for your Platinum Coldain Insignia Ring.

<p><b>5: Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring:  AC5, STR+5, MR+5</b>

	<p>You'll need help for this too, preferably a few people this time in case something goes wrong with the pull, which is likely.  However, first thing's first, you'll need Ry`Gorr Invasion Plans.  These drop 100% of the time from the very rare, wandering Ry`Gorr Messenger.  The plans are tradeable, and the messenger is killed on sight because the plans are in pretty high demand.  So, you may be able to just buy the plans cheap from somebody.  When you have the plans, start recruiting people to help you.  You'll want as high a level as possible to pull, so as not to get adds. 

<p> Do not try to harmony, you won't have time.  When your help has arrived, have them all buff up at the hill where people camp in front of the orc fort.  When ready, you and only you will head over to Garadain's camp with the invasion plans.  Locate the coldain lookout in this camp behind one of the huts.  Giving him the plans will spawn about 8 orcs, all blue at level 54, in the field just west of Garadain's camp.  Among these orcs is a 47th level shadow knight named Scarbrow Ga`Hruk.  Immediately when they spawn, have the highest level helping you try to pull Scarbrow.  The orcs only remain static for a brief moment before charging Garadain's camp, and once all agro is lost, they will despawn.  

<p>Garadain's camp is more than guaranteed to be wiped out, but this is not a problem.  Just focus on killing Scarbrow.  Take care of any adds as best you can.  I personally had a level 56 shaman pull Scarbrow, and he got him single.  When Scarbrow is dead, loot his head.  He also has a chance of dropping a Frozen Orb, which is a pretty nice range item (AC2, WIS+3, INT+3, mana+40).  If it does drop, it is not needed for any quests.  When Garadain respawns, give him Scarbrow's head and your Platinum Coldain Insignia Ring for the Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring.

<p><b>6: Mithril Coldain Insignia Ring:  AC6, STR+6, MR+6</b>

	<p>You need help again, from a team about as powerful as the one that helped you with Scarbrow.  But first, you have an option.  You can either do the part that requires help, or you can camp the Coldain traitor named Rodrick Tardok.  Rodrick spawns in the little tower that serves as a zone out of Crystal Caverns, at a location of -3400, +1050.  However, he isn't on a timer, rather is triggered when the fairly rare Ry`Gorr Emissary walks up to the tower.  When this happens, be careful not to agro the emissary, and wait a minute for Rodrick to spawn.  You may want to ask the zone not to kill the emissary.  He spawns in the orc fort and chances are he won't make it out alive.  

<p>When Rodrick has spawned, go ahead and kill him.  He's easy, green to me at 54.  When dead he drops his head and a no drop "Dirk of the Traitor".  Loot BOTH of these.  You only need the head right now but the Dirk is for the ninth quest.  Now gather your army and head to the single hut just north of the Iceclad/Eastern Wastes bridge at -3300, -4480.  Wait until midnight then kill everything in and around the hut.  If someone is camping it, tell them they should stay back because you're about to do a quest here.  As your friends are clearing the hut, you should head to the southwest corner of the zone to two huts, empty aside from a named dire wolf, Icefang. 

<p>Icefang is on the Coldain faction so should not attack you, and his location is -8100, +3230.  If it's past midnight you should also find a dwarf ghost outside of Icefang's hut named Korrigain.  When your friends are ready, give your Obsidian Ring to Korrigain, you'll get it back but this triggers Icefang to walk out, stop a moment, then run off to the hut where your friends are.  Run as fast you can back to that hut.  A minute before Icefang arrives, a few orcs will spawn outside the hut, and a named level 40 shaman inside named Poxbreath Yellowfang.  Have the highest level there try to pull Poxbreath out single.  When Icefang arrives, he'll fight the orcs and will die, but this isn't a problem.  Loot the note from Poxbreath when he's dead.  Return to Garadain and give him Rodrick's head, the note from Poxbreath, and your Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring to receive the Mithril Coldain Insignia Ring.

<p><b>7: Adamantium Coldain Insignia Ring:  AC7, STR+7, MR+7</b>

	<p>This quest has a really easy way to cheat, so you only need one person to do this...that person is a monk.  But first thing's first.  You'll need to kill Warden Bruke in the jail.  You should have at least 2 people to do this, he's kind of tough and is completely MR.  You can run around with the Warden on you as another hits him from behind.  May take a while, but it works.  Anyway, head to the jail and locate the ruined building in the northeast corner.  Warden Bruke spawns in this building at a location of +300, -350.  He does have a PH which is an all caps "Kromrif Prison Guard".  

<p>The PH and Warden are on about 7 minute timers.  When the Warden is up, have the monk pull him even though he's alone.  Have him pull from the hole in the right side of the building.  The reason for this is, once agrod, 6 bodyguards will spawn at the entrance of the building, but they won't agro if you pull from the side.  If they do, have a monk pulling so he can split the Warden.  Once the Warden is dead, loot the no drop Shackle Key.  The femur is extra and not needed.  Once you have the Shackle Key, locate Corbin Blackwell in a building in the jail at +215, +80.  He's surrounded by 5 mobs, all of which are green and I could solo easily as a level 54 monk.  However, don't kill these yet.  Locate Dobbin Crossaxe in a hut east of the jail at -570, -3190.  

<p>Have yourself and your monk (if you're not the monk) familiarize yourselves with the path from Corbin to Dobbin.  When you think you've got it, kill all the mobs around Corbin.  Here's what's going to happen.  When you give Corbin the Mithril Ring and the Shackle Key, you get the ring back but not the key.  Immediately run back to Dobbin's hut, but have the monk stay with Corbin at all times.  If you are the monk, obviously you won't be running back to Dobbin.  As soon as you give the key and ring to Corbin, he starts walking out of the jail.  Once out, he proceeds over some hills for about a minute, then says something like, "Almost there, just a little but farther now."  A second after this happens, 8 mobs will spawn around you including Commander Bahreck.  


<p>The Commander shouts something to the zone when this happens.  IMMEDIATELY when he does this, have the monk attack Corbin once to agro him, then run out of the path of the mobs who should be currently charging.  If done correctly, the mobs will come to where Corbin was and stop there dumbfounded.  They will then roam the zone.  Anyway, the monk is still running around with Corbin on him.  Simply run to Dobbin's hut (only if the mobs have not agrod), and feign death once Corbin is inside.  Corbin will walk out of the hut and immediately come back inside.  Dobbin and Corbin will chat for a minute, then Corbin despawns and Dobbin tells you to give him your ring.  

<p>Do what he says, give Dobbin the Mithril Ring and you receive a note in return (you will not get the ring back).  If this part of the quest fails and Corbin is killed because the monk sucks at running him out the way, you'll need to kill Warden Bruke for the key and try again.  Once you have the note from Dobbin, return to Garadain.  Give Garadain Dobbin's note for the Adamantium Coldain Insignia Ring.

<p><b>8: Velium Coldain Insignia Ring:  AC8, STR+8, MR+8, Effect: Shield of the Eighth (Right-clickable and stackable 8 point damage shield)</b>

	<p>Ever seen all those mobs at the front of the orc fort?  Well that's you're about to do - war.  But there's a way around this that isn't exactly a war.  First thing you'll want to do is make sure Gloradin Coldheart is up in the hut next to Garadain's, at a location of -2630, -440.  She's most likely not going to be up.  She's on a 24 hour timer and may be killed because of the little war with Scarbrow, or because someone is stupid and kills her for faction, or because someone does the 8th quest.  When she's up, start the recruiting and ask the zone not to kill her.  One group is plenty, but the more the merrier because you only have one chance to do this.  

<p>If you fail, all is lost, and you have to start from ring one.  I personally did this with me (54 monk) a level 53 paladin, 60 cleric, and 40 druid.  I also did it later for a friend, we had me (54 monk), him (58 monk), a 42 paladin, 56 cleric and 53 wizard.  You must have a way to invis everyone, whether you use potions or whatever.  We easily succeeded both times.  When your team has arrived, head inside the orc fort.  Go into the building in the middle room with the big fire.  Kill whatever is up in the building, including elites and even the chief if he happens to be up.  When the whole building is clear, everyone should buff up and med up, and it is imperative that you warn the zone numerous times that war is about to start and everyone should stay clear of the fort.  It's possible for a newbie to screw everything up.  When ready, you will run outside to Garadain, while your team stays behind inside the room with the fire.  You need an invis potion unless you can invis yourself.  

<p>If you can't and you have no potion, have someone who can invis go with you.  Give the Adamantium ring to Garadain to receive a note.  Go to the other building with Gloradin and give her the note.  Immediately invis yourself, if you can't then have whoever went with you invis you and himself.  Once invisible, run back into the room with the fire.  You only have about 2 minutes before all the mobs pop.  Invis at this point is not 100% required but you should still have it just in case you're slow going back inside and the mobs pop.  Anyway, when you and everyone else is inside the middle room with the fire, and all the mobs have popped outside, look just outside your room.  You will see two giants and some orcs including Firbrand the Black and Chief Ry`Gorr.  Yes, they are outside the building because this is special.  You only NEED the Chief, so have the highest level pull him inside.  

<p>At level 54, I attempted to pull him and got him with Firbrand, but no others.  Your target is the Chief so drop him as quickly as possible, and loot his head when he's dead.  As soon as whatever you pulled is dead (hopefully just the Chief) and you have the head, everyone needs to have invis and run completely outside of the fort.  You will run to the hill outside of the fort where groups camp orcs for exp.  On this hill, you should see an army of Coldain preparing for the war.  If they're not there yet, wait a minute and they will run up and stop there.  A minute after the Coldain army arrives, Garadain will walk up to the army and stop there to give them a pep talk.  A bit after that, he shouts, 'CHARGE!'  

<p>As soon as he does this, give Garadain the Chief's head to receive your Velium Coldain Insignia Ring.  You can actually give him the head before he shouts CHARGE, but if you wait, the Coldain will charge the fort.  As you can see you need to kill the Chief as fast as possible because if you take too long, the Coldain will charge the fort and get wiped out.  If Garadain dies, all is lost and you must start from ring one.  So be fast, focused, understand what you must do, and do it.  This is not as hard as it may seem.
