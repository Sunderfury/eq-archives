    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0">People play
      warriors for many reasons. The item-collection aspect is considered by
      many to be a lot of fun. People like being in the thick of things, like
      having lots of HP and a high AC, or enjoy the roleplaying aspects of it.
      Others enjoy the role a warrior plays in a group. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>2. Isn't
      the complete and total lack of spells really limiting? </B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0">Yes, very.
      But people who play warriors either learn to work around that admittedly
      large restriction, or switch classes. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>3. But it

    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0">Whether a
      class is fun or not is totally a personal thing. Certain people enjoy
      certain classes for reason they may or may not be able to explain. You are
      encouraged to try every class/race combo that seems even minorly fun until
      you find the one (or more than one for some people) that you can enjoy the
      most. </FONT></P>

        What stats are important to a warrior?</A></B> Strength, Stamina,

        What do the stats actually do?</A></B> For the melee stats we have
      received no formulae from Verant detailing their effects, only generalized
      statements. Independant testing by warriors and non-warriors alike has
      supported each of the statements, and at this time all are believed to be
      true. They are: --- </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>DEX:</B>
      how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how
      quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows (per Abashi,
      dex also increases the chance of critical hits) </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>STR:</B>
      determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage;
      influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>STA:</B>
      affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath
      </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>INT:</B>
      directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount
      of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>WIS:</B>
      affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers/paladins;

      is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit ---
      </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0">Testing has
      also revealed that stat increases don't have a very large impact on
      real-world performance. It takes a large increase to see a small
      difference, and in most cases the trade-offs required to make the large
      increase aren't worth the minimal increases gained. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B><A NAME="3">1.3
        What other stats are important to warriors?</A></B> Your armor class
      (AC), your ATK (attack), and your hit points (HP) are all very important.
      </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B><A NAME="4">1.4
        What affects AC and what does AC do?</A></B> Your AC is a combination of
      your Defense skill, your Agility, and any items you have equipped that
      give AC. Iksars also have an innate AC bonus, approximately 40 AC at 50th
      level. AC is a composite skill, comprising both your ability to avoid
      damage, and in the event of being hit, your ability to mitigate the
      damage. The higher the better, and warrior armor has the highest AC in the
      game. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B><A NAME="5">1.5
        What affects ATK and what does it do?</A></B> Your ATK is affected by
      your strength, your Offense skill, and your skill with whichever weapon
      type you are currently using. ATK is a composite of your ability to hit,
      and your ability to do damage. Strength does not increase your ability to
      hit, only to damage. No stats affect your ability to hit. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B><A NAME="6">1.6
        How are my hit points determined?</A></B> You gain a certain number of
      hit points per level (starting in the mid 20's and eventually rising as
      high as 40 per level for ogres with max stamina). At 20 you gain
      approximately 2x what you received at 19th level. At 30 you receive
      approximately 2x what you received at 20th level, and at 40 you receive
      approximately 3x what you received at 20th level. There is also a large HP
      boost at level 53, and possibly more HP boosts. [more info will be
      forthcoming on this as the  facts become available] In the 40's, your
      naked HP can be accurately determined with this formula: HP =
      Lvl*(27+stm/11). Note that this formula is inaccurate at lower levels due
      to the rising number of HP gained per level. Warriors have the most hit
      points of any class. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B><A NAME="7">1.7
        What is berserk?</A></B> Berserk is what happens when a warrior gets
      beat to 40% health or less. Strength increases a bit, thus increasing ATK
      a bit, but more importantly it enables you to land crippling blows, which
      can do large amounts of damage. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B><A NAME="8">1.8
        Why is my magic resist stat in green?</A></B> Warriors have innately
      higher magic resistance than other classes. It goes up 1 point every even
      level. If your base magic resist is 25, at 50th level it will hit 50.
      Resistances are more fully explained in a later section. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>1.9 What
      skills do warriors have? </B>Offensive skills: kick, bash (slam), 1H
      slash, 2H slash, 1H blunt, 2H blunt, piercing, throwing, hand to hand,
      archery, offense Defensive skills: dodge, parry, riposte, defense Misc
      skills: dual wield, double attack, bind wounds, taunt, disarm </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B><A NAME="10">1.10
        What do all the skills do? </A></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Kick:</B>
      Allows you to kick an opponent for low to moderate damage. This is a
      secondary attack and functions on its own timer, which is shared with bash
      (you can't do both at the same time). At level 55 kick gains a chance to
      stun. Warriors start with kick. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Bash:</B>
      The slam skill posessed by ogres, trolls, and barbarians allows them to
      bash without a shield, but it uses the same skill. For other races, bash
      is a secondary attack that shares its timer with kick. It requires a
      shield (except for large races) and does low to moderate damage, plus has
      a chance to stun the monster, causing it to stop moving/attacking for a
      couple seconds as well as interrupting its spellcasting. Large races start
      with slam (at zero skill), bash is gained at level 6. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>1H Slash,
      2H Slash, 1H Blunt, 2H Blunt, and Piercing: </B>These weapon skills are
      used for weapons of the appropriate type. Right-clicking and holding on a
      weapon will show you what type of weapon it is. With the expansion Ruins
      of Kunark there are good warrior-usable weapons in all 5 categories. All
      weapon skills are available for use at level 1. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Throwing:</B>
      Of limited usefulness to warriors, throwing is your skill with thrown
      weapons, such as throwing daggers, shuriken, and throwing boulders. Thrown
      weapons typically have much shorter ranges than arrows, but shorter delays
      as well. Available at level 1. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Hand to
      Hand:</B> This is your ability to use your fists as a weapon. Even with
      very high hand to hand skill, a warrior cannot duplicate a monk's fists.
      This skill is of very limited use to warriors. Available at level 1.
      </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Archery:</B>
      This is your skill with a bow and arrows. This is a highly useful skill to
      posess for pulling purposes, though technically your ability to hit
      doesn't matter, because a monster will attack you whether you damaged it
      or not. On PvP servers, it's much more valuable to have a high archery
      skill. Available at level 1. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Offense:</B>
      This is your general ability to attack and do damage, which is applied in
      conjuction with your weapon skill and strength to determine your ATK
      rating. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Dodge:</B>
      This is your ability to dodge an attack. It is not affected by your AC.
      Dodge is gained at level 6. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Parry:
      </B>This is your ability to parry an attack with a weapon. It is not
      affected by your AC. Parry is gained at level 10. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Riposte:</B>
      This is your ability to riposte an attack (parry their attack and get a
      free attack in on them). It is not affected by your AC. Riposte is gained
      at level 25. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Defense:</B>
      This is your general ability to avoid attacks and mitigate damage. It is
      applied in conjuction with your agility and your armor to determine your
      AC. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Dual
      Wield:</B> This is your ability to use two weapons at the same time. The
      formula is (LVL+Skill)/600, so a 20th level warrior with 105 dual wield
      skill has a 20.8% chance of swinging his second weapon each time its delay
      cycles. The delay of the primary weapon does not affect the secondary
      weapon. Dual wield is gained at level 13. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Double
      Attack:</B> This is your ability to attack twice with a weapon per delay
      cycle. It is slightly easier to double attack than to dual wield. The
      formula is (LVL+Skill)/500, so a 20th level warrior with 105 double attack
      skill has a 25% chance of double attacking on each successful attack.
      Double attacks with your offhand are almost unmeasurably rare until
      sometime around 150 skill. Double attack is gained at level 15. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Bind
      Wounds:</B> This is your ability to bind wounds. It requires one bandage
      per attempt, and the bandage is consumed. Bind wounds never fails unless
      you are interrupted during the process. You heal yourself (or your target)
      Skill/4 HP, rounded down, per bandage. Warriors begin with the ability to
      bind wounds. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Taunt:</B>
      This is your ability to taunt a monster to cause it to switch targets to
      you. This is an extremely valuable skill. If you successfully taunt, the
      monster switches to you regardless of the damage or taunting of others. If
      you fail, nothing happens. Taunting a monster that is already attacking
      you is useless, whether it succeeds or not. Warriors begin with the
      ability to taunt. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Disarm:</B>
      This is your ability to disarm your target's weapon. This is of virtually
      no use except when dualling or on PvP servers. Even with very high skill
      it is very difficult to disarm, and you can't disarm magic weapons (on
      monsters). Disarm is gained at level 35. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#0000A0"><B><A NAME="11">1.11
        What are the skill caps?</A></B> Before level 51, all skills for
      warriors rise at 5 per level, with an additional 5 to start. The formula
      to determine max skill is (LVL*5)+5. (LVL+1)*5 also works. After level 51
      when the skill caps are increased, some skills gain more than 5 points per
      level and some gain less. [Post 50 skill increase information to follow at
      a later date] </FONT></P>

      require you to first invest at least one training point in order to be
      able to use and/or advance them. Go to any warrior trainer and right click
      on them, scroll down the list to find the skill, and train as desired (you
      get 5 training points to start with and 5 more each time you level). You
      cannot Dodge, Parry, Riposte, Double Attack, Dual Wield, or Bash unless
      you have trained them at least once. Note that large races can slam from
      the beginning, but with a zero skill. When they gain bash the slam ability
      starts using the bash skill. You can use the Taunt skill without training
      it first but you will be unable to advance the skill, so you should
      definitely place at least one point in Taunt at a trainer. </FONT></P>
