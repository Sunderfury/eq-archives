          <ul>
            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              <p>I had heard mention of the bloodgills, but because I'm human and a terrible swimmer, I didn't really give them much thought. But since soloing has gotten tougher, I had to try them...and boy, did it pay off.

<p><b>WHAT YOU NEED:</b>
<br>Lots of bandages
<br>Lots of Shurikens
<br>Underwater Breathing potions - sold in FV near bank on a small dock, 11pp or so each. If you have fishbone earring, your good to go. Don't worry about the price; the goblins are gonna buy them for you several times over. 

<p><b>TACTICS:</b>

<p>Take off into Lake of ill omen. My starting point is the platform who's base is slightly underwater. You can sit on this safely to regain stamina. The first pair of gobbies is directly under this platform, so swim down and chuck a shuriken at one. At 49, I was able to single pull every single time. 9 out of 10 are blue to 49, 5/10 are blue at 50. All give xp, even greens at 50. Kill one, loot up, pull the other. I haven't calculated respawn, but it's probably in the neighborhood of 12 minutes.

<p>After the platform pillar, head west along the top of the building and you'll come to another tall structure with 2 goblins next to it...again, very easy to split, just stay as far back as shurikens allow. Kill those 2, then drop down (swim off edge of building), and head south. You'll come to the entrance to the old building, a giant iksar statue with 2 gobbies guarding it... before killing them, there are single goblins on 2 pillars just out from the door, kill them. Then, TRY to single pull the goblins by the door. 

<p>Here is a problem though: Often, there will be a marauder in there, considerably tougher than regular bloodgills..and he never seems to want to split off from them. I ended up taking him with a passing enchanter, so be careful, he puts up a hell of a fight. 

<p>OK, once you do this, you have killed 8 (or 9) goblins..of course, you didn't do it so quickly, you took time to go back to the top platform and bandage/regain stamina, didnt you? Anyway, I got everything broken and in a groove so well that I was killing 8, sitting for only a minute or so, then they started on respawn. Literally did 49 in about 6 hours.

<p><b>BACKGROUND INFO ON BLOODGILLS:</b>

<p>No idea what level, my math is terrible. Most blue to 49, but greening at 50, so you figure it out =P. They hit for max 78ish, and double attack and kick (for you soloers that really keep up with damage). I only had to feign them off a few times at 49, never yet at 50, and they are static so feigning them is easy. They drop 3 or 4pp often, and decent gems/spells/runes that sell for a good bit. I was buying all my potions, shurikens, and bandages, and had 10-20 pp left to put back in bank (ran to FV every bubble or so to restock). 

<p><b>BACKGROUND INFO ON LESTAIR:</b>

<p>Lestair Shadowfist is a friendly human monk of Tunare (lol). Ok, Wu's stick, KD, FBSS, RoTLC...same as any other monk of this level pretty much. My AC is terrible, and I managed to live, so you can too. My swimming skill was around 100 when i got here, it's pushing 185 now..goes up nicely, now I can outswim the goblins (if I decide to ID kite them). 

<p>Good luck, let me know if I missed anything!

<p>UPDATE: ok, missed something. All four corners on top have 2 each, so the total is 12, 13 with marauder up. Also, an addendum on exp...still getting fair xp at 51, though it slows considerably. About 1/3 to 1/2 are no xp greens, but if you're not sharing the spawn there are enough to make up for it. Still a few blues at 51 also.
