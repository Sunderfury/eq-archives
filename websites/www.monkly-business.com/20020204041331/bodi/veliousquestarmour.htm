      quest armour for the Monk Class, and is high (45+) level armour. The
      Quests originate with Lorekeeper Einar, at location -642.00, 43.00, in the
      Dwarven town of Thurgadin. To reach him, go over the bridge as you zone
      in, and go up some stairs on the right hand side. You will find at the end
      of that corridor a Dwarf called Lieutenant Grimur, who guards the PvP
      Arena. He is to the right, and on the left is a door (easily missed by
      some) which leads to a corridor, and an opening guarded by 2 guards.
      Within this room is Lorekeeper Einar.</FONT></P>
