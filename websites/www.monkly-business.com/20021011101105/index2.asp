          <p class="MB_Body"><p>Well, it seems as though Verant have seen all those Monk Tanks, you know, the ones dressed in Full Plate standing in front of the high end Luclin Mobs and showing up when you type the secret command /w War 60, and have this to say at this <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=52118">&gt;Link&lt;</a>.

<p><ul><i><b>* Monk Defense</b>.  Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  

<p>This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as "Monk Loot," as far back as before the launch of Kunark.

<p>Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.

<p>This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem.
  
<p>Monk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)  It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.

<p>Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.</ul></i>

<p>Far be it for me to comment on this as I am not at the point where I am on enough to activly pull for my guild (and thus wont die even more than our handbags already do at the moment), nor am I equipt at the level some others are with regard to very high AC items to discuss the finer points of the AC softcap - but I am going to chuck my oar in anyway.

<p>I have not seen any high level guilds using Monks as main Tanks for the simple reason that our damage is taken so randomly, where as a Defensive warrior can control and know his damage taken for 3 minutes, and if this is not enough, another Warrior takes his place. Where is there a spot for a monk in that setup?

<p>You know how high end encounters are run. You mention them in the above link. Stick a warrior or three in front of a mob, stick a little army of CHing Clerics in, and the rest of the raid attack. Where is there an instance of a monk Tanking a Mob? Rampage damage possibly, but Tanking?

<p>What about the impact this potentially has on soloing xp mobs? I dont have any AA points, and as mentioned by many other Monks, with the few disciplines that we have which are actually worth using being defensive, what exactly did you (verant) have in mind for us? And more to the point, why bloody change your minds now?
