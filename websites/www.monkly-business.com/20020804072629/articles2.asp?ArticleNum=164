<h3><a name="gnt"></a>Guides and Tactics</h3>

<p><b><a name="gt1"></a>Q: How do I split mobs, shake off adds, not bring too much mobs, and pull at a constant rate?</b>

<p>A: Check <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=98" target=new>Laotzu's Guide to Advanced Pulling</a>.



<p><b><a name="gt2"></a>Q: What is "Tag Pulling"?</b>

<p>A: Tag Pulling, also known as Chain Pulling, is different from, and yet similar to, chain aggro. Instead of each mob being triggered by the previous mob, players take turns triggering each other. 

<p>If a mob is particularly dangerous, or the group camp spot is particularly far away, and it is unlikely that a single puller could bring this mob that far without dying, tag pulling is often used. Multiple pullers, usually all with the ability to Feign Death, either through spells or abilities, help bring the mob or mobs to the group. The first puller will aggro the mob and begin to run back to the group. When they reach a certain spot, or get too low on life, they will use Feign Death. The second puller stays back out of aggro range and has two choices. They can aggro all the mobs the first puller brought, or they can wait for some of them to wander off before pulling just a subset of them. There can be as many "legs" of a pull as necessary to cover the distance back to the group. 



<p><b><a name="gt3"></a>Q: I am an Iksar, how do I raise faction so I can bank in (Insert city here)?</b>

<p>A: What you need is <a href="http://perso.respublica.fr/fayguardians/Guides/Factions/Factions.html" target=new>Anezka's Faction Guide</a>.  It will tell you everything.<p>


<h3><a name="sns"></a>Stats and Skills</h3>

<p><b><a name="sns1"></a>Q: What's the ratio on my hands?</b>

<p>A: You can find the answer in the <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=70" target=new>Monk hand-to-hand Damage/Delay Table</a>. Once you get your epic, your fists will be 9/16, whether you're human or iksar.



<p><b><a name="sns2"></a>Q: What's this weight limit thing, and what's my weight limit?  I'm level X.</b>

<p>A: Monks lose AC if they go over their weight limit (not their encumbrance limit -- this weight limit's a lot lower).  The higher level you are, and the further you exceed your limit, the more AC you lose; we're not quite sure what the formula is.  You can find your weight limit at any level in <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=107" target=new>Monkly-Business' guide on the subject</a>.



<p><b><a name="sns3"></a>Q: What level do Monks get Feign Death?</b>

<p>A: Level 17 for both Human and Iksar monks. The skill must be trained.



<p><b><a name="sns4"></a>Q: What breaks a successful Feign?</b>

<p>A: Two things will break a sucessful feign: (1) getting hit by any spell except a dispell, beneficial or harmful, including AEs, and (2) moving.  There are lots of things that could make you move while FD -- steep slopes, accidentally right-clicking on a corpse (and thereby looting it) when you're trying to con a mob, or finishing a bandage all count as movement.



<p><b><a name="sns5"></a>Q: How often does Feign Death fail?</b>

<p>A: After reaching Skill Level 100(Master), I would say the rate of failure is about 5%, possibly less. In these instances you receive a "[character name] has fallen to the ground" message, and the feign was never successful.  This is not a broken feign, it's a failed one.



<p><b><a name="sns6"></a>Q: What is my chance of memory-wiping a Mob?</b>

<p>A: When feigning off mobs under level 32, Feign Death memory-wipes the mob every time it succeeds. With NPCs higher than level 32, you will usually(still have a chance of mem-wiping a mob at this level, just a much smaller chance) remain on the aggro list until they path back to their spawn point(assuming they left it to chase you) but they will ignore you if you don't stand back up. Once they reach their spawn point, they have approximately a 90% chance of forgetting you. If they do not forget you, they will have a larger aggro radius than usual with regards to you. One workaround is to camp out or use the /q feature. After a couple of minutes you can re-connect and you will know for sure you are off their hate list.



<p><b><a name="sns7"></a>Q: Are there any known bugs in Feign Death?</b>

<p>A: There are a few known bugs, all of which are notorious for being hard to repeat and hard to fix.  Sometimes, when using the first person view, attempting to immediately stand up after feigning will cause you to be unable to move. Sitting, then standing again will clear this, but be very careful because even green mobs will aggro on you if you sit. When pulling higher-level creatures I would recommend using a third-person view anyway, so practice using both the view and the skills early.  There is also a very annoying bug which causes FD to fail with no messages sometimes when there are multiple characters on a mob's aggro list(almost all the time during grouping/raiding). This is still being researched by Verant staff, and they seem to have reduced its occurrence (though it's not been totally fixed yet).



<p><b><a name="sns8"></a>Q: When I get a new special attack, should I stop using the old one?</b>

<p>A: Generally, yes. The newest special attack you have available is usually the best one to use. However, you may want to keep your Dragon Punch and Eagle Strike/Tail Rake skills up to speed, as some of our 50+ disciplines, and one of our Alternate Advancement skills use these abilities.



<p><b><a name="sns9"></a>Q: What is AAXP? When can I use it? </b>

<p>A: Alternative Adancement Experience. You need to be level 51 or higher and have Everquest: Shadows of Luclin installed on your computer to enable it.



<p><b><a name="sns10"></a>Q: How do I enable AAXP? Do I choose the skill first then alot what percentage of xp I want going to that skill?</b>

<p>A: In fullscreen mode(Not the view with all the buttons), press the 'V' key, as how you press the 'I' key to open your inventory. You earn the points first and then you alot them to whichever skill(s) you prefer.



<p><b><a name="sns11"></a>Q: What are the AAXP titles for monks?</b>

<p>A: Baron(ess) at 6 points, Brother/Sister at either 18 or 24 points, Sensei at 42 points.



<p><b><a name="sns12"></a>Q: Which AAXP skills should I go after first?</b>

<p>A: Most people go for regen and run speed in the base skills, and then combat stability and combat agility in the archetypes, with Finishing Blow and comabt fury being other popular choices.



<p><b><a name="sns13"></a>Q: I just dinged, what new discipline did I get and what's it do?</b>



<p>A: Monk Disciplines can be found <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=69" target=new>here</a>.<p>


<h3><a name="mbb"></a>The Monkly-Business Boards</h3>

<p><b><a name="mbb1"></a>Q: How do I make a sig?</b>

<p>A: <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=586.topic">Mr. Meogi's guide to signatures</a> is an excellent place to look.



<p><b><a name="mbb2"></a>Q. What is wrong with "Sig test" posts? I am horrible at trying to get mine to work, I need to test it.</b>



<p>A. They clutter up the board and kick informative topics back pages while people check there purty pictures. Go check out How to Make an EZ Board Signature by Meogi San on sig making, and testing. 

<p>Not to mention that you can click the handy dandy "Preview" box to see if your sig is working without making an actual post =)<p>


<h3><a name="msc"></a>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p><b><a name="msc1"></a>Q: I gave my character X weapon and Y armor from startup and I guess you can say I twinked, does that make me a bad person? </b>

<p>A: No it does not. Arguably. With certain restrictions. Don't worry about it either way, whatever makes you happy in the game do it. But, don't come here for validation of your twinking it just causes three page flame threads.



<p><b><a name="msc2"></a>Q: How do I powerlevel my Shaman friend?</b>

<p>A: <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=280.topic">Harrington's guide to powerleveling</a> should give you a good start.



<p><b><a name="msc3"></a>Q: How do I reduce my lag on big raids?</b>

<p>A: <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=547.topic">Shtieek's guide to lowering lag on raids</a> will inform and delight you.



<p><b><a name="msc4"></a>Q: What's the FD bug, and what can I do to fix it?</b>

<p>A: "The FD bug" that people refer to is the one where you hit the FD key, fall over, don't get any of the various failure messages, but you still get beaten on like a madman. Some things you can do to fix it -- 

<p>1. Make sure that autoattack is off when you hit FD. Make sure autoattack has been off long enough to catch up to your lag; that means waiting at least 3 seconds, if you're on a dialup or under raid lag.

<p>2. Move around a bit before you FD (unless you habitually get the "you have moved and are no longer feigning death" message). Most people jump back.

<p>3. Make sure that the failure wasn't caused by something more mundane, like a message you missed due to spam or lag.



<p>Also, guides usually don't give rezzes for deaths due to "The FD Bug", since it's not a recognized one. Also, VI's said that they've tried to fix this one, and its occurrence has been greatly reduced since they've said it.



<p><b><a name="msc5"></a>Q: I failed FD 6 times in a row when I logged on right after the most recent patch! has there been a nerf to FD?</b>

<p>A: Have you checked with other monks on your server? Chances are, it's just a bad string of failures. It happens to everyone -- it's just the luck of the draw. If there is a bug that's causing FD failures, chances are this board will explode over it. 



<p><b><a name="msc6"></a>Q: What is the Mend bug? </b>

<p>This bug only occurs if you hit mend very soon after it has ungreyed. Upon hitting mend, instead of receiving back a quarter of your health you receive the message "You must wait 'x' seconds before you can Mend again."  X is normally between 0 and 6, however the message is a big fib, and basically if you see it, Mend greys out and you have to wait the full six minutes.



<p>It was fixed once, and then re-appeared recently after the Luclin launch.



<p>You can camp out and come back and the button will be ungreyed, if you really need to mend RIGHT NOW (i.e. to keep your spawn timing at the Raster camp).  The root cause of the bug (and any other "you must wait X seconds before you can Y again" ones) is fluctuating lag. The scenario is like this:



<p>(under heavy lag)

<p>1. You hit the Mend button. Your computer starts a 6-minute timer until it ungreys Mend again, and sends a "Mend me!" packet to the EQ server.

<p>2. Several seconds pass while your "Mend me!" packet wends its way to the server.

<p>3. The server finally gets the packet, updates your health, and starts a 6-minute timer until you can mend again.

<p>4. The lag abates during the next 6 minutes.

<p>5. Your mend button ungreys, and you (being at .5bubbles with two mobs beating on you) bash it like a madman. Your computer sends a "Mend me!" packet again, and starts another timer.

<p>6. Since you're not lagging anymore, the packet gets to the server quickly-- so quickly, in fact, that it hasn't been 6 minutes since the server last recieved a "Mend me!" packet from you. Thinking that you're a hacking bastid, the server tells you you have to wait before you mend again.

<p>7. At this point, the server wouldn't mind at all getting another Mend packet from you. After all, it's been more than 6 minutes since your last Mend. But the client thinks you Mended just now, so it won't let you push the button for another 6 minutes.


<p>8. You camp out and come back. Part of this process is asking the server which skills you can use, and Mend is one of the ones you can -- so the client ungreys the button.
