Eye</em>|Relentless&gt;</font></h1>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Overview</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Solusek's Eye, also referrred to
as Solusek A or SolA, is one of the most underutilized dungeons
in the game. It's one of the bigger dungeons, with a ton of great
xp and items to be found. One of the biggest problems with the
dungeon, however, is that usually the level range that it is
targeted at does not come here. Most of the time because high
levels (45-50) are usually camping many of the named monsters
which drop the best items in the dungeon. Many of the items in
this dungeon are some of the best non-planar non-dragon items in
the game.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately, I did not start
doing this dungeon for experience until about level 38, so I
don't know as much as I should about killing the fire goblins,
etc, for experience. I'll try to relate what I do know however.
The zone can be accessed through either Solusek B (Nagafen's
Lair) or Lavastorm. There is one entrance from lavastorm and four
entrances from Sol B. Any of these zones except the lavastorm
entrance is a good place to fight in case your party needs to
make a quick exit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are two things in this
dungeon that most people are turned off by: Lava and Large Races.
There are quite a few places in the zone that have lava, which
can be dangerous, taking off lots of life very quickly, and
making corpse recovery very difficult. I personally have never
fallen in the lava once. Perhaps this is mostly my good fortune,
but almost everyone I know that's hunted in Solusek A has never
complained about falling into the lava. There are many places to
fight in Solusek A that are nowhere near lava. Still, it is a
danger you should be aware of.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The other problem is that many of
the corridors are too small for the large races to pass through.
My only advice here is to use the Shrink spell, or don't come
here with a large race character. You will find it very hard to
fight if you can't reduce your size.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The monsters here range from the
Young Goblins at level 20, up to the Clockwork Guardians and
named gnomes who can reach level 34. The rare lava elemental is
around 38. You can get good experience hunting here up to level
45.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Solusek's Eye can basically be
divided into three major sections. The first section, the entry
area, is mostly goblins, with some other monsters thrown in, and
a few gnomes. This is what I call the entry zone, even though it
is a huge area. To the south is the Goblin Castle, which has lots
of goblins, including some of the higher level ones (Inferno and
Solusek goblins). To the east is the Gnome Castle, which houses
the Solusek Mining Company, its clockwork guardians, and a rare
lava elemental friend of theirs. Both of the castles have a
merchant in them, making it quite easy to get rid of loot.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The spawn time on the entire
dungeon is around 20 minutes, but alot of spawns will skip a
round for some unknown reason (much like permafrost). I've seen
two hours go by where a certain spot hasn't spawned once. Some
people claim that certain spawns have to be killed in order to
trigger the next one to spawn, but I've seen no evidence of this.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Monsters</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are basically two main
inhabitants of Solusek's Eye: Goblins and Gnomes. They are not
hostile to each other, but the goblins are hostile to most all
players, and the gnomes are hostile to evil races. Both
inhabitants have faction hits and bonuses for killing them. The
goblins are opposed to the Fire Giants, and I believe Lord
Nagafen (there's a room with a mural showing the goblin's plans
for attacking the dragon :). Killing them will hurt goblin
faction, and raise fire giant faction. The gnomes are from
Ak'anon, but even if you are KOS in Ak'anon, you might not be KOS
here. Killing gnomes will hurt your Ak'anon factions however, and
killing Kobolds in Solusek B will raise your faction with the
Solusek Mining Company.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Goblins</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are six &quot;clans&quot; of
goblins in Solusek, as well as three different classes. The clan
can help you determine the level or difficulty of the goblins,
and the classes determine their capabilities.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Regular goblins</strong>
        are typically warrior class, although the young goblins
        are rogues, so be careful when running from them, they
        can backstab.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Wizards</strong> are
        standard wizard type monsters, and although they have low
        hit points, they can reduce your hitpoints quickly. Too
        many wizards can make it hard to feign death as well.
        Wizards can see invis.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Shaman</strong> are
        shaman monsters, and can toss some weaker heals and buff
        other goblins as well. They can also cast spirit of the
        wolf, making the monsters run away faster. Shamans can
        see invis.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The six clans are as follows. Note
that the level ranges I have given might be incorrect, they are
only a estimate. If anyone has the correct levels for these
clans, please let me know.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Young goblins</strong>
        are the weakest clan, are around level 19-21. They can
        mostly be found right around the lavastorm entrance.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Cinder goblins</strong>
        range from 21-23, and are found in the entry area.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Flame goblins</strong>
        go from 23-25, and mostly inhabit the north area near the
        goblin captain, with some in the castle.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Fire goblins</strong>
        are 25-27, and are the toughest goblins found in the
        entry area. Most can also be found in the goblin castle.
        They also drop the Fire Goblin Totem, which is needed for
        the crafted helmet quest.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Inferno goblins</strong>,
        27-30. They are found in the goblin castle, around the
        torturer, and rarely outside. The Inferno Goblin Wizards
        also drop the Heart of Fire, which is needed for a wizard
        quest as well as ranger ivy sleeves.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Solusek goblins</strong>
        are the toughest, around 29-31. They are a little weaker
        than Shin Knights from Guk, and are guards in the goblin
        castle. They also have champions. They can be found near
        the king and high shaman. Champions drop Fiery Vambraces,
        which are needed for bard Lambent Sleeves quest.
        Firewalker boots, for bard Lambent boots quest drop on
        Solusek Mages.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Gnomes</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are two basic types of
monsters in the gnome areas. The gnomes themselves, including
Miners, Curators, and Conjurers. And the clockwork guardians
(prefix: CWG), which have 3 types and 3 levels of difficulty.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Miners</strong> are
        typical warrior mobs, ranging from level 29-33 or so.
        They seem to have low str and ac, making them pretty easy
        kills for their level.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Curators</strong> are
        cleric monsters, ranging from 30-33 or so (I have yet to
        see one cast Superior Heal). They aren't too difficult,
        but annoying because they are clerics. Even if you are
        amiable, they will heal any gnomes you are fighting,
        although they won't actually join the fight.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Conjurers</strong>
        are magician monsters. This means they almost always have
        a pet and a damage shield. If you plan to melee them,
        make sure you bring something to dispel their damage
        shield. They also nuke a little hard. And they have an
        annoying habit of damage shielding any gnomes that are
        near them or pass by them.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The clockwork guardians are called
&quot;CWG Model xx&quot; where xx is two letters. The first
letter determines the difficulty and the second letter determines
the special abilities. All clockwork guardians can see invis. For
difficulty:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>C</strong> is the
        easiest, usually level 28-30.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>M </strong>is the
        medium, 30-32.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>X</strong> is the
        hardest, 32-34.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The CWGs can also have a special
ability. You can determine this ability by the second letter:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>A</strong> is a
        regular warrior, no special abilities.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>B</strong> has a
        force module, which knocks you way back when you get hit.
        Mostly dangerous around lava, but annoying nonetheless.
        Always drops either a broken or functional force module,
        which you can sell to the vendor from 1-3pp.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>C</strong> has a
        frost module, which procs a weak cold based dd spell when
        it hits you. Not that much damage compared to a regular
        hit though. Always drops either a broken or functional
        force module, which sells to the vendor for 1-3pp.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Other notable monsters, besides
the named ones, in this dungeon include blazing elementals and a
CWG Spider. Named monsters include a kobold, an efreeti, a lava
elemental, some named gnomes and goblins, an imp, and a drake.
Because of the sheer number of monsters that can see invis, it is
suggested that you be careful when travelling through this
dungeon.</font></p>

<ol type="A" start="1">
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Window Room - </strong>This
        is the first room that you will come to when entering
        Solusek through the main entrance. If you aren't a large
        race, you can bypass most of the initial lava walkway
        here by ducking and going through the window. Large races
        get screwed here and have to go all the way around.
        Mostly young goblins up to this point.</font> </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Gnome Area </strong>-
        This is the start of the gnome area, and you'll see a few
        clockworks starting at this point. Following this path
        will take you to the back door of the gnome castle.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Gnome Castle Backdoor
        - </strong>Briefly swimming in the lava here will take
        you to an island with two drawbridges. The right one will
        take you to the gnome castle through a few gnomes (most
        of which are nice single pulls). Be careful in this area,
        as many gnomes seem to get caught up near the tip of the
        lava penninsula, and sometimes there will be 3 or 4
        gnomes in one spot.</font> </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Gnome Area - </strong>This
        area, guarded by two gnome CWGs, is the other division
        between the gnome and goblin areas. Just past the two
        guard gnomes is where the CWG Model EXG wanders to.</font>
    </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Gnome Castle Inner
        Courtyard - </strong>This room has a secret wall on the
        north side which has a switch which will open the back
        door of the gnome castle. It's a great room to pull to,
        as its outside the aggro range of all nearby gnomes. Only
        one wanderer comes through it. While there are gnomes
        above the courtyard on the upper floor, they will not
        heal or assist gnomes that you are fighting in the
        courtyard.</font> </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Gabbie's Room - </strong>Gabbie
        Mardoddle (The architect? of the Solusek Mining Company)
        spawns here, along with two other CWGs. She's one of the
        most camped monsters in Sol A. She only spawns about 20%
        of the time. Her common drop is the pet weapon, the </font><a

        casters and priest classes. She's around a level 33-34
        wizard.</font> </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Marfen's Room - </strong>The
        gnome vendor spawns here, his name is Marfen something or
        the other. Another CWG spawns in the room as well. He
        sells the <strong>Tinkerer's Pack</strong> (100% weight
        reduction, all size, 8 slots, 2.0 weight), and is useful
        to sell all the stuff you've taken off his dead gnome
        friends. I killed him once for fun, and like most
        vendors, his body disappeared. Ugh. It's interesting to
        note that Marfen is on a difference faction that Solusek
        Mining Company (probably Ak'anon merchants).</font> </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Castle Upper Level - </strong>The
        door here leads to the upper level of the castle, which
        unfortunately, is not mapped. It's a small area, with a
        few regular gnome and CWG spawns. In the room across from
        the door, there are three spawns. The one in the corner
        is a placeholder for Captain Bipnupple, a 20% rare spawn.
        He's the leader of the Solusek Mining Company, and drops
        a </font><a

        runs). Mostly he's camped by people camping Gabbie who
        are too bored of sitting in that room all day. Capt
        Bipnupple is around level 34. From the upper level, you
        can quickly drop down into the inner courtyard (<strong>E</strong>)
        or to the outer courtyard (<strong>I</strong>).</font></li>

    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Lava Elemental Room -
        </strong>I call this entire area the &quot;Museum&quot;,
        mostly cause there are usually lots of curators around
        (Ha Ha). It's the main mining area for the gnomes. Secret
        walls on all four sides of the central area open up into
        a room with a pillar of lava in the middle. There are
        five spawns in here, 4 CWGs, and a wanderer. The wanderer
        is either a CWG or 20% of the time, the Lava Elemental,
        the highest level monster in Solusek A. The lava
        elemental usually drops a potion which casts a damage
        shield on you. His rare drop is the <strong>Runed Lava
        Pendant</strong> (AC 5, STR 6, low weight), a great neck
        piece. The elemental usually has a nasty damage shield on
        him, and is around level 38. Beware that even if your
        gnome faction is good, the gnomes will assist the
        elemental unless the gnomes are much lower level than
        you. This is much like the huge elemental in lower guk.
        They will assist even if the elemental attacks you. I've
        been informed that if you swim down the lava tube in this
        room, you can get to another room. There's also a lava
        tunnel there, but as far as I know, no one has ventured
        any further down it.</font></li>

        little about the area except what I've gleaned from

        from him.</font> </li>

        Entrance- </strong>This area is the entrance to the

        It's an interesting place to visit, with lots of uncamped
        named spawns.</font></li>

    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Bats/Bugs Zone - </strong>This
        seldom used/seldom known about zone to Solusek B leads
        directly to the Bats/Bugs area of Solusek B. It's a nice
        place for high levels to hunt on that side, because you
        have this easy escape available.</font> </li>
</ol>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Suggested Hunting</u></font></h3>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">20-25 - Hunt the entry area
        for sure. Since you don't have evac yet, I'd suggest
        hunting at the Sol B zone just northwest of the lavastorm
        zone. This zone is easy to reach by just going through
        the window room, heading south, and then hanging a right
        and following the corridor. You can pull Youngs, Cinders
        and Fires from here easily, from the castle and entry
        area.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">25-30 - I'd still suggest
        hunting a zone, although I'd recommend the zones over by
        Singe and the Foreman. You can now kill some of the named
        monsters, namely Singe, the Foreman, Kindle, the Reckless
        Efreeti, the Predator. Just make sure you have a decent
        group if you are going after them. You're probably a
        little too young to solo here yet.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">30-35 - Now that you have
        evac, you can safely move in and fight much better. The
        goblin castle is a great place to hunt, and you can do
        the entry area much quicker, with a smaller group. It's
        possible to fight the gnomes now, but I'd suggest waiting
        a few more levels. If you wish to solo, the bartender
        area, or the entry area would be good. Just make sure you
        have an escape plan.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">35-40 - You can pretty much
        do the entire zone in a group now, although you'll only
        get experience from the goblin castle or the gnome
        castle. I'd suggest doing the goblin castle in a small
        group, while a full group can rake in the xp at the gnome
        castle. Solo, you should be able to do well in the goblin
        castle, and if you choose to head to the gnome castle,
        make sure you only take the lower level spawns.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">40-45 - The gnome castle is
        the only place you can get good experience, but there are
        plenty of spawns to keep you occupied. Assuming they
        aren't camped, Gabbie, Bipnupple, the EXG and the Lava
        Elemental will all give you good items. Solo is also
        great here now, especially in the gnome castle. Pull to
        either courtyard, or the corridor behind the castle.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">45-50 - Chances are, if
        you're still here, you don't care much that 60% of the
        monsters you kill are green, you just want to get some
        items. Stop camping em and camp something worthwhile in
        Kedge or something :)</font></li>
