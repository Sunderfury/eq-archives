<p><FONT size=5 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#334455"><b><u>Rants.</u></b></FONT><p><ul><FONT size=5 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a">The Epic Quest Rant</FONT></p><p><ul><FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a">I, and many others have waited along time for this, and now the Epic Quests are finally here. All the classes have their quests, and the Rogues, those wily creatures, have completed theirs already. The weapon itself is awesome, and many Rogues now queue conveyer-belt like waiting to get theirs. </p><p>CONVEYER-BELTS! That's how their quest is being done. Its like they opened a Ragebringer factory in Freeport. The servers are being flooded with them! Now, good luck to them, as the quest is a good one, involving picking pockets of some tough people, and generally sneaking around type antics in Hate, but the spawning of things like the notes to be pickpocketed are happening every 3 to 30mins! 30 minutes tops to get the note, and 8 hours for the Hate note. Which in theory means 3 Ragebringers a day!</p><p>Right, lets move on to another of the class epic quests, the Magician quest. Finding the man in FV was easy, he wanders around the cliffs.</p><p><i>You say, 'hail Tiblner Milnik'</i></p><p><i>Tiblner Milnik says 'Huh?  What?  Oh, you speak so fast, it took me a moment.   I have become used to the slow and stately conversation the Earth holds, where a thought can span aeons.  I am the Master of Earth, you know.  Though I'm usually too humble to say this, that makes me the most powerful mortal in Norrath, as everyone knows that Earth is the only REAL Element, all else must give way before its power.  Water is absorbed by it, Air is ignored by it, and Fire is contained in it.   But you know all these things, I am sure.  Are you interested in obtaining the Element of Earth?  I know Magi'kot was, but we know what happened to him, don't we? </i></p><p><i>You say, 'I am intrested in obtaining the Element of Earth'</i></p><p><i>Tiblner Milnik says 'Combining the following items can bring the Element of Earth together.  Obtain the Staff of Elemental Mastery:Earth, held by the minions of the Prince of Hate, The Dirt of Underfoot found on Slix something or the other, and of course, I shall need the Broom of Trilon and the Shovel of Ponz.  Bring all these things, and I shall show you what a true Master of Earth can do, and gift you with the Element of Earth. </i></p><p>Straightforward, no mucking about, instant recognition as a Mage quest, and so the little mage, full of knowledge, rushes to find the components this man needs, so that he can move on to the next well detailed part of the quest.</p><p><STRONG>Monk Quest.</STRONG></P><p>There is an Erudite called Tomemaster Dahl. When hailed, he says:</p><p><i>Tomekeeper Danl says 'Good day, citizen. Please remember to keep your voice down in our library. Feel free to browse the extensive collection of books we have on display. Learning is all about you and our library is the greatest collection of educational literature in the world, as you can no doubt see. However, there are a few books we do not own and we are prepared to pay well to acquire [rare finds].</i></p><p><i>'What rare finds?'</i></p><p><i>Tomekeeper Danl says 'Yes, any rare books, tomes, essays, or other literature you find may be of interested to me. Although the finds I am interested in are quite high profile and would most likely only be found in the possession of very powerful or influential beings. Give me what you have found and I will pay you what it is worth to us.</i></p><p>What? WTF has this to do with Monks? WTF has it to do with Erudites? WTF has it to do with any class specific quest? It could be for anything. ANY BOOK IN NORRATH! No amount of badgering this man prompts him that you need the book of Immortals, other than Clairvoyance! Please take the time to read the difference between the two again. Actually, this is what the Monk version of the Mage one would look like.</p><p><i>You say, 'hail Tiblner Milnik'</i></p><p><i>Tiblner Milnik says 'Huh?  What?  Oh, you speak so fast, it took me a moment.   I have become used to the slow and stately conversation.</i></p><p>From that, the OBVIOUS step, (well as obvious as the book of Immortals being the right book), is to ask him:</p><p><i>You say, 'I am intrested in Earth'</i></p><p><i>Tiblner Milnik says 'Combining the following items can bring the Earth together.  Obtain a Stick, oh and some Dirt. </i></p><p>Bingo, the person, is completely clueless. No class definitive speech, no real clue that this is anything other than an old elf who wants a stick and some dirt. What dirt and stick is up to you, the player, to needlessly spend time and effort over in trying to get the right combination, and they probably wouldn't bother anyway, as the player has not been hooked into performing a specific task.</p><p>Back to the Monks, who against all of 'Verants cunning plans', have discovered the book required.</p><p><i>Tomekeeper Danl gasps at the sight of the rare book and says, 'This is a great find indeed! I can only imagine who you had to.. persuade to give you the book. Our library would be very interested in acquiring this and I am prepared to give you this platinum and a referral that marks you as a friend of the library. If only [Lheao] could see this.'</i></p><p>Now Lheao turns out to be another idiot. He, even when given the seal that you get from Dahl, more or less ignores you, asking only for proof of mastery. Mastery of what? I am a Master Alcoholic, does he want to join in with me on a piss up? Watch my swimming skills? Bake him a cake? No, the bugger wants your robe. You know the robe Im talking about, the one YOU spent days, weeks, months on, not only camping rare spawns, but CAMPING THE NPC'S WHO GAVE YOU THE QUEST IN THE FIRST PLACE! Also, it must be the Whistling Fist robe, which requires deep penetration into dark dungeons.</p><p>Now, after that great sacrifice, what does he do? Congratulate you, and give you a book of the Celestial Fists. Which has not only had coffee or something spilled on it, but been defaced with 'sex organs' as any normal teenager with a book with pictures in does. Its illegible. Not only that, but he tells you to not let it fall into the wrong hands. Who's hands are wrong? Where do I go?  Why have you drawn knobs on Trorsmang? THERE ARE NO MORE CLUES! I feel that the Monks who have bothered to get that far, with no storyline, no pace, no direction, feel that they have wandered into a spy movie, that not only has been translated from Polish to Arabic and back again, but is also HALF WAY THROUGH! </p><p>Next up we have Kaiaren, yet another waste of space NPC, who regardless of what you wear, wants you to 'get it away from him'. He doesn't tell you what 'it' is, and even when the 'it' has been presumed to be the CF book, he attacks you, forcing you to kill him before you can ask him any questions!</p><p>This whole quest so far smacks of the clues given in the gameshow '321'. For those Americans who do not know the show, ask a Brit over 25, just how bad it was. </p><p>Anyway, I'm off now to look for some dirt and a stick.
