      originates in the zone of Skyshrine, with a NPC called Sentry Kale. As
      with all of Skyshrine, he is on Claws of Veeshan faction, but even if KOS,
      a Monk can iniate this quest by the use of Sneak and Feign Death.<BR>
       <BR> Sentry Kale has 3 Quests, the <A HREF="hammerfalquest.htm">Bracer of
        Hammerfal</A>, a spider related one, and the Dragon Tooth Choker.He does
      not despawn/respawn, and the only way to get the quest you require is by
      killing him or waiting for server resets. He is roughly on a 30 min timer.</FONT></P>

        in the house in Kael Drakkal as marked, in the very last room. The first
        room of the house contains 5 Giants, made up from lesser Storm Giant
        nobles and other named Giants, and the second room contains Wenglawks
        Kkeak as well as Noble Helssen who is a caster. </FONT><BR>

        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Wenglawks is on a seperate faction to the
        giants, so if spoken too will communicate with you, however if aggrod by
        any of the other giants, he will attack.<BR>

    </TABLE>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">The best way
      to get to speak to Wenglawks, is to get an invis, sneak and hide behind
      Wenglawks, and then trade before Noble Helssen blasts you (who will then
      aggro Wenglawks). Or, if like me you cannot get this to work, you can try
      the harder way, which is to sneak into the room behind Noble Helssen,
      stand level with Helsson (opposite Wenglawks) and inch forward until you
      can trade with him. I have now succesfully sneaked in and out of the house
      many times, without being hit once.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">Wenglawks is
      also rumoured to wander from the house, and up the path deeper into Kael,
      but I waited outside on the ramp for more than 30 mins (and on seperate
      occasions) and did not see him move once.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000"><B>Note:</B>
      For the run into Wenglawks house (if you cannot get the sneak method to
      work), it is highly reccomended that you are SoW'd, and preferably be 51st
      level to have Stonestance available to you, as the giants, if things go
      pear shaped, hit hard and fast. A few times, with over 1500hps, I limped
      out of that room with 150 hits. Helsson can chain cast a nasty nuke, and
      if the merchant in the first room is aggrod somehow, he hits in the 300's.
      Other tricks include waiting until Helssen begins to cast a spell on
      himself or Wenglawks, then running for a safe spot.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">When iniating
      trade with Wenglawks, it has been noted that it is best to give the coin
      first, as it has been reported that he will not aggro if the money is the
      first thing in the trade window. Follow this up with the note, and the
      trade will be completed (and then Wenglawks will attack if you aggrod
      Helssen or anyone else.)<BR>
       <BR><B>I can now confirm that the 100pp is not actually required, and that
      you can hand in the note without any coin, and still recieve the
      dispelling device.</B></FONT></P>
