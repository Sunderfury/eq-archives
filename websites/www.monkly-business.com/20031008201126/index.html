<p>
<ul>
Gamers' worst fears were confirmed this morning when Vivendi Universal announced that its eagerly awaited Half-Life 2 will not be released until April 2004. 
</p>
<p>
In a brief statement to the French daily Les Echos, VU Games president of international operations, Christophe Ramboz, blamed the now-infamous source code theft for the delay. "A third of the source code was stolen," said Ramboz. "It's serious because it forces us to delay the launch of the game by at least four months--to April 2004." Neither Half-Life 2's developer, Valve Software (site of the actual code theft), nor its founder, Gabe Newell, had any comments as of press time. A Vivendi Universal Games spokesperson informed GameSpot that it would release a statement regarding the game later today.

<p>
An upcoming conference at New York Law School will see game designers and entrepreneurs, legal scholars and practitioners exploring the phenomenon of massively multiplayer games and the virtual worlds that they create. The State of Play: Law, Games, and Virtual Worlds conference will take place on November 13 through 15, and is being sponsored by the Institute for Information Law and Policy at New York Law School, and the Information Society Project at Yale Law School. 
</p>
<p>
Topics up for debate at the conference will include what happens when real-world law and virtual world creativity collide; the legal, political, and cultural issues that confront players in virtual societies; and what virtual communities might be able to teach us about governing our own. 
</p>
<p>

That is right the Oakland Athletics...LOST AGAIN to extend their "clinching game" losing streak to 9.
</p>
<p>
Which means...

<p>
<B> THE RED SOX WIN.....THE RED SOX WIN...</B>
</p>
<p>
Seriously though this was one of the Best Series I have seen with 5 UNBELIEVABLY well pitched games. the pitching by BOTH teams was outstanding. and Johnny Damon is going to be fine- just a concussion (atleast that is what the news is saying).

From Dev Corner:
</p>
<p>
As of our update on October 9th, the Solid Coal of Prowess, Blook Ruby of Understanding, and Ooze-Covered Pebble of Perfection will no longer be valid augmentations.  If you had these augmentations bonded to an item, you will find them on your cursor.  You can take those items to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.
</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE:  You MUST have some open inventory space to hold these items!  Also, if you zone with those items on your cursor, they will disappear.  So when you log in before the update, make sure you have some free space in your inventory.  And when you log in after the update, make certain to get those items off your cursor and into your inventory.
</p>
<p>

This change is happening due to an issue with some of the new LDoN items.  These three augmentations will be replaced with three similar augmentations that fit into slot 7 or 8.  Along with that, pre-LDoN items that were given slot type 1 will now have slot type 7.
</p>
<p>
Essentially, this will mean no change for those with these augmentations in their pre-LDoN items.  It will, however, restrict the use of multiples of these augmentations on LDoN items.  We apologize for the changes, but these items needed to be more restricted to help maintain game balance.

In one of the Wackier games I have ever seen saturday, Red Sox stayed alive, sunday, was even Better... now here is hoping Oakland can keep their Streak ALIVE... (they are 0 for the millenium(2000 actually is when the streak started) in "clinching" games in the playoffs) 
</p>
<p>
Luckily for me, I am a Boston Red Sox Fan. now if MLB's dream comes true, it will be the Red Sox vs the Cubs....

You heard it right HL2's source code was stolen and leaked to the net by some nefarious person using a custom made keystroke trojan. It has been confirmed by valve that it is the code, they are actively hunting down this person who did it. the Problem occured most likely Via an exploit in ...outlook since the person who confirmed it said they have been getting periodic DNS attacks at valve and tracking their email, they have had SEVERAL instances where...someone else was using HIS email account to access the computers.
