<p>
There are indeed a few quests actually handled by bankers. Because bankers can no longer accept items, those quests can't be completed. We hope to have those specific quests addressed soon.

Sorry for the problem.

From Gamespot:
</p>
<p>
Blizzard has announced that the development schedule for Starcraft: Ghost has been extended past the end of the 2003 to meet the team's goals and "deliver the outstanding gameplay experience our customers have come to expect from Blizzard products." The game is now scheduled for 2004, and Blizzard says it believes "that this additional development time will prove invaluable, ensuring that the game will truly expand on the legendary gameplay experience found in the previous Starcraft titles." The Blizzard statement further said that the developer "will not release the game until it's ready."

The Shared Bank slot that is/was on test  is on hold until they get the item vanishing bug worked out. shouldn't take them too long to fix it - heck it might be fixed already.

Ebworld has the next expansion of EQ named - yup you guessed it- Lost Dungeons of Norrath. Sony also has lostdungeonsofnorrath.com registered now, they didn't before. 
</p>
<p>
There is a Rumor around that they will implement "instancing" for the higher level dungeons and content so that the main complaint that players have is a lack of spawn due to competition. Instancing is you have a dungeon you enter, everyone in your "raid" goes into the dungeon. if raid number 2 enters the dungeon, they have a whole NEW zone to enter - one without raid 1. i know for a fact they are planning on eq2 having instancing, so i bet it being in LDoN will be the "beta" testing for it. people start logging onto test fairly often, hopefully SoE will use the test server community to test LDoN.

LucasArts confirms that the previously announced console versions of the Star Wars online RPG are currently on hold, as all development efforts are focused on the PC launch.
</p>
<p>
At E3 2002, LucasArts announced that it planned to release Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, its highly anticipated online RPG set in the Star Wars universe, for the Xbox and PlayStation 2. However, mention of these versions was recently removed from the publisher's Web page on the game, and LucasArts has confirmed for us that these versions are currently on hold. In a brief statement, LucasArts said, "We are currently focusing all of our efforts on the successful launch of the PC version of Star Wars Galaxies."

For the few that Didn't know the Paladin AA Act of Valor was Bugged. For an unrezzable death you could save 1 person by the xfer of all your hp and -coincidentally - Crash the zone you were in. Its amazing how fast this got fixed once the word got out that it was bugged like this.(2-3 days)
</p>
<p>
Here is your patch message(even though its the 22nd):

<i>

<p>
** Paladin AA Act of Valor **
</p>
<p>
Fixed a problem with Act of Valor.  Use of this AA ability was causing zones to crash.  That shouldn't happen any more.
</i>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Now if they only would fix the monk AA Return kick - which has NOT worked correctly since Luclin's release, fix the Book in Great Divide during a ring war, Fix Beastlord pets in the plane of sky, and Fix the Bot tower bosses to actually drop Loot.

Various Ramblings about some IRL things. hope you find them as interesting as i did

<p>
The Matrix Reloaded grossed 93.3 million over the weekend making it the movie with the best opening ever by an R rated movie (beating hannibal the old winner by 35 million) and placing it 2nd to Spiderman for best release by a movie. It has also sparked heated debate on the plot.
</p>
<p>
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is due out june 21st and will be an instant best seller with over 875 thousand preorders from Amazon.com and its affiliates world wide.

<p>
Battlestar Galactica is coming to SCI-Fi in a 4hr mini-series/Pilot in December. new graphics, new cylons and - get this- a FEMALE Starbuck(who reportedly acts almost exactly like the original starbuck(my favorite char from the series)).

in Gaming News
</p>
<p>
From CNN: The state of Washington has become the first in the nation to regulate the sale of video games. Gov. Gary Locke on Monday signed into law a bill banning the sale of certain 'violent' games to anyone under 17. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the law forbids selling minors any video or computer game depicting violence against law enforcement officials. Among the titles affected are industry best sellers "Grand Theft Auto 3" and "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City", both published by Take Two Interactive (TTWO: Research, Estimates). Presumably, Atari's (ATAR: Research, Estimates) $30 million "Enter the Matrix", which hit store shelves last Thursday, would also be off limits to its core audience. That title earned only a "Teen" rating, since it is not graphically violent, though police officers are in-game enemies. 
</p>
<p>
Retail employees who sell these games to minors are subject to fines of up to $500. 
</p>
<p>
The Interactive Digital Software Association (the gaming industry trade group) denounced the bill, calling it unconstitutional and announced plans to file a lawsuit, which it hopes will prevent the law from being enforced. 
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Galaxies release rumors Abound saying June 24th...with the NDA still not lifted, i don't think this will happen but they are in HEAVY fixing mode right now so it is possible. and i am having fun playing - i'll have a "forming your character" little tidbit when the nda is lifted.

That is about all for now
