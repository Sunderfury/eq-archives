As you may or may not know there is a quest given by Grimror Plaguebringer to give you an alternate means of entering the Crypt of Decay. 
</p>
<p>
Once Completeing the quest- you apparently cannot get flagged by the flag spawn in order to be able to get your flag to kill bertox, you STILL need to have killed Grummus/hailed that apparition(if there is one-i don't know have not fought Grummus yet)in order to progress further along the story line/advance further in PoP. 
</p>
<p>
Unless this changes, if you miss out on your Grummus killing you currently are S.O.L. on bertox. the question is:
</p>
<p>
Is the Alternate Entry Quest for Halls of Honor similar to this in that the person doing the quest cannot get the necessary flags? 
</p>
<p>
The other question is...Is Verant/SoE going to change this so that people doing these alternate entry quests can progress further/catch up to their guildmates.

I have unconfirmed- at this time - reports(ie I got an email about a paladin post saying its fixed- thanks Jared) that either the Dec 4th patch or the Dec 5th patch Fixed the loot table for Yelinak - ie he is dropping both the head and the talisman again. IF anyone else can confirm that he drops those items again please email me about it so that we can verify this information.
</p>
<p>
Now the question is did my dialogue with Absor and the news I posted about Yelinak help get it fixed faster or not, we'll never know.....

Funny they are patching recently more than they did on release of Planes of Power... Wonder what changes will go in this patch. Stay tuned for the latest Information.
</p>
<p>
On Wednesday, December 11th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 3 hours. The

          Submitted by <a href="mailto:lenardo@monkly-business.com">Lenardo</a> on 12/7/2002 1:05:33 AM</p>
        <ul>
          <p class="MB_Body"><p>
Planes of Power has a problem. a major problem.
</p>
<p>
It is about Spawn, especially FLAG spawn. When the servers crash or come down for a patch, EVERY SINGLE FLAG spawn is up when the servers come back and are ready to be activated/triggered or killed.
</p>
<p>
What does this mean?
</p>
<p>
For the average casual player, not much, BUT to the RAID player, this means quite alot. 
</p>
<p>
Currently on Alot of servers, the high end Raid guilds that play based on US primetime for those servers are...
</p>
<p>
STUCK 
</p>
<p>
Not from failing to kill the spawn and blowing that chance, but for the spawn being killed/blown/activated in the early morning on serverups prior to these guilds being able to play. 
</p>
<p>
These people work and have jobs, while their evening activites are EQ centric. With the current situation as it is, these guilds and the players in them have no shot at spawn so they can progress further into the planes of power due to guilds on Asian and European play times, hogging the content. 
</p>
<p>
WHAT can be done?
</p>
<p>
Simple Solution - Put ALL Flag centric spawn on the Random Serverup timers so that the US based guilds have more of a chance to do the content that is being currently monopolized by the Asian and European guilds.
</p>
<p>
The trials at Halls of Honor Activation Spawn needs to be Tweaked.
</p>
<p>
Currently ANYONE can say the correct phrase in Halls of Honor to activate the trial, if you fail the trial it takes 3 days to reset.
</p>
<p>
People that have no chance of winning are blowing this event, and preventing the guilds that have a legitimate shot at winning, out of the picture unless they get lucky 3 days later. The blood in SSRA respawns on a failed Emperor attempt approxiamately 8hrs after the failed attempt. The Activation spawn for the Halls of Honor trial should be done in a similar fashion.
</p>
<p>
The Bastion of Thunder Quest has been Greatly enhanced to allow more players to finish this in a timely manner. Thank you Verant/SoE for fixing this once painful bottle neck.
</p>
<p>
Thanks go out to the monks from the raid guilds on the nameless for mentioning this to me several times which prompted me to post this, and from Guildsites around EQ that have been complaining about this problem with Planes of Power - one of the few complaints there has been.

Since its a Slow news day for EQ i thought i'd post some information about the upcoming MMOG Star War:Galaxies.
</p>
<p>
In a Recent Announcment(21.05.2002) The Developers of SW:G have announced that the current plan for ALL servers are to be Single Character Galaxies(servers) with a limit of 10 characters per account.
</p>
<p>
The Community for SW:G is up in arms waging posting wars either praising the announcements or denouncing it as sheer idiocy. 
</p>
<p>
My Personal opinion. I would prefer SW:G to have multiple character galaxies. i'm fine with the limit of 10 characters per account but i would PREFER to be able to have more than 1 character on the same server without resorting to buying a new account.
</p>
<p>
The other Big News for SW:G is the fact that the Jedi Profession is going to be pvp active if they use their powers for a short amount of time. This should add alot of suspense to those lucky few that become Jedi.

Sorry Shadow Knights - Mental Corruption is fixed now i HOPE you enjoyed your 100% mana  spell yesterday - for those that didn't know instead of returning 100 mana, the spell returned 100% mana on process thus most SK's were going hogwild casting and NEVER running out of mana.

In speaking via email with Absor(Alan Vancouvering) today, there currently is no timetable on when the revised mitigation change is going to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
Absor told me today that he has been pestering the development team on this and several other issues - like Yelinak's Loot Table, which is the other thing i asked him about - for a while and is about to pester them again on it, stay tuned, i've asked him to keep me informed of any further developments.
</p>

Also with Zadkiel Leaving, I am taking over the everyday running of this site. I'm in charge of the news and the administration w/bodi of the messageboards.

Go easy on us ok?

Looks like they have not Yet fixed Yelinak's Loot table for the 2 quest items -that are still asked for by the quest originators, of course there is a slim chance they forgot to mention it, but I doubt that. IF they have please email me the information so i can correctly announce that he is fixed.
</p>
<p>

<i>
** Zones **
</p>
<p>
- Updated the sage quests in the Plane of Knowledge.<br>
- Addressed several bugs with the Rallos Zek encounter.<br>
- Vallon Zek's script should now work correctly.<br>
</p>
<p>
** Spells **
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug with lull and harmony type spells that could cause zone-wide agro.
</p>
<p>
- Reduced the fizzle rate on Beastlord spells to match that of all other hybrid classes.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug that was allowing some charmed NPCs to break mez.
</p>
<p>
- Blinding spells will now affect characters on horseback.
</p>
<p>
- Spells that automatically target your pet will now work (on your regular pet) when you have a Servant of Ro.
</p>
<p>
- You should be able to heal and buff your regular pet when using Host of Elements or Wake the Dead.
</p>
<p>
- Eldritch rune should now absorb more damage
</p>
<p>
- The last patch changes to Mental Corruption made it too powerful for a level 52 spell.  The damage has been toned down, and the mana recourse has been changed to scale from level 52 to 60
</p>
<p>
** Music Player **
</p>
<p>
- Typing /mp3 with no arguments will now bring up the Music Player.
</p>
<p>
- When saving play lists, the player will automatically remove any extension on the filename entered and replace it with .m3u.  Since only files with the .m3u extension can be loaded as playlists by the Music Player, this should remove some "can't load a list I just saved" issues.
</p>
<p>
** Miscellaneous **
</p>
<p>
If you are working to explore Planes of Power without progressing through the storyline, you may find that the alternate methods to enter some zones now goes a little bit faster.
