              <p>I know there's already a thread based on PvP in the Guides section, but I've been wanting to write one based on my perspective for a long time so here goes.. 

<p> <b> Jousting</b>

<p> Someone posted that they don't joust warriors in PvP, and circle strafe around them instead. Unfortunately, this will not work on most warriors unless you have a speed advantage over them - no one is going to stand still and spin around while you work over them with your 1handers. Most warriors/hybrids I've fought have a high DMG 2h weapon handy and unless you have SoW and they don't, you have to joust them. Best strategy to use when jousting, it to strafe to the right or left right before passing your opponent, and quickly hit him with FK/autoattack/disarm. If all else fails go on the defensive, make your opponent charge you and use the strafing-joust technique. Try to make your jousting patterns unpredictable, rather than just blindly charging your opponent over and over. 

<p> <i> Fighting specific classes with a Monk</i>

<p> <b> Warriors & Paladins</b>

<p> These guys have more HP and sometimes more AC than you, and have a lot of high damage 2h weps available to them. A fight with them will be largely dependant on your skill in jousting. Most fights with warriors I've had have been pretty close, remember to always use flying kick when jousting and use mend as soon as you get below 70% HP. The longer the fight takes, the better chance you have of winning because mend will eventually give you the advantage. If you're fighting a 55+ warrior and they decide to try their Mighty Strike discipline on you, get your highest damage weapon out and use Whirlwind to counter it. Same tactics apply to fighting a Paladin, but be sure to pumice the Paladin as soon as you can (cancelling their HP buffs can knock off a lot of HP & AC) and make them lay hands asap so you can retreat if you are losing and effectively waste their LH. Also a good idea to wear some MR gear.

<p> <b> Shadowknights</b>

<p> SK's are a bitch, plain and simple. You need the following when going up against a SK: over 80 MR, a see invis item, pumice stone(s). If they land a darkness on you, you can pretty much consider the fight over - so wear some MR gear but don't sacrifice too much AC/HP for it. I've never fought a SK who used his pet when fighting me, most seem to favor using a pre-nerf CoS which can be deadly if you don't have a see-invis item on. Fight them like a warrior, but watch out for Harm Touch. Sometimes its best not to use Mend as soon as you get below 70% HP when fighting a SK, wait for them to HT instead.. but not too long to where the HT will outright kill you. If you can't win the fight after they hit you with Harm Touch, retreat and come back to a much easier fight. Don't let the SK get too far away from you, you don't want them getting distance on you and hitting you with DoT's or what not. Its also good to have a fast 1h weapon available to interupt them.

<p> <b> Rogues</b> 

<p> Fight them like a warrior, don't let them get behind your back. Wear a see-invis item, otherwise they're going to pelt you with backstabs and/or poison. Don't joust them straight up, good rogues know how to do a foward-backstab, so try to get on the side of them. Also, take your time when fighting a rogue, don't attempt going toe-to-toe with them. The best jousting peircer a rogue gets is 15 damage. 

<p> <b> Bards</b>

<p> First of all, put on all your FR/CR/MR resist gear.. Next, target the Bard, now if you are fighting in an indoor area, proceed to kicking the Bard's ass. Outdoors are a lot different, best thing to do is to /laugh at the Bard and either a) zone or b) camp. No MR/CR/FR? You'll get owned. And nothng sucks more than getting owned by a Bard, so get good resists because you aren't going to catch them outdoors ... they get a non-interuptable faster than SoW song, a shadowstep song, a snare song, to list a few. 

<p> <b> Enchanters & Wizards</b>

<p> When fighting a chanter, sacrifice all AC/HP/whatever for MR. Tashania takes off well over 50 MR. No MR? You are dead. Very good MR? Should be an easy victory. Same thing applies to Wizards, except you need FR and CR too. For both classes a fast 1h will work best for killing them. Pumice stones also do some good to get rid of lev/shielding/etc. Wizards and Chanters do not have shit for HP or AC, stick to them and don't let them get any spells off. Again, if your MR sucks these guys will own you. 

<p> <b> Druids</b>

<p> You need: A LOT of pumice stones, very high MR & FR, fast weapon. Start off the fight by using your pumice stone untill SoW/thorns drop. Winged Death is not nerfed in PvP, and it also stacks with the 44 Druid DoT Drifting Death. Fortunately, most Druids are dumb and do not know this. These DoTs are also basically unresistable, if one lands on you (esp. WD) pumice it immediately. The key to killing a Druid is to not let them land their DoTs, stick to them as close as you can. Having good FR helps a lot too, since all of their nukes are fire based and they can debuff your FR. A Druid with his SoW/levitate/thorns buried deep below other buffs, who knows how to play his class can be a nightmare for a Monk. Don't let them get out of melee range.

<p> <b> Necros & Magicians</b>

<p> Jboots are your best friend when fighting a Mage or Necro. A SoW'd pet will most likely mean death for you though, so either ID it off or find a way to pumice it. When fighting a Magician you need FR, for Necros MR DR and PR. Both of these classes are tough for a Monk, you need to interupt the Caster, but also prevent the pet from kicking your ass. If a Necro's Darkness lands you are dead. If a SoW'd Mage & Pet get the jump on you, you are probably dead too. Most necros do not use a SoW potion on their pet, so just fight the Necro just as you would a Wizard and don't worry about the pet. If a Splurt or Boil Blood line lands on you, get rid of it immediately. Unfortunately, most Magicians have SoW'd pets (they get a pet SoW spell) and their pets do a lot of damage. So do your best to ID the pet and then take out the Mage.

<p> <b> Shamans</b>

<p> First, look at the Shaman's boots. Are they black? If so, you cannot kill that Shaman, he has Instant-cast SoW boots. Most likely, his pet will have SoW too. Shaman pets do not do much damage, you don't really have to worry about them. If you find they are hitting you more than they should, take them out they don't have near as many HP as a Mage or Necro pet. You need: Pumice stone, lots of MR PR DR CR, fast weapon. Killing a shaman w/o epic boots is all about having good resists. If ebolt and/or plague lands on you, its over. Fight them like you would a Druid. 

<p> <b> Rangers & Clerics</b>

<p> Notice how I put Rangers and Clerics together? Thats because they both kinda suck. When fighting a Cleric just put on all your MR gear and beat him down. It should be an easy victory. Rangers don't really suck as much as some people think they do, they are basicially a Warrior with 2/3 the HP, -150AC or so that can snare/SoW and have some decent buffs. Start off the fight by getting rid of all their buffs, and then treat them like a Warrior. A Ranger with Trueshot disc. can really kick your ass.... so watch out for that if you are fighting a high level Ranger. You need good MR when going up against either a Cleric or a Ranger. 

<p> <i> Things to remember when PK'ing on a PVP Server</i>

<p> Most fights occur when you don't expect them to, so its a good idea to keep at least some resist gear on at all times. #1 factor in whether you win a fight is whether you find your opponent, or if he finds you. 
Its also a good idea to have
<br>1.) Jboots or SoW potions
<br>2.) A fast weapon
<br>3.) A high damage weapon
<br>4.) Pumice Stones (19pp at many vendors, 5 charge nullify magic)
<br>5.) Good resist gear

<p> Damn this post is a lot longer than I planned on it being, and there's still several things I haven't covered. Will revise this in the near future.. if anyone wants to add anything on to what I've said feel free to.
