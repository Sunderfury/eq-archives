                <P>How to get your very own OS Key
    
    <p>Old Sebilis
      requires a "key" to enter. While many of you may have it, this
      guide is for those who forgot how, or haven't yet received theirs. The "key"
      is actually called "Trakanon Idol" and appears to be a monkey,
      like the goblin fire totem. It is soul-bound, so when you die, you will
      still have on corpse. The quest is in Trakanon's Teeth, given by Emperor
      Ganak, as seen to the right. Trakanon's Teeth is a medium sized zone, and
      here is a map of what it looks like: 

   
    
    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/eqbodi/images/mb_ttmap.jpg" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="330"></P>
    <TABLE border="1" cellspacing="0">
      <TR>
        <TD><IMG SRC="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/monsterpics/emperor_ganak.jpg"></TD>
        <TD>
        To find Emperor Ganak, you must travel through dangerous land, many
        things like frogloks, trakaraptors, and undead keepers see through
        invisibility, making traveling dangerous, many can dot, snare, or fear
        you. If you are under level 45 I would take caution through this region.
        As you can see, the emperor can be found by following the wall to your
        right from either zone in. <br><br>He is in the building at the cemetery,
        unfortunately all the ghosts see regular invisibility, so either have
        sow and try to run fast enough to move in and out of aggro range, or use
        IU to get into his room. He is on the RIGHT stairs going in.. the other
        is a dead end. Ok now that you found the guy, you are probably wondering
        what to do to get the key. Well Hail him and ask:
        </TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
<p><I>You say, 'what
        medallions?'. Emperor Ganak says 'There were five different tribes of my
        people. The Kunzar, Kylong, Nathsar, Obulus, and Jarsath. Each of these
        tribes had a medallion that represented it. If you can return to me the
        Medallion of the Kunzar and Nathsar, I will give you the idol of
        Trakanon.' </I>Now to find these medallions.
    <p>The
      medallions are found off two frogloks in the zone, a froglok hunter, and a
      froglok forager. Both are level 45, hit for over 100, sometimes triples
      hit. No odd resistances, easy to land snare/fear/dd's/stuns, etc. The only
      problem with these, is that they run fast, sow can keep you ahead, but if
      you run too fast, they will lose interest and stop following, and once
      that happens, finding them may be difficult, they tend to warp back to
      where they were and take off. On the map you will see the darker green
      areas, the Forager and Hunter spawns in those areas, the forager a is
      where he is for the first few minutes, but if you wait too long, he tends
      to warp near OS entrance at the Forager B area. You will need a good
      tracker to find him once he goes over there, trying to pull him back to
      camp with many mobs around is very difficult especially since they lose
      interest easily. Here are the pictures of your opponents.</P>
    
    <P><IMG SRC="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/monsterpics/froglok_hunter.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="250"><IMG SRC="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/monsterpics/froglok_forager_tt.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="250"></P>
    
    <P>If you plan
      on killing these, you will need a good tracker. They move fast and
      trackers can get aggro'd from many things, and soon will have a train. A
      bard, ranger, or druid work well here since the new tracking change
      (before druids had too small of area to track effectively), as long as the
      bard/druid move close to spawn areas, you should get them on track. The
      frogs respawn instantly when they, or their rare, dies. If you see a named
      up, you may have to kill it to make one of these spawn. Each of these have
      their own rares, some with ok loot some with nothing.. if you plan on
      taking out these rares, make sure you have a good group, some ht and cast
      dd's. My suggestion is to go with a tracker, and find out if you need help
      getting one of the rares killed. Also, many times there will be a group
      killing these for the rares to spawn, in which case a friendly tell asking
      to loot the medallion will usually get you the pieces. In addition to the
      medallions, they drop <A HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2670">Spectral
        Bow</A> most of the time.
      Not a bad bow for pulling warriors.</P>
    
    <P>There are
      really 3 nice spots to camp(some camp near the wall but find sometimes
      hunter won't appear on track), marked by X's on the map. The EJ zone is a
      good spot to hunt for the hunter, he spawns nearest to there, and then
      moving to swamp cave gives you a nice place where no mobs wander to. The "best"
      spot I would say is the waterfall, rarely one mob does wander close enough
      to aggro, but from there you can track all the spawn areas. Once these 2
      are killed, take their medallions back to Emperor Ganak, and he will give
      you some xp and the Trakanon Idol.</P>

      <IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/eqbodi/images/mb_trakanonidol.gif" WIDTH="308" HEIGHT="123"></P>
    
    <P>A monk and
      druid would work well with snare and ID hitting, otherwise slow is very
      useful, so an enc or shaman would be helpful in trying to kill these. I
      would tend to go with more if you are thinking of getting the rares for a
      noose or med blanket, both nice monk items.</P>
