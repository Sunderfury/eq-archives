    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The 32nd Circle is spent
      mostly travelling backwards and forwards to the Giants within the woods,
      and the Brutes outside of Dalnir. I finally get the Crescent Gi I am
      after, and also pick up a Drolvarg Mantle from someone selling it in FV.
      The later half of the time is spent fighting at the Sarnak fortress, near
      the tooth bridge, and actually on top of the entrance, and within the
      spires.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Still at the Sarnaks for
      33rd, I eventually see a larger Sarnak, one with a pet, and foolishly
      engage him, and suffer the consiquences of being feared while having 8 of
      its friends beat me to death. Got myself a Vox Bracer, and fought
      (breifly) within the Frontier Mountains. I say breifly, as I grouped with
      Doyle to hunt the tougher Giants, and then we are both jumped and killed
      by a Goblin caster. Decide that the Sarnaks are far better game, and
      finish 33 there.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Frontier Mountains was still
      to hard for me to hunt at 34, and the Sarnaks where beginning to be more
      wary of me, so I decided to head home to Freeport. Here I completed the
      Red Sash quest for my guildmasters, and topped Ohmigosh up with BI armour,
      as his goods had rotted. Returned to SK, and found that the toughest of
      the warrior Aviaks, and the Gnolls, where huntable. I followed Brother
      Qwinn around for a while, as I know this brother can be hard to find, and
      have noted his path. I only hope that when I come to do the quest for the
      <A HREF="robequest.htm">Robe of the Lost Circle</A>, I can find him
      again. I grouped within Paw, and these Gnolls are far tougher than the
      previous inhabitants, and then I travelled to the Rathe Mountains. Here, I
      fought Giant Skeletons, and even tried a Cyclops, but was beaten badly, so
      had to feign. My skill in feign death, caused me to carry on trying
      against Cyclops and even Hill Giants, and only when sufficiently beaten
      did it sink in to leave them alone.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">35th saw the last of my
      skills, that of Riposte, and going back to Kunark, it was tested with FM
      on brutes. Not learning my lesson about the perils of Dalnir, I return,
      and my efforts of getting a Fighting Baton fail, and after dying again, I
      return to FM. The baton's call is seductive however, and it is not long
      before I am back there again, and again I am unsuccesful. Eventually, I am
      put out of my misery by brother Goju, who presents me with one as a gift.
      It is not long however before word of a new Monk weapon is discovered,
      Master Wu's trance Stick, found in the City of Mist. I travelled there,
      and fought long and hard, but did not see sign of this fabled weapon. My
      <A HREF="cityofmist.htm">adventures</A> there are chronicled seperatly,
      as there was much to be said.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">For the 36th Circle,
      wanderlust was upon me again, and after travelling to the Dreadlands, then
      to the City of Mist, I went back to Freeport, and to a dungeon known as
      Sol A, where Fire Goblins dwelt. I intended to hunt for treasure here, but
      ended up being backstabbed by the sneaky goblins (OOC for a 180 damage!) I
      return to Kunark, and find that now the FM are huntable, and quickly raise
      my skills to the next circle.</FONT> </P>

        then moved on to the other side of FV, near the cliffs and temple area.
        Here I hunted Pirates, which came in all races, and Drolvargs, savages
        and scavengers. This place was so good to hunt, that I wrote a

        minded people, the Unseen University. We travel to the Dread Lands for
        this, and then run into a Dragon. I have to tell you, this Dragon is
