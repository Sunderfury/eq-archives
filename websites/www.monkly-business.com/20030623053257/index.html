As more critique, you will get a general feel of what WE the MMoG game players think about it - i would say most will of us say it has potential, but as it stands right now - estral has said it best:
</p>
<p>
The graphics are good. I'll give it that. Eye candy does not a game make, though.

its gone, POST AWAY on your thoughts, i'll have a critique here over the weekend as i have yet to play since they went into patch city mode and several of my major beefs were addressed, and they are doing 3-4 patches per day to fix the other major problems. 
</p>
<p>
I will say this: it is my opinion -at this time- I cannot recommend anyone buy this game at release- if the devs get everything working correctly by thursday, then my opinion might change.

- England 7,500 copies of the book were stolen from a warehouse truck, the truck was recovered, the books were not. most warehouses have extra security just for the books with actually GUARDS being posted by the pallets of books- reporters and visitors to said warehouses are searched as they leave to make sure they do not have the book.
</p>
<p>
In new york a small book store put out 4 copies of the book in the window, the daily news purchased them and posted a review of the book - they are now being sued by rowling and the publisher for 100 million dollars. 
</p>
<p>
In Montreal a woman bought the book a week ago at a Wal-Mart, authorities are investigating how the book got placed on the shelf.
</p>
<p>
Friday night midnight - thousands of copies of the book will be sold. all the bookstores in my area are having "harry potter nights"
</p>
<p>
the Printing of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the largest single printing of a book ever with the initial release on the 21st being 8.5 MILLION copies. it is by FAR the most ordered book Amazon.com with close to a million preorders alone.
</p>
<p>
I get mine FedeX saturday morning :)580odd pages... saturday... no work...JOY.
the one thing i DO know about the book is one of the major cast of characters will die.

We do already know about the port issues.  There are actually many more than 1434 that are blocked.  
</p>
<p>
The problem is that whenever we pick a new port range, we end up with a bigger problem.  As an example, when we moved to 9000-9100 where no known problems exist, a couple weeks ago, we ended up with 5% of the test players not being able to connect.  
</p>
<p> 
We'll be moving to a different static range sometime in the near future, that's hopefully compatible with everyone's provider.  Finding that range has been quite the challenge.
 </p>
<p>
Thanks,
 </p>
<p>

i forwarded it to Alan V. and Scott H. (and a few others):
</p>
<p>
Plane of Tactics can use UDP port 1434 for connections (apparently, zone servers chooes semi-random port upon startup).
</p>
<p>
That is the same port by MS SQL Server (and related software like MSDE). A worm, called "SQL Slammer", propogated via a SQL Server vulnerability and cause quite a mess on the internet. Some ISPs chose to close UDP 1434 in response.
</p>
<p>
I called Verizon support and verified they have blocked this port. Further, they have no plans or timetable for reopening it.
</p>
<p>
PoTactics is now 100% inaccessible to some players, and will remain so as long as Microsoft, the ISPs, and SoE keep pointing fingers at each other instead of fixing the problem. 
</p>
<p>
This information was verified by the "Director of High Speed Data" at Adlephia (fatal67)
</p>
<p>
ok first we have this...
</p>
<p>
from <a href='http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/11153.php'>Internet Security Systems</a>
</p>
<p>
sql-slammer-worm (11153)
</p>
<p>
Remedy:
</p>
<p>
Administrators should apply the latest cumulative SQL Server patch, as listed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-061, and restart the system in order to protect against further infection. See References.
</p>
<p>
As a workaround, administrators should block UDP port 1433 and UDP port 1434 traffic to protect SQL Server databases with a firewall or packet filter.
</p>
<p>
NOW as to Everquest....
</p>
<p>
EverQuest client: 
</p>
<p>
UDP datagrams are sent to/from the player's PC (using ports numbered >1023) from/to the EverQuest servers (using ports numbered >1023). Additionally, ICMP Unreachables (ICMP type 3) are sent to/from the player's PC from/to the EverQuest servers.
</p>
<p>
Please note that EverQuest opens a random UDP data port from the player's PC every time EverQuest is run. Thus, the need to have all ports >1023 available
</p>
<p>
now we have the problem when you turn on the game, you get a udp port, if either of those two come up, you get disconnected, also when you zone in game, EQ gets a new udp port...if 1433 or 1434 are opened you get....DISCONNECTED.
</p>
<p>
The Solution is for Everquest Developers to REMOVE ports 1433 and 1434 from being chosen by the game and or alter the game to choose a specific range of ports all the time. The internet is too insecure now to have ALL those ports active.

I'll have a few things to say about the game - and the june 26th date - once the NDA gets lifted, and give you my recommendation.
</p>
<p>
SAN RAFAEL, Calif. and SAN DIEGO - June 16, 2003 - LucasArts and Sony Online Entertainment Inc. today announced Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, the highly anticipated initial installment of the first Star Wars massively multiplayer online (MMO) game series, will release June 26, 2003. The Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided online fan community now exceeds more than 500,000 registered members.
</p>
<p>
At launch Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided will offer four subscription plan options: Month-to-month - $14.99; three months - $14.00 per month; six months - $13.00 per month; and 12 months - $12.00 per month. By subscribing to any of the latter three plans, players can expect savings of up to 20 percent over the month-to-month rate.

A special collector's edition, which includes a book of game-related art, in-game wearables, pewter figurine, lapel pin and patch, and a signed manual, will be available for a suggested retail price of $79.95

<p>
"The release of Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided is a truly defining moment for LucasArts and we're confident the game will meet player's expectations," says Simon Jeffery, president of LucasArts.

<p>
"After three years of intense development, we're thrilled by the imminent release of Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided," says John Smedley, president, Sony Online Entertainment.

The Star Wars Galaxies team has been working non-stop to deliver a product that lives up both to the stature of the Star Wars license and the expectations that LucasArts had set for us."

<p>
We have updated the Run, Walk and Turn animations for the Luclin models.  As you can tell, new animations require a lot of data.  We're sorry for the size of the update, but we think you'll like the changes.
</p>
<p>
Thank you.
</p>
<p>
</i>
</ul>
Now if they only get to the COMBAT animations (2h mostly) we'd all be Much Much happier. Although I am curious as to why Barbarian Women are now <b>POWER WALKERS</b> (run animation is just a fast "walk").
</p>
<p>
As to the "download size" 25 seconds is all it took for me (DSL)- it is not large at all, less than a normal patch infact. In SWG I am getting patches that take 2hrs (last week) on dsl.
