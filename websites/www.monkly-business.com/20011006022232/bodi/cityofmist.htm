    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Knowing I had some time on my hands, and
      having heard of the fabled weapon, a 'Wu's Trance Stick' from other
      Brother Monks, I set off for the fabled City of Mist. The trip started in
      Firona Vie, by stocking up on well needed provisions, bandages and
      muffins, before I set off to the next part of my journey, the Swamp of No
      hope. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Reaching there, the next place was
      Trakanon's Teeth, which was hidden away from prying eyes by the entrance
      being concealed under a ledge above a large waterfall. Passing through the
      Teeth, and then onto the Emerald Jungle, I found both where dark places,
      and where populated with great beasts in the form of Giant Dragonfly
      creatures - I beleive known as Soulsyphers, large monkies, and even
      Dinosaurs!</FONT> </P>

        I had found the entrance to the City of Mist, I joined forces with a

        a little further in, underneath a lantern before a bridge that led into
        the City itself.</FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Soon my companions had to leave, but more
        brave people where ready to fight in this dangerous place, including
        some Brother Monks, named Twigaletto and Deburgh, both like me in search
        of the fabled Wu's Stick.</FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">More fights went on underneath the light
        of the lantern, and on the bridge, again with the denziens being various
        Golems, Skeletons and Ghosts, whether Shadows or Apparitions, until one
        particular bad turn of events happened to mar the so far succesful
        adventure.</FONT><BR>

        who had been bringing the monsters to us for most of the night, returned
        empty handed, and paused on the bridge looking back at the gates.
        Telling us that he was sure he was being followed, he uttered the words
        'Get ready'. The words had barely been spoken, when it seemed as though
        the whole population of the castle poured over the walls. Golems, Goo's,
        Ghost's and Skeletons came, many in number. A fighting retreat was
        formed, but unfortunatly Deburgh stayed that little bit too long, and
        fell on the bridge.</FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">More people came and went within the
        party, and later we where joined by a powerful Druid by the name of
        Porkins, who had the ability to turn us into Wolves. This was especially
        distressing for the skeleton population of the City of Mist, with all
        those 'doggies' hungry for bones......</FONT> </TD>

        long afterwards, another fight started to look bad. Two Haze Golems, a
        Captain of the Guard and a Shadow where in the fight, and everyone stood
        there ground and fought, but I started to get hit hard and fast by one
        of the golems. Dropping to the ground did not work, and the Golem was
        not fooled, and trying again resulted in me falling to the ground
        incorrectly.<BR>
         <BR>
         Starting to get hit really hard now, I then accidently sat down in
        front of the Golem, who took this opportunity to smash me really hard in
        the face. This was all too much for me, and so I ran for the Emarald
        Jungle.<BR>

         Bandaging up, I rested to the jeers of 'Brave, brave</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">brave Sir Bodi', and then a hungry
      Trakanonsaur decided to take a chunk out of me as well while I was sitting
      on the floor. Stumbling back into the City, and more cat calls from my
      group, they ask me again to show the 'sitting technique' I had used.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Abligingly, I sit, only to have a Shadow
      who was hiding in the bushes leap out and smash me while I joked around.
      Vowing never to sit again, we continue the fight, until it came to a point
      where the City became too populated, with even people sitting on both
      balconies.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Unfortunatly, my adventure here ended
      shortly afterwards, and a Wu's Trance Stick had not been found, although a
      Wraithbone Hammer was releived from a Skeleton there.</FONT></P>
