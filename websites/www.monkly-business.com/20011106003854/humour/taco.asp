&lt;Customer enters&gt;<br>
Brad: Welcome to our taco bell! Perhaps you'd like a taco? Our taco's are much better than other tacos, we have 200k people buying our tacos. Now how many fast food restraunts can say that?<br>
Customer1: Umm..yeah.. <br>
&lt;Customer backs away slowly from Brad over to the counter where Abashi is grinning evily&gt;<br>
Abashi: What can I do for you sir?<br>
Customer1: How about a taco?<br>
&lt;Customer glaces behind his shoulder to see Brad laughing a mad laugh&gt;<br>
Abashi: GM bannalot, make this man a taco! &lt;whispering: a ranger taco&gt;<br>
&lt;Customer goes over fills up drink and sits&gt;<br>
Customer1: What the..I'm stuck to my seat, I can't leave this taco bell!<br>
Abashi: Here's your taco sir!<br>
Customer1: K, thanks.<br>
&lt;Customer beings to eat..about 1/5 done with taco&gt;<br>
Customer1: Wow this taco is pretty good!<br>
&lt;Customer eaths about oooh..39/60 of the taco&gt;<br>
Wow, this is excellent! This is a wonderful taco!<br>
Abashi: &lt;whispering to bannalot&gt; are you sure thats the ranger taco?<br>
GM bannalot: Oh yes..just wait..muahhaha<br>
&lt;customer getting to mid 40's/60 done with taco&gt;<br>
Customer1: hrmm those last few bites were kind of unpleasant..maybe it will be good like before if I keep eating.<br>
&lt;customer keeps eating&gt;<br>
Eww..this is getting really bad...I could throw it away..but I've already spent the time to get this and payed for it..I could get another taco but that would take more time and money..<br>
&lt;Abashi approaches customer1&gt;<br>
Abashi: Actually sir, not only is the response from most customers on this taco good, our testers report it is just as good as any other taco here! Perhaps you are eating it wrong, try closing your eyes so you can't see it's obvious problems, and stabbing yourself! With a knife in you you won't even notice how bad the taco is!<br>
&lt;Customer1 pulls pants off, and runs from taco bell like a madman&gt;<br>
&lt;Bannalot, Abashi, and Brad laugh histerically&gt;<br>
Brad: We got his money! Muahaha thats all that matters!<br>
&lt;The evil trio sits in wait for more customers..&gt;</p></FONT></ul></ul>
