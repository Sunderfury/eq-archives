They Broke alot of UI's today. Also nothing about the Book in  Great Divide Mentioned or Beastlord pets in the Plane of Sky or any Alterations to The Rathe encounter in Plane of Earth B.
</p>
<p>
Also after over a YEAR of being BROKEN, Acrylia Caverns got REVAMPED!! - I feel sorry for The one guild(Ring of Valor i believe is their name) that keyed up for it since... they have to do the key quest over if there is a key now.

<p>
** Tip of the Day **
</p>
<p>
When you first log in you will be presented with a Tip of the Day window.  We've added this window to provide helpful insight to new players, and perhaps a few tips for experienced players as well.
</p>
<p>
** Gameplay **
</p>
<p>
- Any character 10th level and under that attempts to attack a 'red' /con NPC will receive a warning about the danger of such an action.
</p>
<p>
- Low level characters now memorize and scribe spells much faster.
</p>
<p>
- Guards in Steamfont, Misty Thicket, Butcherblock, Nektulos, East Freeport and West Freeport should be less likely to run through the newbie zone destroying the wildlife
</p>
<p>- Improved the respawn rate for monsters in Steamfont, Misty Thicket, Butcherblock, Nektulos, East Freeport and West Freeport.  In these zones they were respawning less frequently than in all other newbie zones.
</p>
<p>
- Added food and bag merchants to the newbie yards of Steamfont, East Freeport, West Freeport, Butcherblock and Nektulos.
</p>
<p>
** Spells **
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug that was causing damage shields to assign the credit for their damage to the wrong person.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug that caused a short delay in the hit point updates from healing spells.
</p>
<p>
- Removed Beastlords from the list of classes that can use Strength of Stone.  They were never intended to get it, as they have a better spell of the same type at the same level (Furious strength).
</p>
<p>
- Pets will no longer disappear when the pet owner casts a cancel magic type spell on the PC that the pet is attacking.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug that would allow PC's to be attacked by PC controlled pets (in non-PvP situations).
</p>
<p>
- Talisman of Alacrity now works on the group and not just the caster.  It also has the proper icons now.
</p>
<p>
- Modified the text messages on many stun spells to prevent some confusion with their effect on stun immune mobs.  The message has been changed from "You have been stunned" to "You are struck by a sudden force."  
</p>
<p>
- Torment of Argli no longer overwrites Torment of Scio.
</p>
<p>
- The Lich series no longer conflicts with other DoT effects.  This affects Dark Pact, Allure of Death, Call of Bones, Lich, Demi Lich, Arch Lich, Deathly Temptation, Pact of Hate, Ancient: Master of Death and Seduction of Saryrn.
</p>
<p>
- The Flame Lick line of spells no longer overwrites hit point buffs such as Valor and Skin like diamond.  This affects Flame Lick, Immolation, Breath of Ro and Immolation of Ro.
</p>
<p>
- Changed the name of the druid spell Fury of Ro to Immolation of Ro to avoid confusion with the focus effect Fury of Ro.
</p>
<p>
- Changed the icon for Kragg's Mending to a heart icon to match other Heal spells.
</p>
<p>
- Froglok illusion now changes the character's perspective to the proper height.
</p>
<p>
- Night's Dark Terror has regained its Scarecrow illusion.
</p>
<p>
- Added sounds to several spells that were lacking them.
</p>
<p>
- The cost of the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk has been cut in half.
</p>
<p>
** Zones **
</p>
<p>
- Acrylia Caverns, Hollowshade Moor and Grimling Forest have been revamped.  We have updated the content in these zones to more accurately represent their design intentions and to address concerns voiced by players.
</p>
<p>
- If you have had an issue with your Plane of Earth B keys, please speak with Muzzrap again and he should be able to straighten things out.  Please make sure that you have the raid group that you want to get keyed set up and by your side when you do this.
</p>
<p>
- The Trial of Fire event will be much less likely to damage people not actually in the trial.
</p>
<p>
- We've made a pretty extensive pathing update to the Lake of Ill Omen and Beholder, along with several fixes to specific cases in several zones.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed a bug with the Xegony encounter in Plane of Air.
</p>
<p>
- The spires in the Dreadlands are once again sending folks to Luclin.
</p>
<p>
- Protectors of Growth now actually protect the Plane of Growth again.  Beware.

<ul>** The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk **
</p>
<p>
Do not destroy the Hollow Acrylia Obelisk!  Due to the revamp of the Acrylia Caverns, this key will no longer serve its original purpose.  We do understand the difficulty of obtaining this key, and we don't want to see that effort lost.  We will be looking into a way to allow this key to retain its value, so don't destroy it.
</p>
<p>
** Items **

<p>
- Items with recommended levels now display any reduced AC component value in red.
</p>

<p>
- The Ivory Hilted Cleaver can now be used in the secondary slot (for those that can dual-wield).
</p>
<p>
- The Ornate Broadsword is no longer listed as usable in the secondary slot, since it is Paladin only and can't actually be used there.
</p>
<p>
- These items can no longer be worn by Frogloks (they were never intended for use by Frogloks):  Fright Forged Helm, Mundane Helm, Mundane Shield, Mundane Mask, Dread Forged Shield and Terror Forged Mask
</p>
<p>
- Murph's Minin' Pick no longer lists Clerics as a class that can use it, since they could not.
</p>
<p>
- Bone Bladed Scimitar no longer lists Beastlords as a class that can use it.
</p>
<p>
- Cracked Bone Shinguards now have a visible graphic when worn.
</p>
<p>
- Sharkbone Plated Shoulderpads effect is now "worn" rather than "combat".
</p>
<p>
- Stone Etched Mace now displays +135 mana instead of 1135 mana
</p>
<p>
- Extended Affliction III now works on spells with a 30 second duration (lowered from 36 seconds), so it now functions with Sermon of Penitence.
</p>
<p>
- Fireworks have casting sounds and Gnomish fireworks will no longer cause zones to crash.
</p>
<p>
- Compasses once again display the direction you are facing when you right-click and hold.
</p>
<p>
- The Hammer of Exoneration can now be used by Erudites and Dark Elves.
</p>
<p>
** NPCs **
</p>
<p>
- Half-Elf bandits are no longer treated as merchants (so they will now leave corpses).
</p>
<p>
- A Feral Amalgam is now a plant.
</p>
<p>
- Now only one Natasha Whitewaters can exist at a time.
</p>
<p>

<p>
- Pets no longer attack Tylis Newleaf when he teleports your group.
</p>
<p>
- Corrected a bug with AE rampage that caused it to not attack everyone it should.
</p>
<p>
** Quests **
</p>
<p>
- Fixed the drops for the Comatose spell quest.
</p>
<p>
- The Planar Projections for Bertoxxulous and Terris should no longer be able spawn in a location where they can't be reached.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed several issues with the 8th cudgel quest.
</p>
<p>
- Increased the drop rate on some quest items in Hate's Fury.
</p>
<p>
** Alternate Advancement Abilities **
</p>
<p>
- Made the Servant of Ro AA pet much more potent.
</p>
<p>
** Miscellaneous **
</p>
<p>
- Hit points gained from items are now display with the right value, and should help to prevent a few deaths from Cannibalization
</p>
<p>

As we all know the better the video card, the better the performance for most games. ati has the 9800 pro Nvidia has the geoforcefx5800ultra- both are 300-400 dollars-not cheap money. Most New MMoG's coming out this year are going to be DX9 games, but what does one do when they have a limited budget? ie they want to send UNDER 100 bucks for a good upgrade.
</p>
<p>
Have no fear Nvidia has just released and is avail in stores now their new Budget video card- the GeoforceFX 5200.
</p>
<p>
 It is not flashy, top of the line performance, but if you are playing with a geoforce3 or lower, it would be a great upgrade for you for the price - 80-90 dollars US for a full dx9 compliant card.
</p>
<p>
Performance wise it is about the equivulant to a geoforce4 mx440. however it does ALOT more than the g4 mx440 can do.
</p>
<p>
If you are looking for a decent upgrade from say a TnT2 or a geoforce2 card, then the 5200 is probably for you. Performance wise however the card with still just about the best bang for the buck is the geoforce4 ti4200 - which you can get for 111 bucks. but its not full dx9 compliant.
</p>
<p>
Personally i buy almost all my gear mail order from newegg.com. and they have just about the best prices around. i haven't ever had a problem with them - note to CA people - they are in california and will charge sales tax. as to what company's version of nvidia cards to get, i personally go for GainWard's cards. i have yet to have a problem (though there were some issues with the 64 meg g4 4200's last year)with that company's products. if i was to get an ATI based video card, i would get the Hercules brand, i used them before i use gainward(hercules switched to ATI boards a year or so ago))

Nothing much is happening in the world of MMoG's Atm.
</p>
<p>
I got my planetside Beta Info and am playing that game - BADLY - i suck at FPS games esp against other live people. the good news is my motion sickness isn't cropping up. I am currently having fun. good fun game, needs a bit more "depth" but it is fun playing. now to master the art of throwing a grenade.....
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Galaxies - not much there lately, beta 3 is in full swing - i did see a june16th release day on one of the gaming sites and that looks reasonable, they are at ~20k testers with 30k to go, no i am not in the beta, if anyone has an add a frend info thing SEND IT TO ME!!.
</p>
<p>
Horizons - beta 1 going on, not much info
</p>
<p>
Shadowbane is live and doing "OK" so far everything is working, but i have no heard much about the game-however from looking at eq etc, it is not making a significant dent in everquest's popularity.
</p>
<p>
Everquest- the Adjustment to the ring event keying process in poeb means you CAN get 50+ flagged doing the ring once, now if they fixed the Rathe Event.....
</p>
<p>
WoW - nothing new but beta IS rapidly approaching, i know ALOT of eqers are looking forward to trying this one. hoipefully i'll be one of the lucky ones and get into the beta afap. i've beta's alot of games lately. trying to break em all, and finding bugs can be fun esp since its not EXPLOITING in beta :P

** Plane of Earth - part II ** 
</p>
<p>
We're making another change to the method of access to the Plane of Earth B due to the feedback we've received from the community. 
</p>
<p>
If you have an Eroded Passkey, talk to Muzzrap Dirtdigger in the Plane of Tranquility. He will create a planar projection that will allow you to flag 6 members of your raid for entrance into the depths of the Plane of Earth. 
</p>
<p>
Also, the Mystical Arbitor will now spawn a planar projection upon his death that will allow you to flag many more members of your raid. 
</p>
</p>
        </ul>

          <br>
          Submitted by <a href="mailto:lenardo@monkly-business.com">Lenardo</a> on 4/17/2003 1:10:49 AM</p>
        <ul>
          <p class="MB_Body"><p>
Never did an official Editorial...critics be nice
</p>
<p>
Since the dps generated by a single raid is insufficient to kill all 12 of the Rathe(its  "being looked at" by SoE), someone had an idea, 
</p>
<p>
Only need one key per raid, why not bring......
</p>
<p>
MORE PEOPLE...
</p>
<p>
SoE upon hearing of the 200+ trying the rathe, implemented a change to the access to plane of earth b that -upset i think is putting it EXTREMELY mildly- the upper raid guilds</p>
<p>
Single key per person entry to Plane of Earth B.-
</p>
<p>
 AT THE SAME TIME, SoE made the key a random drop off of the ring bosses, with the gnome in knowledge handing out 6 keys per shard you get. so even if you win the event you could get Zero keys after several HRS of the ring event.
</p>
<p>
While the IDEA and the reasoning behind this change might have worked, unfortunately due to the out and out BUGGINESS of the ring event code - after getting 1-3 keys, none of the guilds did the ring event again.
</p>
<p>
SoE ASSUMED(never assume) that the guilds like FoH Afterlife etc were farming the shards, But, they were not. Each guild got enough keys to get into plane of earth b and NEVER touched the ring events again.
</p>
<p>
Thus the problem we have today, pretty much EVERY guild that was in plane of earth B is locked out due to not having sufficient keys to give to the gnome to equip their guild with access... 
</p>
<p>
I have heard they just rebooted PoE A so hopefully the lack of a Definate shard drop EVERY time got fixed. 
</p>
<p>
Sorry Guys in the Top Raid guilds, you've put up with alot of shit, but this one pretty much sucks.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think SoE should have a GM-Dev logon to EACH server and give all guilds that have fought the Rathe Event enough keys to distribute to all their members. of course this will never happen, though it would be the right thing to do, AND would be a good move by them to improve developer/user relations.
</p>
<P>
EDIT: i knew i forgot something last nite when i did this 
</p>
<p>
There is only one reason i can think of for this change...Plane of Time is NOT ready for "PrimeTime".
</p>
<p>
 SoE says the Plane of Time is ready, i say to them. 
</p>
<p>
Prove it.
</p>
<p>
Fix the buggyness of the Plane of Earth ring events, and fix the Rathe. and make it so the players can get all the keys needed in under a month
</p>
<p>
Prove the majority of players wrong when they say that the plane of time is not ready and that is the reason why the Rathe event is broken.
