            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              <p>So, ya thinking of heading to sola to farm and get xp from your mid thirties into forty. You&#8217;ve heard sola is a one of the best places for a monk to solo, gain nice xp and get rich. It is. But now there is better, Crystal Caverns.

<p>For those Monks in their early to mid 30&#8217;s who are unfamiliar with crystal caverns I suggest paying close attention to this guide, as getting to know and hunting in this dungeon will prove to be what I think is the fastest way in all of Norrath to level and gain wealth short of being power leveled and twinked. 

<p><b>What is so great about Crystal Caverns?</b>

<p>One of the biggest problems a monk has with gaining wealth is our lack of ability to carry loot in all forms, be it weapons or coin. To top it all off, to solo we are required to carry tons of bandages, which, unless there is a vendor handy, causes us to loot even less because of the weight from the band-aids. The twink monk with a few tink bags can get around part of this problem, but those of us who are not so lucky are destined to drop silver, copper, and whatever decent weapons we loot short of nice magic items. 

<p>The lower levels of Crystal Caverns is the answer to our problems. Not only do the mobs drop decent weapons and plenty of pp, they also drop some very nice magic items. This normally wouldn&#8217;t matter, after all, we can&#8217;t loot like others, but not in Crystal Caverns. In CC a monk can loot to their hearts content, because there is a bank no more than a minutes run from anywhere on the lower level. Additionally, adjacent to the bank there is a vendor who sells food, water, and band-aids. And to top it all off, the xp is amazing. Whether grouped of solo, you will level fast in Crystal Caverns.

<p><b>How to get there</b>

<p>Crystal Caverns is accessed through the Eastern Wastes which is adjacent to Iceclad, Kael Drakken and the Great Divide. The best places to be bound if you are intent on hunting here are West Freeport, Kael Drakken, or Thurgadin. The entrance is located inside the walls of the ry&#8217;gorr orc fort, which is found approximately in the middle of Eastern Wastes (location ca. neg 4000 pos 500). There is an entrance into the fort along the north wall. Just outside the entrance there are usually a few groups camped, pulling from inside the fort. If you are looking for buffs, this is the place to ask, as often times Crystal Caverns is quite empty. Once buffed (or not) run into the fort and take an immediate right, hugging the outside wall. Run about a third to half the way around fort until you come to what looks like an orc utility shed adjacent to the outside wall, with a bared gate/door, . Open gate, walk in, and click on big, blue, crystal thingy, and &#8230;&#8230;.poof, you are in Crystal Caverns.

<p>For a monk, I recommend sticking to the lower level of this dungeon. Main reasons being:

<p>--The dwarf town, with a bank, and vendors that you can sell to and buy band aids, food, and water. The vendors will not sell outright to any but gnomes and dwarves, so you have to use sneak. Everyone can use bank.

<p>--The lower level is probably the best place to solo in the dungeon based on where the spawns are, the number of wanderers, and the number of safe places to pull.

<p>As such, almost no information is included in this guide about hunting in the upper levels. If people want to know about upper levels, other information is posted on this message board which could be useful to you. Otherwise, if enough people want, I can update this guide to include upper level information. 

<p>On your first trip in &#8211;especially if your goal is the lower level - I suggest asking someone camping outside of orc fort for a levitate, and an invis. Once you get to know the area invis won't be necessary. The levitate isn't absolutely necessary either, it just makes getting to the bottom easier. 

<p>Now that your there, a little information about this dungeon

<p>Crystal Caverns is a 3 part dungeon, or 5 depending on how you look at it. The part of the dungeon that you zone into is known as the orc side, adjacent to that is the dwarf town, and finally the misc. area. The misc area actually consist of 4 main room/tunnel areas each dominated by one of 3 types of mobs, none of which are orcs. The first thing you need to know once you get into the dungeon is how to get to the dwarf town, so&#8230;&#8230;..

<p>Finding your way to the dwarves : The main feature of the orc-side is a cavernous mine shaft that leads from the upper level, down 4 levels to the bottom. The route to the bottom follows along or crisscrosses this cavern several times before it reaches the bottom. The area adjacent to the orc-side is the dwarf town.

<p>Once inside cc, run straight and pay attention to the right wall, eventually, it will open up into a cavernous pit (On your way to pit area, you may run by a few orcs, if invis, no problem, if not, just fd flop past) Looking down pit you will see it crisscrossed by numerous icy looking bridges. You can get to the bottom of this pit by running past this opening and following a somewhat convoluted path down, full of all kinds or orcs along the way, or, with levitate, you can just jump in and float to the bottom. You can also just take the plunge over the ledge without levitate. If you have safefall maxed, and full hp, you will be fine, taking somewhere in the mid 100&#8217;s in damage. I generally try to jump from bridge to bridge, and take no damage at all. This involve jumping down 3 or 4 times. If you miss one bridge, don't worry, the drop isn't too far.

<p>Once at the bottom - if the room is fully spawned - you will be surrounded by orcs. Using f9, look for a tunnel leading out, it is on the opposite side of the room as the icy stairway leading up. (I know these stairs are supposed to be velium and not ice, they just look like ice). Through the opening you will be in a rocky, mining, tunnel like the one you zoned into. At this point you can go left or right. Go right and run, run ,run, all the way to the dwarf town. If still invis, you will run past a few static spawns, and probably some wanderers. If not invis, no worries, they are easy to fd flop past.

<p>On the way to the dwarf town, you will leave the rocky, mining tunnel and enter a more geometric, icy looking, velium cave. This leads all the way to the dwarves and is what makes up the majority of the dungeon beyond the dwarves. 

<p>Run straight into dwarf town, and down the ramp. Immediately to the left will be 2 vendors, the first sells booze, the second sells band-aids, food, water, etc.
Now go back up ramp. Take a left before going back into area with guards, and immediately look for the walkway that crosses over to a heavy looking, metal door. This is the bank.

<p><b>NOTE, VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT TRAIN ORCS TO THE DWARVES EXPECTING THEIR HELP, THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU!!! AND, AS THIS IS AN AREA PEOPLE LIKE TO REST, YOU WILL PROBABLY GET SOMEONE KILLED.</b>

<p>Ok this warning is more for people who don't have fd, or the forgetful monk, but I thought I should let everyone know nonetheless.

<p>Now that you have found your base of operation, I will address the various areas to hunt on the lower level, including what mobs you will find, what loot they drop, and where best to fight.

<p><b>Orcside</b>

<b>Orc-side mobs:</b>

<p>This area is populated by ry&#8217;gorr orcs. There are two common types of orcs (ry&#8217;gorr miners, and ry&#8217;gorr watchmen), one somewhat common (ry&#8217;gorr oracle), one rare (ry&#8217;gorr herbalist), one very rare (ry&#8217;gorr inspector), and two named orcs (Foreman Rixact and Foreman Smason). 

<p><I>Miners (lvl 25-32) : </I>The miners make up the largest portion of the orcs you will encounter, they are also more likely to be wanderers. They are non-casting mobs and will always, and I mean always, be wielding a ry&#8217;gorr mining pick. This is a worthless weapon, but it gives you the opportunity to raise your disarm skill with ease if you haven&#8217;t done so yet. They always drop a few pp (up to 3pp) and sometimes drop different forms of velium. A small piece of velium sells for a few silver, a small brick of velium sells for 3pp, and a large brick of velium (which is rare) sells for around 10pp. They also drop various gems and jewelry, most of which sells for 3pp or so.

<p><I>Watchmen (lvl 29-33) : </I>The watchman tend to be static spawns, but are still quite common. They are none casting mobs and normally don&#8217;t wield weapons. When they do have weapons, they are usually one of the various velium weapons (one hand sword, 2 hand sword, dagger, great staff, mace..etc). Velium weapons all have shards of velium proc which is a 12hp dd, nothing to worry about. You can sell velium weapons to vendor for 3-8pp. Occasionally a watchman will have a frozen long sword (7/26) or 2 hander (12/40), these are nicer weapons, and sell for 15-20pp at vendors. Watchman also drop coin, but not velium.

<p><I>Oracles (lvl 30-34) & Herbalists : </I>There are always a few oracles running around CC, but they are far less abundant than miners and watchmen. The situation is similar with herbalists, but they are even more rare, and there is no guarantee that there is an herbalist running around anywhere. I&#8217;ve read other guides referring to herbalists as quite rare, this is just not the case. If you spend time in CC, you will see many herbalists, just far fewer than other mobs. The oracles and herbalists can spawn in several places, but there are areas that they are more frequently found. Both oracles and herbalists are shaman type spell casters. In melee they will always try to slow you with Tagar&#8217;s Insects. Fortunately, this one is often resisted, but it is no fun when it sticks. They will also try to poison you and often cast shards of velium. The poison is somewhat nasty but fades quickly. 

<p>Shards of velium is just plain a wussy dd and nothing to worry about. Both of the mobs wander around healing miners, watchman, and whatever other injured orc they see. Herbalists tend to run around at sow speed, oracles often do as well. These 2 mobs drop some of the most sought after loot in this dungeon. The oracles drop the Cloak of the ry&#8217;gorr Oracles as their rare loot (backslot, ac6, wis2, int2, mana10, cr10, mr10, weight 2, all/all). Herbalists drop 3 nice items. Herbalist pack is common drop (6slot, large item container, 30% weight reduction, weight 1), Crystal Covered Shroud is rare drop (chest slot, ac12, str4, wis4, int4, cr10, weight 1, wearable by monks and all casting classes excluding shaman, yes this includes clerics and druids &#8211;just large races and gnomes, sorry halflings and woodelves), and Blackened Crystalline Robe (BCR) is ultra-rare drop (chest slot, ac8, int6, cha5, cr10, weight 3.5, wearable by int-based casters &#8211;this is what many of the upper levels who come here are looking for).

<p><I>Inspector (lvl 34-36) : </I>The inspector is by far the most rare orc-spawn in this dungeon. He can be found in many places, and is usually wandering. He goes down quite easy, and is one of the most sought after spawns in the dungeon as he always drops the Crystalline Belt (ac5, wis3, agi3, hp10, weight 0.8, all/all).

<p><I>Foremen Rixact and Smason (lvl 33-38) : </I>These are the only 2 named orcs in the dungeon. They are very similar to each other, but from my experience Foreman Rixact generally spawns at a higher level than rixact, but this is only my observation and may not always be the case. Foreman Rixact can almost always be found in the bottom of the pit on the ledge just above the lowest level. Foreman Smason seems to spawn in several different areas. They drop velium weapons and frozen swords as their common loot, and the Foreman&#8217;s Skullcap as rare (headslot, ac8, str4, dex2, sta2,cr10, weight 2, gls effect). 



<p><b>What/Where to Whack mobs</b>

<p>Between the pit and the dwarf area, there are 3 spawns, usually 2 miners, and a watchman. The watchman can also spawn as a ry&#8217;gorr oracle, or Foreman Smason. The watchman spawns closest to the dwarves, then the 2 wandering miners spawn on the way to the pit. Several miners and the occasional oracle or herbalist wander this same stretch of tunnel, so at times you have to fd when trying to take out statics or wanderers because you're getting ganged up on. 

<p>If clearing tunnel from dwarf town towards pit, you can use ID on any of these mobs, as they always path towards area where it turns from mining tunnel into velium tunnel. They get caught in a goofy back and forth pathing loop, that goes down a little icy slope, back up towards mining tunnel, and then back again, over and over until you finish them. This is frustrating as it can be hard to hit them as they go up and down. Also, there is a velium crawler (I will describe this fella later) that wanders by here, and if you're low on hp to begin with, he is glad to take those leftover by the orc.

<p>The pit has something like 5-7 mobs when fully spawned. Usually including several miners, a watchman or two, sometimes an oracle or an herbalist, and almost always, Foreman Rixact and sometimes Foreman Smason (but I have never seen both together).

<p>Sometimes you can pull singles from pit, but it is not advisable as it is dangerous, and involves training entire room into the tunnel that leads to dwarf town, feigning (and hoping it doesn't fail), waiting for mobs to wander back, then grabbing the last one. Only do this if it is a slow day in cc, as you don't want to train this room onto an unsuspecting group that's wandering by, as it will probably mean their death, or just get them very mad at you..

<p>If you're lucky you will come upon the pit being camped by high level pc&#8217;s just looking for herbalist/oracle loot. If this is the case, just ask if you can hang out and take miners and watchmen as they spawn. They usually have no problem with this, and will help you if needed.

<p>Just beyond the pit, the tunnel has a branch to the right and keeps going straight. To the right is the point at which most of the wandering oracles and herbalists seem to spawn, wandering miners spawn here most of the time though. If you follow this branch it will take you up, around and back into the pit, just above the bottom level.

<p>Going straight you will start to go up, up, up. After 3 ramps you will come into an area with 3 static watchmen. Two are together and will both agro, one is off to the side and up a ramp and will not follow when you pull the first 2. The 2 watchmen can be pulled back down the tunnel, and are easy to fd split. I usually run down 1 or 2 ramps before I fd. After the first one is dead, rest, heal, and go grab the second, then the third. 

<p>There is a fourth one just up and beyond the third as well. He spawns just at the edge of the pit, where there are lots of other orcs, some occasionally dropping from the top. So I often just leave this one alone. Also, occasionally an Herbalist or oracle will spawn between the 3rd and 4th watchman. Any of these watchman can also spawn as an oracle, but this is gererally not the case. You must be careful here as miners and oracles wander back and forth through this area. Always try to take out any wanderers before you attempt these watchmen.

<p>Beyond the watchmen the tunnel continues up, and if you follow it long enough -crisscrossing over pit on velium bridges, going up, then down, then up again, and so on and so forth- you will come back to where you entered. This is not the way you should take out if you want to leave, it involves running by far to many mobs, and fd flopping takes to long for the trouble. There is a much easier way out, which I will address below.

<p>So that about covers the orcside, you can get good xp here soloing to about 37 or 38th level.</p>
