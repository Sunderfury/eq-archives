              <br><br><b> ITEMS</b>
<br><br>These are the items obtained as rewards for the war. Of these, the Lance, Crown and Choker are most sought after. The others often go to twinks or are used as trinkets. All are droppable.

<br><br><b>Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV</b>

<br><br>Also a multi

<br><br><b> THE END</b>

<br><br>You now have your ring (congrats) and 1 to 6 items to distribute as you/your guild see fit.

<br><br>Be careful when distributing items, as it can turn into a "naggy fest" quickly if it's a joint effort, or it's got pickup people. If your guild is capable of doing the war, you can bet you will be doing it many times, so you will get many chances of handing out this loot. Every paladin and SK in our guild now has a Crown, just some had to wait a month longer to get it.

<br><br>If you have a lot of none guild people officially helping, set the loot rules BEFORE you start. ie, who gets to roll on what.

<br><br>The Nexus Scion and all GD zone mobs will start to re-spawn around 30 minutes after the end of the war, although if you lose Thurgadin itself will be "dead" for longer.

<br><br>Also if you don't kill the Giant Spearmen they will despawn soon after the end of the war, before the zone re-pops.
<br><br><b> BUGS</b>

<br><br>We've had several bugs occur, including:

<br><br>1. Scripted words. I've never seen all the correct "scripted" words, esp the ones shouted by Aldikar and Narandi. But not to worry. The quest still works.

<br><br>2. The war not starting at all after handing in ring/note.

<br><br>3. The whole of "major wave" one not spawning. Just a 30 minute wait of nothing, and then straight onto major wave 2.

<br><br>4. Thurg does not re-pop when you lose the war. It's supposed to be out of action for 2 hours, so if it's any much longer throw in a /petition.

<br><br>5. Delays/Long pauses. Sometime when triggering the war, or between waves there can be "longer than usual" pauses. Just be patient.

<br><br>6. Zone reboot. We've had the whole zone reboot on us, throwing every person off in the zone and not letting you back on for 5 mins.

<br><br>7. At the end, multiple Aldikars. When you finally hand in the head and get each of the rewards, you end up with several copies of Aldikar spawning one on top of each other. Don't worry. Has no effect.

<br><br>Apparently most of the "bugs" with all waves appearing at once etc have now been ironed out, and we've never seen them.

<p><b> GRIEFERS & NEWBS</b>

<p>Be prepared to accept some abuse from the normal GD populace. There is always some disgruntled person who gets angry because their camp will be gone for 2 hours, and you will always get someone threatening to train and/or kill the dwarfs. Make sure you handle it appropriately. We always make sure we do a /report of their text, as doing so is harmless, and if they do actually disrupt your war you have proof. If they were just being dorks, no harm done.

<p>As stated above, providing free TL's out helps in most cases to get rid of people who do not or should not be there.

<p>Throughout the war people will be zoning in and asking for groups or asking what's going on. Just spam your hot key that a Ring War is going on, that there are no normal mobs, no exp groups, and it's not a safe place etc etc.

<p>Try and keep ooc/shout as little as possible, and if necessary create a channel for your War if lots of none guild people are helping. Getting into ooc arguments only causes grief.

<p>If you do see someone training Dwarfs off, quickly ask them to die and say you will rez them. If they manage to train a Hero to the giants the hero can die if you don't rescue them.

<p>Remember, on "blue" servers you are triggering a quest, and therefore it's against the PnP rules for someone to cause disruption to the game play by ruining the quest by killing Dwarfs or purposefully training.

<p>If it does happen, /petition them asap, try and /report as much of it as possible, and don't get into an ooc flame war over it. Whilst it's very unlikely you will get any recompense for it, the person can hopefully be cautioned and soul marked (of course, depending upon how much proof you have and whether the GM screwed his wife the night before !).

<p>If your on a PvP server, then good luck.

<p>Also be aware that GD is normally a lvl 30-40 exp zone. This means you will have people porting in via the Scion or Ring, with possibly no way out.

<p>It's easy for them to accidentally get in the way if they are not careful, and either die or even worse, train giants to Thurgadin.

<p><b> NOTE on MQ'ing</b>

<p>It IS possible for various stages of the quest to be MQ'd.

<p>The 1st hand in of ring/note can be done by anybody with 9th ring/note, although the note giver will lose their note so have to get a new one off the Dain. I've done this before for someone else.

<p>The 2nd hand in of the ring can be done by anybody with 9th ring, and they will be followed by Zrelik

<p>The 3rd hand in of the ring and head can be done by anybody with a 9th ring. In theory the head itself can be looted by someone other than who Zrelik is following, and the head looter can then finish up, or it could be MQ'd with someone else with a 9th ring.

<p>What does this mean ? It means that if your doing the quest for someone who lost/does not have their note, and someone else does have it your OK.

<p>It means that if the person doing the quest (and has Zrelik) goes LD, someone else with 9th can loot the head and hand in and get the 10th ring instead.

<p>However, as with all MQ'ing be aware that it CAN go wrong, and the GM's will NOT re-imburse any items lost due to MQ'ing. So be it on your own head. It's always best to have the "correct" person do all the bits, so at least you can be recompensed by a GM if you lose anything.

<p>We had someone lose their 9th Coldain ring when triggering the war because of an incorrect MQ, so I'd suggest not doing it if possible.


<p><b> NOTE on KOS (to Coldain) people</b>

<p>It's very easy for KOS to Coldain people to help in the war, just as long as they stay away from any Coldain. It's VERY important that they stay away, as if they agro and then train the dwarfs off all hell can break lose, and you can lose hero's. If they agro, either let them die, or you can try and spell mem wipe.

<p>A good place for KOS people to gather is in the middle up from the buff station near the "middle tree".

<p>Additionally it's possible for a KOS person to actually do the 10th ring.

<p>Minimum faction required for hand in is dubious, so sneak from behind gives you indifferent for the final hand in. Just be careful to not agro on the hand in, else any nodrop items will poof... ie, the head and your 9th ring.

<p><b> Divine Aura Scroll</b>
<p>Once you have your 10th ring, there is an extra reward you can get as Seneschal Aldikar suggests.If you are <b> Ally</b> to Dain faction, handing in your 10th ring to the Dain himself will return you your ring, along with a LORE scroll which has one charge of Divine Aura - 2.5 secs click cast on it.

<p>You can do this as many times as you want (getting a new scroll every time you use it). As long as the Dain is up of course, and as long as you keep Ally faction. If you lose Ally and hand your ring in, he will eat it.. So always check your faction first !!

<p>The scroll cast is easily interruptible of course as monks have no channelling skill (so not as useful as a SBI for instance.. insta-click) but not to be sneezed at. Useful in some pulling situations or when you need to make suicide dashes.

<p><b> FINALLY</b>

<p>The war is great fun to take part in. Even after all these times I have done it, I still get a rush every time it's triggered and you go running around GD. It's a real spectacle to see, your guild charging over the white snow to engage a mass of giants running towards you. You can almost hear the battle cries of people, and as I've got a good system I have full particle effects on, so it's great to see giants being blasted all over the place.

<p>It can get scary at times when your tanking a mob alone, hoping it will be slowed soon or a cleric will get in heal range, and it's great to solo an (admittedly) slowed Veteran.

<p>The Narandi takedown is a whirlwind of flurries and death.

<p>When eventually your turn comes, and you trigger the war, and then do that final hand in, and click it.. it's a great day. It takes far more organization and effort and guild time than the Monk Epic does, and in it's own way is as much an accomplishment.

<p>I hope this guide helps you in completing your 10th ring.
