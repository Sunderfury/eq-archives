What they need? What about me and my fellow monk friends? What about our needs? Now I know most of you are going to say, we have it all already. And In fact, I feel we do. We can Melee with the best of them, we have great special attacks, we can Feign Death and Mend. Basically we are a completly functional class, except for ONE thing. We need pet Monkeys.....</p><p><strong>THE MONK - MONKEY PETITION</STRONG></p><p>I, Swade Couch, on behalf of the monks all around Norrath, DEMAND, the following changes to be implemented immediately. From this point on, All monks should have access to the Monkeys, under the following guidelines.</p><p>1. At level 1, we receive our first Monkey, the SPIDER MONKEY.</p><p><ul><LI>The Spider monkey, should be able to pick the pockets of merchants for a few coppers each attempt.<LI>We will have A charisma bonus of +15, if we show our Spider monkey to a merchant of the opposite sex.<LI>Our Spider monkey should be able to ride the backs of any monsters found in the newbie areas (i.e.snakes,rats, hell even bats) until the monster collapses and dies from exhaustion.</p></ul><p>2. At level 8, we receive our first upgrade the CHIMPANZEE</p><p><ul><LI>we can dress our chimps up in clothes and armor, so to confuse the monster and attack both of us.<LI>we can send the chimp to the banks to withdraw and deposit money<LI> we will be able to command our chimp to throw his feces in the eyes of an attacker in order to blind him.</p></ul><p>3. At level 16, we recieve our next monkey, the BABOON </p><p><ul><LI>our baboons, will always be in heat (big red butts) causing all races to become violently ill at the sight of them</p><p><LI> they will be able to screech and howl causing extreme pain and damage to any attacking monster<LI>They will also be able to fling feces in the eyes of our attackes ( we just loved this idea to much)</p></ul><p>4. At Level 24, we receive our Last upgrade, the GORILLA</p><ul><p><LI>our gorilla will basically rip the arms off of any monster that gets in our way.<LI>our gorilla will rip the legs off of any monster that gets in our way<LI>our gorilla will rip the head off and deficate down the neck of any monster thats get in our way</p></ul><p>I would like to thank everyone out there for reading this petition and supporting us in our cause. We dont want much, just what is rightfully due to us, MONKEYS.</p><p>Swade Couch, Monk of the Monkey Chim-Chim server</p></FONT></ul></ul>
