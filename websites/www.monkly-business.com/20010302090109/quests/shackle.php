They are the equivilent of the Freeport Sashes, and Qeynos Headbands.  Although perhaps slightly more useful:)
<FONT size=5 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Shackle of Dust</p></FONT>
Give your newbie note to Grand Master Glox.  He gives you this shackle.  You may like to put it in the bank untill level 7, incase you die, and it decays on your corpse.
<FONT size=5 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Shackle of Clay</p></FONT>
The first quested shackle.<br>Talk to Master Raska in the Court of Pain.  He calls you a whiff, and upon asking him what a 'Whiff' is, you recieve the chance to prove that you are not so weak as he might think.  Follow the prompts, and take the four slot bag he gives you.  You need four items to fill this bag.  We will go over each in detail.<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Goblin Scout Beads</p></FONT>
These drop from low level Goblin Scouts in Lake of Ill Omen.  Take five minutes, head out here, and kill a Goblin scout (watch out for higher level goblins), they should only be around level 4.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Sabertooth Cub Canine</p></FONT>
These drop off Sabertooth CUBS.  They are usually around level 5.  Also in Lake of Ill Omen, so get this and the Scout beads at the same time.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Froglok Skipper Stone</p></FONT>
This tiny range weapon drops off Froglok Skippers, a fairly common spawn around the Swamp of No Hope newbie zone.  Approx. level 5 again.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Large Scorpian Pincer</p></FONT>
These drop off Large Scorpians, which are level 6ish.  Look for them around the Field of Bone newbie area, and the edges of the Pit.<br><br>Stick these items in the bag, combine them, and return to Master Raska for your Shackle of Clay.
<FONT size=5 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Shackle of Stone</p></FONT>
To prove that you are true to the cause of the Swifttail, you must perform the task of cleansing.  Ask Master Raska about the Shackle of Stone, and recieve your mission to hunt the Iksar Bandits, and return their masks.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Iksar Bandits</p></FONT>around level 9 in the Field of Bone pit.  Get the two masks, and if possible, a third to wear if you aren't twinked. <br><br>Iksar Bandits also drop torn notes on occasion.  Get the two halves and hand them to the Grand Master to get a flute, whos use is yet to be figured out.  Read the notes for a good story.<br><br>Return the Masks and your two previous Shackles, to recieve the glorious Shackle of Stone!
<FONT size=5 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Shackle of Rock</p></FONT>
Note : You can start this quest whenever you like, but I found Feign Death was nessacary before I could finish it.<br><br>Talk to Master Niska in the Court of Pain about the Shackle of Rock, and she tells you that she will give you the shackle if you bring her back the fists of Talon Southpaw, one of the greatest, fastest, strongest, Iksar Monks who ever lived.
You may want to buy the book about Tallon from the Court Chronicler if you have not already, and go ask the Bar keep in the Tink and Babble about him.  Seems he was almost impossibly-fast with that left hand.  Here's the catch ; he had two left hands, explaining his lightning speed.  Time to get those fists.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Fist One</p></FONT>
Dropped off a Sarnark Courier in the Lake of Ill Omen
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Fist Two</p></FONT>
You are not the first Monk to look for Talon's fists.  Another one, a greater Master, has ended up in the Timorous Deep, after searching many years for the fist.  The Iksar Master has the 2nd fist.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Fist Three</p></FONT>
This is held by the Dancing Skeleton that an Ogre in Timorous Deep can summon for 5gold.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>How to get them</p></FONT>I suggest you try and get the Sarnar Courier's fist first.  If possible, get a ranger, or higher level Druid or Bard, to try and track him for you.  He is around level 12 - 15, easy to kill, and spawns around the ruins near the Firiona Vie river in the Lake of Ill Omen.<br><br>In Timorous Deep, there is a rogue Iksar Monk, named An Iksar Master.  He has the second fist, but before he will hand it to you, you must bring four items back to him, placed and combined in a bag he gives you.  Don't worry about getting the bag yet, we'll do that later.<br><br>The four items are:
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Excavtors Claw.</p></FONT>This drops off Burynai Excavators in Kurn's Tower, and in the Pit.  	Excavators are fairly easy for their level.  Around 16ish.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Intact Mandible.</p></FONT>This drops of Skulking Brutling, in Warsilks Woods.  Around level 	12, easy kill.  Drop is semi-rare though, it may take awhile.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Sparring Gloves of a Goblin Pit Fighter.</p></FONT>These drop off Goblin Pit Fighters, a semi-	rare spawn in Warsilks Woods.  Get this after the Mandible.  Head to any set of 		Goblin ruins and kill everything that spawns (you may need some help for this) untill	you get the Pit fighter.
<FONT size=4 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Torn Sash from a Young Ronin.</p></FONT>Ug.  Worst part of the quest.  You need to head to	South Ro, and kill a Young Ronin.  Back to this part later.<br><br>The third fist is held by the Skeleton that the Great Oowomp will summon if you give him five gold.  The Great Oowomp is on the Ogre Island, where the boats stop in Timorous.  Here is the catch though, the hand is only the thumb.  The thumb is a container, in which you must place and combine, his fingers.  His fingers, named 'A Withered Finger X', where X is a length, drop off the Fingered Skeleton in Kurns.  I hope you hunted here and managed to pick some up.  Camp the Fingered Skeleton untill you have all four fingers.<br><br>Now to head out to Timorous.  Get a map of Warsilks Woods, if you don't already know, and head to The Overthere (safest way is to follow the beach, and then turn inland at the far end of the zone).  In the Overthere, head towards the evil Outpost, and swim out to the boat when it arrives, making sure to avoid any guards, as they will kill you.  This boat will take you to Timorous.  After you zone in, stay on the boat untill it arrives at the Ogre Island.  Jump into the water, and swim around to where the Barge headed for Oasis docks.  (Have a look at this <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/mapz/timorousdeep1.jpg">map</a> I'll refer to it from now on).  Take the barge to Oasis.<br><br>After you reach Oasis Dock, head left, facing into the beach, down the shore, and then when you hit the rock wall, follow it until you zone into South Ro.  Here, find (you may need track again) a Young Ronin and kill them.  They are slightly more powerful than a Derv, and you may need help.  They are a semi-rare spawn, and wander around the desert part of the zone.  Kill them and take their torn sash.  Head back to Oasis, and get the boat to Timorous.<br><br>Arriving at the Ogre Island, don't get back on the boat straight away.  Head towards the Great Oowomp, using sneak and trying to avoid other Ogres.  I did this at level 19, and everything except the Oowomp conned blue.  Get as close as possible to the Oowomp, and then Feign Death.  Then, get five gold ready, un-feign and quickly give it to the Oowomp.  If you un-feign with sneak on, you will have a few seconds before he and the other ogre near by agro.  Give him the cash, and re-feign.  He summons a skeleton.  After the skeleton as popped up, un-feign again, with sneak on, and ask him who Talon Southpaw was.  Follow the cues and get your fist.  Feign again.  These guys are weak, and if you are fast, shouldn't lose much health.  Get up, run to the docks, FD to get them off you, and rise and repeat untill you are on the boat back to The Overthere.  Whilst here, stick the four fingers into the container you just got from the Skeleton and combine them.  Ta da, the second fist.<br><br>On the way back to Overthere, keep your eyes open for the Bandit shipwreck (see the map), when you see it, jump off the boat, and then head for approx -5000, 3000, and the Iksar Master (see the map).  Find him, ask him what are the Fists of Talon Southpaw, and then offer to return it.  Take the bag, put the gloves, claw, mandible, and sash in it, combine them, and give him the bag back.  Ta da!  Third fist.<br><br>Now you have some choices.  Take the boat back to Overthere, or, if you have balls, swim to the Firepo(r)t room, and take the Cabilis teleport home, to give in the fists and get your Shackle of Rock!<br><br>Note : If you have a high level enchanter friend, you can just get him to charm the Ogre and the skeleton.  That makes it about 1000x times easier to do the quest, but not all of us have a high level enchanter friend, eh?:)</ul></FONT>
