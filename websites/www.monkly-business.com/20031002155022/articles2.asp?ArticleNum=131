          <ul>
            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              <p>Advanced trading, as opposed to regular trading, is a full time job. Every server has a few of those, and every server has a few of those that are very good at what they do and often put uber guild vaults to shame. In this guide I will try to explain some of the princibles behind advanced trading and hopefully give you some insight into that field.

<p>Trading is probably the only occupation in EverQuest that is entirely different than everything else you can do in EverQuest (IE: kill stuff) and yet very similar to real life. Everyone knows the phrase "Supply versus Demand" yet few people know what it means to them in EverQuest let alone real life. 

<p>So what does it mean? Am I going to tell you to invest in stuff that's going to go up in demand and down in supply? Hell no! First of all, supply is technically never going to drop in EverQuest as nothing breaks down. As for demand, that is unpredictable. You never know what new items are going to be introduced tommorow and therefore you can forget about trying to make long term investments. 

<p>So how can you make a buck at trading? The answer is to take advantage of the people who do a lot of the killing in EverQuest and a bit of the trading. Sounds harsh? It is. The only way you could make money trading is by making other people lose it. They may not realise it. People may not frown upon such money making, But that does not change the fact that you're making money on the expense of others.

<p>Still interested? Great. So what do you need to do in order to take advantage of those people who spend their time killing mobs? Two things, mainly.


<p>First, you need to make a name for yourself. This is the hard part. Basically, if you sit in your server's trading zone long enough (At least a few weeks) buying and selling (Even if you buy and sell at the same price, you've still gained something - Reputation) you will eventually be recognized as a trader. What does that mean? That you will begin getting tells from various people. Some will want to know if you can get them a bloodpoint for that Heriophant's cloak they just got. Some will want to know if you can get them a Heripphant's cloak for the bloodpoint they just got. And some will want to know how many flawless diamonds you can get for their guild as they need 73 of them and have quite a few things in their guild vault. Now, on to the next thing you need.

<p>Flexability. Along with getting buyers, you also need to get sellers. This means you first of all need to aspire to have most of your assets in a liquid state (Either platinium or very easily sold equipment). In addition it helps greatly to know what guild is fighting where, who is farming what and who just got a cool item in a GM quest. All that info in conjunction with liquid assets would allow you to take advantage of your reputation.

<p>Finally, a couple of points to remember.

<p>Reputation comes in two forms - good reputation and a bad one. By default, you will not have a good one as a heavy trader. People don't really like traders. They know you're making money on their expense. While they are happy to get the item they want from you they will curse your name the day after when their friend logs on and tell them they could have got it for half the price. The only way to get a good reputation short of giving stuff away is to offer refunds as long as it is viable for you to do so. Suprisingly, a bad reputation is just as effective for trading as a good one, or so I have discovered. And you're not likely to become richer, even in the long run by having a good reputation. HOWEVER, keep in mind you may actually want to continue playing EverQuest some day, and when that day comes a good reputation would go a lot further than phat lewt.

<p>Before finnishing I would like to leave you with one more tip. If you happen to have two copmuters it is tremendously beneficial to be trading with two different chars at the same time. You must make sure no one knows you are both chars or you will gain nothing of it. You can use your alternate char (Even if it doesn't have a rep) to fish out sellers and buyers to find out exactly what they are after before making offers with your main charactar. There are also more malicious ways of using a second charactar, but I'm not going to point them out as they I personally condem them and they can get you in trouble with GMs (Which will already be on your back when you've got 500k in the bank). Unfortunately it doesn't take someone with a very active imagination to come up with these malicious ways so I wouldn't be surprised if many of you were victims to such abuse.
