          <ul>
            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              <p>There are two hurtles to farming the hero bracer quest. Finding and killing the Mino Hero and getting a high warm faction with the Steel Warrior guild in Qeynos. 

<p><b>Finding him</b>

<p>In steam front at the mino slaver cave you will find a mino named &#8220;A Mino Slaver&#8221;. There are 5 of them in the zone but the one you are looking for is the static one that is located just inside the cave entrance. He he respawns every 6 minutes. The mino hero doesn&#8217;t spawn using the conventional &#8220;placeholder&#8221; law. He has a trigger of sorts. Killing the cave doorman (a mino slaver) will rarely result in the spawning of the mino hero immediately afterwards. you must have patience, he may spawn right away or he may spawn after killing the trigger man for two hours. 

<p>Its completly random realy, there is no counter like every 100 kills of a mino slaver spawns the hero. I say this because he has been known to spawn back to back. The mino Hero doesn&#8217;t spawn on top of the slaver. He spawns outside across the valley. Look for the tree on the other side near the gear. Here is some info on him. He is a 37-40 fighter class and gave me a hard time at 48 49. ID works on him. He is a roamer, he starts his patrol at the tree I mentioned before and goes clockwise around the gear, passing the skeletons, and ending up a little bit inside the mino caves. Of course he will only end up there if no one aggro&#8217;s him before he gets there. And if he stands inside the cave for more than 5ish seconds he will despawn.


<p><b>Faction</b>

<p>You turn in the shackles to the Qeynos Warrior guildmaster. You can tell if it is him buy hailing him. He will reply by saying something about escaped gladiator. You can increase the steel warrior faction in many ways. All of them but one is time consuming. Give milk to the fisherman at the east commons pond and he will give you steel warrior faction. So just bring lots and lots of milk with you. You must have a better than neutral faction with him to do this quest though. The next easiest faction is to do the Freeport warrior deathfist slashed belt. 

<p>You can also do qeynos warrior newbie quests like collect batwings and the escaped catman gladiator quest. All this quests are located on the alakazam quest database and are explained in more detail than I can. NOTE there are different levels of warm. You don&#8217;t &#8220;qualify/worthy&#8221; of doing the bracer quest if it&#8217;s a low warmly. If you turn in the shackles and your faction is not worthy enough the warrior guild master will eat the shackle. Hail him and say &#8220;what second escaped gladiator&#8221; if he things your worthy of the hero bracer quest he will give you the details of the quest. If you have a bard friend you can have him loot the shackle and turn it in. (the shackle is no drop) and sing his faction song to save time.

<p>The experaince gained from this quest is very nice even for high level players. and you can sell the bracer for about 1k. If you intend on farming the bracer all day i recomend you clean out your bank. bind yourself at the akanon bank. and after you complete the quest in qeynos get nekid put everything in the bank and kill yourself by drowning. death gate, hehehe. 

<p><b>a mino slaver</b>

<p>I mentioned that there were 5 a mino slavers in the zone. One of them roams around outside and is the placeholder for the niltz clockwork spider. It is part of a very monkly quest called the kerran toy quest. The quest is explained in detail <a href="http://www.serenadeofthedragons.com/guides/kerran.html">HERE</a>. The other three a mino slavers are for a sk quest and they all scattered deeper inside the mino cave.
