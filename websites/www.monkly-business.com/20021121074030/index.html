** By Winged Messenger **
</p>
<p>
A lone messenger streaks across the rocky roads of the mighty Wakening Lands, an urgent message kept safely within his talons. Dire news he brings to his master, the Lord Yelinak; there is much turmoil in wake of the prismatic's release, and he must inform the ancient dragon of the weary times to come. As he rushes past the lumbering trees on all sides of him, he harks back to a more peaceful time. Certainly the brow of his mighty Lord showed less strain, less agitation, though not much. He had always thought that the prismatic's release would surely be more problematic than anything else he could imagine. He now knew that there was much more at stake than ever before, and that the Shrine would need to be on its guard.
</p>
<p>
As he came to the entrance of the Shrine, he tensed for a moment, hoping that this dire news wouldn't end the life that he and his kin had known for so long. Yet he feared that nothing could stop that change, for the might of the Kin would be tested in the coming times, and there would surely be dangers he had yet to see. He made his way through the corridors up to his master's chambers. As he came closer, he noticed new members of the Kin he had never before seen. As large as his Lord, they spoke quietly amongst themselves and with Yelinak himself. He was unnerved by this startling addition to the Shrine, but felt that it was likely necessary. Perhaps his Lord had already heard the news and had already begun making plans. Either way, it was his duty to inform Yelinak of the recent events; the Giants would know no struggle like that which the Shrine would give them.
</p>
<p>
He walked towards Lord Yelinak, majestic in his appearance yet with a certain calming aura about him. He cleared his throat and began, "M'lord Yelinak, I bring news from the East..."

          <p class="MB_Body">The messageboards are the largest part of this site. They were my reason for creating the site in the first place (when the monk boards before it closed down) and they are the #1 reason I keep the site going.<p>Everquest and its various communities have always had close ties with ezboard. Most of the original EQ community boards ran on ezboard back in its early days when it was a single server ran by a single man. Now ezboard is a large commercial operation and it has been forced to change as it has grown.<p>One of those changes was that it was forced to gather revenue to pay for the large amounts of bandwidth its thousands of communities use. A year ago the message board community clubbed together and between them raised the $1500 ezboard were asking for a years hosting. A year has gone by and renewal has come up again. This time the renewal comes in at nearly $5000, and I feel that the price they are asking is more than the service is worth. I have had discussions with ezboard, from which I have not received a satisfactory solution as of yet, and so our paid subscription has expired.<p>This means that for now, anyone visiting the messageboards will receive adverts, both in banner form and in pop-up form. There are ways to rid yourself of these annoyances, the best solution being to pay for your posting account to be registerered as 'ezsupporter' which costs $7 for 6 months or $12 for 12 months. As well as ridding yourself of the ads, your visits to the boards do not count towards the 'price' of purchasing gold status for the entire community.<p>I am going to leave it for a month. If in that time I can either get a more satisfactory solution from ezboard, or the cost of renewal has dropped (through less visits and more people buying ezsupporter) to a reasonable level then we will stay with ezboard, if not, then plan B will be to build and host my own message board server.</p>
