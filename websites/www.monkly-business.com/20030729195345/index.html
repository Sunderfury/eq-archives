few interesting tidbits in it. first -despite someone posting that a friend had done it - no force sensitive slots have been activated yet. 2nd player cities are in final implementation and should be on test in a few weeks, ALSO player mounts are almost done as well... you can read the whole thing <a href='http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=Development&message.id=187960'> Here</a> on SWG's messageboards.

Apparently only for 36 people or less but - going back to the less "massive" raid size is good imo- with the instancing, can we say multiple raids at once?

Lost Dungeons of Norrath - Raid Content
</p>
<p>
In designing Lost Dungeons of Norrath, we haven't forgotten about those who enjoy raiding. In addition to the multitude of rewarding single-group adventures, LDoN also includes exciting and challenging events targeted at six groups or less.
</p>
<p>
For the first time, raids take place in truly private zones, where your groups can test their mettle and focus solely on the task at hand. Instead of limiting the availability of content by who can get there first, this new system only limits participation based on whether or not you have recently succeeded or failed at each event within a given period. This allows us to place a heavy emphasis on skill, while remaining in control of the influx of new items into the game.
</p>
<p>
While our primary focus for LDoN is the single group experience, we are working diligently to ensure that these new raids are centered around the principles of organizational tactics, individual skill, and most importantly - fun. 
</p>
<p>
We feel that the core content and rewards in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion will entertain and benefit even the most experienced players. We are aware of the desire for high-end raid content and will continue to address and meet those needs over time.

Friday night the Torment Zone was taken down for a brief update. 
</p>
<p>
Hopefully this means that the bugged Saryrn Event is now working correctly instead of being bugged to the point where the players had to figure out a way around the bug. 
</p>
<p>
Hopefully SoE will be more forthcoming when events like this happen, and actually tell us -the player community- that an event is broken, and that they are fixing it asap. Nothing is worse than something being broken and there is nothing from SoE about it on their main pages about it being broken(it was broken from the last patch til the 25th.
</p>
<p>
If the bug still exists, send me an email and i will post a correction.

Experimentation happens when an event is buggy, people try to figure out why it goes boom so it can be fixed, Well the Bugged Saryrn Event is one of those things that has been bugging us. Players have found a workaround that SEEMS to work consistantly and not crash the zone. there are 2 implementations of the workaround:
</p>
<p>
Method 1
</p>
<p>
Do Not Kill The Birds As They Add Into The Event- crowd control them - root, mem charm kite, whatever, just don't kill ANY of them
</p>
<p>
Method 2
</p>
<p>
Kill All But ONE Bird From Each Wave- sorta self-explainitory.
</p>
<p>
Both of these methods seem to consistantly bypass the crashing bug - which btw is a memory corruption bug that SoE IS active hunting down to fix(thanks S.H.).
</p>
<p>
Thanks go out to the Hard working Players who figured out how to apparently prevent the crash The zone bug.

Activision and id Software have today announced that Doom 3's deathmatch mode will be playable for the first time at QuakeCon 2003 in Dallas next month. The annual multiplayer gaming event is being held at the Adam's Mark Hotel from August 14-17. 
</p>
<p>
"What better way to celebrate QuakeCon than to unveil to our fans a preview of Doom 3 multiplayer," said Todd Hollenshead, CEO, id Software. "While everyone knows that Doom 3 is the most terrifying and scary single player experience ever created, multiplayer delivers the intense competitive action that our fans can count on. It's a natural to debut the Doom 3 multiplayer experience at QuakeCon, the world's preeminent fan-based multiplayer gaming event." 
</p>
<p>
QuakeCon attendees will get to play four-player deathmatch games on a level co-developed by id Software and UK-based Splash Damage.
