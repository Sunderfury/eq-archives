<P>Feign Death, a skill Monks learn at 17th level is quite arguably one 
        of the best, if not the best, skills in the game. With this skill monks 
        can learn a technique called the "Feign Pull." This technique allows the 
        monk to split creature spawns up and bring them back one at a time to 
        their group to fight. This allows for more efficient battles and easier 
        pulling later after the spawn spot has been "spaced" properly. 
        <P>I will be explaining the details of this technique as best I can so 
        that my Brother &amp; Sister monks may learn from my knowledge. It 
        should also be noted that the necromancer and shadow knight also get 
        Feign Death, but as a spell and not a skill. The same technique can be 
        used by either of them, but I would advise against it as spells have 
        casting time, can fizzle, can be interrupted and can also fail just as 
        our skill can. 
        <P>I would also like to say that the Feign Pull is also an art form. Not 
        everyone can do it and not everyone can do it well. It takes skill, 
        timing, judgement, strategy and patience. As with all things, it also 
        takes lots of practice. While the principle of the technique will be the 
        same everywhere you use it, there will be little things you will have to 
        learn in each zone. Not every creature reacts the same, all areas will 
        not offers the same tactical advantages and creature pathing will not 
        always be the same. 
        <P>That being said I would now like to define some terms that I, myself, 
        or the monk community at large uses when speaking of the Feign Pull.

        <P>Now to explain how the technique is actually used; again, this is 
        based solely on my experiences and what has worked for me. 
        <P>
        <OL>
          <P>
          <LI>If you do not know the area you are hunting you need to go do some 
          scouting and learn the lay of the land. Learn what kind of creatures 
          live there, where they spawn, how often they spawn and where the 
          wanderers are. Learn all the twists, turns and land marks of the area. 
          Lots of this will just come with time and exploration. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Find a good spot for your group to hunt. This should be an area 
          with few to no wanders. Also the closer to the zone border you can be 
          the safer it is in case of an emergency. Many good hunting areas will 
          be far away form any zone so a monk's skill with Feign Pull will mean 
          the success or failure of a night's adventure. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Find a good spot far enough away from your group and the creatures 
          you are pulling to Feign. You don't want creatures close enough to 
          your group that they agro on them and you don't want to be close 
          enough to the creatures area you just pulled so they reagro on you. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Find the creatures you want to pull. You can use a thrown weapon 
          to attract their attention, you can run up and attack them hand to 
          hand or you can Agro Range pull them. Each method of pulling has it's 
          on advantage and disadvantage. It's up to the individual to figure out 
          what works best for them and what method works best in which areas. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>After you have some creatures angry with you run back to your 
          Feign spot, turn around where you can see them and Feign Death. If you 
          are successful the creatures will just stop attacking you and just 
          stand there for a little bit. The creatures will then start to leave 
          and go back to where they came from. They will usually do this one at 
          a time, but occasionally they will all leave at the same time. If they 
          all leave at once you will have to make judgement calls and use every 
          split second of distance between the creatures to further work to 
          space them more so with standing and re-Feigning. Sometimes you just 
          have to bring more than one, but if you are patient you can almost 
          always bring a single. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Once all creatures but one have left you stand up, attack the 
          creature and head back to your group. A hot key set up for a group say 
          "Incoming" is very useful. It allows your party to be ready for your 
          return and can also be used to let your group know how many creatures 
          you bringing back if you have more than one. Example: "Incoming, 
          Incoming, Incoming" when you are bringing three creatures back. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Help your group to kill the creature(s) you just pulled then check 
          with all casters so you know how much mana everyone has. You should 
          always check with your casters after every fight. If you run off and 
          bring more creatures and your only healer is only at 20% mana then you 
          could be in trouble. Don't rely on the casters to take initiative and 
          give you mana updates. You control the flow of the pulls so you should 
          always know how combat-ready your party is. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Now its time to pull again. Depending on how quickly you can sort 
          your pulls and how quickly your pull dies you may need to wait a few 
          min between battles to pull again. This is to allow you to "space" the 
          spawn time. If you are pulling a large area and several different 
          creature camps you will want to do this for ease of pulling later. 
          There is no need to have to Feign Pull every single time if you can 
          set the spawn time to allow you to pull a single as soon as a creature 
          spawns. </LI></OL>
        <P>That is the basics of the Feign Pull and should work well just as 
        described on all creatures below 35th level. Creatures 35th and above 
        behave differently to Feign Death so more patience and techniques have 
        to be brought into play to be successful. 
        <P><STRONG>Shorter Distance -</STRONG> In step 3 any distance far enough 
        away from the creatures area you pulled from is good, but not so at 
        higher levels (at least for better success rates that is). You will want 
        to shorten the distance you pull the creatures away from their spawn 
        spots, but you still need to pull them far enough away so that when you 
        have your single creature left that it does not re-agro his friends when 
        you pull him. The reason for the shorter distance is two-fold: it allows 
        you to see, sometimes hear, when a creature is back to its Home Point, 
        which in turn increases your chance of a Mem Wipe on these same 
        creatures. 
        <P><STRONG>Pop-N-Drop -</STRONG> This is a very useful technique and 
        also usually involves a bit more pain. It is used on Wanderers and for 
        Statics that you have pulled long distances. Each time you Pop-N-Drop 
        successfully it increases the chance of a Mem Wipe on the creatures you 
        pulled. This is also useful to Mem Wipe creatures when you are just 
        passing though an area and don't want or need to fight, but have 
        creatures go agro on you. The extra pain of this technique come into 
        play when you are trying to keep one creature with you to pull back to 
        your group, but still have to Mem Wipe all his friends. You have to 
        stand up long enough to find out if the others are coming back or not. 
        In turn you will be attacked by the one still with you. Once you are 
        sure you have Mem Wiped the others, call the "Incoming" and head back to 
        your group. 
        <P><STRONG>Chain Pull -</STRONG> A Chain Pull can be used on any and all 
        pulls, but is only necessary in certain situations or places. The main 
        time a Chain Pull is used is on the Planes or on difficult creatures 
        such as Imps and Giants in Sol B. This allows much harder creatures to 
        be pulled single and with as little injury as possible to the pullers. A 
        pair of monks is always best to do a Chain Pull, but anyone can be a 
        secondary puller. Also more than two people can be used to Chain Pull to 
        increase the pulling distance, but I will only explain the technique 
        used for two Monks. 
        <P>
        <UL>
          <OL>
            <LI>The secondary puller Feigns in a spot where the primary puller 
            will pull to and Feign. 
            <P></P>
            <LI>The primary puller goes out, pulls some creatures to where the 
            secondary puller is Feigned and then Feigns themselves. 
            <P></P>
            <LI>Just as with the basics of the Feign Pull, the secondary puller 
            waits for all but one creature to leave then brings the last one 
            back to the group(s). 
            <P></P>
            <LI>The secondary puller then goes back to his pulling position and 
            Feigns. 
            <P></P>
            <LI>The primary puller, lots of times, has only to stand to bring 
            creatures back to him as he has not done a Pop-N-Drop. He then 
            Feigns and the secondary puller repeats step 3 &amp; 4. 
            <P></P>
            <LI>When creatures no longer come when the primary puller stands he 
            then goes to pull again and the process is repeated. </LI></OL></UL>
        <P>
        <CENTER><STRONG>Tips:</STRONG></CENTER>
        <P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Always turn off your auto attack before you Feign 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Wait for an enemy casters spell to hit you before you Feign 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Use walls and line-of-sight to help split up multiple casters 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Teach your healers / buffer / bard when it's ok to cast on you. 
          Lots of times a Song, Heal or Buff cast on you right as or after you 
          feign can cause all the creatures on you to go after the caster of the 
          spell. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Make sure YOU are the only one pulling. Two pullers not working 
          together can cause lots of trouble. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Know what your group can handle. Sometimes it's OK to bring more 
          than one back. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Make sure you know everyone's mana status, especially Healers. 
          <P></P>
          <LI>Make sure your Healers know if you have Mend recycled or not. You 
          will have to use it sometimes on a pull that's not going well. 
</LI></UL>
        <P>I hope you find the information I have provided useful and that it 
        aids you in becoming a better puller. As the game evolves I will try to 
        keep any changes that affect the Feign Pull updated and corrected for 
        the proper and most efficient use of our skill.</p></FONT>
