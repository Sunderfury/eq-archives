Wow its completely NEW and upgraded....Tradeskills that is- I knew there was a reason why i have never done tradeskilling.
</p>
<p>
January and Beyond
</p>
<p>
We want to wish everyone a happy holiday season and thank you for continuing to be a part of EverQuest.  We have some exciting times ahead with our 7th expansion in the works, www.gatesofdiscord.com, and there are many more exciting things to come.  Here are a few of the new features on the EQ team's large and busy schedule.
</p>
<p>
Melee Enhancement, part 2
</p>
<p>
Melee classes are currently enjoying the first part of the improved Melee system and the feedback we are receiving has been great.  Early in 2004 we plan to move forward with the rest of the melee enhancement, the reaction abilities.  The enhancement gives Monks, Rogues and Warriors the ability to use special skills in response to a mistake made by their opponent or an exceptional move of their own.  This enhancement will be in addition to the existing system, allowing players to use the skills for more involved game-play and to improve the abilities of their characters.
</p>
<p>
A more detailed explanation and the transcript of a chat with the EQ Live team about the system can be found on the Developers Corner.
</p>
<p>
Graveyard Zone
</p>
<p>
Tired of losing your corpse?  The current EQ system removes corpses from the game after a week to reduce clutter and potential video lag.  But we know there are times when your character dies and you just can't get it right away.  Next thing you know a day turns into a week and BAM!  Your corpse is gone.  Since we can't leave the corpses sitting in game indefinitely, some inventive folks here have come up with another option.
</p>
<p>
We plan to create a "graveyard" zone that will only work if your corpse has decayed and disappeared.  If you have lost your corpse due to decay in other parts of Norrath, you will be allowed to enter this zone and reclaim it.
</p>
<p>
Tradeskill Interface Upgrade
</p>
<p>
Tired of all the clicking and dragging needed just to make a type 1 wood arrow?  We know that the current tradeskill interface is cumbersome, so the UI guys have come up with some new ideas.
</p>
<p>
Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface.  In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently available to you.  This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as some above it.  Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion.  Clicking the "combine" button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the results on the player's cursor.  The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
As long as the melee opening system is not "twitch" play, it could be good.

Eqlounge just posted a list of EVERY class available for EQ2 - all 47 of them.
</p>
<p>
I believe their breakdown of the class levels is incorrect with Moorgard saying a few months ago that the new "high" level was dropped to 50 from 100 and that corrospondingly the choice levels were also dropped from level 6 to like 4 15 to 10 and 30 to 20. 
</p>
<p>
I have Emailed Moorgard to verify my (vague) memory of the breakdown.
</p>
<p>
For your Perusement... <a href='http://www.eqlounge.com/racesandclasses/'>Complete EQ2 Class List Tree</a> 
</p>
<p>
From the article announcing this, they have said that Moorgard stated that beta should shortly follow the full revelation of the classes... sooo Keep your fingers Crossed. 
</p>
<p>
With WoW's Beta Delay, EQ2- Might- come out of the blocks - so to speak- before Blizzard's WoW. Let the Battle of the Behemoths Begin...

The Synarcana Raid Contest
</p>
<p>
We, the Wayfarer's Brotherhood have discovered that powerful magical energies of a scale never before experienced have been focused deep within Miragul's Menagerie. Rumors persist that this magic is far more potent than any seen before; so powerful that the magic has created a physical form for itself. Deep within the heart of the Menagerie dwells this creature of pure magical energy, a unique form of life we have dubbed the Synarcana. 
</p>
<p>
If left unchecked, the Synarcana could destroy all of Antonica and warp the very foundation of our reality. The Wayfarer's Brotherhood is seeking a band of adventurers brave and true to root out the Synarcana before it becomes even more powerful. We are in desperate need of your help to control the rising menace of this presence. 
</p>
<p>
Beyond simple fame and bragging rights, one of the living participants in the first raid to successfully complete this task shall be rewarded with a gift from the real world. Curt Schilling, World Series Co-MVP pitcher with the Arizona Diamondbacks (Officially now a member of the Boston Red Sox), is so impressed by the incredible challenge presented by the power of the Synarcana, that he has pledged to grant a single signed jersey to one of the living participants of the first raid to topple the Synarcana. 
</p>
<p>
Do you have what it takes to destroy the mystical menace of the Synarcana? Be the first to do so and win Curt Schilling's jersey. 
</p>
<p>
The challenge officially begins Sunday, December 28, 2003, 5:00PM, Pacific Time. Our logs will determine who completes this challenge. The raid must be completed inside the time limit, and not during the 30 minutes after the raid is "over." 
</p>
<p>
Good luck!
</ul>

For the wow Fanatics that are drooling in anticipation....Hopefully Q1 2004.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
Over the past few weeks, it has become apparent that the World of Warcraft beta will not be available within the fourth quarter of 2003. The development team is currently hard at work testing the alpha version of the game, and we look forward to bringing you an outstanding beta in early 2004. 
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to always make the best games possible, and a critical part of the development process includes the public beta test. This means that we will not release the final product or any other component of the game until it's ready. Rather than release an inferior candidate to meet a specific date, we have chosen to further test World of Warcraft internally until we feel the game will allow for a productive beta test. 
</p>
<p>
Announcements concerning the beta test, along with additional details about the game, will be released in the near future. We encourage you to check our official Web site www.blizzard.com/wow for further updates. Thank you for your continued support and patience. 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Once I find out when beta will start/applications start to be taken, I'll Let you know.

Our Operations and Development teams are aware of the current stability issues and they are working, as you read this, to resolve them.  In an effort to resolve this issue, the servers will be coming down at 3AM PST for an update on December 23rd.  We extend our apologies for this ongoing issue and thank you for your patience while we resolve these problems.

Wife has been sick(nothing serious, just side effects from day procedure-had to have fluid drained from her abdomen several times- ick- the good news is, we found out she is expecting sooo while it being a pain in the ass, with the good news we are bearing it well) so i haven't been on to update the news as often as i wished too- like since thursday.
</p>
<p>
Ok on the 28th, SoE implemented the first stage of the Melee revision, starting with the Disciplines. during the days since we have found several things that needed to be addressed and apparently the alterations have been made on Test for the next patch (he 23rd). also there seemed to be a problem with disc timers and amd cpu's, but again i believe this problem is fixed on test as well.
</p>
<p>
So far the General Feedback (except for the above mentioned problems) has been good for the disc implementation. I like what was done personally.
</p>
<p>
also on the 18th, 19th, & 20th  WHATEVER they did, something is definately screwy with the servers overall, there have been several "emergency" downtimes to try to fix the issues, But 1017 errors are rampant, and people are crashing on zoning, dying, logging in, etc. i am doing the news right now due to the fact that although i have all the files upto date, i absolutely cannot log into EQ. SoE blames the casino on alot of the initial problems but unfortunately, it seems this was not entirely the problem. hopefully they will fix it ASAP.
</p>
<p>
For those wanting to not preorder GoD. eqclient.ini, find the lastview for GoD and change the beginning 10 to 11.
