    <P><B>Introduction:</B> </P>
    
    <P>I'm currently a level 35 monk on Drinal. I gained 15 levels while in
      High Keep, made some decent pp, many friends and learned many things about
      grouping. I feel I know the area very well, though many things I can't put
      into words because they are simply learned instinct while down here. Spend
      enough time down here and it will come to you as well. While written from
      a monk perspective, I hope this guide can help others who read it. Also,
      my skill with Paint is non - existent, so my maps will almost certainly
      look primitive and slightly inaccurate. I recommend EQAtlas if you need a
      more detailed map. More than anything else, this is a guide for people who
      are low level and don't have experience grouping with others. With this I
      hope you can begin to learn about group dynamics without having to make a
      whole mess of trial and error mistakes that could get you, your friends or
      any other people killed. This is the first revision. I intend to improve
      upon this in the future. Please forward corrections and suggestions to
      descolada@hotmail.com </P>
    
    <P><B>High Keep</B></P>
    
    <P>High Keep is an interesting place in many ways. First, it's a city area,
      so anyone can bind anywhere in the zone. Second, it has vendors and a
      bank, which means that monks can get loot, sell it, and bank it
      conveniently all in one zone. Third, it's low level (20 - 35 on average,
      with occasional disliked soloists camping RR to 42 I've heard) so it is a
      great place to learn basic group skills. It's a popular zone on Drinal
      with normally 10 - 25 people inside most of the time, so finding a group
      isn't that hard, though during peak times it will be hard because people
      will already have full groups and be putting people on list. I've run
      groups with up to ten people on list at times. </P>
    
    <P>The loot is weak at first (rusty weapons, bags), but once you move on
      beyond the main room fine steel weapons, high quality ore and small bronze
      armor will drop. All mobs can drop Left Goblin Ears as well, which can be
      given to Captain Bosec for small experience and faction adjustment - these
      can be sold much like Deathfist Slashed Belts in East Commonlands, as they
      give Freeport faction. The high quality ore fetches a good price with
      vendors, but will fetch a better price with high-level smiths looking for
      supplies. Amstaf's Scroll drops here as well, an item required for the
      Paladin Ghoulbane quest. As these are no drop, there are frequently zone
      shouts when one drops in case someone is looking for it. Common practice
      here is to designate a group master looter. </P>
    
    <P>The basement is a small area with four rooms that can be camped - the
      lookout room (LR), the main room (MR), the warrior room (WR), and the
      raider room (RR). WR is most frequently camped, with MR being second
      place, LR being third, and RR being the least commonly camped, mainly
      because WR will often pull RR as well and there will rarely be anyone
      interested in forming an RR group. The rooms are named for their most
      common spawns. </P>
    
    <P>First things first: The guards will help you with trains, yes. But a
      much better train derailer is Ran Flamespinner, an NPC caster with
      hand-to-hand skills that put most monks to shame. He's in a room directly
      above the bank, accessible through a door on the east wall above right
      above the stairs to the bank. If the train has enough mobs in it and
      you're too low on health you might want to zone instead of risking one
      killing you while Ran goes on his rampage, but if your health is really
      that low then you're probably not going to be able to run fast enough to
      the zone line anyway. Once again, do not depend on the guards. I've seen
      Captain Bosec and several guards go down before a massive train was
      destroyed. Before doing anything, make sure you're aware of the bank's
      position. Then get bound there, and double check you really are bound
      there. Not only do long corpse runs suck in general, but if your party is
      in enough trouble that you die you want to be able to help them as fast as
      possible if they haven't trained the mobs yet. </P>
    
    <P>First thing you should do is call for a camp check. Most likely anyone
      camping WR will say RR as well. If you're high enough, try to get to the
      WR groups. I personally don't recommend joining a MR group and then
      leaving if WR has an opening, though - I know I wouldn't like being
      abandoned if I was in the MR group. For the Iksar and other KOS races,
      killing goblins will only improve faction with Rivervale and King Xorbb.
      If you wish to improve High Keep and Freeport faction you have to turn in
      goblin ears. As a monk, there are several things you'll need to remember
      and learn if you don't know them yet. Make sure the healers know about
      your mend ability and when they should and shouldn't heal you. I'll either
      tell them to not heal me until I'm half health or will state in battle if
      I have mend at certain points, along with a message to either heal or hold
      heals. </P>
    
    <P>Feint death to switch aggro to tanks if you're getting whipped and
      they're fighting with full health. Never, ever use instill doubt down
      here. Learn to watch for the enchanter's mez messages and don't break
      mezzes immediately after a mob goes down unless instructed to or if
      someone else does, as a few seconds for casters to med or cast debuffs can
      help in the upcoming battle. Watch your casters carefully in case they're
      attacked. At early levels many melee types are not attentive to adds and
      many casters aren't attentive to aggro levels. Make mana checks before
      pulling. Keep track of your buffs and ask for them if needed. </P>
    
    <P>Try to attack the same target at all times, though if you spot a caster
      don't be afraid to call for a switch of targets. Alert the suicidal
      warrior he's near death and pull the mob off him when he wants to die with
      honor. Many things like this are important to remember. I'm sure many of
      you know things like this already, but many people still don't and won't
      learn them until bad things happen as a result of their actions. Keep
      basic tactics like these in mind while fighting if you don't know them
      yet, as they do help in the long run. </P>
    
    <P><B>Lookout Room (LR) </B></P> <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
      <TR>
        <TD HEIGHT="205" ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="328"><IMG SRC="http://www.monkly-business.com/bodi/images/fig_a.jpg" WIDTH="279" HEIGHT="214"></TD>
        <TD HEIGHT="205" WIDTH="380">The Lookout room is small room adjacent to
        the main room. It isn't frequently camped, and if it isn't then MR is
        usually pulling it. It has three spawn points. A and B can spawn a
        Pickclaw Lookout or a Pickclaw Cabalists. </TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    <p>Lookouts range from 22 - 24,
        and cabalists from 23 - 25. Casters are recommended to be killed first,
        as they can dot, nuke, slow and heal. Point C will spawn a Crazed
        Goblin, a Goblin Thief or a Goblin, all of which (at least in this room)
         can be from 18 - 25. These will drop Amstaf's Scroll occasionally.
        
    <P>The room is a slow spawn, and it is easily camped by a few early
      twenties players. A full group will not be necessary, but be warned that a
      running mob might aggro mobs in MR if they're not pulled yet. Rooting is
      helpful, but not necessary during normal hours. The room itself is large
      enough so that you can fight mobs at A and B or at C without pulling those
      at the other end if everyone is close enough to the east or west end of
      the room. A mob running from C might pull the others as it leaves, though
      this is more dependent on the positions of group members running after it.
      A mob running from A or B will definitely pull the mob at C. Breaking this
      is quick and painless. If you're careful you should be able to kill C
      without aggroing A and B. There is no choice but to take A and B at the
      same time. </P>
    
    <P><B>Main Room (MR) </B></P>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
      <TR>
        <TD HEIGHT="153" WIDTH="333" ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="http://www.monkly-business.com/bodi/images/fig_b.jpg" WIDTH="279" HEIGHT="214"></TD>
        <TD HEIGHT="153" WIDTH="385">The Main room is more interesting, and
        requires more careful camp placement than any of the other rooms if you
        wish to selectively pull from points.  </TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    <p>Spawn time isn't different from LR
        (I'm sure everything spawns at a set rate but I've never bothered, nor
        needed to time it), but because there are so many more points where you
        will pull from as well as generally higher level mobs this room is quite
        a step up from LR. Often LR isn't camped anyway, so a good MR group can
        pull from there too.
    <P>A full group is a necessity at the lower levels, or at least an
      excellent healer or enchanter. All points, except B, can spawn a Pickclaw
      Guard, a Pickclaw Lookout, a Pickclaw Cabalist and a Pickclaw Spiritist.
      Point B is another Goblin/Thief/Crazed like C in LR. Guards can be level
      26 max, and will usually be higher level than lookouts. Also, from this
      point on, some higher-level casters can use an aoe effect spell that hits
      in three waves. You'll learn to recognize it after being hit by it once.
      If you see it happen, back away - the range isn't that wide and you can
      usually avoid the last two hits. From what I've seen the mobs on the north
      wall tend to be lower level than those farther south, though this is not
      always the case. </P>
    
    <P>Always, always, ALWAYS set camp at point 1. Everyone should hug the wall
      here - it's the safest place in the room, and nothing will aggro you if
      you sit snuggly against the wall here. Groups will almost always be here
      already, but in case they aren't, make sure they move themselves. Try to
      fight as close to this camp as possible, as it will keep from pulling
      other points if they pop. Point B will be pulled by any movement in the
      center of the room, point D will often pull point C, and Point D will
      frequently, but not always pull point B (when pulling from WR or below). A
      and E are unique in that they are far enough away so the other three
      points can be easily engaged without pulling them until a mob runs close
      by. Keep an eye on those points though, as LR can pull them accidentally
      when one of their mobs runs through the door. Point E can be pulled when
      someone walks down the stairs into the basement as well, and sometimes
      purposefully by people at the foot of the stairs (the common camp site for
      people breaking MR). </P>
    
    <P>The pathing here deserves special mention, as it is particularly odd. A
      mob will often run clockwise around the room before attacking you if you
      attack it up close and then run too far from it. This WILL aggro any other
      pops in the room. Prevent this by not backing away from the mob too
      quickly - slow movement on part of the puller will override bad pathing.
      Also, if a caster at the campsite gains too much aggro the mob will take a
      very roundabout route to attack them, either coming from the south or
      north behind the pillars as the arrows show. No need to chase the mob to
      its final destination, after all - just head straight to the caster and
      wait. Once again, this will aggro any mobs not pulled, though at this
      point it would only be A or E that might be pulled. E is the most common
      add due to this bad pathing, as people often don't notice it has popped.
    </P>
    
    <P>I may in the future add more detail to the pathing information of this
      room since it has been a while since I've camped MR and do not remember
      all the details. Since this is the first room entered, it is the first one
      that needs to be broken if you intend to go lower and there isn't a group
      already camping it. You can split mobs with feign pull and bring them to
      the area above the stairs if your group cannot handle several at once, or
      you can simply aggro all the mobs in the room and train them to Ran
      Flamespinner. </P>
    
    <P><B>Warrior Room (WR) </B></P> <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
      <TR>
        <TD WIDTH="299" HEIGHT="110" ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="http://www.monkly-business.com/bodi/images/fig_c.jpg" WIDTH="279" HEIGHT="214"></TD>
        <TD WIDTH="404" HEIGHT="110">The warrior room is not quite as dependant
        on careful campsites or making sure group members don't do anything
        rash. </TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    <p>Spawns at any points except F can be a Pickclaw Guard, a Pickclaw
        Warrior, a Pickclaw Cabalist, a Pickclaw Spiritist, or a Pickclaw
        Visionary. Point F is another Goblin/Thief/Crazed spawn point. Warriors
        can go as high as 33, so things will be significantly tougher here than
        in MR. Fine steel will now drop as well as bronze and high quality ore,
        so here and the raider room is where the best potential is to make money
        in High Keep Pulling strategy is much more simple in WR. 
    <P>The three mobs at points C, D and E will have to be dealt with no matter
      what when camping this room, as the room is small and the camp will be
      instantly aggroed. A and B are generally considered to be part of WR, but
      if for some reason WR is not strong enough to pull them MR can. A will be
      pulled if someone or a mob leaves the room, and B will sometimes follow
      suit, depending on how far any fleeing mobs or wandering person gets. F is
      more technically a RR point, but since RR is rarely camped itself I
      include it here. Just move slightly into the north hallway and the mob
      will eventually run to you. Always pull A and F inside the WR room, as it
      increases the amount of time a mob has to run to pull B. B can be
      completely ignored in fact until someone has to go upstairs. </P>
    
    <P>Be warned though - if B is a caster pop it will heal any mobs fighting
      in WR, though it will not be aggroed. Of special mention are the wall
      glitches in this room. If a mob is fighting too close to a wall it may
      despawn before being killed. Spells that push back a mob will contribute
      to this potential risk. Also, people that die too close to the walls can
      sometimes not see or find their corpses, though other people often can.
      The simplest solution to all these headaches is that if you fight a mob,
      fight it as close to the center of the room as possible and if you must
      die, die as close to the center of the room as possible. Breaking this
      area doesn't require much strategy. </P>
    
    <P>You can fight A and B at the same time on the stairs, fight C, D and E
      in the room or split any number of them to bring back to a temporary camp
      in MR or farther back. You can also train them to Ran Flamespinner, but
      this risks accidentally aggroing mobs onto a MR group, something they will
      not like at all. </P>
    
    <P><B>Raider Room (RR) </B></P>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
      <TR>
        <TD WIDTH="286" HEIGHT="113"><IMG SRC="http://www.monkly-business.com/bodi/images/fig_d.jpg" WIDTH="279" HEIGHT="214"></TD>
        <TD WIDTH="421" HEIGHT="113">I have never actually camped the raider
        room; I have pulled the raider room only when camping WR, and when given
        the choice between a camp in WR or RR I heartily recommend WR, as it has
        five good spawn points as opposed to RR's three. </TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    <p>Anyway, like RR, WR has
        no complicated tactics required to camp it. Some people will establish a
        camp in the hall near A, but this isn't really helpful unless you want
        to pull spawn from RR and KNOW that another will pop very soon after.
        And heck, if you've got a strong enough group to take on a Pickclaw
        Raider, then you can probably stick to the room itself with only a
        slightly increased chance of failure. 
    <P>Spawns for B, C and D can be any of the types that spawn in RR as well
      as a Pickclaw Raider (which, from what I've seen, tend to be lower level
      than most warriors) or a Pickclaw Seer. A is the same as point F in the
      map of WR. WR pulling RR: Okay, so you're in a WR camp and your group is
      on a roll. Everyone's in good spirits, and then someone says, "Let's
      pull RR!" Here's where you can get to practice FD splitting for the
      first time if you never have before. Remember you don't want to bring a
      mob into the room when your group is fighting or when one is about to pop,
      of course. Either keep in mind how long it's been since you've had pops or
      make sure your enchanter is at full mana. I often had people (usually a
      warrior) tell me, "Why split them? Just bring them all, we have an
      enchanter." It's fairly obvious why you shouldn't - because the room
      you're in has three spawn points, and there's a very good chance one will
      pop while you're dealing with the two to four mobs you'll get when pulling
      RR. </P>
    
    <P>I prefer to keep the enchanter's talents reserved for pops in the room
      itself when splitting RR, as it alleviates the need to time the pops
      carefully. First thing you should do is pull the Goblin/Thief/Crazed mob
      at point A/F if it's up. After your group makes short work of this, alert
      them you'll be pulling RR and to STAY THE HECK AWAY from the hallway and
      in WR. Once again, it should be common sense but I've had group members
      wander by and mess up when I'm in mid pull. Also make sure no one is going
      to cast anything on you or play bard songs. I prefer to FD right at point
      1 on the WR map. </P>
    
    <P>Careful you don't FD before a spell hits you, which will break the
      feint. I've noted that a single mob will often stop at point 2 after you
      pull from RR, which will make pulling again much easier. If a mob pops
      while you're pulling, do NOT rush back to assist unless you alert them and
      have an enchanter or a powerful group to deal with the consequences. If
      it's one mob versus five or four versus six, I think it's obvious what the
      group would want. Be warned that once you pull mobs into the hallway that
      leads into WR they will quite possibly run into WR if you faint, attack
      group members, so point 1 is essentially the limit on how far you have to
      split them. Be patient when splitting, as even if the other mobs have
      rounded the corner they may still rush back when you stand. </P>
    
    <P>If you happen to pull a caster from anywhere in the dungeon and will
      make it back to the WR well before they do, stand at point 3 - casters
      require line of sight to cast on you, so this will ensure that they come
      inside the room before casting any spells. In fact I would always stand
      here when pulling into WR, as it would position the mob(s) in an excellent
      position where they could be attacked from all sides easily and would not
      be in danger of despawning due to the wall glitch. It will take practice,
      but it was the first chance I had to practice splitting mobs and I think
      it is an excellent place for any new monks to learn it for themselves.
      There is no other place in this area that feign puling is necessary or
      helpful except breaking MR. </P>
    
    <P><B>Final Notes: </B></P>
    
    <P>This place can get crowded. Lists can get long, so try to come before or
      after peak hours hit so you can get in on a group. Be wary of an
      aggressive MR group taking the WR spawns at point A and B, particularly B.
      I've had to stand guard to make sure this doesn't happen. Shout when
      Amstaf's Scroll drops, as the questing Paladins don't always make
      themselves known. It's depressing how many times I've seen it rot after a
      Paladin was here for five hours, asking in /ooc if it had dropped yet. A
      group that stays late enough can camp the whole basement, something I've
      found to be very fun and rewarding, so if you have the time try to see how
      long you can make a group last. Make use of the knowledge of the aggro
      range from certain points when pulling the whole basement to WR - Three
      lookouts is cake, but three guards, two cabalists and a lookout can cause
      unnecessary trouble when you could have pulled them in twos or threes.
