Looks like for an additional ~35 bucks you can go with the EQ group to the Cubs game at Wrigley Field. its in the planning stages now but it'll probably be friday or sunday. if more than 1000 people go one of the EQ players that go will toss out the first ball.

Just so you all know it took me all of 15 minutes to register for the fan faire, get plane tickets and the hotel room, all over the 'net without resorting to a phone. the Fan Faire hotel info page has a dedicated page setup to get the fan faire rate for the hotel (which is like 90 less a night than you can get elsewhere) and expedia worked great. totals $89 - fan faire registration $223.50 plane tickets, $327+ tax for the hotel.

Blizzard Entertainment has today announced that Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne has gone gold and is currently being prepared for release on July 1. The first expansion pack for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, The Frozen Throne adds numerous new features to the game, including four new single-player campaigns, four new race-specific heroes, five neutral heroes, two new units per race, new neutral buildings, new multiplayer maps, and lots more. 
</p>
<p>
"We're very excited to announce that development on Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne has been completed," said Mike Morhaime, Blizzard Entertainment president and cofounder. "When we set out to create the next installment of the Warcraft series, we wanted to increase the strategic gameplay possibilities and depth of the Warcraft universe by introducing a wide array of new heroes and units specifically designed to enhance each race. We're extremely proud of these new additions, and we look forward to sharing them with players."

The 21.99 rate for all SoE games(swg excluded) is now live and you can switch over if you want to on the <a href='http://www.station.sony.com/allaccess/'>All Access Page</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Personally i am going to wait until EQ2 is almost out before i do the switch over - first because i paid back when they offered prepay for 2 years, i did, and second, i have yet to pick up any other SoE product besides EQ.

The Shadowbane service came under serious attack tonight. Wolfpack Studios and ubi.com have been called in and we will be investigating these incidents all through the night tonight.

<p>
As a precautionary measure, all the game servers will be brought down during the next 30 minutes for some emergency maintenance. We will be bringing worlds back online one at a time, so we expect this entire process to last a minimum of two to six hours.

You know, I have not covered much of SB since it was released, mostly because nothing interesting has happened there really, its a very minor success but hasn't had much if any impact on the current eq subscription base.

<p>
Well now I DO have some news, apparently a guild hacked into a shadowbane server the other night gave themselves basically god mode and wreaked havoc on said server making npc cities kos to all, looting all players, etc.

I am still looking more into the validity of this information and when I have further details I'll relay it along.

<p>
** Experience System Change - Grouping **
</p>
<p>
We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in all of EverQuest.  At its core, the idea is to positively reinforce grouping.  There should never be any penalty to adding "that sixth person over there," whatever class they may be, into your group.  That is exactly the type of behavior that should be rewarded.
</p>
<p>
In a massively multi-player game, any mechanic that penalizes those who group is one that we need to take a serious look at.  While there are definite benefits to forming "well balanced" groups in terms of damage, tanking, healing, and support, there shouldn't be an active penalty to those who cannot find groups of "optimal" balance.
</p>
<p>
As it stands in EverQuest, groups gain a 2% to 20% experience bonus, which we refer to as the "group bonus", for having two to six members.  In practice, however, this has never been much of a bonus, even in the case of a full group, given that the experience was already being divided six ways.
</p>
<p>
In the past, we had also attempted to reward people for adventuring in the more challenging Planes of Power zones by making those zones give a better rate of experience.
</p>
<p>
As of this update, groups now gain 20% to 80% "group bonus" experience for having two to five members.  
</p>
<p>
Full, six-person, groups now see an additional bonus.  Their experience is only divided five ways, yet they still gain the 80% "group bonus."  For those who think in terms of pie charts, it amounts to a larger piece of a larger pie.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be decreased slightly.  However, as long as person is grouped with at least one other, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system.  The one down side to the new system is that there will be a slight decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones.
</p>
<p>
We realize that we are, essentially, "manufacturing" a new type of experience after a kill.  As players, we also understand it is the people who spend time in full groups who have to deal with the most interruptions and setup time caused by organizing the extra people.  It simply makes sense to reward that extra time, especially if it means bringing more people together.  After all, that's the whole point.
</p>
<p>
We look forward to seeing how these changes play out on Test Server.
</p>
<p>
<b>
** Experience System Change - Level 60+ **
</p>
<p>
In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels that give a person experience after they reach level 60.   The "blue to 65" range has been increased as far as level 50, with the "light blue" range extending to level 45.  The best benefits, however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. 
</p>
<p>
The world of EverQuest, at this point in its history, is truly immense and full of the best and most interesting content and visuals out there.  Ideally, when a person logs on they should have a wide array of places in which to adventure.  The addition of new content shouldn't entirely obsolete what already exists.  Hopefully these changes will once again make that the case.

From Gamespot:
</p>
<p>
Blizzard has announced that the development schedule for Starcraft: Ghost has been extended past the end of the 2003 to meet the team's goals and "deliver the outstanding gameplay experience our customers have come to expect from Blizzard products." The game is now scheduled for 2004, and Blizzard says it believes "that this additional development time will prove invaluable, ensuring that the game will truly expand on the legendary gameplay experience found in the previous Starcraft titles." The Blizzard statement further said that the developer "will not release the game until it's ready."

Ebworld has the next expansion of EQ named - yup you guessed it- Lost Dungeons of Norrath. Sony also has lostdungeonsofnorrath.com registered now, they didn't before. 
</p>
<p>
There is a Rumor around that they will implement "instancing" for the higher level dungeons and content so that the main complaint that players have is a lack of spawn due to competition. Instancing is you have a dungeon you enter, everyone in your "raid" goes into the dungeon. if raid number 2 enters the dungeon, they have a whole NEW zone to enter - one without raid 1. i know for a fact they are planning on eq2 having instancing, so i bet it being in LDoN will be the "beta" testing for it. people start logging onto test fairly often, hopefully SoE will use the test server community to test LDoN.
