          <p class="MB_SubHead">10th Coldain Ring War Guide by Azathool - Part one</p>
          <ul>
            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              <p>I've done the 10th ring war many times now, including my own. Most have been successes, some have been failures. From these I thought I'd write up a guide on how to run the 10th war. 

<p>It's not like I'm giving away any secrets. Nowadays any reasonable tier 2 guild can do a 10th ring war, so hopefully I'm saving a little heartache and reducing the chance of failing a war, so saving you and your guild time, and saving causing grief to others who want to use GD/Thurg.

<p>In the official guides section there is already a guide for the 9th ring <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=108">HERE</a>, at the bottom of which is a very short section on the 10th ring. It's wrong on a number of points. 
<p><b> PREPARATION:</b>
<p>For this War you need the following.

<p><u>1.9th Coldain Ring. </u>
<p>Please read the guides elsewhere on the MB boards on how to get this.

<p><u>2. Declaration of War.</u>
<p>This is obtained by handing your Dirk of the Dain (the uncorrupted one from 9th ring) to the Dain, and following the text. You should never destroy your Dirk of the Dain, as if you lose the war you can get a fresh Declaration and try again. Normally it's best to get your declaration upon getting your 9th ring if possible and keep it in the bank ready for the day, because as sure as night follows day you can bet someone will have killed the Dain the day before you want to trigger it.

<p><u>3. Enough force to do the war. </u>
<p>I'd suggest a minimum of 5 groups of 60th level fairly well equipped people. You should be very comfortable with killing Vindi, and also as far as possible a "raid accomplished" force so able to follow commands, know how to buff, etc etc.  We've done it with 4 groups before, and it was damn hard and very close with deaths almost every wave. With 6 groups we walk the encounter.

<p>If your own guild is not strong/big enough to do the war, you can always enter into an agreement with an allied guild, with the promise of future reciprocal help, or of a share in end loot.

<p>This is of course "official" groups. You will always get several individuals "helping" out. Whilst it's probably best to not directly encourage them as they only add to lag, don't piss them off. They ARE trying to be helpful after all. However it's really a 50+ level encounter only. Level 30's tend to get squashed to mobs that hit for 200.

<p><u>4. Sentry Badain up in GD. </u>
He's in the West side "hut" (hill.. whatever.. I'll call them huts here) beside the river near Thurg.

<p><u>5. Time. </u>
The War normally lasts "a good" 2 hours. Make sure your guild has time to do it. You don't want people logging off half way through.

<p><u>6. Beer</u>
Lots of beer for afterwards, or someone with Beer Goggles. Nothing like getting sloshed after a major War.

<p>Gather your forces in GD in between the two "huts" near Badain. This will be your meeting point, buff station and rez station from now on. * (NB. See note on KOS people). Some people put it further back nearer the falls, but there is no need, as giants are easily interceptible at this spot, giving you time to catch "runners" before they reach Thurg. It's also a nice spot because you can use the dwarfs there if necessary to help kill runners.

<p>Make sure you warn the zone for a good 30 minutes before hand what is going to happen in both ooc and shout and give warnings every 5 minutes.

<p>When the war is triggered, ALL mobs in the zone de-pop, the Nexus scion de-pops (ie, no port up, although you can still port down), and very soon a large proportion of the zone will be over run with lvl 50+ giants. Give people time to finish their camps, port out (or up to Luclin). I'd suggest you time the start with the 2nd port up of the Nexus portal. This gives people 2 chances to escape the zone via TP.

<p>The Velks area and the druid/wiz ring are safe areas, and no giants go there.

<p>Make sure you have a wizard with shards at the buff station ready to TL people out for free if necessary, and I'd also have a click stick cleric ready to rez any unfortunates who "get in the way accidentally". You will get good "press" for doing so.

<p>The reply to people who want to help "on the fly" should be "Be careful and don't die, don't agro the dwarfs. Don't expect heals/buffs, and rezes will be given out when we have time."

<p>Also expect a good number of faction taggers, and scavengers to turn up. Faction taggers run around hitting every mob for faction. Scavengers hang around hoping to loot the swords and axe's off the giants to sell for some pp. There is little you can do to prevent this, and I'd suggest you don't get angry about it. If they die, drag them to the middle and tell them they will be rezed AT THE END.

<p><b> LAG</b>
<p>One thing you need to be aware of is the lag.

<p>When the war is running you can have 50+ people running around in a fairly small area with 10 odd giants, and sometimes 10-20 dwarfs as well. Not only do you get video lag (slow frame rate), you also get data overload lag (data flooding).

<p>Any "lag prevention" measures you can take are best taken early. Turn off anything you don't need, and set your clip plane appropriately. Make sure critical people are not those always going LD when there are more than 15 people in the same place. You really don't want the MA on Narandi to go LD half way through.

<p>The worst lag occurs during the Narandi fight, so again be prepared for it, esp the clerics and MA.

<p><b> TRIGGERING</b>

<p>When you are all ready, hand the Declaration of War and your 9th Ring to Sentry Badain in the West side hut. 
<p><ul> <i> 
<20:15:44> Sentry Badain Breathes deeply and blows into an ornate horn. The sound  echos through the mountain pass. All local inhabitants scurry to take cover.

<p><20:15:44> Sentry Badain says 'I'll be right with you, Azathool.'
</i></ul>
<p>You will get your 9th Ring back. At this point the Nexus scion will de-pop along with all zone mobs !. So make sure the zone knows your about to do it.

<p>Your sure to get someone who was not listening and in the middle of a fight their mob de-pops and do a WTF ? Well. That's not your problem.

<p>If you now walk out of the hut and towards Thurg, and cross the river about half way there a ring of "Hero Dwarfs" will spawn.

<p>Wait and listen to them talking... This text can take quite a while (~10 mins).
<p><ul> <i> 
<20:16:40> Sentry Badain says 'Excellent! All of your commanders have reported to  the Dain, and none too soon mind you. We are getting reports of Kromrif troop movement in the  area and final preparations must be made. Follow me and the Seneschal will brief you.'

<p><20:16:58> Kargin the Archer 's stomach growls loudly.

<p><20:17:33> Garadain Glacierbane says 'With all due respect, Seneschal, I feel my  men are best suited for the eastern post. If the outlander has rounded up enough soldiers to hold  'em off from the south then they'll definitely test us in the gorge. We'll be needin' a solid  defense there.'

<p><20:17:44> Seneschal Aldikar says 'Very well, Garadain, the eastern post is  yours. I'll place Kargin and his bowmen on the hill to the west, and Churn, you'll station your  troops up near the caves just past them.'

<p><20:17:48> Churn the Axeman says 'Understood sir.'

<p><20:17:51> Sentry Badain says 'Excuse me, Seneschal Aldikar, you instructed me to  report to you when the outlander returned. I have brought him.'

<p><20:18:38> Seneschal Aldikar says 'Perfect timing outlander, please be seated and  listen carefully. Badain, yer dismissed.'

<p><20:20:13> Sentry Badain says 'Sir, yessir!'

<p><20:21:00> Seneschal Aldikar says 'We knew the day might come when the Kromrif  would discover the location of our beloved city. It was only prudent for there to be a plan for  such a circumstance. In light of recent developments, however, our plans have been adjusted.  Outlander, the Dain has appointed you to lead our armies in defense of Thurgadin.'

<p><20:21:47> Seneschal Aldikar says 'I will stand here with a handful of men as a  final line of defense. Should I fall, all will be lost. You will have these men and their  soldiers to command. Use them wisely, you will be richly rewarded if your forces are able to keep  them alive.'

<p><20:22:34> Seneschal Aldikar says 'Garadain will post his men in the gorge to the  east. Churn and his men will await your command in the caves to the west. Dobbin will have his  forces at the ready in the clearing directly south of here near the towers. If any Kromrif make  it to his vicinity he and his men will attack with or without your command.'

<p><20:23:21> Seneschal Aldikar says 'Lastly, Corbin will hide his men in the worm  caves to the south, call on him for a surprise attack. Remember where these men are stationed,  outlander. Should they call out for help you may wish to send some of your people to aid them.'

<p><20:24:09> Seneschal Aldikar says 'The leader of this invasion is a powerful  Kromrif named Narandi. Rumor has it that he is more powerful than any ten of his peers. He must  fall. When he is slain you must show his head and the ninth ring to me.'
</i></ul>
<p>Eventually Seneshal Aldikar will ask for your Ring.
<p><ul> <i> 
<20:24:56> Seneschal Aldikar says 'Scout Zrelik here will follow you and serve as  your herald. He will relay your orders to the troops. Show me your ninth ring now to verify your  identity and I will give you the orders to memorize.'
</i></ul>
<p>Give him your 9th Ring, and you will get it back along with a note. This contains instructions on how to command the dwarfs.
<p><ul> <i> 
<20:25:02> Seneschal Aldikar says 'Commit these orders to memory, Azathool, have  them ready to speak at a moment's notice. When you are finished memorizing, repeat them to me.  Tell your soldiers to prepare themselves. When the orders are handed to Zrelik we will take up  our positions.'
</i></ul>
<p>Write down the commands (if you want to..), and then hand the instruction note to Zrelik the Scout. You have a maximum time limit to hand in the note to Zrelik, so don't take too long.
<p><ul> <i> 
** Seneschal Aldikar says 'Outlander, the enemy approaches. If you do not hand Zrelik the orders you will not be able to command the Coldain armies. You have one minute remaining.

<p><20:29:08> Zrelik the Scout says 'At yer service, Azathool. Remember now, before  issuing me an order ya must disengage from any combat and be sure yer speakin to me. I advise yo  to avoid combat at all costs, your leadership is crucial.'
</i></ul>
<p>At this point Zrelik the Scout becomes your "pet" and the War itself is triggered. Within a few minutes the dwarf armies will spawn, and the first wave of giants will spawn.

<p>The following shouting match should occur, but personally I've never seen it. One of the many quest bugs I guess.

<p><ul> <i> 
Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Good citizens of Thurgadin, hear me! Our city, our people, our very lives are in danger this day. The Kromrif are at this very moment marching towards us in an offensive they hope will bring about our demise... 

<p>Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'I hereby command, by authority of Dain Frostreaver the Fourth, that all able bodied Coldain fight to the death in defense of our land. Children, disabled citzens, and unseasoned travellers are advised to evacuate immediately! 

<p>Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'My fellow soldiers, take heart! For we are not alone in this endeavor. One among us, an outlander, has earned the title Hero of the Dain for valiant service to our people. This newcomer has brought with him allies that will fight alongside you to help bring about our victory. 

<p>Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'My friends... Brell did not place us here so many centuries ago to be slaughtered by these heathens. Nor did our forefather, Colin Dain, sacrifice himself simply to have us fail here now. Through these events we were brought to this day to test our strength and our faith. 

<p>Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Will we be shackled together to slave away in Kromrif mines or will we stand united and feed these beasts Coldain blades? By Brell I promise you, 'It is better to die on our feet than to live on our knees!' 

<p>Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'TROOPS, TAKE YOUR POSITIONS!! 

<p>Narandi the Wretched shouts 'No need to pray to your little God stumpymen, you'll be meeting him in person soon enough! 

<p>Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'You'll be begging Brell for forgiveness by the day's end, vile beast! 

<p>Narandi the Wretched shouts 'Kromrif! Form up! Dispatch these tiny fools and destroy Thurgadin. Theres a keg of ice mead waiting for every man back at home.

<p><20:32:25> Kementar tells the guild, 'POP SOUTH'
</i></ul>

<p><b> ZRELIK the SCOUT</b>

<p>Zrelik the Scout is a dark blue con to a 60th level, and will follow you around. He will assist exactly the same as an enchanter pet in that you have to be hit for him to assist you. However you cannot call him off. Don't worry about having SOW or whatever, he will run pretty fast to keep up.

<p>He CAN be killed, but don't worry overly. If he is killed you just lose the ability to command the dwarf armies. He is NOT a hero, and you lose no "end loot" by him dying. But more on that later. As a monk/SK, if you FD you also FD off your pet. Meaning he no longer moves around. So I'd suggest leaving him in the middle with the other dwarfs rather than in the middle of the battlefield.

<p>Some people actually purposefully get Zrelik killed as he can be a pain. Myself, I just FD'd at the huts and left him there nice and safe.

<p><b> THE GOAL</b>

<p>The goal of the war is to stop Seneschal Aldikar being killed, and to kill Narandi the Wretched. If any giant reaches Thurgadin, the Seneshal will (usually) be killed, and you lose the war.

<p>If this happens, then a line of giants pop outside Thurgadin "guarding it", and every NPC inside Thurgadin de-spawns (dies). This is usually for about 2 hours duration.

<p>You will be pretty unpopular for de-popping Thurg for 2+ hours, so don't start the war unless you know what you are doing.

<p><b> DWARF ARMIES</b>

<p>The Dwarf armies consist of 6 "camps" of dwarfs.

<p>The 1st is right at the Thurgadin entrance itself. It's commanded by Seneschal Aldikar himself standing near the zone line, with some crossbow men outside in the vally. If he dies (ie, a Giant reaches the falls) you lose.

<p>The 2nd is a little down the river at the "huts" (or towers as Aldikar calls them). This is commanded by Dobbin.

<p>The 3rd is to the East of that point, near the needle in the valley towards the EW zone. It's commanded by Garadain.

<p>The 4th is up the hill on the West towards the Tizmak caves. It's commanded by Churn.

<p>The 5th is to the West of the huts at the bottom of the hill down from the Tizmak caves. It's a line of crossbow men commanded by Kargin.

<p>The 6th is just outside the Wurm caves tucked into a little alcove to the west of it, and is commanded by Corbin.

<p>These are the hero's you must protect during the War if you want any of the "extra" end items. If a dwarf camp gets over run and the hero killed, you will lose his item.

<p>You cannot heal any of the NPC's, but they have their own clerics, so usually there is no need.

<p>If your a caster, be careful to not use any AoE spells around the dwarfs, because you will agro them.

<p><b> THE WAR & MOBS</b>

<p>The war itself consist of three "major" waves. Once a major wave is finished there is usually a 10 minute break where everyone can rest for a while and get ready for the next wave.

<p>Each major wave itself consists of several "mini" waves of mobs. The number of mini waves is semi-random, and the number of mobs in each mini wave is semi-random. As long as you kill each mini wave fairly quickly you will end up with around two minutes between them, but if your slow they can over lap.

<p><u>Wave 1</u>

<p>The first major wave consists of Kromrif Recruit's and Kromrif Captain's.

<p>The Recruits are pretty easy and can be handled by just about any 60th solo, even unslowed. They are not very MR and can easily be slowed, nuked, rooted and snared. They are akin to the simple blue con trash mobs at the WL zone of Kael, but have more HP's.

<p>The Captain summons and needs a couple of people on him, even so, not too hard. Leave the Captain until last.

<p>At the end of the First Major wave, the following text should occur.
<p><ul> <i> 
Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Outlander, our scouts report no more Kromrif for the time being. Resurrect your fallen and heal your wounded. I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of them. 

<p>Narandi the Wretched shouts 'Interlopers! You've chosen the wrong side in this war. My warriors will succeed where the young recruits have failed. You shall suffer the same fate as the pathetic vermin you serve. Your heads shall be perched upon our spears along with those of your Coldain friends! 

<p>Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Pay no attention to his babbling, outlander. It is our destiny to emerge victorious. Prepare your army for glorious battle! 

<p>Narandi the Wretched shouts 'My warriors approach, I offer you one final opportunity to bow before the might of Rallos Zek. Throw down your weapons and surrender. You will live out your lives in relative peace, rightfully serving your Kromrif masters. 

<p>Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Enough! Show yourself coward! Your blasphemous words shall be etched upon your spacious brow. All will mock you for generations to come. Your own god will forsake you when he witnesses your defeat here today! 

<p>Narandi the Wretched shouts 'Warriors! Charge through these pompous fools. Any you manage to capture shall become your personal slaves. The outlanders and the Seneschal must die! Bring me their heads! 
</i></ul>

<p><u>Wave 2</u>

<p>The 2nd major wave consists of Kromrif Warrior's, Priest's of Zek, and sometimes a Kromrif General.

<p>Tougher, and you will probably need the mob slowing or a CH. Once slowed they can be solo tanked pretty easily, but have a large number of HP's so will take a while. Two people can handle one fine once slowed.

<p>The Priests and Warriors are around level 50.

<p>Take out the Priests before the Warriors.

<p>Generals are around level 55, and are as hard as Vets in Kael and should be killed last in each wave.

<p>2nd wave still slowable with a few resists, magic lands fine and can be snared.

<p>All giants in the 2nd wave summon, and Generals enrage.

<p>Again, at the end of the second wave, the following text should occur.
<p><ul> <i> 
Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Well fought, friends! May the piles of Kromrif corpses strike fear in the hearts of our overgrown enemies. 

<p>Narandi the Wretched shouts 'Silence fool! Speak not of our fallen. They who die honorably in combat earn an eternal rest in the company of our greatest heroes... even Rallos Zek himself! 

<p>Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'It is your misguided beliefs that made this war necessary. Now you feel the sting of your errors. Return to Kael and preach the doctrine of Brell Serilis in hopes that your people may someday be spared. 

<p>Narandi the Wretched shouts 'Enough chatter. Our veterans approach now to finish you. You have been tested and your weaknesses have been assessed. Bid farewell to your dear Thurgadin, those of you who are fortunate enough to survive the slaughter shall make a new home in the Kromrif slave pens! 

<p>Narandi the Wretched shouts 'Veterans! Be sure that this time we allow none of the stumpymen to escape to create yet another city. This shall be our final war with these unworthy beings. 
</i></ul>

<p><u>Wave 3</u>

<p>The 3rd major wave consists of Kromrif Veteran's, High Priest's of Zek and 4 Kromrif Warlord's. So sometimes you will get a WL in a wave, and sometimes not.

<p>A typical pop is 8 Veterans, 2 Priests and a Warlord.

<p>Veterans are around level 58, hit for 200 and will very quickly beat a none tank down. They are pretty MR, and you'll be lucky to land a magic based slow unless fully debuffed or snare on them. Tanks will die unless they have healing close by. Disease slow lands ok.

<p>The Priests can be slowed by magic.

<p>Warlords are level 60, hit for 350 odd and are similar to a PoZ (Kael), and it's usually best to have a defensive warrior solo tank them with a dedicated cleric until the other mobs in the wave are dead. Some WL's are also casters.

<p>You should kill the High Priests first, then the Veterans and then the Warlord.

<p>Once you get your 4th Warlord pop in a wave, get ready for Narandi, because he usually appears very soon.

<p><u>Spearmen</u>

<p>There are also 2 permanent placements of Giant Spearmen. These don't pop immediately on commencement of the war, but usually after the first mini-wave.

<p>One is up near the Wurm cave "Needle" in the valley towards the Spires, and the other is directly opposite across the ice plain towards the druid ring. These stay in place and de-spawn soon after the end of the war.

<p>Giant Spearmen are of themselves not too hard, however they summon which can be a real problem if you get within agro range of them. You will not easily be able to escape them once summoned, 

<p>As stated elsewhere, if you have the forces, try and kill the two lines of spearmen during quiet moments of the first wave.

<p>At the end of the 3rd major wave Narandi the Wretched spawns down the river from Thurgadin near the wurm caves. When this occurs, all of the normal Coldain Dwarfs will de-spawn except for the hero's.

Each mini wave can spawn in one of three places.

1. Directly south of Thurgadin near the Wurm caves.
        These will run straight down the river towards Thurgadin.
2. Near Nexus spires.
        These can head in two directions.
        West towards the river, and then down the river.
        OR North towards the needle and the dwarfs there, and then West towards Thurgadin.
3. West plains.
        These can head in two directions.
        East towards the river, and then when half way there run North/East towards the dwarfs and Thurgadin.
        North straight up the hill towards the Tizmak caves and the dwarfs on top.

For 2 & 3, until you have killed (see below) the spearmen, it's not a good idea to approach the giants spawn points as you can agro the spearmen and get summoned. Once the spearmen are dead, you can engage the pop whenever you want.

Each wave can be of a varying size, so it's a good idea for the tracker to call out on a pop if it's small or large, and for the 3rd wave if it has a Warlord or not.
