    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Brother Qwinn is not a
      permanent spawn, and is a rare wandering NPC.<BR>
       <BR>A tracker in the form of a Druid or Ranger is extremely useful in tracking
      him down, and most Monks at this stage offer rewards for him to be held
      for them.<BR>
       <BR> Brother Qwinn does have a Placeholder, but who/what not been confirmed.
      However Sentry Alchin is confirmed NOT to be a PH, as both have been seen
      on tracking at the same time. <BR><BR>
       The only thing that can be confirmed about his path is the fact that he
      wanders past Paw and towards the aviak village, with the rest of his route
      being random. I would walk in a northerly direction from the Lake Rathe
      zone, passing with both the aviaks and paw on my right hand side towards
      the ruins near the bridge, killing everything on that path in an effort to
      get him to spawn.<BR>
       <BR> Again, he is a very rare NPC, and I personally waited 6 days, spending 4
      hrs a day looking for him, so take this into account if multiquesting the
      Robe.</FONT></P>

         He is an uncommon spawn rather than rare, and isprobably only slightly
        rarer than the Kobold King.<BR>

         The room has 4 spawns, which can be any of the following: Greater

        Shaman (and pet), Solusk Kobold King, or Targin. <BR>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">Although he is supposed to
      be tougher than Raster, this room within Sol B is MUCH more likely to be
      camped than the Mino Room in Lower Guk, and so there will be lots of ppl
      on hand to help, either from the King Room, or from a group taking the
      Preist or Champion rooms. <BR><BR>
       For reference, at 42nd, with full hits and a mend, and armed with one
      Baton and no haste, I could solo some Greater Kobolds, and even a SK with
      a sizable hp buff, but breaking the room with Shaman and others in there
      on my own would be VERY hard. Splitting the room may be a possibility, but
      you will more than likely pull the other nearby rooms as well, so it is
      best to join a group nearby, or make it known to the zone that you are
      after him. As a personal Note, I spent around 35 hours over a month long
      period camping Targin. I arrived at Sol B half way through 42nd, and got
      him at 45th. </FONT></P>

      are confirmed as Hasten Bootstruter (for the Journeymans Boots quest), a
      drake, and a mid 30's Ranger called Maldyn the Unkempt. If you are unlucky
      to find Hasten up, and do not have the manpower to kill him, he apparently
      despawns in 2 to 4 hrs. Maldyn was easily bested by a 45th Monk with
      Haste, but he has a damage sheild up, so fight with fists rather than low
      delay weapons, else you will do his job for him. The PH is a 20ish minute
