<p><b>Beyond the dwarf town: Spiders, Stalagmites, Lizards, and Rocks </b>

<p>The area in and around the dwarf is easy and safe to wander around, take a minute and explore. There a large number of named dwarfs, as well as gaurds and dwarf miners.

<p>To get to the next areas to hunt you must go through the dwarf town. Coming from the orcside run into town and past the vendors. The hallway leads to the right, at which point you will see several dwarf guards. Running into the tunnel they are guarding will take you to the following areas : Bridge room with stalag terrors, Platform with 2 stalag terros, Queen Room with drachinid queen, Large Terror Room with life leech/hollow crystal/Stalag Carver, and Geonid Tunnel with geonids.

<p><b>Broken Bridge Room </b>

<p>Ok, past guards the tunnel leads down, down, down. At the bottom is a large room with a broken bridge, river, and what appear to be several lean to type shelters. 

<p><b>Broken Bridge Room mobs: </b>

<p>This room can be soloed from about 40 on with a little patience. 2 types of mobs can be found in this room: 4 Stalag Terrors (look just like tentacle terrors) and 1 velium crawler (nasty looking lizard thingys), both have a fair amount of hp and hit quite hard. 

<p><I>Stalag Terrors (lvl 32-37): </I>4 stalag terros spawn in this room, one just to the left of the corridor coming from dwarves, one to the right, one in the far right corner, and one adjacent to the corridor on the the other side of the room across the broken bridge. Stalag Terrors are static spawns and appear as icy looking cousins of tentacle terrors. They can be soloed with patience, from about 40th or so on. Although, this will involve some downtime unless you have some very nice buffs. Terrors drop coin, gems. Their uncommon is a crystal fiber (1hs, 8/26, whip), rare drop is Stalag Terror Spine Spear (1hp, 15/34, procs disempower, shd only) 

<p><I>Velium Crawler (lvl 30-34): </I>Velium crawlers are nasty looking little lizard type beasties. They hit quite hard and have a fair number of hps, but are more of a nuisance than anything. The velium crawler in this room swims through river and will agro you just at the wrong time. They drop velium crawler eyes as common loot, no nice rare stuff from this fella.

<p>What/Where to Whack mobs

<p>Each terror in this room can be fought at their spawn point. Best pattern is to start with the terror immeadiatly to the left as you enter room from dwarf area. Procede to the terror just across the river in the corner. Then the one just to the right of the tunnel leading away from this room, then the one in the corner that is to the right of the tunnel leading from dwarves. If you fight in this order you will avoid them agroing eash other as they run from you.

<p>If you are at the lower end of levels that that can handle this room, the only problem lies with the velium crawler, as he wanders through the river and has a huge agro range. So occasionally you have to fd him off. Also, terrors run into water, making it a pain to finish them off, especially if a velium crawler or another terror agros you.

<p><b>NOTE, EXCEPTION TO THE ABOVE RULE ABOUT TRAINING MOBS TO DWARVES: YOU CAN TRAIN STALAGS AND ANY OTHER MOB YOU FIND BEYOND DWARF TOWN TO THE DWARF GAURDS, THEY DON'T LIKE THEM, THE WILL KILL THEM. </b>

<p><b>Beyond the Broken Bridge Room</b>

<p>Past bridge room is a hallway, with stairs leading up to a large corridor/platform. The platform is very short, and ends with stairs going down on left and right, wrapping around a little pool. At top of stairs near the pool, on either side of the corridor, there are 2 terrors. I usually just run down the middle and jump into the pool to avoid agro'ing these fellas. You can pull them singly by attacking while standing on the ledge they are on and backing up while staying on the ledge. You cannot pull singles from middle of room, as when you agro one it paths towards the other. If you pull them back down corridor/platform, they are easily split.

<p>At the bottom of the stairs, just beyond pool, the main tunnel splits into 3. This area is not safe, there are always 2 crystal crawlers waiting just inside the middle tunnel, if you get close to it they will agro on you.. The best place to split these 2 is by pulling to just inside the tunnel on the right. Don't pull too far in as there is a higher level terror waiting there for you. Don't worry though, this area is safe and used as a spot to pull to by many, just don't go too far in.

<p>Also, the pool will occasionally have a velium crawler that will come after you, these are very easy to feign off, as they like to keep moving.

<p>If this area is clear or you are invis, you now have 3 choices: right, left or middle. Left leads to &#8216;Large Terror Room&#8217;, middle leads to &#8216;Queen Room&#8217;, right leads to Geonids, and the other &#8220;safe&#8221; way out of this dungeon.

<p><b>The Large talag Terror Room</b>

<p>The tunnel on the left leads to the 'terror room'. The tunnel leading to it is full of terrors, and the room at the end is where the Life Leech, Hollow Crystal, and Stalag Carver all spawn. In addition to these named terrors, 4 or 5 stalag terrors will also spawn in this room.

<p><b>Terror Room Mobs:</b>

<p>Several differently named mobs can be found in this room, all are different versions of the stalag terror. So nothing to exciting visually, but there is some nice loot and xp to be had

<p><I>Stalag Terrors : </I>(see above)

<p><I>Life Leech (38-40) : </I>The life leech is just a large version of a stalag terror. He is a non-casting mob, hits hard, has a bunch of hps. His common loot is the Chipped Velium Amulet (neckslot, ac4, str5, hp30, weight 0.1, all/all). This is a very nice monk necklace, and if you&#8217;re lucky someone will shout that one of these is available, as it is lore, and a common drop. He drops Blackened Crytalline robe as rare loot. Also, decent pp and gems can also be dropped.

<p><I>Hollow Crystal (37-40) :</I> The hollow crystal looks just like the life leech. It is essentially the same mob but it doesn&#8217;t have force spell. The common drop off this fella is the crystal fiber (see above). Uncommon is Frostone Stein, a lore/no drop stein, that (i believe) gives 10cha and some sta...all/all.

<p><I>Terror Carver (lvl 35) : </I>Terror Carver is the more rare of the named stalag terrors, it is large like the previous two and it&#8217;s common drop is the Stalag Terror Spine Spear (see above).

<p><b>What/Where to Whack mobs</b>

<p>When you enter tunnel, you will encounter 2 terror side by side. Usually one is slightly higher lvl than the other. You can pull these back to corner of tunnel without agroing spiders. They are not too difficult to split. Next, there is a single spawn. This one is usually a bit tougher than first 2, and often one of the larger Terrors will spawn here. Now it gets difficult. When you agro the next terror, 2 or 3 more will follow. With enought trial and error, these can be split solo, if you have someone doing crowd control, no problem. Now you will be in a room that leads to the larger stalag room. If you succesfully split the single, you will now see 2 more spawns on either side of entrance to main room. If you agro one, 3 will come, as there is another one just inside large room Once you take out these 3, there are 3 more inside, and that's it. This tunnel and room can be alot of fun both with a group, and solo if you are 45+. Splitting all of the mobs solo is a challenge, but can be fun. A nice group in mid 30's/40 should do just fine here.

<p><b>The Queen Room</b>

<p>The tunnel in the middle leads to the Queen Room. The queen room is a large room with a huge web on the far wall, and a broken bridge separating the queen/web area from the entrance into the room. The water between these areas is where the velium crawlers spawn. The tunnel leading to it is full of the various forms of crystal-type spiders, as well as Drachinid-type spiders. 

<p><b>Queen Room Mobs: </b>

<p>In the queen room you will generally find numerous crystal type spiders, a few velium crawlers, and when your lucky, Queen Drachnia and/or her various henchmen, which are Drachinid-type spiders and all either uncommon, rare, or ultra rare spawns. Most drachinid-types can spawn at several areas in the queen room, including the queen spawn point, and points to both the left and right of her ph.

<p><I>Queen Drachnia (lvl 40+): </I>The drachinid queen is a non-casting mob, but not terribly tough. She hits very hard, breaks root quite easily, and runs at sow speed. And although she is a non-caster, she procs a fire based damage spell. She is the single most sought after mob in this dungeon, as her common loot is quite nice. She is normally camped by groups 40 and up. She drops several nice items, sometimes just one, sometimes several. Drops include Crystallized Sword (1hs, 11/29), Crystallized 2 hander (2hs, 24/49), Crystalline Robe (ac10, int6, agi2, mana10, cr10, mr5, weight 2.0, int based caster), Messenger of the Queen (2hp, 20/40, str5, wis5, cr5, paly only).

<p><I>Crystal Lurker (lvl 36) : </I>The crystal lurker is a non-casting, drachinid-type mob. Nothing special here, common loot is one of the crystallized swords (see above), uncommon is spider fang choker (ac3, sta2, agi2, mana20, cr5, mr5, all/all)

<p><I>Crystal Purifier (lvl 36) : </I>This is the most rare of the queen room spawns, although this one can also be found just outside of queen room in tunnel. Standard fare here, non-casting, drachinid-type mob. Common loot is one of the crystallized swords (see above), rare loot is Crystal Lined Slippers (ac5, wis3, int3, weight 1.8, all/all) 

<p><I>Drachinid Lurker (lvl 36) : </I>The drachinid lurker is a non-casting, drachinid type mob. Common loot is one of the crystallized swords (see above), uncommon is spider fang choker (see above), or Crystal Webshield (held slot, ac15, mana20, hp20, cr10, weight 0.1)

<p><I>Drachinid Retainer (lvl 36) : </I>Very similar to crystal lurker, non-casting. Drachinid-type mob. Common loot is one of the crystallized swords (see above), uncommon is Glowing Velium Axe (2hs, 18/37, sta5, warrior classes), or Crystal Webshield (see above) 

<p>The ultra rare drop off any on the drachinid-type mobs is the ball of velium (range slot, cr1, dr1, fr1, mr1,pr1, effect velium shards, clickable, unlimited charges)

<p><I>Crystal Crawler (lvl 32-33) : </I>Classic spider mob with crystalline appearance. Hits hard and can cast blindness, which gets very annoying. Common drops are crystalline silk and uncommon is crystalline net, this net casts a 45th lvl spell, ensnaring roots, which roots mob and is a 50hp dd. Ultra-rare is ball of velium. Also drops gems and jewelry.

<p><I>Crystal Webmaster (lvl 30-34) :</I> Classic spider mob with crystalline appearance. Hits hard and can cast blindness, which gets very annoying. Drops are similar to crystal crawler.

<p><I>Crystal Spiderling (lvl 20-28): </I>Classic spider mob with crystalline appearance. No casting ability on this one. Drops similar to above

<p><I>Velium Crawler (30-34) : </I>(see above)


<p><b>What/Where to Whack mobs</b>

<p>The tunnel leading to queen is full of various crystal-type spiders. This is a great place to solo at around 38th-42nd or so. You can fd flop past these fellas quite easily if the queen room is your goal. I can't say for sure how many spiders spawn in hall but it is somewhere around 8. 2 statics at entrance to tunnel, 1 static at first corner, 2 statics at....3 or 4th corner, one a little bit further, and 2 just before queen room. And usually a handful of wanderers make 8-10 all told. Once high enough you can just move from one end to the other. The only problem is all of the wanderers. 

<p>The queen room can in no way be soloed by anyone in their 40's; it can be handled by a group in their low to mid 40's, upper 30's. Some groups set up at the entrance into the queen room and have casters pull mobs across water that separates them from queen area. Others just cross 'moat' and fight in front of web, either way works fine, but i prefer fighting in front of web as it doesn't involve crossing water as frequently. 

<p>Recently (as of 3/26), higher level tailors have taken to clearing out tunnel attempting to get silk for the recently discovered tailoring recipes that use crystalline silk. So, it has become more difficult for those wanting some great xp to get it. Although generally, they will let you take out spiders if they can loot silk. They also might keep you well buffed.

<p><b>Geonid Tunnel/Dungeon Exit</b>

<p>The tunnel to the right is where geonids can be found, and is the other "safe" way out that I mentioned earlier. This tunnel is like the tunnels the orcs are found in, as it has a mining tunnel look to it. Most of this tunnel leads straight up, with intermittent level areas where geonids spawn. At the bottom of the tunnel is a single stalag terror spawn. This is the only mob in this area that will agro you. This terror can also spawn as one of the large terrors. 

<p><b>Geonid-type Mobs</b>

<p>Geonids are big rock type creatures. The common ones are simply called geonids, the uncommon, named ones are the Focus Gem, and the Gem Collector. None of these fellas will agro you, but they will bring friends if you attack first. 

<p><I>Geonid (lvl 32-38) :</I> This is a big, non-casting, tanking brute type of a mob They hit hard, and have bunches of hps. The nice thing about them is the loot they drop. Often nice gems that can be sold to vendors, some of the more rare ones have magical properties (nothing worth writing about though). The better gems sell for 40+pp, some of the gems dropped are for armor quests, so be careful what you sell (i'm not sure which gems are quest gems, i'll add it when i find out) 

<p><I>Gem Collector & Focus Gem (lvl 35-40) :</I> These look identical to normal geonids, they just hit harder and have more hps on average. They drop nicer gems than geonids on average, most of which sell for around 40pp to vendors. Some for as much as 120pp. Many of these nicer gems have magical properties as mentioned above. 

<p><b>What/Where to Whack mobs</b> 

<p>At the bottom of the first ramp there is a static terror spawn. Take this fella out, and fight your way up. The geos are spaced far enough apart that if you fight up, they will not chain agro each other. There are approximatley 6-8 geos on the way up to the zone line (mind blank, don't remember exact number). You can expect to encounter one or two named geonids on every third or so clearing of the spawns. Never fight from top down as they will then chain agro as they flee. The geonids can be soloed in low 40's or so, but i recommend waiting until 44, and then only if well equipped. 

<p><b>WARNING!! DO NOT KILL GEONIDS IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON DOING THE PHENOCRYST CRYSTAL QUEST: KILLING THEM WILL GIVE FACTION HITS MAKING THIS QUEST UNDOABLE. </b>

<p>As mentioned above, geos will not agro you, but will help each other if within agro range. As with other mobs down here, they are not too tough to split, but you generally won't have to as they are static and you should never pull one past another. A small group in upper 30's/low 40's can do quite well here. The xp from these fellas is excellent, whether alone or with a group. Incidentally, I have now killed 100+ geonids and just recently became dubious. Once you've killed enough of these fellas that you're KOS, you probably can fight your waY out anyway, so it won't really matter.

<p><b>Leaving, the safe way</b>

<p>If you want to leave the dungeon run up, up, up, past all the geonids, and you will eventually zone. You end up zoning back into Eastern Wastes just outside of orc fort, in a relatively safe area.
