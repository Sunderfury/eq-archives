You can make money selling some of the brutal drinks to dwarves to support their alcoholic tendencies, but booze is also used in many other parts of the game. Bog Juice is used to help Paladins get Soulfire, Heady Kiola's are used by us for making Cured Silk, Tailored Whips and Wu's Gauntlets, Gnomish Spirts can be sold to gnomes for tinkering things, and Tumpy Tonics are used in a few quests, among them the Trueshot quest.</p><p>To brew you gather the ingredients, combine them in a brewing barrel, and viola, you have the new product if you succeed, or get the bottle/cask back if you fail. Brewing barrels can be found in almost every city across Norrath and there are usually more than one per city. Stacked items must be placed in one at a time and this can be done by Ctrl+Click on the stack of ingredients.</p><p>As per usual with trade skills, I recommend dumping 20 points into brewing just to save time, but this is in no way necessary, as brewing goes up fairly quickly on it's own. And as soon as you hit the trivial level for something, move on to the next.</p><p><STRONG>Trivial Table</STRONG></p><p><TABLE border=3>

Heady Kiolas themselves are money pits while learning and I never recommend using them to practice your skills up.<LI>You can buy stacks of Snake Scales Spider Legs, Rat Ears, Veggies and Fruits or Fire Beetle Eyes in Newbie Zones such as EC, NRO, North Qeynos or Misty Thicket fairly cheaply.<LI>Kiola Nuts must be bought on Sister Island in the Ocean of Tears.<LI>Fresh Fish can be caught with Fishing skill or bought in many dock area shops.<LI>Barley, Hops, Malt and Yeast must be bought in special brewing areas scattered around Antonica such as in Highhold, Qeynos, Neriak and Freeport. They may be elsewhere but those are all I have found as of yet.<LI>Most other Items can be gotten fairly cheaply in many shops around Norrath.</p></ul>
