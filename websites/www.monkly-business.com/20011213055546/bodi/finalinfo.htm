      to the large amount of people involved, and the level of the people
      present, the fight had no casualties. I would imagine 3 high level (55+)

      she must have been slightly out of aggro range when Vorash was tagged.
      Vone dragged my body back to shore (thanks!), and while waiting for a res,

      mistakes, so decided to finish it off the next day with a clear head.
      Unfortunatly, I hardly slept, as I had recieved some weight reducing
      shuriken bags, and even though I knew I put the fang in my Tinkers bag, I
      kept thinking it was in the no rent shuriken bag.....</FONT></P>

      more than once. I wrote it, and have read it 100's of times, and still
      wanted to make sure I had it all correct. Got to Trakanons Teeth (after
      being feared and chased by an Undead Hunter) I found Kariaren. He was not
      at the loc in the guide, and had been moved from his spot, probably by
