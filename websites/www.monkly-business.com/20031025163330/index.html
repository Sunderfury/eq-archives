Both Nvidia and ATI have introduced new cards that are or will be available in the coming week or so.
</p>
<p>
Ati has Introduced the XT version of the 9600 and 9800 both are very Minor upgrades to the Pro series. so if you are looking for a new card by ati now is the time to look at the dropping prices of the 9600 and 9800 pro.
</p>
<p>
Nvidia has introduced 2 new cards the fx 5950 ultra and the fx 5700 ultra. While the 5950 is a minor upgrade to the high end (Gainward has a version that is a good 10% faster(it is liquid cooled)), the 5700 ultra in most benchmarks is a significant upgrade to the 5600 ultra. and takes over the "mainstream" segment very well for that company. both the nvidia 5700 ultra and the 9600 xt score Very similarly in most benchmarks- ati does fsaa better, nvidia does anthro better.
</p>
<p>
Nvidia has Also introduced the successor to the Detonator Driver Series - <a href='http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_52.16'>The Forceware Driver Series</a> Version 52.16 is now Released and Available for Download from Nvidia.
</p>
<p>
As a side note remember a few months ago over the flak Nvidia got over optimizing its drivers for benchmark programs?
</p>
<p>
 WELL, apparently ATI's latest drivers(3.8) are being investigated for the same thing(for aquamark i believe and possible unreal)using default 16 bit textures when the higher res ones are requested by the benchmark...Nvidia's current drivers reflect their new "no benchmark specific optimization" while showing probably the best image quality that they have in recent memory.
</p>
<p>
Also S3 and XGI are going to be releasing Their new Graphics cards shortly so the winter is going to be VERY fun for the Video card upgrade department.

You heard right the Framerate of Doom 3 is going to be CAPPED at 60fps so that even if your computer can handle more fps, the game won't allow you too, you can read the announcement here on IGN <a href='http://pc.ign.com/articles/456/456054p1.html'>Doom3 Framerate Article</a>. the Issue is according to JC is the game runs at "60hz" thus even if you had a comp capable of 80 fps you'd be getting some frames shown twice which are exactly the same.

To "help" Players find the path to the force sensitive slot, there are Jedi Holocrons out there, once you receive one, a text message will appear which will "point" you to the path to unlocking the force sensitive slot. while I remain skeptical as to whether jedi powers were in the game prior to the last patch, since the patch alot of people are "getting the path hints". Basically the text will be "master xxx profession" I  Dread being a combat person who has to master "hairdressing" for the path to "enlightenment". 
</p>
<p>
In Other News, on the Test Server they have implemented decay on death for items - Currently it is in my opinion, a bit HIGH for each death - 20% - but whether or not it goes live in this form is anyone's.

Planetside has the Pre-order section up for it's Core Combat Expansion that is due in a week or so, AND they have implemented a new "platoon" group - it is sorta like a Raid group in EQ.
