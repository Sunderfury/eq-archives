              <STRONG>Freeport Sash Quests</STRONG></p><p><u>From Velan Torresk</u></p><p>White Training Sash</p><ul><p><u>2 Deathfist Pawn Scalps</u> - from Deathfist Pawns wandering outside the west gate of Freeport. Do not zone out to east commons, as the "orc pawns" out there drop a different type of scalp.<br><u>Snake Fang</u> - From the level 1 snakes also just outside the west gate of Freeport.<br><u>Bone Chips</u> - Any skeleton in the game can drop these. The Decaying Skeletons in west freeport do just fine.</p></ul><p>Yellow Sash of Order</p><ul><p><u>Deathfist Slashed Belt</u> - The Deathfist Orcs can drop these. Only Centurions and stronger orcs have a chance to give you a belt, not pawns. There are two Deathfist orc camps in east commons (along the north wall, on either side of the "Hidden Inn") where you can hunt or ask to buy one of these belts.<br><u>Giant Snake Rattle</u> - These drop off the tougher snakes, darkweeds and above. Darkweed snakes in east commons are the quickest way to go - if you're still under level 10, bring a healer. This will be some of the strongest poison you have encountered.<br><u>Desert Tarantula Chitin</u> - Dune Tarantulas in North Ro are where you'll find these. Make sure you loot the right item - "cracked" chitins are not useful for the quest.<br><u>White Training Sash</u></p></ul><p><u>From Reyia</u></p><p>Orange Sash of Order</p><ul><p><u>Legionnaire's Bracer</u> - These drop off the Legionnaires of the Deathfist and Crushbone orcs. They're rather rare if you try to hunt legos in the Commonlands, the quickest way to get your bracer is to go to Crushbone (from Greater Faydark). There, they seem to drop like candy.<br><u>Greater Lightstone</u> - Willowisp type mobs drop these. The GLS is semi-rare, but not too hard to get if you hunt the wisps for a half hour or so. Alternatively, just send out an auction in West Commons. There are always people buying and selling lightstones there for a few plat.<br><u>Dervish Cutthroat Ring</u> - Any Dervish Cutthroat has a chance to drop one of these. There are three derv camps in North Ro, and one in West Commons.<br><u>Yellow Sash of Order</u></p></ul><p>Red Sash of Order</p><ul><p><u>Sapphire of Souls</u> - This can be found from an NPC named "Ekeros" in the Najena dungeon. Ekeros is a somewhat rare spawn, you can find him in the room just outside Rathyl's room. EQ Atlas provides a nice map of najena to get you where you're going. Note - in Najena you need a key to get to Ekeros' spawn point. You can either get the key from another player, or you'll have to go after them yourself. Najena has a sequence of keys that open up deeper and deeper parts of the dungeon to you. The Ogre Guards drop guard's keyring, the first one you'll need. Bonecracker drops another key, the ogre captain drops a third. These are the only keys you need to get into Rathyl's area (Rathyl himself drops another key that leads you further in towards Najena's room). When you kill Ekeros, the item you get is named "A Blackened Sapphire" - this is the Sapphire of Souls.<br><u>Wand of Marnek</u> - This drops from Priest Amiez on the bottom level of Befallen. It is named "a Blackened Wand". See EQAtlas for a more detailed zone guide.<br><u>Orange Sash of Order</u></p></ul><p><STRONG>Qeynow Headband Quests</STRONG></p><p><u>From Phin Esrinap</u></p><ul><p>White Headband</p><p><u>4 Gnoll Pup Scalps</u> - gnoll pups spawn outside the queynos gates, but only during the daytime. This can be frustrating since you're stuck waiting for half an hour if you don't get your four scalps right away. So far, I have found no better place near queynos to find the gnoll pups and scalps, however.</p></ul><p>Yellow Headband</p><ul><p><u>3 Putrid Rib Bones</u> - These drop from the putrid skeletons at the haunted ruins of Queynos Hills (the ruins are between Blackburrow and Surefall Glade)<br><u>White Headband</u></p></ul><p>Orange Headband</p><ul><p><u>2 Blackburrow Gnoll Pelts</u> - In the second level of Blackburrow (which is actually the hardest level - weird lil zone) you'll find elite guards, commanders, guardsmen, etc. Most of these gnolls have a chance to drop a pelt. Make sure you don't keep any ruined pelts, as they are useless to this quest.<br><u>Blackburrow Gnoll Skin</u> - These will sometimes drop off elite guards and commanders in Blackburrow. Fairly rare drop, I had to slaughter several spawn points of these types for about an hour before I saw one.<br><u>Yellow Headband</u></p></ul><p><u>From Togahn Sorast</u></p><p>Red Headband</p><ul><p><u>Head of Granhex Drah</u> - Granhex Drah, the leader of the Split Paw Gnolls, can now be found at the skeleton camp in South Karana. Kill him to get his head (I've heard it can be pickpocketed as well - now THERE is a skilled thief)<br><u>Head of Shen</u> - Dropped from High Shaman Grisok in South Karana. He's a fairly rare spawn, usually seen wandering around just east of the Aviak Tree. His placeholder can be an escaped splitpaw gnoll or another named mob, Shaman Lenrel I believe was the name.<br><u>Brother Dareb's Skull</u> - Dropped from High Shaman Phido in South Karana. I never did find this elusive little gnoll. There is another named Shaman (Ren'rex) that wanders along the west wall of the zone, but I have not been able to confirm that Ren'Rex is a placeholder for Phido. I have also read about some people finding Phido south of the hermit. In any case, be prepared to auction for a while or bring a tracker, this is a true pain in the ass to find.<br><u>Orange Headband</u></p></ul><p>Purple Headband</p><ul><p><u>Skull of Jhen'Tra</u> - Drops from gnoll embalmers at the camp in Lake Rathe (just after you zone in from SK). Note - at night this camp spawns undead mobs and not gnolls, you can only try for your skull in the daytime.<br><u>Dagger of Marnek</u> - Dropped by the thaumaturgist in Befallen.<br><u>Coronet of Buried Blood</u> - This is actually Zaharn's Coronet, an item from High Priest Zaharn in Permafrost.<br><u>Red Headband</u>
