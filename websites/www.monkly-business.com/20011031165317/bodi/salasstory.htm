        a land known as Norrath, there was a young boy called Salas, who was
        born in a small secret village called surefall glades. Without anyone
        knowing the boys true father, he was born as an elf just like his
        mother, with all the good looks of an elf. </FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Soon, with training from his step father,
        he grew into a boy with great skills of the wild and survival skills in
        his home of the woodlands, where he grew up playing with the bears and
        tormenting the nearby gnoll pups as any young boy does. </FONT><BR>

        <FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"></FONT></TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Then next came the news of him needing to
      be able to fight for himself, which came as a shock to the young lad, as
      he was too kind and caring to be a fighter, yet he always had a strong
      side which he had never known until he started training with his father.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">He was not just a normal elf, he had
      another side to him which was not of the elf nature, and as he grew to be
      strong, he also became a good fighter, one with added woodland skills,
      which would aid him in his soon to come travels. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">As time went by, the glade got more
      populated and more business came so more traveller's stopped by to pick up
      supplies. One day as Salas was learning his archery skills with his
      father, there was a big event in the city as a young warrior arrived in
      the glades. This was not just any warrior, but a warrior wearing full
      finely made crafted plate armour, which was not the armour for the poor,
      but a fine suit of armour made by the best smithy's from Norrath. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">The warrior stayed for a while, as on his
      way here he had fought in a battle, and needed to rest, so as he did he
      watched as I showed my skills in archery. As he sat, he drank wine and
      stout till the pain had gone, but in doing so, had made himself very drunk
      in the process. I helped the warrior to my house so he could rest
      properly, rather than sleep near the rock he had fallen from. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">After a night of sleep outside in the
      woods, I was rudly awakened by my mother, and this was the start of a day
      that would stay with me for a long time. My mother was shouting at me
      because I let a stranger stay at our house , yet somehow I knew he was not
      of an evil nature, and knew he was a man to be trusted. I got up from my
      bed of grass and went to find the warrior. In the tavern of course was the
      warrior, but not drinking as much so he must have felt better. I went to
      talk to the warrior and he introduced himself as Doyle, a fighter of many
      seasons. From there on we got to know each other well and he also helped
      me train to fight and gave me a few tips. He left the glades later that
      day leaving me with a sword a short sword of my own. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Later in the evening there was news of a
      poacher in the bear caves so the village made a party to go and slay the
      man for his crimes to the woodlands. The party went of in search of the
      poacher and found him and slayed him easily, but there seemed to be
      something strange going on. There was too much fuss made over this event,
      and when normally just a small party would go to search for a single
      poacher, now most of the vilaage was involved.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">As the party was on there way back, there
      was happiness from the village people as they got to the poacher before he
      killed more than one creature, yet all was not well. When I returned home
      I found blood over the kitchen floor, and I ran around in a panic trying
      to find my mother. I ran to my father and told him of the bad news. The
      villagers looked around the village for her, but she wasn't found, with
      just a slight trail from which our trackers could track. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">A small party of them set off, but I
      worried as days past and yet there was still no sign. As I waited, I
      trained hard with the hope to be able to go after the scouting party and
      help them search. Then, a few days later, they returned with some news.
      They found nothing but a cave with many gnolls, too many for us to kill,
      so I now just had hope. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">More days went past, as more search
      parties going to see what they can find. They still found nothing, only
      the death of members from the search party from endless scirmishes with
      the gnolls. With three weeks now past, they could not continue to spare
      the manpower, and they gave up. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">For weeks I trained hard, and my anger
      grew for the death of the gnolls. Soon the day arrived when I was allowed
      to go out into the real world, out of the glades, which had been my home
      for so long. I took my weapons, and started to travel over the surrounding
      hills where I found many creatures that wanted to kill me.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Here, is where I learnt to fight for real,
      as this was no practice ground, and with many retreats to the glade
      guards, I soon was able to kill the large rats and the horrid bats that
      plagued the area's wildlife. Another year had now past , and any hope of
      seeing my mother was long gone. I was now working for one of the
      villagers, delivering messages to Qeynos, which is a huge fortified city,
      one of the biggest on this side of Norrath.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">It was on a delivery run to Qeynos where I
      meet another of my friends who helped lead me to the right path of life.
      It was a bright summer day as I ran through the small Qeynos streets
      trying to get the message to its destination as soon as I could, and in
      doig so speeded around a corner, striaght into a very strong man. I was
      knocked down to the floor , and as I was feeling the anger of the pain of
      hitting the floor, a hand came down to me and the man pulled me up to my 
      feet. He then apologised for me falling to the ground, even though it was
      my fault. </FONT> </P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">He asked if I would join him for a drink
      at the tavern, and I agreed, but had to deliver my message first. Agreeing
      to the meet later in the day, I met the man in a tavern, the name of which
      escapes me right now, but I soon realised that the man had a very cool
      attitude to life and it was him who helped me get over my anger of my
      mothers death. His name was Bodi, he was a monk, a well built man who
      needed no weapons to fight as he was trained in hand to hand combat, a 
      very effective way to knock out and kill opponents with punches and kicks.
      He told me of many lands he'd been to and the things he'd seen and warned
      me of many things, helping me build my knowledge of the land of Norath.</FONT></P>
