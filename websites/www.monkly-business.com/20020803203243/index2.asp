Both Zinj and I are attending the Fan Faire in Boston that starts Tomorrow- so I doubt you will see us posting anything after say noon tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully we'll have some interesting things to report about the fan faire, PoP, EQ in general etc. with the possibility of taped workshops being avail and maybe some camcorder shots.

          <p class="MB_Body"><p>New patch today, in which they have hopefully sorted the bug/loophole that allowed you to type HTML commands in place of normal chat, allowing you to appear to be a GM, a zone wide message or anything else you could think off with different coloured chat. Also it was apparently able to freeze other players by changing font sizes or by typing other HTML commands.

<ul><i><p>We apologize for updating the servers on such short notice. As a bonus, /hitsmode functionality is now available in the new UI. Please check out the context (right-click) menus from New UI Chat windows. Hopefully this version is somewhat easier to understand.  

<p>** General Enhancements and Tweaks **

<p>- NPC and PC names display settings should be saved between sessions. <br>
- Bazaar Search Window is now resizable.<br>
- Disabled Begging and Stealing in the Bazaar<br>
- The New UI Train window no longer cuts off any skill names for INT casters.<br>

<p>- The EverQuest Team</i></ul>

<p>I have also added a new sticky message at the Top of the New Features forum, <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showMessage?topicID=132.topic">New UI Mod Links and Images</a>, in which I would like to create one post with all the UI site links, and your own modifications. Please read the post, and add your links and images (or someone else's with credit) and I will add them to the main site. Thanks!</p>

Absor posted this on the main EQ boards:
</p>
<i>
<ul>
I know a lot of folks would like to see the functionality of Hitsmode reappear in the new user interface.
</p>
<p>
So would we. In fact, we're working on something that would replace it and should have the same or better functionality. We hope to have it ready pretty soon, if possible before the new interface goes fully Live.

Also We at Monkly Business have made a new Forum - <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16"> New Features</a> to discuss new functions and additions to everquest since with the implementation of the new ui- we needed to add it for all the discussion of the new modifications and additions people are making.

<p>
Also Link of the Day - he was here before, now he is back:

<a href="http://www.ninjai.com"> Ninjai </a> is releasing new episodes and making the old episodes available as well/

          <p class="MB_Body"><p>This is new in a series off once in a while events, basically highlighting some of the guides that we have here on Monkly Business, which frankly are far too good. Zone Guides that contain maps, bestiaries, loot tables, 'How to' guides containing all the relevant information you need to know and more, guides that you may have overlooked, or not realised where here, or ones that where in places that you where not yet ready to go.

<p>Anyway. These 10 guides (in no particular order) are ones I would have liked to have written, and you should have them printed off, memorized, or listed as favourites on your second PC. If you haven't read them twice, or seen them at all, shame on you! Get reading them now!

<p><a href="http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/hole.htm">A guide to the Hole by Fdor.</a> - Huge amount of work done here, spawn points big lovely maps, recommended group layouts - more information than you can shake a stick at.

<p><a href="http://www.bluegrass.net/~jm72076/plague.html">The Qeynos Plague Investigation Quests by Lomein Noodles</a> - I personally loved these quests, and the fact that parts 5 and 6 are in place due to Jagged Pine is a good excuse to get this excellent guide updated with the new sections. Used this myself to get through some parts of the quest where I hadn't got a clue what to do next. 

<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/jaofos/">Krystalis Iksar Monk Shackle Quests</a> - Printed this superb guide off to have a go at the quests myself, but buckled under the pressure of ph4rming bone chips till my eyes bled. If you are Iksar however, then this is the guide for you.

<p><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=291.topic">Laotzu's Guide to Advanced Pulling</a> - Loads of pulling tricks and tips. How do you split one from another? Pulling Casters? Everything you need to make you look like the best puller in the world, and get personally asked for in groups :p

<p><a href="http://perso.respublica.fr/fayguardians/Guides/Factions/Factions.html">Anezka's Faction Guide</a> - Defiantly a screw loose here. Gaining faction with so many people is beyond the call of an Iksar's duty, but Anezka does it so bloody well. Plus, how do you turn a guide down that contains an Iksar female hugging a Halfling?

<p><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=951.topic">Guide to pulling the Halls of Testing by Glencannon</a> - Very nice indeed. Once my Internet connection is sorted out, I can do this properly, without fear of training my own people in a lag or linkdead induced rampage. Which ones to pull first, how to split tricky mobs and a lovely map make this a bloody good read.

<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lordhong/sky.htm">Catranizi's Plane of Sky Guide</a> - This behemoth covers EVERYTHING to do with the Plane of many islands. Mobs, quests, loot - you name it. Lots of work done and a quality guide to boot.

<p><a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=586.topic">Mr Meogi's Learn some HTML and how to make a signature</a> - Even though he should be banned for teaching people how to make signatures that cause Mod's to have nightmares with there garish and bold designs, and the 'Is my sig good?' threads that pop up due to the fact of his teachings, this is a fantastic help to anyone who wants to show off there masterpiece. Just make sure you read the sig rules first :p

<p><a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=109">Zorac's Coldain Ring Walkthrough</a> and <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=97">Coldain Ring Quest - A Solo guide by Blazeheliski</a> - I know, I am cheating here by listing 2, but they complement each other very well. I used both to help me get my Ring (still at 8, but half way through 9) and are the dog's danglies for anyone wanting their Coldain Rings.

<p><a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=114">Cele's Crystal Caverns Guide</a> - Another spectacular guide, enormously well detailed, and well deserving of anyone's time. Whether you are there to hunt or raise cash, or ph4rm Thurg potion parts, this will have information for you.

<p>Now, what are you waiting for! Print these off and have something entertaining to read on the way home from work.
