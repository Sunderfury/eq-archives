      have to be brought in by the Monk who handed in the Breath. He spawns
      indifferntly, and the key phrase 'I am prepared' is what makes him attack.
      The Monk can feign at this point, or move into the windmill and have a
      heavily buffed Tank babysit him into the Windmill. A Shadowknight is
      preferable, as non damaging aggro spells, such as AC debuffs prevent him
      from summoning the babysitter as he moves into the windmill.</FONT></P>

      Gwan knocks anyone back during the fight, so that they hit the wall (and

      runs out of the windmill and round to the back to try and hit the person
      through the wall rather than taking 2 steps forward. Stepping forward
      should bring him back running into the windmill.</FONT></FONT></P>
