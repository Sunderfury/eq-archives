<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Well, today was a fun day. I decided I should finally do something with that right hand column. So much studying of php and perl later, I have put up a server status list, just like they have on all the 'big boy' sites.</p><p>At the moment, the script is being called every time someone loads the page, and I need to rework it so it updates periodically. In the meantime, it will just be on the main page of the site, and not on the subsections, so I don't overload the EQ servers with the data requests, hehe.</p><p>Enjoy!</p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Well,  Scars of Velious was released yesterday, and the information is slowly coming in. Unfortunately I don't have a copy, as Verant decided to delay European release for 2 weeks after the US release.</p><p>Looks like a set of quest armor has been added for all classes, monks included. Information can be found <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm7.showMessage?topicID=997.topic">here</a> about that. Other items are being found too. Check the boards for up to date information.</p><p>One small update today, I have added a <a href="/skills/disc.html">Discipline list</a> in the <a href="/skills/index.html">skill guides</a> section, with up-to-date information, including the 2 new Velious disciplines and the revised text for Stonestance.</p></FONT></ul>

I am pleased to announce that a few hours ago, 78 days after the launch of the site, the 1,000,000th hit was registered.</p><p>I would like to thank everyone for your support during this time. I have plans for some exciting new features soon, and some new guides are in the works too.</p><p>Also, the messageboards have proven extremely popular. They are hosted on a different server, and thus not included in my hit count, and have themselves recieved over 3/4 million hits since they were launched 74 days ago.</p>

The first, and main thing, is the addition of a wonderful little utility designed for monks, in the <a href="/skills/index.html">Skill Guides</a> section. Written by Gjin of The Rathe, it uses your log file to measure your combat effectiveness and track skills. Check it out!</p><p>On a more personal note, I got myself a new computer on Saturday, and by the end of Sunday night, I had finished the last few steps I needed to do to get my <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~wulf/fists.jpg" target="_blank">Celestial Fists</a>. Yay Me! Many thanks go out to my guild, Immortal, and everyone else on Xegony who has helped me with various stages on the quest. The list is too long to start mentioning names.</p>

<ul>
<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Patch day comes around again. This one looks good for us monks!</p><p>A few snippets from the patch message:</p><p><b>Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum. Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction.</b></p><p>This one affected everyone, but its good news for us monks, as this bug made building some factions very difficult. Now Human monks will be accepted in Cabilis more easily, and Iksar monks will have a MUCH easier time building many factions, including those with humans</p><p><b>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill.</b></p>YES! Finally. It only took 6 months of complaining, but with the advent of the new Celestial Fists encouraging us to use Hand to Hand skill, it could no longer be ignored. WTG Verant for finally listening.</p><p>Anyway, servers will be down for a while, why not pop into the <a href="/chat/index.html">chat room</a> to discuss these changes while we wait?</p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Yesterday was quite possibly the worst day of my life.</p><p>It started innocently enough, with an average day at work, followed by an entertaining evening with some friends, but the story starts at about 10.30pm when I headed back to where my motorbike was parked (I ride a 600cc Bandit) to drive home.</p><p>Some car driver had hit my bike (parked in a bike bay on the side of the road) and then just driven off. About $2000 of damage. I did the standard things and went to the police to report the incident, so by the time I got home (by taxi) it was 00.30am.</p><p>I opened the door to my house to discover the place turned over. My PC that I use to play EQ on stolen, along with other electical appliances (TV, Video etc, etc) and the place looking like a scene from World War III.</p><p>So I called the Police out, and by the time they had arrived, looked the place over, taken a statement, filled in all the paperwork etc etc it was 4.00am.</p><p>I went to bed. Let me tell you, it is a VERY freaky experience trying to sleep in  a house that has just been broken into.</p><p>So, I get up for work at 7.00am, and realise I dont have a bike to ride into work on, and no cash to get a taxi, so I get dressed and head to the Bank. I put my card in the cash machine, which promptly swallows it, gives some lame excuse about a technical fault, and then sits there smugly staring at me.</p><p>I am a strong believer in Karma, and someone somewhere owes me BIG for last night. I think I'll go buy a lottery ticket....</p></FONT></ul>
