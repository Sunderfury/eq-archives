mid-day sun. The air was dry and the smell of tree pollen filled my
nose. I briefly admired the entrance to my home of Cabilis. I always
hated to leave, but I snapped myself out of my musings quickly enough.
There was work to be done.</p><p>I began walking between the buildings that had grown up outside of town.
The ever vigilant guards had done an impressive job in keeping the local
bandits and numerous hostile animals in the area away from town, even if
not banished entirely. In fact, this was about the only safe haven in
the area. As I passed the last building I could feel my skin tighten as
my senses snapped into full wakefulness. I began to hunt.</p><p>I moved to the east in search of my latest prey. I was looking for more
of the silken strands that I need for my tailoring trade. I laughed
silently to myself as I thought of the absurdity of it. A tailor. As
much as I hated following in my predecessors footsteps, the simple truth
was I needed the skill. As if to punctuate my thought, I heard my cloth
jerkin rustle slightly in the wind. I instantly was in a defensive
crouch, silently cursing myself for forgetting. Seeing that my own
clothes had not betrayed me this time, I tightened by belt, tucking in
the folds of the garment to avoid any further outbursts. Silk would not
have behaved so disloyally, hence my tedious pursuits. I moved on, this
time silently.</p><p>A short time later, I came upon my quarry. Several large bonecrawlers
plodded about the area in their tireless search for food. Despite the
fact that these creatures often held copious amounts of silk in their
oversized abdomens, I had never even once seen a web. Given the sheer
size of these creatures, I considered this a good thing and did not
question it. Perhaps a 40 foot web would rather be like advertising
"Hey, I am a big juicy spider over here. Come eat me" and so natural
selection prompted the brighter ones of the species to give it up but
the genetics of it just hadn't had time to catch up. I didn't care.
Natural selection was about to be shown that you can't plan for
everything, especially a monk with a need.</p><p><hr width="75%"></p><p>"Quit your squirming," I thought. I had the creature on its back and I
was reaching for the hard part of the carapace where the abdomen joins
with the hind legs. That was the best spot to use when trying to get at
the innards. One tough pull and the belly springs open like a can of
fish bait. Finding my hold, I did so and was greeted with the smell that
accompanies the successful accomplishment such a task. Being used to it,
I moved on hurriedly, not wanting to waste time as I had not had much
luck so far today. Moving aside intestines, I came across the egg sack,
which was a common landmark I used to locate the spinners. This sack was
engorged and movement could be seen just past the thin protective
membrane. The beast screamed and convulsed violently as I tore the sack
away and discarded it on the ground. The kicking legs were beginning to
slow me down so I put my fist through its brain as I felt for the
spinners with my other hand. This time, I was more successful. Both
spinners were thick with the milky white substance which, when properly
dried, could be spun into the silk that I needed. Placing them gingerly
in my pack, I rose and turned to search out new prey.</p><p>As I walked past the still twitching egg sack, I knelt briefly and tore
it open, releasing dozens of hatchlings of varying stages of
development. Many lay motionless while others limped away blindly at
varying speeds and in all directions. Perhaps I was feeling a slight
pang of guilt. I did just murder their mother after all. Maybe I really
did care a little. Or, more likely, I was just giving them a chance to
fatten up. After all, I was going to have to hunt something next season.
Seeing that I was still alone, I began my hunt again, with the
occasional crunching sound greeting my ears as I stalked away.</p><p><hr width="75%"></p><p>It was growing late and even though my sack was not yet full, it was
time to return to town. Disgusted by my poor luck, I headed towards the
valley referred to as "the pit" by the locals on my way towards Cabilis.
The pit was a place densely populated by the local animal life as the
high walls provided protection from the heat and from many predators,
but not all. Entering from the North, I headed across the wide flat
space, my keen night vision and sense of smell alerting me to the
scurrying life all around me. I ignored much of these creatures as they
did not pose any threat and most would be busy trying to avoid me.</p><p>As I walked, I could occasionally hear the faint screams of other young
Iksars who had either wandered into the pit by mistake, or whom found
themselves unable to cope with the often silent death that awaited the
untrained inside. For the most part I ignored them. Survival of the
fittest is what has kept our race strong throughout the centuries, even
if it did keep our numbers low. A monk learns to rely on himself for
survival, not weapons, not friends, and not the guards. Weapons break,
friends are often more trouble than they are worth (many promising
swifttails lost their lives over foolish attempts at saving another's
life), and the local milita stayed at the town limits for the most part.
Their job was to protect the weak, the old, and the riches that are kept
within the town itself - not to coddle or babysit those who could not
fend for themselves.</p><p>I was about half of the way across the pit when I smelled blood in the
air nearby. It was definitely Iksar blood and as the scent was wafting
towards me from the South, the direction I was headed in anyway, I moved
silently closer. After a few minutes of travel, I began to see two
figures up ahead locked in conflict. As I approached, I found a young
Iksar I recognized from town grappling with what I could only guess to
be one of the many brigands that patrolled this area searching for
profit. The young swifttail seemed to have the upper hand although she
was bleeding from numerous wounds. As I approached, her lips curled into
a smile. It seemed that she thought I had arrived to help her out. I
assume that the brigand did as well as he immediately ran off to the
south. Preparing to make chase, the female turned to me and spoke.</p><p>"Come my brother, we sshhall finisshh this beast together," she hissed.
I walked past her without acknowledgement. This was not of my concern
and I longed to get to town to wash the green slime of the days' toil
off my scales. Puzzled, not understanding my lack of response, she moved
to step along side of me at a trot eager to finish this off. I guess she
decided that I must not have heard her so she repeated herself with a
tone of irritation. While not actually a mute, I have been accused of
being so on several occasions and I didn't see this as the appropriate
time to prove that argument wrong. I walked on silently. Finally
exasperated, and not wanting to lose her quarry, the young Iksar flashed
a rude hand gesture and ran off in the direction of the escaping
brigand.</p><p>A short time later I came across her corpse. Her pack had been picked
clean and her tail had been removed, as was often the custom of brigands
who have been victorious in combat. It seemed a rather odd practice to
me as doing so served no purpose…she was already dead. There were rumors
that some would eat the tails of the fallen as a sign of contempt for
their weakness. Personally, I had better things to do with my time than
to insult the dead, however, to the victor goes the spoils and she
obviously was to have no more use of it. Without stopping to inspect the
corpse further, I continued on.</p><p><hr width="75%"></p><p>I came across their camp a short while later.  The trio of Iksar
brigands sat huddled around a small fire as they gestured back and forth
to each other.  They seemed to be excited, or perhaps pleased with
themselves.  I suppose I could  have just walked past them, but even as
I thought to myself that I was in a hurry to get back,  I found myself
stepping into the light of the fire.  Sure, they were Iksars and thus we
shared a bond of blood, but then again, I needed the practice.</p><p>The first one died before he could get to his feet.  His neck broke
easily and he slumped forward onto the fire.  The second one was a
little more alert and came at me quickly, a little too quickly.  He was
good.  I ducked another blow and stepped to his side, putting him
between me and the third one who had produced a rather intimidating
looking blade.  Spinning to the right, I forced the quick one to stumble
over my tail, falling backwards towards the fire.  However, the brigand
merely used his less than fortunate comrade as a bridge and regained his
balance on the opposite side of the fire pit.  Damn.  The third one came
at me swinging wildly, which I took as a good thing.  If he had known
how to really use that thing I might have been in trouble.  Instead, I
broke his arm in three places, not because I had to really but more
because I just could.  Dropping the ground briefly, I landed a forearm
on his knee which I heard pop as the bone leapt free of the socket.  I
was done with him.</p><p>I rejoined the fight with the big one and although he was good, I could
see that it was only going to be a matter of time.  I waited him out as
we attacked and countered.  I knew he would eventually make a mistake.
The claws on my feet tore 3 gaping holes in his neck as I spun through
my kick.  I watched him sag to the ground as his blood flowed out of his
body.  Rooting through their camp revealed very little of interest other
than a female iksar tail and a few spider silk.  I smiled to myself as I
gathered the silk into my pack.  This hadn't been a waste of time after
all.  As I headed off back towards town, the scent of cooking meat
filled my nostrils and the echoing cries of a badly broken Iksar in my
ears.</p><p><hr></p><p>As I strode into the dim light at the city gates, I reflected on the
day.  I didn't have the best of luck early on, but it got better.  My
body felt good after having gotten some exercise, but I badly needed a
good soaking.  I was looking forward to getting to my home to immerse
myself in the geothermally heated pool and to wipe the blood and sweat
of the day off myself.  At least none of the blood was mine and that in
and of it self makes for a successful outing.  As I hefted my pack of
silks over my shoulder, my good mood began to disappear as quickly as it
had come on.  The downside of such an enjoyable day is the true work
that begins each night before starting the cycle all over again.  I
shook my head in disgust with myself.  No Iksar should have to be a
tailor.</p>
