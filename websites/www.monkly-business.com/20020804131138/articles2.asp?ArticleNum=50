<LI>Everything is camped.
<LI>Your corpse will always end up halfway inside a mountain, nowhere in sight of the roads, or under a tree.
<LI>The skeleton in front of you is there to distract you from the kodiak approaching behind you.
<LI>If your attack is going really well, you are in an ambush.
<LI>If the MOBs are within range, so are you.
<LI>The tougher MOBs invariably attack on two occasions:> 
<ul><LI>when they're ready.
<LI>when you're not.</UL>
<LI>One MOB is never enough, but two can be entirely too many.
<LI>The MOB is not retreating; it's just going to get its friends.
<LI>The MOBs you never encounter when armed and buffed always appear  during your corpse run.
<LI>The MOB you've been camping for hours always spawns 18 seconds after you leave.
<LI>Teamwork is essential; it gives the MOBs other people to attack.
<LI>Don't ever be the first, don't ever be the last, and don't ever volunteer to do anything.
<LI>For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism.
<LI>The greatest danger to your group is a Paladin with a map and a> plan.
<LI>When the going gets tough, the tank gets linkdead.
<LI>A group without healers or bandages is not a group for long.
<LI>Your buffs will fade when you need them the most.
<LI>Whenever you have plenty of mana, you never miss. Whenever you are low on mana, every spell fizzles. 
<LI>When in doubt, gate.
<LI>There is not a single bathroom in all of Norrath.
<LI>The Armor Class of a piece of armor is inversely proportional as to how good it looks on you.
<LI>The item that you want the most drops the rarest.
<LI>The item that you want the most is out of your price range.
<LI>The item that you want the most was sold at an auction while you were offline.
<LI>The item that you want the most was picked up by some moron who didn't know the definition of "No Drop".
<LI>The item you'll need tomorrow is No Rent.
<LI>The item you accidentally drop will be the most valuable/powerful/important item you carry.
<LI>If you can afford it, it's not for sale.
<LI>If you want two of them, it's a Lore item.
<LI>If you want to sell it, it's a No Drop item.
<LI>The High Quality Bear Skin drops every 28 days, the same schedule as PMS. Coincidence?
<LI>Even greens kill.
<LI>Backstab means never having to say you're sorry.
<LI>A bow without arrows seems awfully heavy all of a sudden.
<LI>Merchants are perfectly capable of kicking tail and taking names.
<LI>Trains have the right of way.
<LI>If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid.
<LI>The guards are never there when you need them.
<LI>Misuse of a combine button in a hurry = highly colorful language.
<LI>The time it takes to upload the newest patch is directly proportional to your eagerness to log on.
<LI>No two people have ever agreed on a single, precise definition of a twink. 
<LI>Never forget that your newbie weapon was crafted by the lowest bidder. 
<LI>A roleplayer drinks to increase his alcohol tolerance; an idiot does it in the Kelethin treetops.
<LI>Having a tenth of a bubble of health left is Nature's way of telling you to slow down.
<LI>Gnome wizards are proof positive that size does not matter.
<LI>The greatest mystery in Norrath is how NPCs figure out what religion you are just by looking at you.
<LI>Every shaman on Norrath at one point in his or her life has done the pig joke when someone asked for a SOW.
<LI>Only twelve people in all of Norrath are truly happy with their last names. 
<LI>The last bubble takes forever to fill.
<LI>It is somehow discouraging to realize that Qeynos is "SonyEQ"
spelled backwards.</OL>
