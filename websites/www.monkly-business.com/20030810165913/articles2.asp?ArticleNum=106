          <p class="MB_SubHead">Harmot vs. Cyanin (fight scene) - by Harmot</p>
          <ul>
            <p class="MB_Body"> 
              "But first, let's duel."<p>Cyanin took an offensive pose, raising his left arm above his head and his left down at the level of his knees, through his arms forming the letter "C"; placing his left leg behind him and his right forward, he crouched low, his thighs parallel to the ground. As Cyanin slowly approached, Harmot began to move in a way Cyanin had never taught him.<p>'He is strong, capable of much more then I ever could' Cyanin thought.<p>Harmot continued his movements unknown to Cyanin; moving his arms in circles, with his palms perpendicular to his arms, with all this Harmot's feet were moving back and forth, stumbling almost, circling around Cyanin slowly but surely.<p>'Incredible! The form of the drunken master!' Cyanin thought in awe.<p>"Where did you learn that form Harmot?"<p>"I watched monks using this form in Freeport, when I was small."<p>Before Cyanin could change to a defensive stance Harmot pulled his arms closer to his chest and altered his foot stance to become more balanced, changing his form to a defensive stance.<p>At this time a crowd had formed around the two friends dueling.<p>Cyanin charged, hands moving fast punching ferociously at Harmot's chest and shoulder area. Harmot, blocking many of the punches, ducked under one of the head shots and swept his foot behind Cyanin towards the back of his knees, bringing him to the ground.<p>Cyanin did not move, Harmot was horrified for Cyanin had hit his head on the fall to the ground.<p>"Cleric! Get a cleric!" He shouted.<p>As the cleric appeared through the crowd of observers Harmot turned his back on his friend to tell the cleric what happened. Just as this happened he felt a stone-hard punch in the head and a punch in his lower back, causing him to fly forward and smash into the tree-center of the large platform. Harmot felt the bones in his left hand crush.<p>"Remember your new found skill Harmot, the ability to feign death."<p>Harmot stumbled to his feet, his hand in pain.<p>'Must block out pain, pain cann nnnot succeed over me' He thought to himself.<p>Harmot crouched low, ready to pounce, Cyanin mimicked his stance and movements exactly. Harmot rushes forward a step, Cyanin would do the same. Harmot then sat on the ground with his back to Cyanin, giving him a chance to attack. Cyanin did, just what Harmot wanted. As Cyanin jumped headfirst toward Harmot, Harmot sprung up and did a back flip, landing just behind Cyanin, throwing three punches to the head, all with his right hand, punches getting faster and faster, moving all over Cyanin's body. One punch to the rib, another to the thigh, a third to his back, then Harmot widged his knee into the back of Cyanin's knee causing him to fall to his knees. At this Cyanin fell to his face, whispering, "Well done friend, Well done."<p>"Cleric!" was the last thing Cyanin heard from Harmot.
