    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">As a ranger you are expected to know your
      way around because a ranger should always have a good sense of direction,
      so here is some help so you don't get lost (which can help even if your
      not a ranger.) First the very best way to not get lost, is every where you
      travel to remember things you pass such as a building or a statue or clump
      of trees or a clearing or anything that will help you know that you've
      already seen this before and as you go over a zone you'll soon know all
      the short cuts all the places to sell and fight which helps you and anyone
      who asks you (also making you look like an expert ranger). </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Another thing you can do is if you are
      holding a weapon with a handle and a point end (even a mace will do) then
      throw it to the floor and look at the way its pointing which ever the way
      the point end points to is true north and this has helped me before so it
      does work and is useful unless you haven't got any weapons. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Another thing you can do is just follow
      paths but that won't teach you anything about traveling even if you don't
      follow paths and you get lost you will learn where your going or will know
      that , that way is a dead end or a waste of time etc. The final best way
      to know where things are is to use location which you can make a quick
      button, by making the command as /loc in the window if you right click on
      a button you don't use such as anon. When you press this button it will
      give you your longitude and latitude (example -3918.46 +409.83 or +1094.04
      +5038.94 and so on). So now what you do is stand outside a shop you may
      wish to return to and press your button (/loc) and write down the numbers
      then if your somewhere else in the same zone you can just keep pressing
      the loc button and watch the numbers go up or down then just walk in the
      direction in which the numbers will meet the same as you've written down
      and there you go you will be back to the shop you wanted to return to.
      Then of course you've got your trusty radar your tracking which you can
      use to find people or monsters or even to track a big monster you wish to
      keep out the way of and its always useful to know that the big 35 level
      giant is coming right at you! </FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">You wont get your spells till level 9th so
      the wait is long but when you get your first spells it bursts new life
      into your ranger which seems like a fighter till now. First thing you must
      do at level 9 is return to your guild master and learn all five spell
      casting categories Abjure, Alter, Conjure, Divinate, and Evoke and all
      will be used very soon so it is worth using those five level points to get
      all five skills. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">All your first spells will fit into your
      casting slots so put them all in as you will use them all at different
      times. Rather then go into detail over all of the Ranger spells available
      at each level, go to one of the links from my page, all of which have
      spell info on them.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B><U>A Guide to Weapons:</U></B>
      </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">As a ranger you have one of the best array
      or weapon choice and you can get many unique weapons that many classes
      cannot use and you can use all types of weapon fighting styles such as two
      handed, one handed in both blunt and slashing. Archery skill is the best,
      as we can get criticals with our bows, so a bow is worth using a lot. At
      later levels we get duel wield and double attack, which not many classes
      get both of. So as a Ranger you get the best choices of weapon styles. I
      personally use two whips, but keep my two handed slash weapon to practice
      with, and now at level 18 i've got a one handed slash skill of 95 and a
      two handed slash skill of about 87.It is a good idea to use other weapons
      so to be flexable, as there are many good 2 Handed weapons out there, or
      possibly to be introduced. Obviously its your choice, so play as you wish,
      as my Barbarian Warrioir friend Luthior has always used a two handed slash
      weapon, even though warriors can duel wield, but as he is a stubern
      Barberian, I will leave him be with his choice in weaponry. </FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">On this subject you may do as you wish
      because no two people are the same, but heres a short guide to how I play
      as Salas. Rangers are of a kind nature but can be very deadly if needed.
      We should look to animals as friends like a druid as we are also woodsman
      (or woodswomen,) and should never use animals as a way to gain any
      experiance and never to hunt them or treat them in a cruel manner after
      all they live in our woods also. We use our stealth skills a lot to pass 
      through places un-noticed or to hide to ambush a stupid orc or gnoll and
      we use our survival skills such as finding food which lowers the cost of
      long traveling or waiting. Finally we use our sense of direction and
      tracking to find who or what we need more quickly. </FONT></P>
