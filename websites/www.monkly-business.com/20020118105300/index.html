          <p class="MB_Body"><p>I have changed the 'rules' for posting in Guides and Tactics slightly, and I just want you all to be aware.

<ul>

<p> <b>Submission Guidelines Jan 2002</b>

<p> If you would like to submit an article to the site, or have any comments on existing content, then email them <a href="mailto:guides@monkly-business.com">HERE</a>.

<p> Guides MUST be posted here first before they are submitted to the main site, allowing you the guide writer to add comments passed on by other players.

<p> We would like guides to follow a simalar format, with samples shown below. If your guide (more related to Hunting guides) already exsists, PLEASE DO NOT POST A SEPERATE one. Post it within the same topic.

<p> eg. 'Solo guide: Quelious Monk 1 to 30' written by Zinj, does not require a seperate 'Solo guide: Quelious Monk 1 to 30' written by Bodi, no matter how much he likes to see his name in lights.

<p> Sample Thread headings:

<p> Solo Guide: xxxxxx Monk (level) to (level) <br>
Level Guide: (Continent): (level) to (level) <br>
Quest Guide: -Quest-

<p> <b>THIS FORUM IS HEAVILY MODERATED !</b>

<p> Do not complain if your post has been moved or even deleted if you do not read these instructions. Bumps and questions will be deleted or incorporated into threads depending on relevance.

<p> No content commentary will also be deleted from posts here, and also the cropping of peoples sigs within threads (one per person and possibly only the person who created the thread), and large ones to be culled to allow easier printing.

<p> If you find your hints and tactics posts 'missing'; its very likely a Moderator has consolidated a parallel thread. (ie you have posted the same subject as someone else but have not checked back to see whether it has been done before.) This is because all like information placed in one thread is a lot easier to find and to use than digging through a couple hundred different more or less identical threads. So, if you're going to post, please check to see if someone hasn't posted it already, or if it can go under a thread already opened on that topic.

<p> This forum is delibaratly not Read Only, as sometimes people post worthy extra information to the original post, so will remain open to all to add further comment.

<p> <b>Do Not Ask Questions Here</b>

<p> Please obey the board rules and only post guides here. If you have a question to ask, please ask it in the relevant forum, NOT in here.

<p> <b>Other information</b>

<p>This forum is for people to post guides on how to <b>do</b> something --rasing a trade skill quickly, raise difficult factions, recomendations for equipment/resist gear/luggage, what quests to do when.

<p> And a final word to say that Your post could be deleted or moved, if in the wrong forum, depending upon the whim of the Moderator at the time.

<p> On Behalf of <br>
Monkly Business Admin and Moderators.


<p><i>Note: This board is in 'construction' and may look more messy than it should as I try and consolidate and condense everything, sorry for any inconvience caused. </i></ul>

<p>I hope at the end of this, we will have a Guides and Tactics forum will be easily searched (as we all know EZBoards is crap) to find what you need.
</p>

From the Everquest Developers forum: from the looks and tone of the post, its probably going to be retroactive as well.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<i>
We have reviewed Ghoulbane and SoulFire and will be making some changes to these items with the next patch.
</p>
<p>
Ghoulbane will become No Drop and SoulFire will require the proper Race/Class to activate.
</p>
<p>
We wanted to make you aware of these changes before we made them. These weapons are really intended to be holy weapons, and these changes should make them exclusive to Paladins. We will also be reviewing the quest to make certain that it is working after the patch.

          <p class="MB_Body"><p>"Monk message board that used to be a wonderful site for news and information but has greatly degenerated "

<p>Was on a guild website (no it doesnt matter which one it was) with a link to Monkly Business. This echoes what I said earlier about posts.

<p>We need to get back the 'honour' that went with the prestige Monk Board. 

<p>Discussions on Iksar vs Human are okay as long as they dont degenerate into a flamefest, and also that when a Human Monk points out facts, that Iksar dont retaliate with 'You are just jealous/have tail envy' or other drivel.

<p>New threads on subjects that are current. I have just seen 2 new threads on current topics. Why create a NEW THREAD on a current topic? Keep it all together! We dont want 4 threads on the same bloody topic, no matter what your new spin is! 

<p>Also, I have had a few emails regarding new content, but not as many as once I was getting. I know that you are exploring Luclin, but I want your hunting and quest guides still!

<p>Then perhaps we can get that link comment above changed......

          <p class="MB_Body"><p>Added another <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=154">Temple of Veeshan</a> Guide to the Zone Guide section, as the one we already had was lacking maps (due to dead links).

<p>The new one added is due to me possibly going on my first ToV raid, and I want to know all about it, and so, with the help of my friendly search engine Google, I present this one.

<p> The guide looks very nice one indeed, with maps, Main Taunt/Main Assist suggestions, and lots of other helpful info. Seperate pages from this also show drops, Quests and even what the quest armour looks like worn. 

<p>Take a look, and see what you think. If your guild has a better one, or with different tactics, please send them to me at the usual address, and I will add them in.

<p>Edit: Bloody Geocities.....The usual warnings apply I am afraid, I was looking at something, then get hit by the familiar warning "This webpage is very busy try again..." -- its worth the wait though IMO.</p>

          <p class="MB_Body"><p>Unstickied a load of the Hunting guides in Guides and Tactics, will get around to editing and consolidating more when I can, but I reckon I have cleaned 20 threads and made the Hunting guides we have left more informative.

<p>I also hope to re-edit the sticky at the begining of each section (hopefully an appropriate FAQ will be included as well) to reflect the kind of posts and format we would like to see within the specific forum. 

<p>Now to educate people to read them in the first place..... </p>
