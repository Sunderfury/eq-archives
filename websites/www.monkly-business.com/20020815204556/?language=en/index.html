          <p class="MB_Body"><p>.....have now been added to the main site in <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=5">Skills: Monk</a>. I have made a few adjustments to that section and <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=7">Monks in Norrath</a>, making the Skills: Monk section the first point of call for all things Monkly (ie skills, alt xp, disciplines, Hand to Hand ratios, Iksar vs Human diferences...) and Monks in Norrath is grouping information, raid info, zone info and money making tips.

<p>I have also slightly re-edited the stickied thread in the Newbie zone of the Forum boards as well, found <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm6.showMessage?topicID=1540.topic">here</a> to help those new to the brotherhood find there path so to speak.

<p>I am still in the process of sorting out my Coldain Ring guide, going through logs of my progress, as well as re-writing sections, and there are one or two other guides that need little touch-ups which I will get to soon. Unfortunatly, it seems my Benevolence guide may never be 'finished' as we (my guild) started on the North Wing of ToV last night, so I will have to wear a vox for that much longer...but seeing the spoogeworthy drops there, I think I will be ok. 

<p>Oh, and I finally hit level 59 - just a year or so approx till 60 :p

          <p class="MB_Body"><p>Based on the recent Dain pulling thread, and the 'guide' that we have in Guides and Tactics, it seems that it is a bit lacking, and also (according to the writer) possibly exploitive.

<p>This is obviously not very good, and so we need a replacement, of which must follow these additional requirements - not exploitive, and been proof read at least twice.

<p>Due to my email being used as a rubbish bin for suspect files and p0rn links, please post any guides in Guides and Tactics, and the best one will be added to the site.

<p>Thanks. Oh, and any other guides please feel free to post there as well. </p>

Also Scott Hartsman said this about the exploit and tomrorow's patch:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<i>
I'm not going to repeat the things that Alan's already stated so well. 99.9% of the people who play EverQuest do so in a fair manner, and agree that there is no room for cheating as part of EverQuest. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this message is addressed to the other 0.01%. 
</p>
<p>
If you've "accidentally" ended up with items equipped that your race or class cannot normally equip, and/or have any items that haven't been earned in the lines of acceptable gameplay under the EULA, we strongly recommend that you log in your character before tonight's patch and unequip any mismatched items and delete any duplicates. 
</p>
<p>
As of tomorrow's patch, please do not be surprised when items gained in an illicit manner and/or wrongly equipped are creatively, forcibly un-equipped. 
</p>
<p>
We already have logs of who's done what, and we'd like to extend an opportunity to those who may have tried something out "just for fun" to take their actions back. 
</p>
<p>
As a team, we've been congratulated quite a bit lately for many of the positive changes that we've been making to the game, and we're glad to continue to improve upon what we still believe is the most enjoyable online game out there. 
</p>
<p>
However, please do not mistake our intent. The rule does stand: If you cheat to get around the system, you must be willing to accept the consequences. 
</p>
<p>
Cheat in EverQuest; Bad Things Happen. 
</p>
<p>
Once again, to the vast majority of people who play EverQuest in the true spirit of the game, we're sorry that we've had to take up your time with this. 
</p>
<p>
We thank everyone who has submitted /bug reports and feedback here in the Dev Corner on this issue. No punitive action has been or will be taken against those who discover and report bugs, and stop taking advantage of them. 
</p>
<p>
Thank you.

Forcibly and Creatively means if you are currently WEARING an item in the wrong slot or an item your class cannot use,,say HELLO to your bind point as you DIE(no xp loss unfortunately) and get sent there upon login.

Found this tidbit at CastersRealm:
</p>
<p>
Hi all, 
</p>
<p>
Thought you'd be interested to know that we're adding in Luclin ports and putting them on Test server this weekend. These spells will be available to both druids and wizards as convenient vendor sold scrolls. 
</p>
<p>
We've added a Nexus port for druids, and ports to Dawnshroud, Twilight Sea, and Grimling Forest for wizards and druids. This should help cut the travel time to the remote areas of Luclin, and it's something that a lot of players have been asking for. 
</p>
<p>
Take care, 
</p>
<p>
- Rich
