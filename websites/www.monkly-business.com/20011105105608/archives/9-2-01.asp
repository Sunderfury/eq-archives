<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>No update today, just some Monk news.</p><p>Absor opened the thread on whineplay on Monday (2 days early) and it has been busy indeed. A compilation post from the messageboards here was posted, and a lot of support was given to it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the way the EQ board system works means that giving a link is difficult, as they lock each thread as it reaches 250 posts, so you might find this link is to a locked thread, but anyway, <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085.html">click here</a> to view the current thread as of today.</p><p>On page 3 of this thread, Absor posts his first set of replies, and.... I have to say, I am dissapointed. The man seems to have NO CLUE as to what a monk is, what Verants own 'vision' is for us even, he freely admits this:</p><p><ul><i>I'll have to find out what the, um.., Vision&#8482; is for this class</i></ul></p>Whats up with that? This is the man charged with sorting through hundreds and hundreds of posts about the monk class, identifying the wheat from the chaff, and presenting the ones he decides are worthy of mention to the tuning team.</p><p>So, what does he pick out? Someone suggested monks should get critical hits on our throwing (doh!)...</p><ul><i>Interesting idea. This can also be used to increase monks damage a bit. That it, IF it needs to be increased. But if anyone is going to be the master of throwing, it may as well be monks.</i></ul></p><p>Not only does that show a clear ignorance about how monks work, but if I was a rogue reading that, knowing this guy was in charge of their class too, that would scare me.<p>On a more fun note, It is the final of the Monk 'Best of the Best' tournament this Sunday, starting at 12pm PST. Yours truly has been granted permission to attend as a representative of this site, so expect an article early next week with full pictures and commentary.</p></FONT></ul>

Finally got a few minutes today to update some content.</p><p>Ive added 1 item to the humour section (the mammoth image), 2 guides to the Skill Guides section (The combat guides, 2 done, 1 more to be added soon!), plus I fixed the links on the rant pages and also fixed the java for the chat room.</p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Firstly, welcome to the new year. Hope you all had an enjoyable time.</p><p>Sorry for the lack of updates over the last few weeks. I've been very busy in Real Life&#8482; and not had a chance. I have been submitted some great stuff over christmas and the new year, and I intend to find the time to update the site with the new content tomorrow.</p><p>Also, a few pages are 'broken' and I will be fixing those tomorrow too. The chat interface lost some of the javascript when I converted to php (silly me) which 'broke' it, and one of the rants has broken links all over it.</p><p>Oh, and lastly, happy birthday me!</p></FONT></ul>

Not me, YOU. Without the support, via submissions, message board and chat room, even down to people spreading word of the site within the game and by word of mouth, it would never have become the giant that it has.</p><p>This is Zadkiel, signing off until next week.</p></FONT></ul>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#8b1a1a"><p>Well, it's that time of the year again, full of extravagance and over-indulgence.</p><p>I have momentarily emerged from my alcoholic-blurred state, to put up some new content that has been submitted. I will have to be brief, as I feel a desire to go talk to god on the great white porcelain telephone.</p><p>We have a new picture in the <a href="/humour/index.asp">humour section</a>, a new file in the <a href="/equipment/index.asp">equipment section</a> and a new <a href="/quests/index.asp">quest guide.</a> The new articles are at the bottom of each page.</p><p>One last comment before I go, when making submissions, PLEASE do not use html editors or word processors to add in the content to the template I provide. It takes me 10 times as long to strip out all the rubbish they add to the code than it would to just type it out from scratch. I was sent a wonderful story that unfortunately has MS Word encoding all over it, and I simply cant be bothered to strip it all out.</p><p>If you don't know how to use a text editor to work with an html file, then please just submit it as plain text, and let me do the work, saves me a lot of time in the long run.</p></FONT></ul>

If you find any broken links, it means I screwed up, please email me with details of the link that is broken so I can fix it.
