<p>Frequently asked questions on the Monkly-Business Boards.

<h3>Contents</h3>

<p>This FAQ originated as a EZBoard thread that started because the monkly-business boards were becoming very cluttered with the same questions, over and over again.

<p>The most recent version of this FAQ can be found as a stickied post in the <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=959.topic">Guides and Tactics</a> forum, and updates added there will be incorporated here. 

<p>The FAQ is spread across 2 articles, and the second part, containing Guides and Tactics, Skills and Stats, information about these boards, and misc info can be found <a  href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=164"> >>here<< </a>

<h3><a name="quests">Monk Quests</a></h3>
<p><b><a name="mq1">Q: Is Brother Qwinn broken?</a></b>

<p>A: Probably not. It's not at all unheard of for Qwinn to go long periods without spawning, especially when there's a lot of patching going on. Since he has no PH that we're aware of, you'll just have to park in SK and/or bother someone with tracking. If a Guide or GM tells you he's on vacation, or is broken, chances are that they're just not familiar with how the quest/NPC works, and is making something up.  Note:  a recent patch (January 23) increased Qwinn's spawn rate, so he should be less of a problem now.

<p><b><a name="mq2">Q: How do I get the Ancient Cyclops to spawn for JBoots?</a></b>

<p>A: Check out the guide <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=494.topic" target=new>here</a>.

<p><b><a name="mq3">Q: Is Trunt/Eejag/Raster/Zephyl/whatever doable with this group/solo?</a></b>

<p>A: Depends on group layout/your equipment.  Statistics and abilities of the mobs are posted in various threads and guides, it should be easy for you to figure out on yourself how much power you need for what mob.  <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=618.topic" target=new>Keyeluke's guide on Zephyl ganking</a> will help you here, and <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=1" target=new>Bodi's Epic Guides</a> will help you with the others.



<p><b><a name="mq4">Q: Can I kill Brother Zephyl and Brother Qwinn for the Robe of the Lost Circle?</a></b>

<p>A: Yes, you can; however, they don't drop it every time.  Also, they won't always appear to be wearing it, even if they have it -- if you zoned in after they spawn, they won't show as wearing it.



<p><b><a name="mq5">Q: <i>Should</i> I kill Brother Zephyl or Brother Qwinn for my RotLC?</a></b>

<p>A: Please don't kill Qwinn.  He's hard enough to find without people killing him, and Zephyl is easy to spawn.  If you want to kill Zephyl, go right ahead. It's up to you whether you want to spend the time camping Raster/Targin, or kill Bro Z. Nobody cares how you get your epic (as long as you don't kill Qwinn), so long as you're honorable about it towards other players. Posting this question on MB serves only to create flame wars. 



<p><b><a name="mq6">Q: How do I get Coldain Ring (insert number)?</a></b>

<p>A: There are a number of excellent ring guides around, including <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=97" target=new>this one</a> for the first 7 solo, and <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=109" target=new>part one</a> and <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=108" target=new>part two</a> of another.



<p> <b><a name="mq7">Q: I am trying to do this quest -- anyone know how it works?</a></b>

<p>A: If we do, the answer will be either on the <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm7" target=new>Monk Quest Forum</a>, the <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=2" target=new>Monk Quests Page</a>, the <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=1" target=new>Epic Quest page</a>, or the <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles.asp?ArticleId=3" target=new>General Quests Page</a>.  Otherwise, please post in the Quests forum, and we'll all get working on it!



<p><b><a name="mq8">Q: Does Multi-Questing still work?</a></b>

<p>A: Yes. Any quest where the reward is given after multiple items are handed in is multi-questable, with the person handing in the last piece of the quest items gaining the item.



<p><b><a name="mq9">Q: No, Multi-Questing must be broken, Brother Balatin just ate my Robe of the Lost Circle, and the 2 pipes I was getting multi-quested.</a></b>

<p>A: No, multiquesting is fine. You just had charm break before the final trade in, causing an memwipe of any no-drop items that were handed in. Next time, use a fixed duration charm.



<p><b><a name="mq10">Q: No, I'm <i>sure</i> multiquesting is broken!  I just tried to get some velious armour, and the MQ didn't work!</a></b>

<p>A: Everyone who hands in an item for a multiquest must have the faction necessary to do the quest.  So if someone didn't, the MQ qon't work (except that someone else could hand in the item the person with insufficient faction did, and get the item).



<p><b><a name="mq11">Q: Can I complete the epic prior to being level 50?</a></b>

<p>A: Yes, it has been done, though the effect is not usable until level 50.



<p><b><a name="mq12">Q: What are the 'ancient thin flute' and 'mechanical Iksar tail' for?</a></b>

<p>A: From <a href="http://www.geocities.com/kurrleeeci/ShackleGuideText.html" target=new>Kurrlee's quest guide</a>: 

<p>Ancient thin flute: once given to brother balatin in the dreadlands, he will despawn and then respawn in a version that needs to be killed.

<p>The mechanical Iksar tail is used in the "Peace of Mind" part of the shackle of tynnonium. It is need if you have been gave a faded white tome by the librarian of kaesora.



<p><b><a name="mq13">Q: How do i get the shackle of scale?</a></b>

<p>A: There is no shackle by that name currently in EQ.



<p><b><a name="mq14">Q: What is beyond the Shackle of Steel?</a></b>

<p>A: There is the Shackle of Tynnonium, and then the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Kurrleeeci/ShackleGuideText.html" target=new>Whistling Fists</a>.<p>


<p><h3><a name="monkeq">Monk Equipment</a></h3>
<p><b><a name="me1"></a>Q: How does haste stacking work?</b>

<p>A: There are 5 types of haste for purposes of stacking:

<p>1. Item Haste - e.g. that gained from wearing an item with the 'haste' effect on it. Such items include FBSS, Runed Bolster Belt, Cloak of Flames.

<p>2. Spell/Song Haste - e.g. that gained from either having a haste spell cast on you, or a bard song playing. This category includes the effect on the Robe of the Whistling Fists and the Celestial Fists and also the clickable effect on the Eyepatch of Plunder.

<p>3. Ervaj songs - There are 2 bard songs (a 5% one at 50, and a 10% one at 60) which stack on top of item and other spell/song haste but cannot go over the haste cap

<p>4. Vah Shir songs - Stack with item and all other song hastes and allow group members to go over the haste cap. 

<p>5. Monk Discipline - 100 fist - stacks with everything



<p>There are Haste Caps (for monks)of:



<p>85% (< lev 51)

<p>100% (51 - 60)



<p>Some examples:



<p>Some combos (with haste granted to clarify) assumed level 51+ for purpose of capping.



<p>1) FBSS (21%) + RoTWF (25%) = 46%

<p>2) FBSS (21%) + Epic (40%) = 61%

<p>3) FBSS (21%) + Speed of the Shissar (66%) = 87%

<p>4) FBSS (21%) + Shissar (66%) + Epic (40%) = 87%

<p>(note epic haste does not stack with shissar haste, however the

<p>ATK/AC boost elements do stack)

<p>5) Golden Sash of Tranquility (41%) + Shissar (66%) = 100% (haste is capped at a maximum of 100)

<p>6) SoTD (24%) + Shissar (66%) + Composition of Ervaj (10%) =100%, since Ervaj doesn't bring you over the cap.



<p>There are only 2 ways to exceed the haste cap of 100%:

<p>1) High level bard songs (e.g. Warsong of the Vah Shir - 25% haste) will stack with other spell hastes to take you to 125% 

<p>2) 100 fist discipline ignores the haste cap and stacks with all other hastes in the game. Supposed 20%.



<p>Max Haste Solo:

<p>41% haste item + 40% from epic= 81% (+ 20% from 100 fists if disc active)



<p>Max Haste Grouped:

<p>41% haste item + Chanter/Bard Song Haste > 59% (eg. Shissar) + Warsong of the Vah Shir (25% stackable)= 125% (+ 20% from 100 fists if disc active).



<p><b><a name="me2"></a>Q: Do Holgresh Elder Beads still drop?</b>

<p>A: No, they don't. Not that there's as much use for them nowadays, since they've been nerfed not to get aggro at all.  That said, there's a drop from the stone spider in SolB that has 5 charges of Eye of Zomm, as well as a tinkered piece called Stalking Probes that takes 106 tinkering skill to trivial and costs 16pp in components.  Make friends with a gnome today!



<p><b><a name="me3"></a>Q: Which of these two weapons is better?</b>

<p>A: We can't answer this question unless you give us the complete stats of the weapons, as well as your level and the environment you intend to use the weapon in (i.e. XP grinding, raiding, etc). Even then, there are good <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/equipment.asp" target=new>guides and spreadsheets</a> you can use to do this comparison yourself.



<p><b><a name="me4"></a>Q: I just got this AE proc weapon -- how do I use this thing?</b>

<p>A: <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=126.topic" target=new>Cuthul Paindancer's guide to the Adamantite Bo Stick</a> will tell you all about your new toy.



<p><b><a name="me5"></a>Q: Has the drop rate on the fungi tunic been nerfed?</b>

<p>A: By anecdotal evidence, yes it has. It does still drop though.



<p><b><a name="me6"></a>Q: Is there going to be a change/nerf on the fungi tunic preventing monk use or changing the effect?</b>

<p>A: No. It's been the same effect and usable by the same races/classes since day one. There is absolutely no reason they would/should alter it in any way shape or form.



<p><b><a name="me7"></a>Q: What is better? Fungi Tunic or PSC?</b>

<p>A: Depends on what you plan to do and how much weight you can afford to wear.



<p><b><a name="me8"></a>Q: What's pumice, and where can I get some?</b>

<p>A: Crystallized Pumice is a 0.8wt, non-stackable, merchant-bought item that has 5 charges of Nullify Magic (a spell that removes the top 2 buffs an enemy has, for a 2.0second casting time). It's an invaluable tool for soloing, since you can pumice away SoW and damage shields on enemies and DoTs on yourself. It costs about 12pp, and is sold at any herb vendor (Ask your local alchemist. they'll know where the herb vendors are.)



<p><b><a name="me9"></a>Q: I attacked a Wisp and a Ghoul and every attack said "You punch a Ghoul but it is INVULNERABLE" why can't I do damage to these monsters?</b>

<p>A: Wisps, Ghouls and some other creatures require magic weapons to hit and do damage to them. At level 30 your fists become magical weapons, but until then you will need to obtain magical gloves to fight these creatures. Some gloves available are Wu's Fighting Guantlets(Tailor Created), Mesh Gloves(Frogloks in Guk and Qeynos Sewers), Treant Fists(Quest) All special attacks (except Kick) are magical too. However, the "kick" at the end of Instill Doubt is not -- so you need magic shoes to be able to successfully ID magic-damage-only monsters.



<p><b><a name="me10"></a>Q: My bag just became NO DROP! What gives?!?</b>

<p>A: You have a NO DROP item in the bag. Take it out, and your bag will be all better.



<p><b><a name="me11"></a>Q: What's the difference in AC between humans and Iksar?</b>

<p>A: The difference is about 40AC at level 60; a rough formula you can use is that at level X, the difference in AC between equally-equipped, equally-statted Human and Iksar monks is X AC. Of course, the difference decreases as you go up in level.



<p><b><a name="me12"></a>Q: I just started fighting in Velious. What faction should I follow?</b>

<p>A: Several lines of thought here. A)Follow the faction that your guild is on. B)Depends on how well equipped you are and who you group with. C)Depends on what quest armor you want 



<p><b><a name="me13"></a>Q: What Velious Quest armor should I shoot for?</b>

<p>A: Depends on who you group with. Thurgadin is the easiest to do but also the one with the crappiest stats. Kael is pretty much the best of the four but is the hardest to get. Skyshrine falls somewhere in the middle.  Plane of Growth armour has the same stats as Thurgadin armour.



<p><b><a name="me14"></a>Q: How do I make the Thurgadin gate potion?</b>

<p>A: Follow this <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=94" target=new>guide</a>.



<p><b><a name="me15"></a>Q: Where can I find a good damage calculator/log parser/weapon comparer?</b>

<p>A: There are a number of great log parsers -- MEqA, EQMonk, EQRaider, even Copeland's will work for you.
