As you know  there are 2 version of SWG coming to retail stores, the normal box and the premium box..Haden just released the details of what is going to be in the premium box:
</p>
<ul>
<i>
<p>
The Special Edition includes the full version of the game along with the following collection of exclusive items:
</p>
<p>
*Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided Concept Art Book. This includes nearly every piece of concept art ever done for the game, including a great deal of never-before-seen stuff (even a few pieces that were "rejected" for continuity reasons), preliminary sketches for the CGW cover, an intro by our Lead Artist Jake Rodgers, some cool continuity/game info, final model shots and screenshots, and comparisons to film stills. This book has been a labor of love for some of us, and I think it's going to be an excellent look at one aspect of the game's development.
</p>
<p>
*Collectible pewter figurine featuring a Zabrak female with a blaster rifle. This is one of the most detailed SW figures I've ever seen. It's based on an in-game character and in-game wearables.
</p>
<p>
*Sew-on patch featuring the logo for Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. We hope to do patches for each installment of the game.
</p>
<p>
*Lapel pin featuring both Imperial and Rebel insignias as well as Star Wars Galaxies logo.
</p>
<p>
*Spiral-bound manual, with a cover autographed by all the Leads on the Galaxies team, and a special surprise.
</p>
<p>
It all comes packaged in a pretty solid black box with the Star Wars Galaxies logo embossed on the cover and sides (I just saw the box today and it could hold all your old Star Wars RPG sourcebooks...). 
</ul>
</i>
</p>
<p>
I don't know about you, but, i'll be getting the basic box-even with all that, i cannot justify the expense to the wife

I know that many of you have been waiting patiently for the results of our meetings last week. Well, here is our official statement, which will also be posted at LucasArts.com and elsewhere. There are a few more comments at the very end... 
</p>
<p>
Begin "official" message...
</p>
<p>
"Star Wars Galaxies is now entering the final phase of development, and everyone at LucasArts and Sony Online Entertainment is pleased with the game's progress since the beta test program was initiated. We've received a good deal of constructive feedback and many positive suggestions that, if executed, will genuinely enhance gameplay for the hundreds of thousands of players who comprise the community. 
</p>
<p>
To deliver the best possible massively multiplayer experience and ensure stability and breadth of content, LucasArts and Sony Online Entertainment will delay the game's April 15 launch. This will enable us to invest more time into the beta program, and to solicit additional feedback from the tremendous fan base Star Wars Galaxies has already developed.
</p>
<p>
"In addition, we will not open phase three of the beta program until we feel the game is ready for a wider audience, which we anticipate will be within the next few weeks. A new release date for Star Wars Galaxies will be announced shortly after the beginning of beta three.
</p>
<p>
"We are sincerely grateful to the Star Wars Galaxies community for their tremendous support. We respectfully ask for their continued understanding and patience during these final few months leading up to the launch of what we believe will be one of the best MMOs to date."
</p>
<p>
End official statement...
</p>
<p>
That last paragraph is especially important. We *are* extremely grateful for all your support and the tremendous goodwill we've enjoyed over the past many months. I know that this news is going to be disappointing for some of you, and I can only hope that you'll continue to be patient and supportive of our efforts. For our part, we will continue to work very hard to keep the fantastic relationship we've built with the community intact. We will strive to keep you informed and update you more quickly when changes like this occur.
</p>
<p>
Thank you again, for everything you do to make this what I believe is the best MMO community to date.

Application consideration for the Beta I pool is now closed. Beta I participants have been selected and will be informed today (Thursday, March 13, 2003). If you were selected for the Beta I pool but not for participation in Beta I, please be patient as you will automatically be in the Beta II pool. While this does not guarantee you will be selected for participation in Beta II, it does increase your chances above those who will not be invited to the Beta II pool. If you were not selected for inclusion in the Beta I pool you will automatically be considered for inclusion in the other Beta phases. If you have not yet signed up for Beta consideration, now would be a good time.
