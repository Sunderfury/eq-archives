      iniatited by visiting Master Paub in the Ashen Order house in Freeport.
      The link between Treant Fists and Master Paub comes from Grim Oakfist, the
      originator of the Collar of Nekisha quest. When that quest is finished, he
      says that he gave his last pair of Treant Fists to Master Paub.</FONT></P>

         Clawfist is a Kerran, a catman. He braved the dangers of Norrath to

      Bone. The items are all found around the Runnyeye zone, 2 within Runnyeye
      itself, one in Misty Thicket, and one in the Gorge. You do not need to
      visit the banished Kerran first to get the box, just collect the items
      first, saving you the extra trip. The text is found below.</FONT></P>

        exact same spot as the rightmost of the two, nearest to the fork. The
        normal goblin spawn on a six minute timer, but the placeholder spawns in
        between the six-minute spawn, and is a 72-min spawn. The Placeholders
