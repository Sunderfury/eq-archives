      The Lheao section was not very clear. He said something along the lines of
      &quot;I need proof you are from Dahl and proof of your mastery.&quot; but
      only AFTER you have already given him the note. Telling Lheao that you
      have the book 'Immortals.' did not trigger him like it should. The proof
      of Mastery, after a leap of faith from both Derra and Bloodscale, was
      found to be the RotWF. Kaiaren also says one more line than he used to. A
      patch added the information we have now.</FONT></P>

      Kaiarens true form was bugged, and turning in the scale from Eejag
      resulted in xp and the return of the scale. This was able to be done
      multiple times, and was rumored to have very quickly leveled a Monk from
      40 to 60 in this manner. The following are patch messages from the time
      before the quest was finished.</FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Due to some
      difficulties regarding the Epic Quests implemented two patches ago, the

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">This was also added in a EQ Forum:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B><FONT FACE="Verdana">I verified that the Celestial
      Fist of Earth is spawning on live servers and made sure that part of the
      quest works. He is and it does. Kaiaren as you all know has been
      permakilled on live servers due to the Charred Scale exploit, something I
      should have caught in development and testing should have caught in
      testing and I apologize for it. He will be back up and fixed after the
      next patch. </FONT></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B><FONT FACE="Verdana">Thanks, Solist </FONT></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">It was (not long) later found that the
      Earth fist (a sleeping Ogre/Trunt) was indeed in the game, as at this
      time, Monks did not believe he was.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><U><B>November:</B></U> The Quest was
      completed on Test, due to the fact that Kaiaren was not (and is still not
      as of early November) back in the game on the live servers. The Haste is
      Item Haste, and the Robe was not returned, so effectively making most
      Monks able to do the quest, at a loss Haste wise. Those lucky enough to
      have CoF or Belt of Tranquility where already at 36% to 40% Haste, and
      that did not include the 25% Haste of the Robe. Even those with a FBSS
      (21%) and the robe where at 46% Haste total. Now they have increased the
      item haste to 40%, but lost the robes effects. This is not of consequence
      to some, but the Robe was one of our best Chest pieces, and makes the
      quest seem not too viable in some peoples eyes.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Wakefield, the Monk with the CF's was
      asked to do some feedback relating to the CF's, and sent a diplomatic
      email explaining that the Str and Haste where not really on par with an
      epic weapon, which is more or less what I have said above. He mentioned
      Att bonuses rather than Str, and perhaps better haste. He then received
      this email as a reply from Soloist, the Quest writer:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Thanks for the feedback. There are
      indeed some problems due to code changes that were made regarding the
      Celestial Fists and they are not currently working as I intended. I won't
      give you the details on exactly what they are supposed to do but we will
      have them fixed and working properly before our next patch. I just want to
      assure everyone in the monk community that they won't be going live the
      way they are, and that nothing on Test is guaranteed to be the same on
      live. </FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Wakefield then replied with this post a
      few days later: </FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">&quot;I hate to say this, but yeah the
      fists have been changed... and no I cant tell you how =P. Solist asked me
      for feedback again and asked if I could keep it secret. Haha, I feel like
      a dick but I will be keeping this new change secret. Best I can say is....

    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B>&quot;They will increase damage and he
      asked for some fast feedback before it goes live. I noticed 2 potential
      problems with the new change and 1 is easily resolvable by us. Emailed him
      again with some more points only a experienced monk user could give and a
      coder wouldnt think of, I think its gonna work out. Soon as this is live
      and yall do the quest I'll join ya all in philosophizing, hehe.&quot;</B></FONT>

      the HtH of those who wielded them.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B><U>June 2001:</U></B> A patch has

      overwrite Celestial Tranquility, and we would lose the additional 40
      attack and 12 AC from the effect. Now the haste is the only part
      overwritten, and we keep the att and AC.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC"><B><U>August 2001:</U></B> Another patch
