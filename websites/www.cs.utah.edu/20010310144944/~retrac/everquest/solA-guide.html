      It's been called a monk's paradise, and for good reason.&nbsp; I spent
      much of levels 30-40 down amongst the goblin and gnome denizens of this
      dungeon, picking up fast experience and enough cash to buy two Tink Bags,
      a FBSS, and other equipment upgrades.&nbsp; How can you not love a dungeon
      with amazing loot plus not one but TWO merchants (including one, the
      goblin merchant, who sells bandages and water - no food)?&nbsp; I learned
      a lot about how to handle this dungeon from fellow monks, mostly at <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com"><font color="#FFFF00">Monkly
      Business</font></a>, and this guide is my attempt to give something back
      to the community.&nbsp; The guide is written assuming you know how to use
      feign, flop past MOBs, and feign off casters.<br>
      <br>
      Let's start with a map of the entire dungeon.&nbsp; This map is an
      annotated version of the one available at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com"><font color="#FFFF00">EQAtlas</font></a>,
      the best EQ map website out there (in my opinion).&nbsp; On the map, I
      have added indications of where many of the static and wandering spawns
      are located.&nbsp; Pay special attention to the wanderers' paths: some of
      the best loot in Sol A drops from uncommon wandering spawns (Singe,
      Kindle, and the CWG Model EXG).&nbsp; Understanding the wanderers' pathing
      is also important for handling the barroom effectively.&nbsp; <font color="#FFFF00"><b><br>

      <font face="Arial">Note that the only goblin above level 32 is the Goblin
      Captain, so you can safely assume that a successful feign will mem wipe
      any goblins that you have pissed off.&nbsp; The same cannot be said for
      the gnomes and clockworks, so be careful -- this may be the first time you
      have experienced a MOB rushing back to you as soon as you stand up, even
      if they are well outside of aggro range!<br>
      <br>
      Speaking of aggro ranges, none of the MOBs in Sol A have particularly
      large aggro ranges, or at least they did not for me (level 30+).&nbsp;
      This fact, combined with the fact that both the goblins and
      gnomes/clockworks are social creatures, makes it relatively easy to pull
      and fight MOBs to locations where <font color="#FFFF00">they will not run</font>.&nbsp;
      You read that right -- you can survive in Sol A as a monk, despite not
      having snare, which is normally considered a must-have for dungeon
      crawls.&nbsp; I point out locations where I like to pull MOBs that have
      this &quot;free root&quot; effect in my discussions below.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial">Finally, as a monk, you should get used to timing
      respawns.&nbsp; When I was hunting in Sol A, the respawn time was 19
      minutes, but I've read that it changes depending on how many people are in
      the dungeon.&nbsp; Time it yourself, and use this information to plan your
      hunting!&nbsp; In the long run, when you're pulling Karnor's Castle, say,
      getting into the habit of timing respawns and adjusting your pulls
      accordingly is the difference between life and death, so start getting
      into the habit now.<br>

      <font face="Arial">Most of the above is best sold to
      other players.&nbsp; In addition, the goblins and gnomes both drop lots of fine steel,
      bricks of ore, and gems.&nbsp; With two merchants in the zone (use Sneak
      to sell to them), you can easily walk away with over 100pp after an
      evening of fighting, even if you get none of the special loot listed
      above!&nbsp; The clockworks also drop Melatite, which rangers and paladins
      need for making their mid-level class armor.&nbsp; Be nice and give it
      away, or sell it for 10+pp per brick.&nbsp; A number of NODROP quest items
      also drop: fire goblin skin (used for Magicians' Cloak of the Elements
      quest), Fiery Vambraces and Firewalker Boots (used for Bards' Lambent
      armor quests), Goblin Fire Totem (used for Crafted Helm quest), Inferno
      Goblin Wizard Heart (used for both a Ranger and Wizard quest), and the

            hangout of monks.&nbsp; The good news is that static MOBs in the
            area do not aggro on you if you are behind the bar.&nbsp; However,
            the two wandering goblins <i>will</i> aggro if you are fighting
            behind the bar!&nbsp; The goblins in this area can be fire or
            inferno goblins (levels 24-28), and can be warriors, shaman, or
            wizards.&nbsp; You need to adapt your strategy depending on whether
            there are any shaman in the area and what kinds of MOBs are
            wandering.&nbsp; The drunkard is a mage (read: nasty fire shield)
            with mediocre loot, so I ignored it.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFF00">Basic strategy</font>:
            Tag the bartender (or placeholder) and fight in the corner marked on
            the map.&nbsp; If he gets up on the bar, back away until it jumps
            down, or you risk aggroing the patrons.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFF00">Handling nearby shaman</font>:
            Shaman heal their nearby friends, even if they won't join the
            fight.&nbsp; If the shaman is in an adjoining room, just fight in
            the opposite corner.&nbsp; If, however, the shaman is a bar patron,
            you will need to kill it first.&nbsp; Do so by aggroing both
            patrons, pulling to the marked spot, and feign splitting.&nbsp;
            Repeat until you get only the shaman and kill it.&nbsp; Then go back
            to killing the bartender.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFF00">Handling wanderers</font>:
            If a wanderer passes the door of the bar while you are fighting, it
            will aggro.&nbsp; The wanderer that paths down by the goblin
            merchant only comes by every few minutes, so if you time it you can
            ignore it.&nbsp; However, the one that paths to either side of the
            bar area passes by often, so it interferes a lot.&nbsp; If it is a
            warrior, you can just feign when it aggros and resume fighting when
            it wanders off (several times per fight).&nbsp; If it is a shaman or
            (worse) wizard, you need to kill it first (unless are high enough
            level that you do not care about adds).&nbsp; This is tricky, given
            the tight spacing of MOBs in the area.&nbsp; Since the aggro ranges
            are level dependent, I'll let you devise your own strategy for
            taking them out (experiment).</font></td>

            backdoor to Sol B, and you are out of range of the high shaman's
            healing.&nbsp; Single pull the wanderer and two goblins in the outer
            rooms.&nbsp; This leaves three MOBs: a Solusek of some kind, Lynada,
            and the high shaman (or placeholders).&nbsp; If Lynada is up, sit in
            the outer room and listen for her casting damage shields: they last <font color="#FFFF00">five
            minutes</font>.&nbsp; I broke the room by hitting her pet, running,
            and feigning.&nbsp; The pet will path back to the <font color="#FFFF00">outer</font>
            room, while the others will return to the room indicated.&nbsp;
            Then, when I timed it so that I knew Lynada's shield was down, I hit
            the pet with a shuriken and ran to the marked spot.&nbsp; At 40th
            level, only Lynada came.&nbsp; She was easy to take down without her
            shield and with my MR gear on (MR of 67).&nbsp; Then it was just a
            matter of feign pulling the other two, and killing the respawns
            until I got my ring.&nbsp; If you bring lots of pumice, you do not

      working their way up through the gnomes and clockworks (the only spawns
      that give XP by the upper 30s).&nbsp; It's also great fun.&nbsp; I hope
