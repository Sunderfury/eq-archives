      'Brother Balatin', who is a skeletal Monk on the pyramid in the giant
      wizard spires within the Dreadlands in Kunark. The giant spires are
      located at the far end of the zone, where the Druid rings are. </FONT></P>

          Enchanter (or a Necro as Balatin is undead), as a Bards Charm is pulse
          based, and breaks and recharms every 9 secs or so. Balatin breaks
          charm sometimes quicker than a normal NPC would, so it is best to be

         Brother Balatin turns to you. A transparent human face materalizes upon
        the skull. As he speaks the smell of rotted rat corpses rushes into your

         Brother Balatin says 'Then we are one. The rebirth of our circle shall
        start with you. I have waited decades for your arrival. You should seek
        the living brothers within Tunaria. When you have earned your garb then
        you will be ready for the true drape.<BR>

         Brother Balatin says 'Seek the broken flute of our master. Taken from

      </B>The quest is possible to be done via 'multi questing', ie it will work
      if you use two other people to turn the pipes in. Last confirmed date was
      7th May 2001.<BR>
       <BR> Firstly, charm Brother Balatin, hail him, and go through all the text (or
      not --depending on your mood), then have helper A turn in (as in complete
      the trade by clicking the trade button) their pipe, and wait to get the &quot;May
      you have the correct items or lost forever will be all&quot; message. <BR><BR>
       Have helper B turn in the other pipe, again wait to get the &quot;May you
      have the correct items or lost forever will be all&quot; message. </FONT></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000">Then turn in
      your robe. Please make sure you hand in the correct items, there is not a
      really short time limit before the trade needs to be completed. One
      brother I know accidently handed in his TStaff, (luckily before the robe
      was handed in) but got it back by killing Balatin. Also, it is reported to
      still be ok if the charm breaks while you are handing in items. Just
      recharm him and continue as if nothing happened. The person that this
      happened to still got their robe. </FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" COLOR="#000000"><B>Note:
      After EVERY piece that is handed in by a seperate person, you will get the
      &quot;May you...&quot; message. I recently multi'd this quest with two
      others, and lost my robe as the first person mistakenly gave in a weapon
      instead of the pipe. Please DOUBLE CHECK the items you hand in, or just
      take that extra second to notice whether Balatin is now weilding a weapon
      that he previously did not have. I did not, and lost my RotLC......</B></FONT></P>

        of the pieces of the steel flute is found on the Iksar Betrayer within
        Chardok. He is approx a 53rd Monk Mob, and can be taken down by a good
        group of 50+'s. He is a rare spawn, but not in Rasters league.<BR>
         <BR>
         The Betrayer is found in the tunnel area, not far from the zone out.
        The tunnel is 15' above the ground, so levitate or some other means is
        required to access it. The tunnel contains at least 3 wanderers, any of
        which can be the Betrayer.<BR>
         <BR>
         It is highly recommended for the group to be level 52+, and contain a
        Enchanter/Bard for crowd control. The Mobs here hit very hard, and
        </FONT><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">spread aggro easily to one another,
        resulting in often add ons. <BR>
         <BR>
         Pulling to the zone out is an option, but the puller will get severly
        beaten in the run back, but if you do pull to the zone out, you will
        have the luxury of zoning to remove excess aggro rather than /quit ing
        out. There are alot of caster Mobs here, some Mobs will Gate, and others
        move at SoW speed. <BR>
         <BR>
         It is roughly a 26 min spawn in Chardok. </FONT></FONT></TD>
