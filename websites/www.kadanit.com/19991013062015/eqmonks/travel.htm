<p align="center"><font color="#FF8000">Misty Thicket</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Probably the best newbie zone in the game. Great exp and loot,
very safe. To get to misty thicket from Freeport, go to east commonlands, zone east to
west commonlands, zone east again, then zone north to RiverVale. And exit RevirVale
through the other exit into Misty Thicket. You will probably want to go to misty thicket
at level 5-6. be sure to bind yourself to RiverVale.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Misty Thicket is split in half by a giant Wall. If you follow the
road that comes out of RiverVale, you will get to the gate of the wall (that wall is good
for practicing safe fall). Before the Wall you will find Bats, Snakes, wolfs and
FireBeetles mostly. But beyond the wall is the interesting part. There are Shadow wolfs
(Level 4-6), Goblin Warriors (Level 5-7), Giant spiders (Level 7-8, weak poison), Giant
Wasps (Level 8-10), Giant Scarabs (Level 9-11) and Young Kodiaks (Level 9-11) running
around. There are also three Goblin camps. If you stick to your left as you go passed the
wall you will run into them all one by one. There are about three Goblin Warriors (Level
5-7) in each camp which spawn quite quickly as well as a Goblin Shaman named Mooto (Level
9-11). Mooto is pretty weak for his level, his spells are very weak but he hits pretty
hard (as much as 22). However he doesn't hit very often (because he is busy casting his
weak spells) and he has very low hps for his level. Mooto is usually at the first Goblin
camp, but runs around between them. If you stick to your right past the wall, you will see
an Orc camp. There are only two orcs in it which spawn more slowly then the goblins in
their camps. They are usually centurion orcs (Level 9-11) with the exception of Orc
oracles (Level 9-11 spell casters, about as strong as Mooto) and Orc Legionnaires (Level
11-14). If you go to your right and a bit forward passed the wall up on the hill. There is
a spawning ground for two undead. During the day they will be Skeletons (Level 5-7) or
Decaying skeletons (Level 1). During the night, 1 zombie (Level 7-9) or a lesser mummy
(Level 9-11, casts rabies, you will need a Cleric to cure you disease after the fight)
will spawn. The spawn rate of the undead is about five minutes.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF8000">Innothule Swamp and Guk</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">When you reach the Innothule Swamp, first of all, congratulate
yourself. It's a tough trip.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">You should stick to your left until you reach a hole in the
mountain, that is the entrance to Upper Guk. There are two Froglok guards inside the
mountain, guarding the entrance to Upper Guk. They are only level 7 or so.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">If you're looking for Netted armor, kill Froglok tads (level 1)
and regular Frogloks (level 3-5) near the entrance to Guk. If you run into a Troll Slayer,
run - zone into Guk. You can try to kill the Troll slayer, but you should be at least
level 20, and he will run from you and swim very fast... If you're looking for Woven
Armor, it's better to get it in Guk, then on Froglok Fisherman (level 6-7) in the Swamp.
When you Enter Guk you will see two low Level Frogloks. As you go in further you will run
into some level 8-9 Frogloks which sometimes carry Woven Armor and finally a Bridge.
Unless you're level 20+ or level 17+ with a full group, don't cross the bridge. Beyond the
Bridge are level 17+ mobs including Froglok Gaz Warriors, which carry the wonderful Mesh
Armor.</font> You should group if you want to cross the bridge, with someone who can Root.
Frogloks run pretty fast and you can't chase them because you will run into some real
nasty mobs in Guk.
