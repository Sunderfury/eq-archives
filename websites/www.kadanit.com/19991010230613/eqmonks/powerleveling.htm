<p><font color="#0000FF">Up to level 10</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">When powerleveling, you should wear the best armor available
(obviously), without going over 14 pounds. What does that mean? Get yourself some food and
water, and a lightsource. And a set of cloth armor. Now replace some of the cloth armor
with Leather armor until your weight is 14. Now you're at max efficiency for your level.
When hunting don't loot anything that will make you go over 15 pounds. You wont make much
money, but you will level up faster. Also, at level 10, it's best to fight mobs that /con
blue rather then mobs that /con black/white. The best place to hunt at level 10 is Misty
Thicket, you can find information on how to get there in the <a href="travel.htm">Popular
zones section</a>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">If you see a High level Shaman, Cleric or Druid in your zone
(14+), ask him to buff you, most will agree. You will be suprised how much these buffs
help. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Levels 13-15</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Kill shivered mummies in North Ro, you should group with a Cleric
(because those shivered mummies will give you rabies and Clerics kick ass against undead),
preferably one that is lower then you in level. Shivered mummies respawn very fast in
North Ro, and are pretty easy for their level.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Effective grouping</font></p>

<p>A Monk's best friend is a Shaman. A level 20 Monk and Shaman can take on mobs that /con
yellow. Why is that? well, Shamans have awesome buffs. They can buff your Dexterity,
Agility, Strength, Stamina, AC and hps. You will be much more effective this way. You will
hit for more, get hit less and miss less often. Also, with the added buffs, you will get
hit very little, so even though Warriors have more hps then you do, you will last much
longer And the Shaman can heal you while you are fighting.</p>
