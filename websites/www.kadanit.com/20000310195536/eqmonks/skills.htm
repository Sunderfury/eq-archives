        skill allows you to bandage yourself (if you have bandages) and heal yourself up to 50% of
        your health. Each bandage takes about 10 seconds to use and with a high Bind wound skill
        it will heal about 20 hp. At low levels, you wont be able to afford enough bandages to
        make good use of this skill (a bandage costs about 6 silver). But at high levels bind
        wound is a nice hobby for Monks, though it wont add much to your character... just
        slightly reduce downtime. It can however save your life if you are seriously poisoned and
        losing hp while sitting. In that case it's good to have a few bandages and a high bind
        wound skill.</td>

        will not take any damage from a blow that will otherwise hurt you. Although you get this
        skill at level 1, it will not improve unless you put one point into it at your guild.</td>

        <td width="100%"><font color="#ff8000">Dual wield</font> - If this skill is successful,
        you will strike with your other hand as well. To give an example of how this skill works,
        at level 10 you should strike twice per round about 10% of the time. At level 14 you
        should strike twice per round at least 30% of the time. When your duel wield is 150, you
        will start getting two attacks on a regular basis, this is also true for Double attack.
        One thing that many newbies don't know is that if you carry something in your other hand
        (a light source for example), duel wield will not work, it will not improve and you wont
        strike twice. Not only your skill level in duel wield effects your success rate, your
        Dexterity has a huge influence on whether or not you duel wield and also the opponent you
        are attacking - You will duel wield more often against an opponent with a low AC.</td>

        get. If successful, this skill will heal 25% of your maximum health at the moment. It
        recycles every 6 minutes. At low levels this skill will fail often and sometimes even
        worsen your wounds! So it's best not to use it during battle unless you're going to die
        anyway. When your skill reaches 100 (at level 20), it will never fail again.</td>

        <td width="100%"><font color="#ff8000">Throwing</font> - This skill allows you to throw
        items at other creatures dealing a small amount of damage (usually). The only use this
        skill has for a Monk is to fetch monsters. At low levels, you can also finish off running
        mobs with this skill, however throwing daggers are quite expensive for low level Monks.
        You can not retrieve a thrown item, after you throw it - it's forever gone.</td>

    of 50. It recycles at the same speed Kick does, every three rounds or so.</td>

    Oh, you will also make no sound while moving. So you can sneak behind monsters without
    them knowing you are there and charging you, they will only attack you if they can see
    you. This skill is useful for getting the first hit in combat against aggressive monsters
    (you just sneak behind them and attack). It's very hard to use this skill to cross zones
    safely, I much rather run. It's also very useful in PvP.&nbsp; Another use of Sneak is to
    go behind an NPC that you have bad faction with and sneak, then you can buy from it and
    sell to it.</td>

    basically the same, if successful, you will not take damage from a blow that will
    otherwise hurt you (same as dodge, but not an upgrade to dodge, works in addition).
    However there is a small difference between the two skills, Block tends to work more
    often, so it's better. You cannot Block blows from creatures that are behind you.</td>

    color="#ff8000">Double attack</font> - If this skill is successful, you will strike twice
    per round. Combined with dual wield, you can get four attack per round, however that is
    very rare. When you max double attack and duel wield (at around level 16) you will get 2.5
    attack on average. When you get to level 20-25, your average will increase to 3. From
    level 25 you will not see a significant difference in the number of attack per round,
    although nearing level 50 you should be getting 4 attacks per round on a regular basis.
    Not only your skill level in double attack effects your success rate, your Dexterity has a
    huge influence on whether or not you double attack and also the opponent you are attacking
    - You will double attack more often against an opponent with a low AC.</td>

    that means you FAILED! You will be successful more often if you stop attacking the monster
    for a few seconds before trying to Feign death. If you're low on health and have your back

        fighting will drop the weapon it is using. You can't disarm magical weapons. Against mobs,
        this skill is sometimes useful. The way mobs use weapons is, they only use the damage or
        delay of the weapon if it's better than what they have naturally. Since you only get this
        skill at level 27, you will never fight mobs that have a lower damage base than the weapon
        they are using. But if you're fighting a mob that's holding a fine steel dagger, it will
        hit with a 19 delay for the same damage. In PvP this skill is skill is somewhat useful. As
        things are today, disarming someone in PvP will send their weapon to their inventory
        rather than drop it on the ground (if it's magical, which is always the case after level
        27). </td>

        Will usually go off two-three times in a battle so it wont make a big difference. But if
