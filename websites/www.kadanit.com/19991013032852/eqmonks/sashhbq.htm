<p>In the Freeport and Qeynos guilds, you can get quests for Sashes or Headbands. </p>

<p>Both the Sashes and the Headbands give the same bonuses.</p>

<p>White&nbsp; +1 Stamina +1 Charisma</p>

<p>Yellow +1 Stamina +1 Charisma +1 Agility +1 HP</p>

<p>Orange +2 Stamina +1 Charisma +1 Agility +2 HP</p>

<p>Red&nbsp; +1 Dexterity +2 Stamina +2 Charisma +2 Agility +2 HP</p>

<p>Purple +1 Dexterity +2 Stamina +2 Charisma +2 Agility +3 HP +1 AC</p>

<p>Blue: +1ac, +1str, +2dex, +3sta, +3cha, +2agi, +3hp (Not in the game yet, you can get
it by killing the Monk guild master that is suposed to give out the quest).<br>
<br>
Black: +2ac, +2str, +3dex, +4sta, +4cha, +1int, +3agi, +4hp (Not in the game yet, you can
get it by killing the Monk guild master that is suposed to give out the quest).<br>
<br>
<br>
They each Weigh 0.2 pounds.</p>

<p>If your faction is high enough, you can get the sash quests from the Freeport guild and
the qeynos headband quests as well. If you go from Freeport to Qeynos for example, you can
kill Gnolls for faction. However you can get your faction up instantly, by getting a guild
note from another Monk that started in Qeynos (you can just create one, drop in on the
ground and pick it up with your Freeport Monk). After you give the note to the Qeynos
guildmaster, your faction will go up enough and you could get the Headband quests as well
without having to kill hundreds of Gnolls.</p>
