<p>As a Monk, no matter what your Strength is, if you carry 15 pounds or more -&nbsp; you
will start losing AC. Not only do you lose AC, you also hit, dodge, block, riposte, duel
wield and double attack less often. At low levels, the AC loss isn't as significant as it
is in higher levels. But either way, it's not good to weigh more then 14 pounds.</p>

<p>So if you are out hunting for EXP, you would want to leave town weighing 14 with only
armor, food, water and maybe a lightsource. And not loot anything that will make you weigh
15 pounds. Basically that means you will loot only coins, and not alot of them. In case
you didn't know, coins weigh too. 40 coins or so weigh 1 pound. So lose that copper! At my
level I don't even loot gold usually, just plat. When you get to town, visit the bank and
convert all your coins, so you will have as little as possible. Depositing some is also
not a bad idea.</p>

<p>Some people don't know this, but When you stack items, such as food, water or bandages,
they weigh the same as a single item would. So 20 food, 20 water and 20 bandages weigh the
same as 1 food, 1 water and 1 bandage.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF8000">Armor</font></p>

<p>Monks can wear up to leather, including some magical armor. A full suit of leather
weighs way too much for a Monk. Although it will give you more AC then a full suit of
cloth, it's not worth it. Let's see what type of Armor is good for Monks.</p>

<p>Cloth - A set of cloth weighs maybe 5 pounds and give like 40AC, I recommend getting a
full set of cloth as soon as you can afford it.</p>

<p>Leather - At low levels, you may want to mix some leather with your cloth for maximum
effectiveness. Just don't weigh more then 15 pounds.</p>

<p>Netted - This Magical armor can be found on Low level (1-5) Froglocks in the Innothule
Swamp. It is also found on Frogloks in the Qeynos swears. It gives the same AC as cloth,
but weighs a bit less. With netted gloves you can hit monsters that can be hit by Magical
attacks only.</p>

<p>Woven - This Magical armor is Found in the Innothule Swamp and Guk on mobs ranging from
level 6 to 12. This armor weighs as little as netted and has the same AC as patchwork.
(the tunic gives 6 AC compared to the 4 AC that cloth gives). With Woven gloves you can
hit monsters that can be hit by Magical attacks only.</p>

<p>Mesh - This Magical armor is found in Guk on 20+ level mobs starting with Froglok Gaz
Warriors (actually they are level 17-19). However Mesh is rarely found on Gaz Warriors,
Its most commonly found on the Ton type Frogloks, Vis, Shin, Tzu etc. Mesh armor is as
light as Netted and has the same AC as Leather. With Mesh gloves you can hit monsters that
can be hit by Magical attacks only. Mesh armor is not only better then leather because it
weighs less, but it also absorbs damage like chain! </p>

<p>Azure&nbsp; - Found in lower Guk on Minotaur Patricarchs.&nbsp; This armor is stronger
then platemail and very light. I'm not sure how many pieces of this armor are available, I
only know of Azure sleeves which are&nbsp; AC&nbsp; 12 and weight only .4</p>

<p>SnakeSkin - This armor is found in the dungeon Paw on Nobles (Level 14). It is a bit
stronger then leather and weighs the same as leather. It also gives magical bonuses. This
armor is not magical in nature, you wont be able to hit magic only mobs with it. This
armor is ok to mix with Mesh or Woven for maximum effectiveness. The Gloves give a Dex
bonus (but you wont want to use them because they don't let you hit magical monsters, but
when you reach level 30 your punches are magical naturally and you can use snakeskin
gloves and hit magical monsters), the mask gives resist magic and the Jerkin resist
poison.</p>

<p>Rubicite platemail - Monks used to be able to wear this armor, but they can't anymore.</p>

<p>Lupine Armor - This armor was actually too heavy for monks, but it's weight has been
reduced. The gauntlets weigh 1. It can be found on lycanthropes, and can also be made by
Karg Icebear, a rare spawn in EverFrost. Karg Icebear will make you lupine armor if you
bring him the right components (werewolf pelts or claws) and some money. Lupine armor has
the same AC as leather and gives magical bonuses. </p>

<p>Green Platemail - The strongest armor in the game. Most people thought it is a GM only
item, but Brad McQuiad said, after helping those guys kill Lady Vox that all the stuff he
had on were attainable by regular people and he was wearing Green Splinted platemail. It
is wearable by Monks, however, I'm not sure how much it weighs (<a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/greenplate.html">EQlizer</a> says the gloves weigh
5, but I'm told from a more reliable source that they weigh only .5). If you have any
information on this Armor please <a href="mailto:qqq@isdn.net.il">E-mail me</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF8000">Weapons</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Do not use them. Why? because first of all, a Monk's fists are
the best weapon in the game. (well maybe a fiery avenger is). But your fists are certainly
better then any Blunt weapon you may find. But even if you do have an awesome blunt weapon
that is actually better then your fists, there is another - more important reason not to
use it. Blunt weapons weigh a TON! Blunt weapons weigh on AVG like 8 and if you're going
to duel wield them, that's 16 pounds, more then you should carry with your armor, food
etc...</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">There are, however, rumeors of Monk special weapons. I have no
information on any of them. It was thought that Demon Claws are a Monk only weapon, when
it was seen on a GM. However it turns out it's just a 1H&nbsp;&nbsp; slashing weapon. If
you have any information on any Monk special weapons, please <a href="mailto:qqq@isdn.net.il">E-mail me</a>. </font></p>
