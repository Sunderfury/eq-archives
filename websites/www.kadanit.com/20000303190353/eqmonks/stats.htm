<p><font color="#FF8000">Strength</font> - Your Strength will not affect you at all at low
levels. Since you wont be doing more damage and you wont be able to carry more then 14
pounds without taking penalties. However starting level 20 or so you will start doing a
bit more damage then Monks with less Strength. </p>

<p><font color="#FF8000">Stamina</font> - Will increase your max hp depending on your
level and also let you jump up and down more before getting tired.</p>

<p><font color="#FF8000">Agility</font> - Your Agility affects your AC, 3 agility = 1 ac.
Getting AC items is a much more effective way to get AC than +agility items. For example a
serpentine bracer will give you 4 ac while a symbol of loyalty to vox will get you 12 ac.
Agility is also supposed to help with dodging.</p>

<p><font color="#FF8000">Dexterity</font> - Suppingly helps with hit % and
riposte/parry/duel wield/double attack. Hard to say.</p>
