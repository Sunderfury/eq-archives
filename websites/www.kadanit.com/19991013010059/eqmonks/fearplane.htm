<p><font color="#008000">How to get there</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Go to the Ferrott, stick to your left, swim past the first river,
go past cazic thule, swim past the second river and before you reach the south/west corner
of the zone there is a hidden entrance to your left. This is the spectra hidden cave, you
will need invisibility to undead to go through safely. In the cave stick to your right
more or less, it takes about 30 seconds to get to the exit of the cave. When you exit the
cave you will see a <a href="portal.jpg">giant portal</a> which leads to the plane of
fear, better go through quickly as there is an NPC called Cindreela near the <a href="portal.jpg">portal</a> and she's not friendly.</font></p>

<p><font color="#008000">The zone </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The zone itself is not very big, aside from the <a href="portal.jpg">portal</a> it has a <a href="castle.jpg">castle</a> which I have yet to
explore, a few pillars, a couple of <a href="house.jpg">houses</a> (with undead inside)
and the rest of the zone is forest like. The castle has a fire wall around it which is
like lava, you will take about 100 damage swimming across it. The zone is pretty crowded
in terms of the number of monsters compared to the size of the zone. And all the mobs in
the zone are wanderers, including cazic thule himself. All the mobs in the zone are over
level 40, most are over 45.</font></p>

<p><font color="#008000">Bestiary</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="cazict.jpg">Cazic thule</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF">
- He is a shadowknight, hits for 185, casts some nasty DOT spells. Like all shadowknights
he can harm touch, and it hurts. His pet is very weak (since he is a shadow knight
probably). When you attack him, all the mobs in the area will go aggro on you. He wanders
around the zone usually the other side of the castle (if you're coming from the portal).</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="dread.jpg">Dread</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> - a
unique mob. You will find him at his small temple at -550, -1230. He is guarded by two
Amygdalan knights. I have no idea what are his offensive abilities as the Amygdalan
knights always killed me before I got a chance to find out (they seem to be more
aggressive than him.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="fright.jpg">Fright</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> -
Same as Dread. Only this one looks like a clay golem instead of a stone.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="scareling.jpg">Scareling</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF">
(they are the little red flying thing you see in the screenshot) - One of the nastiest
mobs in the plane of fear. They hit for 117 lightning fast and backstab for 369. They also
teleport you to different points of the zone upon hitting you sometimes. They are very
fast and also have a huge range of sight, they can and will (they are very agressive) go
aggro on you from very far away. And if that's not enough they are so small and they move
so fast it's really hard to detect them before they attack you.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="nightmare.jpg">Nightmare</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF">
- They look like black horses, hit for 139+&nbsp; and cast a fear spell. They are not very
aggressive and are not likely to attack you if you run by em.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="shiverback.jpg">Shiverback</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> - Guerilla like mobs. They hit for 117 and kick for 37. They also have
some sort of a cold attack which is triggered when they hit you but I'm not sure what it
does. They drop Shiverback-hide armor which is Monk only.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="amyg.jpg">Amygdalan</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> -
I've seen two types of Amygdalans, warriors and knights. They are shadowknights and They
usually don't wander around and only hang around near the castle and dread/fright.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="glarelord.jpg">Glare lord</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> - They look like Evil Eyes, only they are magicians. They hit for 139 and
cast very nasty spells including a mana draining spell.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="phob.jpg">Phoboplasm</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> -
Weird looking mobs, they don't seem to cast spells but they can sure pack a punch. They
hit for 139 and kick for 47. Even though they scowl at me, they never attacked me before I
attacked them.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="phant.jpg">Phantasm</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> -
Spectra looking mob. They slice for 139 and cast very nasty spells including a stun spell
that lasts a very long time (and they cast it instantly while moving towards you
ofcourse).</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="samhain.jpg">Samhain</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> -
Another wierd looking mob, you will find them mostly near dread and fright. They hit for
139+ and don't seem to cast any spells.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="boogey.jpg">Boogeyman</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> -
They look like a combination of a goblin and a froglok. Very agressive and hit for over
139. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="gorgon.jpg">Gorgon</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> -
They hit for 139 and don't seem to cast any spells. They are also not too agressive and
you would probably be able to walk behind one without him attacking you.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><a href="dracholiche.jpg">Dracholiche</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> - They hit for 170 and are pretty agressive and rare. They drop
necromancer armor.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Spinechiller spider - They look like white spiders. They hit
pretty hard and poison as well, they drop caster armor.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Turmoil Toad - They are pretty rare but incredibly nasty. They
look like small frogloks and are one of the fastest mobs I've seen yet. They hit very hard
and I believe they can charm and fear. Both times I encountered one I was charmed and
killed before I could get a screenshot.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Worry wairth - They look like willowisps, but they are
enchanters. They hit for 139 and cast all those nasty enchanter spells.</font></p>

<p><font color="#008000">Fighting tactics</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The biggest problem in the plane of fear is getting mobbed. The
first problem you encounter is zoning in, you need everyone to zone in at the same time
because you don't want to be alone there for more than a few seconds as a few mobs can
jump you as soon as you zone. Walking around there and fighting the wandering mobs in the
middle of the forest is suicide, sooner or later you will be jumped by more mobs than you
can handle, not to mention your tanks will get teleported away by scarelings and bring
trains or die. What I suggest is to follow the left wall as you zone in and head to 1350,
-1400. This is a high place which is more or less a safe spot, very few mobs will wander
to that area. When you get there keep all your party there and have one person pull to the
party. That is a pretty big and comfortable area, you can spend alot of time there and be
relatively safe and get great loot and exp. Scarelings are less of a problem there because
first of all they don't seem to wander to that area much and secondly if you are near a
zone line you're usually not teleported far. Just make sure you root everything and don't
pull cazic thule by accident!</font></p>

<p><font color="#008000">Killing Cazic Thule</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Cazic Thule himself is not very mighty, Lord Nagfen for example
is much tougher. However, in order to have a chance of killing him you must clear out the
zone first. As things are now, nothing respawns in the zone unless it crashes. It seems,
fighting boogeyman makes the zone crash. So if you leave the boogeyman alone and kill
everything else, you should find it easy to pull cazic alone. Unless you have alot of
necromancers, killing cazic will take quite a few people and quite a bit of time. You will
need alot of tanks and alot of clerics. Wizards and the like are very ineffective against
cazic thule as he is a flat resist. However if you have alot of necromancers (say 10 level
50 necromancers), killing cazic is a piece of cake (assuming you cleared out the zone
first). Send out a few tanks and the necromancer pets and have the necromancers start life
tapping (level 49 life tap does 350 damage and is unresistable). Cazic Thule will most
likely die before the necromancers are oom and without many casualties. </font></p>
