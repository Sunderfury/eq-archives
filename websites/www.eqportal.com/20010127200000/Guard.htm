<p>Guard Killing</p>
<p>Okay, here are some ideas for fixing this problem. Please let me know what 
  you think or better let Verant know what you think. Petition and tell them what 
  ideas you like. For those who think Guard killing is a great idea go ahead and 
  petition as well. I'm fair, so let Verant know if you want to keep on doing 
  it why they should let you.</p>
<p>A) Add some risk to what is considered one of the safest methods of getting 
  exp. in the game.<br>
  Add a captain or inspector who wanders by, preferably with a caster escort. 
  This just makes sense, especially with all the killing that is going on. I mean 
  these are supposed to be intelligent races of Norrath right? Along the same 
  lines some kind of support staff should be around to buff and heal them. Would 
  you be a guard under these conditions after you retire from adventuring?</p>
<p>B) Have a spawn for the Town Militia or a special retired local Hero who appears 
  when so many guards die in a short time. I mean the idea that guards are camped 
  and killed over and over again as fast as they appear is what is really messed 
  up. This would allow the ones who do it for RP purposes or to accomplish a quest 
  to continue to do so. It would just make life risky for the campers.</p>
<p>C) Have consequences for this kind of action.<br>
  If you kill a Guard of most races of Norrath (Freeport being an exception) those 
  who live in and around that town should come to despise you. Add more Quests 
  so that the towns are considered important. Steamfont guards are camped so much 
  because the guards are so cooperative about it in their placement and because 
  there is nothing in Ak'anon that anyone really wants. Fix this for all towns. 
  Killing a bunch of guards should have some consequence that is not lightly dismissed. 
  Encouraging murder is something that Verant should expect to get in real political 
  trouble once the right parents find out...</p>
<p>D) This is a favorite, though I realize it will be the most work by Verant 
  and may not even be feasible. However it is the best Role-playing option so 
  I include it anyway. <br>
  Make it so that natives of a region can either buff and heal a Guard or actually 
  join in the fight. In the beginning we could buff and heal monsters and this 
  was later coded against because it was considered PvP switch avoidance. Characters 
  are flagged as to their home city so set it up so that those with the flag for 
  the city can buff and heal the guards. Another option on this would be to set 
  it so that natives could be treated like a city guild and those who attack the 
  guards are set to guildwar with the city natives with a duration of either 1 
  day or till they zone (whichever can be done). This would allow us to defend 
  the guards instead of standing around helplessly and encourage a sense of community 
  and Role-play. An even better variation on this would be to allow players to 
  Quest to become Watchman, deputies, or other Guards. This could give them access 
  to the command switch the Guides and GMs use /become NPC but ONLY in the regions 
  the Guard Quest was made for. I.e., Deputies in Rivervale and Misty Thicket 
  and Watchman in Ak'anon and Steamfont. This command is already zone dependent 
  and is nullified when the PC zones or camps so has built in protection. If as 
  an NPC your allowed to fight others this would go a LONG way to making the Common 
  laws (A Fenin Ro initiative) enforceable. Add the tag &quot;Deputy&quot; or 
  &quot;Watchman&quot; to the PC's name when they are 'On Duty' so everyone can 
  see what is going on and be aware they have a local intelligent guard to deal 
  with. This last method is an absolutely stunning way to encourage community 
  and RP but can result in some abuse. However the petition system can take care 
  of it and the GM could enter a flag that turns off the option or says the character 
  has not completed the Quest. If a real community is formed then the locals would 
  be able to police themselves and make the Guide workload easier. If several 
  deputies tell someone that they are out of line and that to continue will result 
  in petitioning then the activity might stop. If not then two or three deputies 
  also petitioning you should get it nailed down pretty fast and make it easy 
  for a Guide to decide who is in the wrong.</p>

<p> No wimpy high elf is gonna come into steamfont and push us around, and killing 
  guards is about the last stand. After being constantly killed at my lower lvls 
  by running to the guards, and finding out some idiot is killing em, i would 
  have to say to increase their speed, give the guards a lot of factions to get 
  worse for, i dont know of anything that is resistant to magic, but make em resistant 
  to magic also. Sneakyman "The Gnome Assassin"</p>

<p>Make all guards that roam Norrath be in the same faction group. i.e. You kill 
  a few Nektulos Guards and the Freeport Guards want your head for killing the 
  other hard working guards of the world.</p>

<p>I back the idea of a small squad/patrol of 4 invincible guards. They could 
  spawn at random times, say three times per 24 real hours, and/or they could 
  spawn in response to excessive guard killing. These guards would be ultra quick 
  and kill the tuffest character in 3 or 4 blows, immune to every sort of damage 
  or deception. They would run through the zone attacking anyone who has killed/attacked 
  a guard in that zone since their last spawn. This would force people to leave, 
  or at least have a vicious consequence to their actions. I would also like to 
  see the guard squad in special uniforms. All you have to do is visit Oggok and 
  see how camped the Ogre home city is, dead guards and crude steins everywhere. 
  It is just plain sick. I would not want to make a new character and see my city 
  under constant siege by every other race. <br>

<p>I too use the guards to save my hide often enough to want this killing to be 
  controlled. What I suggest is that the supervisor (new guard type) is given 
  teleport capabilities. He is going to be able to port into a location when a 
  guard is under attack. I have seen many cases where a player is able to bring 
  a set of MOB to a guard and the player died because there was only one guard 
  available. It would be good to have a "backup" guard available at times like 
  this using teleport to get there. Of coarse there is only one of these per area 
  so he could be busy else where when you need him. <br>
</p>
<p> P.S. The idea of "Were teaching our young people to kill police officers now?" 
  is completely silly. We are teaching our children the difference between fantasy 
  and reality with this game. You are killing everything (including PvP) in EQ. 
  It is not an example of reality for anyone. It does release the stress of uncontrollable 
  life and lets you take matters into your own hands for a while. I love this 
  game! <br>

<p>Your right that the comment I made about teaching to kill Police Officers is 
  extreme and silly. However it is something that I expect to see brought up by 
  a parents or morallist group and am surprised it has not happened yet. I have 
  seen people complain and attmept to kill a game becasue they thought that it 
  was sacriligious since it involved demon killing.</p>

<p>What sort of people are we dealing with when addressing guard killing issues? 
  Although Guard killing is well practiced in some areas (Ogre and Gnomish, or 
  Freeport toll guards for example), other places are relatively kill-free. Making 
  all guard killing near-impossible, or more difficult, would be a step, but in 
  which direction? (Brother Zephyl and the Qeynos Lieutenants come to mind). The 
  alternative? Make them lower level guards, but similar to Dorns, or the guards 
  on the HG area in Rathe Mountains. Add more of them. The ones that carry quests 
  should be Brother Zephyl's, and placed strategically to avoid ingres to the 
  city. No-one will bother killing them then. There would need to be a 'murderer-general' 
  faction penalty or it will be no deterrant for true 'evil' races that would 
  be KoS in the area anyway. I have seen a general increase in the practice as 
  the server population has increased...but so many areas are now so busy anyway, 
  that some dungeoneering is near pointless. Splitpaw is STILL practically empty 
  at peak times. Was it was meant to redress the sort of early experience that 
  guard killing produced? It's unsafe. It's full of easily agro'd creatures. Why 
  is anyone who can safely camp guards for several hours going to go in a place 
  like that? </p>
