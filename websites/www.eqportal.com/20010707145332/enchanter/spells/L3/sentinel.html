    <td width="608" valign="top" height="665" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">Another utility spell, this
    has little combat value. &nbsp; Its a little peculiar in that you can not cancel it like
    other spells.&nbsp; A spell icon does not appear in the upper corner of your screen like
    other spells, instead you will be surrounded by an orb of sparkling lights that leave
    trails when you run sufficiently impressive to make a bard pale with envy.&nbsp;
    Unfortunately, you will be the only one to be able to see this effect.&nbsp; You will know
    the spell has ended when the sparkles go away.&nbsp; Anyone entering within the area of
    your sentinel's affect will be informed that they feel watched.<p>Once cast the area on
    the spell is sufficiently wide enough and sufficiently long enough to provide a measure of
    safety while meditating. &nbsp; It does not give you visual feedback, rather, it sends any
    movement to your text message box.&nbsp; If anything, be it player or npc, enters the
    range or even moves from a stationary position within it you will receive a message giving
    you its name and that it has moved within your sentinel's perimeter.&nbsp; Sentinel is
    also good for revealing concealed or invisible players.&nbsp; While you won't see them,
    you will see an orb of sparkling light wherever something triggers your sentinel (if you
    are within visible limit of the occurance) accomanied by the text message of who, or what,
    just triggered your sentinel.</p>
    <p>There is a limit on how far away you can move before you will no longer receive input
    from the sentinel, however it remains in affect and you can fall back into the range and
    resume receiving input.&nbsp; You'll have to play with the spell to determine the range to
    a point of your understanding.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>This spell can also be used to monitor a nearby repop.&nbsp; If you're waiting for a
    specific npc to return, either to hunt it or speak with it when it returns from traveling
    or being killed, you can cast sentinel near its repop point and go off to do something
    else.&nbsp; You will be alerted when it returns.&nbsp; Always a good way to keep track of
    when the boat arrives at the dock.&nbsp; A word of caution though, on busy docks you're
    likely to annoy everyone there with the &quot;you feel that you are being watched&quot;
    message they will continue to receive the entire time the spell is in effect.</p>
    <p>Sentinel is particularly good in dungeons or places with long halls.&nbsp; You can cast
    it at one location and move further down the hall.&nbsp; If anything comes running in your
    general direction you will receive that much more warning before it reaches you.&nbsp; Not
    much beats a few seconds warning when sitting at the zone entrance of Crushbone and you
    see Amassador D'vinn, Emporer Crush and several of his attendants come barreling down the
    hall chasing someone.&nbsp; If there's just you and they die or zone in time that leaves
    you the only target and that's not a place you want to be standing when that happens.</p>
    <p>Its also useful to note that you can cast multiple sentinel spells.&nbsp; You will have
    no way of knowing which is being triggered, other than actually looking, but it does allow
    you to set up an effective perimeter watch.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Oddities:&nbsp; If you cast minor illusion, keeping you stationary, then cast sentinel,
    then remove the <a href="../L1/minor%20illusion.html" target="_self">minor illusion</a>
    affect, the sparkling affect will remain centered on where you cast it and you will be
    able to move around without the flashing lights interfering with your field of vision.</p>
    <p>Another oddity, if you cast sentinel, then cast any other illusion spell, such as <a
    href="../L2/illusion%20human.html" target="_self">illusion: human</a>, the visual affect
    disapears. &nbsp; Even after you remove the illusion the sparkling affect does not
    return.&nbsp; The only way to tell it has disipated is that you will simply no longer
    receive information on the targeted area.</td>
