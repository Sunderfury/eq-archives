    <td width="24%" valign="top">Tips:</td>
    <td width="76%" valign="top">For the exploring mage, this spell provides you with a great
    deal of freedom.&nbsp; You are now able to explore far away areas without the fear of
    death resulting in a three hour journey just to recover your corpse.&nbsp; Simply bind
    yourself at a safe point, a nearby town or guard perhaps, near the area you will be
    exploring.<p>This spell also makes those money runs that much easier.&nbsp; As most mages
    have a noticable deficit in the area of strength, any serious amount of time spent
    gathering goods to sell in town can rappidly overwhelm their meager capacity to haul loot
    the distances required.&nbsp; By simply binding yourself in front of your favorite shop
    keeper you can now hunt and scavenge until you can barely crawl about then <a
    href="../L2/gate.html">gate</a> straight to the shop saving you valuable carrying time.</p>
    <p>Two final points on functionality.&nbsp; First, while mages can bind themselves just
    about anywhere (the ships being the only exception that comes to mind) they can only bind
    other people in town zones.&nbsp; A few zones, such as Greater Faydark, Qeynos Hills, and
    such that have towns in the same zone as commonly hunted creatures are popular as you can
    bind others anywhere in them even though they are both town and non-town type zones.</p>
    <p>Lastly, this is a consent spell.&nbsp; Consent spells are those that require the
    consent of the target to work.&nbsp; How does your target consent?&nbsp; By being grouped
    with you.&nbsp; Anyone grouped with you has essentially consented to any spells you wish
    to cast on them, such as Bind Affinity or <a href="../L2/invisibility.html">Inivisibility</a>.</p>
    <p>This was done to prevent abuse from one player by another.&nbsp; As an example, binding
    a troll between two guards could cause the troll to be slain every time he reloaded from
    being killed.&nbsp; Eventually this will lead to the troll character being reduced back to
    level 5 or so where they stop losing experience from being killed.&nbsp; Requiring consent
    fixes the problem, for the most part.&nbsp; The situation can could still exist, but
    requires a measure of deception now rather than simply targeting a victim running
    willy-nilly past the guards.</td>
