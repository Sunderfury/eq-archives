<B>Solusek's Eye</B><BR>
(Currently only a guide for low to mid 20th season adventurers)<BR><BR>
Although we prefer not to venture into dungeons, a visit to Solusek may be a very worthwhile trip. The tales of treasures found there are simply amazing, yet thankfully there are very few who hunt there. <B><FONT COLOR=&FF0000>[Update: It was not very crowded <I>4 months ago</I>, but now Solusek is rediculously camped. There are still a few areas very few people are aware of, but these spots are rapidly dwindling.]</FONT></B> However, as druids, many of our spells only function outside, and the majority of our more powerful spells are fire-based. And unfortunately, almost everything in Solusek has a very high fire resistance.<BR><BR>
If we have so many disadvantages, why should we hunt there? For the most part it is undiscovered. Some of the most hardened, experienced warriors and wizards who fight in Nagafen's lair can be spotted here, exploring Solusek's depths. It is huge dungeon, perhaps even the size of Guk. Hopefully the following information will assist any who are interested in visiting..<BR><BR>
<B>Resting and Fetching</B><BR><BR>
Fearing hordes of angry goblins, many young adventurers will remain at the entrance from Lavastorm. Unless you are alone or with a very small party, this is not advised. Being overwhelmed by goblins is certainly not a pleasant thought, but falling in lava can be far worse. To avoid such a fate, a much safer resting place can be found further in..<BR><BR>
Go through the hole in the wall and take a right. This will lead you to a larger room with a stone door. There is a hall to the right that leads to a very safe area, conveniently located near an entrance to Nagafen's lair. This is probably where your party will want to rest.<BR><BR>
If your party is forced to retreat into Nagafen, <I>do not remain there long!</I> Greater kobolds inflict 72 damage per attack. A 30th season party could safely take on a kobold, but one should be very cautious there.<BR><BR>
There are a number of spots to fetch, depending on your group. Fetching from the door can possibly result in up to five goblins, including Fires and some Infernos. Be very wary here, it may look like the goblins are alone, but <I>more will come</I>. If your party does manage to take care of these, you can either continue to fetch them one-by-one from the door or rest in front of the gate (behind the door).<BR><BR>
If your party is not quite so experienced, Young, Cinder, and Flame goblins may be a better choice. These may be found generally outside the door. Wizards of any sort, however, can be extremely dangerous (Force shock).. do not underestimate them.<BR><BR>
..Hopefully more to come..
