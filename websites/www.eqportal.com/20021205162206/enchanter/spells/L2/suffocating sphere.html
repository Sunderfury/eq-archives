    <td width="607" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">One of the best battle spells you'll have
    for a while. &nbsp; The biggest drawback of a DoT (damage over time) spell is that you
    will need to actually survive long enough for it to achieve its full potential.&nbsp;
    You'll either want to draw your target's attention with this spell or, at least, cast it
    early on in combat.&nbsp; Its biggest benefit is that it has a decent damage ratio,
    exchanging a lowered mana cost versus damage done for its slower effect.<p>Its also great
    in groups. &nbsp; Frequently the mage in a group casts a few spells then meditates for
    mana while the rest continue to pummel the target to a pulp.&nbsp; Unless you're mana
    needs to be reserved for other spells right away, I find this is a nice way to assist in
    the thrashing even while meditating.</p>
    <p>How effective is it?&nbsp; I found myself soloing black bears at about level 6. &nbsp;
    Perhaps not a great feat, but I was doing it without a pet.&nbsp; All I would do was blast
    it with Suffocating Sphere once to get its attention, beat it with my stick until the
    spell wore off, then cast it again.&nbsp; Typically it woul only take two of these spells
    and a little time to finish off a bear.</p>
    <p>Get used to using this one too as you won't see your next DoT until level 12 when you
    can aquire the 4th rank spell Choke. </td>
