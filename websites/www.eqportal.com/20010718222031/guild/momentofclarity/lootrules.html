<i>Loot Rules</i></h2>

<FONT SIZE=3>

Being late:&nbsp; If you are late to a raid, you must wait 2 hours,
or 1 random for your class, before you can enter
randoms, whichever comes first.&nbsp; (This is primarily for planes
- other raids are at the officers discretion).&nbsp; Posting
that you will be late (or acts of God) do NOT exempt you from late
penalties.&nbsp; Late is defined as arriving after the
first pull of the raid.&nbsp; If you are in transit to the raid, the
raid officers can take that into consideration.&nbsp; You will be told
if you are subject to the two hour limit, and if you are unsure, ask
a raid leader.
<p>If:
<br>1) No one else can use the item, or
<br>2) All others who can use the item have it, or
<br>3) You were brought in late for the specific purpose that the raid
could not continue without you, <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspthen you can random for the item.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Loot Priority:
<p>Primary character - The main character you
play.&nbsp; You need to pick one as your Primary.
<br>Secondary characters - Another character (even
high level) that is not your Primary character.
<BR>
<BR>

<UL>
<P>
If a Secondary character is asked to go on the raid for the use of their 
skills, then for the raid, they are considered a Primary character. You have 
to be on the raid to be eligible for loot from the raid.
&nbsp; (There are rare circumstances like class specific loot being dropped
and nobody of that class to loot the item).&nbsp; In that case the item will 
go up for general random.
</P>
</UL>

Single class specific loot:
<UL>
<P>
Goes to Class Primary characters of the class that <a href="#need">need</a> 
it first. If there is no Class Primary on the raid to loot the item 
(or no Class Primary on the raid wants the item), then the item will go up for 
<a href="#general random">general random</a>.
</P>
</UL>


Non Class Specific loot:
<UL>
<P>
Always goes to Primary characters that can use it most.&nbsp; (The officers/raid 
leaders will decide if need be).&nbsp; You will not be allowed to random for an 
item that you would not use daily.&nbsp;If no Primary will use it daily, then the 
item can go up for general random to all Primary characters that can use it.
If no Primary wants it that can use it, it will go up for general random.
</P>
</UL>

Spell Drops:
<UL>
<P>
Any spells that drop will go to the classes (present when the spell drops) who 
need the spell. If no one present needs the spell, then the spell will be 
offered (over guild channel) to see if anyone in the guild needs the spell. 
If multiple people in the guild need the spell, it will be randomed among them. 
If no one in the guild needs the spell, it will go up for general random.
</P>
</UL>

Loot rules in a pick-up group:
<UL>
<P>
If you are in a pick-up group, or invited on a raid with a different guild, 
please abide by thier loot rules.
</P>
</UL>

<p><a NAME="need"></a><font color="#B0C4DE">Need</font>:
<br>-An item that is an upgrade to an item you are currently using.
<br>-An item that you would use daily.
<br>-An item that will remain equipped until you find a better item to
replace it.
<p><a NAME="general random"></a><font color="#B0C4DE">General Random</font>
(a.k.a. gravy loot):
<br>-The item you win in a general random is yours to do with as you please.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; examples:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -sell it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -twink with it .
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -trade it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -give it to a fellow guildmate that may need it (highly
recommended).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -offer it to fellow guildmates at a reduced price.
