    <td width="149" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">Tips:</td>
    <td width="608" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">The spell has no real combat value other
    than reconnaissance. &nbsp; When cast you see the view from the x,y zone coordinates of
    your target and their facing.&nbsp; You do not, however, see the angle at which they see
    nor their view. &nbsp; Specifically, if they meditate or study spells and such, you will
    still see what's around them and not their spellbook.<p>One fun thing to notice is that
    you can target other creatures thorugh the sight of someone you're already bound to.&nbsp;
    In this way you can &quot;Sight Walk&quot; an entire zone by hopping from one player or
    creature to another.&nbsp; There seems to be no limit to the range of this spell other
    than staying within your zone.&nbsp; If you have it targeted, you can see from its
    position and if its targeted you can /con it.&nbsp; Want to know if something is
    aggressive to you?&nbsp; Bind sight to something nearby and target what you're curious
    about and consider it.</p>
    <p>Another good use for this is to keep an eye on meditating spellcasters.&nbsp; If your
    not nearby to watch over them but have them targeted you can use bind sight to view their
    position.&nbsp; You can use the camera angle (F9 key) to shift to an external view seeing
    them and their nearby surroundings to keep an eye on them while they are meditating and
    can only see their spellbook.</p>
    <p>This is also a good way to guide party members who are lost or less learned about the
    topography of the zone you are in.&nbsp; Target the party member from your party list (so
    long as they are in your zone you can do this) and bind sight to them.&nbsp; You'll see
    from their facing and location and you can /tell or /gsay instructions to them guiding
    them elsewhere.</p>
    <p>What about strangers?&nbsp; Worried about the politeness of casting spells like this on
    another player?&nbsp; Don't be.&nbsp; There is no message that you've targeted or cast a
    spell on them and they will never know you're tagging along unless you tell them.</p>
    <p>What about your own body?&nbsp; Well, you can still run, sit, cast, rearrange inventory
    and gear and more while sight bound.&nbsp; Although, unless you can see yourself through
    the target's eyes, I wouldn't go running willy-nilly where you can't see.&nbsp; Usually,
    if &quot;Sight Walking&quot; a zone I simply make myself sit so I know where I'll be when
    I return.&nbsp; Although you see through your target's location, you hear what is near
    your actual location so you will know by sound and text box anything said or happening
    around you.&nbsp; If you get attacked you'll see your life draining, the text of being hit
    and hear the damage benig done.&nbsp; You can even meditate while bound.&nbsp; If you try
    to meditate it will place your spellbook on your screen blocking out the view even though
    you are still bound.&nbsp; So long as the spell hasn't disipated, when you close your
    spellbook you'll return to your target's view.</p>
    <p>Oddities:&nbsp; Sometimes you will get stuck on their x,y access even though they are
    moving.&nbsp; It will seem as if they are standing still when, in truth, they have moved
    on.&nbsp; This only seems to happen at the initial casting.&nbsp; If your perspective
    moves with theirs then the spell has worked fine.</p>
    <p>Also, you lose move/endurance points while using this spell.&nbsp; While the spell does
    have a duration, a fairly long one, it also seems to disipate if you run out of endurance
    while it is still active.</td>
