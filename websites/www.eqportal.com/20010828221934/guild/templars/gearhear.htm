    <li><p align="left"><em><strong>Talk to the main warrior
        guild master, he will want you to kill a defective robot
        named Gearheart. He will tell you that Gearheart has been
        captured by the faeries and you must travel to Lesser Fay
        to slay him.</strong></em></p>

    <li><p align="left"><em><strong>Travel to Lesser Fay.
        Gearheart randomly spawns in one of two locations, the
        first is in the middle of the fairy village and the
        second is near the Steamfont zone by the observatory. If
        he is in the fairy village DO NOT attack him unless you
        are able to kill all the fairy guards that will come to
        his aid! Wait until he wanders off (hardly ever happens)
        or until he spawns at the other location.</strong></em></p>

    <li><p align="left"><em><strong>Once you locate Gearheart in
        a safe location, kill him. He is level 17. Once slain, he
        will drop Gearheart's gearbox.</strong></em></p>

    <li><p align="left"><em><strong>Take the gearbox back to the
        warrior that started the quest and give it to him. He
        will give you a good gnome faction adjustment,
        experience, some coin, and a random piece of raw-hide
        armor.</strong></em></p>
