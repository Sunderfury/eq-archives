<p>News: </p>
<p>03/12/00 - ok holy shit</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Long time since i updated. Alot has happened though. I abandon AC again, 
    so i no longer play it or EQ...though i still have my accounts for both =/<br>
    EQGuise is offically retired. Moving onto bigger and better games. Currenly 
    im a beta tester for a mmorpg called <a href="http://www.glitchless.com">Dawn</a>. 
    Been a big fan for a while now, perhaps one day i will create a &quot;Dawn 
    Guise&quot; well i would call it something different cause that sounds gay 
    but you get the idea. Im currently working for a net company called NetEmp, 
    whos making an RPG called the after. I do digital art, concept, and web designing. 
    This page is very ugly and dosnt show my web designing skills but why fix 
    it up when its a dead page. </p>
  <p>I also just pre-ordered a game called <a href="www.bwcenter.com">Black &amp; 
    White</a>. Its a RTS RPG SIM game. You take on the role of a god, and try 
    to get people to worship you and you raise a titan. Your titan is an animal 
    you pick from the wild and claim it as your titan. He will grow to massive 
    size over time, and it will learn from you...like a digital pet. It has the 
    most advanced AI and physics system ever seen. If you reward your titan every 
    time he starts a fire, he will become a pyromaniac. If you reward him every 
    time he picks up a human and throws them. He will grow up to be a organic 
    catipult. You can be a good god, nutral god, or evil god. Hence the name Black 
    &amp; White. An EQ example would be: you can be Tunare, or Cazic Thule. Have 
    people that worship you because they love you, or worship you because they 
    fear you. It looks very fun and is supposed to come out march 27th.</p>
  <p>Anyway, if i ever do start a dawn guise or maybe even a Black &amp; White 
    page, check back here, I will probably have a link to it. Assuming EQPortal 
    is still running. </p>

<p>01/16/00 - =(</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ok, well, got bored of eq again and started playing AC...again, im waiting 
    for a new AC server to come up called Wintersebb. Some friends and I have 
    a planned monarch(guild) If you play AC and were thinking about playing on 
    the new server when it comes up, and want to be a vassle of mine in the new 
    monarch we will make. Email me at <a href="mailto:nadger@efortress.com">nadger@efortress.com</a></p>
  <p>If i get real into Asheron's Call, I may end up starting something like AC 
    Guise or something. Though it will be hard to make weapons and armor that 
    look better then the ones they have now. Excellent weapons and armor graphics 
    already on AC, so i doubt i will do much AC Guise ;)</p>
  <p>Anyway if your interested in the monarch email me.</p>
  <p>as far as EQ and EQGuise goes....i may give eq another shot once they patch 
    the experiance system....its been real hard on me (troll shaman...bad penalty)</p>
  <p>and as far as updates go, don't expect many. I might make some more soloist 
    weapons for the other classes that cant solo. But other then that, i don't 
    have anything planned</p>
  <p>I just need a change from Everquest, so Asheron's Call did it for me. I have 
    a lvl 15 Character on the thisledown server that I am using as a test character 
    for my battlemage template. I have been having much more fun on AC then iv 
    had on EQ since its realease. Hopefully AC will hold me over until <a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons">Horizons</a> 
    comes out </p>

<p>12/24/00 - hehe</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ok well eq just locked up and i just got back from rebooting and i thought 
    i would drop a word before i forget.</p>
  <p>i have a few new cool ideas for items ill do sometime...but as far as eqguise 
    program goes...i need to fix it so it has the damn slot: thing now</p>

<p>12/18/00 - Im getting old - OK SCREW THECOUNTER.COM</p>
<p>ok thecounter.com blows ass, its been slowing my site down waaay to much so 
  i said screw it i dont care how many hits im getting, i would prob get more 
  if it didnt take so damn long to load thecounter...so as of now...its gone</p>
<p>well i did it again, messed up the stats of something...before i had the wrong 
  effect and wrong classes on the bloodstained flamberge...i had &quot;Dark Fear&quot; 
  as effect insted of shackles of fear, and i had ranger 2 times on there, and 
  not shadowknight. I fixed it though.</p>
<p>Ok you wizards have waited long enough!</p>

<p>12/17/00 - Bugs/New Weapon</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ok, iv been alerted of several bugs in EQ Guise 3.0, so what I'm going to 
    do is keep version 3.0 out there a little longer until I feel all the bugs 
    have been found, then I will put up version 3.1, with all those bugs fixed.</p>
  <p>I'm a shaman, and I don't know what I would do if I couldn't solo. So I felt 
    bad for classes that couldn't So I'm making weapons that will allow them to 
    solo</p>
  <p>Today's version is for 2H slashers.</p>
  <p>Bloodstained Flamberge of the Soloist - <a href="IMAGES/Weapons/bloodsword.jpg">Wielded</a>, 
    <a href="IMAGES/Weapons/BloodstainedFlamberge.jpg">Stats</a></p>
  <p>The Effect: Shackles of Fear; is a proc that snares the mob, and fears it. 
    It lasts for 40 seconds - This allows the sword weilder to slash at the mob's 
    backside while it slowly runs away.</p>
  <p>I was hesitant to make this sword useable by paladins, as a fear type effect 
    just dosnt fit them, but i decided they NEED this sword so i gave it to them 
    ;)</p>
  <p>I also had a nice dmg/delay in mind for this sword, it might make the owners 
    of this sword want to use it all the time...but its effect prevents that. 
    You dont want a feared mob in a dungeon, so they would be forced to use a 
    different sword. So this restores some balance to it.</p>
  <p>While these items are fake...i try to keep them within verants range...how 
    interesting would these items and site be if all the weapons were lke 9999 
    dmg 10 delay? So i try to make it interesting, original, but still kick ass 
    ;) </p>

<p>12/15/00 - Download it Now - Fixed link (eqportal having probs with it, so 
  I uploaded it temperately to my xoom account)</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://members.xoom.com/MacroPerfect/eqg3.exe">download</a> 
  it now</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ok I made a self extracting .exe file for eqguise 3.0, it has all the DLLs 
    and all the files you need. Turned out to only be 2.5 MB<br>
    You can download it <a href="http://members.xoom.com/MacroPerfect/eqg3.exe">here</a>.<br>
    Or access it from the <a href="downloads.HTM">downloads</a> section</p>
  <p>Its best to leave c:\ as the extract directory, it makes its own /eqguise 
    directory</p>
  <p>Wizards, just hold on ;) Don't have time to do your kunark armor right now, 
    I slept in and am missing 1st period right now as I'm writing this, so I need 
    to hurry and upload so I can make it to 2nd period ;)</p>
  <p>I think I'm going to start playing eq again, my shamans been stuck on lvl 
    51, and now a friend of mine has caught up to me, going to duo group with 
    him, because soloing in burningwood is very boring. Plus I owe it to ashen 
    vendetta (guild) to lvl up.</p>
  <p>Updated downloads section, added soon to come projects.</p>

<p>12/12/00 - EQGuise 3.0 done</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Well im done with it, just need to make sure everything works right and make 
    sure my tutorials dont loose anyone. So far iv tested the tutorials on 3 people, 
    all 3's responce was &quot;holy shit!&quot; &quot;this kicks ass!&quot; so 
    i figure the tutorials are good enough ;)</p>
  <p>I may end up uploading a finished version later today to tomorrow. Its going 
    to be fairly large...around 6MB total i think, those .PSD files im including 
    are large, the .exe alone is only 300KB, the .bmps for the damn icons are 
    around 1 MB...and the 2 DLL files around 500kb, not sure how much it will 
    all be zipped up, but hopefully its not to long of a download.</p>
  <p>Ah crap, almost forgot about the icons, i need to get/make some more of those 
    too. </p>
  <p>So whats new in version 3.0? here, ill paste a clipping from the &quot;Whats 
    New&quot; menu item from eqguise 3.0 ;)</p>
  <p>So whats new in 3.0? The Stat Wizard, Stat Examples, Bug Fixes, Corrected 
    Order of Stats/races/classes, Corrected instructions for making professional 
    stats, Corrected bug that would cause blank icon box to appear when you tried 
    to make items without an icon, fixed blue screen windows crash bug (whew!), 
    added more buttons to main interface, added shortcuts to menu items, added 
    new menu items, and tutorials for making weilded/worn pictures in photoshop, 
    and 5 saved photoshop files for you to play around with.</p>
  <p>You still cant save as JPG =( damn VB 4.0!</p>
  <p>maybe ill make an expansion pack later on...more icons, more photoshop files, 
    more tutorials, stuff like that</p>
  <p>OK WIZARDS, IMMA MAKE YOU WAIT 1 MORE DAY!</p>
  <p>I have all the stats and crap for wizard kunark figured out, i even have 
    the picture of wizard robe being worn done...i just need to slap them on stat 
    paper and update ;/</p>
  <p>Ill try to have them out to ya tomorrow...like any of u actually read all 
    this crap i type anyway ;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>12/10/00 - EQGuise Fake Stat Generator 3.0</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Well im sure all of you will be happy to hear im working on EQGuise 3.0. 
    Im creating the Stat Wizard right now, you can use it to create professional 
    looking stats in the right order and exactly like EverQuest's with a few clicks 
    of the mouse. 3.0 Also has new features like being able to load and save stats, 
    deity options, load examples of each type of item, new icons, and maybe....depends 
    on how lazy i am, just maybe ill add a few saved .psd (adobe photoshop files) 
    along with a tutorial on how to make your on screen shots of your item being 
    weilded/worn. Each file will contain saved selections and such and a seperate 
    .txt file for the tutorial, so you can read the tutorial as you try it out. 
    Also, i think im going to shorten the name to just EQ Guise 3.0.</p>
  <p>You can see a preview of the first page of Stat Wizard if you <a href="IMAGES/preview.jpg" target="_blank">click 
    here.</a></p>
  <p>Look at all those damn checkboxes, this thing is going to be a bitch to program, 
    and make it all work at 100%</p>
  <p>For you wizards out there who are anxious to see the kunark armor i made 
    for you, keep checking back, ill update with that armor very soon....on a 
    realated note, iv been looking at some of the new velious armor, trying to 
    get a grasp of what the stats are compaired to kunark type armor. Maybe ill 
    make some vellious armor, like i did with kunark armor, though i think every 
    class gets a vellious armor set already, ill have to keep an eye on the spoiler 
    sites.</p>
  <p>Also, check out <a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons/horizons.htm" target="_blank">Horizons</a>, 
    its a new MMORPG that iv been following the development of for a while now. 
    It looks to be the next game all us EverQuesters will be playing. Hell, maybe 
    ill even have a HZ Guise for Horizons someday. ;)</p>
  <p>One last personal thing, for all you fans of my work....I plan to become 
    a game programmer and or graphics artist...I want to work on a game like everquest 
    and horizons...so hopefully someday there will be a MMORPG out there that 
    i worked on and created awesome looking equipment for all us fashion consious. 
    I actually have about a 10 page long brainstorm of ideas already down for 
    an MMORPG that i make or work on.</p>
  <p>Help me get the site populated again, for lack of updates for those few months 
    a while back caused my hits per day to dwindle down to about 30 hits a day. 
    Tell your friends, advertise in chat rooms and all you webmasters out there, 
    link to me ;)</p>
  <p>Thanks,</p>
  <p>Nadger</p>

<p>12/02/00 - Questions/Woops!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ok first off, i made a mistake on my kunark necro legs...i forgot to put 
    the +stats on there...so i fixed em, have a look at them <a href="IMAGES/Armor/Death%27sSpectralLeggings.jpg">here</a></p>
  <p>2ndly i messed up again with the monk hand wraps...forgot to put a link to 
    them, view them <a href="IMAGES/Armor/Ton%20Po%27sMagicalHandWraps.jpg">here</a></p>
  <p>3rd of all, i stuck the new armor in the armor/robe sections</p>
  <p>Ok, iv been asked this question many times....Why don't you send your pictures 
    and ideas to Verant? The answer is that I would say a good 98% of the pictures 
    i make...for example...armor pictures, verant can't make. See when i make 
    my pictures, i can select certain areas of the armor/robe and change them 
    to be 1 color, then select the rest of the robe and change them to be another 
    color. Verant cannot do that. They have to change the color of the whole texture. 
    And on some of my pictures i put on an extra texture on to there...such as 
    stars on a robe, or fire on a robe. Verant cant do that either, they would 
    have to make a whole new texture in the global memory file...which would slow 
    down loading time and cause problems with texture memory on crappy video cards. 
    Also, another good example is what i did with the Monk Kunark armor...the 
    visible picture...they cant just tint it black...because the color of the 
    skin would change as well. For example...take a bloodstained tunic on a troll 
    male. It has holes in it...and where the holes are...the skin is supposed 
    to be colored green, but its colored red (like the tunic is).</p>
  <p>If Verants graphic engine didn't suck, they could do layerd transparentcys 
    and things like that to make much cooler looking things. But they are limited 
    by their engine, and minimum specs. If everquest were and offline game, they 
    wouldnt be so limited, and if they didnt use zones, they wouldnt be so limited. 
    Now i could expirement with color combos and contrast by doing the whole thing 
    at once like eq has to do...but they wouldnt look very good. i think verant 
    has found every color that looks decent. but maybe ill give it a shot.</p>
  <p>Ill post mage or wizard kunark armor soon.</p>
