    <td width="607" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">At lower levels I found this pet to be of little
    use.&nbsp; It tends to die way to quickly to provide much use and the cost of the
    component (10-15 coppers a piece) is more often outweighed by the need to buy spells and
    cloth armor early on.<br>
    <br>
    At higher levels (rank 2 at the earliest, certainly at rank 3 and on) the pet becomes much
    more useful if you spend a lot of time soloing.&nbsp; These pets like to taunt your
    attacker, drawing it off of you and allowing you the ease of casting without disruption
    from damage.<p>Words of caution, unlike normal pets these can not be commanded to attack
    or defend you.&nbsp; They are not true pets in that sense, rather, they will defend you
    after you first take damage.&nbsp; Unless you take damage in a fight it will not aid in
    combat, so if grouped with others and you want your pet to help you need to get hit at
    least once.</p>
    <p>Perhaps a bug, perhaps intentional, but if you allow your pet to get the killing blow
    it takes&nbsp; portion of the experience from the kill.&nbsp; If you, or a group member,
    gets the killing blow your animated pet does not seem to take a share of the experience
    from the split.</td>
