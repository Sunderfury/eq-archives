      <P align=left>The search for the Tattered Gnomish Cloak has finally ended! 
      The first Thermal Cloak has been created! See the <A 
      href="goldengear.html">Golden Gear 
      Awards</A> section for those that were involved with this great discovery. 
      To find out where to obtain the Tattered Gnomish Cloak and how to make the 
      Thermal Cloak, please see the <A 
      href="ingredients.html">Ingredients</A> 
      and <A href="recipes.html">Recipes</A> 
      sections.<BR>
      <HR>

      <P><BR>Abashi responded to our question regarding the Thermal Cloak, and 
      stated that the Tattered Gnomish Cloak is not in Norrath at this time. 
      Unfortunately, he did not directly state if this also meant that the 
      Thermal Cloak could not be produced, however most Gnomes are following the 
      assumption that this is also true, given that the Tattered Gnomish Cloak 
      is an important ingredient according to Gimblestan.<BR><BR></P>
      <HR>

      <P>Good news fellow Gnomes! A Bard just recently delivered a letter to me 
      from that Gnome of all Gnomes, Gnomad! The letter was faded and had 
      obviously traveled a long distance. I'm actually amazed that mail gets 
      through at all now that the Bards are relying on adventurers to run it 
      from depot to depot. Hmm, perhaps I should start work on a Mail Delivery 
      Clockwork...but I digress...<BR><BR>Within the letter, Gnomad states that 
      he has gone through his archives and has managed to find his old list of 
      Thermal Cloak failed attempts. Along with the enclosed list, Gnomad wished 
      us all good luck. I have posted this list in its entirety 
      below.<BR><BR>Regarding the failed attempts, many Gnomes and other races 
      have written in suggesting that a belt be used as part of the recipe for 
      the Thermal Cloak, as Gimblestan himself had written that he put his 
      firewater on a belt. This sounds like a great suggestion, and I can only 
      believe that it was not an option when Gnomad and other Gnomes first set 
      out to recreate Gimblestan's work. I was not a part of this and cannot 
      comment. My only thought would be that a suitable belt was not available 
      in the world, but I would appreciate it if a more seasoned Gnome could 
      shed some flameless light on this. <EM>UPDATE</EM>: See the Norbert item 
      below for some thoughts on the belt.<BR><BR></P></TD></TR>

      suggesting that the twice woven cloak found on the faeries in Lesser 
      Faydark be used in the construction of the Thermal Cloak. To date, this 
      has not been tested out. [<FONT face=Arial 
      size=2><STRONG>UPDATE</STRONG></FONT>: Gyro of Solusek Ro wrote in to let 
      us know that the twice woven cloak is used in a Temple of Ro

              <P><EM>Its possible and i think, tho farfetched, the firewater 
              belt and the cloack are two seperate items. Possible you have to 
              wear the belt and the cloak as individual items. Only a thought, 
              figured i'd add mine since in order to figure that out weWILL have 
              to work together on it.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>NEW</STRONG></FONT>: Antiginous Schmiginous of 
      Bertoxxulous has made small tattered cloaks in the past. The recipe was 1 
      ruined wolf pelt and a cloak pattern from High Hold Pass.<BR><BR><FONT 
      face=Arial><STRONG>NEW</STRONG></FONT>: <FONT size=3>Vaire of 
      Xegony</FONT> has heard that tailor patterns for a small tattered cloak 
      may be found in Kelethin.<BR><BR>Konaki Jiiji wrote in that in looking for 
      a Tattered Gnomish Cloak, he, um, <EM>inspected</EM> a couple of Gnomes. 
      The first was the Gnomish Spelunker found in Unrest, and the second was 
      the Gnomish Mage found in Cazic Thule. Neither Gnome had any items on them 
      after inspecting them three times.<BR><BR>Byraxis of Innoruk wrote in with 
      a new attempt using a Torn and Ripped Tunic. Byraxis' attempt may be found 
      at the bottom of this section. (<STRONG>UPDATE</STRONG>: Byraxis foudn 
      that the Torn and Ripped Tunic is given to Gnome Warriors. Byraxis tried 
      the Tunic with one and three rods with any luck. This is likely a dead 
      end).<BR><BR>Gixx Fizbane wrote in that by turing in Orc Belts to Canloe 
      Nusbeck of the Warrior's guild in Kaladim, you will receive small tattered 
      armour. In the past, Gixx has receive a small tattered cloak, but at the 
      time Gixx hadn't thought to use it for the Thermal Cloak.<BR><BR>Tynk 
      Mindrifter has given 250 bone chips to Gunlok Jure of the Paladin guild in 
      Kaladim. It was rumoured that Gunlok gave out Tattered armour. Indeed, 
      Tynk received (as well as some other items) small tattered leggings, 
      gloves, tunics, and sleeves, but so far, no small tattered 
      cloak.<BR><BR><FONT size=3>Nadiya Nightshade of Rallos Zek</FONT> has 
      suggested that medium sized cloaks be used when attempting the Thermal 
      Cloak. Nadiyra's reasoning is that most other quests that require a piece 
      of clothing use a medium sized one as the resultant magical item fits all 
      sizes.<BR><BR>Tynk Mindrifter of Mithaniel Marr has let me know that 
      Gunlock Jure in Kaladim randomly gives out small tattered cloaks as a 
      reward for turning in four bone chips. Tynk will try to confirm 
      this.<BR><BR>Brelag of Tunare wrote in with a attempt by combining a small 
      bronze splintered cloak, 2 rods and firewater. The attempt failed to 
      produce anything. I've added this information to the bottom of this 
      section.<BR><BR>A non-Gnome wrote in suggesting that the +2 INT Gnome only 
      cloak found on Innoruuk in the Plane of Hate may be the Tattered Gnomish 
      Cloak.<BR><BR>Malthus Melodius of Cazic Thule has heard that the farie 
      courtiers in Lesser Faydark may sometimes carry a Small Tattered Cloak. He 
      has hunted a few of them but has come up with nothing to date.<BR><BR>A 
      Gnome on Rodcet Nife wrote to say that within the week, someone in Oasis 
      of Marr shouted a question as to what to do with a Tattered Gnomish Cloak. 
      Perhaps it has finally been added to the world.<BR><BR>Norbert Gearsmith 
      of E'ci and other Gnomes have suggested that a belt not be used in the 
      making of a Thermal Cloak. Gimblestan always capitalized the ingredients 
      when describing how to create an item, and the belt is not 
      capitalized.<BR><BR>Norbert Gearsmith of E'ci has written in with some 
      more attempts, this time with a leather cloak. You may find this 
      information that the bottom of this section. Thanks 
      Norbert!<BR><BR>Pendrill of Rallos Zek has suggested using a material 
      other than a patchwork cloak, such as leather. This does bring up a great 
      idea of trying other fabrics, such as damask or gossimer. Earenhylle of 
      Rallos Zek (a Dark Elf) has suggested using reinforced leather armour as 
      it contains steel boning. To create it, use a large sewing kit and 
      combine: Cloak pattern, High Quality Bear/Cat/Wolf pelt, and 2 Steel 
      bonings. Thanks for the suggestions!<BR><BR>Mallv just wrote in to let me 
      know that he has tried a ruined wolf pelt, a cloak pattern, and a number 
      of rods in a medium sewing kit. So far, no luck. His list of attempts is 
      below. He'll be trying 3 rods sometime soon. Thanks Mallv!<BR><BR>Dakirn 
      of Tunare just wrote in to let me know that he has tried a small patchwork 
      cloak and a metal rod in a small sewing kit (the small sewing kit has two 
      slots) as Gimblestan mentioned sewing the rods into the cloak. 
      Unfortunately, this did not work out. He will be trying out a medium kit 
      sometime soon. Thanks Dakirn!<BR><BR>Not long after I wrote in the 
      compendium regarding Gnomad's letter, I received mail from Dakirn of 
      Tunare. He has been trying to recreate Gimblestan's work recently, and has 
      graciously passed on his list of failed attempts. I've added his list to 
      the end of Gnomad's.<BR></P></TD></TR>
