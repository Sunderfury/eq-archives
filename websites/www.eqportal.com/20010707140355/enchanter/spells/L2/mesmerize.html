    Distracted creatures will stand motionless and will not attack anyone until the effect
    wears off or they take damage.&nbsp; Affected creatures forget who was just attacking them
    and bear no grudge against anyone who already caused it damage.&nbsp; Once the spell wears
    off, aggresive monsters will return to their natural aggresive state.</td>

    <td width="607" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">Possibly the enchanter's best spell.&nbsp; With this
    spell I have managed to save more lives than I have seen clerics and shamen save (no
    offense intended, just simple fact).&nbsp; If you're the nice sort, or simply like to
    build up credit in the &quot;I saved your life&quot; department, this is an excellent
    spell to cast on monsters chasing anyone fleeing towards the nearest guards.<p>This spell
    ends after 15 seconds or until the affected being takes damage.&nbsp; This means that you
    can begin combat with this spell and, if successfully cast, you and your fellow
    spellcasters have 15 seconds to cast debuffing spells (like weakness) before it will even
    notice.</p>
    <p>If a combat begins to go poorly, this quick and effective spell can be cast and the
    monster will forget it was fighting for a time (about 15 seconds or until it takes damage)
    allowing you time to flee to safety.&nbsp; Even if the monster is naturally aggresive, if
    you can make it outside its normal attack radius it will not remember it was fighting you
    and will not come after you.&nbsp; In such an attempt to flee always remember to <em>turn
    off your autoattack feature before casting</em>.&nbsp; If you do not, you are likley to
    succeed at casting and the monster will remain neutral in dispositon to you for all of
    about 1 seconds before you clobber it with your puny weapon and it remember just why it
    was trying to rend you limb from limb. </td>
