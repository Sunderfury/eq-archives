<i>One Sponsor:</i></font><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;
We are invite only.&nbsp; A member of MoC (not in a trial period) has to
sponsor you to the Officers of MoC.&nbsp; Do not post or seek sponsors prior 
to getting approval from the officers.

<I>Officer Approval:</font></i><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; 
The MoC sponsor will propose the applicant to the guild officers 
(via posting on the MoC message board in the "New Recruits" message 
area).&nbsp; The officers will decide if we need that particular 
person, class, level at the moment. It will be a simple yes/no within 
a few days time.&nbsp; The officers will discuss the application.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;<i>Removal from the guild</font></i>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;Sad as it is, sometimes people simply cannot
get along and personalities clash, or people act in ways that are unacceptable
to guild guidelines. We don't want any boat rockers, greedy people, wingnuts, 
or people that aren't willing to help. Guild officers will decide on who 
will be removed from the guild.</font>
