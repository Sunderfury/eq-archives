<h1>New recipies on Luclin!</h1>
Downstairs in Katta Castellum, you can find a whole area modeled after AkAnon, with the trademark lava lamps and glowing walls and such.<p>
In this area, you'll find Zyleea Geerlok, who sells a book called "Geerlok's Crafty Contraptions".  From the looks of it, the recipies contained therein create items that give the user more skill in doing other tradeskills.
