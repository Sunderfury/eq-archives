<HR>Hit level 35 and am at a loss at what to solo.  My new DoT still seems to fizzle a lot and I need another level before I can really get it to work to it's maximum potential.  Thus, anything with a lot of hp such as cyclops and centaur chargers are out of the question.  Any idea of where to hunt besides south karanas?

<HR>I hear Permafrost is pretty open and it is not too far from you. If you find something called Bullsmashers hammer please post it here as anotherDruid is looking for the zone it can be acquired in.<BR>That is the only spoiler he is looking for though.

<HR>Hello people<P>As with Viserys, I am at a loss.  I have recently reached my 14th Season, and grow weary of constant assaults into Crushbone.<P>I have heard that the Minotaur Caves in Steamfont are rich (if dangerous) pickings at this point - would this be a good area to hunt?  I have also been told that the Oasis is suitable, but a little boring and short of cash...<P>Any suggestions, please?<P>------------------<BR>Layeen<BR>Druid of 14th Season<BR>Innoruuk

<HR>Here are a few suggestions for soloing at these levels..<P>35: I know what you mean, couldn't find a good spot to hunt at that level. I finally asked a more experienced druid, and she suggested shins at the Lower Guk entrance area. You may need to wait a level or two, but I found the live side a great spot for experience. Just put up thorns, DOT them, and let them beat on you awhile. And it helps if another group is there to take care of multiple frogs. The undead side is too crowded, so you may find yourself short on things to hunt there.<P>14: 14 was when I left Faydwer for the first time.. and ended up dying more times than any other level =)<BR>I initially hunted in Unrest, then shifted to the Karanas for awhile. I never really hunted in Oasis, but I've heard it's a good spot.<P>Good luck!<BR>-Torccan

<HR>Well, at 35 I heard that chasing Gnome gaurds is pretty good. At lvl 34 with 146 wizdome I tried to solo a guard but I never had the mana in the end to do that blast and I ran into problems (good thing for that esnare).<BR>But now at 35 I have 155 wiz and I think it will be easier to solo Gnomish guards and other guards easier since you can med without the book if you run out of mana in the end.<P>Hammett Ramet~Druid of the Test Server<BR>Also SK at 35 should be pretty good hunting avocets or camping that Bard. But it gets boring eventually.<P>Your best bet would be to group at LGuk. If you get a group at BR or The SR you will gain very good xp, it just needs to be a group that know what it's doing and no deaths.<P>Also in Unrest, is a good way to get xp, The Ghost room is more than good for a lvl 35 up to 37 (me thinks). Also you get good loot such as FS stuff and words or pages for your researching needs (if you are not a druid-or for a friend). Also you have a good chance to get the Dwarven Work Boots, for your self or for trade. THey are +3str +5dex and 8 ac. So you see it is benificial to many classes as for a Druid. Also the common drop the Jagged Band, which is a 5ac and 3str ring is also a good way to make money by selling it since you can get lots of them in a day of camping there. Also Unrest is an open dungeon that will allow you to use all of your spells.<P>So as you see at lvl 35 there are quite some choices you can select. And if you are a druid that hates grouping, then it's best to learn how to.<P>I don't really remember were I went at lvl 14. I think Unrest is a good place to fight at, since u get SOW and all, but it's kinda hard. A good thing is to group with a necro or a mage, since they have good pets, or even a tank, and just let the tank get the damage and you heal and DS.<P>Also I heard that at 14, lavastorm is a good place fight because of the elementals. And since a druid at 14 gets levitate and a DD against Summoned stuff such elementals, it's a good place to fight.<P>Well I hope I have been usefull

<HR>Lvl 14 go to Oasis-it's great experience and super way to learn open space kiting techniques. Then at lvl 19 buy your tp spells and head by boat to Overthere. You can bind on the WarWoods zone line and solo there until about lvl 24. Gate back and forth to sell, buy, and bank. At lvl 24 go to WarWoods and do giants or go to Lake of Ill Omen. You can solo giants in WarWoods or solo at the Lake. I recommend however that you group at Lake at least part of the time. It is very important at this point to learn good grouping techniques for future use. <P>At lvl 30 go to Frontier Mts for a few lvls or go to Iceclad where you can solo or group. You can stay there for several lvls or go back to Overthere at lvl 30 and group, I don't recommend solo at that time because experience is so slow and with a group it is so much better. For example I did my first "Hell level 30" at sarnak fort in Lake of Ill Omen in just one afternoon. Not bad! Now at lvl 40 with my Monk husband lvl 41,we are in Emerald Jungle off and on with a small group-seems it might be one of the "bonus experience" zones. Loot isn't great but experience is! We also spend part of our time in Rathe Mts doing giants there-loot is fantastic!<P>And for our lvl 6 druid-go to Freeport! Hunt in the commons, EC to start with and NRo has stuff also or go to Misty Thicket which is very good until about lvl 10 then go hunt wisps. You can easily run to RV as long as you stay on the wall of Kith and go in daylight!<P>Hope I have been of some help to you and good luck-solo is great but a good group can be magic!<BR>
