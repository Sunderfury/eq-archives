<font SIZE="4" COLOR="#000000">
<p>Today we find our heroes meeting for what I think is the first time in
person.</p>
<p>After talking many times together on the EQ Psychic Guild Hotline, they meet
in West Commons.&nbsp; This turns out to be a heroing journey for Traves who is killed
by the scourge of West Commons, the dastardly dark elf, Gix, during his first
attempt at meeting. His determination is such though, that he
makes the journey yet again to meet with Rash.</p>
<p>With the meeting of the two finally taking place, Rash helps the poor Traves
with his corpse. Badly decayed, the corpse is able to be found and the items
recovered.</p>
<p>Rash, the Paladin &amp; Traves, the Bard then set out on the perilous journey
to Upper Guk. Even more perilous because neither of the two has ever been there.
In their journey to find Upper Guk in hopes of finding mythical treasures and better
armor...Rash had heard the rumors while sitting in a bar from a neighboring
table.</p>
<p>Traves started up his SOW song &amp; they set off... weaving and bobbing
around the troublesome creatures as they went looking for this place called Guk.</p>
<p>Traves is attacked by a puma &amp; young kodiak....Rash helps immensely by
slashing at the beasts.&nbsp; They make it through the attack with Traves
healing the pair with his songs as they fight off the attacking animals.</p>
<p>Soon after they become aware of a ghoul nearby.&nbsp; Traves has some
trepidation about attacking such a creature but Rash thinks we can dispatch the
creature.&nbsp; Rash strikes and the vile beast retaliates.&nbsp; In this
fateful moment Traves finds out about the magical nature of this creature as his
sword bounces off the ghoul...invulnerable hit!&nbsp; Ack!&nbsp; This creature
is beyond us!&nbsp; Traves quickly switches to his acceleration song to allow a
quick escape from a surely perilous confrontation.</p>
<p>We think we're safe and Traves begins his healing song but then...the ghoul
just won't stop coming!&nbsp; Rashkar tries some fear undead spells to no
avail!&nbsp; Traves sings his song to allow us to escape quickly.&nbsp;
RRRRUUUUNNNN!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; A wizard in the distance...if we can make it maybe
he can help.&nbsp; A flash of light and a crack of thunder later the ghoul has
fallen and a nameless wizard is triumphant!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battling duo reaffirm their commitment to find their Guk destination when
they spy a hill giant.&nbsp; They both marvel at the sheer immensity of the
giant (Rash is even more in wonder, having
never seen such a being before) They consider the hill giant and both see
red.&nbsp; The hill giant passes by and seems to be headed into the distance.</p>
<p>Seeing the hill giant and knowing it is not something to encourage a fight
with, the poor souls take refuge with some other resting
adventurers in a small hut not to far from the scouting Hill Giant (whom is closer than
either of them suspect!) Now as the two check out the goods of the local merchant
inside the hut, they are dumbfounded when the roof of the hut is torn asunder
and a Hill Giant peeks through and attacks with a furiousity one can only
imagine!</p>
<p>After a mad scramble for the door, and a little bumping into each other as
the door begins to open we find our
heroes dead by the mighty blows of the giant.</p>
<p>As the final breaths leave the adventurers they find themselves reborn.&nbsp;
Rashkar finds himself back in Butcherblock whilst Traves is teleported back to
Riverdale.&nbsp; Alas, the adventures were not meant to find Upper Guk on this
day.&nbsp; Perhaps another day and another set of truly amazing adventures...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some final thoughts:</p>
<p>1) Get a bind no matter what if you are adventuring far from home.</p>
<p>2) Don't think a hut will protect you from ANYTHING.</p>
<p>3) Giants &amp; other monsters have xray vision and can spot you in buildings
and also have an uncanny ability to walk through hut walls!.</p>
<p>4) Ghouls can be nasty things to deal with when magical weapons and/or
damaging spells aren't available. </p>
