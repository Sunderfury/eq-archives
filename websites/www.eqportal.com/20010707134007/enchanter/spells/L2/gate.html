    <td width="608" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" height="323">One of the early joys of being
    a spellcaster.&nbsp; You can explore without fear of getting truly lost once you have this
    spell.&nbsp; If you get overburdened with gear and are moving at a slow crawl, you can
    gate home and you are already that much closer to selling off excess gear.&nbsp; Later on,
    when you get <a href="../L4/bind%20affinity.html" target="_self">Bind Affinity</a>, you
    can even set your bind point directly to a key location, such as a shop to sell gear, a
    tavern for that quick drink after a tough fight, or just near the actual location you'll
    be working in case a mishap causes you to need to seek out your corpse.<p>The casting time
    on this spell, as well as the comparatively high mana cast early on, makes this a spell
    you'll not be able to use frequently in mid-combat.&nbsp; At least, this is what I've
    heard and been told many times.&nbsp; Granted, this is true if you're being beaten on by
    some disgruntled monster, however, being an enchanter means having more options at that
    critical point.&nbsp; All it takes is a single, successful <a href="mesmerize.html"
    target="_self">mesmerize</a> spell to buy you the time to gate, provided you have the mana
    for it.&nbsp; Failing that, I have successfully gated out of combat a few times even while
    being the unhappy target for someone elses aggression.</p>
    <p>Gate will carry you across zone borders back to your bind point, however, if you are
    gating within the same zone the affect is nearly instantaneous.</td>
