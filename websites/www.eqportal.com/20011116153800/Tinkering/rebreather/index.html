Have you ever wanted to make a rebreather, but didn't know how?  Well, here's my guide to making these super expensive, super heavy, super money makers!
<p>
Many people have said that rebreathers are too heavy, why are they "giant" items, etc etc...  A little web search told me why.  Here's <a href=http://www.metacut.com/rebreathers/ccr2000_400fsw.htm>a page about a REAL rebreather</a>.  As you can see, it's much much more than just a mask like the icon shows.  It's a whole mask/backpack/air scrubber thing.  It really IS big!<p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 1: Charisma is a good thing</h2>
The first thing you have to do is work on getting your charisma up.  Face it, gnomes are not the prettiest things in the world (except to other gnomes), and your charisma is probably around 60, unless you're an enchanter.
<p>
Get yourself the following jewelery and stick them in a bag for use when buying the VERY expensive components in the rebreather:

<table border=2 bordercolor=#400000>

<tr><td>Cats-eye Agate<td>Velium<td>Neck<td>+10</tr>
<tr><td>Cats-eye Agate<td>Gold<td>Wrist<td>+7</tr>
<tr><td>Cats-eye Agate<td>Gold<td>Wrist<td>+7</tr>

<tr><td><td><td><b>TOTAL</b><td><b>+48</b></tr></table>

<p>
Those six items will get your charisma above 100, which is CRUCIAL for getting the best prices from the various merchants you'll be dealing with, and therefore more profit when you sell your finished rebreathers.
<p>

<h2>Step 2: Know your zones!</h2>
If you're a wizard, I suggest getting to level 19, so you can port yourself to Greater Faydark, and bind in the windmill where Bom Knotwood lives. If not, simply follow this map to get around.  You'll be travelling between N. Felwithe and Ak`Anon, and finishing up in the third windmill to do most of your work.
<p>
This map shows all of the zones you'll be visiting, and the major landmarks. The maps are from <a href=http://www.eqatlas.com target=_new>EQAtlas.com</a>.  I urge you to make a donation to the Muse's site, so he can keep making his wonderful maps!<p>

<h2>Step 3: Know your merchants!</h2>
Here are all the merchants you'll be visiting, their locations, and what they sell. Also noted are the items that you'll be buying from them, and what those items are used for.<p>

<h3>Merchant Irontree</h3>
This guy is a real shady character.  His best price for helms is around 165, but You have to have great faction, AND great charisma to get that price.  I normally pay around 400pp because I'm apprehensive to him. Pick up a helm (in gold) and move on to the back of Felwithe, to get fish and water.<p>
<img src=irontree.jpg>
<p>
<h3>Fishmonger Issa</h3>
She's a nice gal, but she smells funny.  Buy a stack or two of fish. (It counts as a meal, so you will probably eat some of it before you get around to using it. Better to buy too many fish than to not buy enough.)  Also, she's a good one to buy water from, since you're already there.  Again, buy too many waters. In case you didn't know, holding the shift key while clicking "buy" will purchase an entire stack.<p>
<img src=fishmonger.jpg>
<p>
<h3>a clockwork barkeep</h3>
Make your way to Ak'Anon.  In the bank complex, you'll find a couple ticking barkeeps.  Buy a stack of Gnomish Spirits. Some to use in the creation of firewater, and some to drink after you've made your first rebreather!  Remember, shift-buy is your friend!<p>
<img src=barkeep.jpg>
<p>
<h3>Bom Knotwood</h3>
OK, you've gotten all the stuff you need from everywhere else, now you're ready to start combining things. Bom is a good guy, and more than happy to take all of your money.  As you can see, you'll be buying a LOT of items from him.  They range from a few silver to over 150 platinum each!  This is one place that you don't want to shift-buy. Holding Ctrl while clicking buy will get you one item at a time without the scroll bar.  Use it when buying components for the aqualung (in the pink).<p>
<img src=bom.jpg>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 4: Some assembly required!</h2>
OK, let's take stock of what you have on you, what you're wearing, and how much money you'll actually be spending.<p>
You're wearing your charisma gear, so your int/wis is low. You'll fix that once you buy everything. You want the best prices possible!<p>
In one bag, you have water, gnomish spirits, and fish. You have an empty toolbox, and perhaps another toolbox or a bag of the tinkerers to put your finished aqualungs and rebreathers in. (They need a giant container, remember.)<p>
You have at least one platemail helm, and maybe a few, if you want to try a few times. You have 700pp per rebreather that you plan on attempting on you. If you want to make four tries, at this point you should have four platemail helms, and 2800pp.<p>
Follow these simple steps to create the two basic parts, and then the rebreather itself...<p>
<h3>Making the Aqualung</h3>
<img src=makeaqualung.jpg><img src=makeaqualung2.jpg align=top><p>
Once you buy all the things shown here and put them in the toolbox, take a moment to put your int/wis gear on, so it's back up where it should be. You want that extra chance for a skillraise, don't you?<p>
When you click combine, you should either see "You fail to combine these items to make something new" and everything will poof, or You'll successfuly combine them, and maybe even gain a skill point! Put the aqualung in your second toolbox or other giant bag. You'll get it out later. <p>
You can sell these for five or six hundred, and accept them for 400 off the cost of a rebreather if you want.  It doesn't matter how many charges the aqualung has when it's combined later.  Some people would rather just use the aqualung, and that's fine... as long as they know that the breath of the dead can be dispelled, which can lead to drowning in places like Kedge Keep. The effect on the rebreather is permanant, and can never be removed, as long as you're wearing it.<p>
The aqualung goes trivial at 148.  If you are not quite there yet and have some cash, you should make a whole bunch of aqualungs and store them until they are trivial.  At that point, you can go back and turn them into rebreathers, and have a better chance of success, and a better chance of gaining skill.<p>
Nevermind-- I know you're going to ignore that advice, so let's move along to making firewater.<p>
<h3>Making the Firewater</h3>
It's trivial to begin with, so there's not much concern here. It's a very easy recipe, too.<p>
This is used in a lot of recipes, so get used to it.<p>
<img src=makefirewater.jpg><img src=makefirewater2.jpg align=top><p>
Chances are very good that this was successful.  If not, curse at the Random Number Generator for a minute, and try again. Next stop, putting it all together!<p>
<h3>Making the Rebreather</h3>
You're almost there!  Just one combine left, and then you have a real money maker... or you have an empty cursor and 900pp gone. Put your charisma gear back on before buying the components you need here.  Prices range from 17pp to 156pp on these last 3 things.  Put the Platemail helm, the firewater, and the aqualung in your toolbox, and buy the other three items from Bom.  Put your int/wis gear on again, pray to Bristlebane, and click combine.<p>
<img src=makerebreather.jpg><img src=makerebreather2.jpg align=top><p>
Congradulations, you may already be a winner!  If you made the rebreather, put it in another bag, and go for a second one.  Don't forget to swap out your charisma and int/wis gear when you need to!<p>
