                <p>The City State of Ak'Anon is the Capital of
                the Kingdom of Ak'Anon. The Royal Palace and all
                of the guild halls reside here. The Royal
                Observatory headed by Fodin Frugrin, located just
                outside the entrance to Ak'Anon, is considered a
                part of the city.<br>
                <br>
                The Capital is known for the many clockwork
                creations that fill all corridors. The clockworks
                work in a variety of roles, including that of
                guard, merchant, cleaner, and sweeper. You'll
                also find many a Gnome working as a mechanic
                (under the direction of the Order of Engineers)
                tending to the various machinery that keep the
                city running. Other locations of note is the
                great Library, which houses the sum of Gnome
                knowledge, and the renowned Ak'Anon Zoo.<br>
                <br>
                The City of Ak'Anon is made up of Gnomes from all
                walks of life: from scholars to Tinkers, warriors
                to clerics, merchants to adventurers. And while
                much of the city is safely traveled thanks to the
                clockwork guards, most residents would warn of
                the lower depths around the abandoned mines and
                scrap yard.<br>
                <br>
                The city is also home to the last postal stop of
                Faydwer. Once a week, mail for the provinces and
                territories is placed within the Cargo Clockwork
                at the Royal Observatory. From there it is
                delivered to the Windmills of Upper Steamfont.
                Residents of the two Provinces and Lesser Faydark
                Territory may then travel to the Windmills to
                retrieve their mail without requiring a trip to
                the Capital.<br>

                <p>Upper Steamfont Province is the wealthiest
                region outside of the Capital City. The great
                market place just beyond the entrance to the
                underground city falls within this region's
                jurisdiction.<br>
                <br>
                The observatory located east of the market place,
                headed by Phiz Frugrin, is second only to the
                Royal Observatory. The observatory makes up the
                main complex of the University of Upper
                Steamfont. The University is also known for its
                archeological dig of the great dragon bones.<br>
                <br>
                By far the most prominent structures are the
                great Windmills. Managing to pick up even the
                slightest breeze, there are no other structures
                like them in Norrath. They are maintained in a
                joint effort between the Ak'Anon Order of
                Engineers and the Eldrich Collective. The
                Windmills also house the Tinkering branch of the
                University of Upper Steamfont, where apprentices
                help out with the daily Windmill maintenance.<br>
                <br>
                Most Gnomes that live within the Upper Steamfont
                Province are merchants or Tinkers, many of them
                quite wealthy. The region surrounding the
                University is always bustling with students.<br>

                <p>Many consider the Lower Steamfont Province to
                be more rural than it's more populate neighbour.
                Life here is generally slower and more relaxed.
                The main attraction is the observatory that is
                headed by Tindo Frugrin.<br>
                <br>
                Many Gnomes that live in Lower Steamfont tend the
                land to produce a variety of grains. Lower
                Steamfont is also a popular vacationing area for
                Gnomes that want to leave the hustle and bustle
                of their everyday lives for the serenity of the
                plains and foothills. Some of the wealthier
                Gnomes own cottages here.<br>
                <br>
                The distance of the province from the Capital
                does have its downsides. For one, the Watchmen
                rarely make patrols through the region. Sometimes
                the Kobolds raid the farms for goods, and the
                occasional wild puma wanders through populated
                areas.<br>
                <br>
                Some of the younger Gnomes tend to leave Lower
                Steamfont to attend university in Upper Steamfont
                (when they can afford it), or, for the more
                fortunate ones, to apprentice at one of the
                guildhalls in the Capital. The observatory also
                acts as a college for those that cannot afford
                the more expensive universities.<br>

                <p>The newest of the Kingdom of Ak'Anon regions
                on the continent of Faydwer, the Lesser Faydark
                Territory is a wild place, filled with large
                beasts and bandits. Few Gnomes call the territory
                home. Most that do work at or help in the
                construction of the observatory headed by Trudo
                Frugrin.<br>
                <br>
                The territory was born when a large passageway
                was discovered through the Steamfont Mountains.
                There have always been smaller passageways, but
                none the size of this. Once Gnome miners widened
                the entrance (using controlled amounts of
                Firewater), it was possible to move building
                supplies and trading carts through. Construction
                of the ever-important observatory began, and
                treaties were formed with the two other races
                that call the Lesser Faydark home: the Brownies
                and the Faeries.<br>
                <br>
                Some of the other races in the Lesser Faydark
                have opposed the construction of the observatory
                feeling that it will be used to spy on them. So
                far, this has not slowed its construction
                (although the reported over spending may). To
                help alleviate these concerns, people from all
                over Faydwer are invited to spend some time at
                the observatory. It is the only observatory where
                the visitor has complete access (other
                observatories have restricted access).<br>

                <p>Following the closing of the mines within the
                City of Ak'Anon, another source of ore and gems
                was required. While the Dwarves were willing to
                trade for their mine's output, the Kingdom of
                Ak'Anon required its own internal supply. Captain
                Bipnupple was dispatched to find that supply.<br>
                <br>
                His search took him to the Lavastorm Mountains.
                He discovered an entrance to a dual cave system
                that became known as Solusek's Eyes. Discovering
                that the caves had enough ore and gems for the
                Kingdom but were already inhabited by a Goblin
                clan, a treaty was struck. Word was sent back to
                the City of Ak'Anon regarding the discovery, and
                supplies and miners were dispatched to the newly
                declared colony.<br>
                <br>
                Not long after construction of the colony began,
                the Goblins violated the treaty and declared the
                Gnome excavated regions their own. Captain
                Bipnupple ordered the construction of a fort to
                protect the Gnome miners while they work. Tinkers
                were also instructed to lay traps in passageways
                leading to the fort to deter Goblin raids.<br>
                <br>
                Most Gnomes that live in the colony are either
                miners or Tinkers (that work at the creation of
                clockwork guards), with the majority dedicating
                their time to mining. It is hot work excavating
                near the lava pits, but most are not deterred,
                with the prospect of the riches at hand.<br>
                <br>
                Other Gnomes make their livelihood through the
                transportation of ore and gems back to the
                Capital. <br>
