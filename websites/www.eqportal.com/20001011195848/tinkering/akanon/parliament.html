                representatives (including the Prime Regent)

                debating topics of the day and questioning the
                Executive. The main exception is that they are
                not involved in matters of taxation and finance.
                The role of the Lords is generally recognized to
                be complementary to that of the Synod and it acts
                as a revising chamber for many of the more
                important and controversial bills. <br>
                <br>
                The House of Lords has members representing each
                of the following groups:<br>

                <p>A member of the House of Lords has a privilege
                of title, such as: Lord Fulcrum of the Ak'Anon
                Order of Engineers [used purely as an example :)
                ]<br>
                <br>
                Each member of the House of Lords represents the
                group of citizens that consider themselves under
                the Lord's title. If a non-guild Lord belongs to
                a Guild, the Lord must act in the best interest
                of the Lord's position and not the Guild. For
                example, the Lord of the Gemchoppers may belong
                to another guild, but while attending to the
                duties of Parliament, the Lord must shed all
                allegiances to the guild and focus on the
                Lord&#146;s designated duties.<br>
                <br>
                If it is deemed that the Lord has not been able
                to focus on their position, then the Lord may be
                removed from the House. All Guild titles must be
                hidden unless the member is directly representing
                a Guild.<br>
                <br>
                Each member is either appointed (in the case of
                Guilds) or elected by members of the group from
                which the member will represent. If only a single
                citizen is interested in the position, then an
                election need not be held. Every member holds the
                position for life, or until retirement,
                resignation, or has been removed by impeachment.
                If a position becomes vacant, the members of the
                House determine which member will fill the
                vacancy until either appointment or election
                fills it.<br>

                <td colspan="2">The Speaker acts as a Chairman
                during debates, and sees that the rules laid down
                by the House for the carrying on of its business
                are observed. It is the Speaker who selects (or
                calls) Members to speak. He or she acts as the
                House&#146;s representative in its relations with
                outside bodies and the other elements of
                Parliament and the Crown. It is also the Speaker
                who reprimands on behalf of the House an offender
                brought to the Bar. The Speaker is also
                responsible for protecting the interests of
                minorities in the House.<br>
                <br>
                It is obviously essential that debates should be
                conducted in an orderly way, and unlikely that
                the course of debate would flow smoothly if there
                were not some way of regulating who was to speak.
                The selection of those who are to speak is
                therefore a very important one for the Chair, and
                one that has to be handled with tact and
                discretion. In a debate, official spokesmen for
                both sides take part, as well as those Members
                with constituency interests, those who specialize
                in the subject under discussion and those simply
                with a general interest. The Speaker, therefore,
                has to balance all these requirements when
                working out who should be called. Members may
                press their claims for being called in advance of
                particular debates, but the decision rests solely
                with the Speaker.<br>
                <br>
                The Speaker must preserve order in the House, and
                ensure that its rules of debate are observed. For
                instance, a Member who makes an allegation
                against another, or expresses himself in language
                that the rules do not permit, may be directed to
                withdraw the remark concerned. In the case of
                grave general disorder, the sitting may have to
                be suspended. In the case of willful disobedience
                by one or more particular Members the Speaker can
                name him or them, which will result in their
                suspension - for a period - from the House.<br>
                <br>
                The Speaker has to protect the rights of
                minorities in the House. He or she must ensure
                that the holders of an opinion, however
                unpopular, are allowed to put across their point
                of view without undue obstruction. This is
                especially important when deciding whether or not
                to allow the closure to be moved - that is,
                whether a debate can be brought to a close. If
                minorities have not been able to make a
                contribution, this will weigh with the Speaker in
                assessing whether the closure may be moved.<br>
                <br>
                The Speaker must, of course, be above political
                controversy and must be seen to be completely
                impartial in all public matters. All sides in the
                House rely on the Speaker's disinterest and
                respect that he or she must stand aside from
                controversy.<br>
                <br>
                The Speaker is also responsible for recording the
                events that occur while in the House is in
                session, either personally or by appointing a
                clerk.<br>
                <br>
                The King is by right the Speaker of both the
                Synod and the House of Lords. However, it is rare
                that the King exercises this right. Therefore,
                both the Synod and the House of Lords may appoint
                their Speaker. The Speaker of the Synod and the
                Speaker of the House of Lords may be the same
                individual, or may be distinct. In either case,
                the Speaker then chooses two deputies (upon
                approval of the House), who may stand-in on
                occasion for the Speaker, and at least one should
                be present with the Speaker while the House is in
                session as council.<br>

                <p>The most important privilege is that of
                freedom of speech. As members of Parliament
                cannot be prosecuted for sedition or charged with
                libel or slander over anything said during
                proceedings in the House, this enables them to
                raise in the House questions affecting the public
                good which might be difficult to raise outside
                owing to the possibility of being charged.<br>
                <br>
                Parliament has the right to punish anybody,
                inside or outside of the House, who commits a
                breach of privilege - that is, offends against
                the rights of Parliament. A Member of Parliament
                complaining of an alleged breach of privilege
                must submit the case privately to the Speaker,
                who then decides whether the matter can be raised
                in the Chamber itself. If the Speaker rules in
                Parliament that a case appears to have been
                established, the matter takes precedence over all
                other business. If, when summoned an offender
                admits the offence but offers a full apology, the
                Speaker often recommends that it be accepted. The
                House then considers the Speaker's report and
                decides whether or not the offender should be
                punished.<br>
                <br>
                Parliament also claims the right to punish
                'contempt' of the House - that is, any offence or
                libel against its dignity or authority. An
                offending MP may be reprimanded, suspended, or in
                extreme cases, expelled from the House. Offenders
                who are not MPs are brought to the House by the
                Watchman of the House - one of the officers of
                the House - where they are reprimanded by the
                Speaker.<br>

                the appropriate time to query the Member for the
                requested action. When the Speaker has given a
                Member permission to speak, the Member (and only
                the permitted Member) will hold a lit Torch. When
                the Member has finished his or her speech, or the
                Speaker has asked the Member to stop, the Member
                will put the Torch away.<br>
