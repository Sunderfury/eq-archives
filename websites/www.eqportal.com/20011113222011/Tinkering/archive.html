      <p>Greetings Everyone.</p>
      <p>As many of you know, Fulcrum is currently MIA. Since that is the case, 
        I am here to take over the tinkering Compendium. I am Dakirn Wigglesnout, 
        Gnome Warrior extrordinare of the Tunare server. Some of you may already 
        know me, some of you do not, but I'm going to do my best to keep this 
        site going.</p>
      <p>You'll notice quite a few changes over the next few weeks. I plan to 
        change the website a little to make it prettier. If you anyone has suggestions 
        for the site, please feel free to e-mail me at <a href=mailto:dakirn@tinkering.org>dakirn@tinkering.org.</a></p>
      <p>Also, I have registered the domain name <a href=http://www.tinkering.org>www.tinkering.org</a> 
        to make it easier for some people to access the site. Since there is a 
        tinkering upgrade planned for around the time of the Velious expansion, 
        I figured that it'd be easier for people to remember that way =)</p>
      <p>The forums will be staying the same, I like them and didn't want to touch 
        'em.</p>
      <p>Change is not always painless, but hopefully we'll be able to pull together 
        as a community to make this new site the premiere tinkering information 
        on the internet!</p>

    <td>Greetings All! It has been far too long since I was last able to update 
      the Compendium. My recent schedule has made it difficult to maintain the 
      Compendium, but I believe this is about to change. I just wanted to let 
      you all know that I'm still here, and I will make an effort to update the 
      Compendium in the next few days. There are quite a lot of you that are waiting 
      to be added to the GPS, so this will be the first section to receive an 
      update.<br>
      <br>
      I would also like to announce that <strong>Knok Verst of Karana</strong> 
      has agreed to help out with the organization of the Community Recipes for 
      the purpose of sending them onto the gods of Norrath. Hopefully we'll see 
      some of them in the upcoming Tinkering upgrade. In the next day or so, Knok 
      will be made the moderator of the Workbench Tinkering Forum to allow him 
      to organize all of our thoughts. I will still be involved in the overall 
      project (there are other issues besides more recipes). With Knok's help, 
      we should be able to get everything back on track.</td>

      <p>I received an interesting letter from a Guide that wanted to let us all

                <br>
                I am neither a tinkerer, nor a gnome; but I am a Guide who took 
                part in the second Kunark kick-off event which occurred in Everfrost, 
                and included the Personal Heater. I write to you, to hopefully 
                save many honorable Tinkerers from wasting their valuable time 
                and talents on attempting to re-create the &quot;personal heater&quot; 
                item.<br>
                <br>
                The Personal Heater was simply a lantern. Nothing more. It's effect 
                was created by the verant GM playing it's role. The loot left 
                after it's destruction was random and created by each GM at his 
                or her discretion.<br>
                <br>
                While the attempt to re-create this item speaks volumes about 
                the ingenuity and perseverance of the Gnomish community as a whole, 
                it is a fruitless one.<br>
                <br>
                You will forgive me if I ask you to withhold my email address, 
                for obvious reasons.<br>

      <p>I cannot confirm the authenticity of the letter, but it does sound reasonable 
        and does confirm what a few Gnomes have been thinking. This goes under 
        the category of &quot;It would have been nice...&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Tinkerten Iktomi of Solusek Ro wrote in with information of a Lens of 
        Sorts found in Cabilis. I've added it to the <a href="curios.html">Curios</a> 
        section as it does sound somewhat Gnomish and Tinker-like. Tinkerten will 
        cast Identify on it sometime in the near future and will write back to 
        let us all known the results. If anyone knows more about this item, please 
        write in.<br>

    <td>Greetings! Things have been slow here at the Compendium, which is perhaps 
      best for the moment. I'm concerned that I am stretching myself a little 
      thin these days between the Compendium, the <a

      I've been a little neglectful in keeping up with the Tinkering Forums, and 
      I do apologize. Right now there is some great talk at <a
        href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/ffulcrumstinkeringforumstheworkbench">The 
      Workbench</a> about what recipes you'd like to see in the upcoming upgrade

      have your say.<br>
      <br>
      As usual, the <a href="locator.html">GPS</a> has again expanded. Be sure 
      to check it out. Anyone who has sent in their information up to today should 
      now be included.<br>

                to <br>
                post.&nbsp; There was a GM event in Everfrost last night were 
                a gnome <br>
                showed off a new 'invention'.&nbsp; It was a floating lantern 
                called a <br>
                personal heater.&nbsp; (Actually, it was a shadow man holding 
                a lamp, <br>
                renamed to 'a personal heater').&nbsp; Anyways, the lamp had some 
                cool <br>
                effects, casting fireshield on everyone around it (then it started 
                <br>
                doing an AOE that affected all pc's too close).&nbsp; The gnomes 
                decided <br>
                it must be destroyed, because the creator used the wrong items 
                in <br>
                it's making.&nbsp; Anyways, the players around slaughtered the 
                personal <br>
                heater, and both members in my group managed to loot/inspect the 
                <br>
                items on the corpse.&nbsp; The following is the log from what 
                they <br>
                reported:<br>
                <br>
                [Wed Apr 19 20:11:58 2000] Calador tells the group, 'wiz spell,

                [Wed Apr 19 20:12:07 2000] Calador tells the group, 'metal twine'<br>
                [Wed Apr 19 20:12:11 2000] Calador tells the group, 'metal rod'<br>
                [Wed Apr 19 20:12:22 2000] Calador tells the group, 'and gizmo 
                #6'<br>
                [Wed Apr 19 20:14:07 2000] Ursoo tells the guild, 'gears, amber, 
                <br>
                large lantern, metal parts'<br>
                <br>
                Now the gnomes argued over the fact that they 'should have' used 
                <br>
                gizmo #4 to keep the item from being dangerous.&nbsp; Plus, I 
                think Ursoo <br>
                was refering to metal bits, not metal parts.. but I dont know 
                for <br>
                sure, since Dark Elves don't meddle much into tinkering.<br>
                <br>

    <td>Greetings everyone! Well, it has been a busy week for me, and I've only 
      just now had a chance to update the Compendium. There's a lot to talk about, 
      so let's get started.<br>
      <br>
      First off, a lot more Gnomes have been added to the <a
        href="locator.html">GPS</a>. It's great to see so many names up there, 
      but it would also be great if more of you registered. Even if you are not 
      Tinkering at the moment, it's always good to see how many Gnomes are out 
      there. I've decided to add my own name to the list even though I rarely 
      have time to Tinker items for others (heck, I rarely have time to Tinker 
      items for myself.). One note about the GPS: I will not put actual prices 
      into this section. I would not be able to keep up with the mail that this 
      would generate as Gnomes lower their prices to compete with others, nor 
      would I want this section to become bogged down with price wars.<br>
      <br>
      Not too long ago I reported that I had heard that the Rebreather might not 
      need to be placed on the head to work. Well, Knok Verst of Karana has written 
      in to state that Rebreathers do still need to be placed on the head to work.<br>
      <br>
      Muddletupper of Mithaniel Marr has written in with some news on the Metal 
      Disk in the <a href="curios.html">Gnomish Curios</a> section. Check out 
      the page for the details.<br>
      <br>
      Xila Cloudweaver wrote in to let us know that Gnomish Spirits may also be 
      brewed. I've updated the <a
        href="ingredients.html">Ingredients</a> section with this information.<br>
      <br>
      Salastil of Tallon Zek has petitioned a GM regarding Kozyn not providing 
      information on Big Bynn. Salastil has been told that this is currently not 
      working, and should be fixed soon.<br>
      <br>
      Two new Gemcutter suggestions have come in. The first is from Filitin, who 
      suggests that someone should cast identify on a Gemcutter. Sounds like a 
      good idea. Filitin also suggest that the Gemcutter be used on a piece of 
      glass from a pottery merchant. The second suggestion comes from Xyntress 
      of The Rathe who suggests that the Gemcutter is used to add gems to clothing. 
      Perhaps this would allow tailors to create magically enhanced clothing? 
      I've added both suggestions to the <a
        href="cutter.html">Gemcutter</a> section.<br>

              <p><em>To: The Illustrious Guild of Tinkers and Inventors, Ak'anon 
                Chapter<br>
                From: Omnipotus<br>
                Subject: The Fall of Gear Norther<br>
                <br>
                It is with a heavy heart that I must report the most recent accident 
                regarding the Tinkers and the trials we underwent to restore one 
                gnome's hope for the future.<br>
                <br>
                It began with a frantic cry coming from the windmills of our beloved 
                Steamfont, as one of our number ran about, seemingly lost, begging 
                for help. His name was Fringle Doon and he was in the midst of 
                completing his greatest creation: a device which would eliminate 
                all hunger from the world. Somehow, though, a foul thief broke 
                into his laboratory and stole the last of the components!<br>
                <br>
                Desperately, Fringle begged us to track down the thief, a halfling 
                by the name of Meepenny. Calling upon the impressive forces of 
                those who had gathered at the windmills, we were magically transported 
                to the Misty Thicket, where the hunt for the dastardly rogue began. 
                While I myself am of this illustrious profession, I must say I 
                found myself driven to track her down and retrieve her ill-gotten 
                gains in the interest of furthering the ways of the tinker.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, we found her, and she was dispatched with brutal efficiency. 
                Once more, Eldritch winds transported us back to Steamfont, where 
                we raced back to the windmills with the stolen parts.<br>
                <br>
                When we arrived, we found Fringle along with his creation, called 
                Gear Norther. Although it resembled the clockworks that roam Steamfont, 
                this one was quite docile..at first. Hurriedly, Fringle completed 
                the last bits of work, and a collective cheer rose from the group. 
                Gear Norther began to move from person to person, distributing 
                food to each of us. Truly a wondrous creation!!<br>
                <br>
                During the theft, however, Meepenny must have done something to 
                damage the delicate parts, because suddenly a horrid screeching 
                arose from Gear Norther and it began to shake fiercely. Suddenly, 
                it turned and attacked one of our companions!! It was trying to 
                turn him into food!! <br>
                <br>
                With a heavy heart, we drew our blades and lunged into the foray, 
                beating the creation with every ounce of strength. Ultimately, 
                the clockwork fell to our blows, and Fringle's sobs were heard 
                throughout Steamfont. We sought to comfort him in this time of 
                need, and he thanked us for our help, gifting each of us with 
                some gold he had gathered together during his travels.<br>
                <br>
                Each of us turned and headed back to our homes, and I could not 
                help but wonder if my tinkering career might meet such an ignoble 
                fate. Can the path of the rogue and that of the tinker co-exist? 
                Must they clash against one another, leaving only death and destruction 
                in their wake?<br>
                <br>
                Surely there must be another way...</em></p>

      King Ak'Anon and the T.B.I.</strong></font></td>

  <tr> 
    <td>Greetings all! Some interesting news today...<br>
      <br>
      To begin with, it would appear that King Ak'Anon is actually a clockwork! 
      Grouchie Grumbles of Solusek Ro wrote in yesterday (as have others since, 
      and it has also been discussed at the Ak'Anon Bar) that he was called in 
      front of the King two days ago to discover that the King is no longer using 
      his human illusion. There is now a clockwork claiming to be King Ak'Anon 
      himself.<br>
      <br>
      Now, I do not know what the rest of you think about this, but I am concerned. 
      While I embrace my Tinker heritage, there have been times when I wander 
      the corridors of Ak'Anon that I ponder who is really the master of our great 
      society. We created the clockworks to help out with our common day-to-day 
      tasks such as cleaning, policing and commerce. Their creation has allowed 
      Gnomes to focus on more intellectual pursuits. However, have we come to 
      rely on them to such a great extent that without them we would no longer 
      be able to function as a society? Have we become a slave to our own inventions?<br>
      <br>
      Now, with a clockwork in a position that we have all sworn loyalty to, I 
      can only hope that this incarnation is only temporary and that our flesh 
      and blood King will return. Perhaps the King currently fears for his life 
      and has put a duplicate in his place to draw out the attacker? Only time 
      will tell.<br>
      <br>
      On to other possibly disturbing news. Babaaeyen of Povar wrote in yesterday 
      (and others have discussed this at the Ak'Anon Bar) regarding a discussion 
      with a fellow Gnome by the name of Kozyn Gigglephizz. Kozyn was apparently 
      looking for any Tinmizer's Fabulous Compactors that may have been handed 
      out by Sanfyrd at the scrapyard, and was offering a reward. Babaaeyen also 
      mentioned that Kozyn was a part of the T.B.I., a group that I had not heard 
      of. Given this information, and the fact that I own a Compactor, I headed 
      off in search of Kozyn. Unfortunately, I was not able to find him (Babaaeyen 
      mentioned that Kozyn is usually found in the little room next to the exit 
      from Ak'Anon). I decided to go have a chat with Sanfyrd regarding the whole 
      situation, and this is what transpired:<br>

                </em><em><strong>Sanfyrd Featherhead is frightened by your inquiry. 
                I cannot speak of it. I can tell you to seek a gnome in Ak'Anon 
                named Kozyn. That is all. Now please go and leave me in peace.</strong></em></p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Sanfyrd would offer up no further information regarding either the Compactor 
        or Kozyn. Following my discussion with Sanfyrd, I decided to check to 
        see if Kozyn had returned, and indeed he had. This was my discussion with 
        him:<br>

                We exiled him and destroyed all his containers. Now we hear the

      <p>Kozyn gave me a turquoise gem and went on his way.<br>
        <br>
        Now you may be wondering why I felt this was all a little disturbing. 
        On the surface, it would seem great that someone is willing to trade for 
        an item that no one has been able to find a use for. However, the emergence 
        of the T.B.I. does cause me some concern. It would appear that the T.B.I. 
        has the power to exile any Gnome that has been accused of defective Tinkering, 
        without any sort of appeal. Have any of you heard of Tinmizer before any 
        of this? I certainly cannot find any record of him. He seems to have completely 
        disappeared, as if he has never existed...<br>
        <br>
        The next time you attempt to Tinker an item, take a look over your shoulder. 
        There may be a Gnome watching you with great interest...<br>

    <td>Greetings everyone. As I suspected, I've received quite a few more registrations 
      for the <a
        href="locator.html">GPS</a> now that it is up. I'm not going to list the 
      additions here in the news section, so head on over to the GPS. For those 
      that don't yet know, the Gnome Positioning System has been set up to allow 
      for the tracking down of a specific Tinker that may be able to help you 
      out with your Tinkering needs. If you've found this new section helpful, 
      please write in and let me know. I always like to hear when the Compendium 
      has helped out others.<br>

    <td>Greetings all! Quite an update today. As you may see from the icons above, 
      I've added a couple of new sections to the Compendium. The first section 
      is one that I've been talking about for the past week. The Gnome Positioning 
      System (or <a href="locator.html">GPS</a>) has been set up to allow Tinkers 
      to advertise their wares. So far, there are only a few entries, but I'm 
      sure that I'll soon have a flood of mail once you see how valuable this 
      section is. Oh boy, are the Bards of Antonica going to love me for this 
      one! I'm sure they'll thank me later once they realize how toned they've 
      become from lugging around my mailbags.<br>
      <br>
      If you've written in with your support for the GPS in the past, please write 
      in again with your registration, as I don't necessarily have all of your 
      personal information. It would help if you created your mailing with a subject 
      of GPS, and be sure to include all of the information I listed in the April 
      3rd news item.<br>
      <br>
      The second new section is one that I've wanted to do for a while now. The 
      <a href="curios.html">Gnomish Curios</a> section was created to display 
      all of the interesting Gnomish items that have been found throughout Norrath. 
      Tynk Mindrifter of Mithaniel Marr has done a great job of providing most 
      of the information that is in this section. If you've come across new items, 
      or know the purpose of those already listed, please write in.<br>
      <br>
      And speaking of Tynk Mindrifter, I've decided to create a new Golden Gear 
      Award in his honour. The new Furthing Gnomish Pursuits award has been created 
      to showcase those that have greatly contributed to the community. Check 
      out how Tynk has really helped us all in the <a
        href="goldengear.html">Golden Gear</a> section. Congratulations Tynk!<br>

    <td>Greetings, and welcome back to the Compendium. Every so often, I receive 
      mail from another Norrathian asking if it would be possible for us to get 
      together and chat about Tinkering. Unfortunately, I never seem to be able 
      to find the time to actually do so (sometimes I'm so absorbed in my latest 
      invention that I look up from my workbench only to realize that another 
      week has gone by).<br>
      <br>
      So, here's my suggestion: perhaps on Thursday April 13, we can all meet 
      in a chat room and discuss Tinkering and other Gnomish endeavours. It would 
      be an open forum with no set agenda. Hopefully some of the Master Tinkers 
      out there would join in and lend a hand. Write in and let me know your thoughts. 
      If I see that even a handful of people are interested, then I'll set it 
      up.<br>
      <br>
      Following my suggestion for a Gnome Positioning System, or GPS, last week, 
      a number of you have written in to state your interest. I'm sure that as 
      others find the section, they'll also want to get involved. With this response, 
      I've decided to add it to the Compendium. For the moment, there won't be 
      a way for you to automatically add yourself (hopefully this will be added 
      at a later time). Therefore, if you'd like to be involved, you'll have to 
      write in, and allow me time to manually add you to the list. It would be 
      good if you included the following:<br>

                <li>A comment that you'd like to see next to your name. Perhaps 
                  where you usually hang out and when you are usually on. Those 
                  are just suggestions, and you may include anything you wish. 
                  Just be sure to keep it brief.</li>

        I do not want this to become a place where Gnomes try to out sell each 
        other based on a price listed next to their name. As most of you know, 
        I'm open to any and all suggestions, so be sure to write in if you feel 
        that something is missing or should be changed. Let the mailings begin!<br>

      <p>This is great news! Now, from everything that I've read, Poison will 
        be upgraded sometime after the expansion. This doesn't give us a lot of 
        time to gather our thoughts and try to influence the gods in their Tinkering 
        direction. In addition to the <a
        href="community.html">Community Recipes</a> section here, I'm also trying 
        to get some Tinkering forums going at EQPortal so that we may begin to 
        discuss our ideas. Once we have our forums, I'll of course add a page 
        to the Compendium to record our ideas. This could very well be one of 
        the more exciting times for Tinkering. I can't wait!<br>
        <br>
        On to other news: Cibtek of The Tribunal wrote in to confirm that the 
        Flameless Lantern is indeed trivial at 68. Sounds like this issue can 
        be closed. If the trivial level was changed at one time, it sounds like 
        it is back to where it has always been.<br>

      Today is a great day for us all. The gods of Norrath have finally allowed 
      Tinkers to create the Thermal Cloak. Gozza was the first to report the finding 
      of the Tattered Gnomish Cloak in Sol A on a Clockwork XB in the live worlds. 
      Logaan Trainweck of Mithaniel Marr reports to have found one on the Bartender, 
      and Malbadon of The Rathe has found one on a Goblin Torturer. Wonks Stubbs 
      of The Nameless was the first to report that the Tattered Gnomish Cloak 
      has an AC of 2 and can only be worn by Gnomes. The <a href="ingredients.html">Ingredients</a> 
      section has been updated.<br>
      <br>
      I'd also like to announce that Malbadon of The Rathe was the first to report 
      the creation of a Thermal Cloak! You'll find a picture of a proud Malbadon 
      sporting his new cloak in the <a href="cloak.html">Thermal Cloak</a> section. 
      The ingredients are as follows:<br>

      <p>Malbadon has a Tinkering skill of 102, and the creation of the Thermal 
        Cloak was trivial to him. Others that have reported the creation of the 
        Thermal Cloak include Wonks Stubbs of The Nameless and Sintin Kneekicker 
        of Cazic Thule.<br>
        <br>
        Now's the time to hand out some awards for sharing all of this information 
        with the Tinkering community. Gozza will receive the award for finding 
        the first Tattered Gnomish Cloak in the live worlds. Malbadon of The Rathe 
        will receive the award for creating the first Thermal Cloak. The award 
        for the Thermal Cloak trivial point will be put on hold until some more 
        Gnomes have created Thermal Cloaks and the trivial point can be confirmed. 
        Congratulations to all! You may find the awards in the <a

        discover incorrect or missing information, please let me know. If you 
        sent in a GPS request up until today but do not see yourself listed, please 
        write in and let me know that too. It's great to see so many Gnomes taking 
        up their heritage.<br>

        I've removed the Lens of Sort from the <a
        href="curios.html">Curios</a> section as it was discovered that this is

        Sinrakin Shadowshaper of Tarew Marr wrote in with this information.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, many of you have written in with recipes to be added to the Community 
        Recipes section. This will be the next section that will receive a major 
        update, so please hang in there. And for those that have written in asking: 
        The Community Recipes section holds recipes that cannot currently be made 
        in Norrath. Hopefully we'll be able to change that :)<br>

                a gnome <br>
                showed off a new 'invention'.&nbsp; It was a floating lantern

                effects, casting fireshield on everyone around it (then it started 
                <br>

                in <br>

                heater, and both members in my group managed to loot/inspect the 
                <br>
                items on the corpse.&nbsp; The following is the log from what 
                they <br>
                reported:<br>
                <br>
                [Wed Apr 19 20:11:58 2000] Calador tells the group, 'wiz spell,

                [Wed Apr 19 20:12:22 2000] Calador tells the group, 'and gizmo 
                #6'<br>
                [Wed Apr 19 20:14:07 2000] Ursoo tells the guild, 'gears, amber, 
                <br>
                large lantern, metal parts'<br>
                <br>
                Now the gnomes argued over the fact that they 'should have' used 
                <br>
                gizmo #4 to keep the item from being dangerous.&nbsp; Plus, I 
                think Ursoo <br>
                was refering to metal bits, not metal parts.. but I dont know

    <td>Greetings everyone! Well, it has been a busy week for me, and I've only 
      just now had a chance to update the Compendium. There's a lot to talk about, 
      so let's get started.<br>
      <br>
      First off, a lot more Gnomes have been added to the <a
        href="locator.html">GPS</a>. It's great to see so many names up there, 
      but it would also be great if more of you registered. Even if you are not 
      Tinkering at the moment, it's always good to see how many Gnomes are out 
      there. I've decided to add my own name to the list even though I rarely 
      have time to Tinker items for others (heck, I rarely have time to Tinker 
      items for myself.). One note about the GPS: I will not put actual prices 
      into this section. I would not be able to keep up with the mail that this 
      would generate as Gnomes lower their prices to compete with others, nor 
      would I want this section to become bogged down with price wars.<br>
      <br>
      Not too long ago I reported that I had heard that the Rebreather might not 
      need to be placed on the head to work. Well, Knok Verst of Karana has written 
      in to state that Rebreathers do still need to be placed on the head to work.<br>
      <br>
      Muddletupper of Mithaniel Marr has written in with some news on the Metal 
      Disk in the <a href="curios.html">Gnomish Curios</a> section. Check out 
      the page for the details.<br>
      <br>
      Xila Cloudweaver wrote in to let us know that Gnomish Spirits may also be 
      brewed. I've updated the <a
        href="ingredients.html">Ingredients</a> section with this information.<br>
      <br>
      Salastil of Tallon Zek has petitioned a GM regarding Kozyn not providing 
      information on Big Bynn. Salastil has been told that this is currently not 
      working, and should be fixed soon.<br>
      <br>
      Two new Gemcutter suggestions have come in. The first is from Filitin, who 
      suggests that someone should cast identify on a Gemcutter. Sounds like a 
      good idea. Filitin also suggest that the Gemcutter be used on a piece of 
      glass from a pottery merchant. The second suggestion comes from Xyntress 
      of The Rathe who suggests that the Gemcutter is used to add gems to clothing. 
      Perhaps this would allow tailors to create magically enhanced clothing? 
      I've added both suggestions to the <a

      that occured last week. Here's Omnipotus' letter:<br>

              <p><em>To: The Illustrious Guild of Tinkers and Inventors, Ak'anon 
                Chapter<br>
                From: Omnipotus<br>
                Subject: The Fall of Gear Norther<br>
                <br>
                It is with a heavy heart that I must report the most recent accident 
                regarding the Tinkers and the trials we underwent to restore one 
                gnome's hope for the future.<br>
                <br>
                It began with a frantic cry coming from the windmills of our beloved 
                Steamfont, as one of our number ran about, seemingly lost, begging 
                for help. His name was Fringle Doon and he was in the midst of 
                completing his greatest creation: a device which would eliminate 
                all hunger from the world. Somehow, though, a foul thief broke 
                into his laboratory and stole the last of the components!<br>
                <br>
                Desperately, Fringle begged us to track down the thief, a halfling 
                by the name of Meepenny. Calling upon the impressive forces of 
                those who had gathered at the windmills, we were magically transported 
                to the Misty Thicket, where the hunt for the dastardly rogue began. 
                While I myself am of this illustrious profession, I must say I 
                found myself driven to track her down and retrieve her ill-gotten 
                gains in the interest of furthering the ways of the tinker.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, we found her, and she was dispatched with brutal efficiency. 
                Once more, Eldritch winds transported us back to Steamfont, where 
                we raced back to the windmills with the stolen parts.<br>
                <br>
                When we arrived, we found Fringle along with his creation, called 
                Gear Norther. Although it resembled the clockworks that roam Steamfont, 
                this one was quite docile..at first. Hurriedly, Fringle completed 
                the last bits of work, and a collective cheer rose from the group. 
                Gear Norther began to move from person to person, distributing 
                food to each of us. Truly a wondrous creation!!<br>
                <br>
                During the theft, however, Meepenny must have done something to 
                damage the delicate parts, because suddenly a horrid screeching 
                arose from Gear Norther and it began to shake fiercely. Suddenly, 
                it turned and attacked one of our companions!! It was trying to 
                turn him into food!! <br>
                <br>
                With a heavy heart, we drew our blades and lunged into the foray, 
                beating the creation with every ounce of strength. Ultimately, 
                the clockwork fell to our blows, and Fringle's sobs were heard 
                throughout Steamfont. We sought to comfort him in this time of 
                need, and he thanked us for our help, gifting each of us with 
                some gold he had gathered together during his travels.<br>
                <br>
                Each of us turned and headed back to our homes, and I could not 
                help but wonder if my tinkering career might meet such an ignoble 
                fate. Can the path of the rogue and that of the tinker co-exist? 
                Must they clash against one another, leaving only death and destruction 
                in their wake?<br>
                <br>
                Surely there must be another way...</em></p>

        looking for Bynn, and even checked for Tinmizer in the Mines of Malfunction. 
        We can only hope that someone will find Tinmizer. I wonder if him and 
        Big Bynn are on that rumoured new continent I've heard of as no one has 
        seen him wandering around any of the known continents...<br>

      King Ak'Anon and the T.B.I.</strong></font></td>

  <tr> 
    <td>Greetings all! Some interesting news today...<br>
      <br>
      To begin with, it would appear that King Ak'Anon is actually a clockwork! 
      Grouchie Grumbles of Solusek Ro wrote in yesterday (as have others since, 
      and it has also been discussed at the Ak'Anon Bar) that he was called in 
      front of the King two days ago to discover that the King is no longer using 
      his human illusion. There is now a clockwork claiming to be King Ak'Anon 
      himself.<br>
      <br>
      Now, I do not know what the rest of you think about this, but I am concerned. 
      While I embrace my Tinker heritage, there have been times when I wander 
      the corridors of Ak'Anon that I ponder who is really the master of our great 
      society. We created the clockworks to help out with our common day-to-day 
      tasks such as cleaning, policing and commerce. Their creation has allowed 
      Gnomes to focus on more intellectual pursuits. However, have we come to 
      rely on them to such a great extent that without them we would no longer 
      be able to function as a society? Have we become a slave to our own inventions?<br>
      <br>
      Now, with a clockwork in a position that we have all sworn loyalty to, I 
      can only hope that this incarnation is only temporary and that our flesh 
      and blood King will return. Perhaps the King currently fears for his life 
      and has put a duplicate in his place to draw out the attacker? Only time 
      will tell.<br>
      <br>
      On to other possibly disturbing news. Babaaeyen of Povar wrote in yesterday 
      (and others have discussed this at the Ak'Anon Bar) regarding a discussion 
      with a fellow Gnome by the name of Kozyn Gigglephizz. Kozyn was apparently 
      looking for any Tinmizer's Fabulous Compactors that may have been handed 
      out by Sanfyrd at the scrapyard, and was offering a reward. Babaaeyen also 
      mentioned that Kozyn was a part of the T.B.I., a group that I had not heard 
      of. Given this information, and the fact that I own a Compactor, I headed 
      off in search of Kozyn. Unfortunately, I was not able to find him (Babaaeyen 
      mentioned that Kozyn is usually found in the little room next to the exit 
      from Ak'Anon). I decided to go have a chat with Sanfyrd regarding the whole 
      situation, and this is what transpired:<br>

                </em><em><strong>Sanfyrd Featherhead is frightened by your inquiry. 
                I cannot speak of it. I can tell you to seek a gnome in Ak'Anon 
                named Kozyn. That is all. Now please go and leave me in peace.</strong></em></p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Sanfyrd would offer up no further information regarding either the Compactor 
        or Kozyn. Following my discussion with Sanfyrd, I decided to check to 
        see if Kozyn had returned, and indeed he had. This was my discussion with 
        him:<br>

      <p>Kozyn gave me a turquoise gem and went on his way.<br>
        <br>
        Now you may be wondering why I felt this was all a little disturbing. 
        On the surface, it would seem great that someone is willing to trade for 
        an item that no one has been able to find a use for. However, the emergence 
        of the T.B.I. does cause me some concern. It would appear that the T.B.I. 
        has the power to exile any Gnome that has been accused of defective Tinkering, 
        without any sort of appeal. Have any of you heard of Tinmizer before any 
        of this? I certainly cannot find any record of him. He seems to have completely 
        disappeared, as if he has never existed...<br>
        <br>
        The next time you attempt to Tinker an item, take a look over your shoulder. 
        There may be a Gnome watching you with great interest...<br>

      I was planning on having an open chat session this Thursday to talk about 
      Tinkering and general Gnoming about (see April 3rd news item). Unfortunately, 
      due to lack of interest (I've only received one reply), I will be canceling

      I remember reading somewhere recently that it may be possible to now use 
      the Rebreather in your inventory rather than on your head. This would be 
      great news. Could someone please confirm this either way?<br>

    <td>Greetings all. I've set up some new Tinkering forums with EZBoard which 
      should allow us to discuss everything related to Tinkering and Gnoming around. 
      For the moment, you may only access them from the News page. Be sure to 
      head on over and take a look. So far, I have a general forum and a community 
      recipes forum in place. Let me know what you think.<br>

      for the <a

      additions here in the news section, so head on over to the GPS. For those 
      that don't yet know, the Gnome Positioning System has been set up to allow 
      for the tracking down of a specific Tinker that may be able to help you 
      out with your Tinkering needs. If you've found this new section helpful,

    <td>Greetings all! Quite an update today. As you may see from the icons above, 
      I've added a couple of new sections to the Compendium. The first section 
      is one that I've been talking about for the past week. The Gnome Positioning 
      System (or <a href="locator.html">GPS</a>) has been set up to allow Tinkers 
      to advertise their wares. So far, there are only a few entries, but I'm 
      sure that I'll soon have a flood of mail once you see how valuable this 
      section is. Oh boy, are the Bards of Antonica going to love me for this 
      one! I'm sure they'll thank me later once they realize how toned they've 
      become from lugging around my mailbags.<br>
      <br>
      If you've written in with your support for the GPS in the past, please write 
      in again with your registration, as I don't necessarily have all of your 
      personal information. It would help if you created your mailing with a subject 
      of GPS, and be sure to include all of the information I listed in the April 
      3rd news item.<br>
      <br>
      The second new section is one that I've wanted to do for a while now. The 
      <a href="curios.html">Gnomish Curios</a> section was created to display 
      all of the interesting Gnomish items that have been found throughout Norrath. 
      Tynk Mindrifter of Mithaniel Marr has done a great job of providing most 
      of the information that is in this section. If you've come across new items, 
      or know the purpose of those already listed, please write in.<br>
      <br>
      And speaking of Tynk Mindrifter, I've decided to create a new Golden Gear 
      Award in his honour. The new Furthing Gnomish Pursuits award has been created 
      to showcase those that have greatly contributed to the community. Check 
      out how Tynk has really helped us all in the <a
        href="goldengear.html">Golden Gear</a> section. Congratulations Tynk!<br>

    <td>Greetings, and welcome back to the Compendium. Every so often, I receive 
      mail from another Norrathian asking if it would be possible for us to get 
      together and chat about Tinkering. Unfortunately, I never seem to be able 
      to find the time to actually do so (sometimes I'm so absorbed in my latest 
      invention that I look up from my workbench only to realize that another 
      week has gone by).<br>
      <br>
      So, here's my suggestion: perhaps on Thursday April 13, we can all meet 
      in a chat room and discuss Tinkering and other Gnomish endeavours. It would 
      be an open forum with no set agenda. Hopefully some of the Master Tinkers 
      out there would join in and lend a hand. Write in and let me know your thoughts. 
      If I see that even a handful of people are interested, then I'll set it 
      up.<br>
      <br>
      Following my suggestion for a Gnome Positioning System, or GPS, last week, 
      a number of you have written in to state your interest. I'm sure that as 
      others find the section, they'll also want to get involved. With this response, 
      I've decided to add it to the Compendium. For the moment, there won't be 
      a way for you to automatically add yourself (hopefully this will be added 
      at a later time). Therefore, if you'd like to be involved, you'll have to 
      write in, and allow me time to manually add you to the list. It would be 
      good if you included the following:<br>

                <li>A mailing address if you wish to be contacted outside of Norrath</li>
                <li>A sampling of items you'd be willing to Tinker for a customer</li>
                <li>A comment that you'd like to see next to your name. Perhaps 
                  where you usually hang out and when you are usually on. Those 
                  are just suggestions, and you may include anything you wish. 
                  Just be sure to keep it brief.</li>

      <p>To let you know up front, I will not include any prices in this list. 
        I do not want this to become a place where Gnomes try to out sell each 
        other based on a price listed next to their name. As most of you know, 
        I'm open to any and all suggestions, so be sure to write in if you feel 
        that something is missing or should be changed. Let the mailings begin!<br>

        Zorik Iddysplit of Lanys T'Vyl wrote in today with a great news item. 
        Over this past weekend, Aradune was available to answer any question that 
        us Norrathians had. Fortunately, someone asked a question about Tinkering. 
        Below is the question, and Aradune's response in bold (you may find the 
        answer post <a

      <p>This is great news! Now, from everything that I've read, Poison will 
        be upgraded sometime after the expansion. This doesn't give us a lot of 
        time to gather our thoughts and try to influence the gods in their Tinkering 
        direction. In addition to the <a
        href="community.html">Community Recipes</a> section here, I'm also trying 
        to get some Tinkering forums going at EQPortal so that we may begin to 
        discuss our ideas. Once we have our forums, I'll of course add a page 
        to the Compendium to record our ideas. This could very well be one of 
        the more exciting times for Tinkering. I can't wait!<br>
        <br>
        On to other news: Cibtek of The Tribunal wrote in to confirm that the 
        Flameless Lantern is indeed trivial at 68. Sounds like this issue can 
        be closed. If the trivial level was changed at one time, it sounds like 
        it is back to where it has always been.<br>

  <TR>
    <TD>Greetings all! It's been a slow week for Tinkering news, but this has 
      given me a chance to catch up.<BR><BR>I'll begin with the possibility of 
      the Tinkering skill cap returning. Atiny &amp; Madix of Bristlebane posted 
      that Atiny (a 16th level Enchanter) was able to raise from a skill of 105 
      to 106 using Aqualungs recently. Any other Gnomes out there raising their 
      skill beyond what Rawshark reported on last week?<BR><BR>Grundup 
      TinkertotPuddlejumper wrote in that the Gemcutter was trivial for him at 
      105 (his first Gemcutter). This confirms that the Gemcutter is trivial in 
      the low 100's (the lowest so far is 104).<BR><BR>I've received two 
      requests recently. The first is from Conar McLeod of Solusek Ro (<A 
      href="mailto:NeverRestEQ@aol.com">NeverRestEQ@aol.com</A>). Conar is 
      looking for a Master Tinker on Solusek Ro to make him some items. Please 
      write Conar if you can help him out.<BR><BR>The second request is from 
      Kellan McCleod of Tarew Marr (<A 
      href="mailto:only1eagle@yahoo.com">only1eagle@yahoo.com</A>). Kellan is 
      looking for a Tinker on Tarew Marr to create either a Rebreather or an 
      Aqualung. Please write Kellan if you are able to help him 
      out.<BR><BR>These two requests have gotten me thinking (a dangerous thing 
      to do at the best of times). Perhaps I need a new section here at the 
      Compendium, a Gnome Positioning System (or GPS) of sorts. This new section 
      would contain a list of Tinkers on various servers, and would include what 
      items they would be willing to create and how to best contact them. Write 
      in and let me know your thoughts.<BR><BR>With the lack of Tinkering news 
      this week, I've been able to finally publish the remaining recipes from 
      the Posting 16681 campaign. The <A 
      href="community.html">Community 
      Recipes</A> section has now grown to such a size, that I'm considering 
      separate pages for some of the more prolific inventors. Piip and Cambus 
      are definitely the key culprits here :) Hopefully the new forums will be 
      in place at EQPortal soon, and then we may continue the insanity. Until 
      then, you may continue to send in your ideas directly to me. Here are all

  <TR>
    <TD>Some bad news folks: Rawshark of Bristlebane reports that the 
      Tinkering skill cap may be back. Recently, at 20th level, Rawshark 
      performed 20 attempts to make Stalking Probes, and raised from a skill of 
      75 to 80. Rawshark then tried to make the probes another 80 times, without 
      seeing a skill increase. Is there another Gnome that can confirm 
      this?<BR><BR>For some good news, Kahnlyn of Povar has written in to let us 
      know that a few patches ago, the Flameless Lantern trivial point was 
      indeed 68. That makes two reports, each with different trivial points, and 
      two reports of the trivial point never changing. Any others?<BR><BR>Going 
      through the <A 
      href="links.html">Links</A> section of 
      the Compendium, I realized that I had the old link to the Stratics Gnome 
      forum. It's now been changed to the correct address.<BR><BR>Finally, Knok 
      Verst of Karana has written in with a See Invisible Goggles recipe, so 
      I've added it to the <A

    <TD>I haven't received one of these for quite a while: Pharos 
      Plaguebringer of Povar wrote in with an attempt on using the Gemcutter. 
      Pharos tried to combine a Gemcutter and a Large Black Lodestone in a 
      toolbox without success. In addition to adding this information to the <A

      lost in all of the suggestions.<BR><BR>Mizlek Binklewurt of The Nameless 
      wrote in regarding the possible trivial level change for the Flamless 
      Lantern. Mizlek found that the trivial level for the Flameless Lantern is 
      still at 68. Are there any other Gnomes that can confirm that it has or 
      has not changed?<BR><BR>I've updated the <A

  <TR>
    <TD>Greetings fellow Tinkers and Tinker supporters! I must apologize for 
      the lack of updates. After I returned from my trip earlier this week (I 
      was running an errand for the King.), King Ak'Anon asked that I work on a 
      new invention for him. I've been locked in my workshop these past few 
      days, toiling away. If you heard a dull, echoing boom while travelling 
      through Ak'Anon recently, well, that was me. Let's just say that once I 
      awoke and pulled myself out of the wall, I found that the invention did 
      not go as planned! I sure was glad that I was wearing my blinking light 
      cap. As the King has asked that I not reveal too much (state secrets and 
      all), I'll have to leave it at that.<BR><BR>Now onto the reason you are 
      here. I'll begin with some interesting news regarding trivial levels of 
      the recipes. I've received two reports within the last week regarding the 
      point at which the Flameless Lantern becomes trivial. Since the beginning, 
      it has always been trivial at a skill of 68. However, Nezzar Enkahmen of 
      Rodcet Nife has written in to state that the Lantern was trivial at a 
      skill of 65. I've also received a letter from Xila Cloudweaver of Fennin 
      Ro stating that the trivial level is at a skill of 54. What concerns me 
      most is that the trivial level has changed at all. If it has, then what 
      other recipes have changed? I could really use your help in determining 
      the state of all this. It could, unfortunately, mean that Tinkering has 
      just gotten even more expensive. Perhaps the price of the Tinkering cap 
      being removed?<BR><BR>I've received an interesting letter from Rubix of 
      Innoruuk. Rubix has been in contact with a Gnome named Abou, also of 
      Innoruuk, who claims that the Rebreather trivial level is at 183. If there 
      is a Gnome that can confirm this, please write in. It would be even better 
      if Abou would let me know personally.<BR><BR>Mr. Miaegi of Quellious has 
      written in with some Gemcutter ideas. You may find them in the <A 
      href="cutter.html">Gemcutter</A> 
      section.<BR><BR>Ajaz has also written in with some Gemcutter ideas. You 
      may find them in the Gemcutter section as well.<BR><BR>The last Gemcutter 
      idea has been sent in by a High Elf named Desmulath of The Tribunal. It is 
      actually quite interesting. It involves that Shadow Knight quest that we 
      keep stumbling across whenever we talk about the Gemcutter. There are some 
      interesting connections (especially regarding the Ice Giants), so be sure 
      to take a look.<BR><BR>Jodrin Tinkeralot of The Nameless has written in to 
      let us know that Gnomish Spirits may also be found in East Freeport at one 
      of the bars. Many Gnomes have already found this, but I thought it 
      worthwhile to post it for those that don't. I've updated the <A 
      href="ingredients.html">Ingredients</A> 
      section with this information.<BR><BR>I've not had a chance to put up the 
      rest of the Community Recipes that were written during the Posting 16681 
      campaign, but I have put up any recipes that were sent to me directly in 
      the <A href="community.html">Community 
      Recipes</A> section. Hopefully next week, I'll have a forum here at the 
      Compendium where we may continue to post our inventions.<BR><BR>Finally, 
      the people at ThySky.org have asked that I put up a link to their site. It 
      would seem that they are trying to put together a daily news section that 
      summarizes all EQ sites. You may find the link in the <A 
      href="links.html">Links</A> 
    section.<BR></TD></TR>

    <TD>Greetings! I've managed to transcribe all recipes from the Posting 
      16681 campaign up to and including February 26th into the <A 
      href="community.html">Community 
      Recipes</A> section. I'll continue to add in the remainders as I have 
      time, but thought you'd like to see what's been added so far. I am also 
      working towards having a forum where we may continue to post our ideas, 
      and I'm hoping that we may choose some to place on the official Wishlist 
      forum in the near future.<BR><BR>I've also modified the <A 
      href="abashi.html">Community Posting</A> 
      section to reflect our recent response to our questions.<BR><BR>While we 
      know not to focus on the Thermal Cloak any longer, Gyro of Solusek Ro 
      wrote in with a clarification in regards to an idea that was posted a week 
      ago. Gyro wanted to let us know that the twice woven cloak is used in a 
      Temple of Ro quest.<BR><BR>I should also let you know that I will be 
      unavailable for the next few days. King Ak'Anon has requested that I run 
      an errand for him (and I can't say no to the big guy), so I will not be 
      updating the Compendium or likely answering my mail until after Sunday. 
      The Bards really won't be too pleased with me, and I'm sure I'll find 
      mailbags all over my workshop, but I'll deal with this when I return. 
      Until then, go forth and Tinker, and remember not to point your spyglass 
      towards the Princess' chamber (a story for another time)!<BR></TD></TR>

    <TD>Well, it's been a couple of days since we finally received a reply to 
      our month-long campaign. I've been resting and taking time to focus on 
      some non-Tinker stuff that's been piling up. Unfortunately, my unanswered 
      mail has also been piling up. It's forming quite a tower on my workbench. 
      The Bards are now refusing to deliver it and ask that I come and pick it 
      up myself. If you haven't heard from me in a couple of days, don't worry. 
      I should get through it all by Monday.<BR><BR>I also hope to have the 
      Community Recipes section updated on Monday. I've got your blueprints 
      scattered all over the place, and need to organize it all. Some really 
      great ideas have been brought forward in the last two weeks during our 
      Posting 16681 campaign, and all of them will make it to the Community 
      Recipes section. It'll just take a little time.<BR><BR>Regarding the 
      Posting 16681 campaign, we may have received an official reply, but our 
      work is not done. While we now know to no longer focus our energies on the 
      Thermal Cloak, we're still not any further along with the Gemcutter 
      (although it does sound like the Gemcutter is used for something). We 
      should also prepare for the day when Tinkering is finally reworked. 
      Rosepike has suggested that we set up a document to capture our ideas on 
      how Tinkering should be retooled, and I couldn't agree more. I'm going to 
      give some thought as to how we should approach this, but I think it would 
      take the form of a public forum, and a place to store our results. Sounds 
      like another section for the Compendium.<BR><BR>Have fun out there, and 
      remember not to set off fireworks near straw-roofed houses (a story for 
      another time)!<BR></TD></TR>

              things that tread on a class ability to any great 
              extent.<BR><BR>As to a couple of other questions that I've seen in

    <TD>Greetings all! Yesterday's Tinkering Tuesday event was great. It was

      href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/021326.html">Posting 
      16681</A>. Some great points were brought forward (summarized by Rosepike) 
      which should be added to the series of original questions. There were also 
      quite a number of new recipes suggested. A truely unique form of showing 
      your support for the posting. Cambus should be singled out for the most 
      recipes in a single day.<BR><BR>The unfortunate fact to all of this is 
      that we did not receive an official reply. Abashi had posted to other 
      messages during the day, so he was lurking about. I have to admit that I 
      was quite discouraged by the end of the day. But today is a new day, and 
      us Gnomes cannot be held back. So go forth and post your continued 
      support! Go now! No, stop reading this and go post. I mean it. Don't make 
      me come over there...<BR><BR>Now that you've gone and posted your support 
      for the Tinkering community, we may continue with the rest of today's 
      news.<BR><BR>Lisje of Lanys T'Vyl had an interesting idea that the 
      Gemcutter may be used with the Blacksmith skill. I've posted Lisje's 
      message in the <A

    <TD>A few have written recently to say that the posting from yesterday 
      regarding a new Tinkering volume has been confirmed as a hoax. One of you

      16681</A>. Unfortunately, we still have not received an official response. 
      To put this into perspective, I've been told that when the Paladins wrote 
      in with a series of well thought out questions/suggestions that it took a 
      month and a half before they received a response. What is the most 
      frustrating is that it would seem that posts containing unreasonable

      likely a dead end. See the <A

      section for details.<BR><BR>There is quite a discussion occuring on the 
      Tinkering Mailing List regarding the use of the Gemcutter. Many are 
      suggesting that the Gemcutter be used in a Jeweler's Kit with the 
      following ingredients: 1 pearl, 1 metal bar (ie: silver), 1 Gemcutter, 1 
      bottle of grease. I've also read a suggestion of: 1 pearl, 1 ring, 1 
      Gemcutter, 1 bottle of grease. To date, the above suggestions have not 
      been tried. I've added this information to the <A 
      href="cutter.html">Gemcutter</A> 
      section.<BR><BR>Also on the Tinkering Mailing List, Brillian clarified 
      that only Firework #4 will attract the wrong kind of attention, and that 
      the first three should be harmless.<BR></TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>Greetings everyone! I haven't posted to the Compendium for a few days, 
      so there's lots to catch up on. First of all, I wanted to let you know why 
      I haven't updated the Compendium lately. Something great is happening on 
      Fennin Ro, and I encourage all that are on Fennin Ro to check it out. It's 
      the Collective of Old Fennin. A number of people are working together to 
      create a new environment, including setting up a system of rulership for 
      the various regions. You may find out more about it <A 
      href="http://www.sok.org/fenninro/">here</A>. I've start to do my part by 
      creating the Kingdom of A'Anon. If you're interested in it (and I hope all 
      Fennin Ro Gnomes are), you may find it <A 
      href="http://www.geocities.com/akanongov/">here</A>. As always, please 
      send your comments my way (preferably by posting on the forum at the 
      Collective of Old Fennin Ro). OK, enough of this. Back to the reason you 
      are here...<BR><BR>Quite a few Gnomes have written in and requested that I 
      add a new page to the Compendium. This new page would list Tinkered items 
      that the Tinerking community has come up with. The idea being that these 
      will also be posted to the official Wishlist forum whereupon new Tinkering 
      items may be added to Norrath. I think this is a wonderful idea, and have 
      starting working on it. Most of the new items will come from those posted 
      in <A 
      href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/016681.html">Post 
      16681</A>. In fact, if you have a new Tinkered item idea, please post it 
      there. Once the post is finally responded to, I'll see about setting up a 
      forum where we may all suggest new items.<BR><BR>A number of Gnomes and 
      non-Gnomes (or is it gnon-Gnomes?) alike have written to suggest using 
      grease with the Gemcutter. While it is known that grease is used in the 
      construction of the Gemcutter, many strongly feel that Gimblestan's phrase 
      "<EM>...while only requiring a small bit of Grease to reduce 
      friction.</EM>" indicates that grease is required during the use of the 
      Gemcutter as well. I've add this suggestion to the <A 
      href="cutter.html">Gemcutter</A> 
      section.<BR><BR>Tynk Mindrifter wrote in that he has given 250 bone chips 
      to Gunlok Jure of the Paladin guild in Kaladim. It was rumoured that 
      Gunlok gave out Tattered armour. Indeed, Tynk received (as well as some 
      other items) small tattered leggings, gloves, tunics, and sleeves, but so 
      far, no small tattered cloak for the Thermal Cloak. I've added this 
      information to the <A 
      href="cloak.html">Thermal Cloak</A> 
      section.<BR><BR>Gixx Fizbane wrote in that by turing in Orc Belts to 
      Canloe Nusbeck of the Warrior's guild in Kaladim, you will receive small 
      tattered armour. In the past, Gixx has received a small tattered cloak, 
      but at the time Gixx hadn't thought to use it for the Thermal Cloak. This 
      has been added to the Thermal Cloak section.<BR><BR>Byraxis of Innoruk 
      found a Torn and Ripped Tunic on a vendor, and used it with two metal rods 
      and Firewater to try and create a Thermal Cloak. Nothing was produced. 
      This has also been added to the Thermal Cloak section.<BR><BR>Konaki Jiiji 
      wrote in that in looking for a Tattered Gnomish Cloak, he, um, 
      <EM>inspected</EM> a couple of Gnomes. The first was the Gnomish Spelunker 
      found in Unrest, and the second was the Gnomish Mage found in Cazic Thule. 
      Neither Gnome had any items on them after inspecting them three times. All 
      together now: this has been added to the Thermal Cloak 
      section.<BR><BR>Gnomos of Cazic Thule was the Gnome that wrote in with the 
      confirmation of the Aqualung trivial level. I've updated the February 10th 
      news items to include his name. Just as a general reminder, if you write 
      in with information to be added to the Compendium, please include your 
      full name and server.<BR><BR>Tynk Mindrifter wrote in with a wonderful 
      list of prices for Tinkering ingredients and Tinkered items. He (as any 
      Gnome would) methodically checked the cost of every item, and even listed 
      his charisma to use as a basis for others. I should have these additions 
      in the Compendium tomorrow.<BR><BR>Finally, Derkal Pentolite has written 
      requesting that I give his <A 
      href="goldengear.html">Golden Gear</A> 
      Award to his friend Qualtz Goldenmalt, as he was the one that found 
      Diamond Dust in Permafrost. Derkal had mentioned his friend in his first 
      post to me, so it is actually my fault for not giving his friend credit. 
      What I've decided to do is award both of them for the Diamond Dust 
      information. Derkal, I still believe that you deserve the award as you 
      were the one Gnome that came forward when others wanted to keep it a 
      secret.<BR></TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>Well, two weeks have now passed since my original posting to the 
      official forum. An official reply has still not been received. It seems 
      that although we now have over five pages worth of support (and 
      interesting reading they are too), it is still not enough to elicit an 
      official response. I admit that this is a little

      Gemcutter and Thermal Cloak Suggestions and 
  Information</STRONG></FONT></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Greetings! It has been a couple of days since I made my last entry in 
      the Compendium, and the mail bags have been accumulating. I've been busy 
      at work on the new Compendium, which I hope to have complete this week. It 
      will include a new section that will hopefully encourage the continued 
      sharing of Tinkering information as this is the only way our community 
      will continue to thrive.<BR><BR>On to today's news. Maesyn Shadowdancer of 
      Tunare (a Monk) has suggested using the Gemcutter on gem shards. While it 
      is known that shards are for research, perhaps they have another use 
      (perhaps a Gemcutter can change a shard into a usable gem). I've added 
      this suggestion to the <A 
      href="cutter.html">Gemcutter</A> 
      section.<BR><BR>Tynk Mindrifter of Mithaniel Marr has suggested that since 
      Gimblestan refers to Pearls in the Ocean of Tears, perhaps there is a Lore 
      Pearl that may be found there and used with the Gemcutter. I've added this 
      information to the Gemcutter section. [Side note: Tynk, I was not able to 
      reply to your message. The Bards don't seem to have your correct return 
      address. Please write in with you correct mailing address as I'm 
      interested in your Gnomish pictures.]<BR><BR>Brellium Crafterofthings of 
      Brell Serilis created a Gemcutter and found that it can trivially be made 
      with a skill of 104. This is unfortunate as it would seem that the 
      Gemcutter does not fill in the gap between the Stalking Probes and the 
      Aqualung as much as was hoped. This information has been added to the 
      Gemcutter and the <A 
      href="recipes.html">Recipe</A> section 
      has been updated too.<BR><BR>On to the Thermal Cloak. Tynk Mindrifter of 
      Mithaniel Marr has let me know that Gunlock Jure in Kaladim randomly gives 
      out small tattered cloaks as a reward for turning in four bone chips. Tynk 
      will try to confirm this. I've add this to the <A 
      href="cloak.html">Thermal Cloak</A> 
      section.<BR><BR><FONT size=3>Nadiya Nightshade of Rallos Zek</FONT> has 
      suggested that medium sized cloaks be used when attempting the Thermal 
      Cloak. Nadiyra's reasoning is that most other quests that require a piece 
      of clothing use a medium sized one as the resultant magical item fits all 
      sizes. I've added this suggestion to the Thermal Cloak section.<BR></TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>Well, it's been a week since I first made my posting to the official 
      forum and there still has been no official reply. With the Gnomish 
      community being small in size (no, I don't mean in stature :), and the 
      Tinkering community being even smaller, it can be hard to compete with 
      some of the other more active posts. Unfortunately, it seems that that is 
      exactly what we must do to be noticed. If you haven't already done so (and 
      even if you have), I encourage you to go to the posting <A 
      href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/016681.html">here</A> 
      and reply in our usual friendly Gnomish manner. I'd also like to thank the 
      other races that have replied in our support. Thanks!<BR><BR>The Gnomish 
      community got even smaller recently (OK, enough with the puns) with the 
      loss of Manga's Tome. It's been down for a while, and has finally been 
      removed. Please, if you know of any Gnome related sites, <A 
      href="mailto:eqtinker@yahoo.com">write in</A> and I'll add them to the 
      links section of the Compendium.<BR><BR>Finally, I'd like to announce that 
      Fulcrum's Tinkering Compendium will be moving to a new location. I will be 
      taking over Gnomad's old haunt on <A 
      href="">EQPortal.com</A>. Once there, 
      you can look forward to a slight redesign and clean-up of the Compendium. 
      Hopefully, everything will be in place for the move sometime next week.

      Location and the Gemcutter</STRONG></FONT></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Greetings Gnomes! The location of Diamond Dust has been confirmed! 
      I've also been given some additional information regarding the Gemcutter, 
      so today is a rather important update.<BR><BR>
      <TABLE border=0>
        <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD>
            <UL>
              <LI>Tinker of Bristlebane was the first Gnome to write in 
              confirming the location of Diamond Dust. He has stated that 
              Diamond Dust may be found on any Ice Giant near Vox's lair (which 
              was later confirmed by many other Gnomes).<BR><BR>
              <LI>Pirotess T'Enithar also obtained some Diamond Dust and was 
              able to make a Gemcutter. He then tried to combine a gold bar, a 
              sapphire, and the Gemcutter in a Jeweler's bag. The items did not 
              combine in those quantities. Later this week, he will attempt to 
              obtain Diamond Dust again and this time combine a Gemcutter and a 
              gem in a Tinker's toolbox.<BR><BR>
              <LI><FONT size=3>Regan of Erollisi Marr also built a Gemcutter 
              after obtaining Diamond Dust from an Ice Giant, and found that it 
              is trivially made at a skill of 116. To date, this is the lowest 
              trivial point found.<BR><BR></FONT>
              <LI>Derkal Pentolite of The Rathe clarified on the Tinkering 
              Mailing List that the gem he used to test out his Gemcutter was a 
              perl. You may recall that Gimblestan refers to a perl in his 
              book.<BR><BR>
              <LI>Derkal Pentolite of The Rathe also pointed me to a notice on 
              the <A href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">EQCasters</A> board from 
              Abashi regarding the use of some Tinkering items. The question 
              posed essentially asked if the Mechanical Lockpick raises the 
              user's Lockpick skill, and does the Gemcutter raise the user's 
              Jewelry skill. Ahashi's answer was that there are no items in 
              Norrath that will increase skill. Go to this <A 
              href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=710">page</A> 
              for the full question and 
response.<BR></LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      href="http://www.eqportal.com/ingredients.html">Ingredients</A> sections. 
      I'll have the Diamond Dust and Community Posting sections updated 
      shortly.<BR><BR>One final request: Could a Gnome please send in an 
      unobstructed picture of Diamond Dust so that I may add it to the 
      Ingredients list? Thanks.<BR></P></TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>Fizzlebane of Quellious wrote in with some more zones he checked out 
      based on the location rumour (see January 7th news). With this additional 
      information, I decided to combine it all into a single table. From there, 
      you may see all of the zones that have been checked for the given location 
      (this location is not valid for most zones). I also decided to fill in 
      some more of the blanks myself. Be sure to check out the <A 
      href="http://www.eqportal.com/diamond.html">Diamond Dust</A> section but 
      remember, this location is only a rumour!<BR><BR>I've been quite 
      disapointed that Abashi has not replied to any of my mailings regarding 
      diamond dust, and the Thermal Cloak. It would appear that the best way to 
      obtain a response is to post on the public forum. Other Gnomes have tried 
      this in the past without any luck. Shortly, I will set up another page 
      here at the compendium that will contain the message I will send to the 
      public forum, and I'd like everyone to comment on it. Hopefully, with a 
      united posting, we will finally be able to get some answers to our 
      questions.</TD></TR>

      and Thermal Cloak</STRONG></FONT></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>I've received quite a lot of information and suggestions from various 
      Gnomes (and even a non-Gnome) regarding diamond dust and the Thermal 
      Cloak. First of all, <FONT color=#000000 size=3>Gnomos of Cazic Thule 
      checked out the location rumour in West Karana and Ocean of Tears, and I 
      have posted his results in the </FONT><A 
      href="http://www.eqportal.com/diamond.html"><FONT color=#000000 
      size=3>Diamond Dust</FONT></A><FONT color=#000000 size=3> 
      section.<BR><BR>A Gnome on the Tinkering Mailing List was frustrated 
      enough that he petitioned a GM. A Verant GM responded and stated that he 
      should try Crushed Dufrenite instead of Diamond Dust. He was also told 
      that the Tattered Gnomish Cloak does indeed exist, but the GM would not 
      reveal if it had to be made or found. Another Gnome did some research and 
      found that the mineral dufrenite is a phosphate and is not related to a 
      diamond, so there is some question as to the direct relation. Cogg of 
      </FONT>Rallos Zek <FONT color=#000000 size=3>reminded everyone on the 
      Mailing List of the Ogres in Lake Rathe that will crush dufrenite, and was 
      likely going to check them out again soon (</FONT>Surastik of Cazic Thule 
      had given them a diamond in the past with no luck, but giving them 
      dufrenite should work).<BR><BR>Regarding the Thermal Cloak, Pendrill of 
      Rallos Zek has suggested using a material other than a patchwork cloak, 
      such as leather. This does bring up a great idea of trying other fabrics, 
      such as damask or gossimer. Earenhylle of Rallos Zek (a Dark Elf) has 
      suggested using reinforced leather armour as it contains steel boning. To 
      create it, use a large sewing kit and combine: Cloak pattern, High Quality 
      Bear/Cat/Wolf pelt, and 2 Steel bonings. Any Gnome tailors willing to try 
      this combination out? I've added this information to the <A 
      href="http://www.eqportal.com/cloak.html">Thermal Cloak</A> page of the 
      compendium.<BR></TD></TR>

    <TD>Askur of Veeshan on the Tinkering Mailing List has stated that a good 
      friend of his found diamond dust in PAW, and sold it for 150pp in South 
      Karana (his friend didn't know how important this item was). Unfortunately 
      his friend does not remember where in PAW he obtained it, but the two of 
      them were going to look for it soon.<BR><BR>Along the same lines, Glenin 
      of Fennin Ro (a High Elf) shouted out a couple of nights ago asking what 
      diamond dust was for (as reported on the Tinkering Mailing List). He then 
      sold off the diamond dust and refused to tell anyone where he found it.

      href="archive.html#DIAMOND">here</A>. 
      I've gone through the Tinkering Mailing List and have summarized my 
      findings. Be sure to check it out and let me know if there are additional 
      places that Gnomes have searched. I'd hate for a Gnome to lose a diamond 
      when the lead has already proven false. I am also in the process of trying 
      to get some official word regarding diamond dust (I'm including the 
      Thermal Cloak in this too). I will let you all know what I am able to find 
      out.</TD></TR>

    <TD>Fayghon of Karana has informed me that Potters can also create 
      skewers. I've changed the skewer in the ingredient section to indicate 
      this.<BR><BR>Dakirn has again been busy with the Thermal Cloak. He tried 
      placing a small patchwork cloak and a metal rod into a small sewing kit 
      (the small kit only has two slots). It didn't work out. He'll see about 
      trying a medium sewing kit sometime soon. I've changed the Thermal Cloak

  <TR>
    <TD>Dakirn of Tunare wrote in today with more <A 
      href="archive.html#FAILED">Thermal 
      Cloak</A> attempts, this time including a belt! He offers up a new 
      approach of trying to do the belt and cloak separately. This leads to 
      something that another Gnome wrote to me about a while ago: Is it possible 
      that we should first Tailor the rods to the cloak? Just an 
      idea...<BR><BR><FONT size=3>Onto diamond dust, the ingredient for the 
      Gemcutter. I've received some mail from Gnomes regarding this item and 
      trying to obtain it. In this regard, I've decided to do two things. The 
      first, is to create a new section listing all of the places that need to 
      be checked out (and have already been checked) according to those in the 
      know. I'll start by going through the mailing list and try to compile what 
      has already been said. You can then add to it.<BR><BR>The second is I'd 
      like to try to get an official confirmation that diamond dust is even in 
      Norrath. It's possible that the item may just have been missed. I'll see 
      about contacting Abashi directly and perhaps try to make this compendium 
      some kind of unified Gnome voice. To accomplish this, I'll need to track 
      down Abashi's address. If you happen to already have this, please 
      </FONT><A href="mailto:eqtinker@yahoo.com"><FONT size=3>pass it 
      on</FONT></A><FONT size=3> as otherwise I'll have to get my Dwarf friend 
      to do some Internet mining again (Dwarves are very good at

              planned. December 26th, 1999 11:00 AM PST.<BR><BR>Fellow gnomes 
              come an hour early to discuss the following:<BR><BR>1. Tinkered 
              item prices. I don't wish to undercut my fellow Gnomes when 
              selling tinkered goods. We should discuss setting prices. This 
              should not however prevent us from discounting items for 
              guildmembers.<BR><BR>2. Trivial skill items. Most everything is 
              trivial to me now. If I am asked to make items that are trivial 
              I'd rather be able to give the name of a Gnome who might get a 
              skill improve from the tinkering.<BR><BR>3. Tinkering help. We 
              could give each other tinkering help and perhaps discuss a 
              tinkering site since Gnomad's site is gone 
          now.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>Thanks everyone for the overwhelming response to my compendium. I 
      really appreciate it. Please remember that all of this would not be 
      possible if not for Gnomad and all of the Gnomes that stuck with it and 
      were willing to part with their hard-earned platinum.<BR><BR>Onto some new 
      stuff. A couple of Gnomes had some good suggestions, and I've created two 
      new sections as a result. The first section isn't really new, but the 
      moving of the recipes to its own page. This should allow easier printing 
      for reference while in the game. The second section is a listing of all 
      the Tinkering components and where to find them. No, I don't have a 
      location for Diamond Dust :) Keep on sending in those suggestions!</TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>It looks like this is the week for Tinkering sites. There's a new site 
      from Manga, another from Morty, as well as Gnomad's guide on Allakhazam's 
      site (I suppose this is the last word from Gnomad). Links to all of these 
      may be found below.<BR><BR>Also, some of you may have noticed that I am 
      filling in the icons for each of the Tinkered items in the recipe section. 
      If you happen to have a picture of an item that I do not yet have posted, 
      it would be much appreciated if you could pass it on to me at my address 
      at the bottom of the page. I'll continue to fill them in as I make items, 
      so be sure to check back prior to Tinkering something for the purpose of 
      sending it to me. Thanks!</TD></TR>

    <TD>Rumours are flying on the EQ Tinkering Mailing List that the skill cap

      Fireworks</STRONG></FONT></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>While this is probably old news to some, others don't seem to know 
      that Gnomish Fireworks have been updated. No longer is there a microsecond 
      flash in our face when setting them off. There now appears to be two 
      types: ones that launch a coloured flare in the direction you are facing 
      (or towards your selected target), and the other a sparkle that surrounds 
      the person holding the launcher accompanied by a loud explosion. I have 
      yet to determine how to select which occurs, but if you know please write 
      me.<BR><BR>I used the new fireworks to great success on December 9th 
      following the marriage of Takashi and Junivera in Lake Rathe. I passed out 
      the fireworks to a couple of friends, and we ascended the Erudite Tower. 
      We then launched flares and sparkles over the crowd. It was perhaps the 
      largest fireworks display to date. We'll have to see about organizing a 
      future large fireworks display put on by the Ak'Anon Corps of Explosion 
      Engineers, perhaps to mark the King's birthday.</TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>Hi all! Welcome to Fulcrum's Tinkering Compendium. I've built this 
      guide in response to Gnomad taking his down, and because of problems 
      accessing other Tinkering sites. I hope to put up here everything that is 
      known about Tinkering, and I'll start with a table listing all known 
      Tinker items and at what skill level the items become trivial at. This 
      information should not be new to anyone who has been in the Tinkering 
      business for a while, but it doesn't seem to be too common to find it in 
      one place.<BR><BR>Regarding other sites, Catben Flinkilur does have a good 
      site up, and you may find it in the links below. I'd also recommend that 
      everyone check out the Tinking mailing list as well as the EQ Stratics 
      Tinkering trade forum, which is where I usually hang out.<BR><BR>Please 
      take a look around, and if you find a mistak :) or want to suggest 
      something, you may contact me at the address 
below.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
