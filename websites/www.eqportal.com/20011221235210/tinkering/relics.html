    <TD>Every week I receive mail asking about an item that the general 
      populace has heard about, but are not sure why a Tinker has yet to have 
      built one. A great example of this are infrared goggles. I hope that this 
      section will enlighten those that search for such items.<BR></TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>There was a time when many more of Gimblestan's volumes were available 
      and Tinkers were a powerful group in Norrath. Many Gnome scholars refer to 
      this as the Age of Beta (no doubt named after Betaben, the Gnome scholar 
      that lived during this period and recorded much of its history). At the 
      end of the Age of Beta, the gods themselves descended upon the land. They 
      used the populace as pawns to fight their quarrels for them. Thus began 
      the Age of Darkness.<BR><BR>During the Age of Darkness, the sun never 
      shone on the land, and hardship was felt by all. It was a time of waiting. 
      Waiting for the birth of a new world. Most of Gmiblestan's volumes were 
      lost during this age.<BR><BR>The Age of Darkness did pass to give rise to 
      the world that we all live in today. Populations began to rebuild 
      themselves and flourish (in fact, many scholars now debate the 
      overcrowding of our world). Two of Gimblestan's volumes survived and 
      Tinkers began to rebuild. The search for the Tattered Gnomish Cloak 
      began.<BR><BR>Many years later, rumours of additional volumes surfaced. 
      After much speculation and debate within the Gnomish community, two more 
      volumes were rediscovered. The search for Diamond Dust began. This brings 
      us to the present, with the currently known four volumes of 
      Gimblestan.<BR><BR></TD></TR>

    <TD>Below is a letter I've had in my possesion for quite a while that 
      describes what Tinkers from the Age of Beta were able to build. It was 
      originally posted to the Tinkering Mailing List. Keep in mind that this 
      letter was written prior to the discovery of the latest Gimblestan 
      volumes.<BR>

              <P><EM><BR>I clipped this information off a very old post by 
              Phylab Tikerput 
              at<BR>http://eq.stratics.com/gamersforum/tradeskills.html.<BR>I 
              thought some of the newer list people might find it 
              interesting.<BR><BR>Spring, 18th 
              Magician<BR>Veeshan<BR><BR><BR>His 
              Post.<BR>-------------------------------<BR>Some facts: According 
              to Verant, Tinkering unbalanced the game. This is evident by the 
              many items that where removed, statements from Lead GM's of 
              certain servers, and statements from several gnomes that during 
              BETA actually saw the items and the books. at least Verant saw fit 
              that they unbalanced the game, so they removed them. Second, many 
              of the tinkerable items where severly bugged, and do to the 
              release schedule (which was hurried out the door in May) caused 
              the work on these items to be diverted on others.<BR><BR>Most of 
              the items where magicly charged items. In other words, the item 
              was held and then when clicked used a charge and casted the spell 
              that was relevant to the item. For example; Gnomish Goggles are 
              NOT permanent goggles that you wear and can see at night, They are 
              the level 16? Heat Sight spell that has 5 charges. When right 
              clicked the user uses a charge and has Heat sight for its standard 
              duration. Sorry to spoil it, but this is how ALL or most of the 
              items worked. Scouts; which are tinkerable now, are the level 8 
              Eye of Zomm spell with 5 charges, right clicking uses a charge and 
              gives the user the Eye of Zomm view for its standard 
              duration.<BR><BR>Now some info from BETA: According to Eboo (or 
              was it Dworkin?) whom ever it was that worked with me and I'm so 
              sorry I forgot your name, but thanks for repling to my cries, 
              hehehe) a guild spent over 500 platinum on trying out the 
              different tinkerable items that where in the books. I can attest 
              to this, because I myself (a Wood Elf ranger that needed a compass 
              but had no idea only gnomes could make them). Bought one of the 
              books, and it had the info on collapsible fishing 
              poles.<BR><BR>According to these books, the following items could 
              be 
              made:<BR><BR>-Firewater*+<BR><BR>Mechanical-<BR>-Compasses?*<BR>-Flameless 
              Lanterns*+<BR>-Collapsible fishing poles<BR>-Mechanized 
              Lockpicks*+<BR>-Cams*+<BR>-Thermal Cloaks?*<BR>-Gnomish Clockwork 
              I (pet rat)<BR>-Gnomish Clockwork IV (pet spider)<BR>-Gnomish 
              Clockwork XI (pet gnome male)<BR><BR>Magicly "charged" 
              items<BR>-Scouts (level 8 Eye of Zomm)*+<BR>-Spyglasses (level 8 
              Glimpse )?*<BR>-Gnomish Fireworks (level 8 Fingers of 
              Fire)<BR>-Gnomish Goggles (level 16 Heat Sight)<BR>-Scuba Gear 
              (Level ? Underwater Breathing)<BR>-Jet Pack (level 24 
              Levitate)<BR><BR>-Steel Lined Silk armor?*<BR><BR>The ones marked 
              with the (*) asterisks are remnants of the tinkering trade. The 
              ones with the (?) question mark are those that where also left, 
              but are questionable. Since many of the other components may have 
              been removed, these items have been destroyed and cannot be made. 
              Those with a (+) plus sign are those I successfully made and sold 
              throughout Greater Faydark and Freeport. The charged items can be 
              used by any race/class. This supports the theory that Verant 
              removed them becuase of game 
        inbalance.<BR></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
