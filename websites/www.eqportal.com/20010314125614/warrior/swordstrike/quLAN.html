Go to Renth McLanis in the tavern across from Mac's Kilts.  Ask him "What dangerous matter?".  He tells you of a crime.  Agree to hunt the murderer.  Renth then sends you to see Dok in Dok's Cigars.  Find out all you can about the crime.  He tells you to go see the leader of Clan McMannus.  This is the fishing village located in West Karanas.  Speak to the leader.  Then speak to Ulrich McMannus and he tells you Frostbite can track prey if he has a piece of sweaty clothing. Return to Dok and ask him "Where is the sweaty shirt?".  He then tells you he sold it to Tundra Jack.  Find Tundra Jack on the tundra of Everfrost.  He will tell you that Iceberg is using it for a collar and that you can distract Iceberg with his favorite meal, Lion Delight.  Go back to Halas and speak to Teria O' Danos.  Do the lion meat quest (you get coin and faction as well as the Lion Delight).  Once you have Lion Delight, be sure to bury it lower in your container then your normal food to prevent it being eaten by you.  Take the Lion Delight to Iceberg and receive the shirt (NO DROP, LORE ITEM) and faction adjustment.  Now run to the village and give the shirt to Frostbite. (NOTE: Frostbite will wait for the murderer to spawn before he takes off.  He walks pretty fast so I wouls strongly suggest that you have Spirit of Wolf on you.  It also helps to have a party member along that can track because I lost sight of Frostbite many times and have had to start over.  Also, Frostbite likes to fight things along the way. Help him out.  Be very careful not to target Frostbite by accident!) Frostbite will lead you right to the criminal. The murderer will be either Paglan or Basil.  Paglan is tougher to kill and probably in his low to mid 20's, Basil is around level 20.  Kill whomever the dog leads you to, hope he drops a Barbarian head and then return to Halas with the head. Give the head to Renth for faction, coin, and of course, the Langseax (if you have Basil's head) or the Langseax of the Wolves (if it is Paglan's head).  I am not sure what triggers which criminal you get or even if you can just kill both and get both heads, but it seems that you wil normally get Basil.    Short Version:  Run to village, and receive the lion meat.  Run to Halas, turn in meat to Teria and get Lion Delight, faction, exp. and coin. Run to Iceberg, give Lion Delight, receive shirt, faction, exp. Run to Frosbite, give shirt, gain exp. Kill the criminal. Return head for faction, coin, exp and Langseax.
