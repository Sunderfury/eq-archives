    <td width="608" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">A nice utility spell, many monsters don't seem as likely
    to notice you when you have minor illusion cast on yourself.&nbsp; I like to use this when
    looting my corpse in a relatively dangerous zone.&nbsp; You can't move while under this
    effect, but you can turn it off whenever you like.<p>It can also be more effective than
    invisibility in PVP.&nbsp; While invisible, some people can still see you plain as
    day.&nbsp; If you happen to look like a nearby object you may go completely unseen to the
    casual observer. &nbsp; Need a nearby object to mimic?&nbsp; Carry an extra small object,
    like fishing grub.&nbsp; Drop them and they become a bag on the ground.&nbsp; Now when you
    cast minor illusion and become the nearest object (the small bag) you are quite hard to be
    seen from a distance, especially in darker zones like the Faydark.&nbsp; Its also useful
    to note you can turn, cast and pick up objects without losing the spell effect.</p>
    <p>An interesting effect: if you are minor illusioned and are charmed by a monster, you
    may still be able to cast spells on others, but you will&nbsp; be unable to move from he
    spot thus your party members can flee if need be.&nbsp; This can prevent you from
    physically attacking other party members as well as preventing the monster charming you
    (an evil eye perhaps?) from sending you off after other targets. </td>
