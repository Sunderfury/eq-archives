    <td width="608" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">Illusions can help you make your way into
    places you are normally disliked.&nbsp; I seems that am npc's reaction to you is based
    upon the following factors.&nbsp; Your faction standing (based on what you kill), your
    race, your class and your religion.&nbsp; You can adjust faction standing by being
    selective about what you kill or don't kill.&nbsp; Later on you can also temporarily
    increase faction standing with spells like Alliance.&nbsp; it is with the Illusion series
    of spells you can adjust what race you appear to be to them.&nbsp; Most common uses for
    this affect are to allow passage through towns that consider your native race to be KOS
    (Kill on sight).&nbsp; A good example would be a drow/dark-elf attempting to walk thr
    streets of Felwithe. &nbsp; Provided they haven't been killing elves or things that lower
    their faction standing with the elves, this improves their chance of walking the streets
    without getting jumped by every guard and shop-keeper in sight.&nbsp; (what about class
    and religion?&nbsp; Well, we're stuck with those and can't fool people)<p>Some illusions
    also give benefits as if you were the race you appear to be.&nbsp; Examples would be
    improved healing rate, the ability to bash, etc.&nbsp; Wood elf&nbsp; seems to have no
    real benefit.</td>
