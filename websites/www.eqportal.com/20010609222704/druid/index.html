<I>A light, cool wind rustles through the trees. Wolves howl in the distance as night begins to fall. Leaves crackle underfoot as you stumble through the forest, completely lost and unaware of your direction. Clouds gather in the sky as lightning silently arcs to the ground far in the distance. The storm is approaching..<BR><BR>
Frantically, you race through the forest, trying in vain to find your way. Out of breath, you pause to sit down, leaning on a large stone monolith. As you are about to get up, several cloaked, hooded figures emerge from the forest..</I><BR><BR>
"Greetings weary traveler, you have journeyed into the lands of the <A HREF="druids.html">Druids of Tal Kor</A>, the Elven Nation of Norrath. We watch and protect these woods from those who would harm nature. Come, sit by our fire and stay awhile.."<BR><BR>
<I>Long into the night the druids talk, telling you of their <A HREF="overview.html">purpose</A> in Norrath, of <A HREF="stories.html">valiant deeds</A>, and of <A HREF="links.html">places far away</A>. In the morning you awaken to see no sign of them, but your pack is filled with food and supplies. Refreshed, you continue your journey..</I><BR><BR>
<B>Updates:</B><BR>
[09/08/99] It would seem there has been a lack of updates, but I will attempt to put up a new section and update current information.<BR><BR>
[07/14/99] Wrote up a brief guide to <A HREF="solusek.html">Solusek's Eye</A>, feel free to send anything else that should be in there. Also added a link to a very thorough description of the spells up to the 5th rank (19th level).<BR><BR>
[07/07/99] Added a link to <A HREF="http://www.shadowtech.net/eqdruids/">EQ Druids</A>, a very extensive site on everyone's favorite class. Also included a few of the larger, more general EQ news sites.<BR><BR>
[07/05/99] This site has very recently been created, and as you can tell it is not nearly complete, so feel free to send any material in relating to druids. The colour scheme needs to be changed, and a listing of spells is not yet in. And please visit our <A HREF="http://www.eqportal.com/forum/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Druids&number=4&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=">forum</A>, it is rather lonely in there..<BR><BR>
