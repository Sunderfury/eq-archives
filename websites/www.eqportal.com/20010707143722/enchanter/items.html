<p><strong>Enchanted Armor &amp; Weapons</strong></p>

<p>One of the original selling points of the enchanter class in Everquest was that we
would be able to make enchanted items.&nbsp; Alas, when the game finally did come out we
found that our ability to enchant was greatly hindered by the fact that there was nothing
enchantable nor spells for us to enchant with.&nbsp; The sole exception at the time, was
out ability to enchant bars of silver, electrum, gold and platinum from which magical
jewelry could be made.&nbsp; A nice little tid-bit, but not what we had hoped for.</p>

<p>After months of game play, and months of players bugging them to let enchanters make
enchanted items, Verant finally capitulated to our desires and has started adding
enchantable gear.&nbsp; So far there is only one item known, Wu's Fighting Gauntlets.
&nbsp; We would hope the list of what we can make should grow and, when it does, I'll
further divide these pages up so it is easier to find what to make and how.&nbsp; Until
then, here is the information on Wu's Fighting Gauntlets.</p>

<p><strong>Wu's Fighting Gauntlets<br>
</strong>Magic Item, AC: 4, WT: 0.1, Class: Monk, Race: Human<br>
Notes: They act as a light source as per greater light source.&nbsp; Allows monks to punch
for magical damage.<br>
<br>
How to make them:&nbsp; They require a master tailor (trivial level unknown at this time)
to combine:<br>
1 silk swatch, 1 greater lightstone, 1 glove pattern, 1 vial of viscous mana,&nbsp; &amp;
4 heady kiola into a large tailoring kit.&nbsp; The heady kiola must not be stacked, they
must be placed in seperate slots.<br>
<br>
