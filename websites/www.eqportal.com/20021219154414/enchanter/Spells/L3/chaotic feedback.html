    <td width="608" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">Our first true direct damage / blasting
    spell, chaotic feedback is also our first spell from the school of evocation.&nbsp; Some
    enchanters shun this at first due to a few valid reasons, though its the sort of spell
    that's worth casting once in any fight, particularly if you are soloing and have a pet.<p>What
    are its drawbacks?&nbsp; It is slow to cast.&nbsp; If you don't have something taunting
    your opponent off you, you will likely take damage and be disrupted more often than you
    will successfully cast this.&nbsp; It is also slow to recharge, you may only get one or
    two off in a fight if you are lucky enough to cast at all.&nbsp; Its also our first
    evocation spell so you will be very poor at it to begin with and may find it nearly
    impossible to cast in any battle where you will gain decent experience or reward for some
    time.</p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Most importantly this spell falls into a category most commonly
    refered to as a mega-taunt spell.</font>&nbsp; This means that the moment you hit
    something with this spell it will become more interested in you than even a horde of 10
    warriors beating it to a bloody pulp.&nbsp; Even though most things are concerned
    primarily with whoever is doing the most damage, your group of warriors can have done over
    50 damage each to the target and even with it resisting the spell and you doing about
    25-30 damage with this one spell it will turn on you.&nbsp; Worse, it becomes extremely
    difficult to taunt away from you now that you have its attention.</p>
    <p>There is one slight advantage to this.&nbsp; If you feel you are sturdy enough to
    withstand the pummeling you'll receive, this is an excellent way to get something's
    attention away from a very wounded party member.&nbsp; If you can time it right, since it
    is slow to cast, you can save lives by using this mega-taunt more effectively than even
    your warrior pals who have the actual taunt spell.</td>
