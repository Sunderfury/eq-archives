is your mose valued asset.&nbsp; Only the acclaimed Monk can go without a great
wealth of weaponry and armor.&nbsp; I have put together a collection here of all
the equipment and info I could find about each item.&nbsp; If you find anything
I've missed or have incorrect, please drop my a line and let me know so that I
can correct the error.</font></p>

        unfinished are grey for now and will change to red as they are
        finished.&nbsp; I hate leaving things unfinished like this, but my only
        other option was to eat into my own playing time... well, you know how
        that goes. :^)&nbsp; These will be fixed up ASAP I assure you.</font></td>
