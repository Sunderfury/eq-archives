<b>March 10, 2001 - Clockwork Breastplate made!</b><br>
<hr>
<p>For everyone who doesn't know, Meshugugget of Luclin has made the first <a href="bp.html" target="new_window">clockwork 
  watchman breastplate</a>! Grats go out to her and Kraket, Mutt, Wyrian and Sbik 
  for helping to gather components. She said it took about 30 attempts of vanishing 
  devices and breastplates for her to make one. She successfully made it with 
  a skill of 156.</p>
<p>Clockwork gauntlets have also been made, but I do not yet have a screenshot 
  of them. Wyzskarlet of Brell was the first person to make these and let anyone 
  know :) The gauntlets are a +30 strength buff. That means boots are going to 
  be dex.</p>
<p>Also, Knok Verst of the Karana server has informed me that Clockwork Watchman 
  Armor is activateable at level 20.</p>
<b>February 21, 2001 - Site updates</b><br>
<hr>
<p>Okey everyone, doing some site updates today, yay!</p>
<p>Mostly GPS and component locations were updated. Also, I have been informed 
  that Rebreathers are trivial at a skill of 177. Since this is the closest number 
  I have, I'm going to update the recipe section (I'm sorry to whoever e-mailed 
  me this, I can't find it anywhere.)</p>
<p>Also, I have heard from someone who parsed the spell data file that guantlets 
  and boots cast +30 strength buff and a +30 dex buff (Steam Overload and Mana 
  Infusion).. don't know which does which yet.</p>
<b>January 29, 2001 - Vanishing Device made!</b> 
<hr>
<p>It is my great pleasure to introduce the finished <a href="images/device.jpg" target=new_window>gnomish 
  vanishing device</a>! Thanks go out to Wyzskarlet of Brell Serilis, and to Krilan 
  for supplying the eye and keeping the finished product. This item was not trivial 
  at 154 skill. The item is what appears to be a secondary slot item, with 5 charges 
  of invisbility cloak. Also, the item appears to be ALL/ALL as well. I've added 
  a link in the recipe section to the stats of the item.</p>
<b>January 10, 2001 - Back to work!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Well, I've finally got a chance to do some updates.  The javascript errors for the Netscape users should be gone now.  There are a couple GPS updates, and I've added screenshots of the Clockwork Watchman Helmet to the recipes section (just click on the link).  Also, I will be updating the ingredients location page as soon as I get a chance.  I've been busy lately, and my internet connection has been so cheesy that I've been stuck in Hate for two weeks now :(  But, rest assured, that I will update it in the near future!</p>

<b>December 27, 2000 - Happy Holidays!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Happy holidays everyone!</p>
<p>I've made a few updates to the recipes page with the descovery of the clockwork 
  watchman armor. I'm still looking into the JavaScript problems that Netscape 
  users are experiencing, and I hope to fix it soon.</p>
<p>Also, I have updated the GPS.</p>
<p>Also, I have recieved many e-mails asking about the mailing list. I have posted 
  a link to the mailing list (EQ_Tinkering), where all you have to do is sign 
  up. I'm not running this list, but it seems to have a lot of members. So sign 
  up!</p>
<b>December 17, 2000 - Updates at last!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Finally got some updates up! Woohoo!</p>
<p>The new stuff from Velious has been added to the various sections of the site, 
  as well as quite a few GPS updates. The Community Posting has been re-made into 
  the link for the Forums. There is a link on the Links page to the old posting, 
  if anyone needs it for some reason.</p>
<p>I'll be getting back to doing updates. It's been hard without internet access, 
  but everything should be smooth once I get back to playing the game and getting 
  the expansion.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who sent me pictures and information from the new book. 
  I've been busy wading through the 200 emails I got from everyone (PLEASE remember 
  to resize your screenshots!)</p>
N<b>ovember 21, 2000 - Eeeeek!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Ok ok ok! Stop e-mailing meeeee!As many, many people have stated, that is crushed 
  diamond in TD, not diamond dust!</p>
<p>Small update today. I hope to update the GPS during the holiday weekend. </p>
<p>Included in the future enchancements, I'll be making a change to the pricing 
  for tinkering. I'll be including a high/low scale to show the price for tinkering 
  with 60 charisma, 100 charisma, and 150 charisma. A lot of people have been 
  asking for this, since we have such a low charisma. I've started a post on the 
  tinkering board called &quot;Tinkering Prices,&quot; so if anyone has information, 
  it'll make it a lot easier for me to update the pricing :)</p>
<p>Velious is fast approaching, hopefully some new tinkering stuff will come from 
  it :)</p>
<b>November 10, 2000 - Updates, updates, updates! </b> 
<hr>
<p>Wow, sorry for the long delay folks. I've been trapped inside Fulcrum's workshop 
  for almost a month. I went inside to find a couple notes for King Ak'Anon and 
  couldn't find my way out. Luckly a few Watchmen came by and helped me out:)</p>
<p>Quite a few updates today, mostly to the GPS. I have also been informed that 
  there is already a Tinkering mailing list, which you can find out more information 
  about here: <a href=http://www.egroups.com/group/EQ_Tinkering>http://www.egroups.com/group/EQ_Tinkering</a>.</p>
<p>Also, Dielzen of the Innoruuk server has informed me that Diamond Dust also 
  drops in Timorous Deep every twenty minutes next to Golra on the Golra Iceberg. 
  He said that the gorolas are mostly blue to a level 32 monk. I don't have a 
  loc for it, but will be posting one as soon as I get it.</p>
<b>October 17, 2000 - Site Updates and Mailing List Poll </b> 
<hr>
<p>I've updated the recipie section to include powered gloves and catapults. I 
  have posted a message on the forums asking if anyone wants a tinkering mailing 
  list. I've already recieved a few e-mails about people who want one, but I figured 
  that I'd put a message up on the boards, since some people bypass the site completely 
  :( </p>
<b>October 16, 2000 - Mailing List and other things </b> 
<hr>
<p>Ok, I'm not sure what happened to the mailing list, or even if it's still around, 
  but if anyone wants one let me know. If I get enough people interested I'll 
  start another one up.</p>
<p>I have also put a big warning on the community recipies page. Apparently, some 
  people were trying to make the items and posting why they didn't work. Keep 
  in mind the community posting page is for tinkering ideas, and do not currently 
  work in the game, nor may they ever work.</p>
<p>I'm also looking for a screenshot of powered gloves and a catapult so that 
  I can update the recipie sections. If anyone has them, send them to me please 
  :) </p>
<b>October 14, 2000 - Site Updates Coming Soon!</b> 
<hr>
<p>Greetings Everyone.As many of you know, Fulcrum is currently MIA. Since that 
  is the case, I am here to take over the tinkering Compendium. I am Dakirn Wigglesnout, 
  Gnome Warrior extrordinare of the Tunare server. Some of you may already know 
  me, some of you do not, but I'm going to do my best to keep this site going.</p>
<p>You'll notice quite a few changes over the next few weeks. I plan to change 
  the website a little to make it prettier. If you anyone has suggestions for 
  the site, please feel free to e-mail me at <a href=mailto:dakirn@tinkering.org>dakirn@tinkering.org.</a></p>
<p>Also, I have registered the domain name <a href=http://www.tinkering.org>www.tinkering.org</a> 
  to make it easier for some people to access the site. Since there is a tinkering 
  upgrade planned for around the time of the Velious expansion, I figured that 
  it'd be easier for people to remember that way =)</p>
<p>The forums will be staying the same, I like them and didn't want to touch 'em.Change 
  is not always painless, but hopefully we'll be able to pull together as a community 
  to make this new site the premiere tinkering information on the internet!</p>
