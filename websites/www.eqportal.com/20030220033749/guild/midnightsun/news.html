	</strong></em><font color="#AE5700" size="2"><em><strong>
As you all know we've lost a lot of our main memebers the last few days. :( I will not state names because you probably know who I am talking about. It kind of kicked MSun in the butt. Ladihawk made a post... and think it's good for eveyone to see. </p>
"Long ago a discussion went around as to what did we as a guild want to head for in the future. Back then very few wanted to do raids but then again very few had done any. Now with all the cool zones and super cool loot and more and more of us went there to explore and learned that raids can be fun. Just a short time before our members started raiding with allies DAoC came out and we lost alot to it. Many had returned home but some never did. Many of us have tried to do what the members wanted but it seemed very few members knew what they wanted to do or cared to do it.</p>

We will see many of our friends leave in the near future and we will miss them all. This split is not like the guilds that disband due to hostility or ingame fighting and bickering. Our family is going away peacefully and i hope with their heads held high for there is no shame in wanting to better ones self. If that takes having to leave us for a larger more organized guild then who am i to say "stay we can work it out"? </p>

I have already started thinking of ways to change or reorganize those of us that remains after this split. We went quite awhile since the last major split  </p>

I also extend an invitation to those leaving to remember us and come by anytime to visit. We will leave the porchlight on so even though you well know the way you will also know we welcome your return whether it be for a cool drink or just sit in the easy chairs on the porch and talk of your new lives."</p>
