    <td width="149" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">Tips:</td>
    <td width="608" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">This is the first in a series of such
    spells.&nbsp; The target can not resist, so feel free to use it frequently on shop
    keepers.&nbsp; The spell is most commonly used to sell your goods for a slightly better
    price or to buy supplies at a slightly lower price.&nbsp; There is, however, a litmit to
    how good a price you will receive and once you reach it this spell won't affect the
    pricing any.<p>Adding faction standing can have other beneficial affects.&nbsp; Some
    quests are not available to you until you reach a cetain faction standing.&nbsp; This
    spell only adds a limited amount, but it may make the difference.&nbsp; Some beings will
    also attack you if your faction standing with them is low enough, this may also make the
    difference between being attacked and being merely sneered at.</p>
    <p>The duration on this spell seems to last a while.&nbsp; The best way to tell is compare
    shop prices before and after casting it.&nbsp; The duration seems to be over 5 minutes for
    the most part, long enough to run back and forth between shop keepers when performing
    tasks like buying trade-good supplies, creating trade-good items to increase skill, and
    then selling back to regain some of the monetary cost and start over.&nbsp; I've managed
    to run through several platinum and quite a long &quot;training&quot; period while only
    casting this spell once.</p>
    <p>Zoning seems to remove the affects.&nbsp; Raising faction standing affects not only the
    target, but their entire factions opinion of you.</td>
