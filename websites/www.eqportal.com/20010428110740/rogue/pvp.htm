<p><font color="#996633" size="3">With the advent of the RaceWar servers, PvP has really brought on a new
flavor.&nbsp; This section will be divided into three parts.&nbsp; The first is
for <a href="#Blue Server PvP:">Blue Server PvP</a>, the second for <a href="#Race War Server PvP:">Race
War PvP</a>, and the third will the the infamous <a href="#Rallos Zek PvP:">Rallos
Zek PvP</a>.&nbsp; The divisions are so because strategies can vary considerable
depending on the environment.</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="Blue Server PvP:"><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Blue Server
PvP:</font></a></p>
<p><font color="#996633" size="3">Being PvP on a normal blue server can be both exciting and
dissapointing.&nbsp; For one, other players who are blue can't help you out
directly very much, and many hold a certain distaste for you simply because you
are PvP.&nbsp; These are the people who think PvP is against role-playing, but I
would argue that with them.&nbsp; Killing other people is part of what people
do.&nbsp; For gaming purposes, I feel it can make for great sport, and a
challenge like no other you will find in the game.</font></p>
<p><font color="#996633" size="3">The exciting part about going PvP on a blue server is the fact that there are
so few of you out there.&nbsp; Count on no more than 2 dozen people of all the
1500+ that regularly sign on to that server being PvP, but look closely at
EVERYONE!&nbsp; As you journey through Norrath fighting, looting, buying and
selling, all will seem perfectly normal.&nbsp; Then one day you'll open a door
and &quot;GASP!!!! A RED!!!!&quot;.&nbsp; Your pulse pounds as you scramble to
pull up your combat screen, click on them, con them, turn invisible..... Who are
they?&nbsp; Have they seen you?&nbsp; Can they see invisible?&nbsp; Will they
kill you?&nbsp; You finally get a con on them..... and they're EVEN!!!&nbsp; As
a Wood Elf rogue it quickly dawns on you that a wretched Dark-Elf scum stands
before you, so engrossed with the merchant that he didn't even see you... and
with cat like precision you drive your dagger into his back!&nbsp; He is numb
for second, wondering what just happend, just long enough for you to swap
weapons and begin meleeing him to death.&nbsp; The evil necro tries to fire off
a few spells, one lands and burns a bit, but without his precious pet you
dispatch him quickly...</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><font color="#996633">Well, that's my big line for going &quot;Red&quot; on a blue server.&nbsp;
Take it or leave it.&nbsp; Here's just a few tips and general things to know
when PvP'ing on a blue server.</font><br>
<font color="#0000FF">1)</font>  <font color="#CC0000">Keep a list of all people
you run into who are red.&nbsp; Write down the name, class, race, and level if
you can get it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever you zone and/or periodically while in a zone, do a
/who all on them and make sure they aren't around if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're close enough in level.</font><font color="#FF0000"><br>
</font><font color="#0000FF">2)</font>  <font color="#CC0000">Find a way to make
friends with one, you'll need them.&nbsp; Giving them stuff could do it, perhaps
simple logic, but you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEED a friend.</font> <font color="#FF0000"><br>
</font><font color="#0000FF">3)</font>  <font color="#CC0000">Stay invisible as
much as possible, if you have SoW keep it on constantly.</font> <font color="#FF0000"><br>
</font><font color="#0000FF">4)</font>  <font color="#CC0000">Check your other
camera angles regularly, while in combat and not.&nbsp; Knowing they are there
before they strike may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be your only chance of survival.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><font color="#996633">The racewar server has brought a
whole new style of playing to the PvP scene.&nbsp; Now, as many of you know, the
races of Norrath are divided into four teams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#CC0000">Team 1 =
Humans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Barbarians&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erudites<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Team 2 = Wood Elf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High
Elf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half Elf<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Team 3 = Dark Elf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Troll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ogre<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Team 4 =
Gnome&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Halfling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwarf</font><font color="#996633" size="4"><br>
Conveniently for rogues, we can be on any of these teams without suffering a
huge penalty because of our wide variety of races.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#996633" size="3">Many people argue that this is
THE most fun style of PvP play, and with good reason.&nbsp; You get to kill
those other races that always annoy you, there's an 8 level differential to PvP,
and you get that whole group morale/team thing that gives you a sense of
purpose.</font></p>

If you're going to be an elf, you're going to have to get REAL used to Crushbone
and plan to spend a LOT of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time there.&nbsp; It's really the only place you can go
to level from about level 8 on, unless you are brave enough
to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leave your other elven brethren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font color="#996633" size="4"><br>
</font><font size="4" color="#0000FF">3) </font><font size="4" color="#CC0000">Elves
don't have a safe dock to get to Antonica.&nbsp; To some, this could be a good
enough reason to be a Human or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbarian rogue, just so that you will have ready access to
all the fruits of Antonica at the lower levels.</font></font></p>
