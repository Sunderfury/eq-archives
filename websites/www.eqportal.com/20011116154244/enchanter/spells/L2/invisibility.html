    <td width="608" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">Coupled with <a href="gate.html"
    target="_self">gate</a>, this makes an enchanter one of the best early explorers in the
    game.&nbsp; Enchanters get invisibility earlier than the other classes and can get around
    quite nicely with it.&nbsp; To test this out, I spent a fair deal of time exploring
    HighPass when I hit level 4 and first aquired invisibility, just to see how effective it
    was, and I had no problems.<p>Invisibility is also very useful when recovering
    corpses.&nbsp; Although fighting and looting corpses removes invisibility, using the
    /corpse command does not.&nbsp; If you died in an area that is somewhat dangerous, you can
    go in invisibly and drag your corpse to a safer location with /corpse before looting
    it.&nbsp; You can even grant invisibility to others (provided you are grouped with them)
    so they can recover their own corpses in this manner.</p>
    <p>As nice as it is there are only a few minor drawbacks to invisibility.&nbsp; For one
    thing, undead aren't fooled by it so don't bother trying to sneak past undead while
    invisible.&nbsp; Some high level mobs can see right through invisibility too.&nbsp; A good
    way to determine if you can be seen is to /con the mob in question before approaching it.
    &nbsp; While invisible, all mobs that can't see you /con as indifferent to you.&nbsp; If
    you get any other message, amiable or ready to attack for example, then the mob can quite
    clearly see you.</p>
    <p>A word of caution with Invisibility and pets.&nbsp; Pets need to be able to see you or
    they think you've zoned and they destroy themselves.&nbsp; Casting invisibility on
    yourself while you have a pet is in the area will cause the pet to destroy itself.&nbsp;
    If the pet happens to be one you captured via a charm spell, they don't just go away, they
    break the charm spell and attack you just as you go invisible making you visible again and
    suddenly in a fight.&nbsp; Finally, its duration is somewhat variable.&nbsp; Although it
    typically lasts a good long while for me it can sometimes last a few seconds.&nbsp; The
    duration seems to range from about 1 seconds to about 20 minutes.&nbsp; In addition to the
    variable duration, it doesn't always give any warning before going away it simply wears
    off.&nbsp; Usually its icon will blink before it goes away, but once in a while it will
    simply just go away.</td>
