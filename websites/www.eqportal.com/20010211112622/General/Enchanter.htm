      <p> Enchanters are probably the hardest class to play. Even the game designers 
        seem to be confused on what Enchanters can do and how they work. The official 
        word is that thier role is to Enchant poeple, places and things. Only 
        1 spell is known to enchant a place (Sentinel) and the only thing they 
        can Enchant is metal bars for the making of Jewelry. They have the lowest 
        offensive punch and the weakest defenses of all classes. So if Verant 
        does not have the answer then what can an Enchanter do and do well? In 
        combat they work best at changing the circumstances and pacing of a fight. 
        They can confuse or charm a monster and speed up or slow down the combatants. 
        If the party has to run the Enchanter can most assure them of a succesful 
        escape (Druids are admittedly better in some circumstances). They have 
        the best buffing and debuffing abilities of this group though are not 
        as strong as Bards or Wis based casters. Where an Enchanter really excells 
        is out of combat. They are the best Tradesman in all of Norrath. With 
        decent starting Int to quickly learn a craft and the Cha to buy and sell 
        at good prices this should be obvious. Going beyond this however they 
        have the ability to assume the guise of any PC race and modify factions 
        and thier Charisma so that they can reliably buy and sell at the best 
        rates anywhere in Norrath. </p>
