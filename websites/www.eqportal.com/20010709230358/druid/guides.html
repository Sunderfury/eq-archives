A druid is a jack-of-all-trades, making hunting in Norrath very flexible. No matter what classes make up a group, a druid should <I>always</I> have a useful role. We may not have the damage potential of wizards, nor the more powerful healing and defensive capabilities of a cleric, but there is always that niche to be filled in even the most balanced party. Snaring, healing, and fetching may be best for a spellcasting group. Otherwise, it may be best to focus on damage shields for the fighters while casting either attack or healing spells (once again depending on what classes make up the party). Every hunting spot is different, but our abilities and spells should supplement almost any party in any situation.<BR><BR>
