<p>Further news: Have you been to the Sony Everquest site lately?<br>
  The new webmaster has redone the links so the whole site is now MUCH more useable. 
  Previously you had to do a lot more hunting around and people were complaining 
  they could not find information that was there. With this change the need for 
  specific links is gone so I have removed them.</p>
<p> I have found a site some of you have seen before, but those who have not should 
  defiantely look up. The <a href="http://longroad.mpog.com/">Long Road</a> is 
  a site that is a very Role Playing oriented site of Quest info and some journals.</p>
<p>Also <a href="http://www.eqportal.com/eqguise/">EQGuise</a> is picking up some 
  rather interesting items.....</p>
<p>I am looking for non-English webmasters who would be interested in translating 
  certain pages for making life in EQ for those people who do not read english 
  easier. If your interested in either running your own site or translating a 
  few pages of special tips and contact information please drop me a line. Thank 
  you. </p>

<p align="left"><b>This idea was brought forth by Stonedreamer of Fenin Ro who 
  recognized that there are many sites out there with good information and advice 
  but that sometimes finding these sites was hard and time consuming. As the Library 
  of his home in Ak'anon once did he has sought out authors far and wide and attempted 
  to bring many of them under one roof so all can benefit. Classes can talk to 
  and learn from others who share their spells and skills. We can see what our 
  traveling companions needs and abilities are from their peers and share with 
  them what we need and can offer. Thus EQPortal has been created in the spirit 
  of Teamwork.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Those who have their sites here are hoping to benefit more 
  then just their Class, Race or Trade much less themselves and should be commended. 
  Stonedreamer and Refplace in no way assumes credit for their hard work. We merely 
  provide a building for them to gather in.</b></p>
