</FONT><HR>Enchanter Spell Review (LONG) <BR>by Zamtil Litmaz - Veeshan <BR>                                                                           posted 5/20/99 10:59:29 PM <P><BR>Here's my thoughts and suggestions on the Enchanter class after <BR>reaching Level 50. Let's start with the recent controversy over <BR>Whirl. It was too powerful prior to the patch; however, it's been <BR>gimped beyond use now (Color Flux & Shift are much better, however <BR>they are Area Effect). Clerics and Wizards both still have single <BR>target stun spells with fixed durations, yet the class whose <BR>responsible for damage control doesn't? <P>Recent posts suggest Whirl was gimped because of a Cleric & Enchanter <BR>combo taking down mobs that would normally require a full group. <BR>This doesn't make alot of sense, because a Cleric & Enchanter combo <BR>still relies on Root & Nuke, not melee which is where Whirl is <BR>useful. The main party I was with for levels 40 to 50 consisted of <BR>myself, a cleric, 2 rogues, and normally 2 druids. Yes, we took down <BR>mobs all the way up to level 50. Yes, Whirl allowed the rogues to <BR>backstab like mad; however, it was never full proof, when Whirl was <BR>resisted, the rogues took a beating, we just had plenty of healing <BR>power. <P>Verant seems to expect multiple groups to work together, when <BR>organizing a single group of 6 can take an hour already. I can just <BR>imagine the groups competing to do the most damage so they get the <BR>loot and XP. If the high level mobs are supposed to take 12 people <BR>(or more) Verant needs to provide a way to make larger groups. As <BR>is, on a nightly basis, myself or another friend is getting booted <BR>due to the 6 person limit -- great social aspect.<P>I'll be focusing almost entirely on the Enchanter class with my <BR>ideas, because that's what I've played. I know every class has <BR>problems needing solutions.<P>Now, let's review the Enchanter spell book ... let me just mention <BR>that at level 50, I finally got my level 24 Tepid Deeds spell. Spell <BR>components are still too rare, I'll end up with 5 right sides of a <BR>page and 0 lefts.<P>Choke Series, Damage over Time (DoT) ... my biggest complaint is that <BR>our Strength debuffs and DoTs overlap, so for the most part the <BR>Strength debuff is useless, since a little more mana does damage, as <BR>well as, debuff. <P>Brain Melt Series, Direct Damage ... I can't complain about this. I'd <BR>MUCH rather have full damage when a spell hits, then deal with <BR>partial damage resists. I keep my DD memorized for emergencies, but <BR>rarely cast it, mostly because I'm too busy trying to control the <BR>battle. Naturally I use it when I solo .. Root & Nuke.<P>Tashan(i), great spells, too bad the higher level version was missing <BR>for so long. It does make a difference, just let the melee guys do <BR>some damage before you debuff the mob though. =)<P>Mesmerize Series ... probably our best set of spells, unfortunatly <BR>the most useful one is Level 4 Mesmerize, because it casts so fast. <BR>Our AE Mesmerization is OK, but as long as you have tanks and clerics <BR>to take the blows, the single target spells are the best bet. As it <BR>stands, AE is generally only useful if you want to commit suicide.<P>Charm Series ... well, they were cool at first, but their reliability <BR>leaves alot to be desired. The bard charm song seems alot more <BR>useful because the duration is basically fixed AND they can continue <BR>to re-charm since it requires no mana. Without tanks, charm is <BR>great; with tanks, just mesmorize and save the pain. Best use for <BR>Charm - Charm Sand Giants on each other and let the crowd in Oasis <BR>place their bets.<P>Shadow Series ... great ... unless there's a cleric handy. Even <BR>still ours are more mana efficient, just a few less AC points.<P>Strengthen Series ... doesn't make alot of sense. Our first <BR>(Strengthen) is a long-lasting buff and quite useful at the lower <BR>levels. Our higher level Strength buffs are Combat Duration only so <BR>a relatively poor use of mana in comparison to a Druids or Shamans. <BR>Same thing goes for Augmentation (AGI Buff) ... good spell, duration <BR>too short. Intelligence buff at higher levels rocks, Charisma buffs <BR>probably help Charm but are best for getting better NPC prices.<P>Endure Magic buffs ... great, but again Cleric can cast everything <BR>but Group Resist Magic (Level 49).<P>Animation Series ... pets. I know Verant intends these as Shields <BR>and not a true pet, but something has to be done to keep them <BR>leashed. They're fine to use killing crocodiles in Oasis, but almost <BR>guaranteed to cause trains in dungeons. My suggestion is to give <BR>them a fixed roam range around the caster. This way if the caster <BR>doesn't chase the fleeing mob, neither does the pet.<P>Ally Series ... does anyone even know what these were intended to do? <BR>My idea for this Series is to raise faction on the target ... so this <BR>becomes a PC buff not an NPC debuff. This would become an alternate <BR>method of sneaking through green trash in zones (if you've tried it <BR>with invisible or invisible to undead...). Only problem is some zones <BR>have multiple factions, so how do you choose the right one to raise? <P>Taper Enchantment Series ... these would be great if players could <BR>dispel the NPCs like they dispel us. Otherwise, not worth keeping <BR>memorized. Burn spam from NPC with damage shields cast on them is <BR>very annoying.<P>Rune Series (Wizard Shieldskin Series) ... these spells are very <BR>pricey for their limited duration. Clerics use the same components <BR>and add hitpoints which can be healed. Good for solo'ing, but cleric <BR>buffs and heals are better in a group.<P>Enchant Metal Series ... Hahahaha, jewelry deserves an entirely <BR>seperate rant.<P>Fear Series ... not a whole lot of use, since the mob will bring back <BR>a train in most places. Fun to use on town guards though.<P>Memory Wipe Series ... amazingly enough, I never really used these <BR>alot. Normally just kept extra mobs mesmerized until it's their time <BR>to die. Quickness Series ... melee types love these, extremely long <BR>cast times and high mana costs for such short duration buffs though.<P>Illusion Series ... big problem here is mobs see through illusions <BR>due to Diety choices. A troll worshipping Brell just doesn't seem to <BR>cut it. At most, illusions seem to knock off one level of bad <BR>faction - if frogs in Guktop look at me threateningly in gnome form, <BR>they'll look at me dubiously as an Earth Elemental. If Druids can <BR>have a Pack Illusion, then an Enchanter certainly deserves them as <BR>well.<P>Whirl ... needs to become a Series spell, perhaps as part of the Fear <BR>Series. As I mentioned, mobs running around zones bringing back <BR>trains is pointless. Enchanters deserve a fixed duration stuns more <BR>than any other class. Durations should be based on casters Charisma <BR>plus mob's resist, but the maximum durations for the series should be <BR>3 seconds, 6 seconds, then 9 seconds around 44th level. Mana costs <BR>would be 35, 55, then 75. Cycle times on these s<BR>(HE was cut off here by that boards software so posted this reply to conitinue)<BR>Whirl ... needs to become a Series spell, perhaps as part of the Fear <BR>Series. As I mentioned, mobs running around zones bringing back <BR>trains is pointless. Enchanters deserve a fixed duration stuns more <BR>than any other class.

Mana costs <BR>would be 35, 55, then 75. Cycle times on these spells needs to be <BR>duration x 2. The mob needs to actually SPIN, so rogues don't get <BR>free backstabs. Other stuns overriding Whirl is fine; however, the <BR>random break due to MELEE hits has to go. Random = 0 duration when <BR>you have multiple melee fighters hitting the mob.<P>That's it. Just got cut off a little short. =)<p>[This message has been edited by Stonedreamer (edited 05-21-99).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://www.eqportal.com/forum/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000006&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.eqportal.com/forum/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000006&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
