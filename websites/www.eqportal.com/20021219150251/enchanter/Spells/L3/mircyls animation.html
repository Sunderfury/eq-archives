    <td width="609" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">The first pet we receive that has definite combat
    value.&nbsp; It can frequently do more damage than warriors your level, frequently has a
    good armor, heals very fast after combat and does an effective job of taunting your
    attacker away from you during combat (provided you do not cast a mega-taunt spell like <a
    href="chaotic%20feedback.html" target="_self">Chaotic Feedback</a>) leaving you free to
    cast your spells in relative safety.<p>By judicious use of <a href="../l2/fear.html"
    target="_self">Fear</a> and damage over time (DoT) spells, like <a
    href="../l2/suffocating%20sphere.html" target="_self">Suffocating Sphere</a>, you can find
    this pet is quite effective.&nbsp; Pets can do one thing far better than players, which is
    run and hit things without lagging.&nbsp; However, this pet may be sufficiently strong
    enough that you are not limited to this.&nbsp; A good many enchanters also allow their pet
    to stand toe-to-toe with the target at this level while they judiciously use debuffs, DoT
    spells, and direct damage spells to finish it off.</p>
    <p>The thing to be aware of with this pet is that its strengths are now variable enough
    that you may receive a variety from significantly weaker to equal to your own strength via
    /con.&nbsp; Some enchanters use <a href="../L1/reclaim%20energy.html" target="_self">reclaim
    energy</a> to destroy weaker pets and continue re-summoning new ones until they receive a
    sufficiently powerful one, however, given the cost of three tiny daggers and limited
    carrying space this may not be cost-efficient for you yet.&nbsp; Do not lose heart though
    as your next level pet only costs a single tiny dagger to summon.</p>
    <p>Words of caution, unlike normal pets these can not be commanded to attack or defend
    you.&nbsp; They are not true pets in that sense, rather, they will defend you after you
    first take damage.&nbsp; Unless you take damage in a fight it will not aid in combat, so
    if grouped with others and you want your pet to help you need to get hit at least once.</p>
    <p>Perhaps a bug, perhaps intentional, but if you allow your pet to get the killing blow
    it takes&nbsp; portion of the experience from the kill.&nbsp; If you, or a group member,
    gets the killing blow your animated pet does not seem to take a share of the experience
    from the split.</td>
