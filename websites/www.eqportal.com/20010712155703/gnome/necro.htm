        Necromancy</b></font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">As you walk down the hallway, you have an odd feeling about yourself. It's<br>
        almost a mix between giddiness and shear terror. You pass a large scroll on<br>
        the wall. In large lettering, in what you immediately recognize as Gnomish,<br>
        then in Common in smaller lettering, it reads: PLEASE, no druids or paladins<br>
        beyond this point. Their auras disturb the delicate miracles I perform here<br>
        for my research. Also, no pets (charmed or otherwise), animals, or light<br>
        contagions. Large races must be shrunk before going further. Do not disturb<br>
        any experimentation in progress.&nbsp;<br>
        After a short hesitation, you enter the workshop. You shiver slightly at the<br>
        chill temperature maintained here. The air is filled with a musty, mildewy<br>
        smell which you aren't sure if you want to identify. One wall is covered by<br>
        a huge contraption covered in a light frost, making a continuous hissing<br>
        noise. The wall to your right has shelves full of various sized glass<br>
        containers. A sign above them reads (once again in Gnomish first, then in<br>
        Common): Virulent Diseases and Contagions - Handle with EXTREME care! You<br>
        WILL be held liable upon breakage. The wall to your left is covered in<br>
        shelves filled with new and ancient texts. Books, scrolls, and papyruses are<br>
        organized as neatly as possible to avoid any damage.&nbsp;<br>
        It's the table in the center, though, that truly catches your eye. A dead<br>
        aviak in an advanced state of decay is chained tightly down. After moving<br>
        closer to inspect it you realize that it's not dead at all. It writhes<br>
        slowly as if in pain for a few seconds, then stops. The moment it does, a<br>
        frustrated cry from behind lets you know you're not alone. You quickly turn<br>
        around to see Zinbik who's now screaming at you, "Can't you read Common?! It<br>
        took me months to bring unlife into this specimen and you run up to it like<br>
        a curious child and remind it of the natural cycle of life and death. Aviaks<br>
        don't cling to life like a normal humanoid. They... oh what would you know<br>
        anyway?"<br>
        He sighs and pulls a lever on the contraption you noticed earlier. After a<br>
        great deal of noise, part of it begins to open up. A great, freezing mist<br>
        falls out and reveals a compartment about the size of the body on the table.<br>
        The frustrated gnome proceeds to lift up one side of the top (removable)<br>
        portion of the table, then stops and looks at you expectantly. Trying to<br>
        avoid angering him any more you run to the other side and lift. The two of<br>
        you then proceed to lift up the body (still chained to the slab you're<br>
        carrying it on), carry it to the contraption, and slide it into the<br>
        compartment. With the pull of a second lever it closes back up and continues<br>
        it's hissing.<br>
        "So why do you disturb me in the first place?" Zinbik asks you with some<br>
        annoyance. Your response lets loose a great deal of laughter from the<br>
        necromancer. After regaining control over himself he amusingly responds,<br>
        "You want to know of the Dark Arts? You want to enter the fold and learn<br>
        some necromancy? Well, I suppose you've came to the right place. I don't<br>
        claim to be an expert but I've mastered quite a few of the skills involved.<br>
        I've also amassed plenty of information on the subject."&nbsp;<br>
        He waves you over to two small chairs in a corner of the room. You each take<br>
        a seat as he continues. "Well, where should I start? Ah, I know: race. There<br>
        are five races known to practice necromancy: Gnomes, Dark Elves, Erudites,<br>
        Humans, and the Iksar. Some may have their opinions as to who makes the best<br>
        necromancers, but the truth is, a master is a master. If you could choose<br>
        the race you were born with, it'd simply be a matter of taste and the way<br>
        you plan on living your life. Let me first discuss Humans.<br>
        "Humans start out as blind as a bat and not much smarter. Both human cities<br>
        have local necromancer infestations, but their styles differ greatly. So<br>
        close to Neriak, the Dismal Rage of Freeport follows Innoruuk. Far from such<br>
        influences though, the Blood Sabers of Qeynos have learned to follow<br>
        Bertoxxulous. Either way, human necromancers are generally forced to live<br>
        out life trying to get people to overcome their initial hatred of them.<br>
        Otherwise they must stick to the shadows when sneaking through dangerous<br>
        territory and travel far to sell their collected wares."<br>
        OOC: Humans lack any gift of sight and their starting stats are...average.<br>
        But this is just as viable a race as any other. At level 8 you'll get the<br>
        spell Deadeye (infravision and see invisible) which you'll have to keep<br>
        active in order to see decently until you get to 24, when you get Shadow<br>
        Sight (ultravision). Intelligence-increasing items will be what you fill<br>
        your inventory with to get rid of your initial stupidity. Factions are<br>
        tricky with humans. They start out with a lot of enemies, but they won't be<br>
        as KOS as a Dark Elf, for instance. Humans are supposed to level faster, but<br>
        Verant won't validate this. It's all a matter of choice and play-style. But<br>
        this is probably best suited for someone who wants to start out in one of<br>
        these specific cities or for role-playing purposes.<br>
        <br>
        Default Stats: Agi: 75, Cha: 75, Dex: 85, Int: 85, Sta: 75, Str: 75, Wis:<br>
        75, 30 points for allocation. Suggested point placement would probably be 25<br>
        (the maximum) points in Int and 5 points in Agi.<br>
        "Erudites start out just as blind, but at least they're smart old boys from<br>
        the start! Also, their native city of Paineel is a necromancer paradise.<br>
        Founded by necromancers, maintained by necromancers, frequented by<br>
        necromancers, this town is great. If it weren't out in the middle of nowhere<br>
        (Odus) I'd visit more often. Erudites start out with plenty of local<br>
        enemies. Also, you're gonna have to wait till you can use the spell Gather<br>
        Shadows or make a nice friend out of a passing druid or wizard if you want<br>
        to leave this dinky little island. Luckily there's creatures enough to<br>
        entertain you until then. I also must admit that these guys look the best in<br>
        a Robe of Enshroudment, but that's just my opinion."<br>
        OOC: Erudites also lack any gift of sight but at least they start out pretty<br>
        smart. They aren't much in many other stats, but hey, you can take care of<br>
        that later. Since you start out that smart you won't need nearly as many<br>
        intelligence-increasing items. This means you can worry about stuff like<br>
        strength (to carry more loot with). Faction is tricky with these guys. It's<br>
        either a lot of mana spent on invisibility or a lot of time spent fixing<br>
        factions. I've heard that these guys get some sort of experience penalty but<br>
        that's just hearsay. This seems best suited for someone who really<br>
        appreciates Paineel, wants to start with a nice foothold in intelligence, or<br>
        doesn't want to care about faction at all. This is because plenty of people<br>
        aren't willing to spend much time fixing factions. So once you're at this<br>
        point you might as well enjoy the privilege of killing whatever you want.<br>
        You'll always be welcome in one city, despite it's remote location.<br>
        Default Stats: Agi: 70, Cha: 70, Dex: 80, Int: 117, Sta: 70, Str: 60, Wis:<br>
        83, 30 points for allocation. For point placement I'd suggest 15 points in<br>
        Int, 10 points in Agi, and 5 points in Str.<br>
        "Dark Elves tend to be known as the most common race for necromancers.<br>
        Native to the grand city of Neriak, they are the children and avid followers<br>
        of Innoruuk. As members of the most respected profession for their race,<br>
        they're more than welcome in their home town. They're even appreciated by<br>
        those stupid ogres and trolls. Of course this means that anyone with the<br>
        slightest idea of goodness will instantly wish for your death. But hey,<br>
        these guys look GREAT in a blighted robe!"<br>
        OOC: This is the one race who doesn't have to wait till 24 for Ultravision.<br>
        They start out with pretty nice stats too. Neriak is also a great town with<br>
        a great location. The only problem (if you want to call it that) is faction.<br>
        Most use this to their advantage. After all, this means you can kill<br>
        whatever you want. You'll be spending a lot of times hidden in the shadows<br>
        though. And you either have to always have a friend to sell for you or be<br>
        willing to make some long treks for the nearest friendly vendor. This race<br>
        is best suited for someone who wants to start out powerful, kill whatever<br>
        they please, and/or role play a typical arch-villain.<br>
        Default Stats: Agi: 90, Cha: 60, Dex: 85, Int: 109, Sta: 65, Str: 60, Wis:<br>
        83, 30 points for allocation. Suggested point placement is 25 points in Int<br>
        and 5 points in Agi.<br>
        Zinbik leans back in his chair and grins at you, "If you want to see a real<br>
        necromancer though, find a gnome. We aren't so consumed by hate or fear to<br>
        have a good time. The politics of Ak'Anon are a bit tricky to understand for<br>
        an outsider, but our brethren don't hate us of the Dark Reflection. They<br>
        merely find some distaste in our company. Steamfont is also the best place I<br>
        can think of to start practicing your powers. The only problem is tricky<br>
        faction. You have a choice: hanging in the shadows or taking some time to<br>
        get people to like you. Not many people will ever love you, but it won't<br>
        take much work just to get them to let you live. It'll save you mana, time,<br>
        and careless deaths in the future."<br>
        OOC: They start with infravision, decent stats, and a nice starting spot<br>
        (Faydwer is great for the beginning levels, though technically you could<br>
        stay here forever). Like Erudites they play the faction game. With a couple<br>
        dead Crushbone Orcs, RunneyEye Goblins, and Highpass Orcs, most of the<br>
        people that hated you will at least let you pass. The problems are A.)<br>
        Verant doesn't seem to care for them. There isn't a single quest to be had<br>
        for the Dark Reflection. And B.) Some people don't respect the smallest race<br>
        in Norrath (being them or looking down at them). This race is best suited<br>
        for those who love starting on Faydwer, want a nice average-starting<br>
        necromancer, or for role playing reasons.<br>
        Default Stats: Agi: 85, Cha: 60, Dex: 95, Int: 108, Sta: 70, Str: 60, Wis:<br>
        67, 30 points for allocation. Suggested point placement is 25 points in Int<br>
        and 5 points in Agi.<br>
        "Finally, we come to the Iksar. I must say, these guys have some incredible<br>
        inborn abilities. They're excellent swimmers from childhood, they regenerate<br>
        as fast as trolls (a great advantage when it comes to the Dark Pact spell<br>
        line), they can forage an endless supply of food, and they possess<br>
        infravision. Other than that though, they start out as dumb as humans do and<br>
        only their own people will accept their presence. This excludes them from<br>
        countless quests and makes hunting on three entire continents an extreme<br>
        challenge. A member of the Brood of Kotiz spends almost their entire life<br>
        lurking in the shadows."<br>
        OOC: Excellent starting abilities, all your spells in a single zone, and<br>
        some decent stats (besides intelligence) make these guys at least decent.<br>
        But that lack of intelligence, inability to so much as enter the Temple of<br>
        Solusek Ro, and the fact that you can't easily leave Kunark makes things<br>
        really difficult. Expect your divination skills to be constantly maxed since<br>
        you're only ever safe in Cabalis. And if you want all those nice non-Kunark<br>
        items, you better start saving your platinum or preparing a deadly trek<br>
        across the world. This race is best suited to someone who truly wants a<br>
        challenge. Even dark elves can get around semi-decently in two continents.<br>
        And finally, Iksar look really weird in robes.<br>
        Default Stats: Agi: 90, Cha: 55, Dex: 95, Int: 85, Sta: 70, Str: 70, Wis:<br>
        80, 30 points for allocation. Suggested point placement is 25 points in Int<br>
        and 5 points in Str or Agi.<br>
        The necromancer pauses a moment, then continues while picking some lint off<br>
        his robes, "Starting out is basically the same for all professions. Find<br>
        your guild and therefore your new guildmaster and submit your note of<br>
        admittance. Be sure to have him train you in the way of piercing as much as<br>
        possible before you leave him. Now put on your robes, equip your dagger,<br>
        memorize your spells, and head for the nearest newbie grounds. For Dark<br>
        Elves and Humans this is right outside the gates to their home towns. For<br>
        Erudites this is up the elevator, down the path past the hole, and into the<br>
        newbie valley area. For Gnomes this is out the gates and to the left. Kill<br>
        everything of equal skill to you. As soon as you hear that magical 'ding'<br>
        that tells you you've advanced in your level of skill, be sure to sell all<br>
        you found on your kills. Then buy all the new spells you have money to buy.<br>
        "Now one mistake most young necromancers make is to grab the Cavorting Bones<br>
        spell and instantly summon up a pet to help them out. The truth is this will<br>
        only slow you down until at you're at least three. You could in fact easily<br>
        get away with not buying this spell at all. But I did find it useful when it<br>
        was appropriate. Be sure to start collecting bone chips now, you'll need<br>
        them all your life. Something to note about gnomes is the decaying gnome<br>
        skeletons in the Basement and in the Steamfont are your friends. If you kill<br>
        them the Dark Reflection won't be happy. So when it's bone chip harvesting<br>
        time, you'll have to head for Greater Faydark until you're old enough to<br>
        take out the older skeletons."<br>
        "Keep this up till four. Be sure to train once in meditate. The spells you<br>
        get at this level will introduce you to a very useful strategy you'll use<br>
        for quite some time: Reverse Kiting. (The name comes from the hunting method<br>
        druids and shamans call a strategy: Kiting.) The spells involved are<br>
        Clinging Darkness, Poison Bolt, Fear, and Life Spike. You simply pull the<br>
        monster with Clinging Darkness, sic your pet on it, fear it, and start<br>
        Poison Bolt. Life Spike as needed. With this wonderful tactic, you can take<br>
        out creatures far stronger than you (OOC: yellows, even low reds). Of course<br>
        this only works in a large open area, but early on that's all you'll be<br>
        fighting in. Something to note is the fact that the entire line of darkness<br>
        spells is highly resistible. So many times it won't stick on the first cast.<br>
        Just back up as your pet tanks and recast. Hopefully it'll stick after a<br>
        couple casts."<br>
        A large pile of bones in the corner suddenly rises and forms Zinbik's pet.<br>
        It stumbles out of the room and runs down the hallway. Zinbik smiles and<br>
        waits as he smoothes out his robes. In a few minutes the pet returns with a<br>
        small tray. After setting the tray on the table it returns to the same<br>
        corner and collapses once more. "Drink?" Zinbik asks as he pours some<br>
        Gnomish Spirits from the tray into his stein. He then offers the bottle to<br>
        you along with a small glass. You politely accept and fill the glass. After<br>
        a few sips, Zinbik strokes his beard in thought before continuing.<br>
        "Pets are wonderful things. For two bone chips you get an instant tank to<br>
        serve your every need. In the midst of battle though, its death can easily<br>
        mean your death. So learning to keep it alive is quite important. In the<br>
        very beginning you always melee along side it, taking most of the blows. A<br>
        little later on, learn to take a few hits, back off to leach it, then go<br>
        back into melee. When you get Mend Bones things get a little easier. You can<br>
        stay out of melee entirely and keep your pet healed. (Remember, these<br>
        strategies and tips still apply as you get older and get spell updates.) By<br>
        about 20 or so, you shouldn't be going into melee at all. The damage you do<br>
        won't be enough to risk getting hit. And the spells you'll be casting will<br>
        make the monster angry enough that you should be working to keep your<br>
        distance anyway.<br>
        "Technically you don't even have to use bone chips if there's some undead<br>
        already in the area. We get two undead charm spells in our spell<br>
        progression. You won't use these often at all though. For one, necromancers<br>
        are not known for their charisma (which is fairly important for these<br>
        spells). Second, charms usually don't last long, especially because of our<br>
        low charisma. This means at any moment it'll break the charm and attack you<br>
        (in a solo situation this is NOT good). This brings us to the biggest and<br>
        last problem: you can't charm with a pet. This means if you want to charm<br>
        something you won't have the advantage of a pet when it breaks charm. And<br>
        charm is also easily resistible, instantly aggroing the creature on you<br>
        without a pet. The only times this is useful are A.) You have to get in the<br>
        area invisibly and there isn't a safe place to summon a pet inside. B.)<br>
        You're trying to separate a spawn so you charm one of the creatures and keep<br>
        it alive for a bit. Both of those require a group to back you up of course.<br>
        The only time to use it in a solo situation is C.) There's only two<br>
        creatures and you plan on feigning the moment the non-charmed one is dead<br>
        (this is quite dangerous in any case).<br>
        "This brings me to what I believe to be the best spell you'll ever get:<br>
        Feign Death. This spell will save your life NUMEROUS times! As soon as you<br>
        reach 16, buy this, memorize it, and never forget it. At the first sign of<br>
        fatal danger, cast this immediately. As an experienced necromancer you'll<br>
        know so much about death you can easily fake it. As far as anyone else is<br>
        concerned you're dead. A very useful thing about this is you might have<br>
        noticed you can cast on someone even when they're dead. The same applies to<br>
        you when you're faking it. This is great when you feign in a dungeon and<br>
        have 5 creatures standing on top of you. If someone can get near enough to<br>
        cast on you without aggroing the creatures they can cast invisibility on you<br>
        so you can get up and escape. Or if you're low on health and are forced to<br>
        feign to get away from an angry monster, the healer in your group can take<br>
        the opportunity to restore your health.<br>
        "Something to note is that due to some crazy change in the way world works<br>
        (OOC: Nerfing), after playing dead for two minutes your pet now comes to<br>
        believe that you've abandoned him and he can go back to being dead. So if<br>
        you feign in the middle of a battle, be sure to get up in that time limit or<br>
        you'll be in some trouble.<br>
        OOC: I don't know who the heck was able to let their pet hunt for them for<br>
        an entire night's sleep while they stayed feigned on the ground but this is<br>
        hardly a viable hunting method. Contrary to popular Verant belief, when you<br>
        feign, your pet will not last long on it's own even against blue creatures.<br>
        The only way you could possibly do this is if you set your pet up at some<br>
        place where a very low blue spawned slowly enough for your pet to recover<br>
        it's health in between fights. This is ridiculous, it'd take days to get a<br>
        whole bar of experience. And in that time someone who IS awake would surely<br>
        come along and take your camp. This is the kind of problem you worry about<br>
        when all major problems are already solved, which was not the case here. End<br>
        Rant.<br>
        &quot;Harmshield is another lifesaver. This one is also permanently memorized. It<br>
        makes you completely invulnerable to magic and melee (including healing<br>
        magic) for approximately 10 seconds. It only recovers every 7 minutes though<br>
        (OOC: or when you zone) so you can't just be indefinitely invulnerable<br>
        forever. The only problem whatsoever is that you can still be stunned. But<br>
        this is great if you run into something like a Hill Giant or Griffin (before<br>
        you're old enough to take them on) and you're somewhere near the zone. Just<br>
        cast and run.<br>
        "Now most of you're life combat will consist of your pet tanking and you<br>
        DOTing. But there are a couple exceptions to this rule. At level 24, your<br>
        DOTs will be quite outdated, but you will get Shock of Poison, your first<br>
        direct damage spell. At this point you start fighting like a mage. Just hold<br>
        out on the nuking until your pet's had some time to taunt and damage the<br>
        creature. This way they won't instantly aggro on you the moment you cast.&nbsp;<br>
        "Let me take this opportunity to make a note about the life tap line of<br>
        spells (which I generally referred to as leaches until someone actually<br>
        invented the spell: Leach). This is one of the lines of spells which gives<br>
        us the ability to be a very solitary class. We get to hurt an enemy while<br>
        healing ourselves at the same time. But many young necromancers make the<br>
        mistake of treating this line like normal DD spells. This is very<br>
        inefficient. Always give yourself an excuse before using these. At the early<br>
        levels just melee some so you can take some hits (and let your pet avoid<br>
        some) then back off and cast.<br>
        "By level eight though, you'll get a much better excuse though: Dark Pact<br>
        (and the rest of this line of spells). This is a wonderful series of spells<br>
        which trades health for mana. This will allow you to recover your mana a lot<br>
        faster as well as taking some health away, giving you a reason to life tap.<br>
        And they only cost 5 mana to activate, so you've got nothing to lose. Just<br>
        make sure you keep track of your health (you'll feel really stupid if you<br>
        manage to kill yourself this way). Of course when you get to level 34 this<br>
        gets even better. This is when you get my favorite spell: Call of Bones.<br>
        This has the same effect as the previous spells in this series but also</font><br>
        tur<font face="Arial" size="2">ns you into a skeleton. Just be especially careful since most guards that<br>
        usually let you pass will suddenly hate you. Though surprisingly, some<br>
        people like you MORE as a skeleton (like the Dark Bargainers). What really<br>
        gets me though, is the fact that most undead still hate you as much as they<br>
        always did with this spell on.<br>
        "Of course, with the same powers we use to transfer health from our enemies<br>
        to ourselves, we can transfer health from ourselves to our friends. The Dark<br>
        Empathy/Shadow Compact line is quite useful in emergency group situations.<br>
        We can't heal nearly as well as one of the healing classes would, but if<br>
        they're out of mana, or totally absent, we can fill the role. Just be sure<br>
        to not to over-heal and keep life tapping to make up for the health you're<br>
        giving away. "Another interesting line of spells is the Scent line. These<br>
        spells lower a monster's fire, poison, and disease resistances. It's also a<br>
        poison-based spell. It sounds quite useful until you find out how resistable<br>
        it is. It pretty much requires you to have an enchanter there to Tashan or<br>
        it won't work. But if you're expecting a long arduous battle you should<br>
        probably consider it.<br>
        "Something you might wonder about when you get to 20, is what to specialize<br>
        in. Well, there's only two choices you should really consider: Alteration<br>
        and Conjuration. Alteration is the choice for most necromancers (like<br>
        myself). This covers most of our important damage spells as well as our<br>
        healing spells (enemy to self and self to friend). The other choice,<br>
        Conjuration, covers the pet spells, the darkness line, and the two DDs we<br>
        get. Though we might use divination plenty (for invisibility), there's no<br>
        reason to specialize in it since you don't have to worry about it in the<br>
        heat of battle. Evocation only covers our undead DDs which just aren't used<br>
        as often as alteration spells. The only thing you might worry about with<br>
        Abjuration is Feign Death (I still don't understand why this uses<br>
        Abjuration) since it's important for this not to be interrupted as well as<br>
        to have the mana you need to cast it. But it's just not worth it."<br>
        OOC: Be aware that as soon as you get to 20, spend all five points in<br>
        specialization. Put one point in each specialization skill. For some reason<br>
        if you only put a point in Specialize: Alteration, it won't advance<br>
        properly. Besides, it makes spells cost cheaper sometimes if you use the<br>
        specialize skill for each skill. Specialization won't kick in as much for<br>
        them, but it will sometimes.<br>
        You hear a snap from across the room. Zinbik reflexively grabs his harvester<br>
        (making one of his eyes turn grey and go slack) and scans the room.<br>
        Relaxing, he sets it back down and pauses, "The good people of the Temple of<br>
        Solusek Ro are very generous. In exchange for the items they'd need to make<br>
        another pair, they'll give you the boots off their feet! I guess now's a<br>
        good a time as any to give you my advice on how to deal with their little<br>
        quests.<br>
        "The biggest problem with each one is the shadowed item you'll need. Each<br>
        quest requires you to get something off those blasted Shadowed Men. Luckily,<br>
        Vurgo's quests (the Harvester and the Words of Darkness) allow you to turn<br>
        in the shadowed item alone for a note (reminding Vurgo of the fact that you<br>
        already turned it in). One way to solve a few problems at once though is to<br>
        head to Nektulos. The Shadowed Man hangout here is generally surrounded by a<br>
        bunch of large spiders and shadow wolves. This way you can take care of all<br>
        the shadowed man items and the shadow silk at the same time. It's also close<br>
        to the Temple of Solusek Ro so you can turn the stuff in as soon as you get<br>
        it.<br>
        "The easiest quest is the Shadowbound Boots. I did this at level 20. You<br>
        need Shadow Silk, a Scepter of Sorrow, an Eye of Shadow, and a Skeletal Toe.<br>
        I'm not master tailor, but I've kept my mother's trade alive. It doesn't<br>
        take that much skill to make the Shadow Silk, but it might help to find<br>
        someone who has a little skill with a sewing kit. For the Scepter of Sorrow,<br>
        just head to Mistmoore and go to the crypt. Pick up the flower off the<br>
        coffin, go behind the building and give it to the former shadowed man there<br>
        for the scepter. The Eye of Shadow has to be gotten from an actual Shadowed<br>
        Man. The Skeletal Toe is found on Giant Skeletons in the Rathe Mountains.<br>
        You don't even have to kill one though since most people will leave these on<br>
        their corpses. Just take all these back to the Temple and you've got some<br>
        black boots.<br>
        "The Shadowbound Gloves are almost as easy to get. They require Inky Shadow<br>
        Silk (just a little harder to make than the regular kind), a Scepter of<br>
        Tears, a Hand of Shadow, and a Skeletal Finger. For the Scepter of Tears<br>
        just get a map and head to Lower Guk; it'll be lying on the floor so just<br>
        pick it up and go. The Hand of Shadow is off Shadowed Men. The Skeletal<br>
        Finger is also on Giant Skeletons in the Rathe Mountains. Take them all back<br>
        to the Temple for some nice black gloves.<br>
        "The Harvester is a little harder to get. You need a Shadowed Scythe, a<br>
        Fungus Eye, a Shadowed Knife, and a Fire Opal. The Shadowed Scythe is off of<br>
        Shadowed Men. The Fungus Eye is off the Mortuary Fungus in Unrest, people<br>
        often leave the eye on these as well since it's no drop and you can't sell<br>
        it. The Shadowed Knife is found on the Goblin Headmaster on Oracle Island in<br>
        the Ocean of Tears. You might have to kill him a couple times since<br>
        sometimes he carries the mask mages need for one of their quests. You CAN<br>
        find Fire Opals on Seafury Cyclopses, but it's a lot easier to find Genni in<br>
        the Temple. She charges 55pp for them.<br>
        "The Words of Darkness definitely requires some friends. You need a Shadowed<br>
        Book, a Book of Darkness, and a Book of Frost. The Book of Shadow is off of<br>
        Shadowed Men, but it seems litteracy isn't rampant among them since they're<br>
        rarely dropped. The Book of Darkness is in Lake Rathe. When you come to the<br>
        lake from the Karanas, just head to the the island with the tall building.<br>
        Inside you'll find two Erudites: a female mage and a male wizard, you want<br>
        the mage. Two or three people in their 20s should be able to handle them<br>
        both. The Book of Frost is found on the Icy Goblin in the jail in<br>
        Permafrost. He's got lots of friends with him though so I'd suggest a very<br>
        large or high-leveled group. Turn all these in along with 300gp for your<br>
        very own cool-looking open book.<br>
        Zinbik runs his hand over his robe and frowns, "The Robe of Enshroudment is<br>
        by far the most annoying quest. You need Large Shadow Silk (the hardest<br>
        Shadow Silk to make), a Globe of Shadow, a Mask of Shadow, and a Werebat<br>
        Wing. The Mask of Shadow is off of Shadowed Men. The Werebat Wing is pulled<br>
        off a Werebat in Unrest. The Globe of Shadow is the most annoying part. It's<br>
        found on the Nokta Shaman in Upper Guk. He's not that hard, but he's got<br>
        quite a bit of friends nearby. This isn't the half of it though. Most of the<br>
        time he's got a double (OOC: Placeholder) in his stead. Even when he does<br>
        show his ugly face though, he rarely drops the Globe. I'm convinced that<br>
        when he's about to die he breaks it just so no one else can have it. But<br>
        after hours of killing Frogluks you might just get it. Just expect a long<br>
        wait."<br>
        Zinbik stretches, shifting in his seat. He continues, "Groups are something<br>
        you'll learn about much later than most. It's just so much easier and more<br>
        effective for you to solo at the early levels. But eventually you'll have to<br>
        join a group and you're going to need to know what role you're to fill.<br>
        First let's look at partnerships. This is the simplest group, but still<br>
        quite effective. Since the number of people in the group is proportional to<br>
        the ease you can take things on, you can be doubly effective with a single<br>
        partner. But with only one other person grouped with you, just act the same<br>
        way you would if you were soloing. Deviations depend on who you're hunting<br>
        with. I hunt a lot with a mage friend of mine. This covers a lot of ground.<br>
        We've got the most powerful DOTs, the second best DDs, minor healing power,<br>
        unlimited food and water, two tanks, unlimited weapons for our pets, and<br>
        limitless possibilities for strategies. We do just fine in dungeons or<br>
        outdoors. Another good partner if you're outside is the rogue. They can<br>
        backstab away while you keep the monster feared allowing major damage<br>
        possibility.<br>
        "Another possibility for a partner not to overlook is another necromancer.<br>
        With proper coordination you can divide up the DOTs (they don't stack with<br>
        themselves) so you each use only half the mana. Also, you can take on<br>
        something as much as five levels above each of you by attacking with your<br>
        pets and life tapping. Don't waste mana on anything else since they'll only<br>
        be resisted. But the life tap line is only resisted by extremely magic<br>
        resistant creatures. You'll use up a lot of mana and you might be forced to<br>
        feign if things get ugly, but you can do quite well like this.<br>
        "At the later levels though, partnerships just won't be enough if you want<br>
        to take on the big boys. So you've got to learn how to act in a dungeon, in<br>
        a full group. Many classes have specific, defining role in a group. There's<br>
        tanks, healers, nukers, crowd controllers, group buffers, death speeders,<br>
        and travel agents. Necromancers fulfill every one of these roles in at least<br>
        a minor way. But be sure you understand what's going on around you so you<br>
        can fulfill your own role properly.<br>
        "First there's tanks. A tank's job is to keep the enemy on themselves and to<br>
        stay alive. There's plenty of classes who can fill this role: warriors,<br>
        monks, rogues, paladins, shadow knights, and rangers are the usuals. Bards,<br>
        druids, clerics, shamans, and pets can fill this role as well. They keep the<br>
        monsters busy while you cast. Your pet is what helps you fill this role.<br>
        Just keep your pet healed and on the right monster and you'll be doing your<br>
        job in this role.<br>
        "Next there's healers. A healer's job is to keep everyone alive and well.<br>
        The best classes to fill this role are the mystics: clerics, druids, and<br>
        shamans. Others can fill this role in a minor way too: bards, paladins,<br>
        rangers, and you. Of course any class can train in bind wounds to heal up to<br>
        half health. Your most common fulfillment of this role is to heal yourself<br>
        with the life tap line. But when the need is there you can heal others too.<br>
        You should usually reserve this role for between fights. You can bring a<br>
        warrior back to full health, but it takes time. So your best chance is to<br>
        concentrate on killing the enemy before you bother healing the group. Also,<br>
        before it comes time for battle make sure the group healer (assuming you<br>
        aren't trying to do this) knows not to heal you (since you have the life tap<br>
        line) unless you're getting low on health and are under attack or if you're<br>
        out of mana.<br>
        "Next are the nukers. A nuker's job is to finish a monster off quickly. Some<br>
        classes are better at this than others: Wizards and mages are exceptional.<br>
        Druids, enchanters, clerics, shamans, even you can nuke at times.<br>
        Technically rangers can nuke when needed as well. The only DDs you ever get<br>
        are Shock of Poison at 24 and Ignite Bones at 44. So you can't always fill<br>
        this role very well at all. But when you do, just be careful about it. Wait<br>
        till the tanks have done more damage than you can do before you nuke or<br>
        you'll get yourself in some trouble.<br>
        "Next are the crowd controllers. This includes a few classes: enchanters<br>
        (the masters), wizards, clerics, bards, and necromancers. You fulfill this<br>
        role in three ways: fearing, mezzing, and undead charming. You're no<br>
        enchanter, your use in this role is limited. Fearing is only useful outdoors<br>
        (unless you have a death wish), but it can be quite useful to reduce the<br>
        number of enemies on you (it gives you the time it takes for the creature to<br>
        run, then run back). You get Screaming Terror at 24 though, which mesmerizes<br>
        a creature for about 30 seconds. Of course this is effected by charisma,<br>
        which you probably won't have much of. I've already told you about charming.<br>
        "Then there's group buffers. Some classes are pretty darn good at this:<br>
        shamans (the masters), clerics, enchanters, and druids fill this role well.<br>
        Wizards, mages, and you can also fill this role at times. (Bards fit this<br>
        role during battle itself.) You don't have many targetable buffs, but you do<br>
        get some. Just make sure they're up before it comes time for battle.<br>
        "Next are death speeders. These classes are enchanters, bards, mages,<br>
        shamans, druids, and you. This is where necromancers really shine. With the<br>
        best DOTs in all of Norrath, the scent line (to help the other casters), the<br>
        Heart Flutter line, and a pet (a physical DOT) we make death come quick. The<br>
        key in a group though is to cast the fastest DOTs you have (poisons are the<br>
        best). Only when you don't have many people in the group or it's an<br>
        especially rare and powerful monster should you pull out your slow acting<br>
        DOTs.<br>
        "Finally there're the travel agents. These classes really shine in a long<br>
        term group. But these classes also help escape a bad situation. There are<br>
        some who are definitely better than others at this: druids and wizards are<br>
        the best; whisking you miles away from danger at the cast of a spell. Others<br>
        can help too: bards, shamans, rangers, monks, shadow knights, and you.<br>
        (Clerics, with ressurections, could be considered to fit this category as<br>
        well.) The way you (as well as monks and shadow knights) help is simple:<br>
        Feign Death. This is a major role you help with when things go bad.&nbsp;<br>
        "Say your group is highly engaged in an epic battle with many enemies.<br>
        Everyone's fully occupied, you know you're barely going to make it. Suddenly<br>
        a pair roaming monsters come along and decide to join in. You're the only<br>
        one who seems to notice, so you're the one who yells for everyone to run.<br>
        You've been working hard up till now to keep the monsters from all ganging<br>
        up and beating the crap out of you. But now you want to use their anger to<br>
        your advantage. As everyone else gates, evacuates, and high tails it out of<br>
        there, you cast Harmshield and jump into the fray. All the monsters jump<br>
        onto you, frantically trying to hurt you despite your invulnerability. In a<br>
        matter of seconds it drops. You madly cast and miraculously aren't<br>
        interrupted in trying to feign death. As you drop to the ground they all run<br>
        after the rest of the group who's already almost gone. You've saved the day!<br>
        "Also, always pay attention to who you group with. Followers of the Prime<br>
        Healer may normally seek to heal and protect. Some of them might include you<br>
        in that. Others might feel letting you die heals a great stain on Norrath.<br>
        Tribunal followers might leave you for dead since you didn't pay your taxes.<br>
        Erollisi followers might decide you don't love your pet enough. Don't always<br>
        assume good guys will seek your death, but be careful all the same."<br>
        Zinbik yawns as you do the same. He continues though, "One thing more.<br>
        Whenever you're practicing in the field, always remember you represent<br>
        something larger than yourself when you practice necromancy. Always act with<br>
        honor, style, and dignity. Just because Innoruuk tells you to hate thy<br>
        neighbor doesn't mean you act like a common thief. And be consistent. If you<br>
        refuse to group with high elves, don't group with high elves. Don't let the<br>
        Tunarian cleric into your group simply because you're desperate for a<br>
        healer. If you wanted to be a rogue, be a rogue (not to say all rogues are<br>
        untrustable, common thieves). By acting like a jerk, you might be ruining<br>
        the chances for a nicer necromancer to get into an important group."<br>
        OOC: Some people seem to get the idea that role playing an evil character<br>
        requires you to be a jerk in general. This simply isn't true, just as it is<br>
        that not all good characters are pillars of honor and compassion. It simply<br>
        entails a different belief system. It certainly doesn't mean doing whatever<br>
        you can to make everyone's life miserable. This doesn't mean you have to<br>
        role play a weak fool who can't stand up for himself in the name of his dark<br>
        beliefs, but don't use this as an excuse to be a mean-spirited a**hole. Some<br>
        people really give others a bad reputation out of a sick, stupid, ignorant<br>
        view of role playing. And remember, this IS a game. The whole point of it is<br>
        to have fun. Of course if your opinion of fun is making others miserable, go<br>
        play a nice single-player game. Until we consider a computer character<br>
        sentient, this shouldn't have any negative moral implications.<br>
        Zinbik rises from his chair and shakes your hand as he says, "Well, I can't<br>
        think of anything more to say. I bid you safe journeys and a good career in<br>
        necromancy. If you ever have any more questions, just ask."<br>
        When you start to get up you stumble; you're left foot is asleep. You shake<br>
        it and massage it until you finally regain feeling. When you look up, Zinbik<br>
        is gone. You head down the hallway you came from until you see a cryptic<br>
        message appear in front of you: LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.<br>
