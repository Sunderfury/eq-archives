        </strong></em></font><font color="#804000" size="2"><em><strong>Hello
        All, <br>
        We apologize for the problems some of you have
        experienced getting into EverQuest after the <br>
        launch of Luclin. As of just a bit ago, we patched a new
        graphics DLL that fixes the problems <br>
        some of our users (AMD users in particular) were
        experincing crashing to desktop. This does not <br>
        mean that all crashes to desktop have been fixed, but
        this code had the potential for a lot of side <br>
        effects, and fixing it is a big step forward. <br>
        In the coming week you will see us concentrating on
        fixing many of the problems that remain. We<br>
        are also hard at work on optimizations for both framerate
        and loading time. Load time is a particularly <br>
        big target for us to work on, and we have some promising
        results in development. Our goal is to have <br>
        that code out to you as soon as possible, but it needs to
        really be tested properly before we will feel <br>
        comfortable doing that. <br>
        In addition, we're also working on server side stability
        in a few zones, most notably Hollowshade Moor. <br>
        These should be taken care of very rapidly as well. <br>
        Thanks very much for your patience. <br>
        The EverQuest Team </strong></em></font></p>
