<i>One Sponsor:</i></font><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;
We are invite only.&nbsp; A member of MoC (not in a trial period) has to
sponsor you to the Officers of MoC.&nbsp; Do not post or seek sponsors prior 
to getting approval from the officers.&nbsp; The Applicant should be level 45 
or higher to be considered for membership.&nbsp; Some exceptions may be made.
</font>
</P>

<p>
<font color="#B0C4DE">
<I>Officer Approval:</font></i><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; 
The MoC sponsor will propose the applicant to the guild officers 
(via posting on the MoC message board in the "New Recruits" message 
area).&nbsp; The officers will decide if we need that particular 
person, class, level at the moment. It will be a simple yes/no within 
a few days time.&nbsp; The officers will discuss the application.</font>
</P>

<p>
<font color="#B0C4DE">
<I>Five Sponsors:</font></i><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;
Upon officer agreement, an officer will post a call for sponsors in 
our "New Recruits" message area.&nbsp; Here MoC members can read
about the person, hear the recommendation from the original sponsor and
choose to sponsor the applicant or not.&nbsp; The applicant will need 5 
MoC sponsors (who are not in a trial period), and not have any outstanding 
"no" votes.&nbsp; If there are "no" votes, then the officers and guild will
talk about it.&nbsp; If the issues cannot be resolved, the application
is terminated.</font>
</P>

<P>
<font color="#B0C4DE">
<I>Trial Membership:</font></i><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;
Once the applicant gets 5 sponsors, they are invited into the guild for 
a trial month.&nbsp; During the trial month they should go above and beyond 
and show us why we need them.&nbsp; They will participate in guild raids/events,
read/post to the guild message boards and be a very active member.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="#B0C4DE"><i>Final Voting:</font></i><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; 
Once the trial month is up, the applicant's full membership will be voted on 
by guild officers.&nbsp; If the applicant receives a "no" vote, the issues will 
be discussed among the guild officers.&nbsp; If the issues cannot be resolved, 
the applicant is removed from the guild.</font>
</P>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>&nbsp;<i>Removal from the guild</font></i>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;Sad as it is, sometimes people simply cannot
get along and personalities clash, or people act in ways that are unacceptable
to guild guidelines. We don't want any boat rockers, greedy people, wingnuts, 
or people that don't put in 110% effort. Guild officers will decide on who 
will be removed from the guild.</font>
