<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Well, at 35 I heard that chasing Gnome gaurds is pretty good. At lvl 34 with 146 wizdome I tried to solo a guard but I never had the mana in the end to do that blast and I ran into problems (good thing for that esnare).
But now at 35 I have 155 wiz and I think it will be easier to solo Gnomish guards and other guards easier since you can med without the book if you run out of mana in the end.

Also SK at 35 should be pretty good hunting avocets or camping that Bard. But it gets boring eventually.

Your best bet would be to group at LGuk. If you get a group at BR or The SR you will gain very good xp, it just needs to be a group that know what it's doing and no deaths.

Also in Unrest, is a good way to get xp, The Ghost room is more than good for a lvl 35 up to 37 (me thinks). Also you get good loot such as FS stuff and words or pages for your researching needs (if you are not a druid-or for a friend). Also you have a good chance to get the Dwarven Work Boots, for your self or for trade. THey are +3str +5dex and 8 ac. So you see it is benificial to many classes as for a Druid. Also the common drop the Jagged Band, which is a 5ac and 3str ring is also a good way to make money by selling it since you can get lots of them in a day of camping there. Also Unrest is an open dungeon that will allow you to use all of your spells.

So as you see at lvl 35 there are quite some choices you can select. And if you are a druid that hates grouping, then it's best to learn how to.

I don't really remember were I went at lvl 14. I think Unrest is a good place to fight at, since u get SOW and all, but it's kinda hard. A good thing is to group with a necro or a mage, since they have good pets, or even a tank, and just let the tank get the damage and you heal and DS.

Also I heard that at 14, lavastorm is a good place fight because of the elementals. And since a druid at 14 gets levitate and a DD against Summoned stuff such elementals, it's a good place to fight.

Well I hope I have been usefull</TEXTAREA>
