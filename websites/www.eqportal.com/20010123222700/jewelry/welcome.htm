<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000"><strong>Welcome to the Tal Kor Jewelry Academy!</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The art of jewelcraft is an expensive, often frustrating, but
interesting hobby. While not terribly profitable (and not at all profitable at lower
levels), it is still a fascinating trade to pursue and will allow you to make items that
are either not readily available from merchants or that are sold by merchants for
phenomenal amounts of money. The Academy's purpose is to guide you as you develop your
skills.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Within these walls you will find information on jewelry components,
gem/metal combinations, and anything else pertaining to jewelcraft. You will also find
the approximate cost of jewelry components. Please note that these prices are <strong>approximate</strong>
and will most assuredly vary depending on your charisma and location.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">All prices are based on merchants from the various cities.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I've added some of the missing jewelry
        pictures and some attributes. Thanks to all who sent me the
        information!! I'm still missing pictures and attributes for jacinth jewelry, so if anyone has this information, please email me! :-)
        I've also added a new section in <a href="jewelry_by_type.html" target="_self">Jewelry
        by Type</a> to provide a quick list of engagement and wedding rings and
        a <a href="The_Art_of_Jewelcraft.htm" target="_self">trivial chart</a>.
        Finally, after months of requests, I've added a section for <a href="price_list.htm" target="_self">jewelry
        pricing</a>. We'll see how this goes. It may or may not become a permanent
        section.</font></td>
