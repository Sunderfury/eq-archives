        Practice
        each one of your combat skills starting at level 1.&nbsp; Start with
        Piercing (So that it will be maxed for Backstabbing), then move to
        Slashing, then to Blunt.&nbsp; The latter may fall behind a bit at
        times, don't worry, just keep them as high as possible.&nbsp; Consider
        fighting creatures that you have to take extra swings at to kill, maybe
        even kill some greens if you really need to catch up.<br>

        These go up fairly easily with use, so when you see the button pop up,
        stop, press them both, then keep going.&nbsp; You won't regret it in the
        long run.</font></font></td>

        most efficient way of &quot;earning&quot; money.&nbsp; It's going to be
        very important for you to increase the skill as fast as possible.&nbsp;
        Here are a couple of tips for doing just that.</font><br>

        </font><font color="#CC0000"> You don't have to
        fight or be ready to fight your victim.&nbsp; I made several&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gold at level 7 by stealing off Smugglers that other
        people were fighting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :^)</font><font color="#FF0000"> <br>
        </font><font color="#0000FF">2)</font><font color="#FF0000"> </font><font color="#CC0000"> Pick Pocket
        while you're fighting.&nbsp; You should have a hot key set to PP.&nbsp; Start you fight off with a PP then when it pops
        back up turn off attack,&nbsp; tap then PP, then turn attack back on.&nbsp; Doing
        this I could normally get 6&nbsp;PP's off one blue MOB.&nbsp;</font><br>
        <font color="#996633">
        Using these methods I was able to move from level 4 to level 40 PP in
        just under two hours!!&nbsp; And make descent money for a level 7
        character.</font></font></td>

      <td width="469" height="185" valign="top"><font color="#996633" size="3">Dealing with MOBs and PC's that
        have damage shields can be VERY dangerous for a rogue, considering the
        number of attacks per round we get.&nbsp; Luckily, there is a way to
        prevent this sure death.&nbsp; Collect some pumice stones, you can get
        them from herb merchants, and keep them in a bag at all times.&nbsp;
        When you come up against said enemy target them, then click one of the
        pumice stones and it will dispell one of their buffs.&nbsp; Use at least
        4 when fighting a Druid, Shaman, or Cleric, and you will be reasonably
        sure of not only dispelling the accursed damage shield, but also their
        buffs that give them such an edge.&nbsp; These things are INVALUABLE in
        PvP.&nbsp; There are rumors of multi-charge pumice stones, but still
        under research for me.</font></td>
