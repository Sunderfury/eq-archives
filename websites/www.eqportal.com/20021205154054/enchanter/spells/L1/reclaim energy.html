    <td width="608" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">Early on this spell actually recovers less then or the
    same energy as it takes to cast and seems to have no appearant value.&nbsp; It doesn't
    reclaim casting components, only mana.&nbsp; It is not until later that its true value
    becomes appearant.<p>First reason:&nbsp; The pets we summon have some variance in
    level.&nbsp; There are times you may wish to summon pets until you get the strongest
    available pet (you can determine its relative strength with /consider).&nbsp; Casting
    invisibility or zoning will effectively remove your pet, but one is wasteful or mana the
    other is wasteful of time.&nbsp; Reclaim energy is quicker than either and will save on
    mana in the long run.</p>
    <p>Second reason:&nbsp; Given that our pets are not true pets and can not be commanded,
    they may occasionaly proceed to attack something that attacks you, despite the fact you
    may not want to kill what's attacking you.&nbsp; Case in point: gnomes are allowed in
    Neriak to begin with.&nbsp; Orcs do not like gnomes and will attack them on sight. &nbsp;
    Orcs on Faydwer are aligned with the Indigo Brotherhood (warrior guild and guards of
    Neriak).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, killing enough orcs will preclude a gnome's ability to safely
    walk the streets and forests around Neriak.&nbsp; While its a simple matter to <a
    href="../L2/mesmerize.html" target="_self">mesmerize</a> the orc and keep it from killing
    you, once your pet is defending you, you will be unable to call it off and prevent it from
    hitting the orc and removing the spell.&nbsp; As a result, without quick intervention,
    either the orc will win out and kill you in the end, or the orc will die and you will take
    a faction hit against the Indigo Brotherhood.&nbsp; To resolve this you need a quick way
    to destroy your pet before you can effectively <a href="../L2/mesmerize.html"
    target="_self">mesmerize</a> the orc and go on your merry way without altering your
    faction standing in Neriak.&nbsp; If you successfully manage to use this method to escape
    faction hits, I would advise zoning as soon as possible as well.&nbsp; As soon as someone
    or something else decides to kill the mob you've fooled, it still remembers that you
    participated and you will still receive faction adjustments.&nbsp; Zoning is the only way
    to avoid this.</td>
