</FONT><HR>A long essay I'm revising to send to verant <BR>by Calenth <BR>                                                                            posted 5/20/99 9:19:14 PM <P><BR>Here's an old rant (originally aimed at kastur, heh) that i'm revising to outline what I see as problems and what I<BR>see as solutions re <IMG SRC="http://www.refplace.com/forum/ubb/redface.gif">ur class. Give me some feedback before I send it off, if you would. Thanks.<P>****************<P>Regardless of our ability to do damage by extremely indirect means, our lack of a generalized ability to<BR>efficiently and reliably effect combat presents a severe problem and danger to the class at all levels of play. <BR>The more efficient and reliable damage sources are denied us, to a greater extent than any other class. It has<BR>been established that our direct damage and DoT spells are the weakest overall of the casting classes. GZ has<BR>confirmed that and stated it as intentional. We're not supposed to have melee, we're an int based caster, not a<BR>wis. I'll move on.<P>There are essentially two effective ways in which an enchanter may attempt to alter combat directly: the first<BR>being by the mesmerize/stun assortment of spells, the recently nerfed Whirl being (at one time) the most famous<BR>of these; the other is by use of debuff spells of various types. Primarily, these are ineffective due to the<BR>all-too-often mentioned resist rate problems. The most generalized problems with these are caused by the<BR>broken random number generator; while a resist rate of 5% or 10% or 15% is fine for a tashaned mob, getting<BR>those five out of a hundred resists all one after the other is not. Furthermore, casting that initial tashan is not<BR>always practical or even possible; you can’t tashan before a lull, you can’t tashan three things all running<BR>towards you at once, you can’t tashan an enemy wizard and hope to get a second spell off before you’ve been<BR>reduced to your last bubble of health. There are more specific problems with individual spells also; whirl has<BR>been reduced to simply unacceptable levels of effectiveness, for example, and the high-level debuffs are<BR>actually less effective than comparable first and second circle spells (at least against NPCs) due to the rising<BR>discrepancy at high levels between NPC and PC statistics. <P><BR>There are numerous ways, however, by which an enchanter can affect combat indirectly . .via the animations,<BR>charmed pets, or buffs on other party members. Because these abilities are inefficient and unreliable, the<BR>enchanter is unfortunately one of the weakest and slowest-leveling classes in the game. [Note: this is not<BR>necessarily a bad thing. This is a game, not a race. But it is a fact, regardless.] <P>1. Animations. These are great, for what they are. At low levels especially, they are a wonderful addition to the<BR>class; the ability to strike magically at 8th is the reason every enchanter I know did wisps between 8 and 12.<BR>However: you couldn't pick a worse class to give uncommandable pets. As enchanters rise in levels, they<BR>require more and more intelligence of play and overall use of tactics; and the eternal chance of a runaway,<BR>uncontrollable, Surprise-pulling pet (especially in dungeons) is simply too dangerous to allow for the pet's<BR>regular use. (This is aside from the fact of the pet's low general hp's -- our assorted stun spells render this only a<BR>minor problem. [NOTE: this last sentence was written before the recent Whirl changes. It is a MAJOR problem<BR>now.) While the pets are great in their way, they are simply unreliable; and that causes far too many problems. <P>2. Charm. "When an enchanter wants a pet, he charms one." This is a true statement. I use currently use charm<BR>to the almost complete exclusion of the animations. I love the spell, for what it is; but what it is is not reliable. It<BR>may be resisted all too easily; it may break at any given moment. It has a nasty tendency to get both the<BR>once-charmed mob and whatever it attacked simultaneously melleeing the now hapless (get out that color flux<BR>and run, boy!) enchanter. Whatever a given players stats or level, (200 chr level 50 or 75 chr level 12) charm is a<BR>wonderful and immensely powerful spell . .but it is unreliable. <P>3. The buffing spells; the quickness line especially seems mentioned here. Again, in their way, these are<BR>wonderful spells. We are not the game's best buffers by any means; but we do have a few very useful spells,<BR>and the quickness line (especially when cast on monks) can bring about a marvelous increase in the party's<BR>overall strength and ability to deal damage. However, they are just as unreliable (and In many ways even more<BR>so) than the above two methods. Buffs on animations or charmed subjects are unreliable for the reasons the<BR>pets themselves are unreliable: so I'll dispense with what should be an obvious argument. People may argue<BR>that buffs on party members circumvent the problems above; in a way, they do, but they bring more problems of<BR>their own. The primary problem of course is that party members tend to be fairly unreliable, if not moreso than a<BR>charmed pet. One can at least be certain that a charmed pet will follow commands as long as the spell lasts. All<BR>to frequently, a reliance on others (albiet buffed others) results in failure of the given endeavor. I'm sure we've all<BR>dealt with monks who attacked whatever they felt like; warriors who thought that the word 'tactics' meant makig<BR>sure they had at least half hp before they went to pull ; clerics who thought that healing spells somehow only<BR>worked on themselves; wizards who thought that the answer to mob frenzied on themselves was to burn mana<BR>even faster; and so on, and so forth, all down the line. . the point being, of course, that while good reliable party<BR>members are out there, they are extremely difficult to find. .and they are a requirement for the successfull play of<BR>a buffing enchanter. <P>In short, then -- while I love this class, and doubt I could even feasibly enjoy playing another -- the class suffers<BR>from a hobbling and largely hidden weakness; overall unreliability. (The resist rates are a small part of this, but<BR>are not really central to the problem.) We simply have no way to reliably and efficiently affect combat without<BR>reliance on externals. All classes experience this to a degree. Some, however, experience it to a much higher<BR>degree than others; enchanters, I believe, experience this weakness to the highest degree of any class. As<BR>such, the enchanter experiences a much keener need for a reliable and efficient party in order to advance; and<BR>this, I believe, is the primary cause of the extremely notable discrepancy between enchanter /played times to<BR>level ratios and the /played ratios of other classes. <P><BR>That being said, I don’t think the class is unsaveable. There are a few changes I’d like to see. Here they are, in<BR>short order.<P>I’d like to see the random number generator fixed. I’d like to see Tashan, or at least it’s higher-level equivalent<BR>Tashani, have a very fast casting time and very short delay time on recast. I’d like to see a ten or fifteen second<BR>minimum duration on Charm spells. I’d like to see the memblur series made unresista</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://www.eqportal.com/forum/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000007&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.eqportal.com/forum/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000007&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
