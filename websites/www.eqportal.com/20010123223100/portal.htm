<h1><font color="#FF3333">EQPortal will be down part of the day July 26th for 
  scheduled maintainence. Sorry for the inconvience.</font></h1>
<p>EQPortal is looking for someone with CGI and preferably UBB experience to take 
  over managing our forums. Currently installed on a NT box this will be moved 
  to Linux soon so familiarity with both environments will be helpful. Please 
  note that EQPortal is a nonprofit fan site for hosting EQ pages so this will 
  be volunteer work not a paid position.</p>
<p>The greatest jewelry site on the web is officially no longer to be maintained 
  as Jezra has left EQ. She left it for posterity and I will try to keep it up 
  or see if we have a taker for the role as she requested. I and many wish to 
  thank her efforts to this point.</p>
<p>In the Raves Department.......<br>
  Kudos to Verant for Kunark!<br>
  Overall the Graphics are superb. I have to turn my Clipping (Options menu, Display 
  third page or so) almost to the bottom or the frame rate kills me (My character 
  actually) but even with this the place looks good and every once in awhile I 
  adjust it to the max. for a good look around. Eventually I'll upgrade to more 
  and faster memory and that should fix it. These zones are huge and only Field 
  of Bone seems crowded. However it has gotten somewhat better now that more people 
  are pushing off and higher level. This is because of two good Quests as well 
  as it being the original Bind zone. The zones are apparently running on much 
  better servers as well since I rarely see the lag problems I would expect in 
  other outdoor zones like the Karana's with that many people.</p>
<p>One of the joys of Kunark is that faction is now more of a factor and people 
  are starting to have to decide what to do based on consequences for their actions 
  which enrich the RP aspect of this game. Oh, and so far I have not seen any 
  Iksar Guard killing!<br>
  I do hope to find the Sicken spell to be locally obtainable however instead 
  if us having to buy our 5th level spell from travelers. Higher level spells 
  are fine to travel or quest for but I believe one where your corpse decays to 
  fast to retrieve it are a bit out of line.<br>
  This is going to make me unpopular, but I do think that Iksar monks are too 
  powerful. I have one at 5th level now and a human at 12. The difference between 
  the two at the lower levels is very apparent. Combine regeneration, better AC, 
  infravision, and better stats and we have what I believe to be a superior race/class 
  combo. <font color="#CCCCFF">One anonymous poster said that this only works 
  at lower levels and that Human monks do more damage then Iksar monks. As he 
  was using a fake e-mail address I don't credit it much but perhaps some of you 
  have noticed a difference?</font></p>
<p>Warriors, Shadow Knights, Necromancers, and even Shamans seem to have enough 
  counterbalances to be fair.</p>
<p>Guard Killing Issue.<br>
  <font color="#CCCCFF">Well it has been more then a month since the Verant made 
  their last effort on this issue. Is it enough?</font><a href="Guard.htm"> Guard

  recognized that there are many sites out there with good information and advice 
  but that sometimes finding these sites was hard and time consuming. As the Library 
  of his home in Ak'anon once did he has sought out authors far and wide and attempted 
  to bring many of them under one roof so all can benefit. Classes can talk to 
  and learn from others who share their spells and skills. We can see what our 
  traveling companions needs and abilities are from their peers and share with 
  them what we need and can offer. Thus EQPortal has been created in the spirit 
  of Teamwork.</b></p>
