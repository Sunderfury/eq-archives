    <td width="608" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">One of the enchanter's two starting spells (the other
    being <a href="minor%20shielding.html" target="_self">minor shielding</a>) it is our only
    real attack spell early on.&nbsp; It doesn't do much, but never underestimate its
    use.&nbsp; Early on an enchanter may do little to no damage with a weapon, however the
    ability to cause 4-6 damage comes in quite handy and it hardly hurts that you are
    decreasing your targets strength and agility at the same time.&nbsp; The decrease to
    strength and agility is not cumulative for multiple castings of the spell.<p>This spell is
    most effective early on as a means of catching the attention of desired targets.&nbsp; In
    the rat-race that constitutes the first few levels of play it can be difficult to keep up
    with a monster long enough for your meager combat skills to allow you to actually hit a
    monster and get its attention.&nbsp; With this spell you can target your victim, turn on
    auto-attack, blast it with shallow breath and wait for it to come to you.</td>
