</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left">
    <p>To give you an idea of what we mean by fake items, here is an example below:</p>
    <p> 
      <center>
        <img src="IMAGES/ROBES/Starystat.jpg" width="309" height="126"> 
      </center>
    </p>
    <center>
      <p><img src="images/Robes/starobe.JPG" width="245" height="548"></p>
      <p>I try to include both stats and image of it being weilded/worn<br>
        This is one above of my early works, if you look closly you can tell its 
        fake.<br>
        It used to be the robe of kedge.<br>
        My later works such as the one below arent as easy to tell that its fake:<br>
        <img src="IMAGES/ROBES/goldrobe.jpg" width="284" height="362"><br>
        This one above used to be a cryosilk robe</p>
      <p>And Some of my newest works where i actually drew on armor:<br>
        <img src="IMAGES/ScreenShots/iksarubicite.jpg" width="422" height="403"> 
        <br>
        Its fairly easy to tell that is a fake picture but its hard to draw on 
        armor with a mouse!<br>
        That used to be a screen shot of an iksar in banded type armor</p>
