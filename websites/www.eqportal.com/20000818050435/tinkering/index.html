        <br>
        Today is a great day for us all. The gods of Norrath have
        finally allowed Tinkers to create the Thermal Cloak.
        Gozza was the first to report the finding of the Tattered
        Gnomish Cloak in Sol A on a Clockwork XB in the live
        worlds. Logaan Trainweck of Mithaniel Marr reports to
        have found one on the Bartender, and Malbadon of The
        Rathe has found one on a Goblin Torturer. Wonks Stubbs of
        The Nameless was the first to report that the Tattered
        Gnomish Cloak has an AC of 2 and can only be worn by
        Gnomes. The <a href="ingredients.html">Ingredients</a>
        section has been updated.<br>
        <br>
        I'd also like to announce that Malbadon of The Rathe was
        the first to report the creation of a Thermal Cloak!
        You'll find a picture of a proud Malbadon sporting his
        new cloak in the <a href="cloak.html">Thermal Cloak</a>
        section. The ingredients are as follows:<br>
        <br>
        <table border="0">
            <tr>
                <td><blockquote>
                    <p>1 Tattered Gnomish Cloak<br>
                    1 Firewater<br>
                    1 Metal Rod<br>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>And the statistics for the cloak are as follows:<br>
        <br>
        </p>
        <table border="0">
            <tr>
                <td><blockquote>
                    <p>Weight: 0.7<br>
                    AC 6<br>
                    Save vs Cold +20<br>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Malbadon has a Tinkering skill of 102, and the
        creation of the Thermal Cloak was trivial to him. Others
        that have reported the creation of the Thermal Cloak
        include Wonks Stubbs of The Nameless and Sintin
        Kneekicker of Cazic Thule.<br>
        <br>
        Now's the time to hand out some awards for sharing all of
        this information with the Tinkering community. Gozza will
        receive the award for finding the first Tattered Gnomish
        Cloak in the live worlds. Malbadon of The Rathe will
        receive the award for creating the first Thermal Cloak.
        The award for the Thermal Cloak trivial point will be put
        on hold until some more Gnomes have created Thermal
        Cloaks and the trivial point can be confirmed.
        Congratulations to all! You may find the awards in the <a
        href="goldengear.html">Golden Gear</a> section of the
        Compendium.<br>
        <br>
        On to other news. I've finally finished updating the <a
        href="locator.html">GPS</a>. Please head on over and have
        a look. If you discover incorrect or missing information,
        please let me know. If you sent in a GPS request up until
        today but do not see yourself listed, please write in and
        let me know that too. It's great to see so many Gnomes
        taking up their heritage.<br>
        <br>
        I've removed the Lens of Sort from the <a
        href="curios.html">Curios</a> section as it was
        discovered that this is a Tier-Dal reading spectacle and
        is not involved in Tinkering or Gnomes. Sinrakin
        Shadowshaper of Tarew Marr wrote in with this
        information.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, many of you have written in with recipes to be
        added to the Community Recipes section. This will be the
        next section that will receive a major update, so please
        hang in there. And for those that have written in asking:
        The Community Recipes section holds recipes that cannot
        currently be made in Norrath. Hopefully we'll be able to
        change that :)<br>

        has made it difficult to maintain the Compendium, but I
        believe this is about to change. I just wanted to let you
        all know that I'm still here, and I will make an effort
        to update the Compendium in the next few days. There are
        quite a lot of you that are waiting to be added to the

        organization of the Community Recipes for the purpose of
        sending them onto the gods of Norrath. Hopefully we'll
        see some of them in the upcoming Tinkering upgrade. In
        the next day or so, Knok will be made the moderator of
        the Workbench Tinkering Forum to allow him to organize
        all of our thoughts. I will still be involved in the
        overall project (there are other issues besides more
        recipes). With Knok's help, we should be able to get
        everything back on track.</td>

        <p>I received an interesting letter from a Guide that

                    <br>
                    I am neither a tinkerer, nor a gnome; but I
                    am a Guide who took part in the second Kunark
                    kick-off event which occurred in Everfrost,
                    and included the Personal Heater. I write to
                    you, to hopefully save many honorable
                    Tinkerers from wasting their valuable time
                    and talents on attempting to re-create the
                    &quot;personal heater&quot; item.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Personal Heater was simply a lantern.
                    Nothing more. It's effect was created by the
                    verant GM playing it's role. The loot left
                    after it's destruction was random and created
                    by each GM at his or her discretion.<br>
                    <br>
                    While the attempt to re-create this item
                    speaks volumes about the ingenuity and
                    perseverance of the Gnomish community as a
                    whole, it is a fruitless one.<br>

                    You will forgive me if I ask you to withhold
                    my email address, for obvious reasons.<br>
                    <br>

        <td>Greetings everyone! Well, it has been a busy week for
        me, and I've only just now had a chance to update the
        Compendium. There's a lot to talk about, so let's get
        started.<br>
        <br>
        First off, a lot more Gnomes have been added to the <a
        href="locator.html">GPS</a>. It's great to see so many
        names up there, but it would also be great if more of you
        registered. Even if you are not Tinkering at the moment,
        it's always good to see how many Gnomes are out there.
        I've decided to add my own name to the list even though I
        rarely have time to Tinker items for others (heck, I
        rarely have time to Tinker items for myself.). One note
        about the GPS: I will not put actual prices into this
        section. I would not be able to keep up with the mail
        that this would generate as Gnomes lower their prices to
        compete with others, nor would I want this section to
        become bogged down with price wars.<br>
        <br>
        Not too long ago I reported that I had heard that the
        Rebreather might not need to be placed on the head to
        work. Well, Knok Verst of Karana has written in to state
        that Rebreathers do still need to be placed on the head
        to work.<br>
        <br>
        Muddletupper of Mithaniel Marr has written in with some
        news on the Metal Disk in the <a href="curios.html">Gnomish
        Curios</a> section. Check out the page for the details.<br>
        <br>
        Xila Cloudweaver wrote in to let us know that Gnomish
        Spirits may also be brewed. I've updated the <a
        href="ingredients.html">Ingredients</a> section with this
        information.<br>
        <br>
        Salastil of Tallon Zek has petitioned a GM regarding
        Kozyn not providing information on Big Bynn. Salastil has
        been told that this is currently not working, and should
        be fixed soon.<br>
        <br>
        Two new Gemcutter suggestions have come in. The first is
        from Filitin, who suggests that someone should cast
        identify on a Gemcutter. Sounds like a good idea. Filitin
        also suggest that the Gemcutter be used on a piece of
        glass from a pottery merchant. The second suggestion
        comes from Xyntress of The Rathe who suggests that the
        Gemcutter is used to add gems to clothing. Perhaps this
        would allow tailors to create magically enhanced
        clothing? I've added both suggestions to the <a
        href="cutter.html">Gemcutter</a> section.<br>

        Omnipotus of Cazic Thule wrote in with some information

        Omnipotus' letter:<br>
        <br>
        <table border="0">
            <tr>
                <td><blockquote>
                    <p><em>To: The Illustrious Guild of Tinkers
                    and Inventors, Ak'anon Chapter<br>
                    From: Omnipotus<br>
                    Subject: The Fall of Gear Norther<br>
                    <br>
                    It is with a heavy heart that I must report
                    the most recent accident regarding the
                    Tinkers and the trials we underwent to
                    restore one gnome's hope for the future.<br>
                    <br>
                    It began with a frantic cry coming from the
                    windmills of our beloved Steamfont, as one of
                    our number ran about, seemingly lost, begging
                    for help. His name was Fringle Doon and he
                    was in the midst of completing his greatest
                    creation: a device which would eliminate all
                    hunger from the world. Somehow, though, a
                    foul thief broke into his laboratory and
                    stole the last of the components!<br>
                    <br>
                    Desperately, Fringle begged us to track down
                    the thief, a halfling by the name of
                    Meepenny. Calling upon the impressive forces
                    of those who had gathered at the windmills,
                    we were magically transported to the Misty
                    Thicket, where the hunt for the dastardly
                    rogue began. While I myself am of this
                    illustrious profession, I must say I found
                    myself driven to track her down and retrieve
                    her ill-gotten gains in the interest of
                    furthering the ways of the tinker.<br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, we found her, and she was dispatched
                    with brutal efficiency. Once more, Eldritch
                    winds transported us back to Steamfont, where
                    we raced back to the windmills with the
                    stolen parts.<br>
                    <br>
                    When we arrived, we found Fringle along with
                    his creation, called Gear Norther. Although
                    it resembled the clockworks that roam
                    Steamfont, this one was quite docile..at
                    first. Hurriedly, Fringle completed the last
                    bits of work, and a collective cheer rose
                    from the group. Gear Norther began to move
                    from person to person, distributing food to
                    each of us. Truly a wondrous creation!!<br>
                    <br>
                    During the theft, however, Meepenny must have
                    done something to damage the delicate parts,
                    because suddenly a horrid screeching arose
                    from Gear Norther and it began to shake
                    fiercely. Suddenly, it turned and attacked
                    one of our companions!! It was trying to turn
                    him into food!! <br>
                    <br>
                    With a heavy heart, we drew our blades and
                    lunged into the foray, beating the creation
                    with every ounce of strength. Ultimately, the
                    clockwork fell to our blows, and Fringle's
                    sobs were heard throughout Steamfont. We
                    sought to comfort him in this time of need,
                    and he thanked us for our help, gifting each
                    of us with some gold he had gathered together
                    during his travels.<br>
                    <br>
                    Each of us turned and headed back to our
                    homes, and I could not help but wonder if my
                    tinkering career might meet such an ignoble
                    fate. Can the path of the rogue and that of
                    the tinker co-exist? Must they clash against
                    one another, leaving only death and
                    destruction in their wake?<br>
                    <br>
                    Surely there must be another way...</em></p>

        Gnome Tinkered Toy. Kahnlyn of Povar first wrote in with
        where it may be obtained, and additional information has
        been added by Tinkerten Iktomi of Solusek Ro and Krilen.

        <td>Greetings all! Some interesting news today...<br>
        <br>
        To begin with, it would appear that King Ak'Anon is
        actually a clockwork! Grouchie Grumbles of Solusek Ro
        wrote in yesterday (as have others since, and it has also
        been discussed at the Ak'Anon Bar) that he was called in
        front of the King two days ago to discover that the King
        is no longer using his human illusion. There is now a
        clockwork claiming to be King Ak'Anon himself.<br>
        <br>
        Now, I do not know what the rest of you think about this,
        but I am concerned. While I embrace my Tinker heritage,
        there have been times when I wander the corridors of
        Ak'Anon that I ponder who is really the master of our
        great society. We created the clockworks to help out with
        our common day-to-day tasks such as cleaning, policing
        and commerce. Their creation has allowed Gnomes to focus
        on more intellectual pursuits. However, have we come to
        rely on them to such a great extent that without them we
        would no longer be able to function as a society? Have we
        become a slave to our own inventions?<br>
        <br>
        Now, with a clockwork in a position that we have all
        sworn loyalty to, I can only hope that this incarnation
        is only temporary and that our flesh and blood King will
        return. Perhaps the King currently fears for his life and
        has put a duplicate in his place to draw out the
        attacker? Only time will tell.<br>
        <br>
        On to other possibly disturbing news. Babaaeyen of Povar
        wrote in yesterday (and others have discussed this at the
        Ak'Anon Bar) regarding a discussion with a fellow Gnome
        by the name of Kozyn Gigglephizz. Kozyn was apparently
        looking for any Tinmizer's Fabulous Compactors that may
        have been handed out by Sanfyrd at the scrapyard, and was
        offering a reward. Babaaeyen also mentioned that Kozyn
        was a part of the T.B.I., a group that I had not heard
        of. Given this information, and the fact that I own a
        Compactor, I headed off in search of Kozyn.
        Unfortunately, I was not able to find him (Babaaeyen
        mentioned that Kozyn is usually found in the little room
        next to the exit from Ak'Anon). I decided to go have a
        chat with Sanfyrd regarding the whole situation, and this
        is what transpired:<br>

                    named Kozyn. That is all. Now please go and

        <p>Sanfyrd would offer up no further information
        regarding either the Compactor or Kozyn. Following my
        discussion with Sanfyrd, I decided to check to see if
        Kozyn had returned, and indeed he had. This was my
        discussion with him:<br>

        Now you may be wondering why I felt this was all a little
        disturbing. On the surface, it would seem great that
        someone is willing to trade for an item that no one has
        been able to find a use for. However, the emergence of
        the T.B.I. does cause me some concern. It would appear
        that the T.B.I. has the power to exile any Gnome that has
        been accused of defective Tinkering, without any sort of
        appeal. Have any of you heard of Tinmizer before any of
        this? I certainly cannot find any record of him. He seems
        to have completely disappeared, as if he has never
        existed...<br>
        <br>
        The next time you attempt to Tinker an item, take a look
        over your shoulder. There may be a Gnome watching you
        with great interest...<br>

        about (see April 3rd news item). Unfortunately, due to

        be canceling this event. If there are more that are

        <td>Greetings all! Quite an update today. As you may see
        from the icons above, I've added a couple of new sections
        to the Compendium. The first section is one that I've
        been talking about for the past week. The Gnome
        Positioning System (or <a href="locator.html">GPS</a>)
        has been set up to allow Tinkers to advertise their
        wares. So far, there are only a few entries, but I'm sure
        that I'll soon have a flood of mail once you see how
        valuable this section is. Oh boy, are the Bards of
        Antonica going to love me for this one! I'm sure they'll
        thank me later once they realize how toned they've become
        from lugging around my mailbags.<br>
        <br>
        If you've written in with your support for the GPS in the
        past, please write in again with your registration, as I
        don't necessarily have all of your personal information.
        It would help if you created your mailing with a subject
        of GPS, and be sure to include all of the information I
        listed in the April 3rd news item.<br>
        <br>
        The second new section is one that I've wanted to do for
        a while now. The <a href="curios.html">Gnomish Curios</a>
        section was created to display all of the interesting
        Gnomish items that have been found throughout Norrath.
        Tynk Mindrifter of Mithaniel Marr has done a great job of
        providing most of the information that is in this
        section. If you've come across new items, or know the
        purpose of those already listed, please write in.<br>
        <br>
        And speaking of Tynk Mindrifter, I've decided to create a
        new Golden Gear Award in his honour. The new Furthing
        Gnomish Pursuits award has been created to showcase those
        that have greatly contributed to the community. Check out
        how Tynk has really helped us all in the <a
        href="goldengear.html">Golden Gear</a> section.
        Congratulations Tynk!<br>

        <td>Greetings, and welcome back to the Compendium. Every
        so often, I receive mail from another Norrathian asking
        if it would be possible for us to get together and chat
        about Tinkering. Unfortunately, I never seem to be able
        to find the time to actually do so (sometimes I'm so
        absorbed in my latest invention that I look up from my
        workbench only to realize that another week has gone by).<br>
        <br>
        So, here's my suggestion: perhaps on Thursday April 13,
        we can all meet in a chat room and discuss Tinkering and
        other Gnomish endeavours. It would be an open forum with
        no set agenda. Hopefully some of the Master Tinkers out
        there would join in and lend a hand. Write in and let me
        know your thoughts. If I see that even a handful of
        people are interested, then I'll set it up.<br>
        <br>
        Following my suggestion for a Gnome Positioning System,
        or GPS, last week, a number of you have written in to
        state your interest. I'm sure that as others find the
        section, they'll also want to get involved. With this
        response, I've decided to add it to the Compendium. For
        the moment, there won't be a way for you to automatically
        add yourself (hopefully this will be added at a later
        time). Therefore, if you'd like to be involved, you'll
        have to write in, and allow me time to manually add you
        to the list. It would be good if you included the
        following:<br>
        <br>
        <table border="0">

                        <li>A mailing address if you wish to be
                            contacted outside of Norrath</li>

                            to Tinker for a customer</li>
                        <li>A comment that you'd like to see next
                            to your name. Perhaps where you
                            usually hang out and when you are
                            usually on. Those are just
                            suggestions, and you may include
                            anything you wish. Just be sure to
                            keep it brief.</li>

        <p>To let you know up front, I will not include any
        prices in this list. I do not want this to become a place
        where Gnomes try to out sell each other based on a price
        listed next to their name. As most of you know, I'm open
        to any and all suggestions, so be sure to write in if you
        feel that something is missing or should be changed. Let

        great news item. Over this past weekend, Aradune was
        available to answer any question that us Norrathians had.
        Fortunately, someone asked a question about Tinkering.
        Below is the question, and Aradune's response in bold
        (you may find the answer post <a

        <p>This is great news! Now, from everything that I've
        read, Poison will be upgraded sometime after the
        expansion. This doesn't give us a lot of time to gather
        our thoughts and try to influence the gods in their
        Tinkering direction. In addition to the <a
        href="community.html">Community Recipes</a> section here,
        I'm also trying to get some Tinkering forums going at
        EQPortal so that we may begin to discuss our ideas. Once
        we have our forums, I'll of course add a page to the
        Compendium to record our ideas. This could very well be
        one of the more exciting times for Tinkering. I can't
        wait!<br>

        On to other news: Cibtek of The Tribunal wrote in to
        confirm that the Flameless Lantern is indeed trivial at
        68. Sounds like this issue can be closed. If the trivial
        level was changed at one time, it sounds like it is back
        to where it has always been.<br>
