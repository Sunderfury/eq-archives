    <td width="608" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">Still not a very powerful pet, I rarely used the first
    or second level enchanter pets.&nbsp; I often found it far more rewarding to work without
    a pet, however I have heard enough people claim they found their second level pet to be of
    sufficient help to warrant the potential experience drain to know that mine was a personal
    choice.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    These pets like to taunt your attacker, drawing it off of you and allowing you the ease of
    casting without disruption from damage.&nbsp; At this level the pet does not have
    sufficient life to survive long as a damage shield for you, however, by judicious use of <a
    href="fear.html" target="_self">Fear</a> and damage over time (DoT) spells, like <a
    href="suffocating%20sphere.html" target="_self">Suffocating Sphere</a>, you can find our
    pet quite effective.&nbsp; Pets can do one thing far better than players, which is run and
    hit things without lagging.<p>Words of caution, unlike normal pets these can not be
    commanded to attack or defend you.&nbsp; They are not true pets in that sense, rather,
    they will defend you after you first take damage.&nbsp; Unless you take damage in a fight
    it will not aid in combat, so if grouped with others and you want your pet to help you
    need to get hit at least once.</p>
    <p>Perhaps a bug, perhaps intentional, but if you allow your pet to get the killing blow
    it takes&nbsp; portion of the experience from the kill.&nbsp; If you, or a group member,
    gets the killing blow your animated pet does not seem to take a share of the experience
    from the split.</td>
