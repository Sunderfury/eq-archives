    <TD>With the location of Diamond Dust revealed (thanks to Derkal Pentolite 
      of The Rathe), the Gnome Tinkering community can now focus on the purpose 
      of the Gemcutter. Unfortunately, Gimblestan was a little vague on how to 
      exactly use the Gemcutter. Here are some quotes from Gimblestan's Volume 
      XXXIII:<BR><BR>

      <P>There has been confirmation from Abashi that no items exist that may 
      raise one's skill, so the Gemcutter will not make you more proficient at 
      creating Jewelry. A number of Gnomes have written in with their attempts 
      to use the Gemcutter. Their comments have been listed below. Please, if 
      you can add to this list, <A href="mailto:eqtinker@yahoo.com">write 
      in</A>!<BR><BR>There have been rumours in the past that the Gemcutter is 
      not yet fully functional. As my attempts to obtain an answer from Abashi 
      in the past have failed, I will post a message to the public forum. Please

              <P><EM>I have some information that may lead to the end of the 
              gemcutter mystery... In my travels I have come to many shops and 
              merchants selling rather exotic items. as a young shadowknight who 
              had been blessed with invisibility, I ventured into the town of 
              north freeport and entered a shop, which name I cannot remember, 
              and began looking through the The Items for sale. I was looking 
              for containers to hold my spoils when I saw a small bag named 
              "gemcutters bag". I bought it and found to my dissapointment that 
              only very small items could be placed inside the four slot bag. I 
              also noticed that the bag had a button that said combine. I became 
              quite angry at the fact that I had bought a bag for 15 platinum 
              pieces and quickly sold it to a merchant. When I heard about this 
              mystery that gnomes are experiencing with the gemcutter I ruturned 
              to the store that I bought the bag, which to my dissapointment, I 
              found that they had no gemcutters bags in stock.

              <P><EM>I was approached by someone last night related a curious 
              tale to me. He explained how, having arrived in the Dreadlands by 
              wizards gate, he decided to explore the area just beyond the gate 
              to see what there was to see. After fighting many skeletons he 
              happened upon one inside a building with the name/description 
              Gemcutter Skeleton. He was a warrior of fairly high skill and in 
              his estimation the skeleton was, as yet, still a fair challenge 
              for him even. (yellow to him at 35). <BR><BR>He hasn't seen it 
              since in his wanderings and I reason out that it is a rare spawn 
              or, at the least, one you'll have to wade through a good number of 
              skeletons to find as you remove place holders. Being too small to 
              survive such a combat yet I feel I can do little to check what 
              this could be. Yet, I also know the tinkers of the gnomish society 
              are a curious lot and someone else is bound to succeed where I can 
              not. :) Thank you to Woodee for relating his curious tale to me.

              <P><EM>I took the word anaglyph and looked it up in the 
              dictionary. What I got was this: "1: a scupltured, chased, or 
              embossesornament worked in low relief, 2: a stereoscopic motion or 
              still picture in which the right component of a composite image 
              usu red in color is superposed upon the left component in a 
              contrasting color to produce a three-dimensional effect when 
              viewed through the corespondingly colored filters in the form of 
              spectacles." As far as I can tell, these are basically those old 
              3D glasses with one blue and one red lens. So most likely the 
              gemcutter is used as just another tinkering component placed into 
              the toolbox. The end product would be the anaglyph which would

              <P><EM>After many hours of pondering, I have come up with the 
              following<BR>a) After close reading, many things arise. The first, 
              it said that greased is used to reduce friction, so it must be 
              used WITH the gemcutter. <BR>b) Pearls would also seem to be used 
              in its use.<BR>c) Anaglyphs are mentioned. Pearl Anaglyphs. A 
              glyph is a type of symbol, and I beleive that an anaglyph is a 
              symbol of sorts. An ornament, sculptured or carved. This would 
              make sense. The Gemcutter could make precise cuts, so the pearl 
              could be cut and shaped into an ornament of sorts, like an earing. 
              Here a sketch would not be out of place.<BR>d)Also said that the 
              device is powered by Firewater, so perhaps manipulating a flask of 
              firewater on the Gemcutter will do 
          something.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

              <P><EM>Everyone in the tinkering community seemd convinced 
              (probably because of the name) that the Gemcutter relates to the 
              JEWELRY trade skill. As a smith, I wonder if in fact, it is the 
              missing component long awaited to allow the smithing of enchanted 
              armor and weapons.<BR><BR>The smithing messageboards have been 
              abuzz for months with the fact that the forges in Norrath 
              mysteriously increased from 8 to 10 slots ( room for a 
              gemcutterand grease perhaps? ) The gnomish warriors guild is known 
              as the Gemchoppers, an amazingly similar name, and there are quest 
              armors which require gems for their manufacture in the world. 
              Since there has been no change in jewelcraft contemporaneous with 
              this new tinkering discovery, perhaps this is a worthwhile new

              <P><EM>It seemed to me that a careful reading of Gimblestan's work

              in the OPERATION of the gemcutter, AS WELL AS its construction. 
              Furthermore, the use of grease would say to Me that a jeweler's 
              bag NOT be used...that the toolbox WOULD.<BR><BR>Also, as a master 
              jeweler, I have read statements (I THINK it was Brad) that at the 
              current time, NOTHING will combine in a jeweler's kit other than a 
              gem and a bar of metal. That was in response to many inquiries 
              regarding how a jeweler's kit had FOUR slots and jeweler's were 
              trying to combine countless vain attempts to obtain an item 
              besides the known jewelry. Sorry I can't provide an exact 
              reference to that statement, it was a while ago.<BR><BR>And

              Gimblestan, Tinmizer, Hasten Bootstrutteror obtaining further 
              works of Gimblestan I have questioned all NPC's in Ak'anon zone

      <P>There is quite a discussion occuring on the Tinkering Mailing List 
      regarding the use of the Gemcutter. Many are suggesting that the Gemcutter 
      be used in a Jeweler's Kit with the following ingredients: 1 pearl, 1 
      metal bar (ie: silver), 1 Gemcutter, 1 bottle of grease. I've also read a 
      suggestion of: 1 pearl, 1 ring, 1 Gemcutter, 1 bottle of grease. To date, 
      the above suggestions have not been tried.<BR><BR>Many Gnomes and 
      non-Gnomes have written in suggesting that grease should be used while 
      using the Gemcutter and not just in the creation of it. Such as, when 
      using the Gemcutter in a Jeweler's Kit, include grease too.<BR><BR>Tynk 
      Mindrifter of Mithaniel Marr has suggested that since Gimblestan refers to 
      Pearls found in the Ocean of Tears, perhaps there is a Lore Pearl that may 
      be found in the area. Could the Gnome pirate Toko Binlittle have something 
      to do with it?<BR><BR>Maesyn Shadowdancer of Tunare suggested using Pearl 
      shards (or any shard) with the Gemcutter. While it is known they are used 
      for research, perhaps they have another use.<BR><BR>Vfelia D'var of Tunare

              and armour, but the gnome had a much more interesting story to 
              tell. He told me he was in the jewelling business, and that he had 
              mastered a unique gem cutting technique. He asked me if I needed a 
              stone [cut] or if I needed some jewelry [repaired]. After 
              inquiring about how he was cutting these gems, he told me that he 
              could do it yes, but only to rare or exceptional stones, and asked 
              me what kind of stone I had. I lied, I told him I had every stone 
              I had ever heard of, from malachite to black sky diamonds, but he 
              did not seem interested in and of these. I asked him all about his 
              repair services, and he told me that for a small fee he would 
              repair a piece of jewelry, but that this was more of a hobby of 
              his and would not comment further on it.<BR><BR>This gnome went by 
              the name of Darfumple Zirubbel, his location in the Rathe 
              Mountains is about 5000, 900 (both positive). Perhaps you can

  <TR>
    <TD>Derkal recently (January 21) wrote in with this message. You may find 
      the pictures below.<BR>Needless to say, I have encouraged him to release 
      the location of the dust sooner<BR>rather than later. Only by getting 
      Gemcutters into the hands of many Gnomes will we be<BR>able to determine 
      its function.<BR><BR>

              <P><EM>Rejoice brothers and sisters in that fact that this does 
              exist as the pics show:)<BR>until i figure out exactly how to use 
              the gemcutter i am not going to ask the<BR>finder of the diamond 
              dust for the location. i only have pride in making 
              the<BR>gemcutter and elation that the diamond dust actually does 
              exist. my friend<BR>in the pic found the dust and to him we should 
              all be thankful. he knew that<BR>i had been hunting this and came 
              to me with it first. fear not for the location<BR>will be 
              divulged. ok my question to you my bretheren, "what does it do 
              and<BR>how?". any ideas? it is not a container. im very worried 
              about giving this over<BR>to a jeweler at this point until i can 
              make another. i can also tell you the<BR>diamond dust , at least 
              where this was found according to my friend, is a rare<BR>drop or 
              has been added as of this last patch. until i can aquire another, 
              he<BR>nor i will divulge the location but ask for suggestions here 
              and hope that you<BR>find peace in the fact that its in game and 
              you will find out where. btw it was<BR>trivial at a 122 skill. 
              thank you my friends for keeping the tinkering skill viable<BR>by 
              your support and hard work.

    <TD>Well, Derkal Pentolite has written in once again. This time with the 
      <STRONG>location of Diamond Dust!</STRONG><BR>Have a read of his complete 
      message below. (Update: Derkal has clarified that the gem he used<BR>below 
      was a perl)<BR><BR>

              <P><EM>OK just an update. The first gemcutter to ever be made (i 
              know there are some that have<BR>said they made it but i have 
              never seen any proof of this) is gone. it could not be held<BR>as 
              a pet enhancer would (nor equipped) and Verant has repeatedly said 
              there is no<BR>item to enhance the jewelry making skill. it could 
              not be clicked to produce any effect.<BR>it was not a container to 
              insert a gem. so the only alternative was to have a high 
              level<BR>jeweler (200 skill in this case) to try and combine it 
              with a gem in a jewelers bag. alas<BR>the message "these do not 
              combine to produce..yada yada" came up and the gemcutter<BR>went 
              down. ok it is now my feeling that this is in fact a dummy item 
              and the actual<BR>gemcutter as idealized by Verant has not been 
              implemented. i feel the actual item will<BR>be of a container type 
              construction with one slot. now for the big news.<BR><BR>So that 
              we, the tinkering community, can move ahead with this and in the 
              interest<BR>of a continued alliance and information exchange 
              within our ranks, the diamond dust<BR>was a drop from the ice 
              giant priest in the Vox area. this drop had never 
              occured<BR>before and whether there are other mobs that drop it or 
              if it was a rare drop or (which<BR>is my way of thinking because 
              altho some ppl say they have gotten it but never issued<BR>proof) 
              Verant just implemented this drop in yesterdays patch, i have no 
              idea. i am<BR>going to kill a few of the ice giants outside of 
              perma and see if they also make this<BR>drop. anyway, let our 
              quest continue and may the gods of Norrath aide us in<BR>our 
              endeavor.<BR><BR>Derkal Pentolite, master tinker and nuclear
