  <p>Story about Drosco the zombie : A few days ago I ventured into the aquaduct 
    of Qeynos - I had barely turned around the first corner before I stood face 
    to face with a zombie called Drosco, rather surprised that he did not attack 
    me outright I hailed him, and he then asked me help him - He never said with 
    what he needed help though, but I could easily see it my self ... all those 
    pale bones, and his lone walk in the dark aquaducts. A sudden idea struck 
    me, and I asked him to follow me, I then guided him to the continent of Faydwer 
    where I remembered to have met a lone faerie guard whom also seemed lonely. 
    Again luck smiled at me, and we found her in Lesser Faydark - It was love 
    in first sight between the two, and my heart pulsed of pride and joy. But 
    unfortunately there was problems, he didn't like the open areas, because he 
    had been in the aquaducts for too long, and missed the mood and moist from 
    it. After much discussing back and forth, the faerie guard told us of a graveyard 
    in Butcherblock Mountains, and Drosco thought it to be a good idea to try 
    that area out before heading back to the aquaducts - And what a luck that 
    he did ... he instantainiously fell in love with the place. I took a picture 
    of them after they got there, and just look at the big old happy grin on Drosco's 
    face ... ohhh how sweet love must be, will the wonders of Norrath never cease 
    ?</p>
