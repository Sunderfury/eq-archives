Subject: Another tinkering question- may need testing too.
 
Yakatizma and Ester,

A respected member of the tinkering community, Igbert of Rodcet Nife, made
200 skill in tinkering a few days ago.  Since then, he has made 80 combines,
and has not yet seen skill 201.  Could either of you please verify that it is
possible to go past skill 200 in tinkering?  I know that the change to
tradeskills to go above 200 was fairly recent, and it is possible that
tinkering was not included in this update.  Also, Igbert has no other
skill above 200 (I know that tinkering should be seperate from the other
tradeskills, but you never know... )

Please write back at your earliest convenience.  I'd love to be able to
tell him that it's possible to go above 200... but only if it really is!
 
Thank you,
Kredal and Fizzwizz Cookiegnomie

Currently the racial oriented are still capped at 200 and are excluded
from the specialization code. I'm going to have the cap on tinkering raised to
250. It will still be excluded from the specialization code so regardless
if another skill is raised above 200 it will still be possible to raise
tinkering above 200 as well. I'll try to pull some teeth and see if I can
get in by the patch next week.
