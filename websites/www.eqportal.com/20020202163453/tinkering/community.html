      <p>This is a <font color="#0000FF">WISHLIST</font> of tinkering ideas! This 
        list doesn't actually WORK :) Tinkering is expensive enough without people 
        going out and trying to make these things. They are NOT in the game. Please 
        save your coppers for real stuff :)</p>
      <p>The Tinkering community is an inventive bunch. Many are constantly at 
        their workbench, inventing new gadgets. Every piece of platinum they make 
        goes to buying just one more gear or metal shaft for the latest contraption. 
        Many non-Tinkers don't understand this obsession, and scoff. But the Tinker 
        doesn't hear the remarks, being so absorbed in the work at hand...<BR>
        <BR>
        This page is dedicated to those Tinkers that have put in the effort to 
        invent new gadgets. A lot of thought has gone into ensuring that the items 
        remain balanced within Norrath. The reason: a lot of us would like to 
        see these items in Norrath one day.<BR>
        <BR>
        Most of the information presented here has come from the replies to <A 
      href="abashi.html">Post 16681</A>. Now 
        that that campaign is complete, please post your invention to the Tinkering 
        Forums. Currently, you may reach the forums from here: <A 
      href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/bfulcrumstinkeringforums">Community Forums</A>. From 
        time to time, I will post these new inventions to the official Wishlist 
        forum with the hope that some of them will make it into Norrath.<BR>

            modifications to a previous invention of mine. I call my new 
            creation, the GNOMISH RADAR. I took my regular compass, and replaced 
            the disply with a ruby for a more readable, accurate display. Then, 
            by having a metal rod attatched to the compass pin, it would send 
            out a sound vibration by hitting the large black lodestone I had 
            implemented. All creature-shaped entities would then bounce back the 
            sound, and the device would receive and display the data. Needless 
            to say, I won the competition..."<BR><BR>The device could be made at

          <TD>A powerful firearm invented to frighten away monsters with its 
            loud noise. Still, a direct hit from its blast can prove lethal. A 
            bullet is required to use the Blunderbuss. Naturally the skill level 
            to make this would fall somewhere around 115, and nicely fix the 
            annoying gap between the GemChopper and AquaLung.</TD></TR>

        <TR>
          <TD><FONT size=3>This is just a note to all tinkerers, to mind basic 
            safety principles when working with high explosives inside the city 
            gates. It is also an invitaion for the ambitious to complete the 
            research of 2 of my pet projects. The first is nearly complete, a 
            few more tests and we may have it, the 2nd may be on permanent delay 
            due to my lack of adherence to basic safetey measures. <BR><BR>Heres 
            what happened. Early one sunday morn, while wonder thru Norath, I 
            had a flash of inspiration to build a device that would allow 
            tempory invulnorability to enhance escape from a dire situation. The 
            device I had imagined would be similar to idol the head Ork used to 
            drop in High Hold back in me younger days. I used a rebreather as 
            the basis for my design, since the extreme heat I anticapted would 
            necessitate an automated breathing apperatus. I began with standard 
            rebreather parts, adding to them a large power suply, a left over 
            black box from my ealier land mine expereminents, and a Lava Bolt 
            spell, the Magemechanica guild relunctantly donated for the 
            experiment. I then heisted, no! BORROWED, the copper tubing from the 
            public still and had the armor clockwork drill a hole in the black 
            box and forge the copper tubing to it. As i had done in previous 
            experiments, I mounted the power supply firmly inside the box with 
            gnomish bolts, the switch poking out one end. I then carefully 
            placed the volitile spell inside the box and connected it to the 
            power supply with 2 short pieces of metal twine wrapped in 
            bandages.<BR><BR>It was so exiting! almost test ready. I then 
            fastend the the tube up one side the corla mesh, and assembled the 
            rebreather. next, I mounted the breather on a outdated clock work 
            procured from the city and got set to flip the switch. Well, how was 
            i suposed to know that lava confined in one direction could cause so 
            much damage! After all, I cast the thing on those stupid bugs in in 
            solusek often with little effect! <BR><BR>Well anyways when I 
            flipped the switch, the effect was instantaneous, the lava shot thru 
            the tubes and out between the crack between the mesh and the helm, 
            with such force that it ripped the head clean off the clock work. 
            The copper tubing got so hot that holes burned through it, spraying 
            lava all over the room. The rest of the clockwork melted into a pile 
            of rouble and became welded to the floor. What a mess. Oh, and the 
            civic leaders have now come down on me! Even my guild has is 
            reviewing my possible dissmisal! Naturally noone has noticed that 
            the detached head of the clockwork is still intacked, but 
            WHATEVER.<BR><BR>In any case, I'm done, no longer allowed to tinker 
            inside the city, I am not inclined to bring anymore glory to Akonon, 
            so You all are welcome to the the materials left in my lab. Good 
            Luck!, oh and btw I will not be releasing the blue prints to my 
            automated clockwork transporter!</FONT><BR><FONT
