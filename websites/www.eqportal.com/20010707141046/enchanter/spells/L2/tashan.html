    <td width="608" valign="top" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">One of the banes of every spellcaster is a
    creature's ability to resist the spells cast upon it.&nbsp; Of all who cast, only
    enchanters can make the job easier by lowering their victim's resistance to magic.<p>Another
    great fact about Tashan is its incredibly quick casting time and relatively low mana
    cast.&nbsp; Given a choice between drawing a target's attention with a spell that costs
    20-30 mana and may still fail or using Tashan, many enchanters opt for Tashan.&nbsp;
    Granted, it still may fail, but its quick enough you can get another shot off before they
    hit you if you are at maximum range. &nbsp; I rarely see Tashan fail.&nbsp; Once it does
    succeed, all your other spells have that much greater a chance at succeeding.&nbsp; And
    lets face it, sometimes in over-crowded areas where people aren't too woried about being
    polite, claiming ownership over who has rights to kill something comes down to who draws
    its attention first. &nbsp; Not many spells come close to comparing to Tashan's casting
    time of roughly 1 second.</td>
