<h2>
<i>The Common Sense Raid Rules</i></h2>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<p>Please make sure you have read the following, understand it,
and practice it on raids.
<BR>
<BR>
A raid can be a lot of fun. But it can also be your worst nightmare,
so prepare for it, use common sense and pay attention. And you might just live through
it and not get anybody else killed.
</p>1) <a href="#1">Prepare.</a>
<br>2) <a href="#2">Commitment.</a>
<br>3) <a href="#3">Chatter.</a>
<br>4) <a href="#4">Pay attention.</a>
<br>5) <a href="#5">Basic class rules.</a>
<br>6) <a href="#6">Morale.</a>
<br>7) <a href="#7">Tells to leaders.</a>
<br>8) <a href="#8">Chatter during fights.</a>
<br>9) <a href="#9">A.F.K.</a>
<br>10) <a href="#10">Corpse Recovery.</a>

<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="1"></a><i>Commandment #1: Prepare for the Raid</i></h2>
<FONT SIZE=3>
1) Common knowledge. Print maps of the zone in question. Visit web sites
for info on the zone. You should have enough interest in the game to do these
&nbsp;things on your own. If not, put a little effort into it. If you
don't have a printer then get one, or ask another member
&nbsp;to mail you maps. But don't sit in the dark.
<p>The following sights will be helpful for raid preparation:

of Karana</a>
<br><a href="http://users.telepak.net/~rickyh/mapsbyho.htm">Maps by Hop</a>
<p>&nbsp;2) Snack stock up. Depending on the length of the raid, try to
have snacks and fast prepare food (microwave)
&nbsp;ready and eat/drink at your computer so you are not afk except
for bathroom breaks or cigarettes as the case
&nbsp;may be.&nbsp; :)
<p>&nbsp;3) Turn off ALL battle messages except your hits (so you can see
if you are hitting a mob). You can massivley
&nbsp;reduce battle spam (and read guild instructions better) by doing
this. If you are experiencing reduced frame rate,
&nbsp;turn spell effects off, PC names off, and reduce your clipping
plane.
<p>&nbsp;4) DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT WHERE WE RAID.&nbsp; Plans will change.&nbsp;
The primary raid goals will not always be
&nbsp;available.&nbsp; Be flexible as there may be backup plans you
didn't plan on.&nbsp; It's hard work planning a raid and even
&nbsp;harder when you have to change plans in midstream.&nbsp; This
is the time to exercise patience.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
</FONT>
<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="2"></a><i>Commandment #2: Commit time</i></h2>
1) SHOW UP ON TIME to the raid. This is critical. People waste real life
time waiting on others. It shows real disrespect for your fellow guildmates. 
Also arrange your own ports, and only after trying and failing bother a
&nbsp;raid leader with port details.
<p>&nbsp;Weekend (and some weekday) raids have starting times and locations
posted.&nbsp; Please be at THAT location at
&nbsp;THAT time. Having to wait for people can (and has) caused us
to lose a raid spot to other raiders.&nbsp; Being late to
&nbsp;start will lead to you being counted as late for loot purposes.
Unless you post that you will not be there/be late
&nbsp;for some reason, everyone is expected to be on time.
<p>&nbsp;2) COMMIT TO THE HOURS. DO NOT ever go on a raid unless you can
commit to the worst case scenario.
&nbsp;Don't think you can start a raid and leave shortly after. If
15 people spend 2 hours getting into a plane only to
&nbsp;have you leave an hour or so after, then what is the point? 
Please try to avoid having to leave mid raid,
as it can (and has) caused a significant disruption.&nbsp; We
&nbsp;know that Real Life emergencies come up that require people to
leave, and that's OK.&nbsp; But we can't let it become
&nbsp;a habit of people having to go mid raid.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="3"></a><i>Commandment #3: No Spam</i></h2>
&nbsp;The difficulty of the raid is directly proportional
to the amount of chatter that is allowed.
&nbsp;The harder it is, the less there should be.
<p>&nbsp;1) /ooc, /shout should be for pullers or raid leader CRITICAL
instructions. When you see that colored text it's
&nbsp;important (or guildchat if that channel is being used).
<p>&nbsp;2) Guild chat should be used for raid specific questions / suggestions.
<p>&nbsp;3) Group say or private tells are for personal, non-raid issues
or goofing off.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="4"></a><i>Commandment #4: Pay Attention</i></h2>
&nbsp;1) GENERAL. This should be fairly easy to do a) if you aren't self-absorbed
in goof off chatter during the raid and
&nbsp;b) you simply pay attention to the raid chat channel. Nothing
is more frustrating than people missing main assist
&nbsp;re-assignments, or other critical information, and the raid leader
having to repeat themselves multiple times.
&nbsp;You are supposed to be paying attention to what is going on around
you, and you are responsible for that material.
<p>&nbsp;2) MOB PLACEMENT. If mobs are being pushed into bad places like
walls, ceilings or to other mobs, back off and reposition.
<p>&nbsp;3) LEADER INSTRUCTIONS. If the leader says something, do it. You
will improve your odds of seeing this with
<br>&nbsp;reduced raid chatter and personel tells.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="5"></a><i>Commandment #5: Adhere to Basic Class Rules</i></h2>
&nbsp;Casters: DO NOT chain cast to try to get the kill for experience.
Raids are not for experience. They are for loot
&nbsp;and keeping the other members alive.
<p>&nbsp;Clerics: Don't tank or nuke unless instructed to. Your job is
to heal and buff.
<p>&nbsp;Tanks: Set assist hotkey to the main assist. DO NOT hit anything
till you get an assist, and even then check to
&nbsp;be sure it's right. Hit assist multiple times in a fight to ensure
proper targets. Ideally you will hit it every few
&nbsp;seconds as you would any other hotkey.
<p>&nbsp;Buffing: Buff people and set a timer, so you can re-buff without
everyone asking.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="6"></a><i>Commandment #6: Maintain Morale</i></h2>
&nbsp;DO NOT lower moral in any way on a raid. Doing so is counter-productive
to your own well-being. Ways to lower morale that
<br>&nbsp;should be avoided:
<p>&nbsp;1) Whining about loot/experience.&nbsp; Not all classes get 
&nbsp;loot from all locations. Nobody wants to hear
&nbsp;you whine that you never get the loot you are after.&nbsp; Save
that for the message boards - NOT the raid.&nbsp; If more
&nbsp;than two groups are needed, it's highly unlikely experience will
split well.&nbsp; PLEASE DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT
&nbsp;EXPERIENCE WHILE ON A RAID.
<p>&nbsp;2) Complaining in general. Don't complain openly unless it's really,
REALLY important. Take it to tells with the raid
&nbsp;leader.
<p>&nbsp;3) Don't tell the pullers what mobs to pull on raids.  All of us have
items out there that we would like to have.  Please don't be greedy.
<BR>
<p>&nbsp;4) Mistakes will happen. Never ever beat people down for mistakes
during a raid. We will all make them. Move
&nbsp;on. Only after the raid, do you discuss it.
<p>&nbsp;5) Arguments. There will be NONE. Not one. Don't get short tempered
with others and start fights. It's a high
&nbsp;stress situation and that only makes things worse. You have a
problem? Take it to private tell, or chat/message
<br>&nbsp;board after the raid, and after you have cooled down.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="7"></a><i>Commandment #7: Don't Harrass the Leaders</i></h2>
&nbsp;The raid leader(s) are busy. They have to read everything and stay
on top of it all. Do not send them tells unless
&nbsp;it's critical. Do not waste their time with something someone
else can answer. Remember they are a focal point
&nbsp;and get a lot of traffic.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2> 
&nbsp;<a NAME="8"></a><i>Commandment #8: Chatter</i></h2>
&nbsp;Please do not talk or carry on conversations during fights unless 
it pertains to the fight.  This also pertains to Commandment #3.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="9"></a><i>Commandment #9: Avoid A.F.K.</i></h2>
&nbsp;Please don't go afk unless it's important. Use common sense.
If several people are already afk, do what you need to then as well, 
&nbsp;so everyone can get it out of the way.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
&nbsp;<a NAME="10"></a><i>Commandment #10: Stay for Corpse Recovery</i></h2>
&nbsp;If things go south and there is a large CR, PLEASE try and stay for it.
CR's are very stressful and require patience.
