                <br>
                I've added some detail to each of the regions
                located within the Kingdom of Ak'Anon. I hope you
                enjoy reading them. You may find them in the <a
                href="territory.html">Territory</a> section. I am
                hoping that everyone that decides on the Ak'Anon
                region will also decide on a region within the
                Kingdom. You could pick one for your birth, and
                another for your current residence (or they could
                be the same).<br>
                <br>
                Once the government is in place, I believe we
                should do a Kingdom census to get a feeling for
                the population. Perhaps some of the questions
                would include:<br>

                <td colspan="2">Greetings and welcome to the new
                Kingdom of Ak'Anon site.<br>
                <br>
                Within this site you will find a proposed system
                of government for the Ak'Anon region. I present
                it for your consideration and look forward to
                hearing your comments. Please be sure to post all
                comments to the Ak'Anon forum.<br>
                <br>
                First off, after you've taken a look, it would be
                great if we can discuss the ideas located within.
                To do so, be sure to head over to the Ak'Anon
                forum. Let me know what you like and what you
                don't. It would also be interesting as to where
                you see yourself within the Kingdom.<br>
                <br>
                I'd like to also stress that I don't see the
                Kingdom of Ak'Anon as only a Kingdom for Gnomes.
                While it is true that Gnomes will likely make up
                the majority of the populace, the non-aggression
                ideals of the Gnomes allow for other races to
                participate in the government. All that would be
                required is to swear allegiance to King Ak'Anon.<br>
                <br>
                Perhaps you're a Wood Elf that has moved to the
                Territory of Lesser Faydark to study at the
                Observatory. With your studies now over, you've
                decided to make the Territory home, and run for
                Regent.<br>
                <br>
                Or you're a dwarf that has worked in the mines of
                the Solusek Eye Territory for most of your adult
                life, and consider it your home. With the recent
                move to a Parliamentary system, you have decided
                to run for Regent, or perhaps as the Lord of the
                Ak'Anon Order of Miners.<br>
                <br>
                Hopefully some thoughts to get the discussion
                started...<br>
