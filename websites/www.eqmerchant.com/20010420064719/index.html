                                <P>I’m baaaaaack...While I was away, worked on the dwarven smithing page and got it about half way done... with a new format, so look for that to come real soon. 
                                     My RL stuff has/is/will be taking quite a bit of time away from my playing, so I might not be updating this site much for a bit.  I’ll do my best to bring information your way ;).</P>
                                <P>On the subject of the banded/chain upgrade, a book was found in Mistmoore that has some ingredient information in it for “ornate chainmail”. 
                                     It looks as if the HQ ring recipe (that is necessary for ornate chainmail) is broken for smithing in normal forges.&nbsp; However, HQ rings are able to be made in the human cultural forge (assuming you’re a human).&nbsp; From there on, no-one has been able to make it.  I’ll bring more information when it comes.
                                </P>
                                <P>People have been clamoring for a stat chart for armor... I’m working on one now.</P>
                            </UL>

                                <P>Ok damnit... had a catastrophic computer failure this week, and haven’t even been able to play Everquest :(&nbsp; So, that’s why I’ve been so silent... ALSO, I’m leaving tomorrow morning for a vacation... will be 
                                    gone for a week.&nbsp; So don’t expect too much to be posted new on the site until a week from now.&nbsp; I promise I’ll work on some new sections while I’m playing in Jamaica (Riiiiight)</P>
                                <P>You’ll notice the ad banner (how can you miss it... heh... ) 
                                     That ad banner is making it possible for me to bring this site to you and for me to pay for the bandwidth eqmerchants.com uses.  Please support our sponsers if you see something you’re interested in.&nbsp; That way I’ll be able to do more and more cool things with the site and expand it to be the one source for information that I want it to be.  For example, I have a bunch of pictures waiting to post... but couldn’t do it until I had some monetary help for the bandwidth... now you’ll see alot more stats, more dye/cultural pictures... blah blah blah.... ;)
                                </P>
                                <P>Anyways, thanks for visiting.&nbsp; I hope you find this the resource I was hoping I had when the new smithing changes went live.</P>
                                <P>OH... AND... in case you haven’t see it yet... get a LOAD OF THIS:  (posted to the everquest boards last night)</P>

                                    pageviews rose another 1200 yesterday from 3800 to 5000 (32% increase), my bandwidth only rose from 116Mb to 137Mb  (18% increase).&nbsp; At least it’s not doubling anymore.. heh.  I’ll keep you posted on the

                                <P STYLE="text-align: left;">Ahhhh... the sweet smell of success.  We’ve done well!  Our hits have been going up quite well all week, 
                                    so this morning, I went to go check my web stats.&nbsp; What a little surprise I got.  You little buggers have 
                                    been very busy checking out all the new pages I put up, and all the new links and such.... hmm... page views.. Monday was 832... not bad... Tuesday was 1093... not bad at all... we’re rising about 200 every 
                                    day!... Hmm... what is that HUGE bar on Wednesday... Whhaaaa?&nbsp; How did we get to 3824?!?!? </P>
                                <P STYLE="text-align: left;">Obviously everyone loved yesterday’s update.  Obviously, my current hosting situation isn’t going to work 
                                    for much longer.  From the early stats from today, we got more traffic today than yesterday, which means 
                                    that today, my traffic quota is reached at my provider and I’m paying 10cents per megabyte.&nbsp; Not what I 
                                    expected at all... So, from here on out, I’m paying about 15 bucks a day.&nbsp; Not a good money situation to be in ;)</P>
                                <P STYLE="text-align: left;">What to do... what to do... </P>
                                <P STYLE="text-align: left;">Option 1: sign up with someone like CNet or XRGaming... I have tried this route, and so far no takers... I 
                                    had already fired off a few e-mails about getting banner ads/hosting at a site that can defray the costs of the page because I knew that eventually we would need something like that, and CNet has turned me 
                                    down because they aren’t taking ANY sites related to games because they have too many sites already.</P>
                                <P STYLE="text-align: left;">Option 2: get a better hosting plan.  Already done... with the Earthlink starter site, I get 500mb of 
                                    bandwidth transfer and it’s 10cents per megabyte after that (to give you an idea, yesterday was 112 megabytes).&nbsp; I am switching it now (takes about 3-5 days) to the Earthlink Enhanced Web Hosting site, 
                                    which gives me 4 gigs of bandwidth for $50... and 10 cents per mb after that.&nbsp; If I STAY at my current rate, I’ll hit 3.6 gigs... this doesn’t leave me much ceiling ;)</P>
                                <P STYLE="text-align: left;">Option 3: lower the amount of bandwidth per user.&nbsp; Working on it... the version of the site you see now will 
                                    have the pictures hosted on my personal account on Earthlink... I’m hoping this gives me enough time to 
                                    effect the transfer of Option 2 so I don’t get charged up the yin-yang for it.  I think I’m also going to lower 
                                    the graphics on the page... I really don’t want to do this, but I’m afraid I don’t have much of a choice.&nbsp; Also, the dye picture section is going to lose all the extra graphics around the characters (the 
                                    backgrounds that you see in each picture)... I think that will significantly lower the amount of graphics bandwidth.  Also, rollovers=extra 4K per button = bad = gone.</P>
                                <P STYLE="text-align: left;">Anyone have any good ideas about this?  I’m kinda at a loss.. I have no problem paying a bit for the site... 
                                    I thought $20/month was a cool deal... kinda like a hobby, and a subject I enjoy.&nbsp; $50 is a bit pricey... not 
                                    sure I want to continue it... I’m kinda wary about most banner companies... I tried to apply for one that I thought looked good... but they turned me down (they said they weren’t accepting any more game sites.)  
                                    I’m sure as hell not going to put ghetto casino ads or pron site ads on here... Anyone know of a good banner company (that pays CPM?) or hosting site that will take a fledgling site on?&nbsp; I purposely haven’t 
                                    posted the URL very many places because I was afraid of getting all this bandwidth before I was able to pay for it ;)</P>
                                <P STYLE="text-align: left;">I dunno... well... I didn’t think I would say this before... but I hope you guys don’t visit me too much in the next few days..&nbsp; LOL</P>

                                <P>Well, I’ve spent the past 4 weeks browsing around the entire web, looking at the numerous message boards (some with amazingly short message retention times) and looking at the web sites like 
                                    Allakhazam’s, EQ Casters, and EQ Traders for the new blacksmithing information.</P>
                                <P>I kept on telling myself, I wish there was on place that I could go that would tell me everything, give me a message board to discuss it on, and integrate that message board content back into the main site.&nbsp; 
                                    Hence, the idea for EQ Merchants.&nbsp; I’m a tradeskill junky by heart, from Ultima Online to Everquest and I hope that this resource will be useful to other people interested in tradeskills.</P>
                                <P><B><I>DISCLAIMER:</I></B>  I just want to make it clear that a ton of research was done by the people on Test Server, 
                                    by the people who are with the various web sites, by the people who submit information to them, and by the people who post to the various message boards.  This site was meant as a place to bring ALL of 
                                    those resources into one place.&nbsp; Very little in this site was originally researched by me, or originally found by me in Everquest.&nbsp; I owe kudos and gratitude to the people from <A

                                    who have posted to boards that I have gotten information from.  Also, all the formatting, and display of the information has been created by me.&nbsp; There will be no copy-and-pasted information here.</P>
                                <P>I want this site to be a good resource for everything related to Everquest Trade skills, but my main interest 
                                    is blacksmithy.&nbsp; If you’re interested in making a guide for another trade skill, then by all means please 
                                    send it to me.  I’m doing this in my spare time, and since I have a software company to run, I might be a bit stretched at times - but I will try my best to keep this site updated as much as possible!</P>
                                <P>Bear with me as I start to collect information and put it in all the categories.  If you see something that is not correct on the site, PLEASE e-mail me and let me know.</P>
