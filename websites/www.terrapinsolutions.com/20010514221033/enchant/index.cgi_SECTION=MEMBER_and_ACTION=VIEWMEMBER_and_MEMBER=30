<TR><TD COLSPAN=4><FONT FACE=Helvetica,arial COLOR=000066>My story begins in the city of felwithe,  Where I was born, I knew I was special then, I could do things that others could not. I was taught to use this gift to help others, and protect my family and friends. I had dreams and visions I could not explain, I dreamt of far away places, and dreaming of my first big adventure. I was told to stay close to the city by my mother. Father came back once and again to bring food and strange items. I believe he was not fully happy with me. I am sure he wanted a Son he could fight by his side in his battles. My Father a great Warrior, wouldnt talk too much, Somedays he would come home very Solem. Looking very weary, He sometimes Would ask me to leave so he could be alone with mother. I was sad that he spent more time talking to mother than I. Mother taught me how to work with Jewelry, her hands wer so Skilled, I was Jealous because of my clumsiness kept on ruining the stuff I was working with. But mom always smiled and praised me anyway. Somedays she would take me to the store to work with her and I would clean and try and listen to customers tales of distant places but they spoke in languages I was not familiar, Ususally they spoke only enough Common tongue to buy some goods and supplies. Winter came and My mother soon had become Pregnant again. I was excited that I would have a brother or sister soon. Father stayed out longer and longer, till the time was close. But for me there would be no Joy. I could feel something wrong, even before I could hear My father Scream inside. Inside, my heart shattered and I fell to the ground sobbing. I knew that mother and my sister had not made their Journey safely. I never saw my dad cry before. but we both did. The days went on, Dad was even more solem than before. He would not come home for days on en</TD></TR>
