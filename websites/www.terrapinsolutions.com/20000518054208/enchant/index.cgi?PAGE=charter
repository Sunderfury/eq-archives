<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>ENCHANTED CIRCLE CHARTER</B></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
The Enchanted Circle is an EverQuest guild dedicated to the Enchanter class. Our guild is cross-server and admits enchanters of all races, transcending racial hatred in guild matters. We are dedicated to the five <FONT SIZE=3><B>cornerstone</B></FONT> virtues of our guild, which are <FONT SIZE=3><B>enlightenment</B></FONT>, <FONT SIZE=3><B>exploration</B></FONT>, <FONT SIZE=3><B>education</B></FONT>, <FONT SIZE=3><B>community</B></FONT> and <FONT SIZE=3><B>entertainment</B></FONT>.
<P>
Only enchanters are allowed among our ranks, and the members of our guild may choose whether or not to wear the guild name in EverQuest (some may choose to be in several guilds and we do not begrudge them that).  Our guild does not exist to simply find friends with which to adventure (although that will certainly happen), but to provide a <FONT SIZE=3><B>bond</B></FONT> between the enchanters of the game, for we believe that our craft is among the hardest to master.
<P>
The strength we lack alone we will find in the <FONT SIZE=3><B>solidarity</B></FONT> of our guild.
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=FF2222><B>ENLIGHTENMENT</B></FONT><BR>
The quest for knowledge is at the very heart of our guild.  We seek to attain knowledge of our world and to pass that knowledge in a <FONT SIZE=3><B>careful</B></FONT> and <FONT SIZE=3><B>thoughtful</B></FONT> way to others.  It is our belief that through the acquisition of knowledge beneficial to our class, and the dissemination of that knowledge to members of our guild, we can assist them in becoming not just excellent enchanters, but <FONT SIZE=3><B>excellent people</B></FONT> as well.
<P>
All members of the guild shall be obligated to help explore our world and attain the knowledge of which we seek.  Similarly, all members of our guild are entitled to receive knowledge which continues to elude them, despite their best efforts.  We do not believe in giving knowledge to one who is not ready, or to one who has not tried to acquire that knowledge for themself, for <FONT SIZE=3><B>knowledge is power</B></FONT>.  Knowledge and power achieved through effort rather than simply given teaches <FONT SIZE=3><B>respect</B></FONT> for that knowledge and power.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=FF2222><B>EXPLORATION</B></FONT><BR>
Our world is vast.  We can not afford to ignore the potential locked deep within the world in which we live.  We believe strongly in the exploration of our world.  Exploration leads to enlightenment and also to the education of others.  It also contributes to the <FONT SIZE=3><B>growth</B></FONT> of the individual who has decided to leave home in search of far off lands.  It cannot be described how important exploration is to our guild.
<P>
In addition to exploring our world, we need to explore our craft.  Enchantment is a very subtle craft, and requires <FONT SIZE=3><B>constant exploration and study</B></FONT> to master.  Our guild grows stronger as our members explore and find new knowledge, for it is knowledge, not muscle, that defines our art and our guild members.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=FF2222><B>EDUCATION</B></FONT><BR>
We are few in a crowd of many, yet we have <FONT SIZE=3><B>strengths</B></FONT> as a class that cannot be overstated.  It is to our benefit to educate our fellow citizens in the ways of enchantment.  Often we are scorned for our weaknesses, instead of lauded for our strengths.  We seek to change that, and will be the <FONT SIZE=3><B>catalyst</B></FONT> of that change.
<P>
We shall find ways to educate strangers.  By educating them about enchanters, about our art and about ourselves, we shall convert them to friends.  And when our friends seek our help and desire our company on long and dangerous journeys, then we shall know we have succeeded.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=FF2222><B>COMMUNITY</B></FONT><BR>
The voice of an individual is lost in a sea of voices.  The <FONT SIZE=3><B>collective voices</B></FONT> of a community are not so easily ignored.  Our community provides support, a sense of comraderie, a purpose and most importantly a <FONT SIZE=3><B>strong presence</B></FONT> in the game which none of us alone could hope to achieve.
<P>
The guild exists for the benefit of the members which it serves, and the community it fosters is perhaps the most important facet of its existance.  It is also quite possibly the <FONT SIZE=3><B>biggest benefit</B></FONT> and resource that members can make use of, and the main reason people will want to become part of the guild.
<P>


<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=FF2222><B>ENTERTAINMENT</B></FONT><BR>
Last but certainly not least, let it be known that enchanters know how to have a good time!  We are happy hearty folk and our guild embraces and nourishes these qualities in us all.  <FONT SIZE=3><B>Let the ale flow and let the fun begin!</B></FONT>  The guild will sponsor many events and interesting trips to keep boredom at bay and our hearts and minds uplifted.  And are we not a great source of pyrotechnic displays when we've had a few too many drinks?
