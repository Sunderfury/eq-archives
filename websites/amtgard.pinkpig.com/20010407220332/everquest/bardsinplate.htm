It's a question that has plagued Bards for nearly eternity.  To answer this question, let's take a look inside the thoughts of a couple of random Bards... <br>It is a hot day in Qeynos, at Crow's Pub and Casino.  At a table near the wall, Luti and his Paladin friend play King's Court.  Nearby, at another table, Kitasi, a stunningly handsome bard, drinks alone, something he's trying to rectify apparently, judging by the warm smiles he flashes at every pretty serving wench.  </I>	   <p><IMG SRC="knifig1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=276 WIDTH=123 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Knight in Plate.">I am Luti, a 4th generation Bard.  My friend Windraven, a Paladin, and I,daily go out to rid Qeynos Hills of the evil gnolls.  I am wearing Leatherarmor because that is what my father and his father before him always wore.Windraven has a suit of Plate handed down from his grandfather.  When we goout to hunt the gnolls, Windraven has to protect me.  His platemail easilyturns back the rusty weapons of the Blackburrow gnolls.  But the same swordsbite deeply into my Leather tunic.  I wish I was able to wear the Plate.<p>So one day Windraven and I are down at Crow's playing some cards.  It was ahot day and Windraven decided to take off his armor.  After another flash ofmead, Windraven had to "excuse" himself yet again. Looking at his Plate, Idecide to see what it feels like to wear it.  So I remove my Leather bootsand put on his Steel Plate Boots.  Wow, these would protect my feet muchbetter when Fippy steps on them.  And they don't affect my singing orinstrument playing at all.  Then I put on the Platemail Helm.  It is heavy,but the faceplate is open, allowing easy access for my flute and brass horn.I try on the rest of the pieces and they feel great.  The Breastplate flexesenough for me to get deep breaths needed for my songs.  The Plate Girdleactually has a hook for me to hang my drum on.  The leg, back and neckpieces don't interfere with any of my abilities.<p>Only with the Plate Gauntlets do I see any difficulties.  I can't see howI'd play my instruments with these guantlets on.  I thought the same aboutmy Leather gloves when I tried playing my Lute.  But with much practice, Iwas able to manage.  Maybe I could manage to practice and learn to play withthese Gauntlets too.<p>I hear a great laughter behind me.  Windraven is rolling on the floor.  Hesays "Silly Bard, you can't wear Plate".  "Why not?" I ask.............<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="celticknotsbar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=576 ALT=" "></CENTER><p>Kitasi sat back, enjoying another bottle of fine elven wine.  If only he couldget that pretty red-haired serving girl to join him things would be evenbetter.  He flashed her a smile as she passed, just to let her know he wasready for another drink.<p><IMG SRC="reyn2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=256 WIDTH=175 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Reyn, a Bard." hspace=2>As he waited for her to return he turned his gaze to the pair of adventurersplaying King's court over by the wall.  A tall burly type all decked out inplate and his stylish friend with a drum by his chair.  A fellow bard hewondered to himself?  He noticed that the warrior type was drinking ratherheavily, and sweating nearly as much.  <p>Kit watched amusedly as the burly one removed his armor piece by piece.  IfI made a lass wait that long in the evenings, her ardor would surely cool.Still, perhaps it might have its uses, twas surely flashy enough.  Then tohis amazement, while the warrior answered the call of Tunare, the other barddecided to try on the plate for himself!<p>As Kit watched the other bard put on the Great steel helmet, hmmm that wouldmake it difficult to see my rakish good looks, not to mention ruining thosewindswept locks.  Still it would deflect a gnoll's mace well...  Thebreastplate, keep one from getting poked by a spear perhaps, but what's thepoint of having a flawless chest and tight abs if the ladies can't seethem...  The guantlets???  Right out he thought to himself, playing amandolin is tricky enough in snakeskin, the cost in strings alone would makethose gauntlets seem cheap by comparison.  Boots???  Well I suppose it wouldmake you less likely to be trod upon by clumsy barbarians coming off theship, but how would he sneak deep into the lair of the Splitpaw clanholdwith those things on, for that matter with any of it on.  <p>Kit sighed as the other bard seemed enamored with the feel and weight of thenewfound protection.  Yes he thought, it would well keep you from sword andclaw, but so would guile and magery.  Perhaps that might suit him thoughtKit as he led the pretty redhaired lass upstairs, twirling a key around hisfinger; but give me the freedom to move and I'll be happy to let the bruteskeep their plate.  I have better armor he laughed, my rapier wit, keenintellect, and rakish good looks.  True the Splitpaw don't appreciate them,but then again only Ren Rexx ever saw them, and he only briefly...<p></FONT><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 alt=" "></CENTER><!--Thank you everyone....--><table><TR><TD><a href="http://www.anybrowser.org/"><img src="../bards/anydamn2.gif" align="middle" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=88 alt="View me with Any Damned Browser!"></a></TD><TD><center>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq - Master Bard</A><br>With special research assistance by Talies on Bristlebane<br>  And special thanks to Kitasi and Luti for their kind permission to reprint these wonderful stories.</center></TD><TD><a href = "http://www.hippie98.com/"><img border=0 src="../bards/hiptag98.gif" align="middle" alt="Created with Hippie!" width=105 height=35></a></TD></TR></table><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><p><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="../bards/back2bards_bw.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the Bard's Guild."></A><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " width=25 height=1 border=0><A HREF="eqbard.htm"><IMG SRC="back2eq_green.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the EverQuesting Bard."></A><p align=right><!-- Last modified on Sun Jun 13 19:04:48 1999 --></BODY></HTML>
