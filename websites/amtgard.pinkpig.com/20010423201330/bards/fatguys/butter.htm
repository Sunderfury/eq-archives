(See <A HREF="knaeckebroed.htm">Oh Knaeckebroed</A>). This last double wars, we had about eight Fat Guys together in the hall. It was about 3 in the morning and the conversation was getting pretty bad. The beer we had brought down from the camp was gone, and we were drinking the mystery booze that Cormack and Sigismund had brought. As always the subject of holey/flat side came up. I was at my best/worst that night and came up with a logic train of why the holey siders were into sex and the flat siders were a-sexual. I came up with the line that I was very much interested in plugging up holes, Fat Guy Freiderich and myself came up the chant &quot;Plug that Hole!&quot;  When I woke up that morning (in very bad shape, I should known better than to drink what Cormack and Sigismund were drinking), I was hoping  that  nobody remembered the Chant from the previous night. But as I walked across the encampment in search for coffee, I greeted with chants of &quot;Plug that Hole!&quot; <p>Guilty.  <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="limerick.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Fat Guy Limerick Chorus)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="killhim.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (I Don't Know How to Kill Him)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">92</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
