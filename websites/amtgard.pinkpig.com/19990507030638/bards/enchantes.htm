Most Enchantes are limited on how they may be played.  The styles it may be played or sung are marked with symbols:<p><IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."> - May be played on stringed instruments.<br><IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."> - May be played on percussion instruments.<br><IMG SRC="icon_recorder.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=49 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."> - May be played on wind instruments<br><IMG SRC="aninote.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=20 ALT="May be sung."> - May be sung.<br><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."> - May be chanted.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><p><font size=+1><B>Hodierna's Lilt - </font>1st Circle</B> <IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>  This is the very first Enchante a Bard is taught.  It may be played on either stringed or percussion instruments.  When played, it increases the healing ability of all listeners in the room.  It is a very useful enchante - one used by Bards both young and old.  It is especially loved by Empaths, because of its effect on fatigue and vitality.<p><font size=+1><B>Eye of Kertigen - </font>2nd Circle</B> <IMG SRC="aninote.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=20 ALT="May be sung."><br>  When a Bard gains the second circle, he is taught to sing Eye of Kertigen (contrary to what the Guildmasters say, it may not be chanted).  This enchante only affects the Bard singing it, but it enhances the perception, and at higher circles, gives the Bard the ability to sense hidden and invisible people, which is marked by other's seeing an "eye" flare on the singer's brow.<br>  As with most Enchantes, you may not begin this song while in the same room as another Bard who is singing it, however, if you are already singing this Enchante, it does not "clash" with other Bards singing it.  A very useful Enchante, and one you will find large numbers of Bards singing for lengthy periods of time.  <p><font size=+1><B>Faenella's Grace - </font>4th Circle</B> <IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  At fourth circle, Bards learn this mesmerizing chant to assist them with teaching others.  Like the Eye, the Grace may be started in another room, and still carried on in the same room as another bard chanting it.  The strength of this enchante is partly what makes Bards so notorious as excellent teachers.  <p><font size=+1><B>Rage of the Clans - </font>6th Circle</B><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  At sixth circle, a Bard may begin to chant the Rage.  The power of this enchante imbues all listeners with greater fighting skills.  Be careful where you use it, though, as I'm told some creatures also gain the fighting bonus from this Enchante.<p><font size=+1><B>Redeemer's Pride - </font>8th Circle</B><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  Another chantable enchante, Redeemer's Pride strengthen's a listener's will against fear.  Though there are, as yet, few fear-inducing creatures, it is believed that this may some day prove to be one of the most valuable enchantes in a Bard's library.  Bards learn this at eighth circle. <p><font size=+1><B>Drums of the Snake - </font>11th Circle</B> <IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>  An enchante designed (obviously) for percussion, this rhythm increases one's chances with all survival skills.  It affects everyone in the room.  This is a particular favourite of Rangers and members of the unseen guild.  It is learned at eleventh circle.<p><font size=+1><B>Albreda's Balm - </font>14th Circle</B><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  Learned at the fourteenth circle, this chant is designed to calm the fury and soothe the savage beast.  It will affect anyone not joined to the chanter, if they should fail a contest of wills.<p><font size=+1><B>Meraud's Blessing - </font>17th Circle</B><IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>  At 17th circle, Bards can begin to play Meraud's Blessing on either stringed or percussion instruments.  It enhances the harness ability of all who can hear it.  <p><font size=+1><B>Nexus - </font>20th Circle</B><IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>  With 20th circle, Bards learn this powerful enchante for strings and percussion.  It's potent melody can increase the magic in the area.  It especially emphasizes elemental magic.  A popular one, but very fatiguing to perform, and difficult to keep up.<p><font size=+1><B>Eillie's Cry - </font>24th Circle</B><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  Nobody knows who Eillie is, or how her(?) Cry works after death, but nevertheless, a stricken Bard may chant this to show other Bards within range where her body lies.  Be careful, however, for this chant will significantly reduce the amount of time your spirit has on this plane before you must depart.  It is taught at 24th circle.<p><font size=+1><B><I>River of Time - </i></font>28th Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  At 28th circle, a Bard can learn River of Time.  Our guildmasters claim that it cuts in half the roundtimes of any listeners.  It is chanted, but currently does not appear to function.  Our Great Mage, Lasca, has told us that it will be moved to a higher circle (most probably 75th) when it is fixed.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Glythtide's Joy - </font>28th Circle</i></B><i><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  This chant is planned as a replacement at 28th circle. It's supposed to provide magic resistance to the Bard and anyone in their party.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Focus - </i></font>32nd Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  Although it's not completely functional yet, when it is this enchante will increase the casting power of all listeners. It is designed to be chanted, and is received at 32nd level.</I><p><font size=+1><B>Naming of Tears - </font>36th Circle</B><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  This chant enhances the defensive abilities of all the listeners, much like the Rage enhances attacks.  It is gained at 36th circle, but there is still some debate about it's overall effectivenes.<p><font size=+1><B><I>Morganae's Song - </i></font>40th Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  At the 40th circle, Bards learn to chant this song.  It increases the concentration power of all listeners.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Aesthene's Bane - </i></font>44th Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  The counterpart to Morganae's Song, Aesthene's Bane is also chanted, but it decreases the concentration of all listener's who aren't in the chanter's party.  It is learned at the 44th circle.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Wings of the Phoenix - </i></font>48th Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>  At the 48th circle, Bards get this as yet undefined enchante for strings and percussion.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Damaris' Lullabye - </i></font>52nd circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>  This peaceful song is designed for stringed instruments only.  When implemented, it will cause listeners not joined to the bard to fall asleep should they fail a contest of wills.  As yet, however, this enchante is not yet functional.  It is learned at the 52nd circle.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Dreamweaver's Charm - </i></font>56th Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  At 56th circle, Bards are granted this chantable song, which will have a chance of charming hostile intelligent creatures.  Unfortunately, it is not yet implemented.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Little Blessings - </i></font>60th Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."> <IMG SRC="icon_recorder.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=49 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><IMG SRC="aninote.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=20 ALT="May be sung."><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  60th circle brings the first of the Blessings songs to the Bards.  Any instrument may be used for this enchante, which, when implemented, will create small, illusionary creatures.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Bigger Blessings - </i></font>64th Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."> <IMG SRC="icon_recorder.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=49 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><IMG SRC="aninote.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=20 ALT="May be sung."><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  At 64th circle, the blessings grow stronger, allowing the bard to create medium-sized illusionary creatures when implemented.  Again, any instrument may be used for this enchante.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Huge Blessings - </i></font>68th Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."> <IMG SRC="icon_recorder.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=49 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><IMG SRC="aninote.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=20 ALT="May be sung."><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  At 68th circle, Bards will gain the last of the blessings, this one capable of creating a really big illusionary creature.  This enchante has yet to be implemented, but it, too, may be played on any instrument.</I><p><font size=+1><B><I>Widow's Wail - </i></font>72nd Circle</B><i><IMG SRC="icon_lute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=40 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><IMG SRC="icon_bodhran.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=26 WIDTH=24 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."> <IMG SRC="icon_recorder.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=49 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><IMG SRC="aninote.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=20 ALT="May be sung."><IMG SRC="icon_flat.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=21 ALT="May be chanted."><br>  At 72nd circle, this enchante is not likely to see use any time in the near future - which is probably just as well, since it, too, is not yet implemented.  When it is, however, it will induce fear in all creatures not joined to the Bard.  If they fail their test of wills, they will flee in terror.  It may be played with any instrument.</I><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><p><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="back2bards_bw.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the Bard's Guild."></A><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " width=25 height=1 border=0><A HREF="drbard.htm"><IMG SRC="back2dr_black.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the Elanthian Bard."></A></BODY></HTML>
