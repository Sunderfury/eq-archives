I think thegreatest example of self control I've ever seen was at Double Wars a fewyears ago. There was a huge stack of wood ten feet high and 50 yards longjust off the fighting fields. When myself, Little Helmut and Mathew foundit while looking for fire wood, we all concluded that it would make a firethat could be seen from the moon. It was hard but we didn't light it up.(But we thought about it). <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="shesbetter.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (She's Much Better than Me)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="ferryride.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (The Best Thing About the Double Wars...)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">60</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
