"Why my dear lass, I am a maker of music, a singer of songs, a teller of tales, and a worker of words.  I sharpen my tongue daily on a stone of silver and forge the dreams that even <b>KINGS</b> dare not keep.  I give the masses what they want and take from them an equal share.  Allow me to emphasize the terms <b>MASSES</b> and <b>EQUAL</b>. Mull over this . . . ponder it.<p>  "When you believe you fully realize the extent of my ability and influence, then hand me your fragile reality and I'll warp it in ways you could never possibly imagine."<p align = right>     - Talthyr Dzsaradin and Ilphryn Galadriel, Master Bards of the Emerald Hills.<p><p><a href="index.html"><IMG SRC="harp4.gif" border=0 alt="Back to the Bard's Guild"><br>Back to the Bard's Guild!</a></body></html>
