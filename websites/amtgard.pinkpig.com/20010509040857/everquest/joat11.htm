The Orcs have been pushed back, the Rangers and Warriors are doing a fine job of keeping the surrounding area well patrolled.  Frankly, I was getting so bored I thought I'd find a new hobby.  I decided that I was going to take up blacksmithing, as it looked to be quite fascinating, if a bit hard.<p>Where was I to start, though?  I asked around a bit, and though most people were rather vague, almost everyone agreed that I needed to start by sharpening weapons, a nice basic technique that would teach me the proper use of a forge at the same time.  Seemed logical enough at the time - but where to get sharpening stones?  I had explored all of Kelethin, and I don't recall ever seeing a stone-salesman.  At least, not sharpening stones.  Another round of questions led me nowhere, and I probably would have been stalled there, had a kind Elven gentleman not overheard me asking.<p>"Steamfont," he said.  He was a High Elf, and a wizard to judge by the robes, and lack of an ever-present pet.<p>"What's that?" I asked.<p>"Not what - where.  It's where you need to go to get your sharpening stones."<p>Having never been out of the Faydark in my entire life, I hadn't a clue where to find this Steamfont place, and I told him as much.  The wizard was kind enough to offer to lead me there.  Turns out, he had to travel there anyway, and was looking for some swift Bardic companionship.  We traded names, and off we went.<p>We ran down the path from Kelethin all the way to Felwithe, which took little enough time in itself, thanks to my drumming, and the fact that I'd been over that path multiple times now, we stopped for a moment while he grabbed some provisions for the trip.  <p>Taking the right fork this time, a road I had not yet explored, we soon found ourselves deep within the Lesser Faydark.  Turns out that the Wizard knew quite a few shortcuts, and it wasn't long before we emerged from the mist-enshrouded forests to the dim pre-dawn twilight of the Steamfont mountains.  It wasn't long before I learned just why they were called that, either.<p>As we walked along, I heard a strange hissing noise, and, fearing some strange giant snake, I called a halt to our travel.  My companion laughed as he pointed out the source, and explained what it was. <p>"These mountains are peppered with roaring fountains of steam, called geysers, that constantly erupt from deep under the earth.  There's a lot of pressure underground, and that pressure has to be released somehow - and this is where.  The Gnomes who inhabit this region have taken advantage of it though, and use the steam to help power their city.  Now c'mon - the windmills are just around this ridge!"<p>I couldn't help but wonder at that comment, "...power their city."  What kind of city needed to be powered?  And what did that mean?  I didn't have long to wonder, however, because just after we came around the ridge I found myself in utter awe of what I was seeing.  The early morning light revealed huge buildings, with giant sails attached to them, slowly turning in the faint breeze.  My traveling partner must have sensed my confusion once more, as he jumped right in to enlighten me.<p>"Oh yeah, the Gnomes are real nuts about harnessing energy wherever they can - they go to great lengths to do it.  Steam, water, wind - I heard that they once even planned to harness the very power of the sun, but that didn't seem to have gone over very well.  Anyway, it's nothing to be afraid of - just go see the Gnome in that windmill over there.  And if you need some help getting home again, just let me know, okay?"<p>I let him know that I'd be fine, and thanked him for all his help.  He waved, and ran off into a nearby valley to continue whatever business he'd been on to begin with.  I decided to check things out for myself.<p>The first windmill I came to turned out to be a sort of hostelry - not really a full-fledged inn, but a safe place to unroll a blanket, at least.  Though how anyone could sleep with that weird rumbling, grinding noise constantly going on, I'll never know.<p>The second windmill had what I'd come looking for.  A kind old Gnome showed me various stones and even some ore he had from the hills nearby.  I thanked him, and purchased what seemed like a fair number of stones - enough to fill up my sack, anyway.  They were small, and looked like they'd wear out pretty quick.  My purchases made, I decided to check out the third windmill before taking a break.<p>The third windmill is apparently the workshop of one Jogl Doobraugh, Master Engineer to the Eldritch Circle, and the best Blackbox Repairman this side of the Abysmal Sea.  At least, that's the way he tells it.  I can't really disbelieve him, either, considering the contraption he affectionately referred to as "Charlotte."  Charlotte resembled nothing so much as a giant spider - if giant spiders had lanterns for eyes, were covered in metal, and made constant 'ticking' noises.  I was impressed by this feat, to recreate nature so nearly-perfectly, but I was even more impressed when Jogl decided to go for a walk, and Charlotte followed right behind, like some loyal puppydog!  Jogl invited me along, and we headed out into the valley.<p>Jogl seemed friendly enough, so I asked him a few questions about the area we were in.  He told me much of the same stuff that my friend the High Elf had, but also added some of the dangers.  It appears that an evil Gnome Necromancer known as Meldrath the Malignant has taken over a nearby mine, enslaving several gnomes through the use of his hideous abominations: Minotaurs.  Having never seen one before, I asked him what they were like.<p>"Huge they are, as large as a Barbarian, and then some - and they have the body of a man - but the head of a bull.  They're fierce, vicious and tough, and just downright not the sort you ask over for tea.  If you're thinking of taking them on, you'd better think again!  I've seen whole parties go in and never come out again.  Yes, indeed.  Those minotaurs are mean business!"<p>I reassured him that I wasn't planning on taking on any two-legged cattle any time soon, and turned the conversation back to the area we were in.  From our vantage point, I could see clear across this valley, and with the sun still a few hours from setting, I could make out creatures almost as though they were standing next to me.  Seeing another metal spider, I commented to Jogl, "Another one of  your fine  creations?"<p>"Goodness no!" Jogl replied.  "Those beastly things are nothing like dear, sweet Charlotte here.  Those things'd just as soon disassemble you as look at you!  They've all gone rogue, been reprogrammed by someone.  Meldrath, I'd suspect.  Mind you, stay away from the rogue clockworks as well - they tend to swarm, and a youngling such as yourself'd find yourself torn apart for sport if you weren't careful!"<p>I smiled, thanked him for his consideration, then pointed out another unfamiliar creature.  Almost bipedal, it loped across the ground much like an ape, and had the head of a dog.  "Kobolds," Jogl said, in answer to my inquiries.  "They're not too mean alone, and the ones that get all the way here are not often interested in a whole lot of fighting, so you're in luck there.  Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time to give Charlotte her weekly oil bath."<p>Noting the sun dropping rapidly in the sky, I decided it wasn't a bad idea for me to make my way back as well.  I stopped at the first windmill again, and asked the owner, Frebin, if I could bed down here for the night.  This area is fascinating.  Maybe tomorrow I'll go hunt down Ak'Anon...<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat10.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat12.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP><p> Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
