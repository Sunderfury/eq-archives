Two good people, Lady Laura and Fat Guy Gerhart are two such people. When they get within 10 feat of each other, somebody gets hurt. One of the more recent cases happened when Laura had "borrowed" Gerhart's sandwich. Gerhart tried to salvaged much as much of his sandwich as he could by eating it from the other side and ended up chewing on Laura's lip instead of the bread. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="hitme.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Hit Me With Your Best Shot)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="imnotmichael.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (I'm Not Michael)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">111</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
