It's not much right now, and I'll spiff it up a bit later - but I wanted a single location for all of my Everquest resources. <p><LI> <A HREF="eqglossary.htm">EQ Glossary</A> - Looking to translate some of those weird abbreviations and phrases you hear every day in EQ?  Look no further.  The Glossary is a compilation (the largest of it's kind on the internet!) of various terms, abbreviations and phrases found in common usage in the Everquest community.  As seen in the Official Guides!<p><LI> <A HREF="eqcommands.htm">EQ Commands</A> - Even more complete than what Verant provides, this commands list shows you every known command that has an actual effect on game play (there are far too many socials to worry about, and they do nothing that a macroed emote can't do, anyway).  <p><LI> <A HREF="eqbard.htm">The EverQuesting Bard</A> - A small Bards website, a bit dated, but still a good read.  As seen in the Official Guides!<p><LI> <A HREF="joat.htm">Journal of a Traveler</A> - Not updated in a very very long time - but it soon will be!  Follow the adventures of Talies, a young bard, as he journies across Norrath!<p><LI> <A HREF="easterquest.htm">EasterQuest</A> - Ever wonder where they got the name for Qeynos?  Why is there a cats face in Befallen?  What other secrets are hidden in EverQuest?  This site tells all!<p><table><TR><TD><a href="http://home.netscape.com/"><img src="../bards/aninet30.gif" align="middle" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=88 alt="View me with Netscape !"></a></TD><TD><center><font size=-1>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq - Master Bard</A><br>With special research assistance by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Talies on Bristlebane</A><br>  And special thanks to <A HREF="http://www.locksley.com/">Ioseph of Locksley</A>, without whose constant inspiration to Bards everywhere, this page never would have been.</font></center></TD><TD><a href = "http://www.hippie98.com/"><img border=0 src="../bards/hiptag98.gif" align="middle" alt="Created with Hippie!" width=105 height=35></a></TD></TR></table><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="celticknotsbar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=22 WIDTH=576 ALT=". . ."></CENTER><p></BODY></HTML>
