These relationships can be as complex as any marriage. And like a marriage, Scadian courtesy dictates that  outsiders do not interfere with what takes place between the two. Both these songs started with the first line of the Chorus. After thinking about that line, I speculated on a how a Squire would react when he discovered he had attached himself to a Knight who turned out to be  a complete jerk, and the advice he might get or the complaints he might make. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="imasquire.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Oh, Oh, Oh, I'm a Squire)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="headshot.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Head Shot)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">89</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
