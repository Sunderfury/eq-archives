During the tourney, the Duke Elffin teased him without mercy.The Budweiser was partly my fault. Myself and Lord Goetz drove together upto the Event. After we had packed the car, we saw that we still had someroom for more beer. I had about 40 Liters of good German Beer, But this wasSweden we were going to. Beer is <I>expensive</I> up there. So Goetz and myselfstopped at a shopette on the way. There selection was pretty poor. So wethought lets get some American beer(BUD). It may be a novelty up there. Sowe stacked six packs every place we could fit in. About another 4 cases.But it didn't go over well. After all the beer in the beer pit wasconsumed, only the Bud remained.     <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="devilscot.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (The Devil Went Down to Scotland)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="batteredhelm.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (The Order of the Old Battered Helm)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">63</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
