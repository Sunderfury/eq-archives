Wood elves poured in from the Lesser and Greater Faydark, High Elven wizards, magicians, clerics and warriors, a few of my own brethren: half-elven bards and scouts.  I've even heard rumours of Gnomes traveling here from the Clockwork City, and Dwarves traveling from far-off Kaladim!  The tide certainly seems to be turning, and just in time, too.<p>With the increased numbers of the dead in the area, the numbers of undead seem to be increasing correspondingly - I've lost count of the skeletons I've shattered.  Last night, I'd nearly shattered my last, though.  As I was laying the finishing blow to one of the hideous monstrosities, a growl warned me just in time for me to throw myself to the ground, and avoid having an axe cleave my head from my shoulders!  It was an orc pawn, and he was growling about how I was responsible for the destruction of his people and his lands. I didn't bother to argue the point, as I was too busy defending myself. I'd never fought an intelligent creature before, and my clumsy attacks were doing nothing but getting me beat up worse.  I started to run, but just as I did so, the pawn knocked me senseless.  As I was shaking my head, trying to see clearly enough to block the next, and surely final, blow, I heard an explosion, and felt a rush of heat against my back.  The orc screamed unintelligably, and then I heard more fighting, and then, suddenly, silence. <p>My vision had cleared enough for me to see what was going on now, and I was helped to my feet by one of Faydark's Champions, who introduced himself as Armoth.  He was accompanied by a High Elven Wizard by the name of Caldayen - that explained the explosion.  I thanked them both, and they both modestly denied it, saying they were just making it a fair fight.  Nevertheless, I was very appreciative, and told them that if they ever needed any help just to let me know, I'd be happy to assist.<p>I was very tired, and my head was throbbing, so I headed back to Kelethin to take a nap in the back of the Guild.  I always seem to feel better after listening to a few songs there.  As I took the first lift up to the platform above, I heard shouting in an unfamiliar accent.  Someone was hawking a blade-sharpening service near the main lift, so, forgetting my injuries temporarily, I hurried down to see what was going on.  There I saw the first Dwarf of my life!  He was short, obviously, but broader than I am, almost like a gnarled stump with arms.  He was strong, too!  I saw him pick up someone twice his size who was complaining about something or other.<p>Well, he was advertising the sharpening of rusty weapons, so I thought, why not?  I introduced myself to him, and learned in turn that his name is Ironshaper.  He offered to sharpen my sword for only 5 silver pieces!  I asked him if he thought there was anything he could do for the old longsword I was still carrying around, and he gave it a critical look, and muttered a few things to himself, but finally he nodded his approval.<p>"It's good strong steel ye've got there, m'lad.  She'll never be as good as new, ye unnerstand, but I can take off the rust, put a bit of an edge on her, you'll see the difference immediately or I'll buy ye another m'self!"<p>Knowing when I'm up against a deal that can't be beat, I handed over my hard-won silver, and followed him to Kelethin's only forge.  He wiped the sword down with a dry cloth, the stuck it into the forge for a few moments.  Pulling it out, he shoved it into a barrel of oil to quench it, then began running a sharpening stone over it.  Rust vanished like magic!  In just a few moments, I had a nearly-new longsword!<p>"The secrets in the oil, m'lad, " Ironshaper nodded sagely, as his eyes twinkled merrily.  I thanked him profusely, and asked if he thought I could ever learn to do that.  "Well, it takes nothing more than determination and practice, m'lad.  Ye've got to want to be a blacksmith more than anything, and practice it every chance ye get - soon ye'll be smithing almost as well as a Dwarf."  He laughed then at some joke I didn't understand, then smiled as he finished, "Take care of her, lad, and she'll take care of you."<p>I told him that I would, and thanking him again, I headed back down to the Songweaver's Guild.  What a day! But it wasn't over yet.  When I got back to the Guild, and told Sylia about the days adventures she smiled cheerfully, and said that it was time for me to begin learning more, and with that, she announced that I was advanced to the third rank!<p>Today has been a good day.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat04.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat06.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
