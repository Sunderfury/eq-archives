They miss thepoint. Been there, Done That, Got the T-shirt, Burned it and Buried it. Ifirst picked up a stick in 1974. At one point, Tennis Elbow forced me tofight right handed instead of left for a few years. It's not that I don'tknow how to use the other forms. I can do them either left or right handed.I just have the most fun fighting Ax and Mace. I'm not trying to "GetAnywhere". I'm quite happy right where I'm at. Thank you.   <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="campwidow.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Camp Widow's Lament)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="rhinowhy.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Rhino, Why don't you Acknowledge My Blows?)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">55</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
