He reminded me of the classic character "Tom Boylin" and the first few verses of it came to mind. I took a lot of poetic license with the later verses to match the theme of this and the original song.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="peershavebrains.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Only the Peers Have the Brains)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="youtaketheredhead.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (You Take the Red Head)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">117</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
