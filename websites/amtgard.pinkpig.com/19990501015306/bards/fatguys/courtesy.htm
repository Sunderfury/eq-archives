At one indoor event,there was only one revel hall. At one end we were having a bardic circle,at the other end all others could talk and socialize. Well theconversations started getting loud, so  one person from the bardic circlestood up and shouted for everyone else to be quite. He sat down and thensaid, &quot;And to think we call ourselves a courteous society.&quot; This song is areminder to the clueless of what courtesy is all about.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="pennsicdream.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Pennsic War Dreaming)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="wetsite.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Wet Site)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">41</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
