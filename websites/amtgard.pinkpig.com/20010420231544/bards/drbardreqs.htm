Primarily, these requirements are in the form of minimums in certain areas of skill, which are listed below.  They are broken up into the three main circle groups: The Young Bard circles, the Experienced Bard circles, and the Master Bard circles.  The requirements are listed in the numbers of ranks needed to gain each Circle.<p><H4><U>Young Bard (Circles 1-10)</U></H4><br><IMG SRC="windmus.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=354 WIDTH=281 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Wind Musicians."><ul><B>Lore: Total of 24 ranks per circle</B><p><li>4 ranks of Stringed<br><li>4 ranks of Vocal<br><li>3.5 ranks of Music Lore<br><li>2.5 ranks of teaching<br><li>2 ranks of scholarship<br><li>1.5 ranks of Mechanical Lore<p></ul><ul><B>Magic: Total of 10 ranks per circle</B><p><li>1.7 ranks of Primary magic<br><li>1.7 ranks of Harness<br><li>1.7 ranks of Power percieve<br><li>?? ranks of Magical Devices (I know there is a requirement, but how much?)<p></ul><ul><B>Survival: No minimum total per circle</B> (but we can assume 3.5)<p><li>0.5 ranks of climbing<br><li>1 rank of skinning<br><li>1 rank of first aid<br><li>1 rank of swimming<p></ul><ul><B>Weapons: 2.5 ranks in each of two weapons</B> (no specific weapon requirements)<p><li>1.5 ranks of parry<br><li>1.5 ranks of evasion<br><li>1.3 ranks of multi-opponent<br><li>1.5 ranks of shield<p></ul><IMG SRC="harper1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=176 WIDTH=176 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="A Celtic Bard."><H4><U>Experienced Bard (11-30)</U></H4><br><ul><B>Lore: 24 total ranks per circle</B><p><li>4 ranks each in 2 instruments (includes vocal)<br><li>1.5 ranks of teaching<p></ul><ul><B>Weapons: 2.5 ranks in each of two weapons</B> (no specific weapon requirements)<p></ul><H4><U>Master Bard (31-50)</U></H4><br><ul><B>Lore: 32 ranks per circle</B><p><B>Weapons: 3.5 ranks in each of two weapons</B> (no specific weapon requirements)<p></ul><H4><U>Above 50th?</U></H4>To the best of my knowledge, the requirements about 50th circle remain the same as those for Master Bard.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><p><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="back2bards_bw.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the Bard's Guild."></A><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " width=25 height=1 border=0><A HREF="drbard.htm"><IMG SRC="back2dr_black.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the Elanthian Bard."></A></BODY></HTML>
