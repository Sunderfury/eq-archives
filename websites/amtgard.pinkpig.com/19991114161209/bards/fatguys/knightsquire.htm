I also met a Squire recently who just came from another kingdom. After watching him fight and how he comported himself off the field, Isurprised he was still a squire. As the story came out, he mentioned thatin his earlier days he was quite a rake, and those earlier years are stillbeing held against him. I took a little poetic license and invented anincident with a queen. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="bloodflows.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Blood Flows Where Lord Sigmundson Goes)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="heard.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (It was the * Heard Round the World)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">45</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
