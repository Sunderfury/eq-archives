This song is in no wayintended to diminish that event. On the overnight ferry back home, a largegroup of us gathered in the nightclub and just had an absolutely grandtime. Normally for me, some of the best times I've had at events are thenight before the events start and you're greeting friends that you may nothave seen for awhile. The close down of an event is usually a sad timefilled with good-byes. This trip was an exception. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="whatsnext.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (What's Next?)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="devilscot.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (The Devil Went Down to Scotland)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">61</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
