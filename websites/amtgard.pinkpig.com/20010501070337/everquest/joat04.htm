Although the most current page will be on the front, later pages are in order.

Everyone was talking about it at the Songweaver's Guild.  Of course, Sylia didn't condone war at all, but she did smile slightly as she admitted that war does make for good epics.<p>In light of the escalating violence, Beleth, one of our song-keepers, took me aside to teach me another valuable fighting song.  This one, he chuckled, would take advantage of my unique singing talents.  I knew he was talking about the way my voice would always crack on the G at the top of my octave, but I took it in good humour.  Calling it "Chords of Dissonance," Breleth showed me how certain notes could be hit in such a way as to make people not only wince, but actually could permanently damage their hearing!  This was not a song to be taken lightly, and he continuously reinforced the importance of not using it around my friends, but only in the case of emergencies, where I might otherwise not survive.  I assured him that I would be very careful, and Breleth promised to teach me how to use it with the lute someday.<p>As I stepped towards the lift, I overheard two rangers talking about the war.  Apparently, their guild had instituted a bounty, paying rangers for proof of kills!  As they excitedly discussed their plans for earning the bounty, I started to wonder if maybe this war wasn't going to claim a higher toll than we had imagined.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><B>February 27th, 3172</B><p>It's horrible, absolutely horrible.  I can't even begin to describe the devastation - bodies are everywhere, orc and elf alike.  High Elven clerics have traveled all the way from Felwithe, just to be put to work non-stop healing the living, and saying prayers for the dead.  Bardic messengers have been sent out requesting reinforcements from outlying villages and huts.  The city guards are being kept busy holding off wave after wave of orc attacks, and the bodies of the fallen litter the forest floor like autumn leaves.<p>With the stench of death hanging heavy over the Faydark, the scavengers have taken advantage of the reduced number of hunters and guards, and begun coming closer to the city.  I myself had to kill no fewer than 8 wolves, the last just to keep it from dragging a corpse off from the burial pyre!  The clerics are probably just as tired of seeing my face as everyone elses, but someone has to protect us!  I just hope we get reinforcements soon, or we won't survive.<CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat03.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat05.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
