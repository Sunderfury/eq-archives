All Spellsongs may be sung, but some may be enhanced by playing the appropriate instrument.  Those songs are marked with the following symbols:<p><IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."> - May be played on percussion instruments.<br><IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."> - May be played on stringed instruments.<br><IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."> - May be played on wind instruments<br><IMG SRC="icon_eqtrumpet.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on brass instruments."> - May be played on brass instruments<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><p><font size=+1><B>Chant of Battle - </font>1st level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>This is the first, and for a long time, the most valuable Spellsong a Bard can learn.  Available at every guild, this song enhances not only the Bard, but also any who may be grouped with him by lending strength to the listeners, as well as enhancing their dexterity, thus making them more difficult to hit.<p><font size=+1><B>Chords of Dissonance - </font>2nd level</B><IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."> <br>When a Bard first picks up a stringed instrument, or when he is first learning to sing, the first few dozen notes are often likely to make one wince and cringe.  This can be turned to the Bard's advantage, and in fact, this Spellsong is all about capitalizing on mis-plucked chords and screeching high notes, causing damage to all within earshot.  Though it doesn't cause much damage, this can often be the lifesaver for a young bard just learning to defend herself.  Be careful, though, as anyone affected by it will likely become quite agitated - this has led to the premature ending of many a young Bard's promising careers.   It is found in every Bard's Guild, usually to the dismay of the instructors.<p><font size=+1><B>Jaxon's Jig o' Vigor - </font>3rd Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>  At third level, Bards may begin to learn certain restorative patterns in music.  The first of these, a Jig, can actually help refresh and restore lost stamina from over-exertion.  Always pleasant after a long day in the fields, the Jig o' Vigor is a farmer's favourite, and affects all members of the Bard's party.  All of the Guilds are happy to teach you this upbeat rhythm.<p><font size=+1><B>Lyssa's Locating Lyric - </font>4th Level</B><br>A very odd melody, this song pervades the mind and allows the Bard to sense the direction of lost items.  Simply by focusing on the target, the Bard begins to feel pulled in the direction of anything related to the target, allowing the Bard to reunite people with their lost items.  When left to it's own devices, the song will simply seek out the nearest corpse, wherever it may be.  This is such a popular song, all of the guild's carry it.<p><font size=+1><B>Selo's Accelerando - </font>5th Level</B><IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>It's a well known fact that a good song can make a dull trip pass quickly.  This song is no exception - in fact, enhanced by bardic magic, the road seems to practically fly under your feet!  Everyone in the Bard's party can take advantage of this effect, but it's important to be careful when running over hills and valleys, as the speed at which you travel can often cause you to fly right over the edge of a cliff without realizing it.  Because of the distance between guilds, all of the guilds carry this song, allowing Bards to be wonderful messengers. <p><font size=+1><B>Hymn of Restoration - </font>6th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>  The other major restorative song and carried by all the guilds, this soothing hymn actually helps speed the process of healing - a major boon when there are no healers available.  This will likely be the most often requested service of a Bard, after the Locating song, and makes the Bard a very valuable member of any party.<p><font size=+1><B>Jonthan's Whistling Warsong - </font>7th Level</B><br>Only really effective for the Bard herself, this ancient warsong strengthens and speeds up the Bard, making her a more effective combatant, especially useful when the Bard is alone.  All of the Bards' Guilds teach this song because of the value in self-defense.<p><font size=+1><B>Kelin's Lugubrious Lament - </font>8th Level</B><IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>  Only found in Kelethin, the sadness of this melody works on a single individual, lulling them and hopefully preventing them from attacking.  Other individuals around the saddened one may still attack, so it is not a sure fire safe passage, and naturally, some beings seem to be completely resistant to the effects.  <p><font size=+1><B>Elemental Rhythms - </font>9th Level</B><IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>This fascinating rhythm was written especially to help protect a Bard from the elements - Fire and Cold, especially.  Not only does it work on the Bard's entire party, but it also seems to protect from certain fire and cold-based attacks.  It is only found in Qeynos and Kelethin.<p><font size=+1><B>Magical Monologue - </font>9th Level</B><br>With the discovery of the moon of Luclin, came new music, and this was the first new song to be discovered.  Singing this enchanting tune weaves magic into the weapon wielded by the Bard, allowing her to attack creatures that can only be struck by magic.  It can be found in Katta Castellum - arguably more difficult to get than a magical weapon, but potentially useful nonetheless.<p><font size=+1><B>Anthem de Arms - </font>10th Level</B><br>Found in both Qeynos and Freeport, this powerful song is designed for combat.  All of the members of a Bard's party are given enhanced strength and speed in battle, allowing them to swing faster and more powerfully.  A very useful song for the Battle Bard.<p><font size=+1><B>Cindra's Charismatic Carillion - </font>11th Level</B><IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><br>  In Kelethin you can learn this fascinating song which entrances people to such a degree that they will like you more.  Though it will occasionally allow a Bard greater discounts on items, it is more useful in allowing one to communicate with or pass by hostile beings.  Not all creatures are affected by this.<p><font size=+1><B>Brusco's Boastful Bellow - </font>12th Level</B><br>Both the Freeport and the Qeynos guilds will happily train a Bard in the proper contraction of the diaphragm necessary to create the powerful tone this song uses.  Although it doesn't do a lot of damage, it's focused nature is really great for getting the attention of creatures some distance off.  It is important to remember that not every creature will be harmed by it, but most will be annoyed, so use this Bellow with caution.<p><font size=+1><B>Purifying Rhythms - </font>13th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>The sequel to Elemental Rhythms, this song is meant to help protect the Bard and his party from the vagaries of rampant diseases, harmful toxins and poisons, and even from some kinds of magic!  Like it's predecessor, it's found in both Kelethin and Qeynos.<p><font size=+1><B>Lyssa's Cataloging Libretto - </font>14th Level</B><br>Lyssa's second song is also an informational one - but this one focuses on a single item, allowing the singer to determine qualities otherwise hidden to him.  This one is only found in Erudin, making it somewhat rare and hard to acquire for the average Bard.<p><font size=+1><B>Kelin's Lucid Lullaby - </font>15th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>A more powerful version of the Lugubrious Lament, this Lullaby soothes multiple creatures, and can actually cause them to fall asleep!  This can be very handy if you're surrounded and need to make a hasty getaway, but apparently, only lasts as long as you are singing it - so don't try switching songs.  The sleepy critters REALLY hate that.  Following in the theme, it can only be found in Kelethin. <p><font size=+1><B>Song of Sustenance - </font>15th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>Found only in Katta Castellum, this magical melody can soothe the most savage beast of all: hunger.  Able to affect your entire party, it will alleviate even the strongest of hunger pains for a brief period of time.<p><font size=+1><B>Tarew's Aquatic Ayre - </font>16th Level</B><IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><br>A truly unique melody, this one can actually be sung underwater!  Not only that, but as long as the Bard continues to play, his entire party may safely stay beneath the surface, allowing them to get to places otherwise denied to them.  Found only in Highpass Hold, this is a very rare, and valuable, song.<p><font size=+1><B>Guardian Rhythms - </font>17th Level</B><IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>The third in the protection series of beats, Guardian Rhythms helps protect the Bard and his party from magic as well as physical attacks.  Both Kelthin and Qeynos hold this song.<p><font size=+1><B>Denon's Disruptive Discord - </font>18th Level</B><IMG SRC="icon_eqtrumpet.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on brass instruments."><br>  Some things only get better with time; fortunately this song just got worse.  Building on the horrible cacophony from Chord's of Dissonance, this spellsong takes it several steps further, and includes the power of the brass instrument, as well.  Causing near-continuous damage to all listeners, this song is not a good choice for parties and celebrations.  Available in Freeport and Qeynos, and wherever deaf musicians may be found. <p><font size=+1><B>Shuari's Sonorous Clouding - </font>19th Level</B><IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><br>An incredibly amazing song, the lilting notes and trilling melody actually distract listeners to the point where they don't even notice the Bard and her party.  Found only in Erudin, it's rare but the value is certainly worth the trip. <I>note that this spell may not be singable - only usable with wind instruments</I><p><font size=+1><B>Largo's Melodic Binding - </font>20th Level</B><br>A strangely riveting song, this tune actually seems to affect the nervous center of the listeners brain, paralyzing the body, and slowing the affected creature down.  Not entirely effective, due to the varying nature of different creature's brains, this spell can nonetheless be helpful in 'softening up' a difficult creature.  It can be learned both in Qeynos and Freeport.<p><font size=+1><B>Cassindra's Chant of Clarity - </font>20th Level</B><br>An eerie yet strangely focusing chant, this melody is beloved of casters everywhere.  It seems to clear their minds, refreshing their powers.  Rushka Delamoor can be found selling this song in the tunnel in East Commons.<p><font size=+1><B>Melanie`s Mellifluous Motion - </font>21st Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><br>What a wondrous song! This song is said to actually take the Bard on a short random teleport! Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to take his party with him. It is found in Highpass Hold, making it an exceedingly rare song indeed.<p><font size=+1><B>Alenia`s Disenchanting Melody - </font>22nd Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>This amazing melody will actually disrupt certain magical effects on the party, removing hazardous spell effects.  Found in both Kelethin and Qeynos, it is not known how effective it is, or whether it removes beneficial effects as well.<p><font size=+1><B>Selo's Consonant Chain - </font>23rd Level</B><br>Almost the reverse of Selo's Accelerando, this song slows down the target's movement and attack speed, and is even rumoured to be able to completely halt a creature in place!  Another of the few songs available only in High Hold Pass, it is not known what instrument this may be played on.<p><I><B>The remaining songs are only barely known about:</B></I><p><font size=+1><B>Lyssa's Veracious Concord - </font>24th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><br> Found only in Erudin, it is said that this song will allow you to see things as you have never seen them before.<p><font size=+1><B>Psalm of Warmth - </font>25th Level</B><br>This Psalm is sung, and found in Erudin, Kelethin and Qeynos.  I would suspect that it provides protection from cold-based attacks.<p>   <font size=+1><B>Angstlich's Apalling Screech - </font>26th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqtrumpet.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on brass instruments."> <br>This song is said to be so horrible, so terrible, that none may listen without trying to escape it's frightful sounds.  It was once said to be played on something called "bagpipes", and may be purchased in Kelethin.<p><font size=+1><B>Solon's Song of the Sirens - </font>27th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><br>This sounds like a charm song, perhaps to control other creatures.  It is played on wind instruments, and may be found in the back room in Kelethin.<p><font size=+1><B>Crission's Pixie Chase - </font>28th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><br>Another wind instrument song, this one distracts a monster with visions of pixies.  You can also find this in Kelethin.<p><font size=+1><B>Psalm of Vitality - </font>29th Level</B><br>This would seem to protect the Bard's party from diseases and may be found in Kelethin and Qeynos.  It is sung.<p><font size=+1><B>Fufil's Curtailing Chant - </font>30th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>This powerful rhythms of this song are said to disrupt magical resistance and even cause injury if listened to for too long.  You can find it in Freeport and  Qeynos - if you dare...<p><font size=+1><B>Amplification - </font>30th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>Recently discovered in Katta Castellum, it is rumoured that this song will amplify the effects of songs that are normally only sung, providing the same bonus as though they were being played with an instrument.<p><font size=+1><B>Agilmente's Aria of Eagles - </font>31st Level</B><br>It is rumoured that with the power of this song, you can actually fly!  Only High Hold Pass holds the secret to this song.<p><font size=+1><B>Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity - </font>32nd Level</B><br>No instruments are used with this song, but it is rumoured that this might be the long sought-after spellsong to assist spellcasters recover their mana faster!  Kelethin and Qeynos both have this available.<p>                 <font size=+1><B>Psalm of Cooling - </font>33rd Level</B><br>Found in Erudin, Kelethin and Qeynos, this would appear to provide protection from fire-based attacks. <p>       <font size=+1><B>Lyssa's Solidarity of Vision - </font>34th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><br>This mysterious presentation from Lyssa's scrolls is said to allow you to see through another's eyes! Try Erudin if you want to learn this one.<p>       <font size=+1><B>Cantata of Soothing - </font>34th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>Said to be more powerful than Cassindra's previous offerings, this song may even combine the Hymn of Restoration with the Jig of Vigor and the Chorus of Clarity!<p>             <font size=+1><B>Denon's Dissension - </font>35th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqtrumpet.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on brass instruments."><br>Rumour has it that this song will actually cause creatures that would normally be allied to begin to attack one another.  Another rumour claims that it, instead, drains the target's mana.  Both Freeport and Qeynos have this available.<p>   <font size=+1><B>Vilia's Verses of Celerity - </font>36th Level</B><br>This song is said to improve agility for the entire party and is found in both Freeport and Qeynos.<p>   <font size=+1><B>Psalm of Purity - </font>37th Level</B><br>It is believed that this Psalm, which is sung without the benefit of musical instruments, will purge the body of all listeners of even the most toxic of poisons, while protecting them at the same time.  It is found in both Kelethin and Qeynos.<p>   <font size=+1><B>Tuyen's Chant of Flame - </font>38th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>Tuyen studied Fufil's complex rhythms, and expounded upon them, studying variations on the theme.  This one is said to reduce resistance to fire-based attacks, while still retaining the damage aspect of Fufil's Curtailing Chant. Both Freeport and Qeynos hold the secret to this music.<p><font size=+1><B>Solon's Bewitching Bravura - </font>39th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqflute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on wind instruments."><br>This must surely be an upgrade to the Song of the Sirens.  Like its predecessor, it is sold in Kelethin and played on wind instruments.<p>   <font size=+1><B>Katta's Song of Sword Dancing - </font>39th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>A new discovery in Katta Castellum, 'tis said that those who dance to this tune will strike true, while those who dance against it will stumble.<p>           <font size=+1><B>Syvelian's Anti-Magic Aura - </font>40th Level</B><br>This spellsong can only be sung, but it is said that it will remove magical effects.  This could be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the circumstances.  It is found only in Kelethin.<p>   <font size=+1><B>Psalm of Mystic Shielding - </font>41st Level</B><br>Another of the Psalms of protection, this one is rumoured to protect a Bard's party from magical influences.  It is found in both Kelethin and Qeynos.<p>   <font size=+1><B>McVaxius Berserker Crescendo - </font>42nd Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqtrumpet.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on brass instruments."> <br>It is suspected that this song increases the combat abilities for a Bard's party, making them stronger and faster, and even protecting them to some extent.  It can be found in both Freeport and Qeynos.<p><font size=+1><B>Denon's Desperate Dirge - </font>43th Level</B><br>Denon's research into damaging melodies led him to this last-shot effort.  Said to affect up to four opponents simultaneously, the Dirge is rumoured to be a most powerful song.  Be careful with this one, however, for it can only be used once every few hours.  It should be found in both Qeynos and Freeport.<p><font size=+1><B>Cassindra's Elegy - </font>44th Level</B><br>The mystics of Erudin are particularly close-mouthed about this song they harbour in their library, but it is suspected that it will actually increase one's ability to learn and utilize information, giving benefits to both intelligence and wisdom!  Seek out the one in Erudin if you wish to learn it.<p><font size=+1><B>Jonathan's Provocation - </font>45th Level</B><br>Though found both in Qeynos and Freeport, not much is known about this song, but it's suspected to be an upgrade to the Whistling Warsong, which would speed the Bard and enhance his strength.<p>     <font size=+1><B>Tuyen's Chant of Frost - </font>46th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqdrum.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on percussion instruments."><br>Like his previous creation, Tuyen was studying variations on the theme started with Fufil's Curtailing chant.  In addition to damaging listeners, this song is rumoured to increase a creature's vulnerability to cold-based attacks.  Like it's predecessor, this song is found in Freeport and Qeynos.<p><font size=+1><B>Niv's Melody of Preservation - </font>47th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>Kelethin and Qeynos both hide the secrets of this mysterious tune of protection against magical attacks.  'Tis rumoured to also increase the combat abilities of the Bard's party, and even help them heal faster!<p><font size=+1><B>Selo's Chords of Cessation - </font>48th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>Selo's final work, and considered a masterpiece by all, the Chords of Cessation  is a double melody, inspired by both the Chords of Dissonance, and Largo's slow, yet hypnotic, Melodic Binding.  This powerful song is closely guarded in Highpass Keep.<p><font size=+1><B>Shield of Songs - </font>49th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqlute.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="May be played on stringed instruments."><br>This song, found in Erudin, is rumoured to protect the Bard and their party from damage, absorbing blows both physical and magical.<p>   <font size=+1><B>Melody of Ervaj - </font>50th Level</B> <IMG SRC="icon_eqtrumpet.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=47 ALT="Must be played on brass instruments."> <br>An amazing battle song, this is said to speed the party and protect them from damage.  Rumour has it that it comes from giant white worms on the continent of Velious. <p>   <font size=+1><B>Verses of Victory - </font>50th Level</B> <br>Another incredible group battle song, this one increases nearly all of the combat attributes for the Bard's entire party.  It can be purchased in Qeynos and Freeport.<p>Songs above 50th level are barely but rumours, and little is known at this point.<p>                   <CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 alt=" "></CENTER><!--Thank you everyone....--><table><TR><TD><a href="http://www.anybrowser.org/"><img src="../bards/anydamn2.gif" align="middle" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=88 alt="View me with Any Damned Browser!"></a></TD><TD><center>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq - Master Bard</A><br>With special research assistance by Talies on Bristlebane<br>  And special thanks to <A HREF="http://www.locksley.com/">Ioseph of Locksley</A>, without whose constant inspiration to Bards everywhere, this page never would have been.</center></TD><TD><a href = "http://www.hippie98.com/"><img border=0 src="../bards/hiptag98.gif" align="middle" alt="Created with Hippie!" width=105 height=35></a></TD></TR></table><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><p><A HREF="../bards/index.html"><IMG SRC="../bards/back2bards_bw.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the Bard's Guild."></A><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " width=25 height=1 border=0><A HREF="eqbard.htm"><IMG SRC="../bards/back2eq_green.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the EverQuesting Bard."></A><p align=right>   Last modified on Wed May 03 09:58:16 2000     </BODY></HTML>
