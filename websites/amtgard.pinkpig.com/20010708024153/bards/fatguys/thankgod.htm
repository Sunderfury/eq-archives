In these days of Political Correctness, if you compliment a lady on her appearance, you can get slapped with a harassment suit. In the SCA, you can treat a lady like a Lady without that fear. Some have raised flirting to a high art, again in a safe environment. Most Lords in the SCA  know how to behave around a Lady. As for the rest of the song, I just tried to capture some of the fun and spirit of the SCA. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="sedition.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Sedition)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="redbelt.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Red Belt, White Belt)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">101</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
