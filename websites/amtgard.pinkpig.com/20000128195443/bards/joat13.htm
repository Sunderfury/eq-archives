Since lunch, I think I've managed to explore every single nook and cranny of this incredible city.  The job Manik had me working on turned into quite a lot more than I had expected!<p>It seems that, while there are hundreds of clockworks in the city, Manik only needed the boxes from a specific few.  I wandered all the way from the wall, through King Ak'Anon's palace (nice man, if a bit.. odd looking for a gnome...) and deeper into the depths of Ak'Anon than I thought I would ever need to go, trying to find all of these clockworks.<p>At one point, I found myself deep within the Pillar of Commerce, a large pyramid-shaped structure in the primary "commercial" district.  Inside the building, there were shops, merchants, a bank - even a zoo!  I spent some time staring at their modest collection of animals before returning to the task at hand.  I must say, having now seen a minotaur, they're every bit as ugly as I'd feared.<p>I discovered that the waters in Ak'Anon, though strangely coloured, are quite safe to drink from or even swim in.  It seems that quite a few Gnomes do a rather brisk business in the fishing trade here, pulling pale, sightless fish from the depths of darkened lakes.  It's a good thing I'd learned the basics of swimming, too, as there were a few places inaccessible except by swimming.  Or perhaps the Gnomes have some other mysterious invention I haven't explored yet?<p>In any case, having finally collected all of the requested blackboxes, I returned them to Manik.  He muttered over them for a moment, checking the numbers against his own checklist, then grunted his satisfaction.  He tossed me a few coins, then, and said, "Not bad.  If you still need something to do, I could use a courier real quick.  I heard Bards are the fastest travelers in Norrath, except maybe Wizards..."  I quickly agreed, and he pulled another blackbox out of a stack.  "This one has been damaged, and I need it repaired by the finest Engineer in Steamfont-"<p>"Jogl Doobraugh, Master Engineer with the Eldritch Collective," I interrupted, pleased with my own knowledge.  Manik's glare told me he'd rather I kept my mouth shut, so I did.<p>"Well, since you already seem to know him, I'll trust you know where to find him.  Take this to him immediately.  He'll see to your compensation."  With that, he turned back to cataloguing the boxes I had just brought in, so I took that as my cue to leave.<p>Being a Bard is truly a great blessing, especially for one who likes to travel as much as I do.  When I emerged from the clockwork city, I realized that I'd spent nearly the entire day running around in the bowels of the earth.  A light rain had begun to fall, obscuring the sunset, but I could tell that full darkness was not far off.  Not wanting to be running around these lands at night, I pulled out my drum, and started the rhythmic beat of my traveling song.  Before I knew it, I was at the windmills, talking to Jogl.<p>"Ahh hmm... yes... Here's the problem." Jogl was quick to fix the box, and when he did so, it spit out a long strip of parchment, covered in the cramped script I could only assume was Gnomish.  "Yes - see, the report log was all jammed up in there.  They'll be wanting that, I'm sure."  Jogl looked up then, as though surprised that I was still standing around.  "You're still here?  Good - do me a favour, run this back to Ak'Anon, would you?  Drekon Vebnebber, the chief cataloguer for the Gemchoppers will be wanting this report.  Oh... and here's a few coins for your trouble."<p>Jogl pressed a few silvers into my hand then pushed me out the door.  It was past dark, so I was a bit worried, but I went ahead and ran back to the City of Gnomes, figuring that I'd be safe once I got there.  Drekon had already gone home for the night, so I found a nice unoccupied corner, and caught up on my notes.  I wonder what wonders tomorrow will bring.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat12.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat14.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP><p> Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
