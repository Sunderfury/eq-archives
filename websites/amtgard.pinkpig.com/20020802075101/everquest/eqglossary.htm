EverQuest is no exception, and as I have journeyed the lands of Norrath, I have discovered many new words and phrases that I have found to be somewhat unusual, and confusing to those new to these lands.<p>To help such new travelers out, I am compiling this glossary.  I cannot say that it is complete, nor is it the final say on the definition of any particular term. In fact, I expect as the world of Norrath continues to grow and evolve that many of these terms will become extinct while other, new ones, come to take their place.  If you have any corrections to make or any new terms or phrases you'd like to see added, please contact <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Talies the Wanderer</A>.<p><IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=26 ALT="NEW!!!">Now, you can visit all the new terms on a page of their own.
