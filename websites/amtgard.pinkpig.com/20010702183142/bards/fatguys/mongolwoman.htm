They are collection of Mongol personas filled with irreverence and lots of fun. There have been many, many SCA urban legends concerning this group. One of my favorites is the Squire who went to their camp and offered to service all their woman. They gave him to the women of the camp who promptly Duct-Taped him naked to a tree and left him there. This is a song for some would be Romeos.  <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="livelarge.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (All Fat Guys Like to Live Large)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="waronceagain.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (I'm in a War Once Again)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">108</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
