After years of fighting, you occasionally come across an opponent who you just can’t win against. I am not talking about fighting super dukes other masters, but someone who fights at about the same level as you. People you win against, win against him all the time, but you two face off, he (or she) is always the victor. The song is written from that perspective. Part of it must be in the mind. I am a firm believer, that if you do not walk onto the field and say to yourself “I Own It”, you have lost before the first blow is struck.   <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="butter.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Butter Goes on the Holey Side)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="3mavens.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (3 Authenticity Mavens)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">93</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
