At the Double Warsin Sweden in 1994, myself and several other Americans working in Germanyattended. Now if you have ever had a run in with the authenticity police,imagine an event with over 200 APs running around for a whole week. TheSwedes play with gusto. Their encampments are the most period that I haveseen anywhere. If you don't have a period tent, you have to set up inanother area. Most of the Swedes had never seen or encountered the SCAAmerican style. Many thought that they had invented it. But the mainelement that we noticed was that they were taking the game and themselvesMUCH TOO SERIOUSLY. <br><img src="tab.gif" alt=" ">Interject into this environment five middle-aged Americans, getting wide around the middle who had been playing the game forever. (I started playingback in 1974). We interjected some comic relief into the event. They didn'tquite know what to think about us when we set up our plastic tents andColeman stove. They did notice that we were having too much fun and as theweek went by more and more of the folks were coming to our encampment. <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">About halfway through the event, they had a four man melee tournament.Each team had to come up with a name. As you can imagine, most of theSwedes took these serious, macho sounding, manly names, like the Red Death,or the Sharks. Well when asked what our name would be we chose "Four FatGuys". On the bridge battles we devastated them. We came in second in thetourney. During the wars, if they needed a shield wall broken the cry was"Send in the Fat Guys!"  The name stuck. For the rest of the event we wereknown as the "Fat Guys." By the end of the event we had come up thedefinition of living large. That's how it started. The only official statuswe have is the right to impose a beer tax at all feasts in the kingdom aslong as we insure that the King will never go dry. We also host a "Beer PitTourney" at the Double Wars. Each entrant has to bring a beer to enter,Squires must bring two,  and Knights, a six-pack. The winner of the tourney gets all thebeer. We are known to ask the King quite publicly "Is this going to be aone, two, ... or six beer court?" <p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">For more on the Fat Guys, visit <A HREF="http://www.on-net.net/~ralphb/fatguy.htm">The Fatguys Homepage</A>!</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" width=90><center><a href="index.html"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Back." border=0><br>Back to the Table of Contents</a></center><br><img src="tab.gif" height=1 width=90 alt=" "></td><td><img src="tab.gif" height=1 width=15 alt=" "></TD><td></table></font></body></html>
