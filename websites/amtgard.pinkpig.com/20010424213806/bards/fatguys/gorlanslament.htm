I was plagued by other folks who wanted them also. I would bring it to most events I attended, and set it up for use a smokers and party tent for late at night, when others have to the crash space. The tent became known as the Fat Tent.  I had so many request for tents, that I made a Tent Run to UAE and brought back ten tents for the other Fat Guys. After that, I made several attempts to import more of them and set it up as a home business for me and my wife. I have been almost overcome with delay, non-delivery etc. But someday (hopefully a few weeks from this writing) I'll manage to get a shipment in. All the things described have been seen in one or another Fat Guys Tent, and last year at double wars we were able to watch other tents go flying by.  <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="obesegrace.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Gorlan's Lament)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="somebeer.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (There's Some Beer)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">73</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
