I always try to encourage any honest effort by somebody at garb or any other Art or Science. But in any large group, you get a pecking order. Some folks seem to feel that to advance, they must cut others down, and seem to show delight in showing how much better or knowledgeable they are than others. There is nothing wrong with constructive criticism, but some of these comments can be extremely cruel and mean spirited. They discourage participation in the Arts and Sciences. I see these mavens as destructive and the exact opposite of what the dream is about.  I have seen new members reduced to tears by these vultures. Fortunately, these folks spend most of their time preying on each other, and very rarely get invited to others camps. Anyway, this song is an attempt to view them from a humorous angle.      <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="killhim.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (I Don't Know How to Kill Him)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="seneschalblues.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (The SCA Seneschal Blues)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">94</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
