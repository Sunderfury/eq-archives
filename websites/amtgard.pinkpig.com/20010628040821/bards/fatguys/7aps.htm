I put it there specifically to warn A.P. types that this is not a camp for like minds. For the last few years, the Fat Guys Camp (from a distance), has been one of the most period looking camps at most sites, mainly because of the tents. This confuses most A.P’s because we normally will set up in the non-period  encampment. This song is about some of the various reactions I have observed.<p><I>(ed. note: A.P. stands for &quot;Authenticity Police&quot; and refers to those people who run around repressing anything remotely anachronistic - such as beer cans, charcoal grills and of course, pink flamingoes.)</I><p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="2rattan.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Give me Two Rattan Broadswords)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="hatchasers.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Hat Chasers)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">83</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
