In my humble opinion it iscourtesty. With the SCA in Europe there are many cultural differences. Insome countries, the ladies feel a strong need to assert their independance.The only lords in those countries that escort their ladies are those thathave had exposure to the SCA in the USA. I have,  many a time,  been chewedout by ladies for offering to help carry a load, offer a seat, or an escortwhen a lady is called before the crown. This song started as subtlereminder to both lords and laidies of the basic actions of courtesy in theSCA. My first title was going to be &quot;Clues for the Clueless&quot;. It kind ofdeviated from the original goal, but I liked the end result anyway.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="codpiece.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (The Codpiece)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="thumper.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Thumper)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">8</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
