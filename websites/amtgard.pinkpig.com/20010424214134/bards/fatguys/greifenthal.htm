At the Quest of Griffins Hoard, theyhad a Bardic competition that had to, in some way, be about griffins. This was primarily an Archery Event. Only two others had brought armor andone of them had to leave early to drive a sick lady home. So I had some time on my hands. Since I was day tripping, I couldn't drink.I decided to write a ballad about the event. Seeing that 70% of the folks there were archers, I made it an archer'ssong. One of the few songs I've completed on site, It took about two hours.<p>It worked and I won the competition.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="listengossip.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Listen to the Gossip of the Courtiers)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="shesbetter.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (She's Much Better Than Me)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">58</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
