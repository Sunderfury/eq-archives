The song &quot;Give Me Two Pina Coladas&quot; <I>(ed. note - that's "Two Pina Coladas", sung by Garth Brooks)</I> was on the radio a lot last year. It started with the chorus, substituting Rattan Broadswords for Pina coladas and Earl Morgan instead of Captain Morgan. The rest of was just extrapolation from that start. I have known many two stick junkies, and am myself a Florentine Maul Weapon junkie (I like fighting with axe and mace).  <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="marshalsstaff.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (The Marshal's Staff)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="7aps.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Seven A.P.s)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">82</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
