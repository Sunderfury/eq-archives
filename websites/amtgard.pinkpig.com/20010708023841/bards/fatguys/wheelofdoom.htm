This was a wheel of fortune-like device that would land on one of several Boffer weapons. He had created a Giant Drum Stick, a Q-Tip, A Giant Flower, A Giant Lollypop, Two Flattened Raccoons (Florentine Road Kill), and an Electric Guitar (Hammer of the Gods, given by a Page named Jimmy). He had a sick mind. But it was a fun Boffer tourney. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="youtaketheredhead.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (You Take the Red Head)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="rhinosdefense.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Rhino's Defense)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">119</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
