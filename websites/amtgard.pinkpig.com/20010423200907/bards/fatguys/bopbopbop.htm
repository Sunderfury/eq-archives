That is one of the main reasons that Bear Pits are popular. You can get your fill of fighting. Sir Axels last event before he departed for the USA, was Cold Steel. The winter Version of Bop till you Drop. It is held in Winter, when there is still snow on the ground. The tradition has continued. For the last two years, it has been hosted by Martin the Mercenary, A Fat Guy. After the Fighting was over, he held a feast at his house, and there were many call for &quot;Bring out the Dancing Girls.&quot; Martin always a gracious host, dressed a few ladies in Fat Guys Tabards and Convinced them to Dance. A good time was had by all. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="littledog.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Oh Where Oh Where has my Little Dog Gone?)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="house.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (House of the Fatguys)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">78</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
