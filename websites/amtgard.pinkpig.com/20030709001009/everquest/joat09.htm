Prices seem a bit higher here than in Kelethin, and people are a bit less friendly, but it's still a nice enough town.  I went back to the lake to see if that old Gnome was there again, but I didn't see him.  Of course, that doesn't mean much, considering his skills, but I wasn't going to go look foolish talking to every lamp and bush.<p>I decided instead to try something I had seen a few people around the lake doing: fishing.  I had heard it was fun, and the benefit, catching your own food!  The pole was rather expensive, but at least bait only ran 4 copper each. I spent the next several hours getting rather frustrated, catching nothing but an old sandal and some soggy fish scales.  Finally, my patience was rewarded by a firm tug on the line, and a splash as the fish I had hooked tried to jump away.  I kept a firm grip on it, and then, like I had seen other people do, I slowly walked the fish back in to the shore, pulling the line in only after I had it in the shallows.  After what seemed like hours, but was in reality only a couple of minutes, I pulled out my very own fresh-caught fish!  I was so excited, I nearly dropped it back into the lake, but I recovered it just in time.  Slippery buggers!<p>After all that sun and hard work, I discovered that I was somewhat hot and sweaty.  Seeing how much fun everyone else seemed to be having in the water, I decided to join them.  Leaving my pole and gear on the shore, I slowly stepped into the shallows, letting the cool water soak my feet.  Let me tell you - there's nothing like the feeling of cool water on sun-soaked skin.  Seeing how everyone else was just diving in with their clothes on, I figured that a little water wouldn't hurt mine, either, so I stepped in further, until finally I was standing with my head just barely above water.  I had to keep waving my hands back and forth to keep my balance, and a few waves from across the lake threatened to push me over, but it was refreshing and exciting at the same time, so I enjoyed myself.<p>I noticed the sun beginning to dip once more, so I waded out, wrung myself out as best I could, then decided that I would dry on my way back to Kelethin.  It was really time for me to check in with Sylia.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat08.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat10.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
