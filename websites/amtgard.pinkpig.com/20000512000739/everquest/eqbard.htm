Able to fight, heal, or do any of a number of useful tasks, the Bard is probably the single-most useful class all around in EverQuest - but only if he's used in a group.  The Bard is not meant to be a loner.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">Although the Bard can be a quite talented fighter, he never quite achieves the combat skills found in the so-called tanks of the lands: Warriors, Paladins, Rangers, and others.  He also never gets the number or power of damaging spells that the spellcasters get,  thus, his role in combat is second-string at best.  However, in a group, a single Bard can mean the difference between defeating that monster, and having to come collect your corpses later.  Many Bardic songs are designed to affect the entire party, and some of these are certainly potent enough to make a significant impact on combat, whether it be healing the nearly-dead, or chanting a rousing war-song to infuse their blood with vigour.  <p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">The Bard is also given a great variety of skills to help him survive, compounding his usefulness to a party.  It is often said that trips made with a Bard never seem to last quite as long, combats seem to go better, and quests are easier to solve.  It is not difficult to see why the Bard is such a valued and entertaining class in EverQuest.<br clear=all><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><UL><H2>Stuff every Bard should know</H2><LI><A HREF="eqbardreqs.htm">Becoming an EverQuest Bard</A><LI><A HREF="spellsongs.htm">A List of Spellsongs</A><LI>Instruments in EverQuest (coming soon)</ul><p><ul><H2>Other Important Stuff</H2><LI><A HREF="joat.htm">Journal of a Traveler</A> - Follow Talies the Bard on his adventures in Norrath. <IMG SRC="updated.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=46 ALT="Updated!"><LI><A HREF="eqglossary.htm">The EverQuest Glossary</A> - A listing of common and uncommon words and phrases found in EverQuest.<LI><A HREF="http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/">EverQuest</A> - the greatest first-person graphic RPG EVER!<LI><A HREF="http://www.soerbaird.com/">Soerbaird</A> - A Bard's Guild.<LI><A HREF="http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/">The Concert Hall</A> - another site dedicated to Bards.<LI><A HREF="http://www.verant.com/">Verant</A> - creators of EverQuest!<LI><A HREF="http://eqss.stratics.com/">EQ Stratics</A> - News site with up-to-date information.<LI><A HREF="http://eq.stratics.com/evercrest/">EverCrest</A> - A great parody comic strip, very funny!<LI><A HREF="http://www.eqvault.com/">The EQ Vault</A> - Another news site with an up-to-the-minute server status report.<LI><A HREF="http://homelessproductions.com/ash/eq/">The Questor's Inn</A> - EverQuest fan fiction. <LI><A HREF="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/">The EQ'Lizer</A> - The most well-compiled collection of information about EverQuest.<LI><A HREF="http://eq-online.com/">EQ Online</A> - Yet another news site, this one also has a good equipment and spell list.<LI><A HREF="http://eqx.simplenet.com/">EverQuest Express</A> - A regularly published online 'zine dedicated to all things EverQuest.<LI><IMG SRC="new.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=26 ALT="New!"><A HREF="http://klaknak.everquest.gamestats.com">The Cackling Klaknak</A> - an EQ Humour Emporium<LI><IMG SRC="new.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=26 ALT="New!"><A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/">EverLore</A></ul><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 alt=" "></CENTER><!--Thank you everyone....--><table><TR><TD><a href="http://home.netscape.com/"><img src="../bards/aninet30.gif" align="middle" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=88 alt="View me with Netscape !"></a></TD><TD><center>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq - Master Bard</A><br>With special research assistance by Talies on Bristlebane<br>  And special thanks to <A HREF="http://www.locksley.com/">Ioseph of Locksley</A>, without whose constant inspiration to Bards everywhere, this page never would have been.</center></TD><TD><a href = "http://www.hippie98.com/"><img border=0 src="../bards/hiptag98.gif" align="middle" alt="Created with Hippie!" width=105 height=35></a></TD></TR></table><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><p><CENTER><p align="center"><strong><font color="#DD9505" face="Arial" size=-2>I am a proud member of</font></strong><br><img src="everring.jpg" width="200" height="75" alt="EverRing" border="0" usemap="#everring"> <MAP NAME="everring"><AREA HREF="http://eqss.stratics.com/everring/" SHAPE=rect coords="11,3,191,41" target="_blank"><AREA HREF="http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring=everring;id=65;prev" SHAPE=rect coords="11,41,65,70" target="_blank"><AREA HREF="http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring=everring;list" SHAPE=rect coords="82,41,125,66" target="_blank"><AREA HREF="http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring=everring;id=65;next" SHAPE=rect coords="136,41,194,68" target="_blank"></MAP></CENTER><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><p><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="../bards/back2bards_bw.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the Bard's Guild."></A><p><IMG SRC="http://www2.pinkpig.com/counter.count$amtgard/eqbard/font=brush" alt = "counter"><!-- Last modified on Sun Jun 13 18:44:17 1999 --></BODY></HTML>
