At a few events this year they decided to try torch-light fighting. While I did notpersonally fight in these, I have been in enough tourneys and fighterpractices where the final rounds were fought after the sun went down. Thetales I have heard from those who did participate matched my experiencesin night fighting.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="getalife.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Get a Life says the Baron)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="prothal.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Sir Prothal's Lament)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">27</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
