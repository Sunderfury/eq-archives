Asusually happens after such talks, I heard "Cover of the Rolling Stones" onthe radio and the title popped up. The Old Battered Helm is given out for aGlorious Death. The helm is an old freon  tank helmet. Each winner issuppose to make his mark on the helm with the weapon of his or her choicein front of witnesses. I am not sure if they still give it out.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="dukejade.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (I Fought Duke Jade and Duke Jade won)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="saveproblems.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Save the Problems for Tomorrow)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">64</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
