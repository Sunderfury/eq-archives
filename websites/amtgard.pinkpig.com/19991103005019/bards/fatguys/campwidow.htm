Her clan has a lot of kids. Both lords andladies in the clan DO share the burdens of watching the kids and keepingthe hoard fed. But on more than one occasion, you could hear the sighs ofrelief when kids were finally put down to bed and they could get out thedrums and start dancing.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="pool.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Fourteen Folks in the Fat Guy Pool)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="goodswing.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (I Took a Good Swing with My Mace)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">54</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
