Theminstrel's guild was hosting a &quot;Bard's Night&quot; event in late 1997. In theiranouncement, they had a statement that went something like &quot;this will beyour best chance to join and meet with the Minstrel's Guild and earn youribbons.&quot; Much too serious a tone.   I felt that the event needed somecomic relief. So I offered to teach a class titled &quot;<I>Filks in the the SCA</I>,or <I>How to shamelessly take somebody else's work and make it your own</I>.&quot;  Atthe time I had &quot;Autocrat, Autocrat&quot; in my &quot;works in progress file&quot; with justthe tune and first paragraph. I planned to have the class finish the songas a class project since everyone has been to the &quot;Event from Hades.&quot; Theevent got postponed for 5 months and I ended up finishing the song myself.I did eventually teach the class as planned, but they wouldn't use my titleand shortened it to &quot;Filk Writing.&quot; No sense of Humor.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="feathers.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (White Feathers/Blue Feathers)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="6beer.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (6 Beer Court in Drachenwald)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">17</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
