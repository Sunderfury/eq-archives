We have gone through several leaders of the Fat Guys since, all with their own legends, but Michael is a low standard that we try to follow. When I was suckered into leading the Fat Guys, this song came to mind. It sat around for awhile in my works in progress file, until I finally cranked it out.  <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="hebitme.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (He Bit Me)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="fatguyking1.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Fat Guy King)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">112</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
