At one fighter practice, JohnPerigrin (one of the better fighters in Drachenwald) was practicing a newseries of off-hand shots - lots of force with little accuracy. He managedto bruise me in about every unarmored spot possible. I had bruises on therump, under the armpit, under the tricept, inside the the thigh etc. Hemanaged to do the same to the other fighters that night as well. All  theseshots were legal blows. I started the song with this in mind, but whenwriting the song, it just worked better with illegal blows as the subject.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="onmythrone.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (On My Throne)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="sleep.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (The Fat Guys Sleep Tonight)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">22</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
