It is a very subjective issue, and each case definitely has more than one side. But in most tales, gossip, and downright backbiting, it almost always a case of he/she did not take the blow. Each area has its own calibration and what is good in local is "light" in another. Most experienced fighters will take care of this directly during the bout, and question each other on the spot. On rare occasions, when I am marshalling, I will take both fighters aside after a bout If I saw a blow or two that I thought was good. Most of the time both fighters will tell me that it was light. (which is why we usually leave it up to fighter unless they ask for our opinion.) While Rhino-hiding does occur, there are times where I feel that the label is used too easily. I have written a few songs against the Rhino, I felt it time to do one from the other viewpoint. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="wheelofdoom.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Wheel of Doom)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="peeragemeetings.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Peerage Meetings)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">120</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
