Sylia was very considerate to take me in on nothing more than a letter.  Seeing how poorly dressed I was, she even gave me an old padded tunic she had stored away from a previous student.  It fit well, if a bit snug, and I thanked her for her kindness.  When I asked if there was anything I could do for her in return, she thought for a moment, then said, "Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.  Our supply of lute strings is running rather low.  Around here, we use spiderling silk, as it's very durable, and somewhat plentiful.  if you run across any, bring it here.  Bring me enough of it, and I'll even see about a little something extra for you."<p>She smiled then, and sent me on my way.  My first Quest!  I only hope it doesn't take too long to complete it - I came here to learn how to sing and play music!<p><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><B>February 19th, 3172</B><p>Being a Bard is turning out to be much more difficult than I had ever imagined!  I've been in the Guild a week already, and I haven't even learned a song yet!  Mostly, I'm out, trying to gather spiderling silk - easier said than done.  Nothing to show so far, except a dozen cuts and scratches for my troubles.  Seems like every time I spot a spiderling, it heads off in the other direction, or a giant wasp or bat decide that I look like dinner.  At least wasp and bat wings are worth something in town.  Enough to keep me fed, anyway.<p>I also got attacked by a wolf yesterday.  I was bending down, trimming a wing off another of the giant wasps I'd had to kill, when I was suddenly attacked from behind.  It was a lucky thing I still had my sword nearby, or I'd've been killed for sure!  It had fur black as night, and eyes that glowed even to my elven-sight.  Fortunately for me, the last few days of fighting bats and wasps had taught me well.  Keepping my guard low, I waited for an opening.  The wolf managed to nip at me once or twice, nothing serious, but it wasn't until it jumped for my face that I was able to score the shot I wanted.  Lunging forward, I put my blade into it's ribcage, and it dropped like a bag of stones.  I was actually stunned that it worked, but I wasn't going to split hairs over my life here.<p>I went ahead and skinned it as well as I could, hacked off a little meat to take with me, and ran back to town.  On my way up the lift, a kind elven tailor noticed my burden and offered to buy the ruined skin for a few silver.  I took him right up on it, I hadn't expected to get anything for a pelt as badly hacked as that one was, but the tailor assured me that he could make anything out of any pelt, no matter how worn or tattered.  Patchwork armours were his specialty.  I wasn't going to complain - I had a few extra coins in my pocket, and a little more confidence in my own abilities.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat01.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat03.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
