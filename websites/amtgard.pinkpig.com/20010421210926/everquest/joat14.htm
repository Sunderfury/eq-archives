Round of face and body, his eyes twinkled as he greeted me. I introduced myself, and handed over my delivery, At first, Drekon seemed pleased, but as he read further, his brow wrinkled in concern. "Oh mymymymymy.  This is not good. No, not good at all.  It seems as though there's an excessive amount of activity going on in the Scrapyard.  And I've recently learned that several Gnomes have not reported back from trips down there.  We're going to have to send someone to investigate."  Suddenly, Drekon's eyes sparkled as he looked me up and down.  I was beginning to feel like a bug under glass, when he suddenly spoke again.<p>"So - feel like a bit of adventuring?"  I'm always up for an adventure, I told him, so he explained the situation.  With so many unexplained disappearances, and the log reports, he was just certain that Red 5 was back.<p>"Red 5?" I asked.  I know the road to enlightenment is paved with questions, but sometimes I really felt like a fool.<p>"Yes, Red 5," Drekon said in a hushed, almost reverent whisper.  "Red 5 was a clockwork gone rogue.  His model was made obsolete years ago, and he was scrapped with others of his series.  But something went wrong in his programming, and somehow, he rebuilt himself.  Some time ago, a party of adventurers tracked him down, and they said that they defeated him.  But they must have been wrong.  The only way I'll know for sure that he's dead is if I have his blackbox.  Go down there, see if he's still alive, and if he is - disassemble him.  Bring me that box, and I'll make sure you're well rewarded."<p>So - I was off on another adventure.  To the Scrapyard, it seems.  I had thought I'd been everywhere, but somehow, I didn't remember this place, so I asked a nearby Guidebot to lead me there.  After what seemed like hours of twisting narrow tunnels, the clockwork finally stopped in front of a giant metal wheel, stuck halfway into the running underground river, and turning slowly from the force of the water.  I turned to ask the mechanical guide about it, but she had already gone.  Shrugging, I turned, and started climbing down next to the waterfall.  There was bound to be an answer around here somewhere.<p>Near the bottom, I suddenly spotted a Gnome working on some machinery.  Naturally, he was on the other side of the falls, and no amount of yelling could get his attention.  Sighing in resolution, I jumped in, and struggled across the briskly flowing river.  Finally, I pulled myself free, and found myself sprawled at the feet of one "Sanfyrd Montop, owner and operator of the Scrapyard."<p>I had to shout to make myself heard over the falls, and it seemed that he was a bit hard of hearing to make matters worse.  After trading introductions, I asked him what he was doing down here.  "Buying and selling scrap.  Old broken boxes, worn-out microservers, you name it, I'll buy it!"<p>"What about that thing - what is it?" I yelled, indicating the huge wheel stuck in the water.<p>"That's the Great Wheel.  It provides power for over half of Ak'Anon.  It's a marvel really.  Harnesses totally natural water-power, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  I had heard that they were working on getting an extra day or two out of it, but it seems that project might take a little time." He chuckled at his own joke.<p>I shook my head, bewildered, but determined to learn something, I asked about Red 5.  I knew I must've said something right, because Sanfyrd's face went completely pale, and he looked behind me, as though expecting Innoruuk himself behind me. "Keep your voice down!!  That creature could be anywhere!"<p>"So he does exist!"<p>"Yes, " Sanfyrd shouted.  "He's real alright.  He lives in the Mines of Malfunction, with all kinds of other horrible atrocities.  If I were you, I'd head right back to the surface, and pray that Brell protects you the whole way."<p>"The Mines, huh?  Where are these Mines?"<p>Sanfyrd shook his head in disbelief.  Finally he shouted, "If you're that determined to get killed, the door's right behind you."  And with that, he turned back to tinkering with some machinery.<p>I turned around, not recalling any doors on my way down, but sure enough, hidden away in a recessed tunnel was a lone, rusted door. I crossed back over the river, and examined the entry. Guarded by a single clockwork, the door had the ominous warning of a single skull carved into the corroded metal.  I took a deep breath, then, with my shoulder to the door, I shoved.<p>And fell flat on my face, as the well-oiled hinges allowed the door to open nearly-soundlessly.  This door had been well used, it was immediately apparent, but by who yet remained a mystery.  I stood up, brushed myself off, and looked around, wondering who would be taking such good care of an abandoned place like this.  The door closed soundlessly behind be, cutting off the roar of the waterfall, and the sudden silence was overly-reminiscent of a tomb.<p>A feeling which was rather well supported as I turned the corner to leave the room, and came face to face with a rather well-preserved skeleton.  I squeaked, and began to fumble with my sword, when suddenly, the skeleton turned, and staggered down the hall in front of me.<P>"Come closer, boy."  The voice eminated from the room the skeleton had just entered, and had all the charm of a freshly exhumed corpse.  I shuddered, but my curiosity getting the better of me, I moved forward into the darkened room.  Suddenly, lights flared all around me, and I realized that I was surrounded by skeletons - big ones, little ones, rotting ones and fresh ones.  I closed my eyes for a moment, hoping it was all a nightmare, and I was just going to wake up in a moment.<p>"No dream, boy - this is real.  Tell us what brings a Half-elf, and a Bard no less, in the midst of the Dark Reflection?"  I opened my eyes to see who the speaker was, and realized that, in addition to the skeletons, there were also a few Gnomes, and a couple of old clockworks.  <p>I faced the speaker, a grizzled gnome, wrapped in faded green robes, and introduced myself.  "How pleasant," he chuckled.  "We don't get many visitors around here, so forgive our lack of manners. You may call me Dewis.  I am the Guildmaster to the Dead.  These are my fellow teachers and assistants.  And, of course, you've already met our pets."<p>I shuddered as I realized that I had found myself in the midst of the fabled Necromancer's Guild.  Oft-rumoured, but not well known, the Necromancers dealt in the dead the way Magicians dealt in the elements.  Somehow, these didn't look like the inhuman flesh-eating ghouls the stories made them out to be - but I still wasn't about to turn my back on them.<p>"You still have not answered my question, young Bard.  What brought you to the Mines of Malfunction?"<p>"I'm searching for Red 5." <p>A slight widening of the eyes was all that betrayed Dewis' interest in my quest.  The rest of his face remained calm as he enquired, "What makes you think he's real.  Or that he's even down here?"<p>"Let's just say I have my sources.  Do you mind if I take a look around?"<p>"Very well - the tunnel there leads deeper into the mines.  Disturb no skeletons, and they'll not disturb you.  But beware, there's things down there we have no control over - things that could easily kill you." A slight touch of humour entered his voice then, and I silently vowed to watch my back at all times down here.<p>I thanked Dewis for his help, and, pushing my way between skeletons, I left through the tunnel he had indicated.<p>The Mines were dark.  Very dark.  Strange sounds echoed off the walls, making things seem to be in front of me and right behind me all at the same time.  The darkness was periodically broken by the occasional light post, when they were still functional, but for the most part, I was relying on my Elven sight to get me through.<p>Suddenly I heard a faint ticking, the sound of a clockwork, and it appeared to be coming my way.  Drawing my sword, I pressed up against the side of the tunnel and waited.  The sound grew closer and closer, and I could hear mixed with the all-to-familiar ticking, the squeaking protest of unoiled metal.  As the sound approached the intersection I was at, I reared back, and swung the sword at chest height around the corner, hoping to land an early, lucky blow.  And winced as my longsword clanged rather loudly off the stone wall, swishing over the head of the rat-shaped clockwork.<p>I don't know who was more surprised - the clockwork, or me, but it turned tail and ran faster than I could follow.  I let it go, figuring that even if it did bring something back, better that then having to wander completely lost looking for this rogue clockwork.  When, after a few moments, I heard nothing more, I continued my quest for Red 5.<p>A couple of more times, I thought I spied the clockwork, as I heard a faint ticking in the distance, but every time I approached, it was to find an empty corridor or room.  One time, the room was not as empty, however, I found myself backing out as quickly as I had entered.  Several Gnomes dressed in black leather were hunched around a small chest, apparently trying to open it with small bits of wire.  As I backed away, I felt a prick in my back, accompanied by the words, "Just where do you think you're going?"<p>I stuttered for a moment, trying to explain who I was, and that I was just looking for Red 5, when one of the Gnomes said, "Let 'im go."<p>"But Kaxon, " my captor started. "He'll tell everyone what he saw."<p>"He won't be tellin' anyone anything when Red 5 gets through with him.  Now get him lost, and come back here - we haven't got long to get this open and back to the Vault."<p>Though muttering and grumbling, the young rogue led me down several corridors, sure enough I was lost by the time I suddenly realized he wasn't there anymore.  I was trying to figure out what had just happened when I heard that fateful ticking once more.  Quietly moving forward, I saw a lone clockwork standing in the middle of a room, as though waiting for something.  Or someone.  I had seen hundreds of clockworks in Ak'Anon, but I had never seen one that looked as ragged as this one.  It looked as though it was cobbled together from the spare parts of a dozen different series.  Mismatched legs caused it to stand at a slight angle, while the grinding noise from deep inside as it turned it's head to observe me told me that something wasn't quite right there, either.<p>"Red 5, I presume."<p>"You are no challenge.  You shall fall before Red 5 like all others have fallen before you.  Meldrath shall be pleased."  The emotionless voice left no doubt in my mind what this would have to come down to.<p>With that, I attacked.  Singing my battle song for inspiration, I swung high, hoping for a lucky shot to remove his head.  The sudden shock to my arm as my sword met unyielding metal almost caused me to drop my weapon, but I held on, and tried to duck as Red 5 began swinging.  He caught me rather solidly in the head, however, knocking me backwards, and stars swum in my eyes as I tried to recover.  Only the sheerest of luck kept my sword between he and I, and I soon found myself backed into the corner.<p>With no other alternative, and my vision finally cleared, I launched another series of attacks, this time focusing on the weaker joints where his arms were attached to his body.  As I gritted my teeth against the shock, my blows were finally rewarded with the sudden separation of his arm from his body.  Unfortunately, this didn't stop him as readily as it would have any normal creature, and I was caught by surprise as he punched me in the side with his remaining arm.<p>Stunned, I fell to the ground and rolled around, trying not to let him kick me as I recovered my breath.  Finally, I managed to push myself back to my feet, and swing once more.  Bristlebane must have guided my hand that time, as my sword arced across the faceplate of the mechanical monstrosity.  Lenses shattered, and the clockwork fell to the ground, stunned, as it were.  As I raised my sword for the final blow, I heard Red 5's final words.<p>"You haven't defeated Red 5! Red 5 will live on! Red 5 lives on!!!"<p>I swung then, separating head from shoulders, and was relieved as the final ticking whirred to a stop.<p>Red 5 was dead.<p>Having some experience at this now, I popped open the chest plate where the blackbox was held, only to reali...<p><I>(Part of the page has become wet and the ink has run)</I><p>...ebber was ecstatic that I had vanquished this truly fearsome foe.  He handed me a small purse of coins, as a reward for my effort, and even gave me a small potion bottle, a drink he said that would save me from hunger or thirst for a whole day!  I thanked him, then decided I needed a long rest.  The days battles had left me bruised and sore, but I really wanted to go home.  It was too late to start out tonight, so I found a warm spot next to one of the ubiquitous steam-machines, and caught up on my notes. I think tomorrow, I'll head home.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat13.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat15.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP><p> Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
