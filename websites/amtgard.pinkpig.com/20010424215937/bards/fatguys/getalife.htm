A response to some silly local politics that have been dragging on for the last few years in my local group. It got sobad at times that I used to sign off my E-mails with &quot;It's hard to livelarge when you live in Mayberry RFD.&quot; Leaving out specific names andincidents, the Barony got so disfunctional  that it was put under aVicker. We became a Barony again half a year ago and for the most part,things have been going well. But the &quot;Courtiers&quot; have started to surfaceagain. This song is my answer to the &quot;courtiers&quot; as they try to drag meinto their plots and schemes.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="nonogogo.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (The No-No, Go-Go Song)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="fightnight.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (They Made us Fight at Night)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">26</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
