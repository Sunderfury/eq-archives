He manages to live as large (or perhaps even larger) than the rest of us, gets the work done, keeps the business out of the camp and then plays as hard as the rest of us. The worst part is he makes it look so easy. He went and won the Crown of Drachenwald again. I have a theory about this. At the time of the crown lists, he was the acting Kingdom Seneschal. Winning the crown was the only way he could get outof that Job. : - ) After having done both jobs, the burdens of the crown seemed a lot more fun. This is probably one of the rare occasions where the workload (phone calls, Emails, etc) will actually decrease for the winner of a Crown Tourney. In any case, after ribbing him in song the first two times he won a crown, he and his most gracious lady deserved a nice song. This was started 20 minutes after he won, and finished about 2 hours latter. The Fat Guys tried to sing it towards the end of feast, But when the pointy hats saw us lining up, they quickly excused themselves for a peerage meeting (Almost at a deadrun). We got him with it latter after a few hours (and quite a few beers).    <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="drunkensquire.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (previous song)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="gorlanslament.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Gorlan's Lament)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">72</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
