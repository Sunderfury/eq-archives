In fact, there are really two different kinds of Bards: the battlefield Bard, and the Court (or campfire, or wherever) Bard.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">Bards on the battlefield are so much more than a fighting class.  Although they can use a wide variety of weapons and even a shield, they can also use spells and enchantments.  At higher levels, their abilities expand to include mimicking the abilities of other classes and using Druidic magic.  All in all this makes what starts out as a relatively weak class, very well-rounded, and extremely potent by sixth level.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">Off the field, Bards have a much different role.  Although not everyone who plays a Bard performs, those who do are generally welcome at any campsite or event.  And let's just say that being a Bard <I>can</I> have it's perks (&quot;A kiss from the Captain to parch my throat, and I'll sing ye a song or two!&quot;)<p><UL><H2>Rules and Laws every Bard should know</H2><LI><A HREF="amtgardrules.htm">The Rules for Playing Bard</A><LI><a href="http://www.amtgard.com/guide.html">Amtgard Rulebook</a> <LI><a href="http://www.amtgard.com/corpora.html">Amtgard Corpora</a> <LI><A HREF="http://www.amtgard.com/content.html">Dor Un Avathar, The Monster book, ONLINE!</A><LI><A HREF="http://horus.anth.utep.edu/~amtgard/jugging.html">Jugging!</A><LI><A HREF="http://horus.anth.utep.edu/~amtgard/mon/monweb1.html">The Monster Web Page</A><LI><A HREF="http://www.cport.com/~singh/bbard.html">The Dragonspine Experimental Bard Rules</A> - No longer played in Dragonspine<LI>The Wetlands Professions List</UL><UL><H2> Other Important Stuff   </H2><LI><a href="http://www.amtgard.com">Visit the Official Amtgard Web Page</A><LI><A HREF="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/atlas">The Amtgard Atlas - Online!</A><LI><A HREF="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/heraldry/index.html">The Amtgard Heraldry Guild</A>    <LI> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Cavern/9780/">The Adventurer's Guild Online!</a>     <LI> <a href="http://interoz.com/amtgard/gaming">The Amtgard Gamers Guild</a>     <LI> <a href="http://www.amtgard.com/~spirit/garb/">The Official Amtgard Garbers Guild Page</a>     <LI><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Loge/1605/">The Amtgard Juggler's Guild</A></ul><ul><H2>Other Fighting Guilds Online</H2>     <LI> <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/3167/ass.html">The Assassin's Guild</A>     <LI> <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/2490/index.html">The Barbarian's Guild</A>     <LI> <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/fl/monkguild">The Monk's Guild</a>     <LI> <a href="http://horus.anth.utep.edu/~amtgard/mon/monweb1.html">The Monster's Guild Page </a>     <LI> <A HREF="http://www.texasinternet.com/terarin/">The Scout's Guild</A>     <LI> <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Vault/6320/wg-index.html">The Warrior's Guild</A>     <LI> <A HREF="http://scf.nmsu.edu/~wg/wiz/main.html">The Wizard's Guild</A>     </UL><p><center><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></center><CENTER><H1>An Overview of the Bard</H1><p><img src="harper1.gif" align="right" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=176 WIDTH=176 alt="A lonely Bard"><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">The Bard, as it stands, begins as a relatively weak class, having no killing magic, and little offensive magic at all.  However, at higher levels, the Bardic abilities become so varied and powerful, that a sixth level Bard is virtually unstoppable on the battlefield.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">Now for a look at a few of the more popular Bardic spells...<p><H3><B><U>Presence</U></B></H3><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">Beginning Bards have a sort of &quot;professional respect&quot; from Monks and Druids (who won't attack a Bard unless they are of equal or higher level than the Bard).  And Barbarians, unless they are totally berserk, won't come near a Bard at all!  This all helps keep the young bard alive until he is of a significant enough level to do something back to the villainous critters... Of course, the respect only stands as long as the Bard doesn't throw the first shot.  If he does that, it's all over...<p><H3><B><U>Charm</U></B></H3><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">The Bard has the only truly &quot;User-definable&quot; spell in Amtgard: Charm.  Not only does the Bard get to choose what it sounds like when cast, but also what specific effect occurs (within reason).  She can basically control her victim for no more than five minutes, and, while she may not put her victim in danger (real or imagined), or force her victim to attack, ofttimes the humiliation factor is more than sufficient.   Charm is a great way to spread a message, embarrass a foe, or generally annoy the opposing team...<p><H3><B><U>Visit</U></B></H3><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">Talk about annoyance!  It sometimes seems as if that was the purpose of this spell.  The opportunity to visit the opposing team's base, unharmed, and make obnoxious noises as long as you want.  Some Bards like to use this offensively (pun intended), but many feel that it is a weak ability...<p><H3><B><U>Legend</U></B></H3><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">Another somewhat definable spell, Legend allows a Bard to take multiple opponents (and occasionally friends) out of the game for a brief period, during which time he must constantly perform for them.  No one within twenty feet may attack the Bard or his victims, giving the Bard a bit of a limited immunity.  Of course, twenty feet really isn't all that great, when you think about it....<p>  <H3><B><U>Emotion Control</U></B></H3><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">This is probably the single most popular Bardic spell, as it allows the Bard to grant players a temporary level raise.  Needless to say, this makes the 4th level Bard a very popular person, indeed...  However, a lot of people neglect the fact that this is a very versatile spell, allowing the Bard to instead Berserk a non-Barbarian, or make him immune to subduals, or charms or other emotional attacks.  Sometimes these abilities can be more valuable than an extra level or two.  In the long run, however, it's important to remember that this only lasts as long as the victim -er- target is alive (thirty minutes max).<p> <H3><B><U>Mimic</U></B></H3><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">This is a personal favourite of mine, as it allows a Bard to temporarily &quot;pretend&quot; to be another class of first level.  Now, it does only give him access to non-magical abilities, but then, what more does a Bard need, when he can wear armor, carry a huge shield, a sword or flail, and still cast magic?<p><H2><B><U>Voice</U></B></H2><IMG SRC="tab.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24 ALT=" ">The crown jewel in the Bardic list, and the only spell at sixth level, this grants the Bard the ability to use a minor amount of Druidic magic (only five points) but it is from any level of Druidic magic.  Can we say crispy critter? <p>  <IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 alt=" "><!--Thank you everyone....--><table><TR><TD><a href="http://home.netscape.com/"><img src="aninet30.gif" align="middle" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=88 alt="View me with Netscape !"></a></TD><TD><center>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq - Master Bard</A><br> &quot;The Happy Halfling&quot;</center></TD><TD><a href = "http://pages.prodigy.com/Hippie/"><img border=0 src="hiptag.gif" align="middle" alt="Created with Hippie!" width=105 height=35></a></TD></TR></table><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><p><br clear=all></center><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="back2bard_bodh.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=140 WIDTH=130 ALT="Back to the Bard's Guild."></A><p></font></BODY><!--Thanks to Terarin for extensive coding help.--><!-- Last modified on Sat Oct 31 06:18:19 1998 Happy Halloween! --></html>
