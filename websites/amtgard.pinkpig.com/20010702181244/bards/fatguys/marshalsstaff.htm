(This has since been written by someone else). But taking the same logic, it seemed to me a “Marshals staff standing up straight when he called hold”, had way too much bawdy potential. For those unacquainted with SCA fighting. The Marshals will normally have a long staff with stripes on it. When they call Hold, they raise it above their heads. All Fighting stops, and fighters drop to their knees. The fighters will stay on their knees until the marshal give them permission to rise. In the words of Tom Lerher “If correctly viewed, Everything is Lewd”. I worked on this one for over two years. I tried it to many tunes, themes and styles. Recently I bought a 1887 reprint of Merry Drolleries, first published in 1662. One of the songs in there was “My Mistress is a shuttlecock” (Recorded in the 1960’s by Ed Mccurdy). They words and tune just clicked.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="16beers.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (16 Beers)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="2rattan.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Give Me 2 Rattan Broadswords)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">81</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
