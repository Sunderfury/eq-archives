But with any system based upon subjective judgement and honor to determine wins, there is a lot of controversy. This has been going on as long as the SCA has been around. We even have special names for this. A &quot;Looker&quot; is a blow that, to the crowd seemed a good kill, but both the fighters agree was not. A &quot;Rhino Hide&quot; is a person who consistently fails to  acknowledge killing blows. This song is written from the perspective of an honorable fighter, who is tired of those who fail to fight fair. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="glorious.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Glorious, Glorious)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="ridecormack.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Ride, Cormack, Ride)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">86</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
