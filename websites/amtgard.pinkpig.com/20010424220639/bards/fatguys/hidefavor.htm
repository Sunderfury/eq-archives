We gave hima hard time the first few days because he wasn't wearing it. He finallyconfessed that he had lost it somewhere in the tent he was sharing withLuke the Fool and two other people. The Favor was finally found underLuke's bed, and for the rest of the event, there were jokes about the Countand the Fool playing hide the favor. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="tudorman.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Tudor Man)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="armorinsp.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Get Me to Armor Inspection on Time)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">35</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
