InDrachenwald the &quot;normal&quot; killing blow is about 3/5 the power that it takesin the West. To fight over here I  have had to power down my shots to avoidcomplaints. I have &quot;Powered up&quot; on more than one occasion, but I'llnormally stop fighting before I get to point of this song. The game stopsbeing fun when people are getting hurt. But I still get PO'ed when I land ashot hard enough to dent 14 ga. steel, and it's called light. The song is a resultof that frustration.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="firegod.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Fire God)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="encampment.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Fat Guy Encampment)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">38</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
