It was proclaimed to bea miracle. Latter he found twin red heads in the parking lot and convincedthem to attend the event. This was declared miracle number two. By thistime he a crowd following him around waiting for miracle number three. Heand Ullam Gallowglas were at a merchants booth looking at knives. Ullam wastesting the knife by drawinging it against his thumb. 1st try nothing. TheMerchant shapend it. Again nothing. It would slice paper but wouldn't cuthis hand. When Karl left he tried it again and gave himself a nasty cut.This was proclaimed miracle number three and Karl was declaired a Saint.The first verse was (I assume) written on the spot. I added verses two andthree and rewrote verse four. I have been unable to identify the author ofthe original song.     <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="libido.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Libido Man)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="thug.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Thug)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">30</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
