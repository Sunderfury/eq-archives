Ithas yet to see any water in it. But for some unexplained reason, it isalways full of people (At the time the song was written 15 was therecord.). The song describes what has happened in and around the pool overthe last four events. There may be more verses to come. And Who knows, oneday we may actually put water into it. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="sactheking.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Let's Sacrifice the King..)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="campwidow.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Camp Widow's Lament)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">53</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
