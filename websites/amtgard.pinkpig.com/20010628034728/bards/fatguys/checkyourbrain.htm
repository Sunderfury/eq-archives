There is no dispute that only peers have the right to vote on changes to the Kingdom laws. But in playing 25 years in the game, I never once agreed to stop thinking when I joined. I have known many, many, peers through the years, and most do not share this attitude. To take cheap shot, the ones that do generally have no life outside of the SCA and so try to enlarge what little power they have in the world. It's sad really. These songs are not especially intended for entertainment. My general reaction to such pettiness is to express it in song and then forget about it.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="kingdomneeds.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (What the Kingdom Needs Now is Laws...)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="peershavebrains.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Only Peers Have the Brains)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">115</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
