Too many monarchs, the worst part of the job is sitting in on the Peerage meetings when they occur.  There are some SCAdians who live for such meetings, while others avoid them like the plague. Whenever somebody mentions that they are going to fight for a crown, my normal reply is "Two Words - Peerage Meetings". This one is based upon a set of meetings at a Double wars a few years ago. We gave King and Queen a hard time when they finally dragged themselves back to camp and rubbed in all the fun that they missed. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="rhinosdefense.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Rhino's Defense)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="tothesea.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (To The Sea)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">121</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
