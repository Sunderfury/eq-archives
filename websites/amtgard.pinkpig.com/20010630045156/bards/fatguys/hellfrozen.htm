The person who was supposed to organize the fighting, had dropped out of the SCA. I heard about it two weeks before the event and volunteered to make sure we had at least a few fighters and folks in garb. I made lots of phone calls, brought extra tents so crash space would be available, provided stoves, etc. so people could cook. As it turned out, I did not need to worry. The two groups that were closest to the area came out in force and organized most everything that needed to done. A few days after I made all these calls, an event announcement showed up in the Dragon’s Tale (the kingdom newsletter) so the populace as a whole knew the event was taking place. The SCA had also had a  bad reputation from incidents in previous years, so we were at our best behavior. <br>Anyway because of these redundant efforts, the King and Queen of the Fair made me a Knight of  Munzenberg. Those who know me well would agree that I am definitely NOT Knight material. I recall a comment from Fat Guy Baron Adler: &quot;That has about as much chance of happening as Gorlan does of getting white belt.&quot; I admit it was very strange to be called &quot;Sir Gorlan,&quot; even if only in context of the  Fair. <br>The song is about that perspective.   <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="toosexy.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (I'm Too Sexy for My Armor)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="motherwitch.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (The Mother and the Witch)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">97</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
