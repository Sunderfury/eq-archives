Well when somebody gives me a tune and a title, many times a song just flows. That happened here. I had this one finished about an hour after he mailed me the idea. I have sat on it for several months, so his version got fixed in folks minds as the original. It was his idea after all. But I never like to let a work go to waste, so I include it here. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="threetimesaking.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Three Times a King)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="dontboast.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Don't Boast if you Can't Deliver)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">127</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
