He recently move here from Atenvelt. I have no clueif there is any truth behind the tale, but when I heard it, I was almostrolling on the floor. The story was just too good not make into a song. Theyear was chosen for the rhyme. I cannot recall which Estrella that thestoryteller said this happened at. The Landsknecht were a band of early16th century mercenaries known for their multicolored, slashed clothing.  Awell done piece of Landsknecht garb will overload your eyeballs. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="destroyer.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Destroyer of the Armies)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="rounds.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Fat Guy Rounds)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">68</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
