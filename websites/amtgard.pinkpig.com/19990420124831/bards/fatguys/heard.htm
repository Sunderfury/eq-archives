No one really pursued thistoo far, SCAdians tend to respect others privacy. Again it is notsurprising that no one admitted to the deed. Most of the Lords that Iassociate with do not discuss encounters with a Lady. But there manydiscussions in a humorous mode. One Lady saying to her Lord that itsbeen a while since he made her scream. One Lady when describing it to thosewho slept through the night,  called it the &quot;**** heard around the world.&quot; Shethen challenged me to write a song about it. This was the result.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="knightsquire.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Knight My Squire)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="sven.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Sven)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">46</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
