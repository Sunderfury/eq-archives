I was out hunting today, when a giant widow hatchling dropped down from the trees, and without hesitation, I charged.  Stupid, really, now that I think about it, but at the time it seemed like a good idea.  Turns out, things with eight legs are much harder to fight than things with only two or four.   Everytime I thought I had the upper hand, it turned out to have six more!  At one point, it even managed to bite me, and I immediately began to scream at the burning from the poison coursing through my veins.  I was in so much pain, I nearly forgot everything I had learned.  Suddenly, the pain faded, and I looked around to see a nearby druid finishing off her spell.  Thanking her for the timely assistance, I turned my attentions back to the vile arachnid.  Chanting my battle song, I swung again and again, hacking limbs and sending black blood flying until, with a final scream, the spider fell dead.  Panting, I knelt beside the corpse, and cut it open, looking for the precious silk.  Luck was with me, and I bundled the silk up and took it back with me to the Guild to rest.<p>Sylia was pleased, but she needed more she said.  I'm beginning to wonder if maybe she isn't just trying to get me killed?  Seriously, though, it looks like I've got some difficult hunting in front of me to complete this Quest.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><B>March 26th, 3172</B><p>Well, it's been a while since I've had anything interesting to report.  Mostly, I've been hunting and practicing my songs.  Today, though, something happened.  I finally killed an orc!  Mostly, whenever I saw an orc, I just ran for the nearest guardpost, or found a group of rangers or something - but today, I was farther out than I normally go.  <p>I had been hunting wolves, which meant ranging out farther and farther each day, and today was no exception.  I stepped around a large stump and came face to face with an orc pawn.  To tell the truth, I don't know who was more startled - me or the orc!  We both stood there for a second, each trying to decide whether to fight or run.  Finally, he decided it for both of us, and, raising his mace, he growled and charged.  No more hesitation in my own mind, I began my warchant, and raised my own blade to meet his attack.<p>The fight was long and furious, and I thought for sure one of us was going to drop from sheer exhaustion if nothing else, when he suddenly stumbled, leaving his neck wide open.  I swung with all my might, and a shock ran up my arm as I connected with the bared flesh.  The orc gurgled and groaned, trying to claw me and hold his own throat at the same time.<p>As blood flowed down the orc's chest, and he slowly sank to his knees, then collapsed, I couldn't help but feel a little sick.  I had never before killed another sentient creature... I didn't know how to react.  I picked up the bloodstained mace, and in a sort of daze, wandered back to Kelethin, and the Songweaver's Guild, to talk with Sylia.<p>Sylia was very kind, she took me into the back room, where they were playing some soothing hymns, and we talk for several hours about what had happened, and why I felt the way I did.  I couldn't understand why we had to be at war, but Sylia explained that we had long tried to make peace with Emperor Crushbone and his orc tribe, but every time he promised peace, he'd turn around and kill a guard or slaughter an ambassador or loot a village.  This last time was simply too much, the elves could stand by no longer and watch him enslaving our people and killing innocent children.<p>I didn't feel much better about it, but I told Sylia I'd be thinking long and hard about it.  She smiled understandingly, then put her arm around my shoulder as she said, "You've learned well from us, but you've learned even more from your experiences in the world.  I'm advancing you to the next rank.  Perhaps it's a bit early, but I think you're ready for it."  I nodded numbly, somehow, even the new rank didn't wash away the sick feeling in my stomach.<p>Beleth came back then, and tried to cheer me up.  He decided to distract me with a new song he had just gotten in from Erudin, Lyssa's Locating Lyric.  Such a strange melody it has.  Very good for clearing my mind, as it forces me to focus on a single thing.  The truly unusual quality of this song is that it actually puts me in tune, so to speak, with the world around me - such that I can actually sense where things are, without even being able to see them.  Very strange indeed.  Right now, I still need a person to focus on to form the link, but Breleth says that someday I won't even need that.  Amazing, simply amazing.  It may not keep me alive, but I can see some potential for this song already.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat05.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat07.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
