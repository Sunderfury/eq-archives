As a rule they are full of envy for other people's accomplishments, and seem to feel that because another is succeeding, it somehow diminishes them. One clear case was a Knight who while a very good fighter, was a un-charismatic teacher. Gifts fall where they may. A very experience fighter, who was an authorized Marshal though not a Knight, was teaching glaive to some Lords who had asked him for instruction.  Now this Lord was an excellent teacher. I would almost always stop what I am doing when he gives one of his lessons. They are a pure joy to watch. This Knight came up to him and told him that only Knights should be teaching fighting and told him to stop. I could see a new law coming if that Knight ever won the crown. The chorus to this song came to mind then. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="fatguyking1.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Fat Guy King)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="checkyourbrain.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Check Your Brain at the Troll)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">114</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
