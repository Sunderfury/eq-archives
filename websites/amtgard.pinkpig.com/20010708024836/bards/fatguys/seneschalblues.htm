The Local Seneschal performs one of the toughest jobs in the SCA. These people are the ones in my mind who really keep the SCA working. They have to be manager, baby sitters, confessors, etc. The song describes what a new Seneschal might expect. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="3mavens.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (3 Authenticity Mavens)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="toosexy.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (I'm Too Sexy for My Armor)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">95</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
