I am not saying that you don't need to practice, and drill, but your greatest fighting skill is between the ears. Every time you walk out on the field, Say to yourself "I OWN IT". This does not guarantee you will win, but without that attitude, you will surely lose.  If you let yourself get intimidated because your opponent is a Knight, Earl, Duke, etc, you are defeating yourself.  This song is an expression that attitude. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="waronceagain.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (I'm in a War Once Again)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="hebitme.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (He Bit Me)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">110</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
