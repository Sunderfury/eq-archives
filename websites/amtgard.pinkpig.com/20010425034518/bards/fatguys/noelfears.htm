And I hate to admit it that many SCAdians I have known can get verysnobbish when dealing with or discussing Live Role players or LARFS. To mymind there are only two significant differences. 1) In the SCA we fight atfull force. 2) The live role players use Spell, Bards, Clerics, etc givingthere battles more of a Dungeons and Dragons/Fantasy flavor. I've had funin both environments. I don't see either one as the &quot;Correct&quot; way to play,just different.  The intention of this song is poke fun at some of theattitudes I have heard expressed. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="sheepgarter.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Sheep and Garter Raids)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="sactheking.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Let's Sacrifice the King..)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">51</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
