But there is only oneheavy fighter, who also happens to be a Fat Guy (Floris) . We refer to himas the Dutch Army.  The Knick Knack Tournament was held the same weekend asthe German elections. So very few people from Germany Attended. Those whodid were mostly Americans. To the North in Sweden there was another event,so none of their fighters came down. It was still a fine event, but onlythree heavy weapons fighters came with armor. Myself, Baroness Sylwien, andthe Dutch Army. The Tournament was still held and we had fun. When It wasannounced that Baroness Sylwein won, Lord John Called out "All HailBaroness Sylwein, Destroyer of Armies".  I had two fighting tabards withme. My Fat Guy Tabard and My Baronial Tabard.  Floris put on his Fat GuyTabard and the Baroness put on her Baronial Tabard. Talk about a conflict!.I ended up fighting with my Fat Guy Tabard(it had a pocket for mycigarettes), thus the treachery.  Fluffy is how the Baroness describes herpersona.   <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="pummelhim.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (I Will Pummel Him)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="landsknecht.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Landsknecht at Estrella)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">67</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
