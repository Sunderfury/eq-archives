Ak'anon is simply astonishing, and nearly indescribable.<p>I woke up this morning refreshed, despite my fears that the rumbling of the windmill would keep me awake.  Actually, after a bit, I found it rather soothing, and soon nodded right off, and slept soundly until first light. I awoke to some noises outside the windmill, and seeing Frebin gone, I decided to investigate.  <p>Outside, it was like some horrible nightmare, bodies lay everywhere! Elves, Gnomes, Dwarves, I even saw a human or two!  A few survivors were saying some words over the dead, or tending to their own wounds, and faintly, in the distance, I heard a tremendous roaring, the sound of which sent chills down my spine.  Spying Frebin talking to the watchman, I asked what had happened.<p>"The Hero got 'em."  I must have looked confused (a perpetual look, no doubt), because Frebin continued, "He's about the biggest, meanest, ugliest Minotaur of them all.  He eats adventurers for lunch, and spits 'em out like seeds.  Oh - they think they're all brave, going into the mines, challenge a few minotaurs.  Maybe, if they're lucky, they'll even bring back a horn or one of those prized axes as a trophy.  But more often than not, they come running back, tails between their legs.  Or they don't come back at all.  This group was lucky.  If you can call it that.  Someone had the kindness to drag their bodies here, so at least they'll get a decent burial.  Brell only knows what happens to the bodies of those that don't make it."<p>I shuddered once more, then decided to be anywhere but here for a while.  Ak'Anon sounded like a good idea last night, and as the sun began to creep over the mountains, it was sounding more and more like a great one.<p>Frebin was kind enough to point me down the correct path, back the way I came, then left at the first guardpost, and I'd see Ak'Anon soon enough.  He was right - I hadn't been walking for more than an hour when the huge mountain Ak'Anon is built into came into sight.<p>Surrounded by small Gnome huts and strange mechanical devices hissing as they occasionally let off steam, the entrance looked somewhat foreboding, and I began to wonder if this was truly the "wondrous" home city of the Gnomes after all.  But with two guards standing at perfect attention flanking the huge entranceway, I decided that there was nothing to do but enter.<p>Eerie green crystals floating above pedestals alternated with strange bubbling devices to provide light in these caverns, making the trip somewhat more unnerving than it needed to be.  Instead of the usual all-pervasive silence one would expect from a cave, however, this place was full of sounds and life.  As I turned a corner, bidding the sun a last fond farewell, I came face-to-face with (and nearly tripped over) a mechanical man!  I had thought Charlotte was incredible, but here, an actual man, standing, and staring at me!  And it talked!<p>"Excuse me sir, can't you see I'm busy?"<p>In my nervousness, I could do little more than laugh as I stumbled out of his way, and, looking at him over my shoulder, I almost tripped over another mechanical creation - this one in the form of a small rat, but with brushes and other strange accoutrements.  Things were going from strange to worse around here.<p>Following the corridor, I stepped into a small workshop, where several smaller versions of Charlotte sat, ticking quietly away.  That was what was so strange about this place - everywhere I went, I could hear ticking...  That could really get on a guy's nerves after a while.<p>I noticed a Gnome in the corner working on some machinery, and I approached him to ask a little about this place before I got too lost in it, but one glare from him, and I backpedaled right out of the room - and promptly fell down a steep slope.  Nothing hurt by the fall other than my pride, so I got up, dusted myself off, and looked around to see where I was.<p>My tolerance for the incredible was truly being stretched to the limit, so I took it on sheer faith that what I saw could exist, for here, stretched before me, was an enormous cavern bisected by a huge wall made entirely of metal.  Clockwork watchmen stood guard, and other mechanicals roamed the cave in some strange sort of dance, performing, I assume, their routine chores.  As I approached the wall, my eyes kept trying to assimilate and comprehend the size of it, but it wasn't until I was standing right next to it, beside one of the clockwork guards, that I truly began to appreciate the talents of the Gnome craftsmen.  They may be small, but they have no hesitation in building big when they need to.<p>I passed through the gate, and found myself following another of the ubiquitous clockwork spiders, as it led me down deeper into the earth.  Just as I began to wonder where I was being led, the tunnel opened into a vista that boggled my already nearly-overloaded mind.  An impossibly huge cavern housed the largest body of water I had ever seen!  A small path skirted the edge in both directions, and a pier, and even full buildings were perched out on the lake as though they belonged there and not the water.  A huge waterfall fed the lake, and I could see another tunnel at the far end of the cavern where the water probably flowed out.  Open-mouthed in astonishment, I simply stood there for a while, trying to take it all in.<p>I couldn't guess how long I'd been standing there, save to say that it was long enough for my foot to fall asleep, when a Gnome dressed in a bright yellow robe brushed past me with a mumbled apology.  "Excuse me, " I called out, as I started to follow him.  "Can you tell me whe-" As I stepped down onto the sleeping foot, I fell flat on my face, and gasping from the fall, I watched as the Gnome scurried out of sight.<p>As I lay there, recovering my breath, I heard a soft chuckling behind me. Turning, I saw nothing but a wheelbarrow full of fish and a glowing bubbling light pedestal.  Deciding I had been hearing things, I turned back towards the lake, and said to myself aloud, without really realizing it, "I'm here.  Now what do I do?"<p>  "OOoh but there's plenty to do in the clockwork town, my lad! Plenty, plenty, indeed!"<p>  I glanced around, and seeing nothing once more but the pedestal and the wheelbarrow, I addressed my comments to the air, "Who's there?"<p>  The pedestal turned to me and said, "Oh, never mind that, my lad - you've got to hurry along!  Go see Manik, he'll give you something to do, I'm quite sure.  Yes, quite sure indeed!"<p>  I started to ask more questions, but suddenly, the pedestal began glowing brightly, then just faded away.  As I turned away to seek out this Manik person, I heard one last comment from the air:  "He's in Gemchopper Hall.  And be careful - there's things in Ak'anon that no one had ever dreamed existed..."<p>"But wait! Where is Gemchopper Hall..." I trailed off as I realized that the strange person had gone.  <p>Suddenly, one of the clockwork people standing near me came to life and began speaking:  "Gemchopper Hall is the headquarters of the Gemchoppers, the warriors of Ak'Anon.  All Clockworks and Watchmen operations are directed by the great Gemchopper Guild Masters. Have a grand visit."  The mechanical man's lantern lit up, and he began walking along the path circling the lake.<p>Shrugging at my good fortune, I followed the guide, all the while gazing in awe at the things around me.  The clockwork kept up a consistant chatter, discussing various operations and locales in Ak'Anon, most of which I missed trying to take in the full beauty of the enormous underground lake - Lake Tildunk according to my guide.  So much water, all in one place...<p>As we passed into a tunnel, I began to focus more on the walls and floor, amazed at the incredible worksmanship.  No marks marred the surface to betray how these tunnels were created - whether by magic, or some marvelous technology, I'm sure I'll never know.<p>Suddenly, I realized that the clockwork guide had stopped, and was walking back the way we came.  Stepping aside to let him pass, I decided I must be at Gemchopper hall, though no signs indicated that this was the place.  Spying a small door set back in the wall, I opened it, and found that it led to a series of small tunnels.  They had to lead somewhere, so I ducked under the doorframe, and began hunting down this Manik fellow.<p>It wasn't long at all before I found him - in fact, he was in the first room I checked.  He was a tough-looking Gnome, the sort that looked like he could chew through steel doors, and a glint in his eyes that said he would, too, just to get his daily minerals.  Manik Compolten, Guildmaster of the Gemchoppers of Ak'anon, he called himself.  I introduced myself, and he looked me up and down, appearing a bit disappointed at my Half-elven heritage.  After a long silence, he asked me what I wanted in Gemchopper Hall.<p>"Well, I'm new to Ak'Anon, Manik, and you're probably not going to believe this, but a light fixture told me to come here."<p>"Oh that was probably old Berthold.  He's always pulling pranks like that.  One of these days, he's going to turn himself into a piece of garbage and get recycled.  Anyway, he must have overheard me commenting that I'm understaffed today, since I had to send an extra unit out to Steamfont."  He gave me that same critical once over again, harrumphed, and said, "Well, I guess you'll do.  Here, take this."<p>He reached behind him, grabbed a small card, and handed it to me.  It was a keycard, he explained, rather like a key for a lock.  Only this one opens locked clockworks.  Some of the clockworks hadn't reported in yet, so he wanted me to go get their blackboxes, so he could review their logs.  It sounded easy enough, so I took the keycard, and headed out.  <p>"Easy enough" - boy was I mistaken. I've been hunting for over two hours now, and I haven't found the first one!  If nothing else, at least I am getting to see Ak'Anon.<p>I decided to take a bit of a break, eat something, and write down a few notes here.  Maybe after lunch I'll have some better luck.<p> <CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat11.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat13.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP><p>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
