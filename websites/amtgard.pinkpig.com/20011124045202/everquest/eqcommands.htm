As this becomes outdated, please refer to your EQ Manual in your EverQuest directory.  Special thanks to Skip Sanders, for compiling the original raw information, and to the anonymous email that had the GM and Guide command clarifications.  Hope it's accurate...  Also, special thanks to Toleraen, High Wizard of the Nameless, who provided a large number of socials.<p>Commands followed by options in parentheses ( ) are intended to be used as follows - for <B>/command (option1, option2)</B> - usage would be <p><B>/command option1</B><p>Not all commands are available to every player. Some commands are limited to use only by GMs or Guides.  Don't even bother trying them - these commands are controlled by the server. <br> Generic emotes/socials with no associated animation are not listed here as they really provide nothing but flavour for the game, and are pretty hard to misuse.  Look in your manual for a complete listing of socials.<p>Commands in <B>BLACK</B> are available to all players.Commands in <B><font color="blue">BLUE</font></B> are Emotes with associated actions and are available to all players.<br>Commands in <B><font color="red">RED</font></B> are not implemented yet, or are no longer used.<br>Commands in <B><font color="green">GREEN</font></B> are Guides and GMs only - <B><I><font color="green">ITALICIZED GREEN</font></I></B> commands are limited expressly to GMs.<br><br>Last Modified November 8, 2001.<br>New definitions are marked with <IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=26 ALT="NEW!!!">.<br>Updates are marked with <IMG SRC="updated.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=46 ALT="Updated!">.<p><hr><p><IMG SRC="updated.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=46 ALT="Updated!"><B>%</B> - (percent sign) Targeting variable for emotes and public channels (<B>/Say</B>, <B>/Shout</B>, <B>/OOC</B>, <B>/Auction</B>, <B>/Group</B> and <B>/Guild</B>).  There are several %-variables that can be used, and all affect the targetted player or mob:  [Not currently available]<ul><li><B>%T</B> - Returns the current target's name. <br>ie, "<B>/emote kicks %T</B>" if used when targeting Aradune would return <B><I>Talies kicks Aradune</I></B>.<li><B>%S</B> - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It)<br>ie, "<B>/say %S likes me, %S really likes me!</B>" returns <B><I>Talies says, "He likes me, he really likes me!"</I></B><li><B>%O</B> - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It)<br>ie, "<B>/shout By the power of Tunare, I resurrect %O!</B>" returns <B><I>Talies shouts, "By the power of Tunare, I resurrect him!"</I></B><li><B>%P</B> - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its)<br>ie, "<B>/emote pokes %T in %P bum</B>" returns <B><I>Talies pokes Aradune in his bum</I></B>.<li><B>%R</B> - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters)<br>ie, "<B>/emote thinks that being a %R rocks.</B>" returns <B><I>Talies thinks that being a Halfling rocks.</I></B><li><B>%C</B> - Returns the class of the target (only works on Player characters)<br>ie, "<B>/ooc I love %Cs!</B>" returns <B><I>Talies says out of character, "I love Rangers!"</I></B></ul><B>Also, emotes with animations can now be customized.  Any canned emote can have another target than the current specified by inputting it's name. <br>For example, <B>/point Abashi</B> while targetting Aradune will yield <B><I>Talies points at Abashi</I></B>. [This is currently functioning as intended]<br></B>But wait - there's more!<br>Canned emotes can also include % variables, but for it to work, the target must be specified as <B>say</B>.  For example, "<B>/kneel say kneels before %T and humbly asks %P forgiveness for using %P name in vain.</B>" would yield <B><I>Talies kneels before Aradune and humbly asks his forgiveness for using his name in vain.</I></B><p><B>:</B> - (colon) Abbreviation for <B>/emote</B>.

For instance, typing "<B>/note This is a note</B>" will put "<B>This is a note</B>" on the next line in the notes.txt file.  <p><B>/ooc</B> - Communications channel for out of character conversation, such as stock prices, best video card or equipment statistics.<p><B>/pause [###]</B> - Used in social macros, the <B>/pause</B> command allows you to define a delay in between actions.  The delay is specified by ###, where the number is from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. <B>/pause 100</B> will yield a 10 second pause). For example, a social consisting of: <ul>                            <B>/sit off <br>                            /cast 1<br>                            /pause 100<br>                            /sit on </B></ul> ...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down. <br>The <B>/pause</B> command can also be used on the same line as another command in a social by separating the commands with a comma.  Note that you can only include pause on the same line like this, no other commands will work "stacked" like this.  No matter where the <B>/pause</B> appears (whether before or after the other command on that line), it will be executed AFTER the other command on that line.  For example: <ul>                            <b>/sit off<br>                            /pause 100,/cast 1<br>                            /sit on </b></ul>...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a <B>/pause</B> command from other commands, and the <B>/pause</B> MUST appear first on any line it shares with another command.  <p><IMG SRC="new.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=26 ALT="NEW!!!"><B><I><font color="green">/permakill</font></I></B> - GM Command.
