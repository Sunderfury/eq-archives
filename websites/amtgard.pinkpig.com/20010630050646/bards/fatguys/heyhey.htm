And I have to admit it really p*ssed me off for a few days this time. Sometimes it’s just to say &quot;So?&quot;  Hypocrisy bothers me. At the same event that she was complaining about us, she passed out drunk in the feast hall and had be carried to her room. As far I can recall, all the Fat Guys made to our beds under our own power. Yet she goes around to other members of the Barony saying things like &quot;We don’t want a bunch of drunken Fat Guys to come this Demo, that’s the last thing we need.&quot; The Fat Guys to my knowledge have <B>never</B> set up an encampment at a Demo. Most of us have been playing the game long enough to know where and when certain behaviors are allowed or not. In any case after a cooling off, this song was the result. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="somebeer.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (There's Some Beer)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="chainmail.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (That's the Sound of the Men Fighting in Chainmail)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">75</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
