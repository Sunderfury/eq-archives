He only wrote one verse and I was going to try and finish it, but this came out instead. Not as humorous as I would have liked. Each verse is based upon things I have observed or been told recently. In one case I was asked to mediate a case of gossip between the gossiper and gossipee. Another from some hateful &quot;Targeting&quot; said by a Hat Chaser about another. Another verse came from one Lord criticizing a group of others for not doing something that he <B>also</B> would not volunteer for. As fun playing in the SCA is, these things can get me down at times. Writing this one helped get some of it out of my system, but I don't think I will be singing it too often. Even with the humorous slant, it depresses me.  <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="meanshield.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Sure is a Mean Shield Wall)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="thankgod.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (At Times, I Thank God for the SCA)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">100</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
