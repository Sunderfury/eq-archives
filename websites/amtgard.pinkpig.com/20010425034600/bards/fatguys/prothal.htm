Sir Prothal has had a long standing feud with the combatarchers. Last year at the Double Wars he went around and congratulatedevery fight who killed and archer, no matter what side they fought on. Thereferences in the song about standing still for the Queen, came from onefield battle where the then Crown Princess was chasing him all over thefield shouting &quot;Will you stand still?!&quot; Sir Prothal is from Sweden and forsome unexplained reason most of the Swedes are very fond of Mountain Dew.It is one of the preferred bribes for their mercenary fighters. They do notsell it there so it is a very precious item. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="fightnight.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (They Made us Fight at Night)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="libido.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Libido Man)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">28</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
