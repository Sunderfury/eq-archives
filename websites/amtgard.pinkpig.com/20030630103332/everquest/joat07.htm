After hunting for days, I lucked into a small nest of widow hatchlings, and with some help from a few nearby rangers, we hacked and mangled them until nothing was left but a few chopped limbs, and a couple of scattered eyes.  And the precious silk, of course.<p>I gathered up as much as I could carry, then ran straight back to Kelethin, both to recieve my reward, and to get some healing from a few of the nastier bites I got.  Sylia was incredibly pleased to see the silk, and immediately set one of the apprentices to spinning it into strings.  Turning back to me, she congratulated me on a job well done, then reached into her purse and pulled out a single gold coin.  Pressing that into my hands, she smiled as she thanked me.  I started to turn away, but she said, "Wait, I almost forgot."  Then, with that secretive smile of hers, she said, "I believe this is yours?" as she motioned me to turn around.  There, Merchant Tenra, our local purveyor of instruments and assorted articles, was holding out a fine hand drum and stick.  My jaw dropped - I knew how much those drums cost.  Surely I hadn't earned that, and I said as much.<p>"Not only have you earned these rewards, Talies, but one other as well:  You are now a Journeyman Bard.  Welcome to the next rank.  Now let's go work on that drumming skill!"<p>If it was at all possible for my jaw to drop any further, it did then.  I must have looked like the entrance to Crushbone, because Beleth asked me what orc feet tasted like.  We all laughed at that, and then spent the rest of the night enjoying fine songs, drumming, and a bottle of good elven wine Sylia had been saving to celebrate something like this.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><B>April 4th, 3172</B><p>Today I asked Sylia what the title "Journeyman" meant.  She explained that Bards had long been used as messengers of the world, carrying secret documents and peace treaties from one side of Norrath to the other.  "But why Bards?" I asked, "Why not enchanters who can go everywhere disguised, or Wizards who can just POP there?"  <p>"Because, not everyone trusts a spellcaster, and while we may have a bit of magic in our songs, it's subtle enough not to be noticed.  Plus, we have a few secrets of our own.  Perhaps it's time for Beleth to teach you this one." <p>With that, she motioned Beleth to come over, and instructed him to teach me a very old, very powerful spellsong called Selo's Accelerando.  I'd often heard about the power of the Bard's songs making a trip seem to go by faster, but until I actually used this song, I never understood what they meant!  When I'm singing this song, I feel like I can run forever, and when I play the drum for accompaniment, the forest floor seems to fly beneath my feet!<p>Just for fun, I decided to try out the song, and see how long it took to run all the way to Felwithe.  I knew the paths there were fairly well-traveled, so I wasn't very afraid of getting lost.  Nevertheless, I still go turned around more than once on my way there.  Though it took a couple of hours, I finally reached the glorious High Elf city of Felwithe.   It's amazing, all walls and stone.  I could get lost here if I wasn't careful.<p>I think I'm going to stay here a few days and explore.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat06.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat08.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
