Sorry, They've gone beyond the point of silly toStupid. At Nebulungen III, we had a flood of people coming to ourencampment Crying "Sanctuary". We actually had to make a beer run onSaturday to restock. We didn't have the heart to turn away the refugees.The dream has room many diverse ways of playing. What bothers me is when anindividual tries to FORCE his/her view on everybody else. My view point hasalways been, if you have a strong view, Live it. Those who agree willemulate, those who don't, won't. If you find yourself sitting alone in yourcamp at night, then maybe you should do some serious soul searching. Theremay be a reason why people are staying away.     <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="rhinowhy.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Rhino Why Don't You Acknowledge My Blows?)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="greifenthal.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (The Tale of Greifenthal)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">57</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
