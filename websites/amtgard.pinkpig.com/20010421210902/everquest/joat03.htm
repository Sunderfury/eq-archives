Sylia felt bad about how hard I was working, and took me aside to teach me one of her favourites.  "The Chant of Battle," she calls it, and she said that it would help inspire me to greater things.  You know, I think she's right, too, because whenever I'm singing it, I feel like I'm stronger somehow.  I even seem to fight better! Anyway, she said she'd show me more later, but to go and practice singing every chance I got.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="note.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=582 ALT=" "></CENTER><B>February 22nd, 3172</B><p>It's never the same twice around here.  Just when I thought I'd seen everything, today, I saw the dead walking.<p>I was out hunting (as usual), trying to collect more wolf pelts, since they seem to sell so well, when I heard this hideous cackling noise.  I turned around, and nearly jumped out of my own skin, because there, walking around like it owned the world, was a skeleton, with strange glowing eyes.  A bit decayed, perhaps, but then, I hadn't seen too many of the walking dead to judge it against.<p>It was probably fortunate for me that it was so decayed, because it chose that moment of my hesitation to attack.  Swinging an old rusty longsword at me, I barely parried in time to prevent losing my head.  The creature cackled, as though it thought it had the upper hand, and that gave me just enough time to thrust at it, like I'd done with many a wolf or bat.  Wrong move.  My blade slid right between the bones, barely even scratching it!  The skeleton, still cackling, swung again, this time hitting me pretty solidly, but didn't get through my padded tunic, thank the Gods for dull weapons!<p>Changing my tactics, I swung at the skeleton as hard as I could.  Fortunately, the stupid thing didn't even bother to block, it just stood there, and I was rewarded with the satisfying smash as I shattered several of it's ribs.  Amazingly, at least to me, it was still standing, completely unfazed by the devasting blow, and it swung at me again, this time aiming for my head.  I ducked just in time, and followed through with a mighty heave at one of the skeleton's legs - I figured, at the very least I could cripple it.  It was no good, though, as my blade turned at the last minute, and I hardly did more than chip it a little.  Something had to give, and soon, before I found myself in the same condition as the creature I was fighting!<p>I stepped back for a second, guarding myself from the skeletons blows, looking for an opening, and analyzing what had happened so far.  Faintly, I realized that I had begun quietly singing the battle chant Sylia taught me, and with new-found courage, I stepped in, raised my sword high, and smashed it again and again.  Finally, the skeleton lay still, nothing more now than a bunch of broken bones, and a lonely-looking longsword.<p>Slowly recovering my strength, I gathered a few of the bones as evidence that this had really happened, and then, on second thought, I picked up the sword as well.  Hefting it, I realized that despite it's age and previous owner, the sword was actually in fairly good condition, and quite a bit heavier than my own old short sword.  Provided that it didn't break in the middle of combat, this might help me live a little longer.<p>As soon as I had my wind back, I headed straight back to Kelethin, and the Songweaver's Guild to talk to Sylia.  She was quite impressed with my story, and said that she had heard of some of these rogue creatures wandering about.  But she was even more impressed with my quick mastery of the Chant of Battle.  Smiling her encouragement, she announced to the entire Guild that I was a novice no longer, and that I was advanced to the second rank of the Guild!<p>Like I said, never the same twice around here.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat02.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat04.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
