I told Mother that it was time for me to join my elven brethren, packed my bag and left for Kelethin.  It was only a days walk from our village, but it seems so far now.  And Kelethin! It's almost too wonderful to describe!  Let me back up a little, perhaps explain a little.<p>My name is Talies.  I have no last name because I never knew my father.  He was a human, that I'm sure, because I'm only half-elven.  Mother refuses to tell me anything about him, so I'm hoping that eventually I will find him.  In the meantime, I've decided to do the only thing I ever really had any talent for: play music.  I'd long heard tales of the fabulous Bards from Kelethin, so that seemed the only logical choice.  Our village elder was kind enough to write me a letter of recommendation, which she told me to take to Sylia Windlehands in the Songweaver's Guild in Kelethin.<p>Now I'm here, and is it ever scary!  Kelethin is a city in the trees, and I don't mean just among them - I mean it's actually up in the trees themselves!  I had to take a lift up to the platform, where there were people running around, selling stuff and chatting like it was nothing special to be a hundred feet off the forest floor.  <p>Conquering my fears, I walked up to one of the local merchants and asked the way to the Songweaver's Guild.  He pointed me across a very long, very shaky looking rope bridge.  Steadying my courage, I very slowly, carefully made my way across the bridge.  About halfway across some elf running impossibly fast nearly ran me off the bridge.  As I turned to yell about his carelessness, he half turned, smiled an apology and raised his drumstick in a sort of salute!  He was a Bard!<p> Shaking my head, I made it the rest of the way across the bridge, and found myself on another platform.  Just across another short bridge, I saw the object of my quest: The Songweaver's Guild.  No fear this time, I strode across the bridge, opened the door, and stepped into my new life.<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat02.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
