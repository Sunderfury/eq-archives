    <td>Faction. No matter how you play, whether you are a roleplayer or powergamer, 
      factions play an integral role in your daily life in Norrath. Factions can 
      affect how NPCs react to you in a number of ways. Low factions with someone 
      can cause them to not do business with you, or even to attack you on sight. 
      On the other hand, having a high faction standing with someone will give 
      you their respect, protection and a discount when buying and selling. There 
      are many faction groups in Norrath, and finding which ones certain people 
      belong to and how to raise your standing with them can be quite a challenge. 
      And who knew that killing that gnome in Crushbone would make the Gem Choppers 
      hate you? I sure didn't! But I do now. And that, I'm assuming, is why you're 
      here; to find out whether killing that dark elf in East Freeport will make 
      all dark elves hate you, or just a select few. So, with that in mind, go 
      ahead and browse.<br>
