<P>We broke in on first wave thanks to our great
enchanters =) <BR>
Dunno about everybody else but thats first
time i've heard of anybody breaking in on
first attempt. <BR>
Special thanks to our 2 great enchanters
<FONT color="#ff0000">silvercat</FONT> and aleyta. <BR>
Thanks to furevar for doing some great pulling.
<BR>
We had some ups and downs, had some long
pauses and huge argument (hehe i'm sure everybody
will hear about tempestt ninja'in the verm
legs and nobody knew who looted draco, all
the people who were to check him died and
amys were in camp so we had to camp out and
nobody saw anybody loot) but it was a great
raid. Draco Loot-Shammy Staff, Gratz Frazen.
<BR>
Cazic Loot-Dawnfire, kravitz. Necklace of
necropotence, Gratz sator.<BR>
Was a great raid, thx for coming everybody,
<BR>
i finally got that blasted mace =) <BR>
LET THE FARMING BEGIN! <BR>

<P>私達が１WaveＢｒｅａｋをした際、LeaderがEqｖａｕｌｔにPostした内容。<BR>
数多くの賞賛のResもつき、成し遂げたという満足感でいっぱいになりました。<BR>
ただの自己満足といえばそれまでですが、”足跡”は残せたかと。</P>
