      <td colspan="2"><font face="Arial"><br>Well, Ill state what I have been able to read about and post the story here so that you can read it.<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>M'lady Xena had posted on our guild message board about seeing Judas one night, and she stated that he ran out of a bank to look for another fellow guildmember to give him this story. Listed below is the story and conversation:<BR> <BR>Xena, after reading your message, I set out to find Judas. Those of you who know Judas understand that he is indeed an adventurer and seldom can be found in town, except when he is selling his wares, mining, or reading in a library.<BR>He is unable to respond to the message board and doubt if he would ever say much anyway, because he is always digging in the dirt, or casting a line in some odd and far away place. This is the info I was able to gather from him:<BR>Cajun: Hail my brother how are you?<BR>Judas: Fair, tis good to see you, but I can sense that you are here for something more then a brotherly visit. <BR>Cajun: Aye, *feels sorry about not spending more time with Judas*, our Lady Xena said she saw you last night, and you were reading materials and drawing maps and you rushed out seeking Staniv Drannon.<BR>Judas:*Putting his head down* I never seek people much, you know that, but someone told me a tale that Staniv had talked about not long ago. As I heard the story, a bell rang in my head. Ive heard of this man Staniv is indeed looking for.......... <BR>Cajun:Well , Am I gonna have to kick it out of you....spill it man!!!<BR>Judas: What I have to share is not a complete story but some things I have heard , and some things I have seen with my own eyes.<BR>Cajun: *pours a drink for himself and Judas*, please tell me more.<BR>Judas: Long ago there was a man named Ziostes that had a daughter that went by the name of Ravena. I hear that she was indeed a lovely woman, and that warriors and merchants from all over the land wanted to win her hand . <BR>It got so bad that Ziostes, decided to place his daughter on an island, and keep her away from all men!! He gave her a cot to sleep on, placed beautiful flowers all around the land, and cool clear water for her to drink. He caste a spell on the water so that when she drank it, every cell in her body would revive and keep her young as long as she stayed on the island.<BR>Many years later there was a battle that was to be waged between two forces, and Im sorry that I cannot remember whom was involved in this battle to be, but whatever was the case the battle was to be fought at sea.<BR>One force heard about the mage Ziostes and his ability to move the wind and tides and thought that if they could pay him to sway the winds in tide in their favor they would indeed win the battle.<BR>Ziostes lived in a lighthouse northeast of Papua. Scouts were sent out to pay for his services. I hear that the Lighhouse, was very dark, and very old and only had one candle in its windows to guide ships, and that the very presence of the land made the mens skin crawl as they approached the door to ask Ziostes this deed. None the less they did apporoach him, and to their surprise and anger he declined their money. <BR>Well, when the men went back to Papua to tell there leaders about the rejection of their gold , surprise turned to anger. They started trying to figure out a way to make this mage do their deed. As they were grumbling about , a person heard their plight and informed them about the mages daughter. The key was to find his daughter.<BR>Now Ziostes had a liking for the fine ales of the land. It was known that he loved to get drunk, some say he drank to make himself feel better about the world around him, and others thought he was trying to get lost in his bitterness towards mankind and his daughter. When he would drink, sailors that sailed around the lighthouse would hear him rant and rave about things they could not understand. <BR>Well, a plan was conjured up to deliver some of the lands best ale to Ziostes and add some kind of drug to it to make him babble even more. I think the drug was Lotus, but I cant say for sure. <BR>The deed was done, and sure enough that evening after the mage had drank his fill, he began to sing , dance and babble. When at one time he began to cry and said: "Oh the small piece of land northwest of Skara Brae, you best be kind to my daughter or I'll burn you down, and you the water that protects her had best do your job, or I'll make you a desert".<BR>The men ran back to the inn in Papua and informed the leaders of things they had heard, and at once a fleet was set out to find Ravena. And there on an isle in the western sea, they found the young lass, and took her captive. <BR>When the soldiers of Papua informed Ziostes that they held his daughter in chains, and if he did not do as they said, she would be cut from ear to ear. Ziostes was angered greatly, but in his own way loved his daughter and wished for her to live.<BR>He did as they said and on the day of the battle, one sides battle front had no wind to fill their sails while the other side had full sails and where able to out manuever their foes. So that the battle would never be in doubt, the tide that day washed out to sea, leaving one group of boats running into the ground and rocks, as the other side fired arrows and rocks. The battle was fast, and the captures of Ravena won easily.<BR>When the battle was over, and the Captain of the ship that held Ravena sent men to unchain her so they could give her back to her father, they found a young lass that had aged 100 years, and was lying breathless in the hold.<BR>The men of Papua tried to pick the corpse up but it just turned to dust. So they gathered her remains and returned what was left of Ravena to her father. Ziostes was beyond himself!! He uttered these words: "Epulasomini Nepiasnom!!" then in a wild swirl of wind and water Ziostes spoke: " I am , Tritus, King of Air and Water, who collects all debts, and forgives no unpaid debtors! All those who are indebted to me shall pay the forfiet for their sins against me. From you I will collect salt from the Earth to return to my domain...... salt from anguished tears... salt equal to every bit of your flesh..!!"<BR>With that, all the men that were there that day turned to salt that flowed into the ocean. <BR>Now , to verify this story I have dug around the mountains of the lighthouse in the New Lands, and I have found many human bones, and have heard the ground moving below me. No one tells this tale much, perhaps because they want it to just go away. <BR>I will add one more thing that I have found. <BR>There is a rumor of a man that walks about the coast lines wearing a white robe. He goes by many names, and some call him Ziostes! He sings soft music to gain your attention, and once you look into his eyes you are never seen again. Some have seen strange piles of salt and bones along shorelines throughout the land. I myself have seen these things with my own eyes. Also I believe I have found the island that his daughter once</td>
