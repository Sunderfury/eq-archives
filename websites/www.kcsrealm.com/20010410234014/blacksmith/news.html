You are looking at the new home of K.C.'s Blacksmithing Guide!  Since I plan on expanding the site a little, I got the domain name www.kcsrealm.com, so I can do whatever I want with it.  Once I get all the links all straightened out, and once everything is perfect, i'll take down the old site.<BR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-2">2/16/2000</FONT><BR>
THIS SITE MAY MOVE!  I am looking to buy a domain, and should have everything working correctly in the next couple weeks.<BR>

I finally updated my page to show the banded gauntlets.  Even though I was telling people how to make them since October (news and messageboard), my actual banded guide did not have them in it.<BR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-2">11/27/99</FONT><BR>
I added 30 new books to my booklist by authors such as Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman, Katharine Kerr and Tad Williams.  I also put a frame up to make it eaiser to navigate. <A HREF="http://www.kcsrealm.com/booklist" TARGET="_BLANK">BOOKLIST</A><BR>
<P>


<FONT SIZE="-2">11/3/99</FONT><BR>
I added a bunch of J.R.R. Tolkien stuff to my booklist.  Check it out! <A HREF="http://www.kcsrealm.com/booklist">HERE!</A><BR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-2">11/1/99</FONT><BR>
I added Robert Jordan's Wheel of time to my booklist.  Check it out! <A HREF="http://www.kcsrealm.com/booklist">HERE!</A>  BTW I need a decent counter, the LinkExchange one won't work.  If you know of any good ones out there I can use please <A HREF="mailto:kc@kcsrealm.com.com?subject=counter">SUBMIT</A> them.<BR>

I know there are a lot of paladins who want to become smithes now.  If you have a lot of money to burn, and are in a hurry, check out this guide written by Fedaykin of The Rathe.  Check it out! <A HREF="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/speedsmith.html">Fedaykin's Guide to SpeedSmithing!</A><BR>

I am against crappy banner ads, but I need a way to make money to get a domain for this site.  I have finally come up with an idea.  Since I know most of you read fantasy books, I have decided to make a page called K.C.'s BookClub!  It has a lot of books on it, and if you want one, just click and buy from amazon.com.  I get credit for it and get 15%, and hopefully I will be able to get this site on its own domain soon!  Click <A HREF="http://www.kcsrealm.com/booklist">HERE</A> to see the books!<BR>
K.C.

It appears that gauntlet molds have been placed at all the armor shops, thanks to all of you who bitched at verant about it!<BR>
<P>

<B>BANDED GAUNTLETS FOUND!</B>  Ok it has been confirmed! Banded gauntlets have been found!! Thanks to Genadorn for posting it first! <BR>
<P>
Merchant Linolyen in Kelethin sells MEDIUM banded gauntlet molds.<BR>
<P>
Merchants at the entrance to Halas sell LARGE gauntlet molds.<BR>
<P>
There is a merchant at the entrance to An'knon that sells SMALL molds. Not sure of the name of the merchant yet.<BR>
<P>

These gauntlets require 2 sheets of metal (unconfirmed). They are probably as hard as cloaks, or harder. Just think IRL how hard a glove would be to make out of metal.<BR>
<P>

Happy Smithing!

I corrected the information on sewing kits.  They are trivial at 135, not 145.  The banded armor guide is coming along, should be up later this week.


<P>
<FONT SIZE="-2">10/16/99</FONT><BR>
I transcribed the new weapons book "Dirge of the FireForge", and put links in the blacksmith guide, as well as the weapons guide.  Put recipie for Sewing Kit (122-145).
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-2">10/15/99</FONT><BR>
