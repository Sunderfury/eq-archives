Near a defiant forge stood three,<BR>
Master smiths of great pedigree.<BR>
Engaged in a test of mettle and might,<BR>
they piled their craft till dead of night.<BR>
Their hammers rang, and sparks did fly,<BR>
till one grinned widely, his expression wry.<BR>
<P>
His skillful hand bore what was built,<BR>
from Honest Drink, and Mold of Hilt.<BR>
A Metal Sheet, and Spiked Ball Mold,<BR>
A Forged Morning Star to behold!<BR>
<P>
At the blazing forge stood two,<BR>
with bellows feeding flames of blue.<BR>
From within the heated air did rise,<BR>
the second blacksmith's joyous cries.<BR>
<P>
A Water Flask and Metal Sheet,<BR>
a Pommel Mold, and Hilt Mold meet.<BR>
Add a Mold for Heavy Steel Blades,<BR>
and a Forged Two Handed Sword is made.<BR>
<P>
Near the waning flame stood one,<BR>
with morning rise, his work near done.<BR>
As the coals turned faded gray,<BR>
his forged creation saw light of day.<BR>
<P>
His skill did show in completed task,<BR>
Mold of Pommel, Hilt, and a Water Flask.<BR>
A Mold for a strong Dual-Edged Blade,<BR>
make a Forged Bastard Sword suited for any raid.<BR>
