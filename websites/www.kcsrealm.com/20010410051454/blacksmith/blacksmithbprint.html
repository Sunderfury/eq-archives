<P>
Okay, I take it (due to the fact that you are reading this!) that you want to be a smithe.  
I have a lot of experience in this area, so I think I can help you out!!  
Just remember that this is only one of many ways to become a master smithe.
<p>
I am assuming that you are of good alignment and are around the area of Freeport.  
Freeport is the best area for a good alligned character to become a master smithe.  
There are many forges, and all the materials you could possibly need are in the city.  
So if you don't live in Freeport, MOVE!  
<p>
You need 3 elements to craft metal: Earth, Water, and Fire.  
The earth (ore) is mixed with fire (forge), and cooled with water.  

<p>
I reccomend that you choose a character with above average INT, and WIS, 
because INT determines how fast your skill improves.  
Since improving costs money, Higher INT = Less Cost.  
Wisdom determines your success/failure rate, so Higher WIS = Less Cost.  
This will be an issue once you become a master smithe, 
because you will be combing many plat worth of materials per attempt.
<p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>
So, here it goes!<p>
<p>
<OL>

<A NAME="training">

<LI>Move to Freeport!  It is the best place.  Trust me.<BR>
<P>
<LI>Train at your guildmaster till you reach a skill of 21.  
You will know when you reach this skill, because your guildmaster will tell you, 
"You must practice this skill in the field" when you try to practice.  
Which means you have to get your arse up and actually make something.<BR>
<P>
<LI>Buy the following books.  It is rumored that if you have these in your inventory when you 
make something, you will have better success.  This is a superstition.  But, they are good 
to have, and they list all the recipies.  If you have a printer, you can print them out.  
Here they are:<br>

<A NAME="bits">

<LI>METAL BITS<BR>
Now we can start smithing!!  Go to north Freeport, and find the smithe shop.  It's by the 
Bard Guild and is called "Groflah's Forge".  I suggest making things in big batches, it just makes it eaiser.  So, I will refer a lot 
to making a "Backpack" worth of ore.  Go in the smithe shop, and buy 80 peices of ore.  
Then buy 40 flasks of water from the inn in the marketplace.  *NOTE* Do not use foraged or summoned water.  
It won't work.  Just buy the regular water.  Now arrange your supplies in a backpack as shown:<BR>
<P>

</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
Now click and drag 2 peices of ore, and 1 flask of water into the forge as shown.  <FONT SIZE="+3"><B><U>Select 1 item at a time by holding down the CTRL key.</U></B></FONT><br>

<P>
<CENTER>The equasion for making metal bits is shown below.  You don't have to be a math wiz to get this!</CENTER>
<P>

<P>
*NOTE* You can't stack the ore in the forge.  They have to be in <U>SEPRATE</U> slots.<br>
<P>
Now click "COMBINE" on the forge.  You will get the phrase "The item is trivial for you to make." 
<BR>
<img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/trivial.jpg" alt="don't panic when you see this!" width="319" height="25"> 
<BR>
Don't panic, you arn't increasing your skill yet.  You are just making metal bits for later.  
Put the metal bits into the backpack as shown.<br>
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/backpack2.jpg" alt="should look like this" width="123" height="311">
</CENTER>
<P>
Now continue to turn the entire backpack full of ore into metal bits.  I know its boring, and your wrists will hurt, 
but who said smithing was easy?<BR>
<P>

<A NAME="scalar">

<LI>SCALARS<BR>
Now you are wondering, "What the hell is all these metal bits for?"  Well now is the time to use them.  
Depending on how many times you were successful at the bits, buy that amount of water.  
Now mosey on down to East Freeport.  There is a shop next to the armor by ithkar's that sells molds called "Trader's Holiday".  
The lady's name is Tislan I think.  You are looking for SCALAR molds.  Now buy as many SCALAR molds as you can carry.  
Now go to the forge.  There is one right next to the armor shop.  Now arange your inventory as shown.  
Have one space dedicated to water, and one space dedicated to metal bits as shown:<br>
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/inventory1.jpg" alt="arrange your inventory like this" width="98" height="194">
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
Now put the following items into the forge as shown.  1 Scalar mold, 1 metal bit, 1 flask of water.<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/forge2.jpg" alt="put things in forge like this" width="120" height="293">
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/metalbit.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="metal bit" width="49" height="48"> + <img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/mold.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="scalar mold" width="50" height="50"> + <img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/water.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="flask of water" width="48" height="48"> = <img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/mold.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="Large container mold" width="50" height="50"> + <img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/file.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="file" width="48" height="48"></CENTER>
<P>
Now here is something weird about everquest.  Click combine and you will see.  If you succeed, you will get a Large container mold and a file.  
If you fail, you will recieve a file.  Once your inventory fills up, go into the armor shop and sell all the large container molds and files.  
You will make more room for later, and you won't have to run to the store as much.  Keep doing this until you run out of scalar molds, then go buy more!!  
Do this till you run out of metal bits, then go make more!!  Fun, isn't it?!?!  When you get to a skill level of 41, 
scalars will become trivial.  Don't stress over it, just move on to the next step!<BR>
<P>

<A NAME="lantern">

<LI>LANTERNS<BR>
By now, you have figured out why 95% of smithes quit everquest.  Wrist injuries.  Anything that involves metal bits will hurt your wrist.  By time you are master smithe you will have forarms of steel.  Now we will make lanterns.  Make a couple backpacks worth of metal bits if you haven't done so already.  Go to a tavern and pick up some bottles.  Put a stack of bottles in your main inventory.  It should look similar to this:<BR>
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/inventory2.jpg" ALT="inventory should look like this" width="96" height="194">
</CENTER>
<P>
Now go to east freeport and buy some lantern molds from Trader's Holiday.  Put 1 metal bit, 1 flask of water, 1 lantern mold, and 1 bottle into the forge as shown:
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/forge3.jpg" alt"forge should look like this" width="119" height="293">
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/metalbit.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="metal bit" width="49" height="48"> + <img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/mold.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="Lantern mold" width="50" height="50"> + <img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/water.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="flask of water" width="48" height="48"> + <img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/bottle.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="bottle" width="48" height="48"> = <img src="http://www.kcsrealm.com/blacksmith/images/lantern.jpg" border="0" align="middle" alt="Large lantern" width="46" height="47"></CENTER>
<P>
Lanterns are better to make because instead of 3 items turning into 2 items (scalars), you have 4 items turning into 1 item.  This means you don't have to run to the store as much to sell.  Lanterns sell for a couple gold apeice, which is pretty good.  Going from 41 to 68 should be a breeze.  Once you become trivial at lanterns (68), move on to the next step.
<P>

<A NAME="skewer">

<LI>SKEWERS<BR>
You are almost an average smithe!!  You can make metal bits with ease, and you can actually make some money making metal studs for tailors.  You can even try banded right now if you wanted to, but I would advise against it.  Making banded increases your skill very slowly, and it is very expensive.  And since I am one cheap bastard, I always do what is cheapest.  So, lets make some SKEWERS!!  These are made the same way everything else is made.  1 metal bit, 1 skewer mold, and one flask of water.  These will take your skill from 68 to 115.<br>
<p>
Put the items into the forge as shown.  Click COMBINE.

<P>
Skewers take you through being an average smithe to a master smithe.  Since this time in your smithing career is the longest, expect a lot of failures in the beginning.  They really take a long time to master.  But you will be up in your chair as you reach 99, then 100, then 101.......WHOOHOO!!!  I AM A MASTER SMITHE!!  Now you can see on your skill list MASTER under smithing.  And you can put the tag "Master Smithe" in all your newsgroup posts.  Go ahead, pat yourself on the back.  You earned it!<BR>
<P>
Once Skewers become trivial (115), move to the next step.<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="pots">
<LI>POTS<BR>
Don't you love being a master smithe?  I know I do!  But you have 2 choices now, to make banded, or to still play around with those damned metal bits.  I am going to show you how to make something else to bring up your skill to 122 first.  This stage is way easy, I spent around 5-10pp on this stage.  The recipie for pots is 1 water, 1 metal bit, 1 pot mold, and 1 standing legs mold.  Molds are found at Trader's Holiday as usual.<BR>
<P>
Put items into the forge as shown.  Click COMBINE.

<P>
This stage goes by so fast, you will hardly remember it.  After you are done with this, you can make 2 peice items with ease, and 3 peice items are pretty easy as well.
<P>
<A NAME="sewing">
<LI>SEWING KITS<BR>
Ahh, the next step.  The needle and thimble molds are found at Spoolie Gee's in North Ro.<BR>
<P>
This item requires 1 water flask, 1 metal bit, 1 needle mold, and 1 thimble mold.
<p>
Place the items into the forge as shown.  Click COMBINE.<BR>

<P>

This item becomes trivial at 135.<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="135+">
Once you are trivial at sewing kits, the only way to increase your skill, is to make banded cloaks and mantles.  Those will take you to 168.
