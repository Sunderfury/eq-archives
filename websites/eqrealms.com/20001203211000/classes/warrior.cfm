<B>Starting Out: Character Creation</B><BR>
The big question burning in most minds when they go to explore a class in EQ is, what race should I choose?  Overall
my first answer to most people is to just have fun with it, the Warrior is a fun class and it's not always extremely vital 
what you choose, choose a race you'll have fun playing.  However, if you are obsessed with stats, please do read on.<BR><BR>

<I>STR & STA Warrior</I>: Many folks who choose to play a Warrior want high STR and STA.  STR will give you a higher max damage as well as 
a better average on how much damage you deal out, it also determines how much of a load you can carry around. STA adds extra HP, it also helps you 
keep on truckin through the long haul.  Massive battles can get you tired fast.  For a Warrior heavy in STR and STA the best choice you can make is that of an Ogre or Troll.  Keep in 
mind as either of these races you will be hated by many areas and find it harder to get around, but you'll have the 
best STR & STA of any other race of Warrior.  Trolls have less STR & STA, but have a natural bonus, they can regenerate health 
faster than other races.  Now if the travel hassle is a big issue to you, or you just don't want to be evil, consider the Barbarian or 
the Dwarf.  The Barbarian has higher STR and STA than a Dwarf, however Dwarves start with a very good base of DEX which has 
a big part in how often you weapons proc or how often you get critical hits.<BR><BR>

<I>Speedy Warriors</I>:  For some people, dealing more damage just isn't as important as avoiding more damage and 
taking less punches.  These people tend to choose speedy Warriors.  The races in this category include Gnomes, Halflings, 
Half Elves, and Wood Elves.  Deciding which one to choose may be entirely up to wether you put more value into AGI or DEX, DEX will help your 
weapons to proc more often and your critical hits to happen more often, AGI is said to help you avoid damage or take less damage.  (Also a bonus to your
AC which effects the damage you take)  But I personally would make the decision based entirely upon how short you want to be.<BR><BR>

<I>Somewhere in the middle</I>:  If you simply can't decide which stats are important to you as a warrior, you may want to choose to go with 
a Human or a Dark Elven warrior.  They seem to be pretty mediocre all the way around.  However, as a Dark Elf you can enjoy high INT which 
will help you solve those math problems while they pop into your head during combat.<BR><BR>

<B>Begin the Carnage (Timeline)</B><BR>
Ok, so you just started a Warrior and you wonder which skills are going to be important to start off with?  You'll want to 
put a point in taunt so you can get that skill off to a good start, also put 1 point in kick to 
get it started quicker.  You'll want to map your taunt and kick keys for easy access during battle.  Wether you choose a 1H or 2H weapon 
to start off with is entirely up to you.  One thing that's important to know is that you won't do much more than 20 damage
with a 2H weapon until you hit level 20, those twinked Warriors with Executioners Axes are not really effective at all.  A nice 
1H weapon is a good choice to start out as a Warrior, and a shield for added protection if you can afford it.<BR><BR>

Around level 5 you'll get bind wound, it's good to start that skill up so you can atleast have a tiny bit of self healing abilities, as you 
get higher up in level you'll really start to notice it takes a LONG time to gain back those HPs. At level 6 Dodge will need to be trained in, that'll
help you avoid some damage, and Bash will be trainable as well.  Bash won't be nearly as useful to you as a Warrior compared to 
Paladins and Shadowknights, the best weapons are either 2H or you dual wield so you won't even use a shield which is required for bash.<BR><BR>

At level 13, hang up that shield and get yourself another nice reliable 1H weapon for your second hand.  Put a point into the dual wield 
skill to get it to start up, even more points if you want to boost it but it will go up nice and quickly.  If it appears not to work, 
that's because it really does stink at level 13, around about level 15 you'll notice it's benefits and start to see it work.  Also at level 15 you'll 
gain the Double Attack skill, slap a point into that one for sure, in the next few levels you'll see your potential for dealing out multiple attacks 
really gets a lot better.<BR><BR>

At level 20 you may want to hang up those dual blades or trade them in for a very effective 2H weapon, no longer are you stuck at dealing around
20 damage or less with the high damage 2H weapons.  You can now use the weapons that will dish out more than 40 damage, the question of course 
is can you afford them?  A good idea might be to try and get a Langseax of the Wolves by questing for it or buying one, that quest is listed below in the 
<A HREF="#quests">Warrior Quests</A> section.  Of course, do not neglect your 1H skill or your dual wield skill, always revert back to it and try to keep it capped 
as well if you can.  1H Weapons will once again rival the almighty 2H later on in your levels.<BR><BR>

At later levels you'll really start to notice just how much the Warrior relies on grouping, soloing will become very hard, or if you can solo a creature you'll be 
sitting for 30 minutes to gain all of your health back before you can fight again.  Many people quit playing the Warrior class during the 20s as they start to 
notice this, if you consider yourself a loner it will happen to you as well, don't say I didn't warn you.  However, if you have lots of friends and 
you still enjoy being the damage soaker, this is the class for you and you will be needed!  Who else is going to take those double hit attacks of 
100/100 damage or more?  At level 25 you'll gain Riposte and will want to train in that, it's basically a counter attack that happens 
about as often as Parry.  At 35, your last skill, Disarm is totally useless just about.  The mobs can do so much damage 
with just their fists that disarming them may not even help much, but hell, it's fun!  In your mid 30s you'll notice that 1H weapons start to max out 
with more damage, 20+ damage with a 7 base-dmg weapon?  Yes it's possible.<BR><BR>

<B>Know Your Role as a Warrior</B><BR>
Your role in a group situation as a Warrior is to absord damage, because no other class can take the punches like the
Warrior can.  It's your job to put yourself right out in front of everyone and get the snot beat out of you, because those 
casters and even the other fighting classes can't take that damage as well as you can.  As a Warrior you are often the last person 
to retreat from the battle, knowing quick ways out of dungeons can come in handy especially when you have very little 
health left.  Even at higher levels you will be surprised at some of the great escapes you can pull off without biting the 
dust.<BR><BR>

As a class with high HP, you may also be expected to be the puller, the person in the group who goes out looking for 
trouble and brings it back.  For this, your Archery skill is very important, you can't pull with magic like a Hybrid fighter
can.  It's also vital to know your whereabouts, as a caster of course there are spells like gate the provide a quick escape, but 
as a Warrior there are many times when only your two legs will get you out of trouble.  Knowing escape routes, and also 
knowing good places to pull come in handy for safe grouping.<BR><BR>

<B>Some Final Tips</B><BR>
A major issue I see with lots of new Warriors, or twinks, is that they don't understand the value of AC.  AC is, without a doubt, 
the most important stat for the Warrior class.  If I could dump bonus points into it during character creation all 25 of them 
would go into AC.  Remember your role, it's to absorb damage.  How are you going to stay alive longer and be a more 
effective tank?  Have high AC so that you take less damage and avoid damage.  A Warrior decked out in Mithril may have higher STR
and Magic Resist, but lacks in AC compared to the Warrior in full Crafted.  Once again when you ask the question of what your role is in combat, AC
is always going to be the most important stat.<BR><BR>

Finally, something fun that some people don't know about or use often is the Egg-Shaped Pumice.  I love them, basically 
it's an item you can buy with 5 charges of Nullify Magic, great for a Warrior in duels or in combat with mobs.  They tend to cost 
around 20pp or so, and can be bought by an NPC in most towns.  Pesky damage shields can be cancelled, or lets say you are 
pulling and you get rooted.  Without that pumice to cancel your root and continue moving along you'd probably end up dead before 
the group could find you.<BR><BR>

<B>1H Slashing (Level 1)</B><BR>
1H Slashing is the staple weapon skill of any Warrior and is vital to your ability to fight, 1H Slashing skill is also 
vital to dual wielding 1H Slash weapons after level 13.  1H Slashing gains a damage bonus around about the time the 
skill reaches 150.<BR><BR>
<B>2H Slashing (Level 1)</B><BR>
2H Slashing is a vital skill to any Warrior, both 1H and 2H slashing are equally as important.  While 1H slashing will be effective 
at levels 13 to 20 when you first pick up Dual Wield, 2H slashing gains a great damage bonus that comes into play at level 20.  Many Warriors 
say 2H Slashing will deal out the most damage up until about level 40.<BR><BR>
<B>1H & 2H Blunt, Piercing (Level 1)</B><BR>
How much time you spend on these weapon skills is entirely up to you, 1H and 2H slash will always be important, but in 
the future new weapons which can be used by warriors may use these skills.  It's good to be up on all your weapon skills if you have time.<BR><BR>
<B>Archery (Level 1)</B><BR>
Archery is an important skill as it's really the only way a Warrior can effectively pull targets from distance.  Get yourself a fast bow, and stock up 
on cheap arrows whenever you run out.<BR><BR>
<B>Kick (Level 1)</B><BR>
Kick is basically a chance for a Warrior to get in some extra damage, it's a must to use during combat.<BR><BR>
<B>Taunt (Level 1)</B><BR>
Taunt is used to catch the attention of a mob and get it to attack you instead of weaker casters, it's a vital skill for grouping and you should 
taunt as often as possible during battle to keep it maxxed.<BR><BR>
<B>Throwing (Level 1)</B><BR>
Throwing isn't exactly as effective as Archery for dealing damage and attacking from long ranges, however if you have the time 
to keep throwing skill up, it never hurts to be good at multiple weapon skills.<BR><BR>
<B>Bind Wound (Level 5)</B><BR>
Used to bandage up your wounds, you must have bandages to use it.  You can buy bandages or have them summoned by a Magician.  Warriors can only bind up to 50% of their health, but in times when healers aren't available knowing bind wound helps you
heal up faster.<BR><BR>
<B>Bash (Level 6)</B><BR>
This is shield bashing, a Warrior with a shield equipped can bash a mob.  Bashing inflicts damage much like a kick, 
but can also interrupt casters or stun enemies.  However, since a warrior can inflict so much more damage with a 
2H weapon or dual wielding (which means you can't equip a shield), bash isn't very useful for the Warrior class.<BR><BR>
<B>Dodge (Level 6)</B><BR>
This is a chance to save against an attack.<BR><BR>
<B>Parry (Level 10)</B><BR>
Basically another chance to save against an attack.<BR><BR>
<B>Dual Wield (Level 13)</B><BR>
Dual Wield allows 2 1H weapons to be held at the same time.  It can allow multiple attacks, and will get better as you 
gain levels.<BR><BR>
<B>Double Attack (Level 15)</B><BR>
Double Attack is a chance at a second attack, and of course as you gain levels and gain skill points it gets more effective,
with Dual Wield and double attack you can expect to hit as many as 4 times in one round in higher levels.<BR><BR>
<B>Riposte (Level 25)</B><BR>
Another chance to avoid damage, however Riposte allow you a counter attack swing!<BR><BR>
<B>Disarm (Level 35)</B><BR>
Notice how baddies inflict more damage when they have a weapon equipped?  With the disarm skill you can attempt to 
take those hostile weapons out of their hands.  Weapons fall on the ground and can be picked up, in a PvP situation a weapon
goes into the players inventory slots. (not yours you greedy punk, the player you disarmed!)<BR><BR>
