True Heroes in Norrath

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-2"> - <I>01:59 PM<!-- Timestamp, like this - 2:47pm --></I></FONT><BR>
<blockquote>
Well I am pleased to say that here is some truly GOOD news.  Glad to see there are some people who DO give a damn :).
<br><br><blockquote><i>
There has been much to-do about kill stealers, EQ Fraud, dishonest and
disreputable people in Everquest.  It even seems that there has been a
preoccupation with these anti-social people.  Well, this note is to let everyone
know that there ARE decent folks in EQ.  Below is my story:
<br><br>
I and my guild were in Lower Guk in the Bedroom.  We were 3 30's, 2 29's and a
28 (me)...now, we might be a little undersized there, but, we do very well
together because we play together all the time and we play well together.
However, the one time we don't do well and have to evac is when the Greater Ice
Bones get trained down the hallway to the Bedroom on the way to the zone...we
can do one, but more than that is death to everyone.
<br><br>
We were there and doing very well....when someone shouted "Train to zone" well,
right after that, before we could start the evac, there appeared 5 players with
big Gargoyles and several Greater Ice Bones on them.  Upon seeing us in the
Bedroom, those five players stopped their running, stood and FENDED OFF THE
TRAIN UNTIL OUR EVAC WENT OFF.
<br><br>
Upon our return to the Bedroom, which took awhile because Lylani's evac takes us
to E.Karana, then group tele to W.Commons, we found 4 of those 5 heroes awaiting
the fifth because SHE HAD DIED IN OUR DEFENSE.
<br><br>
The names of these people were (unfortunately, I did not get last names):
<br>
<br>     Mynarthitep
<br>     Barrd
<br>     Lindara
<br>     DavisPrime
<br>     Pulgrey
<br><Br>
And they represent the guild The New Outriders.  If these people are
representative of the type of folks in that guild, then they have a group of
exceptional folks.  I, Myron Trueheart, Lylani Sylvermoon (my wife), Saorn, Tlua
Truheart (no relation), Roothless Entoothless, and Conceited Ennarragant, owe
these people a specific debt of gratitude.  And, as Guildleader of The Chosen
Few, I pledge our support and aid to The New Outriders.

Innoruuk Drunken Race in Kelethin (Updated)

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp; - &nbsp;<I>01:42 PM<!-- Timestamp, like this - 2:47pm --></I></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An update on the Kelethin Drunken race event:
<UL><i>
The Knights Hospitaller, a guild on the Innoruuk server, is proud to present
their first event, the Kelethin Race of Drunken Fools.  This event, one we hope
to make into a prominent and permanent part of the Innoruuk server, will first
take place this Sunday, noon PST (GMT - 8 hours).  The course has been set;
start will be at Faydark's Champions will proceed to the Scouts of Tunare. 
Members of the guild will be on hand for guidance to the start and a
walkthrough of the course prior to the race and intoxication.  Two races will
be held; a newbie race will be run first for those level 5 and under, with 
prizes for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.  Entrance for this race is free, no buffs,
spells, or bard songs may be used, and the alcohol will be provided.  The 
second race will be open to all comers.  Entry fee for the second race is 5pp
per racer; prizes will be awarded to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place racers. 
Anyone in the open race may not use any spells or bard songs other than Spirit
of the Wolf and Selo' Accelerando.  The alcohol will be provided for this race,
also.  Binds at the so-called PoD lift will be performed free of charge to all 
participants and is REQUIRED.<BR><BR>  

In the event of death, you are NOT eliminated from the race; you respawn then
at the PoD lift (hence the required binding) and are to reintoxicate yourself
before proceeding.  An official will be on hand to witness the reintoxication. 
The winnerand top two runners-up will be those whole are the first to hail the
designated official standing outside the Scouts of Tunare.<BR><BR>

All those wishing to race are encouraged to show up prior to the scheduled time
to allow our casters ample time to bind and debuff (to ensure no one has
inappropriate buffs).<BR><BR>

I would also like to provide this word of warning about the open race; we will 
not take responsiblity for lost XP due to death by falling from the platforms. 
I have personally tested the course multiple times while intoxicated, and the
level which will be required will not make the race impossible to complete. 
However, the ever-present danger of misstepping will be present, and thus
appropriate warning was deemed necessary.<BR><BR>

So, if you are wanting brush up on yout abilities to use the alcohol and walk,
or merely want to watch your friends fall from the trees, come to Kelethin this
Sunday for the races.  If you have any questions, please direct them to the
race coordinator, Gehnenna, at <a href="mailto:mps2019@tntech.edu">mps2019@tntech.edu</a>.<BR><BR>

Trade Window Problems

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-2">&nbsp; - &nbsp;<I>11:47 AM<!-- Timestamp, like this - 2:47pm --></I></FONT><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Myron Trueheart, Guildleader of The Chosen Few, has mailed us a story of a trade bug discovered.  I have never heard of this happening before, so take note and beware!
<UL><I>
I had my Enchanter/Jeweler, Tyrantula, out last night making and selling
jewellry.  I sold a Silver Fire Emerald ring to a young lady.  I had also
sold/traded a Silver Ruby Veil to a fellow for some plat and a Silver Fire Ruby
Veil.  Both showed up at the same time and I began the trade with the young lady
first by placing the ring on her character.  The trade window opened as usual,
and she placed her money in the window.  Right after that, somehow, the fellow's
star ruby veil and money appeared in the window (the plat was added to her's),
and the name on the trade window changed to HIS name.  When I saw this happen, I
cancelled the trade.  Well, I got the ring back, he got his veil and money back,
but, she didn't get her money back.  He said that he didn't get her money, I
didn't get her money, and she said that her money was gone and she was very
irate about it (140 plat to level 13 charcter is a lot of cash).  Well, I gave
her the ring, and wrote it off and then petitioned.  She and I waited for about
30 mins, but got no response.  It was after midnight (east coast) so I had to
log with no resolution.<BR><BR>

I don't know where the platinum went, the fellow may very well have gotten it.
However, the very fact that somone can intervene in a 'secure' trade is very
disturbing.
