<B>So you are thinking about being a shaman?</B><BR>
If you want to beat things up play a tank type, shaman aren't good at that. Admittedly the best of the casters but still far more a caster. Most shaman I know think they are tanks and just embarrass me by making fools of themselves and making a bad name for us. 
If you want to heal people don't play a shaman. Clerics are far better than shaman at that and more sought after and Druids are about equal
If you want to make a fight easier for a group, don't play a shaman. Enchanters are better at that, far better.
If you want to kill things with magic quickly, don't play a shaman. Wizards, Magicians and Druids are all better at that. This is another thing that I see shaman trying to do all the time in a group and this is what most people playing other classes hate most. This is worse than embarrassing, it's down right suicidal.
If you want a pet, don't play a shaman. Necromancers and Magicians are much better than yours, and even Enchanters get theirs them at a much earlier level.<BR><BR> 

<B>What are shaman good for then?</B><BR>
Shaman are best at four things, and they aren't what people usually expect: Shaman are equal to the best DOTer - Necromancers. In fact we get the same dots they do, some of them at a slightly higher level though, and we are better than druids at this (try telling this to a druid though). We get a dot that does over 1000 points of damage for 300 mana at 49th lv. We get the best magic resistance debuffs in the game, and we get the smaller ones earlier than magicians, USE THEM. I personally have killed red creatures at 35th level that druids and necromancers five levels higher cower before by using these spells. We get combat buffs that increase our friendly tanks effectiveness earlier and better than other classes, there is some dispute on the effectiveness of these however. Lastly we are a jack of all trades and can fill in a party that is missing a cleric, or caster, or tank (each of these gets less and less effective the higher level you are with the possible exception of caster). Sometimes I have had to fill two of these positions, not a good idea but it is possible. Most people you will run into will think of you as a buffer and backup healer. This is a good use for us, but may not reach our full potential.<BR><BR> 
O.K. now that for some reason you have decided that a shaman is the class for you, maybe because, like me, you are an insane battle-mad wacko who thinks they can do everything. Lets talk about creating one.<BR><BR> 
Only three races exist that can be shaman at this time, Barbarians, Trolls and Ogres. I am a barbarian, because I wanted to be good, but many a time I regret that decision and wished I'd been a Troll. 
Barbarians make good shaman because they have the highest starting wisdom and much higher charisma and are good, so you don't get killed in every city you go to, also they have the best starting zone in the game - Everfrost. 
Trolls make good shaman because they regenerate, they have a lower starting wisdom than Ogres though. Regeneration will probably make more difference once you get to 24th level and get cannibalize, which lets you convert hit points to mana at a 2 to 1 ratio. Anything that reduces downtime is worth more than stats. 
Ogres don't make good shaman, but there aren't many ogre shaman out there so if you want to be one go for it. Ogres get a much higher Strength than Trolls or Barbarians, but this won't matter much due to your strength spells, Some have told me that Ogres regenerate but I have not tested it yet. If they do they would be better than trolls because of their slightly higher wisdom.<BR><BR> 

<I>Wisdom</I> - Put all the points you can into this. This is the most important stat for Shaman.<BR><BR> 
<I>Charisma</I> - The hidden downfall of Trolls and Ogres. Charisma seems to affect how well debuffs such as Malise, Fever, Drowsy, and Disempowerment are resisted. I recommend putting any extra points into this. Always use Charisma buffs on yourself when planning to use any of debuffs or buy or sell things. These may be useful for Bards and Enchanters in your party too, but ask on enchanters first.<BR><BR> 
<I>Intelligence</I> - This is the downfall of all shaman. You will learn skills very slowly, even your skills at casting spells. I have spent hours and hours just practicing my spells to get the skills maxed out. You will also be very poor at trade skills and spend far more money learning them than other races that have some intelligence. I don't recommend putting points into this, but if you want to be a good alchemist you will want to collect intelligence items to use while practicing.<BR><BR> 
<I>Agility</I> - Can affect how often you are hit. This can be the difference between getting a spell off and not when in hand to hand combat. If you are an ogre you may want to put 5 points into this to take care of the large penalty for having under 75 points in it. Or just keep up your Agi buffs. Agi buffs are good to put up on your whole party as it will help everyone from being hit, Agi is the first buff to put up, only rangers have access to agi buffs but there's will allways be much less powerful than yours. Agi buffs will also help for encumberance.<BR><BR> 
<I>Strength</I> - Affects how likely you are to do closer to maximum damage with a weapon. Shaman all have high strengths to begin with and strength buffs, there is no reason to put any points in this or bother with Strength items ever. Put up on mele types after Agi, check that druids / enchanters / others don't have better ones first. Only put up on casters if they ask for it for encumberance purposes. I always have this up just incase I feel like beating on a creature, besides it's fun comparing your strength to a human warrior and saying you have more.<BR><BR> 
<I>Stamina</I> - Affects hit points and fatigue. The effect on hit points is not great, all shaman start with high stamina to begin with, so no reason to put any points here or get stamina items. Stamina buffs will increase hit points by a slight ammount (it saved me more than once in my younger years) so it is good to cast on party members if you've done all other buffs and have mana to spare, or if you have someone who is constantly getting fatigued.<BR><BR> 
<I>Dexterity</I> - Affects the likelihood of a weapon to produce an effect - unless you plan on using a screaming mace your entire career (the only weapon that can be used by shaman that has effects) there is no reason to put any points here, buy dex items or even use your dex buffs on yourself. Only cast on meleers, check that they have a weapon that procs first before bothering. Usually I cast this with Strength so that I don't have to keep it up on myself to tell when it wears off. There is still some speculation that this stat affects Monks hit percentages and ranged combat (bows, thrown weapons) so you may still want to cast it in these situations. It may affect success in trade skills too, so it won't hurt to cast it before trying to make something.<BR><BR> 

<B>Tricks of the Trade, or how to make your enemies cry uncle.</B><BR> 
Up to about level 20 you can fight hand to hand with some effectiveness. About that of a ranger with one hand tied behind his back. After that you are probably better off staying away from the fights and meditating instead of fighting. If you are soloing or with a party with no tanks you can substitute with some serious backup for a tank. There are a few exceptions to this rule, which is if you are fighting casters, your slam will make you useful in combat by letting you stun and interrupt casting, especially if there are no large race tanks in your group The other time is if you are fighting lots of low blues or greens, you will hit often enough to make it worthwhile, and not spend large amounts of mana on the small stuff. There are many shaman out there who still engage in HTH combat regularly after 20th level, I think they are idiots, but to each his own.<BR><BR>
 
If you do plan on engaging in HTH combat which is a good idea before level 20, spend everything you can on AC items even over wisdom or mana, it will make a large difference in battle. I would suggest using a two handed weapon to take advantage of your strength, also the longer delay will let you cast spells between swings thereby loosing less time when casting. With a good AC I was often able to time my spells to my swings instead of my opponents and do full damage with my weapon while occasionally getting a spell off. Another trick I learned is that if it is fairly safe to let creatures run, or you have a runner and no mana, turn your auto-attack off, when you have recovered from your last swing and you are close to the runner, turn it on then off again immediately. This will net you many more hits and many less too far away messages. Make a hot key for melee attack, slam, "/assist" "/loc" and "/yell" no matter what class you play you should be using these. Use /assist by selecting someone then saying /assist you will automattically start attacking whoever that person is attacking. This will make your combat much more effective since you will be able to kill one mob more quickly, thinning the damage your party takes. /loc will give you a location, even if you don't know how to interpret it, alternate between this and /yell if you are about to die, you may get help if it is near and if not you have a location that someone can show you to.<BR><BR> 

<B>Spell Specific Strategy:</B><BR> 
<I>Buffing:</I> See the Stats above for Stat Buff Specifics. buffing may be of minimal effectiveness, with the exception of speed and hit point buffs, there may be better ways to spend your mana. On the other hand it doesn't hurt you unless you are out of mana for that gate to get out, and it will make you more loved by the tanks at least, and you could get through life as a shaman never doing a direct point of damage (at least after 5th when people will actually group) all the way up to 50th. Buffing is most important when trying to break a spawn, as it will give your party an edge, getting them to wait untill they all have full buffs can be difficult. When buffing in order of importance are SOW (always have memorized if outdoors), Quickness (tanks only, last buff up), Endure (only when applicable, sometimes only on puller), Direct HP, AC (self and Monk, Warrior, Rouge), Agility, Strength (tanks only, possibly self), Dexterity (tanks with weapons that proc only, also helps crit hit chances), Stamina (only if you have the mana to burn). To be most efficient this requires that you know what is in your party so you aren't casting quickness on enchanters, etc. There are three ways to time your buffs: #1 You don't time your buffs, make em beg! Only the worst shaman do this, some people won't ask no matter how badly they want it, some people will drive you nuts continually telling you their buff has worn off and when are you going to cast it again when you are out of mana. It won't get you invited back, but this is definitely the most mana efficient way. #2 Self timed round robin buffs. Cast one or more buffs on yourself, then cast on everyone else that should be getting them, when they run out you recast. This has the drawback that you may be using more mana than could be by casting useless things on yourself like dexterity. Some of the buffs you cast will have the same time on them so you can use one as a trigger, for instance if you are at a level that agi and str last the same you can put up agi on yourself and everyone, then immediately cast str on the tanks, and follow this pattern when agi runs out. This is the least mana efficient way, as if you or someone goes LD or has a Cancel Magic cast on them or dies you will need to overlap you buffs to get back in sync (or leave them buffless which will make them mad), there have been days when I was never able to get fully in sync with someone and ended up spending almost twice the mana I should have had to the entire time. #3 Use a timer. If you did this with each of your buffs you would need to find out the duration of each buff at your level (some seem to change based on your level), and have as many as 8 timers going keeping track of your buffs. I've never met anyone with the patience and ability to concentrate this requires. It can be useful in a limited fashion, for example when you first get quickness it will drain you more than anything else to cast it on yourself in addition to tanks, so if you time it alone you can keep it up constantly without spending the extra on yourself. This is also much more reasonable when casting debuffs as who want to cast a sicken on themselves so they can time it on their opponents. I use mostly method #2, with method #1 when low on mana. Lastly as a rule of thumb, do not go below half of your mana buffing, save it for emergencies, especially if you are the designated healer.<BR><BR> 
<I>Inner Fire:</I> I lied, Shaman are the best healers in the game. At least until 24th level when Clerics get Greater Heal. With the 1st level spell Inner Fire you can heal 20 hp for 10 mana. This is as mana efficient as Greater Heal, our best healing spell. Inner Fire has two drawbacks, one it's slow casting - I still recommend using it in combat if you aren't soloing instead of your other healing spells until 19th when you get Healing and to keep it memorized for after combat healing until 29th Level. The second drawback is that it won't stack with other casters shield spells, and you can't overwrite a higher lv shaman's inner fire. The hard part: getting others to not cast shield spells on themselves or others. First off when some kindly cleric or druid comes along and casts a shield spell on me I scream like a stuck pig! I then explain not to ever ever ever do that to shaman, because I can't cast my healing over it, and I'm stuck with it for half an hour! and never do it in a group with a shaman. Second when in a group ask everyone to remove their shield spells so you can heal them. It is near impossible to get them to do this, but it can be done and they will see the effectiveness when you heal the whole party from near death, and a few seconds later say Full Mana. Do not try to use this spell when soloing except as an after combat heal as it will get interupted 9 out of 10 times due to it's speed. Other sheild spells: Scale Skin - if I remember correctly it does stack with Inner Fire so it is a good spell until you get Turtle Skin, I never found the trouble of getting the scales worth the effort though. After scale skin always keep your shield spells up on you if you think you might be hit. You may want to buff Warriors, Rouges and Monks with your shield spell, but don't bother with any classes that can cast any spells, they will all already have personal shields up if they want them. I would place them in importance after Strength and Agility.<BR><BR> 
<I>Healing:</I> The faster version of Inner Fire. Don't bother with Minor Healing, you are better off with Inner Fire. Once you get Lesser Healing use it for emergency combat healing only, memorize healing whenever you are in a group, even with 5 other healers (not that I've ever had that happen) you never know when you'll be needed to heal someone quickly. When you get Healing you will probably find that the smaller amount of Inner Fire makes this a better option for most healing, but dig out Inner Fire for low mana situations. Once you get Greater Healing use that always, and you can finally retire Inner Fire. It is also a good idea to hotkey a heal for faster access when you need it (select your injured and hit the # for the hot key instead of dragging the mouse all the way back to your healing spell) this will only save a second or two, but it could be that second or two that saves your party.<BR><BR> 
<I>DD (direct damage, burst of flame, frost rift etc.):</I> these are useful when used correctly - use them when soloing and you need to kill something quick, or killing something quick is better than waiting and having more mana. Use in a party where dots are not appropriate or the battles are too short for them to be effective, only use them when you are full on mana and all other duties have been fulfilled. Use burst of flame to pull with until you get drowsy. Using these on runners near death in dungeons is also a good idea, as using root will usually take too long if they are already running, and they will be out of range. Using these will usually irritate others in your party who know shaman's DD's are not very good, and your mana can usually be used for other things more effectively. I usually like to have one memorized anyway as a DD at the right time can save your party.<BR><BR> 
<I>Flash of Light:</I> this can be obtained at cleric guilds, it can be an effective short term low mana debuff. It can also be used to make your enemy run around aimlessly when they are out of mele range. This spell is far more effective in duels where your opponent can't see anything at all including his own spells to cast them.<BR><BR> 
<I>Drowsy:</I> this slows your opponents down. Always cast this to pull when you intend to fight hand to hand. You will be able to cast spells between your opponents strikes much easier, and they will do less damage to you because they strike less. I've seen this make an enormous difference in a battle. I still use this at 35th level, it is very cheap in mana cost and it is easy to cast on all mobs attacking the party, it will not break an enchanter's mez. The other spells in this line are useful too but usually more so when fighting one or two tougher creatures as opposed to a large group, and if you are using the more advanced ones I would recommend Malise first as they seem to be resisted much more.<BR><BR> 
<I>Dots in General:</I> One of the areas you excel at as a shaman. Only Necromancers rival you, but they have no debuffs so yours can be more effective (don't let the necro find out!). The hard part: Druids are a equal at healing and worse at doting. Convincing them of this is impossible - I've tried and tried. What should happen is when you are grouped with a druid is she should heal while you dot. The time this isn't true is when DD is needed, she is much better at it than you. WARNING: do not cast dots when grouped with an enchanter, it will mess up their mesmerizing and charming no end, and thereby you and your party. If you and the enchanter have already worked out that they will be stunning and not mesmerizing beforehand then you can use them, I've never run across an enchanter who does this, but it could be an effective tactic with a shaman to dot all the mobs.<BR><BR> 
<I>Disease DOTs:</I> Sicken is a very under utilized spell, the mana efficiency on these disease dots is amazing. This is the only way to go if you are killing things that con better than you. Sicken itself is not great, but it will prevent a creature from gaining any hp back for a couple of minutes. Do not underestimate these spells in long fights, they will do as much damage as two wizards if you have the time, these are what I have used to kill red cons, use a disease resist debuff beforehand and you will be able to kill red cons too. I have never had occasion to cast them in a party as they take too long, and the only creatures that have lasted long enough for them to be effective resist them almost all the time, this seems to be changing as fights get longer at higher levels.<BR><BR> 
<I>Poison DOTs:</I> These are the bread and butter of damage for Shaman. Often times there is enough time to get a poison dot off and see it's end while in a party and always when soloing. While not as efficient as the Diseases they don't require a separate debuff (malise works on everything except disease) and they chew through hit points about 4 times as fast. Again you can stack all your different dots for some serious damage.<BR><BR> 
<I>Root:</I> Most people use this in dungeons to stop runners, it is not effective at this, but can be effective to prevent runners (not to stop once they've already started running). You must cast this spell before the creatures start running and as close as possible before they do. As an example if you are fighting a green mob who you expect to run at about 40 % of their health, cast it when they are down to 50 %. Do not ever cast it as the first thing you do or they will surely break the root and run at some point. Don't use this if you have a druid, ranger, necromancer or shadowknight who can slow runners down, their way is much more effective, and your spell slot can be used for other things. There are three other ways I have found to use root and it's advanced versions which most people don't know. Root kiting: you can use root to stop creatures in their tracks after you have laid a dot or two on them, this will give you an opportunity to meditate and it will cause them more damage than if they were running around. I have found you spend about the same amount of mana doing this as running things around but it takes less time, and can give you a breather. This works best with creatures that make a lot of noise if you are under 35th level so that you can hear when they break out and come after you. I have also noticed that casting your dots after rooting tends to break the root, less so with disease dots as they do less initial damage. Crowd control rooting: This is much more difficult and I have found that even if your party knows what you are doing they may not work with it effectively. If you have no enchanter to do crowd control you can pull a creature out of the crowd attacking your party and root it far away from them, go back and continue meditating. Dots and malise are good for frenzying a mob, although just healing your party members can have the same effect. It can also be used similar to the lull harmony line. Just cast it on one of the creatures you are going to fight to pull and it will stay there for awhile while you beat on it's buddies. Obviously this doesn't work too well on casters and healers as they will continue to cast. The higher level roots are more effective at the last two root strategies as they last longer. Lastly a root can be used to stop a creature from frenzying on someone, root seems to mess with creatures agro list, and makes them seem to change targets somewhat randomly until it wears off, also if people leave it's melee range the creature can't follow it so it attacks someone else.<BR><BR> 
<I>Sow:</I> ah what people think of when they think of shaman. O.k. maybe they think of druids, but shaman are the masters getting it 5 levels earlier. You can make a fortune for 9th level casting just this spell for donations. What is it you ask? Spirit of the Wolf - this is the first spell you should get at 9th lv. It makes you run faster, and that means you can outrun enemies gaining time to cast on them or time to get away. This means victory or running away to fight another day for your party. Keep this up on your party at all times, it is more important than any other buff. I don't care if you are sitting in dagnor's cauldron camping orcs that you think you don't need to run away from, and that it will do more damage if you do run. Keep it up at all times you are not in an inside dungeon. Many is the time I thought it safe to let down and paid the price for, or worse one of my party paid the price. Recast immediately before entering a dungeon. It can be effective to actually leave dungeons to cast this on you and your party at times.<BR><BR> 
<I>Endure/Resist:</I> these can be life savers when used at the right time and a big drain on your mana at the wrong time. Endure Magic is the most important, always keep this up on your party if you are fighting anything that can root or snare or charm, that means ALL humanoid casters. Admittedly I've never seen a kobold shaman root, so that may not be an issue with them, but it will still help everyone avoid their other spells. If your party has another caster who can endure magic on everyone, you may want to try to convince them to keep it up if you are being stretched too thin (I've personally never seen another caster do this to everyone, but maybe that's because they leave it to the shaman) The other ones are of limited use, in the right situations can help, but more often than not a cancel magic or cure disease at the right time is better. For instance fighting fire elementals you would think a resist fire would be great, but a cancel magic will get rid of their fire shield for everyone at the cost of one spell instead of 6 that reduce it's fire shield damage by maybe one or two. On the other hand if you are fighting drakes you can be sure they will breath on the party and you can prevent allot of damage by having endure fire up. If fighting something that causes disease or poisons the appropriate endure can not just prevent a few points of damage but be much more mana efficient than heals & cures. This is only efficient when you are specifically going after a creature that does this, say going after snakes & spiders for venom for your rouge buddy, not when wandering around a zone killling all the blues that cross your path.<BR><BR> 
<I>Disempower:</I> These useless unless you are dueling, if you are dueling they will cripple tanks, the high level ones will even cripple mages through encumberance (if you can get them to stick) sure they lower your opponent's AC and Strength, on NPCs this will have almost no noticeable effect. You would be better off doing almost anything else with your mana, yes even DD. The only other possible uses I can think of for this is at high levels to help power level youngsters.<BR><BR> 
<I>Malise:</I> The ultimate debuff, the higher lv ones only get better. This will lower the all the resistances of a creature, great if you are having trouble getting things to stick, or others in your party are. If with an enchanter you can use this after they tashan to lower resistances to ridiculous lows. Also this will not disturb a mesmerized creature, so you can safely cast this on them. At lower levels this is really only useful on high yellows & reds, or if you are grouped with lower level casters. A trick at higher levels it to do a stage Malise, start off with Malise as a cheap debuff then toss off a Malisement or Malisoi, of course with an enchanter around their Tashan almost always sticks so you can wait for them to do that first. As an example of how effective this spell is, it allows me to do full damage with my DD 3 out of 4 times against Yellow guards at 35th, whereas without it I am lucky to do full damage even once and usually get full resists at least 1 out of 4 times.<BR><BR> 
<I>Canabalize:</I> oh Yeah! Faster mana, your own personal form of clarity. Once you get this and regeneration never let regeneration fall unless you are sitting on a boat (Hate Boats, Hate Boats, Kill the Boats!) and can't cast. This opens up endless possibilities, and this is the point that Trolls will outshine Barbarians and Ogres. I have managed to kill myself with it once, so be careful. To get the full effect when medding wait for your mana "tick" to go up stand up immediately, sit back down and repeat, this works best at level 35 plus when you can just sit down to meditate. I have used this for such things as pulling a last heal out of nowhere to save the party's tank, getting mana for a gate, etc. If you can't figure out what to do with it and aren't constantly using it, you need to go back to kindergarten. If you can get a bard to sit around using an instrument and healing (before they get manasong) you can get amazing amounts of mana this way. I was able to buff an entire party with everything under the sun doing this, it may possibly be even better than their manasong. Also useful for sucking some extra mana off of the healers in the party. When you get greater heal you can trade back and forth between hitpoints and mana as both are a 2 hp to 1 mana ratio, to put yourself wherever you want on both. ( you can do this with inner fire, but the mana lost from the casting time vs. meditating won't be worth it.)<BR><BR> 
<I>Regenerate:</I> always keep this up on yourself, It's been rated to give somewhere between 400 to 650 hp for 100 mana. Canabalize and this means you get as much as 325 mana for 100! This is also a good way to augment healing, the warriors are down a few and constantly in a fight? Cast this on them. Or if you aren't grouped with any other healers and you've got down time between fights, cast this instead of healing. If you are grouped with other healers they will probably heal your regenerating people, even if they aren't the main healer.<BR><BR> 
<I>Quickness:</I> Cast this on your melers, and always keep it up, this is more important than any of the other buffs, possibly even more important than all the other buffs combined. Because of it's short duration cast it last on melers before battle or even at the beginning of battle. If you have a timer use it, there is some indication that the spell duration is longer at higher levels, so you may want to re time it when you level. The only time not to cast it is if your melers have an EXE axe as it's haste will overwrite it, or if you are grouped with an enchanter, their version is better.<BR><BR> 
<I>Befriend Animal:</I> The one and only charm spell you ever get. By the time you get to this level there's not an awful lot that isn't green and can be charmed, Griffs and Mamoths are about it. If you want to go griff or mamoth hunting by yourself this can be can be used very effectively. Find one, cast Malise, then Befriend, find another then set them on each other, help if yours is loosing, cast Invisibility after it kills the other one to break the charm, then finish it off. You won't get as much xp on the first one that dies, but you'll get full on the next, and for only a pittance in mana. I've been meaning to try Griffons against Giants, but can never seem to find Giants around when I've got a Griff, they must know and not even enter the area. I've also charmed gorillas in Cazic and heard it can be very effective against Sonic Bats in Sol B too, but haven't tried. See companion spirit on how to use your pet once you have one. Note that a befriended animal near your level (preferably blue) will be able to deal out much more damage, and take a lot more than a summoned pet, but are also much more dangerous to try to control. Also note that no spells you cast on a charmed pet will have any effect while they are charmed.<BR><BR> 
<I>Companion Spirit:</I> Gets you a pet wolf. This can be a great boon and a major pain. As you've just played 34 levels without one you won't know how to use it (unless you've been playing another pet class, or been using befriend) First thing you need to do when you decide you want to start using a pet is go solo and practice with it so you won't kill all your buddies, and if you are outside, you will be relatively safe from pet caused trains. Hotkey "/pet back off" and "/pet attack" These are the two most important things you can say to your pet, followed by "/pet guard here" to get it to stay in one spot (/pet sit down doesn't work too well), "/pet no taunt" when planning to kite "/pet get lost" when you want to get rid of it. If you are a serious perfectionist you can cast your pet and if not satisfied it is your best say "/pet get lost" and cast it again, I only recommend this when you are sure you will be in one place for a long time. "/pet who leader" will cause your pet to respond, letting you know if you are in command range - which you should never get out of. Hitting F1 twice will select your pet Kiting: when planning to kite say "/pet no taunt" and cast only Strength and SoW and Quickness on your pet, you can leave the strength and quickness off if you are in a real hurry, but you should always SoW your pet when possible, it will let them keep right on anything you are kiting. Your pet will be a better dot than anything else you can cast, so it is definitely worth getting when kiting. Make sure you don't leave maximum spell range when kiting or the mob will turn on your pet, and not continue to follow. If you do need to leave maximum spell range for some reason (say recasting regen on yourself) use "/pet back off" to get your pet to come back to you beforehand. If you plan on going toe to toe with something treat your pet as you would any other tank as far as buffs go. If in a dungeon your pet becomes your main focus, as you will need to control it completely at all times to prevent it from creating a train to come after you.. Because of this I recommend against summoning one (or even more so if you are befriending one) if you are the main healer, as it will be very difficult to do both at the same time. I also recommend strongly against summoning a pet if you have an enchanter messing as when a mob attacks you your pet will continue attacking it, breaking any mesmerize that she casts on the mob attacking you. Use /assist on your main tank then "/pet attack" to make sure your pet is attacking the same thing, you may want to do this often as your pet has a mind of it's own and may start attacking anything else that has hit it or you instead. If anything starts to run immediately use "/pet back off" many mobs will decide to turn around and come back or stay just out of agro range when it is running, if your pet is right on it though it will keep running and collect all it's buddies along the way, who will probably kill your pet and come back for you. If all the tanks run after the mob then you can do a /pet attack, but you will need to follow to keep an eye on it, making sure it doesn't do anything stupid, and come back the way you want it to. Often it is better to just have it back off an wait for the tanks to come back or toss a DD to finish off the Mob, as your pet is stupid and will take paths that will collect bigger trains than someone who knows their way around. If something has frenzied (won't leave it alone even for other people closer) on your pet it is often times better to "/pet get lost" you pet then won't leave it alone either and as your Snarer most likely will not have that Mob snared, and if it does get the better of the mob there goes the mob and the pet to bring a train back. I suggest reading other classes guides on how to use pets too. Using your pets poorly will get you trained, killed, and hated more than anything else you can possibly do, with this in mind I implore you not to even try it in a party where there might be any danger until you have practiced for some time. Finding a dungeons with all greens and playing with your pet while by yourself is the best way to try it out, be sure to have Gate memorized!<BR><BR>
