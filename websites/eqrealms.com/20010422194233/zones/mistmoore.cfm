<B>Level Range</B>: 20-50<BR><BR>

<B>Why Come to Mistmoore?</B><BR>
Simple!  Mistmoore is one of the best places before the planes for loot in the entire game, there are many sought after
items here that even 50th level folks still wish to obtain.  Mistmoore can also be a gold mine for experience.  So why 
is Mistmoore seldom crowded like Guk or SolB?  That's the other side of the story, Mistmoore can also be one of the 
most dangerous places and cause loads of agony and experience loss in train after train of powerful mobs.  Some call 
it Castle Trainmore, the name seems to fit.  Not only can trains be caused by conventional means (players being stupid), 
but also because of many bugs with pathing.  However, the loot is worth it!  If you want something in Castle Mistmoore, 
read on.<BR><BR>

<B>The First Stages</B><BR>
As you first Enter Mistmoore and head down the ramp area near the Entrance you'll see a tower to your right and a pond 
in front of you.  The tower can not be accessed from that point.  This area is a good spot for those who are around 20th 
level, full groups mind you, you won't get very far trying to solo here.  There are some low level casters and some melee 
mobs in this area, as well as some Gargoyles who can be a bit higher up in the 20s who spawn at the base of the tower.  This 
area is a bad spot to catch a huge train if one should come up, the best place to be is up on the ledge to your very far 
left above the pond, mobs will tend to walk on a path between the pond and the base of the tower to go back.  You don't want to have 
runners and you don't want to begin more fights when you hear a train is on the way, it's best to play it safe and invis 
while you wait for the smoke to clear.  In this area one rare spawn may pop if you are lucky, the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=76">Glyphed Ghoul</A>, who 
spawns near the pond.  If you are really lucky he may even have the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/equipment/armor_display.cfm?id=317">Crested Mistmoore Shield</A>.<BR><BR>

<B>The Canyon</B><BR>
The Canyon is the path that leads towards the Graveyard Area and the entrance to the Castle itself.  The Canyon is 
full of mobs, some are a little bit higher up than the ones found in the first pond area.  Many groups pull from the Canyon 
into the pond area to keep a constant flow of mobs for their group to fight.  The Canyon is also obviously a bottleneck and
the train-tracks run right through it, beware!<BR><BR>

<B>The Graveyard</B><BR>
The Graveyard (or GY) is to your right when you get to the end of the Canyon, you will see a big gate and gravestones inside. 
In the Graveyard things heat up a bit and groups here are usually average around 25th level.  Some healers and 
other casters can spawn, healers (Custodians) can be a huge pain if you don't have a caster to nuke them before they heal or a way 
to interrupt them.  The Graveyard also sports the first nastey train bug, a wandering Glyphed that you should avoid 
killing at all costs, if you do it can send a huge train from the Castle.  It wanders strait down the path of the Graveyard
to the crypt and then back out.  There are mobs to fight on both sides of the path near the gravestones, and some near the back 
of the area by the side of the Crypt.  Behind the crypt we have <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=53">Ssynthi</A>, your friendly neighborhood Shadowed Caster.  Ssnythi 
won't be aggresive, and you should not kill it unless you want to take the big faction hit for the Temple of Solusek Ro.  Ssynthi 
does however drop the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/equipment/armor_display.cfm?id=325">Robe of the Keeper</A>.<BR><BR>

Inside the Crypt we basically have nothing to worry about, just pit traps, they are on either side of the coffin.  On top 
of the coffin is a flower (looks like a bag).  You can pick it up and hand it to Ssynthi for a Temple of Solusek Ro faction upping. It won't 
work if they are already apprehensive.  Rare spawn here in the Graveyard is an <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=58">Imp Familiar</A>, like most Imps he's 
really tough and nastey, but not horrible compared to other mobs in the Graveyard.  If he spawns it will be on the 
gravestones to the left of the path as you enter the Graveyard.  In the back of the Graveyard you'll find the secret door to the Jail.  The wall you can walk through is in the very back corner behind 
the crypt, you'll have to walk thru another to enter the Jail.  A wandering mob which can sometimes be the Avenging 
Caitliff will wander out past this entrance sometimes and can be pulled from there, however be warned they are a bit 
higher level than mobs in the Graveyard.  More about Caitliff in the next section.<BR><BR>

<B>The Jail</B><BR>
The Jail can be recognized by the fact that it's a small room with 4 doors, the door immediately across from you as you 
enter is the only one that works when triggered.  It will open all 4 doors, exposing the mobs who are inside the cells.  This 
is yet another bug, the mobs here are stuck, in most cases they can't move.  They can all be casters however, which 
means they can easily blast away when you enter the jail.  The level of mobs here is above that of the Graveyard, stuff here 
can be around 30th.  There are 2 more invisible walls in the Jail, one on each side of the door that opens all four doors.  The 
one on the back of the wall leads to the area that you will fall in if you fall through the pit trap in the Crypt in the GY.  The
other secret invisible wall leads you to a stairwell which connects to a hall that can get you access directly to the Castle 
or the Tower. (tower seen in first area of MM)  The Castle rooms to the left of the stairs, tower access to the right.<BR><BR>

If you are grouping in the jail you may want to pull mobs down the stairwell while fighting there, there's one that wanders 
up and down and another 2 near the top (which you can usually get 1 at a time).  The wandering mob can be the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=37">Avenging Caitiff</A>, 
who drops the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/equipment/armor_display.cfm?id=84">Crested Spaulders</A> and <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/equipment/armor_display.cfm?id=7">Crested Helm</A>, also gives the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/quests/quests_display.cfm?id=3">Electrum Bladed Wakizashi Quest</A>.  The wandering mob is 
his placeholder, takes 30 minutes to respawn.  One quick note, if you find yourself in trouble in the Jail sometimes the 
best escape route is up the stairwell and take a right toward the tower, there's a bridge to the tower that you can jump off 
of which will inflict 100 some damage but if you can spare it you'll escape as the mobs won't be able to follow.<BR><BR>

<B>The Tower</B><BR>
The Tower is full of 3 or 4 mobs, usually nastey casters.  It's also the home of the ultra rare <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=60">Garton Viswin</A> who drops 
the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/equipment/weapons_display.cfm?id=130">Glowing Iron Pike</A> or the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/equipment/armor_display.cfm?id=168">Chestplate of Dark Flame</A>.  Garton casts necro spells and is said to be 37th level, he's quite a 
battle to put up with if he actually does show up.<BR><BR>

<B>The Courtyard and Pit</B><BR>
Back over to the end of the Canyon we go, back where we were at a fork with a choice to enter the GY or the tunnel to the 
left.  The tunnel to the left leads to the Castle's Courtyard and front gate.  The tunnel is usually empty and should be a safe
spot to stop for a second.  The Courtyard (CY) is full of mobs around 30th level, can be casters or melee.  You'll notice a 
path leading up, this leads to a bridge which leads you to the gates of the heart of the castle.  Also if you go down in the CY 
instead of up the path there's a pit leading down with more mobs to fight, and a Dark Elf NPC named <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=49">Enynti</A> who is 
guarded by two Gargoyles.  She drops a quest item for an Enchanter Quest.  Mobs in the CY are seldom hard to get alone, 
it can be good to have crowd control or harmony pulls.<BR><BR>

<B>The Castle (Front Areas)</B><BR>
The Castle is laden with lots of mobs, some over 35th level.  They consist of Dark Elves, Gypsies, Gargoyles, 
and Vampires.  I musn't forget the Werewolf as well! As you enter you have a choice to enter the first or second floor, 
there is an entrance through the middle and also stairs on either side.  If you enter through the middle you'll proceed into a
hallway and there are basically 3 ways you can go.  You can go through either of the 2 immediate passages to your left 
or right to enter the ballroom.  Important bard items are found in the ball room on the Gypsies, also the Talon for the 
Warrior Crafted Breastplate is found near here (on a mob of course). Back to our hallway though, you can go all the way down to your 
left to a door to enter the Ambassador Room, I'm not sure what's important about this area.  Or if you go all the way
right in that hallway there's another door at this end which leads to a room that has doorways to enter the Garden.  Futher back 
past the Ball room and Ambassador Room to your right is the hallway with the Entrance to the Kitchen and beyond that 
the quarters of Maid Issis and Butler Syncall.<BR><BR>

<B>The Kitchen Area</B><BR>
Getting here while invis can be tricky, in most cases I cut through the ball room and open the double doors in the back, 
then I hand a left and walk all the way down and enter the hallway that attaches to the kitchen.  You can cut through 
the Ambassador Room but that scares the hell out of me because too many mobs are close to you.  What's cooking in the 
kitchen?  You if you don't be careful!  In the Kitchen spawn 2 <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=29">Ancille Cooks</A>, shadowknights with harm touch of course, 
it's important if you are storming the Kitchen to have a tank walk in first.  All the mobs back in this area average around 
35th level.  Ancille Cooks drop cauldrons for Paladin quests, I think Shadow Knight quests too.  One other mob spawns 
in the Kitchen with them, it can be a caster or melee mob.<BR><BR>

Beyond the door to the Kitchen there is 1 short hall that branches off, and one short hall that continues.  Continue forward
and that door is the door to <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=59">Butler Syncall</A>'s room.  Take the turn and that door is the door to <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=62">Maid Issis</A>' room.  Both these
mobs have placeholders often and always spawn with 1 gargoyle in the room. There are also 3 mobs that spawn in the hallways
outside, 1 in front of each door and 1 at the intersection of hallways.  If you need fangs for the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/quests/quests_display.cfm?id=3">Wakizashi Quest</A>, or a 
<A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/equipment/armor_display.cfm?id=324">Nightshade Wreath</A>, perhaps a <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/equipment/armor_display.cfm?id=323">Cape of Midnight Mist</A>, this area is where you will be.  Beware of those thin walls it's 
often hard not to make big pulls at first, after initial clearing you have it in the bag!  Don't pull the mobs in the hallway past 
the Kitchen door unless you want the Kitchen to come after you as well.<BR><BR>

<B>The Garden</B><BR>
Back at the entrance to the castle where you went through the middle instead of choosing to go up the stairs.  Remember 
I mentioned if you go all the way down to the right there is a door that leads to a room with a piano that has other doors 
which lead to the garden.  What's important in the Garden?  The <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=95">Hemo Enologist</A> drops blood spirit for the Rogue Burning Rapier 
quest.  Also to the very back of the Garden there is a small opening to another outdoor room with a fountain, this is the 
place where the <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=24">Cloaked Dhampyre</A> spawns.  He's quite rare.  Mobs out here can be 30th to 35th, pulls from the Garden can be 
very hard without getting lots of them.<BR><BR>

<B>The Pool Room</B><BR>
The final important spot I'd care to explain about is the Pool room, which is the only place I haven't camped (atleast 
not yet!) so I'll be short and sweet about this one. The pool room is on floor 2, if you went up the stairs and kept 
left you'd come to a room with a pool in the middle of it.  That's the trick really, if you go upstairs you have a lot of 
rooms to get through, but if you go through the Jail area (attached to GY) and up the stairs and take a right you 
might find it a bit easier.  The great "Tower Suicide Jump Escape" is also available to you if you need it.  You go through 
2 doors, down some stairs, and take a right to get to the bath, it's behind a secret walkthru wall.<BR><BR>

What's important here?  <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=65">Xicotl</A>!  He's a 40th level Shadowknight that drops the hilt for the Paladin Soulfire Quest, I don't even 
need to say that his Harm Touch is, em, nastey!  His placeholders are the little baby <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=57">MM guards</A>, the lowest level mobs 
in the entire zone.  Silly, aint it?  <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/beasts/beast_display.cfm?id=61">Lasna Cheroon</A> is also in this vicinity, <A HREF="http://www.eqrealms.com/equipment/armor_display.cfm?id=321">Diamondine Earrings</A> baby!  She's a 35th level 
Vampire.<BR><BR>

<B>That's all folks!</B><BR>
What about the other room upstairs?  Princess Cherista?  Well don't bother going to kill her unless it's just a pride issue, 
there's really nothing she has anymore or value these days.  On a final note, as you can see Castle Trainmore has a lot 
of very nice things for those who work hard at getting them, I urge you to drag your friends down there and get them killed!  I
do it all the time with mine!<BR><BR>
