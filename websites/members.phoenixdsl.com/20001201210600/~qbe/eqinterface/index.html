Here's the current Interface we're all familiar with...
<br><br>
<img src=newinterface.jpg><br><br>
Here's what it could be.<br><br>
</CENTER> I propose this interface be enabled/disabled sort of like "Advanced Interface ON/OFF", so newbies aren't too overloaded with information, or if you just need to see HP and don't care about the rest.
<br><br>Changes to the original interface are as follows:<br><br>
Since no one ever uses it, remove the "Effects" button (this belongs in the general options menu area anyway)
<br><br>
Reduce the "Main", "Abilities" and "Socials" buttons into 1 button that scrolls through them all (ever notice how Main and Combat both take you to the same page?  It's a waste to have all these redundant buttons)
<br><br>
The "current target" words have been removed from above the target box.
<br><br>
Group member's mana is displayed along with HP
<br><br>
Each group member's buffs are displayed in a 7x2 grid (allowing for all 14 buffs possible).  Reasons for this are several, including:
<UL>
<ui>Now you know when your buffs have worn off someone
<br><br>
<ui>It's more obvious when someone is poisoned or dotted during heated battles where the battle messages move by very quickly
<br><br>
<ui>When dotted/poisoned badly, you don't need to waste precious time typing that you have been dotted/poisoned as everyone can see it happen
<br><br>
<ui>EB is wearing off when someone's AFK... we've all seen this happen.  See the icon flash on them and take care of it for them.  Same for levitate.
<br><br>
<ui>Spend less time typing requests for buffs and mana checks and more time playing the game!
<br><br>
<ui>Puller for a group is constantly well informed as to groups ability to take on mobs, and can make better pulling decisions more quickly.
<br><br>
<ui>Bards can see who's fallen out of their song range even if they're not looking right at them
<br><br>
</UL>
Not able to be pictured, but RIGHT-clicking on a group member should automatically /ASSIST them.
