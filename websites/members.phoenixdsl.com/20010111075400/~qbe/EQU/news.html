			My ISP is being bought out.  I'm not sure what's going to end up happening, or what effect it will have on EQu (i.e. patching), since the data is stored on my personal web space provided by my current ISP.
			<br>
			<br>
			Phoenix Networks is still my ISP, for now.  Something called MegaPath Networks purchased accounts from Phoenix Networks, apparently including mine.  BUT - MegaPath only wants to handle "business" DSL accounts, and they don't wanna do home / residential users such as me.  So, the residential accuonts they acquired from Phoenix Networks have been sold to yet a 3rd ISP, Telocity.
			<br>
			<br>
			Right now, EQu is coded to look for files on members.phoenixdsl.com, and I dunno if that's going to change, how long the files will still be available IF it changes, if this web page will be available for a time or what is going on.  My account will be transferred to Telocity effective December 30, 2000 at which point we shall see what's goin on.
			<br>
			<br>
			EQu will resume it's operations on it's new home... wherever and whenever that may be I don't know.
