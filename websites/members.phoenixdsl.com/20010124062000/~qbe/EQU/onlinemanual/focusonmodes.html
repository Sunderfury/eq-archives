	When editing text colors, EQu gives you the option of speficially focusing on battle related messages.
	<br>
	<br>
	EQu will enter a special editing mode where only battle related texts are avaialbe to edit, and the sample areas are fully populated with repetitive battle texts, so that you can get a better feel for how your battle related texts will look in-game.
