			EQuServerStatus.exe was updated to 1.0.8.  It now uses the abbreviated server status request code 0xFFFF0500.  The option to reduce the size of the form to display only the servers was also implemented.

			Greetings once again my friends, it has been a while since this page was updated!
			<br>
			<br>
			EQu Server Status will be updated sometime today.  It is being patched to comply with the new server status data format.  This is a mandatory change, as the data format EQu was previously using to bring you server status will no longer be valid Friday the 9th of this month.  Hopefully this will go smoothly and you won't notice a thing.

			The EQu Log Parser is undergoing a re-vamp at this time, and what I have in development is a little faster than what is currently available.  For example:  Parsing my character's 40MB file on "high detail" takes upwards of 17 - 21 minutes to parse with the currently available version of the log parser.  The development version is currently parsing this file, in high detail, in 14 <b>seconds</b>.  This is a much more acceptable rate of processing, and gives a lot of "headroom" to allow the parser to be extremely detailed without taking forever.
