	EQu gives you the option of reverting to the default EverQuest colors, be it for one specific color or for your entire color scheme.
	<br>
	<br>
	To revert a specific color back to either the most previously saved value for that color, the current EverQuest default color, or the "old school" EverQuest default color (EverQuest's text colors when the game was publicly released) right-click on the desired text option or sample line of text and select the appropriate option from the PopUp menu.
	<br>
	<br>
	To revert ALL of the text colors to either current or old school defaults, select the corresponding option from the "Revert" menu.
	<br>
	<br>
	<I>Note: to revert an entire scheme to last previous save, simply re-open the file without saving</I>
