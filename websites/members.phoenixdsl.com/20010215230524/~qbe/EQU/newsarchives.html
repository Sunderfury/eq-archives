			On an extended holiday break from most forms of thinking which, surprisingly, includes EQu.  Spending the time hanging out with the wife's relatives (oo, fun) and collecting Etherial Mist armor for my cleric (even funner). 
			<br>
			<br>
			Have a nice xmas or your cultural equivalent =)

			Day old news, but news to me that I found to be interesting.  Weren't we all just a little suspicious when 3Dfx decided to cut off all video card manufacturers, bought STB and tried channel all their product through one vendor at an inflated price?  It just didn't seem kosher to me.  Well, <a href="http://www.3dfx.com/">here they are today</a>.

			I'd like to remind everyone of the new message board.  If you're having problems running EQu, if you have questions, comments or suggestions, it's a great place to get help or voice your opinions.  Use that 'Boards' link over on the left to get there.

			EQu.exe was updated to 4.1.7.  It now shuts down all other EQu programs before initiating the patcher.
			<br>
			<br>
			EQuPatcher.exe was updated to 1.2.3.  It now waits for all EQu processes to leave memory before it downloads files.
			<br>
			<br>
			EQuLogParser.exe was updated to 1.0.6.  Opening files now filters for files eqlog_*.txt, and file names that are at least 17 letters long.

			There is now an EQu message board.  There wasn't exactly a demand for this, but while I'm kinda sick with the flu it was something I could do that didn't require a lot of my brain power to set up, and it was kinda fun. = P  The link is over on the left in the nav bar.

			EQuPatcher.exe was updated to 1.2.2.  This just includes some more detailed error reporting so I can better figure out the now officially elusive 380 error.  If you can't patch due to this error, have EQu generate an email for you when the error occurs by hitting the "Report this error!" button.  As some of you already know, sending in this email will generate an auto-response email to you that contains a link to latest version of EQuPatcher.exe.  This way, you can save the latest version of EQuPatcher.exe directly to your EQu folder, which will update your patcher to the latest version.  If you still encounter errors while trying to patch, the email generated by EQuPatcher version 1.2.2 (and up) will contain the improved error reporting data which should assist greatly in discovering the source of the error.
			<br>
			<br>
			The patcher WILL work again... eventually.  /sigh

			The auto-response email to error 380 while patching has been changed to a link to the file, instead of including the file itself.  I noticed many people reported the error multiple times last night, and probably received about half a meg's worth of the same file over and over as a result of the auto-responder.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you receive an auto-response to your error submission of 380 while patching, click the link or copy it into your browser to obtain the new patcher you need, saving it to your EQu folder.
		</UL>
		<br>
		<B>3:30am MST</B>
		<UL>
			<br>
			If you submit (or did submit) an error report for Invalid property 380 that occurred while patching, you will receive a response email that contains a new patcher program (it's about 92kb in size).  This new version of the patcher, 1.2.1, fixed the error on the machine here that was producing this error.  Please locate and save the EQuPatcher.exe file contained within the email you receive and save it to your EQu folder.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you never received error 380 while patching, you can simply run the patcher to update to EQuPatcher 1.2.1.
			<br>
			<br>
			And might I say, having problems with the patcher is ugly business I would like to avoid in the future.  Ack.

			Something has happened to the patcher which affects at least half of you.  It occurs on one of the 3 test machines I have here.  I do not know what it is at this time, but it renders EQu un-patchable when it occurs.  I apologize for this, it will be fixed as soon as the problem is discovered.  It will most likely require that you download a new patcher seperately, but we shall see.

			If EQu is suggesting you patch over and over and over, please run the Pic Viewer.  When the Pic Viewer notifies EQu of it's version, this should stop the loop.  I forgot to have the patcher assign the new version, but this will be fixed.
			<br>
			<br>
			Also it seems that tons of ya are getting error 380 when you run the patcher.  Not sure what's causing it yet, I'll check it out.

			EQuEditor.exe was updated to 1.0.6.  The dynamic lighting option was added to the defaults.
			<br>
			<br>
			EQuPatcher.exe was updated to 1.1.9 to check for newer versions of the EQuPicViewer program.
			<br>
			<br>

			A new little thing called the EQu Pic Viewer is now available via patch.  The old Launcher button has been replaced, but this does not mean the Launcher project will never come to pass.  That button just midas well be doing something useful while it sits there.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Pic Viewer is a simple little guy, it just lets you interate thru the .bmp files in your everquest directory and delete the ones you don't want.  If you're like me, you end up with a ton of screens that are just junk, or you might want to know exactly what pic #125 is without going through the trouble of loading photoshop, etc.  Eventually the Pic Viewer will let you do cooler stuff, but for now it's just a little browsing tool.

			I'm still a little unsure as to how I'm going to redesign the UI layout area.  With the coming of Velious, the UI has changed quite a bit - with the inclusion of inventory and main windows, 2 new high-res settings and the /wincolor command, there's a lot of new stuff to consider.  For me, I think the best way to do this would be to study up on all things graphical in VB, and try to come up with something a bit more functional than what existed before.  What I have envisioned at this time is an in-game simulator, one for each desired resolution, a full-screen mode where you can drag your windows about similarly to how you do it in-game.  This would be a lot more accurate than the scaled-down versions of before, and a lot easier to see and use.  I'm not sure if this is possible to do, but usually when I have that doubt, it ends up being possible :)  But as always, we shall see.
			<br>
			<br>
			I would really love to get that log parser completed, as it's been sitting on the back burner for quite some time (too long).  The new change to spell casting (where the spell name appears upon casting) gives the opportunity to have a more detailed spell data collection than was previously possible, which is an exciting prospect (well, exciting in the world of EQ Log Parsing anyway).  It's not easy juggling the priorities of EQu around, but it's about time this one moved up towards the top of the list.
			<br>
			<br>
			There are also still many bugs to be worked out of EQu and it's components as well, but I think I have learned that this will be a perpetualy inevitable side effect to EQu's development.  Which isn't to say they're not important, or don't require a lot of attention - but I think if I focus on fixing every last little bug 24/7, the other stuff will never get finished.

			Today I sent out some email responses to people who received "error 5 Invalid procedure call" that occured when they tried to open a file in the log parser.  In these emails, I requested the first name and the server of the characters you created log files for in order to help me replicate and hopefully fix the error.  Because the error occurs when EQu tries to figure out your server and name from the log file name, I figured this information would be useful to me in troubleshooting the problem.
			<br>
			<br>
			After several negative and/or suspicious responses, I thought it might be appropriate at this time to state my intentions here.  I am <b>NOT</b> requesting station log in names, account keys or anything like that.  In fact, if you ever suspect that kind of info might help me in some way - DON'T send it to me.  I don't ever want to know anything that could give me access to your stuff.
			<br>
			<br>
			What I'm asking for in the emails are simple things like, "Mustard on Torvonnilous", "Bumpa on Tallon Zek", "Emmini on Erollisi Marr" or any other name / server combos that you have created log files for.  This is the same information hundreds, perhaps thousands of people put in their tag lines on message boards, emails and guild web pages.  Even just file names would be great too, like "mustard_44_eqlog.txt" for example.
			<br>
			<br>
			I'd like everyone who receives this and any email from me to know that I would never request any security-compromising info from any of you.  If you don't want me associating a character name with an email address, that's perfectly fine - just say you'd rather not participate or simply don't reply at all.  It's absolutely ok if you feel uncomfortable passing out information of any kind, for any reason.
			<br>
			<br>
			The integrity of EQu is important to me, and I hope everyone continues to view it as a reputable 3rd party EverQuest program.
			<br>
			<br>
			Thanks for reading,

			You'll have to excuse EQu for a few days.  Have to get the cleric to 50 in preperation of Velious.
			<br>
			<br>
			After all, a man's gotta keep his priorities straight.
			<br>
			<br>
			Speaking of Velious, I ordered my copies from outpost.com - but, it doesn't look like I'll be getting them in my hands until at least the 12th, maybe longer.  Hmm... seriously questioning whether or not that is acceptable.  Dunno how fast the store at station.com would be in shipping if I ordered on the 5th.  These things are important to consider - because as we all know, you gotta show up early for that pre-emergency patch loot.  Time is of the essence!

			Resuming work on EQu, looking now at more bug reports.  Out of the errors still coming in, the most frequent now seems to be invalid property values (380) when clicking on the background buttons ("default", "<<", and ">>").  The next patch or two will mainly be bug fix releases as they're discovered and repaired.
			<br>
			<br>
			After the main bugs have been worked out, then fiiiiinaly the Log Parser will begin it's completion.

			I had a dream last night that I was standing in the middle of a busy street, at night.  The streets were wet from rain although it was not raining at that moment, I stood in the middle of traffic as the lights from cars and buildings all shimmered down into the road.  Down the street just about 50 or 60 yards from where I was, also sitting out in the middle of busy traffic was a big black spider's corpse, the big black-widow kind from EQ.  I wasn't playing EQ in the dream, at least I don't think I was, but I targeted the corpse anyway.  It was a "greenzied strathbone's corpse", but all I could really see was "greenzied stra" 'cause of how long names get cut off in the target window.  So, dodging the busy traffic I ran over there and looted it.  It had a spider silk and a shield on it.  I was pretty excited.  But upon inspection I found it wasn't a strathbone shell shield, it was called a PureStrathbone shield, and it had 19 ac, 5 mana, 10 poison resist and 5 to weightedness on it.  I was asking people what the weightedness stat was or what it did, no one knew.  But when put it on, it just seemed to add 5 stone weight to the overall weight of the shield.  I couldn't believe what a crappy stat that was, and I woke up trying to figure out why on earth they would put in a different shield, similar to the strathbone shell sheild, but replace with wis with more weight.

			I'm lookin for a little something called a Strathbone Shell Shield for Mustard.  This mythical item is an 18 ac 8 wis 5 mana 10 sv poison SHM & CLR only shield that weighs 0.4.  Sounds pretty nice, right?  Sure it does.
			<br>
			<br>
			So... EQ nut that I am (not to mention Passion), 12 hours straight killing the 6 spider/ravener spawns in and around the Frenzied Strathbone's room in Kaesora produced no shield.  During this time we killed roughly 200 mobs and saw 5 frenzied strathbones, all of which dropped the common (crappy little mask called Mask of the 8 eyes).
			<br>
			<br>
			So if you're considering this camp for your cleric or shaman, consider yourself warned.  It's a brutal one.  I'm beginning to doubt that the shield even drops anymore...
			<br>
			<br>
			Anyway, I'm taking a little Thanksgiving break until the 27th, so no updates n' stuff for a week.

			The source of Error 53 'file not found' when attempting to patch has been discovered.
			<br>
			<br>
			Here's a list of the errors being looked at... so far, 99% of error submissions are one of these:
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>Error 53 'File not found: 'default.jpg' in the Editor (Half of the errors submitted are this one)
			<li>Error 5 'Invalid procedure call' in the Log Parser.  Got a pretty good guess as to what's causing this actually.
			<li>Error 380 'Invalid property value' in the Editor.  Will have to investigate, dunno what's causing it yet.
			<li>Error 40006 'Wrong connection state' in the Patcher.  Will have to investigate, dunno what's causing it yet.
			<li>Error 70 'Permission denied' in the Patcher.  This might be a patch-server issue.  Perhaps you tried to download a file I was updating or there were to many requests at the time you tried to patch.

			Getting a LOT more error submissions now.  That's great (well, and bad of course heh), but thanks to everyone for using the new feature.  It should help get those bugs rooted out much faster.
			<br>
			<br>
			Speaking of bugs, it seems that the first time you run EQu you'll get the 'default.jpg' file missing error #53.  It shouldn't happen on subsequent runs of the Editor, and is being investigated.  That, and the 'element not found' error #35601 in the Log Parser seem the be the 2 prevelent errors streaming into the "EQu tech support office" at this time.
			<br>
			<br>
			I haven't been watching the message boards too closely for Rowyl's posts, but from what I can gather it looks like log files are now character (and server) specific when created.  For instance, playing character Soandso on Torvonnilous and then Soandso on Erollisi Marr will produce the following seperate log files:
			<br>
			<br>
			eqlog_44_Soandso.txt
			<br>
			eqlog_25_Soandso.txt
			<br>
			<br>
			The number in the log file name represents the 'eqworld' that the character is on (allowing the collection of seperate data for characters with the same name).  The Log Parser's next update will reflect this change by allowing you to select which character's file you'd like to load.

			EQuServerStatus.exe was updated to 1.0.3.  When loading, if the EQu Server Status was unable to connect to the EQSS and then made you to quit, it was not unloading itself from memory properly.  This was fixed.

			There will be a large EQu update today involving all programs.  It's for a new error trapping system that will make reporting the errors you may encounter a lot easier (you just push a button and an email is generated for you).  Becuase it's a tedious hassle to copy down the error message into an email, I assume people were discouraged from reporting bugs and I've been getting some kind of vague, incomplete / inaccurate error reports that I can't do much with.  The new error system will help alleviate these situations quite a bit I hope.
			<br>
			<br>
			Also, the Interface Layout section of the Editor will be disabled for a while.  With the new patch there are now changes that need to be done in that area, and the whole thing needs to be made more accurate.  I might remove it completely (since it's more efficient to adjust your settings in-game anyway) but we'll see how things go.

			If you are linking to or localy hosting EQu on your website, please be advised the EQu install package has been updated.  Version 3.0.9, the version that was previously downloadable in the Get EQu section, became really out of date :)  And that would be OK, since the user could simply update to the latest version using the patcher, however, there is an iffy piece of code in 3.0.9 that (albeit very rarely) causes Active X errors on some machines running older versions of MSIE and Windows 9x.  This required the user to go through a lot of trouble (namely a lot of downloading at www.windowsupdate.com) before they could even use EQu's patcher to get themselves up to date.  This generally causes a lot of confusing technical support for me, and eventually discourages these people from using EQu all together.
			<br>
			<br>
			The new install package not only fixes this problem, but also provides the downloader with a version of EQu that looks like what they may have seen in the See EQu section of the website prior downloading EQu.

			There is a new patch:  EQu 4.0.9, EQu Patcher, 1.1.6, and EQu Log Parser BETA 1.0.0.
			<br>
			<br>
			Also, the See EQu portion of the webpage was updated.

			EQu 4.0.8 clears up an error that occured when starting EQu after the patcher updates the patcher, and fixes a bad menu option.  There is also a new patcher, 1.1.5.  The changes to this are an attempt to get the patcher to display better on some laptops that are having problems with it.  That'll be all the updates for today.
		</UL>

			Ok, I think everything is ready.  EQu 4.0.1 is now available.  Select Patch EQu from the Patch menu to update.
		</UL>
		<br>
		<B>3:50pm MST</B>
		<UL>
			<br>
			4.0.0 is up at this time, but I request you refrain from patching unitl I announce that things are ready (which they aren't).  There are still a few little glytches I'm working out, so if you do patch to 4.0.0 please bear that in mind.  However I had to make it "live" in order to really test it, since I don't exactly have a test patch server or anything ;)
		</UL>

			EQu 4.0.0 might go out today.  It depends on how the testing goes.
			<br>
			<br>
			When it does come out, you'll get the Editor and the Server Status portions.  Then the log parser will come out a little later on.  There is a new patcher for 4.0.0 as well, which fixes the bug that didn't allow you to close the patcher while it was in the middle of something.  If you have connectivity problems during patching, you should be able to shut that sucker down.
			<br>
			<br>
			Well I'm hoping the transition to 4.0.0 will go smoothly, you should just be able to patch as normal and receive all the new files (when it's ready)...

			In the hopes of getting the new EQu out there into everyones hands, I may finish up the editor and server status, update the patcher code and put the new EQu out there (sans log parser).  Then, when the log parser's done, you'll be able to download it via patcher.
			<br>
			<br>
			EQu, the Editor and ServerStatus are pretty much done and working in their new form (the Editor is albeit a crippled version of what is currently out there now).  But since most of you are probably done editing your colors I don't think it'll be too bad.  FYI, you can still edit colors with the current Editor I have ready to release, you just can't open any file you want, or save as, or any of the extra file management stuff yet.  It just grabs the eqclient.ini file from your EverQuest directory by default right now.
			<br>
			<br>
			Mainly the patcher is left to be changed, which really shouldn't be too difficult a change for what needs to be done, then I think I'll put out 4.0.0.

			The Windows API.  The proverbial line in the VB sand that seperates the men from the boys.  I've been reading up, and now... <i>it's time</i>.
			<br>
			<br>
			The eqcleint.ini editor's read and write processes are being rewritten to retrieve and store keys and values to / from the eqclient.ini file.  The sequential text-file reading of the file will be scrapped.  What this means for you is, EQu will no longer care how your eqclient.ini file is ordered, if there's extra line-feeds, comments, etc... as long as the data's in there it'll just work.
			<br>
			<br>
			Key binding will be added to the EQu Editor.
			<br>
			<br>
			I strongly believe that the current method EQu uses to retrieve your windows system folder is producing that fatal "active X couldn't create object" error.  If I'm right about the source of this error, then this will get fixed with a rewrite of the process.  I'm still deciding if EQu even needs to know your windows system folder at all anymore, since I removed system files from the patcher a while ago.  We shall see.
			<br>
			<br>
			EQu will now ask for your EverQuest folder the first time you run it.  After that, you will not fiddle with file access at all, as EQu will just grab the log file and eqcleint file out of the EverQuest directory.  Later on, once everything is in place, the ability to "Save As" will be introduced back into the programs in preperation for the EverQuest Launcher project.
			<br>
			<br>
			The EverQuest Launcher module of EQu will allow you to keep a roster of you characters to which you will be able to bind particular eqcleint and log files to, allowing you to launch EQ with a custom configuration depending on what player you plan on using.  Also, the ability to bind a set of hot-keys and server name that character is wish-listed at this point.
			<br>
			<br>
			The current development schedule is as follows:
			<br>
			<br>
			<UL>
				<li>1. Complete the extraction of the editor into a seperate program

			OK, I thought the whole point to dressing up on halloween got started long ago as a ploy to fool the undead, so they wouldn't be able to tell that you were a potential victim.  You know, like if some undead ghoul sees you, and you're all dressed up like a zombie or somethin, then he just moves along and you live to see another year.  Know what I'm sayin?
			<br>
			<br>
			If you go out tonight dressed up like your favorite basketball player, or you're scampering about in a pirates outfit, don't come cryin to me when a zombie's chompin away at your brains.  Because "I told you so".
			<br>
			<br>
			Now if you wanna get busy living through the night, here's my time-tested plan to a safe and sane halloween:
			<br>
			<br>
			<UL>
				<li>While it's still light outside, go to your local city dump and find some tattered rags.  The more tattered the better.  Dirty a plus.  Liberally wrap yourself, removing your normal clothing first.
				<li>A little rancid meat in the pockets never hurt.  It would also be a good idea to slap a little under the arms and whatnot.  Remember, it's gotta be believeable or you'll have zombie after zombie bellying up to your all you can eat brain buffet.
				<li>Chains or decaying plant matter dragging from the extremities is a nice touch.  And practice your walk - you should appear to have several broken bones and missing/decayed muscles.
				<li>If all else fails, reach over to a passerby and engage in some brain eating yourself.  Nothing's more convincing than a crazy look in the eye and losta blood about the mouth and chin.  Even if an undead isn't tricked by this, he'll <i>respect</i> it.

			There wil not be many updates over the next couple of weeks.  It became necessary to begin on the new EQu.
			<br>
			<br>
			The log parser, server status, and eqclient.ini editors (text colors, defaults, and ui layout) will be 3 seperate programs.  EQu itself will become a launcher, from which you can launch those programs.  In addition to launching EQu components, I have an EverQuest launcher in mind which will be implemented as well.

Sorry for the inconvienence, but I can't release an update for the patcher until the web server is running smoothly again (in which case the problem won't be so bad, little catch 22 there).

			3.4.7 is now available.  The server status tab is not yet a seperate program, but it has been off-loaded onto it's own form.  This is in preperation of transfering it into it's own executeable, getting all of it's code isolated within EQu and testing it's independance first.  Eventaully, the log parser and server status will be seperate executables you can either launch from within EQu or create direct shortcuts to in windows.

			If you are a new user of EQu having problems pertaining to ActiveX being unable to draw/create objects to the screen, <b>please</b> update your operating system at <a href="http://www.windowsupdate.com">Microsoft's Free Update site</a>.  This is a free, no strings attached service that will even work if you, uh, "borrowed" your copy of windows.  Unfortunately there's really no telling what components make EQu happy, but getting the latest internet explorer (5.01 for 9X and 5.5 for 2K / NT), DirectX 7.0a (which you need for EverQuest now anyway) and ALL of the critical updates installs some file, somewhere, that Visaul Basic needs to create objects.  I wish I knew what it was but I don't... it would seem to be a case of ambiguous windows behavior at it's best.

			Well as it turns out, I don't think I'm going to be able to segregate the non-melee stuff.  The only way to tell (that I can think of anyway) if a non-melee message is from a spell or not, is to check to see if you started casting before the non-melee occurs.  Since AE spells have multiple messages per every "You begin your casting", it's nearly impossible to tell if you cast an AE spell, or if you cast a DD spell then say, shot an arrow immediately thereafter.  Compounding this problem, some spells like Harmony produce a "You begin your casting" message and then report nothing more if successful.
			<br>
			<br>
			The only other thing that might be possible, now that I think of it, is to determine if the line immediately *after* a non-melee damage is one of those "mob_00 is affected in some way by the spell" messages (e.g., a moss snake's skin ignites).  AE Spells produce one of these for each thing they hit, so... hmm, maybe.
			<br>
			<br>
			If anyone has any ideas about how to juggle all that and be able tell what is what, I'm open to them.

			Slashing is messed up in 3.4.3's Log Parser, it's been fixed.  Sometimes your success percentages will register as being over 100%, that's been fixed.  Please bear in mind the Log Parser is still beta.  And thanks to those who've sent in things they've found wrong with it.
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm trying to add non-melee melee stuff ( like throwing, archery, proc-ing ) but it's a little tricky to tell the difference between those and actual spell DD messages.  Although I believe it's possible to do, so I'm experimenting with it ( the only thing that really makes it complicated are AE spells, since there are multiple non-melee damage reports and just one "you begin your casting" to match it up to.  That fact may prevent this type of stuff from going in ).

			EQu is getting big.  By big I mean there's a lot going on in little ol' frmMain now.  To be specific, EQu is a handfull of controls away from having the maximum number of allowed controlls on a form.  This means after the log parser is done, it will be physically impossible to add more features to EQu.
			<br>
			<br>
			I believe the obvious approach to solving this is to break down EQu in to sepereate executables, and have the main program be a launcher of sorts.  There are 2 major benefits to this design:
			<br>
			<br>
			<UL>
				<li>EQu's ability to add new features and grow in size will be virtually boundless
				<li>Updating sections of EQu would become much more efficient.  You would only need to download the outdated module as opposed to all of EQu in it's entirety
			</UL>
			<br>
			This change to EQu will be inevitable, and it's tentatively slated for sometime after Log Parser development is complete.  However, if problems related to this issue hinder Log Parser development, it may be addressed prior to the Log Parser's completion.

			Ah, the log parser.  Coming along nicely (again).
			<br>
			<br>
			I am more than a little dissapointed with Comedy Central's Battlebots.  Here's what they need to do to get this show rolling:
			<br>
			<br>
			First of all, get that paid audience outta there.  We all know there aren't THAT many Battlebot fans, if any.  Plus, what this show needs is too dangerous to have people sitting around it behind a plexi-glass wall.  The arena needs to be outside in the desert somewhere and have 20 foot concrete walls several feet thick.
			<br>
			<br>
			Next we need explosives.  And lots of em.  We need land mines, grenade launchers, flame throwers, missles, etc.  I'm talkin about fire, noise, and shrapnel.
			<br>
			<br>
			Bigger, better, faster, smarter robots.  Joe Blow's robot he built in his mom's kitchen is undoubtedly an interesting personal achievement, but it's not going to get TV ratings.  We need a corporate sponsored team of engineers who do nothing but research and build robots full-time.  I want Boeing, GE, Intel and all those big RD resources hard at work designing mobile units of destruction.  There needs to be some silicon chips in those bots making some decisions.  We need titanium plating and ingenious design.  Computer controlled artillery, motion detection, flight... the whole 9 yards.
			<br>
			<br>
			The last element this show needs, is for the viewer to subconsiously fear the robots.  They need to be designed as such so that when you watch them in action, they come off as being lethal to humans.
			<br>
			<br>
			That's a show I'll watch. As it stands now, little tin-can-plated RC's scooting around and bumping into each other at 5mph barely classifies as even mediocre entertainmet.

			As it turns out, the way the log parser was being designed looked good on paper, but... ugh.  The log parser's progress is being delayed while I rewrite it in a more efficient manner.  But get this: a file that was taking 6 minutes to load now takes about 13 seconds and requires none of the extra memory the previous sytem used.  So it's a little better, heh.

			The "chat banner" (that perpetualy apologetic line of blue text that is occasionally scrolling atop the chat section of the login server) is now accessable to EQu.  So if there's one up on the login server, you will also find it scrolling (in blue no less) above the server listing on EQu's Server Status tab.  Expect to see that in the next patch.

			There is now an option in the Server Status tab to "Smart Ping".  Here's the deal:
			<br>
			<br>
			As of now, all of the EverQuest world servers reside on one of 2 networks.  To save time, 1 ping time is sampled from "Network #1", and another ping time is sampled from "Network #2", and then all servers on Network 1 and 2 are assumed to have the same ping time as the samples taken from their respective networks.
			<br>
			<br>
			This physically reduces the amount of pinging EQu does to the EverQuest world servers, and also gives you ping results in a fraction of the time it takes pinging them one-by-one.  I encourage you all to use it!

			You how sometimes, upon entering a zone, you get that bogus message about you taking a swing at some mob and then the mob dies?  That could explain why the log parser reports strike failures vs. mobs when you don't even play a monk (or never really fought that particular mob).  There's really no way to fix this without "playing god" with your log file, which I don't wanna do (after all, it IS possible you walked into a zone with your monk, took a strike at some mob, missed, and it died from a dot immediately thereafter).

Pretty much everything else is not implemented yet, but I wanted to release something workable for 2 reasons.  First, to give everyone a taste of what is to come and to let them make suggestions and comments.  Secondly, this thing is a little more complicated than the rest of EQu and if something's wrong with the logic or it's buggy, I need to know now before I'm in too deep =)

			If you would like to experiment with the log parser, use the "File" tab in the log parser section and load your eqlog.txt file from your EverQuest directory.

			There is currently (in EQu 3.3.7) a bug that makes a ping less than 100 report as unknown.  A new version will be available today that fixes this.

			Spent a little time reformatting / reinstalling the ol' PC today.  Just a little something I like to do about every 6 months, kinda like cleaning house.  I also took apart and cleaned out my keyboard, which involved extracting about 6 pounds of dog hair and non-descript crumbs and debris.  <i>Sweet</i>.  Anyway, there's a little EQu downtime while I clean up my act here.

			I'm aware of the error people are getting while attempting to ping.  I can't get it to occur on any of the PC's here, but I've added some error trapping to the new subs & functions to try and at least find where in the program it's occuring.  Please patch if you are getting the "control array element 10" error.

			The EQu patch you can download today is somewhat of a nerf... after pinging the servers, there is now a forced 5 minute gap before you can do so again.  The logic here being that the EverQuest servers probably could do without being pinged every 30 seconds by hundereds of EQu users.  And of course the more people who find EQu and use the feature, the worse that could potentially get.
			<br>
			<br>
			Additionally, as is the way of the internet, your ping tends to remain the same from hour to hour rather than from minute to minute, so a 30 second ping check was pretty much over-kill.  New values for auto-ping times are now 5 - 60 minutes, and if you choose to ping manually the button will be locked for 5 minutes before you can push it again.
			<br>
			<br>
			This patch doesn't fix the other issues (trace routing and UI Layout spell affect window) mentioned below.

			EQu 3.3.3 now contains the ping functions.  You may notice trace route button which is present on the Server Status tab has been disabled... I found a bug in it at the last moment, so it's been temporarily disabled until a future patch.
			<br>
			<br>
			The ping ability brings the following changes to EQu:
			<br>
			<UL>
				<li>Ping all world servers at anytime using the Ping button (the image of 2 connected computers & a stopwatch adorn the Ping button)
				<li>Set the ping to auto-refresh at an interval from 30 - 90 seconds.
				<li>10 different colors representing various ping values (note the addition of the server ping legend on the Server Status tab)
			</UL>
			<br>
			There is a minor bug in the UI Layout section... in version 3.3.3, if you set your spell affect window using one of the preset shapes (1x15, 2x8 or 3x5), an image of spell icons is now loaded into the frame so that you can see what it would look like in-game.  If you switch screen resolutions at this point, you may have to reset the affect window in order for it to display the appropriate spell affect image.  This is purely cosmetic, and does not actually effect your screen positioning or affect icons in the game.

			Inspired by the crappy connectivity to the servers lately (namely the ones on cerf.net, which of course are the only ones I play on) the ability to ping and perform trace routing on servers is being added to the server status section.  Read on if you don't know what pinging and trace routing are.
			<br>
			<br>
			Pinging a server is a way of finding out how quickly (or slowly) information is being relayed between your computer and the server you play on.  This transmission speed of data is generally measured in milliseconds, so "slowly" is a relative term, but it's still very noticeable when you're playing.  The more milliseconds it takes for you and the server to talk to each other, the worse your connection is.  A high ping makes it difficult to do things in EQ like timing your spells to go off perfectly between mob attacks or to follow someone through a dungeon.  On the EverQuest Lag-O-Meter, your ping is the number furthest to the left.  In EQu, your relative ping to a server will be represented by an appropriately colored box next to the server name which you will be able to hover your mouse over for an exact number.
			<br>
			<br>
			Trace routing is a way of discovering just what exactly is giving you a high ping, or a loss of connectivity, etc.  The information that goes between your computer and verant's servers can get slowed down by the networks it has to travel through on the internet during it's journey.  Trace routing is a method of seeing what networks your data is traveling through and getting a little bit of info on those networks to see where on the internet you're running into trouble.  For example, I'm personally getting real crappy ping to the Torvonnilous server, so I run a trace route to Torvonnilous and see this:

			The data is displayed from the top down, the top being the first step out of my computer and the last (in this case, 17) being the actual world server.  As you can see, everything's normal until I hit sprintlink.net at which point it starts gettin laggy :P  So, even tho I've got DSL, I'll still have a lousy time in EQ due to the route I take on the internet.
			<br>

			You can't really solve anything by seeing this info, but it's nice to at least know why on earth you keep getting dropped, going LD, etc. or whether or not it's just you, or if it's a problem somewhere on the internet.

			Now having VB optimise EQu's code for a smaller executable.  This reduces the size of EQu.exe by about 200k, which is a good thing considering how often I put a new version out.  If you start experiencing any weirdness, lemme know.
			<br>
			<br>
			Thanks to Jenna for assisting in finding a nice little error that was causing EQu to think your eqclient.ini file was missing or bad when it in fact was not.  EQu is a little smarter about finding your files now and you shouldn't get this error anymore.

			As you may notice, I've made the news pop up first on the page.  This makes it easier to notify people of important changes and whatnot.  Speaking of changes...
			<br>
			<br>
			There is now a fix for the MSWINSCK.OCX error.  You can <A href="MSWINSCK_FIX.ZIP">download it here</A> or on the Get EQu page.  It's a setup.exe in a zip that will install MSWINSCK.OCX to your system directory and then register it in Windows so it'll actually work.  So, if you are getting this error just download the .zip file and run the setup.exe within.  Thanks to Grey for letting me abuse his system to come up with this fix :)
			<br>
			<br>
			The UI Layout section of EQu is coming along nicely, although last time I checked, the test server was ignoring the eqclient.ini window positioning data (in fact I couldn't even move my windows around at all while logged into test last night).  So the testing on that has come to a grinding halt until they re-enable the UI stuff on test.  The ability to resize the shape of your chat and "buffs" window are the next thing to go into EQu.
			<br>
			<br>
			To the few of you getting the "eqclient.ini is missing or bad" error - things get better if you patch, and the problem is almost solved.  I can feel it.
			<br>
			<br>
			Gave EQu visuals it's own web section (See EQu)

EQu will allow you to edit these values by providing you with an abstract mock-up of the EQ screen that you can drag the windows around in.

			OK, for what I hope is the last time today, 3.1.3 is up on the patch server and it clears up the little error on the low pop server stat on the server status tab.  I understand this beast is 550 some-odd KB every time you have to patch, and if you're chugging along with a 28.8 or somethin it's not fun to patch.  Today was a hectic exception to patch frequency, and it won't be occurring this often in the future.

			Again I'd like to thank everyone for their bug reports.  At this time, I think the only bugs left are the "really weird exception to the rule" bugs, most of which are on Win2K and on laptops.

			I'm aware of the overflow error you may be getting as the servers are coming back up.  Since the servers have been down for the first time since I've implemented the server status tab, this is essentially it's first trial run, and a few unexpected errors have come up which I aplogize for.  Please run the patcher, as a new EQu (3.1.2) has been put up which fixes the overflow and divide by zero errors.

			The latest version available via patcher is now 3.1.0.  When this version is run, it will check to see if you're on-line.  If you are, it will let you know if there is a new version of EQu available via patcher.  It also has repaired a divide by 0 error on the server status tab.
			<br>
			<br>
			EQu has issues with Windows 2k.  I'm not sure what the deal is, since I don't have a Win2k machine here to play on, but I suspect it has something to do with the way EQu finds your system folder that works in 95/98 but doesn't really work in 2K.  As a quick fix to this, I modified the file listing the patcher requests so that it doesn't attempt to download any system files...
			<br>
			<br>
			Additionally, EQu has issues with laptops as well.  I've gotten a few off the wall reports of EQu acting really wacky on laptops (i.e., bizzare activeX control errors, can see EQu in taskbar but the window doesn't appear on the desktop anywhere).  I have no idea what that problem is yet.
			<br>
			<br>
			Please note, while installing EQu or the patcher, if you get an error with the WININI.DLL file, just choose Ignore and the setup process should complete.  WININI.DLL is a common .DLL file on most people's machines, and should not have been included into the setup package.

			<li>Progress bar for current file progress
			<li>Progress bar for overall patch progress
			<li>Average KB/sec transfer rate while downloading
			<br>

			<br>
			The EQuPatcher is a seperate program that goes hand in hand with EQu, to access the internet and retrieve updated or additional files for EQu.  It eliminates the need to access this website and retrieve the latest files in the form of zip's.
			<br>
			<br>
			The EQuPatcher works in much the same way that the EverQuest patcher does, in that it connects to an "update server" and downloads any files you may need to be current.
			<br>
			<br>
			For those of you installing the EQuPatcher for the first time, after it is installed, you must go out to your EQu folder and run the program manually, as earlier versions of EQu do not have the option to launch the patcher.  Once you have run EQuPatcher.exe and updated EQu, the newer version of EQu has the option to launch the patcher and check for new files.

			Since I have a few days till the next EverQuest patch, I'm upgrading the patcher.  First of all, it's going to download files using a much more "normal" method (using Winsock instead of that Inet transfer control thing).  Using the current method, if you try to download a large binary file you get an access violation error and I dunno why that is... hopefully this will fix that.  Also, I'm seeing if I can add the ability to see progress of the download (for the entire patch and each individual file) as well as your transfer rate, but I'm not sure if it's feasable or not yet.

			This is all nearly working... I made some changes to the server status tab, and there is now a new patcher available that knows how to patch itself... so once you have <a href="patchserver/EQuPatcher.exe">EQuPatcher.exe version 1.0.2</A> you shouldn't have to download any links from this site anymore.  If you've downloaded the other Patchers, you just need to download this directly to your EQu folder, it's not zipped or anything.  If you haven't downloaded any patchers yet, wait for 3.1.0 to come out in an official form, or download a previous patcher, install it, and then download the file above.

			I'm pretty sure there is a problem with the server status code that rears it's head when a server goes down.  Generally, it thinks the downed server is still up, with a full interger value of poeple on it (which is a big number a server could never really support).  So that's no good.  My problem is, it's kinda hard to test for servers being down when they're always up all the time.  This friday, though, I'll be given a few hours to figure it out :)  Please be aware that this Friday you may wanna use EQ ServerScan or something that's proven to work if EQu is giving you grief.  I'll announce on the news here if and when it's fixed, at which point the whole patcher thing and EQu 3.1.0 should go live.
			<br>
			<br>
			Once the server status thing is working right, I believe a log parser is next on the list of features for EQu.  I never really had an interest in a log parser, until I messed around with one called Feekle Log just for fun - at which point it dawned on me that log parsers are actually kinda cool, that there's all KINDS of info you can extract out of them.  My "vision" for EQu lately is to have it be a nice, easy to use, all-in-one program for your EQ-ing needs, and I now believe a log parser is definately one of those needs.

			The ability for the patcher to update itself is being implemented.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Server Status tab, Patch menu, and all HTTP links will check to see if you're on-line or not before they execute.  If you're not on-line, these actions will attempt to initiate your dialer for the net so you can connect.
			<br>
			<br>
			These changes will go live in the form of EQu 3.1.0, which will be available via the on-line patcher once the usual testing period is over.
			<br>
			<br>
			Once EQu version 3.1.0 and the patcher version 1.0.1 have proven themselves to be stable and working, they will be upgraded from beta status and be publically released on the Get EQu page and to the EQ sites, etc.

			The EQuPatcher 1.0.0 and EQu 2.6.0 creates a nasty little endless loop.
			<br>
			<br>
			After a little bit of testing, there's now a new patcher out, version 1.0.1 which you can <A href="EQuPATCHER101.ZIP">download here</A>.  Again, this is "beta" if you care to play with it - once you have Patcher 1.0.1 installed (run the setup.exe in the .zip), run EQuPatcher.exe as you did before, directly from your EQu folder BEFORE you run EQu.exe.  Once you've done this, it should upgrade EQu for you, and from that point on you can initiate the patcher from within EQu without making a special trip out to Windows Explorer.
			<br>
			<br>
			The current version of EQu is now 3.0.2.  <B>Please be aware that, to utilize the Server Status tab, you must be connected to the internet or EQu will produce a run time error.</B>  This will be fixed and cleaned up in the near future, but for now, please be aware you can crash the program pretty easily until this is fixed.  Hopefully though, this version will not produce that endless loop of needing files and trying to download them.

			The patcher is available as a "beta".  The .zip file contains the patcher, patcher's dependancy files, and a new .txt file you need for version 2.6.0 (The new version of EQu available only via the patcher program).  The .zip file does NOT contain a new version of EQu - you will have to run the EQuPatcher.exe to initiate your upgrade.  Here's how you install the new EQuPatcher:
			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="EQuPATCHER100.ZIP">Download the EQuPATCHER100.ZIP file</A>
			<br>
			<br>
			Run the setup.exe file contianed within the .zip file
			<br>
			<br>
			When prompted for an installation folder during the setup process, use the Change Directory button and make it your existing EQu folder (if it's not displayed already)
			<br>
			<br>
			When the setup process is complete, you will need to go to your EQu folder and run EQuPatcher.exe.  The EQuPatcher will initiate an internet connection and update your EQu files.

			The Patch program is complete and has been submitted to the testing team (that'd be my dad and the "wife")
			<br>
			<br>
			It works in the way we're all used to, closely emulating the "old" EverQuest patch program by checking your local files against the server files, and then downloading what it needs as necessary.
			<br>
			<br>
			There is also an "optional patch" button to grab any of those type of "optional" files, which so far consist of extra background images for EQu's text color editing.
			<br>
			<br>
			Once this patch program is in place and working, I just might add sommore features to EQu - like server status, log file parsing, hot-key editing and depending on where Rowly saves window positions will depend on weather EQu tackles that option as well.  File all this under "we'll see what happens".

			Working on an auto-patcher of sorts.  It's basically the same idea as the EverQuest patcher (and just for fun and thrill of copyright infringement, it LOOKS a lot like the EverQuest patcher).  You initiate this program from within EQu - it connects to the 'net, checks out your local files, updates them from the "patchserver" as needed, and then re-starts the main program when it's done.
			<br>
			<br>
			This will require a moderately sized download (I haven't seen the total size yet but I'm assuming a meg or 2) but I feel it should go into EQu for a few reasons: the major one being that it's a cool thing for me to sit down and tinker with as a learning experience, and it will also make life a lot easier for EQu users who haven't spent a whole lot of time in Windows Explorer.  Plus, since I know users of EQu have internet connections, it seems like the natural way to go.
			<br>
			<br>
			The basic framework for it all is layed out, and it's semi-operational thus far.  Just need to iron things out in a few spots, do the usual bug-checking and it should be ready sometime in the near future.

			Like any caster out there, I want a Runed Cowl ( 2 ac +5 wis +9 int, not to mention 0.3 wt head piece ) for my Enchanter.  So, I hopped on good old dad's druid ( lvl 52 ) along with a friend of our's ( lvl 45 shaman ), and him and I started camping stuff in Lower Guk yesterday at about 11 am.  Camped the Ritualist for several hours at first, got the sleeves for my enc and we each got capes, that all went OK.  The Sage room opened up pretty much immediately after obtaining our 2nd cape ( perfect ), around 4 pm I believe.  Shaman took off at around 6 pm after we had broken the room, and from then until 1 am I sat there by myself killing placeholders every 30 minutes.  Half way through this 8 hour ordeal of camping the Sage, he popped once - and dropped the cinch cord.  So if you're planning on camping this little dude for his hat any time soon, here's what you'll need to bring with:
			<UL>
				<li>lawn chairs
				<li>a cooler filled with a variety of beverages
				<li>a lot of food, both in game and out
				<li>deck of playing cards, GameBoy, television
				<li>all your SV Boredom gear
				<li>a large sign to put up on the false wall that says, "Attn: Guk patrons who happen to wander in here while I'm camping the Sage - Please do not aggro the stuff behind this wall!  I've got a system goin' here, and even though it's boring, I don't need the added excitement of taking on 2 frogs at once.  I might not have the mana for it when you walk in here, or you may have walked in right as the Scribe or Sage are about to pop.  Thank you for your understanding and good hunting to you."

			Alright, I think EQu can now read pretty much any eqclient.ini file no matter what order the sections are in, weather it's an older one with 32 colors or a newer one with 34.  And it also no longer cares what order your Defaults are in.

			The remainder of the On-Line manual has been hastily thrown together  :)
		<br>

			Completed work on the "Compact" mode.  I think it will go over well with those of you running lower resolutions.  The only functionality you sacrafice running in Compact mode is the lost of the "battle messages only" edit mode and use of the RGB sliders.  You can still double & right-click on options to bring up the color picker, and you can change your backgrounds by double-clicking the background image somewhere away from a line of text (double-clicking a line of text brings up the color picker).  Oh, and I modified the Woot Tick (tm) ever so slightly so that it points to "both sides" when you're in Compact mode.
		<br>

			You can now link directly to the On-Line manual from the Help menu.

			Your EQu screen real estate woes are being heard.  It's a lagitamate issue, since we can't all run in 1024x768 and EQu is starting to sprawl out across the screen a bit excessively.  I'm experimenting wtih a "compact / full" view toggle, which should shrink EQu down to where it will fit on a 800x600 screen.  I'm not sure what I can do for those of you who like to use the Large Fonts in Windows, but I'll check it out.  Windows tends to over-ride any specific font settings I put into EQu, so I dunno if there's anything I can do about that other than to just allow for a lot more space (which, unfortunately, is at a premium right now).

			Just discovered this, and I don't know if it's been an on-going issue or if it's new to the patch.  Setting a color to R=255, G=0, B=255 (bright magenta, aka bright pink) will render the message invisible.  This is most likely due to EQ's engine filtering out this color for your little item textures and stuff (all the item pictures in the game are all placed on a big bright pink sheet and taken from there when needed.  The bright pink is filtered out so all you're left with is the picture of the object).
			<br>
			<br>
			So, beware of that.  If you make something the color Red 255, Green 0, and Blue 255 all you will see are blank lines in your text box in EQ.  I'll think of a way to handle this anomoly later, or maybe VI will fix it.

			Someone please explain "Pringle Packets" to me.  If you haven't seen this, is a small plastic casing designed specifically to house about a dozen Pringle potato chips so you can have Pringles "on the go".  That in of itself is fine I guess, albeit a bizzare idea most certianly doomed to failure, but what I don't get is the marketing angle - the product is presented in that flashy, colorful, no attention span, MTV "hey it's a dance party" syle, with a bunch of 12 year old kids flyin around like crazy.  Are Pringle Packets the big thing with the kids today, or are they just trying to appear that way?  The commercial's music is an adaptation of Devo's "whip it".  It just doens't make sense, and quite frankly, it's freakin me out.

			Future installs and patches of EQu should go a lot smoother.  When running a setup.exe to patch EQu, it now just copies files without trying to make another program group and item on your start bar.  All that nonsense about making sure you select the same program group that was created with the full install is now a thing of the past.  There's a new patch up for those who haven't patched to 2.2.0 yet.
			<br>
			<br>
			Also, new users of EQu download version 2.2.0 of the full installation, which doesn't put the version number in the name of the shortcut on the Start bar.  This eliminates the version number conflict going on between what your Start bar shortcut says and what EQu says on the About EQu screen.

			<br>
			<br>
			The 2nd background has been implemented
			<br>
			<br>
			User_32 edits the /random (i.e., **A magic die has been rolled by soandso) message color.  Went ahead and added that to your options, BUT, it sounds like "Rowyl" is planning on modifying the eqlcient.ini file next patch, so User_32 might end up doing something different when it's all said and done.

			Put the text color option-buttons in a frame.
			<br>
			<br>
			Current color box now floats above copy color box
			<br>
			<br>
			Double-clicking the current color, sample text, or text options will pull up the Color Picker.  It is also listed on the pop-up menu as well when right-clicking an option or sample text.
			<br>
			<br>
			When color picker is called up, it's default color is that of whatever's being currently edited.
			<br>
			<br>
			The right-click popup menu is now just 1 page with no sub-menus.
			<br>
			<br>
			Removed the "change backgrounds" button from the toolbar, replaced with a button that pulls up the color picker.
			<br>
			<br>
			Added the expand/contract button to the toolbar for showing/hiding the 2nd background.
			<br>
			<br>
			You cannot access the color picker if the sliders are locked.

			"Battle messages only" option is being postponed and will remian unavailable until I see what changes will be made to the eqclient.ini file in the next EverQuest patch.
			<br>

			2.2.0 will probably be released before the next EverQuest patch, since all changes are ready with the exception of the "Battle messages only" option.

			Had a simple yet nice idea submitted to me (from Gavin) to have more than just one background, so you can see your changes against multiple backrounds without having to flip back and forth between them.  I've decided to implement this in the form of an "toggle" button on the toolbar that will push out the right edge of EQu to reveal a second sample area, or retract EQu to it's normal size to hide it.  I'm leaving this as an optional thing you can turn on and off since it makes EQu's width pretty huge (you'll need at least a 1024x screen res to house a fully extended EQu).
			<br>
			<br>
			Background selection has been modified to drop-down combo boxes, which is slightly easier to use than the way it worked before (credits to Luc for that idea).  There will be 2 of these side by side on the Text Colors sheet for setting the backgrounds of the 2 sample areas.

			There's been a lot of requests for the addition of the traditional windows Color Picker to EQu.  At first I wasn't gunna do it, but I've found a very nice and simple way to keep the RGB sliders and the color picker talking to each other, so it looks like a Color Picker is going into the next release!  I'm going to add a Color Picker button to the toolbar, so there will be just 1 button to push to access the Color Picker for whatever color you happen to be editing.  Access to the color picker will also be added to the popup menu when right-clicking a text type.

			There's currently issues with Verant's color code that makes your spell messages not quite right.  From what I can determine from the emails (haven't had time to play myself), is whatever color you set you "Spell castings" to be (User_9), your "spell has worn off" and "spell resisted" messages are becoming that color too (regardless of what you set "spell has worn off" to be).  Once Verant fixes that, your spells messages should look right.  The other issue, is that of "Money split".  If you alter the Money split color, you will only see that new color if YOU loot the mob.  If someone else loots, the Money split color is still it's default green.
			<br>

			The scheduled release for EQu patch version 2.2.0 is sometime shortly after Verant releases their next EQ patch.
