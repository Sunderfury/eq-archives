<ul><li>&#147;Besieged&#148; is a defensive battle fought on the Aradjiah continent, the setting of the Treasures of Aht Urhgan expansion disc. Adventurers join the conflict between the Aht Urhgan Empire and the beastmen over a treasure called the &#147;Astral Candescence.&#148; The goal of Besieged is to defend the *Imperial capital when the beastmen breach its defenses in search of the Astral Candescence, and to recover the treasure from one of the beastman strongholds in the event it is taken.</li></ul></p><p>
</p><a id="The_Astral_Candescence" name="The_Astral_Candescence"></a><h2 class="wheader">The Astral Candescence</h2><p>
<ul><li>The Astral Candescence is the name of the treasure over which the beastmen and the Aht Urhgan Empire are fighting. The mysterious object emanates an unperceivable melody from its place atop an &#147;astral plinth.&#148; This melody has the power to affect both the players and the beastmen.</li></ul></p><p><b>When the Astral Candescence is in the Empire of Aht Urhgan:</b>
<ul><li>The Astral Candescence is located on the astral plinth in the Hall of Binding.</li><li>Players will receive an experience bonus while under the effect of Sanction.</li></ul></p><p><b>The following bonuses can be earned in exchange for Imperial Standing credits:</b>
<ul><li>Latent effect: Regen, Latent effect: Refresh, increased meal duration</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>These bonuses become more powerful with the number of times Al Zahbi is successfully defended. *However, they will revert to their original strength if the Astral Candescence is taken by the beastmen. You can confirm the current number of successive victories by speaking to an Imperial guard in town.</li></ul></p><p><b>When the Astral Candescence is in a beastman stronghold:</b>
<ul><li>The Astral Candescence is located on an astral plinth.</li><li>The beastmen will become more powerful by an amount determined by the number of &#147;archaic mirrors&#148; in the stronghold.</li><li>When fighting in a beastman stronghold where the Astral Candescence is located, you will receive an increased number of Imperial Standing credits.</li></ul></p><a id="Sanction" name="Sanction"></a><h3 class="wheader">Sanction</h3><p>
<ul><li>You can speak to an Imperial guard to receive Sanction after becoming a mercenary. Defeating monsters with Sanction cast on you will allow you to receive crystals and may increase your </li></ul>
Imperial Standing.
<ul><li>You may only receive Sanction in the Treasures of Aht Urhgan areas, but only Signet is available in all previously released areas, so please take care when traveling between regions.</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>Your Imperial Standing is a measure of how much you have individually contributed to the Empire of Aht Urhgan. Imperial Standing credits can be used in a number of beneficial ways, such as exchanging them for items, or using them to earn transport to staging points.</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>You can increase your Imperial Standing by defeating monsters that you can gain experience points from.</li></ul></p><p>

In the event that all five generals fall in battle, the seal will be broken, and the beastmen will be able to enter the hall. If the beastmen manage to reach the astral plinth inside, the Astral Candescence will be taken and the battle to defend Al Zahbi will be lost. </li></ul></p><a id="Rewards" name="Rewards"></a><h3 class="wheader">Rewards</h3><p>
<ul><li>Experience points and Imperial Standing credits are awarded for participation in Besieged depending on the player&#146;s contribution to the defensive effort.

These key items will be lost in the event that you log out or leave the area and must be reacquired before entering the battlefield.</li><li>3. The battlefield will have no level restriction, but only six people may enter at a time.</li><li>4.

<a rel="nofollow" href="Corsair">&#91;1&#93;</a></p><p>Corsair Job Traits</p><p>- Resist Paralyze (Level 5)
Gives you a slight resistance against paralysis.</p><p>Corsair Job Abilities</p><p>- 2-hour ability: Wild Card (Level 1)
Has a random effect on all party members within area of effect.
<ul><li>The Wild Card ability is not affected by the Wild Card effect.</li></ul>
- Phantom Roll (Level 5)

- Double-Up (Level 5)
Enhances an active Phantom Roll effect that is eligible for Double-Up.
- Quick Draw (Level 40)

<ul><li>The effects of enfeebling magic that match the element of the card may be enhanced.</li><li>The corsair must equip a gun and ammunition, and be in possession of the appropriate elemental card in order to use this ability e.g. Fire Shot requires a fire card. One card is consumed with each use of the ability.</li></ul>
- Random Deal (Level 50)
Has the possibility of resetting the recast time of a random ability for party members within area of effect.
<ul><li>The Random Deal ability is not affected by the Random Deal effect.</li></ul></p><p>Acquiring Phantom Rolls
The Phantom Roll ability is learned at level 5. However, in order to use this ability, corsairs must use &#147;dice&#147; to learn various rolls, in much the same way scrolls are used to learn spells. Acquired rolls will appear in a sub-menu after selecting Phantom Roll.</p><p>image</p><p>Using Phantom Roll
When the Phantom Roll ability is used, a number (in roman numerals) from &#147;I&#148; to &#147;VI&#148; is generated and party members within range gain the effect of the roll. The number displayed affects the degree of the roll's effect.</p><p>- Double-Up
For 45 seconds after using a Phantom Roll, the corsair will have the option of using the Double-Up ability. This period of time is represented by the &#147;Double-Up Chance&#148; icon.
Using Double-Up will once again generate a number from &#147;I&#148; to &#147;VI,&#148; which is then added to the total of the previous roll.</p><p><ul><li>Corsairs can continue to use the Double-Up ability as long as the Double-Up Chance icon remains.</li></ul></p><p>- Phantom Roll totals
The effect of a roll will continue to increase as the total rises from &#147;I&#148; to &#147;XI.&#148; However, if the total reaches &#147;XII&#148; or more, the roll will &#147;Bust.&#148;
Each Phantom Roll has a lucky and unlucky number. Obtaining a total equal to a roll&#146;s lucky number will produce an effect second only to a total of &#147;XI.&#148; A total equal to the unlucky number will produce an effect weaker than a total of &#147;I.&#148;
If the roll becomes a &#147;Bust,&#148; party members will lose the effect of the roll and the corsair will experience an additional penalty.
<ul><li>A &#147;Bust&#148; will reduce the number of possible active Phantom Rolls by one, as well as inflict a detrimental effect corresponding to a &#147;Bust&#148; roll.</li></ul></p><p>- Special effects of Phantom Roll
The effect of a Phantom Roll will be enhanced depending on the type of roll and the main jobs of party members. For example, when a Fighter&#146;s Roll is used, the effect of the roll will be greater if a warrior is in the party.</p><p>- Things to consider when using Phantom Roll</p><p>Characters with corsair set as a main job can have a
maximum of two active Phantom Rolls, while those with corsair as a support job are limited to one active Phantom Roll effect.</p><p>The Phantom Roll effects of a character with corsair set as a support job are weaker, and do not gain the bonus effect from the presence of the applicable main job in the party.</p><p>A Phantom Roll effect cannot be reapplied until after it has worn off or been removed.
<ul><li>As of the July version update of 2006, a character using bard songs and the corsair ability Phantom Roll is able to stack up to 3 effects on each party member.</li></ul>
However, a single character is only able to receive up to a total of 12 combined Phantom Roll and bard song effects.

Automatons are constructed from three types of components--a head, a frame, and various types of attachments. Your automaton will start out with the standard head and frame parts, but there are also parts available specifically for melee, magical, and ranged combat.
There are also numerous types of available attachments that allow you to customize your automaton with a range of abilities.</p><p>Customizing Your Automaton
You can customize your automaton from the &#147;Automaton&#148; sub-menu found under &#147;Equipment&#148; in the main menu.</p><p>1. Head
The head equipment slot.
The type of head you select will affect the automaton's positioning in battle, as well as direct its basic behavior patterns.
2. Frame
The frame equipment slot.
The type of frame will affect the abilities and magic available to the automaton.
3. Attachments
The attachment equipment slots.
A maximum of 12 attachments can be equipped on your automaton, regardless of the selected head or frame.
4. Maximum capacity
This value represents the automaton's maximum capacity for equipping attachments.
The combined values of the head and frame parts set the limit for each elemental capacity.
5. Attachment functions
The functions or abilities provided by each individual attachment.
6. Required capacity
These values represent the elemental capacity required to equip the attachment.
Attachments with requirements that exceed the maximum capacity cannot be equipped.
7. Skill
The various skill values of your automaton. </p><p><ul><li>An activated automaton cannot be customized. You must first deactivate your automaton in order to change its equipped parts.</li><li>Any combination of head and frame parts can be equipped; however, not all combinations are equally functional.</li><li>When a puppetmaster has equipped attachments that can only be used with a certain type of head or frame, it is not possible to equip other head or frame parts that do not support those attachments. You must remove those attachments first before attempting to equip a different head or frame.</li></ul></p><p>Controlling Your Automaton
An automaton will act automatically in relation to its equipped attachments.
It is possible to give simple commands such as attack and retreat, but you cannot command your automaton to use specific spells or abilities.</p><p>Effects of Maneuvers
Using a maneuver command will cause the automaton to give priority to actions that correspond to that maneuver's element.
Maneuver commands will also activate the abilities of corresponding attachments.</p><p>Fire Maneuver: STR/Attack/Increase enmity
Ice Maneuver: INT/Elemental magic/Magic attack
Wind Maneuver: AGI/Evasion/Ranged accuracy
Earth Maneuver: VIT/Defense
Thunder Maneuver: DEX/Accuracy
Water Maneuver: MND/Magic defense/Curing
Light Maneuver: CHR/HP recovery
Dark Maneuver: MP/MP recovery</p><p><ul><li>In order to use the Maneuver commands, the puppetmaster must equip a special item called an &#147;animator.&#148;</li></ul>
An animator is obtained along with the puppetmaster job. If you throw away the animator by accident, you must pay an expensive sum to obtain another one.</p><p>Overload</p><p>Using a maneuver will increase the burden associated with that maneuver's element. When that burden exceeds a certain amount, the automaton will become overloaded.
An overloaded automaton will be temporarily unresponsive to maneuver commands, and will experience a reduction in combat ability.</p><p><ul><li>The burden associated with maneuver commands will gradually decrease over time.</li><li>Activating an automaton will also increase an automaton&#146;s burden.</li></ul></p><div class="wikicats">Categories:  <a class="new" href="/wiki/Category:FFXI_Updates">FFXI Updates</a> | <a href="/wiki/Category:Final_Fantasy_XI">Final Fantasy XI</a> </div>
