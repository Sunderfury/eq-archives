    <div class="Preview"><div class="cont"><div class="Buffer"></div><h3 class="Subhead">Forum trolls joke of white knights waiting for a "Golden Patch," but what if it's real?</h3><p>Darkness surrounds you, perilous traps await you and spiders crawl all  over your back. You&rsquo;re in a dark cave somewhere in the Black Shroud,  mindful that the slightest misstep could be your last. And you&rsquo;re in  this cave for one reason, and one reason only -- to find the mythical  Golden Patch, the most coveted treasure in all the land. <br /> <br /> After  overcoming numerous obstacles -- including swinging on a whip across a  spike-filled pit (good thing you brought your whip, because you can&rsquo;t  jump)  -- you find yourself face to face with your gleaming bounty. The  Golden Patch sits unguarded on an alter, ready to be taken if you dare  to take it. You approach the pedestal, and then kneel down to behold the  treasure's beauty. You reach for it, but you stop just short. Your hand  is just a breath away. <br /> <br /> And that&rsquo;s when you ask yourself: &ldquo;Do I believe in the Golden Patch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This  is the question many fans of Final Fantasy XIV will be asking as we  edge closer to the largest version update this game may ever see. And if  this update is all it could be, then I&rsquo;m going to proclaim it as the  coming of the Golden Patch. <br /> <br />What exactly is this Golden Patch  which I speak of? Honestly, the first time I saw this term mentioned was  about a month ago in our FFXIV General Forum. Players have debated the  origin of the term, but critics of the game were saying &ldquo;the Golden  Patch&rdquo; in reference to the massive content patch that everyone hoped  would be implemented when the game was launched last September. <br /> <br />The  term has a nice ring to it, doesn&rsquo;t it? Just say it: &ldquo;The Golden  Patch.&rdquo; After so many tweaks and minor changes to Eorzea over the past  several months, a Golden Patch sounds like just what this game needs --  never mind the fact that the term was probably invented by forum trolls  just to pick on White Knights. I never heard anyone specifically mention  the Golden Patch as the game&rsquo;s servers went live. I didn't believe in  the legend. <br /> <br />Now, though, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder -- is the Golden Patch real? <br /> <br />And will it come this month? <br /> <br />In  his tenth Letter from the Producer, FFXIV producer Naoki Yoshida  unleashed an updated grid of updates planned for the game. All of these  changes would constitute nothing short of an overhaul. There&rsquo;s auto  attack, the company system, the addition of materia, auto attack,  traditional Final Fantasy jobs, instanced dungeons and more. And the  most amazing thing is this could all be implemented by the middle of  June. <br /> <br />Keep in mind, the timeline is far from set in stone, but  Yoshi-P bolded in his letter that these changes were what were planned  up &ldquo;until summer 2011.&rdquo; A community representative on the Square Enix official forum later confirmed this meant changes would happen through the end of summer, but we still don't know exactly which changes will be doled out when. In the past, Yoshi-P has told us we could expect at least the new battle system, new dungeons and new jobs to be released around the same time.<br /> <br />Just  think. In two weeks from now, there&rsquo;s a chance you may be able to join a  party in Ul&rsquo;dah, hop on a mount (let&rsquo;s hope mounts in this game are  covered with feathers and &ldquo;kweh&rdquo; frequently) and ride to an experience  points camp anywhere on the map. Once you&rsquo;ve reached your camp, you may  have dedicated tank, healer, support and damage-dealing jobs. Or, if you  don&rsquo;t feel like partying, you could solo, do storyline quests or  participate in company quests -- that&rsquo;s if your linkshell isn&rsquo;t about to  run one of the new instanced dungeons. <br /> <br />If all these changes are implemented simultaneously -- or even in the span of a few weeks -- how could that not be the manifestation of the mythical Golden Patch?  <br /> <br />Most  players will not expect the development team to pull off such a  game-changing patch, and with good reason. After spending hundreds of  dollars on computer upgrades to play an unfinished game, we&rsquo;ve had to  endure several months of tweaks and small content additions as the  development team worked behind the scenes on larger, more important  changes. We entered a five-star restaurant expecting an exquisite steak  dinner, but instead we&rsquo;ve been fed ground beef after being forced to buy  our way in. It&rsquo;s no wonder why some people are so angry with Square  Enix. <br /> <br />Plus, the game needs revisions that aren't listed in the  upcoming patch notes. We desperately need a party search function,  linkshell management tools and a mailbox system. We need more quests  with cutscenes, and the small amount of lag still in the user interface  needs to be completely gone. Square Enix should also continue working to  reduce the game's burden on PC hardware. My computer has two dual-core  graphics cards, and one of my cores recently stopped working. I can't  help but wonder whether FFXIV is to blame. <br /> <br />That said, the new  development team led by Yoshi-P has done nothing to betray our trust.  They&rsquo;ve done everything they said they would. And now, Yoshi-P seems to  be telling us that all of these game-altering revisions could be  implemented sometime this month. These changes will profoundly and  positively change the way we interact with Eorzea. This game has been  taking shape for months, but this is the patch that could finally give  this game an identity. Although the launch of Final Fantasy XIV turned  out to be a colossal letdown, this development team has given me no  reason to be pessimistic about the game&rsquo;s future. <br /> <br />If FFXIV  dies, it will ultimately be because Square Enix rushed the game out in  an unfinished state. In the months that followed, too many players lost  faith (or patience) in Square Enix&rsquo;s ability to turn things around. When people started talking about "the Golden Patch," they were conjuring a symbol of what the game has needed since launch -- an impossibly successful patch to spark a seemingly impossible comeback. I don't think even the Whitest of Knights took the notion of a Golden Patch seriously. It was such a ridiculous notion, which is probably why so many trolls lached onto it.<br /> <br />Yet now, here we are. We&rsquo;ve  come this far, and now we&rsquo;re at the alter, and the mythical Golden Patch  seems finally at our fingertips. It&rsquo;s so close, we could reach out and  take it. Is it wise to put our faith in this patch, after so many months  of turmoil? Will we finally be rewarded for our months of  perseverance, or will we be crushed by a cascading boulder of  disappointment? <br /> <br />What do you believe?</p><a name="pagebreak" title="pagebreak"></a></div><div class="Buffer-bot"></div></div>

        <div class="post-text">all have to remember: even ff11 in all of its glory, (which im a big fan of, played 7 years)was very similar to ff14 when it first come out! we didnt get it in the united states till one year after released in JP!in that first year ff11 was very limited lvl cap 50. very limited jobs think it was whm/blm/rdm/war/thf/mnk and very limited gear. wasnt till the first expansion (now otherwise known as a patch because of easy download ability and faster internet speeds)&quot;the rise of zilart&quot; till the subject content was better and advanced jobs pld/drk/drg/nin/ came available along with AF and 60 cap. then the adition of COP (which was very challenging at lvl 30 cap) a year or two later was even more appealing to the brain. needless to say ff11 didnt have to deal with 50 other MMORGP's coming out of the woodwork to compete with, i think was everquest and wow in the begining stages. yes ff14 has had it downfalls with the lack of an item search system for the wards, no party search option, lack of content, the anima sytem for telaporting which doesnt reproduce fast enough!i think the game was thrown out there a little early, but all in all i think it will surpass ff11 in the long run with the abuilty to equip lerned abuiltys from any job too any job is awsome. pluss the level progression is mutch faster on 14 than ff11, in ff11 if you were a moderate player it would take u 6 mounths to reach 60+ in 14 u can do in a matter of weeks which is a big pluss in my book!not to mention the crafting system is alot better too! anyways i just think people need to step back a min a see the bigger picture, this game has alot of potential and im sure the end result will be satisfaction, SE has always come threw for us! DRK for life :P</div>

        <div class="post-text">Personally, I'm just gonna wait and see. Though honestly, I find it difficult to imagine SE screwing this up, given what they've said is coming. <br /> <br />But at the same time, even if this patch does deliver everything that was promised, I still wouldn't call the game &quot;fixed&quot; afterwords. It'll be a huge step in the right direction, but the journey has only just begun. There's still a long, hard road ahead before FFXIV can be called &quot;up to par&quot; with the current competition, even after this patch is implemented.</div>

        <div class="post-text">Since the games launch the individual patches haven't been anything too spectacular, but looking back the game is significantly more enjoyable then it was at release. Now if we take this idea one step further and comprise all of the patches we've seen since launch and released it at once I still wouldn't qualify that as a golden patch. <br /> <br />I think the june patch is going to give everyone 1 instanced dungeon an as we already know 1 job per class, as well as implementing the basics of the materia system. The game is still going to primarily be a grind with little end game rewards and not something you'd suggest to your friends. <br /> <br />The feeling i get on the forums is everyones isn't expecting anything that spectacular, but we'll probably get a more clear idea of whether or not FFXIV stands any actual chance and if future content is going to deliver the kind of refreshing depth, complexity, and innovation we got in FFXI's updates. The lack luster quest and NM updates didn't really get anyone all that jazzed up about FFXIV's future. </div>

It is all the same.  How the software preforms on the hardware because it is not optimized is a different story. <br /> <br />But you can't blame the software for making your hardware fail.  Hardware fails from use and a component of it fails because it wears out.  Your hardware would have failed just as easily by running Windows7 all day long playing MP3's as it would running FFXIV.   <br /> <br />If you are referring to how FFXIV runs your PC at 100% all the time it's because you don't have adequate hardware to run it.  Could FFXIV be optimized so that it doesn't do this? Sure! <br />But it's not the cause of hardware failure because the hardware is doing what it was designed to do.</div>

        <div class="post-text">I think the 'golden patch' helped create the problem of the game as it is now.  During alpha/beta there were *so many* white knights that if anyone said the slightest thing negative about the game they were drowned out and called trolls, told to 'go back to wow', etc.  Even when the game launched it was the same thing.  People were told 'stop complaining it will all be fixed!'  And now we look back and almost everyone is in agreement that the game was released in a shoddy, unfathomable state.  All the shouting got the dev team replaced, and now we're seeing progress.  Sometimes, people complain out of love, not because they need to 'go back to wow'.  :)  That's what testing is for, right? <br /> <br />I don't think this will be the 'golden patch', but I do think this could go a long way to earning a significant amount of trust back, and will be a good sign as they eventually ramp up marketing towards a PS3 release (and hopefully new, justifiably positive reviews.)</div>

        <div class="post-text">I think 'The Golden Patch' was believed to exist by beta testers more than anyone.  We watched the game crawl along throughout the beta testing process with so few changes, we all believed there was going to be some giant patch the last week of testing.  I mean, it just wasn't possible they were going to release it the way it was, right?  When it didn't come, we believed it would be before release.  Shocked when the game was released and most of the issues remained, we were sure it would happen the first month.  And then... well, the downward cycle of despair as we watched, and never saw things drastically improve. <br /> <br />I think these next couple months will be make or break time, but especially patch 1.18.  Yoshi-P has set some high expectations with all this info.  I hope he can deliver. <br /> <br />As I've done since closed beta, I remain vigilant.  And I camp the mythical Golden Patch, waiting for it to pop.  And when it does, please let it drop phat lootz.</div>
