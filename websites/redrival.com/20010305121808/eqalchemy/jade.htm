<CENTER><H2>Complete Guide to Jade Chokidai Prod</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>The jade Prod is an awesome looking weapon,worthy to any shaman :).It is relatively easy to get,from lvl 44 and up,the Chancellor can be soloed pretty well.I got mine after only the second try...solo.The Sarnak castle is located in the Lake of ill Omen zone.The best way to get there (if no druid or wiz available) is to take the shuttle from BB to Fironia Vie,than run a short distance to the Lake of ill Omen zone.After you zoned in follow the stream,until you reach the Lake,and with the lake on your right hand side,run until you reach the castle.The main entrance to the <A HREF="main.jpg">Castle</A><BR> is located at -2512, +3485.Cast invis before you enter the castle,99% of the sarnaks cant see invis( not even the Chancellor) Keep the wall on your left hand side until you reach a <A HREF="room1.jpg">giant room</A><BR>,with tables and  chairs.The Chancellor will be sitting in the middle of the room close to the wall (he was just killed on this screenshot)The loc to the dining room is -2506, +4712. The Chancellor is at -2512, +5020.Move to the right corner all the way up,summon a pet, med up.He doesn't have a whole lot of HP,but since he is a shaman,he can heal himself,and he also has a pet wolf.He is around lvl 38 to 40,coned blue to 51.If a sarnak wonders up to the platform,kill him before the fight.The spawn time is about 2 hours.Happy hunting :)</CENTER>
