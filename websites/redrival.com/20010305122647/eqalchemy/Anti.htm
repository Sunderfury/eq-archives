<P>Stat buff,and disease save,it does stack with the resist Disease spell,by adding Blue Vervain Bulb  to the recipe, it will make a regular potion adding +5  (-5) to all stats, for a total of 10 (-7+10) and by adding Valerian Root to the recipe it will make a greater potion adding +20 (-20) to the stats.While making lesser potion is trivial at early lvls (mid 20s) regular potions and greater potions are much harder to make.I suggest,dont even try to make regular potion until  skill 45 and greater until skill 80.</P>
