The screen shots will be coming. Be patient I am still learning this HTML stuff.


Long ago, when Kailyn was lower level, they finally fix barbarian helms so they show with the right color. And the shrink spell came out about the same time. The server is still young, as there are still people using steel. Anyway,<a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/Bronze.jpg> Kailyn</a> in Bronze and her crafted helm.<BR><BR>

Up close and personal with the <a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/AoF.jpg>Avatar of Fear</a>. He was the first high level mob I wanted to kill and I still get a special rush from doing battle with him.<BR><BR>

Do you play with particles turned off? I don't. (Nice computer, good computer). Here is what full <a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/Burn.jpg>burn</a> looks like. There is a mob in there somewhere.<BR><BR>

You remember being <a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/Drunk!.jpg>drunk</a> for the first time in game? I am looking down in this shot.<BR><BR>

You ever catch a dragon napping? We'll we didn't but <a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/DistantNaggy.jpg>Lord Nagafen</a> was still in his room.<BR><BR>

I was summoned while he was back there, then he went to greet some other's at the door, leaving me where I was. He does have quite a <a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/Naggy%20Wings.jpg>wing span</a>.<BR><BR>

Oh happy day! Here I am convincing the <a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/Kailyn!.jpg>Ghoul Lord</a> to give me my second Ykesha.<BR><BR>

I did try being a <a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/Stats.jpg>stats</a> warrior. Even then I could not bring myself to get rid of all my AC stuff. I only had 1 Ykesha so in the off hand is the Shield of the Slain Unicorn.<BR><BR>

As requested, a pic of <a href=http://www.topcities.com/videogames/kailyn/51pic.jpg>Kailyn</a> at 51 with her gear. She has 1 buff on for MR and wituout the buff MR would be 52. The list of gear can be found on the gear page.<BR><BR>

Heh, in a what the hell mood...I have not posted any new profile pics in a long time. And while magelo is great (and I use it to manage my charicters) it is dynamic and does not show the history of change. So that said here is a <a href=http://kailyn.topcities.com/KAI60C.jpg>pic at 60th</a>, unbuffed, 8 AAs spent.<BR><BR>

Do you remember they added the balance animation? I hadn't. Here is <a href=http://kailyn.topcities.com/Ary_balance.jpg>Aryalla</a> walking the plank. And I need to get a real pic editor which will allow me to save as Jpg and resize at the same time.<BR><BR>
