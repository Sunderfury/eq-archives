Some really nice work here! Great infact. I have gotten back into the game and should be posting some new stuff soon. First up is probably a rant about the twig and the whip. Grrr. At 50th (with my old formulas) the whip is better, at 60th the twig, for primary hand. <p>The reason I did not originally include the level bonus for Max hits is that you so rarely get hits which are over Max, much less an extra 8 points over. I think I have seen 1 hit with my Yks for 48 points. YOu cna increase max by level bonus, but you would probably have to decrease the weighting on Max then. <p>The nice thing about my current fomula (.45 Min + .45 MN + .1 Max)/delay is that pre Kunark it gave reasonable approimations of real world damage (just lucky there) is easy to figure, and seems to an excelent job of predicting which weapon is the best for your current situation. <p>I posted the fomula on Verant's MB a long time ago and using player provided info I could accureatly guess their average damage. I know that it seems to estimate everythign 10% low, so I would add that when guessing their real world damage.
