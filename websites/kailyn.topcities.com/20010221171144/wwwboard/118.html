I feel that duel weild has a considerable advantage over 2handers.  Here is why.. against players in specific i found that ANY hit not just a bash has  a chance to disrupt casting, unlike monsters where you must bash, so that is one reason i feel duel weild has an advantage.  Also, i feel the power of 2 yaks with a FBSS is great compared to that of any single 2 hander.<br>As you post have show the yaks do a little bit more damage NOT counting the Procs..... counting in the proc which any high level warrior with a considerable amount of dex will proc quite often.  I dont believe that i have not proced during a fight at least one against blue's or higher.  I tis also easier to Ghetto bash with duel weild, but i play a troll so slam is just as good IMHO....<br>I know this reason sounds dumb but also in PVP if you get disarmed you still should get at least one more swing in with your other weapon, where as a 2 hander must pick it up to do any damage....  just my rant, please reply with any opinions or tests<p>Borys Smells<br>Vallon Zek<br>Xanit K'ven
