You could also note that two-handers generally do better against opponents' ripostes because the damage they do isn't tied to their delay.  And that two-handers don't tend to chew up quite as much STA.<p>On the other hand, you could note that one-handers seem to taunt a little better.  Or that you can ghetto bash with one-handers, but it is very difficult to do with two-handers.  And you could counter the damage shield argument by noting that, at high levels, you're almost always grouped with someone who can take the damage shield down right away.<p>I tended to agree with your comments until the last sentence.  I believe that there is no conclusively better weapon type without considering the situation...regardless of abstract delay considerations (your first point) or abstract damage considerations (your second point).<p>Even taking into account your qualifier of "But if the damages are in the same ballpark.." I would disagree with such a generalization.  There are times when even a slight difference...one that would be in the ballpark...is important.  <p>For example, if you're fighting something like a Spite Golem, it's going to be taken down by tank damage.  The casters are there to provide lag.  You need to put everything on it you can, and even an extra 10% (much less than the 50% noted) can make a difference in the fight.<p>Just some further thoughts...<br>
