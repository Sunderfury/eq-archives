I am wondering about this however. AC is just a number that we know is made up of two components.  Damage Mitigation and Damage Avoidance.  Is there any evidence that Agi may affect avoidance more than we know?  Has anyone done tests on average damage taken with varying levels of agility?<p><br>: While I could only do AGI upto 95 or 100 on my chat (look for it on the home page) the only really important number for AGI is 75. There is a huge jump from 74 to 75. There are no others that we know about. <p>: As I recall (and this is going back a bit) compairing the ACs of a bunch of 50th warriors, while naked, the differance from a 75 agi to a 125 agi was 9 points of AC. <p>: I would have to strongly disagree with your friends assessment of agi. I have been happy with Kailyn's stats and she spread points in Str, Stm, Dex and Agi as I recall. I think I would have put a few more points in Dex if I had to do it over again. <p>: To spend you strating points I would suggest imagining what your warrior will be like and then spend the points to mold her into that vision. Remember that gnome warriors are as good as barb warrior, showing that stats do not have a strong influance on performance.<p>
