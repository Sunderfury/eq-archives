: I would like to get your attention about 2 hand slashing and the damage among weapons of Norrath. 

: If you watch the highly experienced adventures of this land you rarely see anyone choosing this form of combat. Even the holy and the shadow knights how can only equip one smaller weapon choose to use the one handed slashing weapon favor of the bigger twohander.

: &lt;b&gt;There is a statistical problem with the min-damage calculation used for all weapons.  Basically, it made low damage low delay weapons of a given ratio much more preferrable than a high damage-high delay weapon. We're going to look into enhancing the amount of damage done with 2H weapons versus 1H weapons. 

: - Gordon&lt;/b&gt;

: You would almost think he had stopped by ;)
