Just curious, but has anyone done an analysis of the effect of AC compared to damage/delay?  This site has a great, detailed breakdown of the effects of damage and delay ratings, but basically nothing on the effects of AC.<p>This is important when trying to examine a weapon, like the Gnoll Hide Lariet or Slain Unicorn Shield, that gives you an AC bonus.  Especially in cases where you're not expecting to do much damage in the fight either way, but are very concerned about your ability to absorb damage, a weapon which gives you an AC boost is more important that a weapon that does good damage.  Looking at damage alone seriously underestimates the value of these weapons.
