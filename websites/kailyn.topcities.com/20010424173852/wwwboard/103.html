This was obvious to anyone who used two different weapon types.  Especially when the secondary weapon was faster.  The secondary weapon would hit first.<p>So, in effect he tells us nothing we didnt know.  Now information on how ac works would be much more interesting.  I hope they go past the obvious, that there are two ac values summed up for the ac sum shown in inventory.  <p>btw with my ashenbone axe I'm now doing base 15.  People are telling me they are seeing different base damage with different weapons.  So I'm interested in what your mithril 2h is doing.  I'm also doing alot more big hits and crits, but that could have been just luck so far.<p>Apparently the reason for the change was that a number of weapons in Kunark are 2h.  Also with people going up in levels the disparity became to large.
