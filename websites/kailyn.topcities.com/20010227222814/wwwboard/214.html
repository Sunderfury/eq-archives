Looks like there are still some significant gaps in our knoledge. (And I am mostly collecting the stuff that is out there, and then maybe trhow out an idea, most of this is done by other.) Looks like we were wrong about DW percantages, and even the skill. In some good research (look a couple of posts down) it seems that the DW skill percantage is (skill +1)*5/400 not 600 as we thought.<p>There are 2 issues that make it very hard to figure out hit rates: Actaully determining the level of the mob and accuratly segragating that information so that you can analize it. Then is the fact that there may be raiation in ACs of mobs of the same level. Without seeing more of how the game works (from the inside) I am not sure this is something that we will ever be able to solve.<p>
