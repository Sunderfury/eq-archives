I've always played under the assumption that there was a 70 percent haste cap (not sure where I got that info from in the first place...I think an enchanter), wherein you could never achieve more than 70% haste (so, for example, mixing a Runed Bolster Belt or Cloak of Flames with Augmentation was not much worse than mixing them with Swift Like the Wind, due to the 70% haste cap).<p>But now someone I trust who seems to have inside information has come along and told me that this isn't how it works at all...there is no haste cap, but there are minimum weapon delays.  He said they were:<p>18 for Paladins and ShadowKnights<br>15 for Warriors<br>14 for Rangers<br>13 for Rogues<br>12 for Monks<p>If this is true, it changes the why I'm going to look at weapons.   For example, a jade mace is 9/18, which seems to make it one of the better one-handed weapons for Paladins.  But with the minimum delay info, it seems that i'll never get any benefit from haste with this weapon, so it's not very good after all.  A Darkmetal Sprinkler (16/29) will be able to do much more damage, because it's delay can get down to 18 for me using my Runed Bolster Belt and Augmentation.  Or, even better, my Fiery Avenger can get down to 18 delay with RBB and Augmentation too, I believe...so who cares that warriors get that crazy 19/20 staff, or rangers and their 14 delay whip?<p>Anybody else heard anything like this?  I've had one other enchanter friend confirm this as well (though he didn't know the exact minimum delays)...was wondering if anyone else had something to say about this?  Is it all BS, or is this the way it really works, and whoever figured out the 70% haste cap was actually seeing this behavior instead?
