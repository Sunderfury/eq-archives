: KINESTHETICS (Level 57): When using this discipline, all rolls for double attacks and dual wields will be successful, giving the rogue 4 attacks per round, guaranteed. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the rogue gains additional levels. 

: Of course some of that data doesn't make sense out of context, but it might give you an idea as to what we've been working on. 

: In the spirit of the additional information released by GZ concerning spells, here's a taste of some of the things that melee types can look forward to: 

: Warriors: Kicks with integral stuns! 
: Rogues: Full speed (think RUN) sneaking! 
: Monks: Regen HPs as if you were sitting, but while feigned! 
: There's more, and to be honest those aren't the best things we've done, but we're not prepared to come clean on it all just yet.
