It is 75+ but even if it were 76+ you would be still ok. there are PLENTY of good AC items out there that give some sort of dex bonus as well. lizardscale cloak is one of them, 8ac +5dex.<p>my warrior is lvl 44 only but even with best AC i could get my stats raise by 10-20 points just because of those small bonuses on items. so, dont worry, you are ok.<p>Nulak K`ven<br>vallon zek<p>: Hmmm just for clarification, is that MORE than 75 or is it 75 or more? <br>: I say this because, of course, I have a character with 75 AGI , and wouldn't wanna find out I made a broooookm-mistake consisting of 1 point of AGI.<p>: btw Great works you have here Kailyn and great work you're doing.  <p>
