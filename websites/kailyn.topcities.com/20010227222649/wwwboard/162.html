Let me say that 99% of the fight last longer than 10 rounds. Having all the info on the table i am just wondering whats the best combo to use.. 2 yaks kick ass with both procing for 75 damage... i was think using the Kunzar Ku'juch in my primry hand because it has better damage/delay and basically a 100 point proc. Bu tthen i think the green jaded braod sowrd with its BAD ASS damage/delay is the way to go, and it gives alot of stats. But then i think how much i proc, which is quit often so i am undecided. It realyl doesnt matter, i have neither a green jaded axe or a Kunzar Ku'juch at the moment, but i am just at work and bored... tell me what ya think about it..
