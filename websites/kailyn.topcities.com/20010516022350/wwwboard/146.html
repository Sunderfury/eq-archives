One thing that I have noticed is that there seems to be something effecting both damage delivered and damage taken based on the difference in levels between you and the mob.  This is very noticable at lower levels, as you have less hp to work with, and you level faster so stuff sticks in your mind better.<p>I started an Iksar monk to play with.  I picked a yellow mob (I was 5) and it kicked my butt.  It was almost dead too.  I fought the same mob as soon as I turned 6 (no skill increases yet, and using kick instead of roundd kick), and beat it easily (3 bub health remaining).<p>This is totally unscientific.  I could have just gotten a really good run on the random number generator, which, with EQ's RN is extremely possible, but my 50 warrior has noticed the same thing too, although not as drastic.<p>opinions?
