: I'm 52 as well, and use Monsoon (2h slash dam 30 speed 45 effect: haste).  My minimum hit is 15, max with full buffs is 149, and magic number is 75.

: With dual wield my minumum hit in my prime hand is 9, with the offhand it is 1.

: Another story -- fighting in Chardok last week w/ me using Monsoon + augment and a ranger friend dual weilding a barbed scale whip (prime hand) and revultant whip (off hand) + augment.  Our cleric finally asked me if I had a spare 2h weapon to give the ranger since I was unable to taunt off him with Monsoon.

: With the improved damage bonus and the addition of lots of great new weapons, 2h can now match (and even exceed in some cases) overall damage output of dual wield.  It still suffers though from lack of consistency -- one slash with Monsoon I may crit for 220, but then fail to connect on any swing for 15 seconds.  Dual wield, by allowing you to swing much much more often, puts out consistent damage, creating a greater taunt factor.

: The two hand vs. one hand debate for total damage output is fairly moot these days, but dual wield still wins hands down for taunting.
