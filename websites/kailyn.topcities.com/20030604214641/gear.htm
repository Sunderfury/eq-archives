Ok, ok...so this document is a just a little bit out of date. I did not updated it on the day I finally got any number of loots, like my Indo BP (banked!!)..something that I decided I wanted the day I saw it posted to EQ'Lizer oh so long ago when all planear armor dropped in Fear, becuase there was no Hate. Or when I got anything else. In the 15 months since I last updated this document I think both RoK and SoV have come out. As you might guess both my level and my gear have been improved. Also I no longer have the knowledge of gear drops that I once did. But certantly you can see how I make my dicisions. I have an updated <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16294>profile</a>, over at <a href=http://www.magelo.com>Magelo</a>. The AC seems to be off by one point. I will double check things.<BR><BR>

My gear. This seems to be a popular question on the board and gives a good opportunity to show my philosophy about gear in EQ. I believe that the single most important stat for warriors is Armor Class (AC). The way EQ is set up warriors will almost never be the main damage doers in the party. We are there, as some put it, to be ugly sponges. It is our role in this game to keep the mobs hitting us and off the casters. While damage does play an important role in this (out have to be able to piss off a mob enough that it attacks you) being better able to shrug off that damage is even more important. Also, currently I am low on resistance gear for occasions like dragon hunting. This will not include Idilocite as recommended gear. Of course if you do have Idilocite, use it! <BR><BR>

<b>Head:</b> I have Indilocite now! WOOP. Traded my SSB to a needing bard. I will probably buy anyother one when I get back to Norath. Skull Shaped Barbute 13 AC 10 MR 35 HP. While not the highest AC it is within 1 point of crafted, and has the benefits of 35 HP and 10 magic resistance. The 35 HP probably makes up for the 1 point of AC and +10 MR is gravy. Common drop off the ghoul lord in Lower Guk. Other good choices: Crafted Helm and Crown of the Froglok Kings (excellent fire and cold resistance). Overrated: Executioner’s Hood. As pointed out by Elldog McBain I forgot one of the best helms out there: the Hammerhead Helm. AC 13 + 7 Strength and Stamina.<BR><BR>

<b>Face:</b> Grotesque Mask (3 AC & dex -9 chr). There are currently no outstanding choices for the face. The Dented Brass Mask is nice (4 AC +3 Str). An excellent choice pointed out to me by Alewuf, the Splitpaw Hide Mask. Going to get one for myself. It is 3 AC +5 Magic and Poison Resistance. For special resistance occasions you can always use a golden diamond mask with all of its resistances. Overrated: Jewelry that only gives stat bonuses.<BR><BR>

<b>Ears:</b>2 x Golden Topaz 3 AC 8 disease. I have been very happy with these. They have good AC and a nice resistance boost. Along with all that they are cheap! Other good choices: Diamondine Earrings 2 AC 3 str 12 HP and Silver Black Sapphire Earrings: 2 AC 35 HP and 25 Mana, Ivaners Hoop 6 AC, Int and Wis (could be particularly useful with the new skill caps). Again from Alewuf come the choice of the Obsidian Bead Hoop (AC2 3 Agi and Int). I disagree with Alewul and think it is for Erudish Shadow Knights and Paladins, who start with a 70 Agility Overrated: Silver Sapphire Earrings.<BR><BR>

<b>Neck:</b> Steel Collar 6 AC as I recall. There are any number of good choices for the next (since there are no outstanding choices for the neck). I would say the most popular is the Runed Lava Pendent. At 5 AC 6 str 5 fire resistance it is worth the 1 point of AC. As is the inexpensive Collar of Undead Protection (5 AC 7 vs disease and poison). Over rated: player made jewelry (sorry enchanters) especially the golden  black pearl choker. Drool: Polished Mithril Torque (7 Ac 13 int and wis) would be great to have but Paladins, SKs and Ragners should have first shot.<BR><BR>

<b>Shoulders:</b> Crafted Pauldrons 12 AC +2 Str and magic resistance. The greatest thing about magic shoulders is that it lets large races bash magic only creatures. The Bloodstained Mantle is not bad either. Crested Spaulers are not a bad choice either. For Paladins the Adimantite Epaulets may be worth the hit. I don't know how hybrid mana works so I can not say anything stronger than that. The only shoulders that are over rated are the Carnal Pauldrons. You give up too much AC for that dex.<BR><BR>

<b>Arms:</b> Indilocite now! 20 AC +9 Str +5 Dex. Callili got my Mithril Vembraces (10 AC 7 str 5 magic resistance) when I won the arms. This is one of the few Mithril items I will wear. They are barely worth the lost of 2 AC. The only thing that saves them is the 5 MR. Best choice is probably the Crafted. I would say these are equal to the Azure Sleeves, assuming that AC is AC and the fact that the sleeves are cloth has no adverse effects on the damage you take. No real bad choices here.<BR><BR> 

<b>Wrists:</b> 2 Crafted Bracers: 10 AC 2 dex and 2 int. Actually I credit the crafted braces with giving me my last 2 points of defense. The day the patch went though giving the bracers +2 int I got defense finally shot up to 210. Good AC. The other good choice is the Hero Bracers (9 AC 10 str 5 poison and disease). Good returns for 1 point of AC. Eventually I will do this quest. Overrated: Serpentine Bracers with 1 AC these are probably the single most over use piece of gear in the game. Try and sell them so you at least get some plat for them. <BR><BR>

<b>Hands:</b> Crafted Gauntlets 12 AC 5 Str (forgot the stat bonus). These are really the only game in town for warriors. Rarely will you find them wearing anything else. Good choice for hybrids: Dark Mail Gauntlets AC 10 +5 Dex and 50 mana.<font color=blue> A good suggestion from Kevin: Kedgemail gauntlets AC11 +3 str +5 dex +25 mana, great for hybrids and shamans, warriors casters and other priests can't wear.</font><BR><BR>

<b>Fingers:</b> 1 Jagged Band 5 AC 3 str and 1 Platinum Fire Opal Ring 5 AC 55 HP. If I could have all the plat I spent on rings back...Both the Jagged Band and the Plat Fire Opal Rings are excellent choices. Good AC, and personally I would take the HP over the strength (and will if I ever get a second Plat Fire Opal). Another interesting choice are the silver or gold Jacinth rings. Overrated: Silver or platinum fire emerald and the plat black pearl rings. I found out that Fire Opals can be gotten in the Temple of Solusek Ro from Genni for 55 plat (I have not done this but friends and guild mates have). 
<BR><BR>

<b>Back:</b> Lizard Scale Cloak 8 AC 5 dex. Not great but the next step up is a doosy. Another good choice is the Cloak of the Icebear with is cold resistance. Picked up a Cloak of the Icebear myself this weekend. I like having the extra resists. Stepping up in the luck department are Cloak of Shadows 12 AC 13 dex 10 poison (rare drop off a rare spawn in SolB) and the Hooded Black Cloak 10 AC 5 Str 45 HP (off the Dampire in Mistmoore I think).<BR><BR>

<b>Chest:</b> Enameled Black Chestplate 25 AC! Great peice of armor and I get 40 AC from wearing it. The other good choice is the Crafted BP at 22 AC 5 Stm and 25 HP. Overrated: Mithril BP. The Agility and HP bonuses don’t come anywhere near making up for its low AC. The only people who should even consider wearing this are tanks with Agility less than 75. And they should consider something else to make up the agility strongly. <BR><BR>

<b>Belt:</b> Thick Banded Belt: 8 AC 15 strength. I like it. I will swap it out for a Flowing Black Silken Sash when I get one. (15% more damage is more than enough of a boost to loose all the AC.) I got a FBSS (a friend quit the game and gave me his SMR to trade for it. I miss the AC of the TBB. Mr. Rhoads points out that I missed a great option in the Swerlspine Belt, with is 10% haste effect (or so) and  4 AC. A nice compromise between the TBB and FBSS. At lower levels (maybe even below 20) you should get a Thick Leather Apron (8 AC) and use that until you can get a TBB or FBSS.<BR><BR>

<b>Legs:</b> Crafted Greaves 14 AC 1 Str 2 Fire and Cold. Less AC than the Steel Kilt (large only 15 AC) by one these are the best choice until you can get Indilocite Legs (good luck). Mithril Greaves 10 AC 7 Str and 5 MR (same as the arms) aren't bad but are just this side of marginal. Overrated: Silver Plated Greaves 10 AC 5 Str 3 Agi give up the AC of crafted without giving you the MR of the Mithril.<BR><BR>

<b>Feet:</b> I have Indilocite Boots! Sold the Crafted Boots 12 AC 5 Agility. These are the best everything else is overrated. <BR><BR>
