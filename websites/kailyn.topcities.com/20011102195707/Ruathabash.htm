If you use the keyboard to navigate your way through Norrath, it's very easy to switch out a shield for your offhand weapon, bash, then switch the weapon back into your offhand. Here's a tutorial I wrote a while back, with visual aids:<BR><BR>
<img src=http://www.erols.com/aburner/eq/bash01.jpg><BR><BR>

 

Note my hotkey bank. The top row is Taunt and Bash. The 2nd row is my Primary and Secondary weapon slots. The 3rd row is two inventory slots.<BR><BR>

Note that a shield is attached to the mouse pointer. Note that the mouse pointer is over the secondary weapon slot. Note that the Bash button is depressed. (We've got it in therapy, though... :) )<BR><BR>

Note here the crucial step. The Bash button has cycled, and I have clicked the mouse button to swap out the shield for the secondary weapon (a Dragoon Dirk in this case).<BR><BR>

From here you simply hit the Bash button and then click the mouse again to swap out the dirk for the shield.<BR><BR>

And voila: Every warrior who dual-wields gains the ability to Bash. With practice, you won't even miss a beat. (My problem is that sometimes I'll get click-happy and switch the dirk for the shield, then back...and then back again, so I'm just wielding the primary weapon and the shield.)<BR><BR>

With a few extra clicks, you can even bash while wielding a 2-hander. However, it's very difficult to do it in such a way that you don't miss a swing, and it's also easier to drop either your weapon or your shield. On the bright side, you'll usually increase your Hand-to-hand skill if you do this often enough. :)<BR><BR>

In any event, if you use the keyboard to navigate through Norrath, this technique is extremely easy and useful. If you're used to using the mouse to navigate, this will probably be something of a challenge for you.<BR><BR>

Thanks Ruatha. Ruatha's page is <a href=http://www.erols.com/aburner/eq>here</a> I think.<BR><BR>
