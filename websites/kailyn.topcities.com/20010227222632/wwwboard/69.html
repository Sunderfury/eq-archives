If you're fighting something that you can hit with the proc, I agree wholeheartedly.  Even at a 50% resist rate, dual Yaks edge out dual Waks.  However, when you hit a 60% resist rate, they are even.  Beyond that, the Waks are better. (All of this is my opinion, backed by a few calculations, of course.)<p>So, it depends upon the anticipated resistance rate which to use (assuming you have the luxury of both).  For general purposes, I'd choose the Yak because I believe that you can hit most MOBs with the proc, even most planar MOBs.<p>However, if you know you're tackling Cleric houses in Hate or some other very resistant MOB, it seems to me that you'd switch in the Wak.<p>BTW, I don't think this applies to just Waks.  The Amygdalan Tendril is another debated weapon.  It's better than a Yak without procs, but not as good as a Yak with procs.  I tend to use a Yak in my primary hand and the Tendril in my off-hand.  But, if we've got a Spite Golem or Cleric running at us, I just bring up inventory and flip them--only takes a second.<p>Just an opinion...<p>*grin*
