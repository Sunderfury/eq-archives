Hey fool, you should have asked me. Ok, from what i noticed as long as your dex is about 75 your yak will proc pretty much the same. the more dex you have, the better but dont lose AC over dex. i think i have like 105 dex unbuffed and my yak procs quite a bit in a fight. like 2-4 times depending on the duration of the fight. yes, when you have those shaman buffs that give you crazy ammount of dex you will proc a lot more but dont lose AC over dex. if you get a buff, great, if not, then dont worry about it. so, to answer your question, no i dont know what the dex/proc foruma is but i know you should not lose AC over dex.<p>Nulak K`ven<br>vallon zek<p>: from all the info i have gathered once your stats go beyond 200 there is no HUGE benefit  it is a soft cap.... so with that stated does anyone know the formula for procs and dex? I mean i have been thinking dex is the best stat to raise simply because i have 200 str buffed, so i am getting no more benefits from that, and i belive that the best weapons in the game existing and yet to be will have procs.  So i feel dex is prolly the best stat to buff, i mean whats and extra point in agility gunna do compared to the chance of having your weapon proc once more,   i mean even a yak 75 damage is enuff to raise dex.  So my original question... how much does dex effect the procs  please post replies with any opinions or info or test... thanx.<p><br>: Borys Smells <br>: vallon Zek<br>: Xanit K'ven<p>
