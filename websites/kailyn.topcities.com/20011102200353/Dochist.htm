<center><font face=arial>Document history</center><BR><BR>

<b>3/21/00</b><BR>Added document history page.<BR>
Used Word on the existing pages to correct my wonderful spelling. <BR>
Added to the melee faq.<BR><BR>

<b>3/29/00</b><br>
Added the skill cap chart. Boy tables may be easy but they are time consuming with big ones like that!<BR><BR>

<b>3/31/00</b><br>
Added a hit counter. Just curious to see how many people hit the site.<BR><BR>

<b>4/12/00</b><BR>
Corrected editorial comment on the melee skill chart. Added Indilocite Helm to my gear. With the boots that is 2 down.<BR><BR> 

<b>7/26/00</b><br>
Beseen seems to have messed up my counter and I went by their history to reset it where it should. Also I picked up indilocite arms sometime while I was on hiatus from the site. I also took about 2 months off from EQ. I am back now. I need to add the arms to my equipment list.<BR><BR>

<b>7/27/00</b><BR>
Finally added some content to the links page. Wahoo! Links for Wolf Hounds (my guild), Copelands Weapon Calculator and EQ Parse.<BR><BR>

<b>10/23/01</b><BR>
Well it has been a bit of time but I updated my Current Gear section with my Magelo profile.
