As some of you know I play a 50/51/52 Monk depending on the time of the day ;-p.  I was experimenting with equipment yesterday and found some interesting things and was curious if it worked out the same way with warriors.  As we all know Agility = 1/3 of a ac point.  ie 3agi = 1 ac point.  I was playing with str equipment yesterday and found that 2 str = 1 ac point.  My thought is that with STR affecting AC in a positive manner more efficiently then AGI does I am starting to swap my ac/agi equipment for AC/STR equipment to allow a little higher damage cap.  I guess my question is do warriors and other tanks see the same coralation between str and ac?  Or is it just a monk thing.  Currently I am a 51 monk 987 ac unbuffed with 140 ac 120 agi and 100 dex.  Dex Also seemed to play a part in AC but still trying to figure out the optimum solution.  I personally would rather have the higher damage cap.
