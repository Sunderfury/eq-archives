Also, I have seen posts by people who were in the early Betas.  They say that your ATK value used to be divided into two numbers:<p>Hit % / Damage<p>IE, one number was a measure of your ability to hit, the other was a measure of how much damage you could do.<p>Strength raised the Damage number.<p>But, at some point, they decided that the two number setup was too complicated, and instead changed it to one number, with an arbitrary "/ 1000".  This was to avoid confusion. :)<p>Since we have seen in tests how much Str actually raises damage (someone said 100 Str was about 1 more point average damage per hit?), I think it is safe to say warrior classes should only really worry about the To Hit part of the ATK value.  And that part is not effected by Str.
