<textarea name="body" COLS=50 ROWS=10>
: One thing that seems to be a bit unclear at the moement is the affect of STR on the distribution of damage.

: Now Brad's statement on the EQ board said that STR affected 'maximum and average' damage. 

: Now obviously, raising the maximum will affect the average, but that is a bit of a strange way to put it, if there is only that one effect.

: Now, presumably everyone agrees that there is an effect of level (in some way) on average damage, in that a level 50 is more likely to hit for average or better damage when fighting a decaying skeleton than than they are when fighting Vox.

: This is different from the chance to hit, which from both logging and Brad's statements seems to be strictly level/skill based.

: Now, in theory, if you give any credence to the ATK numbers, each level gets you about 30 ATK points from skills. 
: So, again, purely from theory, you would expect 60 STR to be the equivalent of 2 levels.

: So if you take this theory seriously, you can predict several things:

: - a level one troll warrior will have the same 
:   damage distribution as a level 3 gnome warrior.

: - a level 11 barbarian rogue will have a 
:   higher average damage, when they hit, than a 
:   level 12 dark elf rogue.

: - a level 17 barbarian rogue will do about the 
:   same average damage as a level 19 gnome rogue.

: - a level 34 paladin with a +60 STR buff will have 
:   the same damage distribution (ignoring the 
:   fixed level bonus) as a level 36 paladin.

: Now, the first three cases seem to match up, but I don't have a paladin high enough to test the last. 
: Those who have run such tests say +60 STR makes a barely detectable difference.

: You might think this would blow my theory out of the water. But there is a way to save it.

: Does 2 levels make a detectable difference in the 30's or higher?

: In other words, if you look at the ratios of min/magic/max hits for the same character 2 levels apart, can you detect a statistically significant difference?
: Obviously, you have to compensate for any changes in the fixed (level -25)/3 bonus. 

: If this is true, it would reverse the current recieved wisdom that STR is irrelevant until level 20, when the max damage bonus kicks in. 
: Instead, STR would be king up to about level 20, gradually becoming insignificant afterwards, for the same reasons that the grouping and con ranges expand to cover more levels.
