<font face=arial size=+2><b>EQ Melee FAQ</b></font></center><BR><BR>
<font face=arial>Guess I have to start somewhere<BR><BR>
<b>1. Who is this FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for?</b><RB><BR>
It is primarily intended for those interested in the melee aspects of
Everquest. It applies most to Warriors and then to a lesser degree to all of the other melee classes: Paladins, Shadow Knights, Rogue, Ranges, Monks and Bards. <BR><BR>

<b>2. What is my EQ experience?</b><BR><BR>
Well my primary character, Kailyn Longstride of Povar is a 50th level warrior. She has over 80 days played. I started her on 3/21/99, within a week of release. I have seen a lot of the changes to EQ and the Warrior class. I am familiar with most of the stuff warriors need to know. I also participate extensively on the EQ Stratics Warrior board (the most active class board I have found for warriors) and other boards trying to find out more about the system.<BR><BR>

<b>3. Why are you doing this?</b><BR><BR>

Frankly I like playing with numbers and figuring out how stuff works. Not everyone does, nor should everyone have to go though the pain I did to find out key information.<BR><BR>

<font size=+1><b>Stats and Race</b></font><BR><BR>

<b>4. How did you spend your starting attributes?</b><BR><BR>

At the same time I bought EQ I bought the hint book. (Don't buy the hint book it is a waste of money, wrong, and incomplete. Between the documentation in the game and the hint book there is barely enough information to play the game. The best source of information is the web.) I had read the hint book and decided that all the stats sounded important. In the end I ended up with a 120 Strength, 110 Stamina, 95 Agility and 75 Dex. I am fairly happy with all the choices.<BR><BR>

<b>5. How important is the choice of race?</b><BR><BR>

Six months after the game came out I would have call you crazy for being
anything other than a large race warrior. With what we have learned since then I can say you should choose the race you will have the most fun with. Since the stats have little effect on the power of the class starting race is less critical than it was. I still like barbarian warriors, but the weak seeming gnome Gem Choppers are at least 95% as effective as one of the 'powergamer' choices for warriors.<BR><BR>

<b>6. What about this slam thing?</b><BR><BR>

Large races (troll, ogre and barbarian) get the ability to slam their opponents without using shields. This can be very handy and gives a slight edge to the large race warriors. Other warriors can do this if they have a shield equipped. I will dig up a guide by a friend, Ruatha, for how to bash with the smaller races. Suffice it to say you can make up for not being a large race fairly easily.<BR><BR>

<b>7. I still need to spend these starting stat points. What should I do with them?</b><BR><BR>

Well I will leave that decision to you but I will tell you what the stats do.<BR><BR>
<b>Strength</b>  I seem to recall from one of the manuals a quote that if we have ever played a Role Playing Game before we will know what strength does. Umm, <font color=red>NO</font> Strength has no great effect on the warrior. (Get used to the phrase.) The most useful application of strength for warriors is that it lets us haul more loot and carry heavier armor. It has a small effect on how hard you can hit something and a tiny, tiny effect on your average damage. <BR><BR>

<b>Stamina</b> Well for this on one I can give a concrete answer. Stamina gives you 1 HP for ever 11 points of stamina per level. You may not see the benefits of stamina until high level. At 40th plus a warrior will have<BR><BR>

<center>HP = Level * (27 + stm/11)</center><BR><BR>

This means that a warrior with 110 stamina will have 1850 HP and one with a 99 stamina (11 less) will have 1800. Stamina does not have any other major effects that are know at this time. Apparently Paladins (and SK??) have HP= Level * (23 + stm/13).<BR><BR>

<b>Dexterity</b> Dexterity has small effects on 2 things that concern warriors, and one that concerns most other melee classes. The warrior's chance to score a critical hit is partially determined by his dexterity. In my opinion (and there is a lot of my opinion in this document) critical hits are nothing more than eye candy. They may give you a warm fuzzy but that is about all they do. I do not believe that it is worth maximizing dexterity for critical hits. Dex also affects the chance of a magical weapons having its magical effects go off. Again Dex's effect on this is small, though I would recommend having a dex above 75 if you have a weapon that procs. Dex has no effect on to hit or damage for melee or Duel Wield or Double Attack. (It does play some role in archery and thrown, but both skills are of limited usefulness.)<BR><BR>

<b>Agility</b> Well I think the graph more or less sums up the effect of
agility. Above 75 it has no great effect on anything, though there is a small bonus to AC occasionally. It is critical if you are starting a melee character that you have an agility of 75 or higher. There is rumored to be another increase in AC at 160 or so but for most warriors that is out of reach. Even with the bonus AC at that level you would likely have to sacrifice more AC than you would get back. A test we did showed that at 50th level, naked (no armor) a warrior with a 75 Agi has an AC of 569. A 50th warrior with a 125 Agi in the same situation has a 580 AC. A 50 point change in Agi produces an 11 point change in AC. Hardly worth it. Testing and statements by Verant show that Agi has no effect on Dodge, Parry, Riposte, or any other combat skill. <BR><BR>

So much for stats. For both race and class you should go with the combination that seems most interesting and fun to play. <BR><BR>

<b><font size=+1>General</font></b><br><br>

<b>8. What can I expect as a warrior?</b><br><br>

I would say there are 3 distinct stages to a warrior's life: new, mix and shield bearer. In each stage the warrior goes though the class strengths and weaknesses become more apparent. <BR><BR>

In the new stage, lasting to level 15 or so, a warrior can spend a lot of time soloing. The damage output will be equal to other classes and most every character will still melee when you group. These levels go by quickly. While you have an advantage in skill cap and hit point these will not really be apparent even when compared to pure casters. You don’t need to worry about gear now, though if you can get a magical weapon as wisps, which are common though out Norrath, are good XP and money until they green out at 12th or so. Usually piercing weapons are the cheapest around. If you don’t have magical weapons, DON'T WORRY. At such low levels Verant does not expect you to have them and you see few magical creatures unless you go out of your way to find the. <BR><BR>

<b>Mix</b> Middle life as it were. You will notice that you start having significant HP advantages over casters, along with and AC advantage. Personally Kailyn did not get her first piece of banded armor (at a deal price of 35 plat no less) until 15th level. I have heard may warriors saying they are behind the curve because they are not in bronze at this point. It was not until I was in the mid 20's that I started to get bronze armor. At these levels your contribution to the group is about equal parts damage and defense. A warrior’s innate Magic Resistance starts making a real difference. It is also in this stage that you have to learn what your real purpose in the group is: protecting others. While you still can deal out reasonable amounts of damage by hand you should learning how to protect your group mates.<BR><BR>

<b>Shield bearer</b> The late levels of a warrior carrier are not days of Conan slashing your way though pile of monsters (as much as I wished it was). At this point to operate you need to be grouped with other players. You are the defensive tank of the group. At the highest levels in balanced groups warrior will rarely amount for more than 10% of the damage done to a mob. This does not mean you are useless to the group. The damage you do can be important. But you have an even more important job: to stand between the monsters and the casters. The casters are big damage dealers, glass cannons as I call them. They hit hard but are about as resilient as fine bone china. Your armor class naked will be more than the fully dress armor class of many casters. Here our extra hit points and magic resistance defines the class. On good days we are the protectors of the group. On bad days we are meat shields or ugly sponges (ugly sponge = pisses monsters off and absorbs damage).<BR><BR>

<b>9. What weapons skills should I train?</b><BR><BR>

Well ideally you should train all of them. Realistically warriors will end up  only using 2 types of weapons: 1 handed slashing and 2 handed slashing. I picked up piercing at an early level (13th or so) because they were cheap magic weapons. This paid off nicely when I late got a Shield of the Slain Unicorn. While not a great weapon unto itself it let me work my dex (when I had only one Ykesha) and not sacrifice armor or too much offence. While it would be great to train in all the weapon skills at this point there are just not enough alternative weapons that are the same quality as the 1 and 2 handed slashing weapons.<BR><BR>

<b>10. What weapons should I use?</b><BR><BR>

A hard question to answer. I would say once you are out of you lowest levels you should always have at least 2 1 handed slashing and 1 2 handed slashing. The most important factor in your weapon choice (besides what you can lay your hands on) is your level. Starting about 25th melee types get a minimum hit with weapons in their primary hand. The effect is most important at high levels where the minimum damage can be a good solid hit with a weapon. Really the best answer is to plug in the numbers you have for your own character and use the melee damage formula. The other important note is that if you are grouping with an Enchanter or Bard who are mesmerizing mobs do not use area effect weapons (like the Painbringer and Fleshripper). The added effectiveness of the group is more than worth the sacrifice of these weapons.<BR><BR>

<b>11. What about kick?</b><BR><BR>

I have some strong opinions on kick, especially considering Kailyn is a barbarian and can slam. If you are one of the large races (troll, ogre, barbarian) while you should train kick, it should not be used nearly as often as bash. At low to mid levels kick will out damage slam (or bash) but you still get other benefits from slam or bash. The other reason to keep kick trained for a while is magic creatures. Though you are likely to get magic shoulder first, if you get blackened iron boots (crafted and indilocite too) you can kick magical creatures. It can be useful especially if you are bashing by switching weapons (see <a href=http://www.topcities.com/VideoGames/kailyn/Ruathabash.htm>Ruatha’s Guide to Bashing</a>). <BR><BR>

<b>12. What about bashing?</b><BR><BR>

You should always be nice to the other players. Don’t bash them ;). Bashing requires that you have a shield equipped in your off hand. Not much of a sacrifice before you get duel wield but at high levels this can be a significant hindrance. Bashing, while starting with lower damage than kick has 3 major advantages over kick and eventually will out damage kick. Number one it is very good at interrupting mobs who are casting. (Unlike player casters who are interrupted by any decent hit, mob casters are very good at casting though regular melee.) Number two bashing has a chance to stun creatures so that they do not move or attack for a couple of seconds. You can even make them do a slow spin if you get lucky, just like they seem to do to us all the time. Number three bash has a higher skill cap than kick until 50th (this is pre-Kunark). Bash caps at 200 while kick at 140 or so.<BR><BR>

<b>13. What about slam?</b><BR><BR>

Slam is a large race’s biggest advantage. Because of their size trolls, ogres and barbarians can bash, that is slam without a shield. When you get the bash skill (6th level as I recall for warriors) train a single point into it and then slam your little heart out.  Slam uses your bashing skill so that while slamming you will increase your bashing skill and us your bashing skill level in to hit and damage checks. This has all the advantages of slam without any of the disadvantages. To slam magical creatures while using a 2 handed weapon you need to have magical shoulders. (This was a nice little change that Verant made, it used to be you could not slam magical creatures while using a 2 handed weapon.)<BR><BR>

<b>14. What about Critical Hits and Crippling Blows?</b><BR><BR>

These are mostly eye candy. They will rarely amount to real significant damage in combat. You do get that nice message that you scored a critical (or crip) when it happens. That is about it. Your rate of Crits is effected by your dex. A crippling blow is happens when you score a crit while you are berserk. Critical hits have a range of 2x weapon damage +1 to about 4 times weapon damage. There is a bonus added to crits up to your Minimum hit (level-25/3). I think that crippling blows have a higher range of damage but Verant as made some changes to crippling blows and I am very rarely berserk in combat.<BR><BR>

<b>15. What is Berserk?</b><BR><BR>

Berserk is the first ability Verant gave warriors after release. There were complaints that warriors had the same skill caps as rangers (they snuck in the +5 offense and defense sometime afterward) without any of the advantages. Berserk is time when either you need some big time healing from the cleric or your group should run. In game terms it add to your attack and strength (at 50th I get about 40 points of attack). Most importantly it stops the death march (the period of very slow movement when you are so hurt that your agility starts to drop). The anti-death march properties make berserk great. <BR><BR>

<b>16. What is Duel Wield and how does it work?</b><BR><BR>

Duel Wield (or DW for short) is the ability to use 2 1 handed weapons at the same time. Until you get DW you can not equip the Shield of the Slain Unicorn. The skill for warriors caps at 200. One of the few formulas that Verant has release for the combat system your chance to successfully DW is (level + skill)/600. <BR><BR>

Our current understanding of DW is that every delay of the off hand (or delay/10 seconds) the server checks your DW skill. If the check is successful  then a regular to hit check is made. The weapon in your primary hand has no effect on the off hand. Stats have no effect on the chance to DW. Double Attack checks are made for the off hand when you get that skill.<BR><BR>

<b>17. What is Double Attack and how does it work?</b><BR><BR>

Double Attack (DA) is the other skill for which we have a formula. It is easier to DA than it is to DW. The formula is (skill + level)/500.  DA caps at 205 for warriors. Again notice that there are no other factors that affect your chance to DA. DA can and does work on both hands so that you can get 4 attacks in one set of delay. At low levels just to get 4 attacks (and this does not include to hit) your odds are very low (less than 1 in 1,000). At high levels you will see 4 attacks around about 10% of the time. Again though this does not take into account your chance to hit.
