I know the basic drill.  Str doesn't mean crap, and most of the other melee stats mean just as little.  And Dex only effects procs.<p>But, I am hoping to settle an argument.  How *much* does Dex effect procs?  Is there a Min value on it like there is on Agil?<p>Personally I don't weild a procing weapon, as an SK.  But there are warriors and rangers in my guild who are now debating the merits of losing some AC in exchage for some Dex.  The deciding factor will be how much more it makes that Yak proc... so I want to know if there is any data.<p>I thought I had heard that it was not a very large effect.  Can anyone give numbers?  Mins not to go below(like the 75 Agil)?  Differences in proc rates between, say, a 100 and a 130?<p>Thanks!
