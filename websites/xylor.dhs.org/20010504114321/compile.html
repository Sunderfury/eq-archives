<p>In order to compile OpenQuest you will need the ACE library.  This can
be found at <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">
http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html</a>.  The version currently being 
used for development is 5.1.14.
<p>OpenQuest is being developed on <a href="http://www.linux.org">
Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> distribution (woody), 
<a href="http://www.kernel.org">kernel</a> version 2.4.3.
Although the scripts included in the source tar.gz file are for UN*X, it *should* compile
correctly under Win32 with ACE installed correctly.  If anyone gets this to compile 
under Win32 please let me know, as I don't have time at the moment to test this.
<p>For UN*X, once you get the latest ACE library installed, it should just be a 
matter of running ./configure, and make.
<p>As of April 8, 2001, the Login Server is still being worked on, so there is not much
to actually 'see' at this point (although you can get to the server selection screen
by pointing your eqhosts.txt file to the machine running the login server, port 10002).
<p>If you have any question, please contact me at
