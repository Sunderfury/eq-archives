I've played my pally up to 58 and got tired of waiting hours for a group, plus Half-Elf plate graphics are kinda weak.
Anyway, my Vah-Shir Bard (heavily-twinked) is lvl 25 and I know how to song twist and such. But, I am confused on what swarm kiting is, AoE kiting, charm kiting. These are a bit confusing to me. Except for AoE Kiting, I have a lvl 47 druid and kite Walruses non-stop. So....could someone explain what and how to do all these Bard Kites. Also, DDD and Cod, do very little damage, I'm guessing that these kites last a while.

Thank you

Well after level 24 and PC i went to Iceclad Ocean to kill all kinds of cougars and what not i could get my grubby hands on and when i hit 33 altho it was SWEET exp still i was wondering if any one could tell me where to hit next.

I prefer to AE solo on the bard mainly becuase it gets me massive amounts of EXP, an adrenolin rush, and great fun. Im looking for a zone that has a few mobs but that i wont need to run from one half of the zone to the other to get that good EXP.

Does any one have any suggestions for me?

You can target yourself and play Song of Highsun and it will act much like a Succor spell, teleporting you to the point that you zoned in at as your 'spawn point'.  There is a mild debuff that goes along with that but hey, I can live with that if it means instant port to the zone in for a quick escape or to get out of a jam I like was in.</description></item><item><title>Pulling unlullable mobs.</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/635748/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2004 21:22:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:635748</guid><dc:creator>Bakanar</dc:creator><slash:comments>16</slash:comments><description>This is by no means revolutionary or even original but it's a tactic I came up with on the fly the other day in PoV.  I'm sure others have done this so I'm not going to name it after myself or anything stupid like that but it worked well and I figured I'd share.

I was in PoV helping a friend kill guys for Sacred Water and in the first house there are two guard pops.  Usually these two guards are 65 and lullable for single pulls, they're also slowable so when they start hitting your tank for 500 a pop a single cleric can keep up on the heals.  Well there's a rare spawn guard, he's a short little bastard, half the size of the other guards, level 67 or so, un-lullable and unslowable but NOT un-mezzable.  we were trying to figure out how to pull the slowable guy without getting his little buddy when it dawned on me.

I entered the house, mezzed the short guy gaining the agro of the big one... ran outside, out of range of the little guy and did FM.  He stayed behind and my group tagged the one chasing me.  Expensive way to split pull, mana wise but it'll work in a pinch when other tactics might not.

Just thought I'd share.</description></item><item><title>Newbified</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/635741/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2004 00:23:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:635741</guid><dc:creator>TheCanCan</dc:creator><slash:comments>7</slash:comments><description>im 23 hint hint (newbififed) apparently cant type either.

As I remember SOE gave some Bards with AA in this a refund. I think Tolain had a post about it in one of these threads but I can't find it. If anyone has any info I would greatly appreciate it. Bards in our guild are always having discussions about this. One bard in particular is telling another couple young bards to get Jamfest ASAP. I personally thought it was broken and remember SOE saying they weren't going to fix it anytime soon.</description></item><item><title>War Drums of the Rathe</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/635738/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2004 13:47:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:635738</guid><dc:creator>Jobeker</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>Well I got my War Drums of the Rathe which I am loving, but my Mod for percussion has hit the cap before I can take full advantage of them.

Or even just use instruments during a battle?

It's frustrating getting a bonus to songs when you use instruments but not getting to use them during a battle.

Currently, I'm level 11 and the only time I use instruments is: A drum when I'm traveling and a mandolin when I'm sitting and Healing.

That brings up another question : )
Where can I go to find out which instruments are better, I went with the mandolin for string because it cost a little bit more then the more popular cheap string instrument.

Any help on like playing styles or anything would be great, Bards are very fun, I can't believe this is my first one, I've made like every class twice except Cleric and Bard : ), both of those were at 0

1.Which Server?, This is narrowed down to, Rallos Zek, which I have lots of experience on but only encountered a single Bard, I was a roleplaying Ogre Beastlord and attacked at the sight of him and he got away once my blind wore off and the next got resisted and the next was Target is out of Range, he was gone : ) I'm wondering what the existence of a Bard on Rallos Zek is like, is it just running away from PvP whenever a battle ensues?, I don't want to live in fear, I want to be able to duke it out.

The other server is just simply a blue server, I can't decide between Firiona Vie, Stromm, or just my normal Karana, but this doesn't need to be discussed, if I don't play on Rallos I'll pikk one of these on my own.

So anything that you think could help sway my sever choice is much welcome, thank you : )



2.The other thing I am torn between is my race. The two choices I have it down to are Half Elf and Vah shir.

Since I don't believe in twinking, the Half Elf newbie Armor is really looking nice to me and I don't think Vah Shir have newbie armor

Vah Shir sounds really fun though because I have never made a Vah shir before and like their power and looks, while I don't too much care for Half Elf looks much. This will probly make everybody say then Vah shir is the one for you but I'm fine with playing a Half elf if it's obviously better. 

I think I could get away with going Vah Shir on a blue server since stats don't matter as much, but it seems like I would have to go with the Half Elf on Rallos. What do you think?

Yikes, Thanks to anybody that even took the time to read that, let alone respond to it hehe, I wanna make him as soon as possible, Wednesday at the latest.

Thank You : )</description></item><item><title>Bard Epic</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/635716/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2004 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:635716</guid><dc:creator>Jobeker</dc:creator><slash:comments>6</slash:comments><description>I just got mine done.
