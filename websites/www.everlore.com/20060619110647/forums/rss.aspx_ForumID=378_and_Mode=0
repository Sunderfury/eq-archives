However there is still a part of me that misses everlore and in particular that fateful night i stole briar's plat.  To all the newbies out there please go ahead be conniving, decietful, and rude, its makes the game much more fun.  For those who think it is a real society full of real people, try shutting down your computer...if you remember how to, and live somewhat of a life...maybe downgrade to PS2 or Xbox, and slowly ween yourself, because you are slowly becoming more isolated more indifferent and well more fat to the humanity that envelopes you...for those who cant do that, then i say have some fun, steal a little cheat a little lie a little.  Your obviously inhibited in your real lives, so why not act out in this virtual one... </description></item><item><title>RE: Jerks on this server</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1292023/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2003 19:40:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1292023</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>Go to goldenturkey.iwebland.com
This Gaddos guy thinks it's funny to train newbies and get them killed.  No reason behind it other than he thinks it's funny.  Next time you see him, get some payback for those poor noobz.

Havent played EQ in a while. I was once in a guild on this sever called Eternal Soverieng. If any of you are still around drop by and post.
 I played under the name of Sabiean, an Iksar monk.
 I also played under the name of Thraxsis, an Erudite wizard.
 Getting back in the swing of things and just waiting for EQ2 to come out. Give me a shout if you planning to play EQ2 and maybe we can hook up on the same sever and play together.</description></item><item><title>Guilds on TP</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1292017/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2003 19:53:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1292017</guid><dc:creator>Jorfa the Barbarian</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>I am in search of a guild to play with on Tholuxe Paells.  In the past, I have joined guilds without knowing much about them.  I would like to join a guild now that enjoys role-playing, but does not blow it out of proportion.  I also like to play with people who recognize that this game is supposed to be fun, not a powerfest (although I forget that myself sometimes).  Is anybody a member of a guild that the thoroughly enjoy?  Does anybody have any guilds they recommend?  Does anybody even read this board?  Thanks in advance.

I can remember when level 50 was the highest level. No epic weapons, except for the Paladin's. That was a long time ago. I left just before the release of Luclin. I don't have Luclin or PoP installed. It's a shame, really. My question is this, what is it about EQ that makes you guys still want to play? I played because at the time, it was one-of-a-kind. Sure there were other MMORPGs around when Everquest first made it's debut, but nothing imemrsed a player into a fictional world so well as EQ. But now, now there are plenty of options for the fantasy gamer. Don't take this post the wrong way. It's not a flame against EQ, and I don't regret any time I spent playing it. In fact, I credit EQ with providing me with coutless hours of enjoyment, an enjoyment that I could never find anywhere else. My name is Daekin Soulblaide. I am a level 51 Paladin on Rallos Zek. Answer me this, if most of us started playing EQ for the thrill of going on new adventures, why do we continue to play EQ when it is near impossible to adventure on ones own? Gaining experience or items of any worth require large groups. Shouldn't players have the option of grouping or not without getting left in the dust financialy or level wise? If this post seems like it's all over the place, that's because it's 3am and I'm a bit tired. I'm feeling the urge to come back (my character is still there, I checked recently), and I need to hear something positive from current players. I'm playing DAoC at the moment and have a level 43 Warden named Mythram Soulblaide on the Percival server. If anyone would like to offer their opinion on which game is better and why it would be much appreciated. No flames, just honest opinions.

P.S. Before I left EQ I gave the account to my kid brother who had never played before. He died and didn't tell me about it, resulting in the lose of all of my items, including a full suit of Valorium (probably not that good now) and whatever else I had. This is going to make my return to EQ even more difficult so let me know what I'm missing by playing another game, if I am indeed missing anything at all.</description></item><item><title>A new lvl 35 Nec on TP server ... </title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1292005/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2002 04:56:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1292005</guid><dc:creator>Heinrick</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>Yehaa .. made it .. was chalanged to make it to 35 before Xmas .. with 5 days /played .. i'm happy ..

I come to you under the gravest of circumstances...

Due to situation beyond our control, my friend, Tsark, and I were forced to abandon our bodies.  They decomposed before we had an opportunity to loot them.

Saddly, much of our livelyhood was lost when our bodies decomposed.

We are in dire need of weapons and equipment.  Items we need in particular are:

HtH (Magical) Polished STL Ulaks or equivalent (2x).  1hs (magical) Crystal Blade or equivalent if possible.  2hs (Magical) Darkreaver or equivalent if possible.  Shield (Magical) Shield of Kurn or equivalent.
WU's Armor (all slots).

We have 700pp between us to spend on these above items. I realize it when we are asking is far more expensive than what we can offer.  Thus, I am asking for
your generosity.

Please, email me at mike_red32@yahoo.com with any offers.

Thank you so much for your time!
