Of course not many would want to play it, but I guess I just miss the old days of playing EQ when the game was fun and a little more simple.  When getting a full set of banded was a huge goal for everyone.  Where traveling from Freeport to Qeynos was a huge journey few had taken.  When Blackburrow was full and everyone begged for sows and mino axes were all the rage.  I truly miss those times, but I guess you can never go back.  Maybe a classic version for gameboy? =P</description></item><item><title>Class Name Progression as Level Increases</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/2017899/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2005 02:08:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:2017899</guid><dc:creator>Transcen</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I've been looking and asking everywhere, but there is no list to show what a druid, wizard, shaman, etc. becomes after a certain level is reached.&amp;nbsp; For instance, I have a 52 cleric and it is titled "Vicar" now.&amp;nbsp; When I see other class names of higher level characters, I have no idea what their class is.....HELP!&amp;nbsp; (it doesn't help I lost my last list).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Please email me, or msg back thank you so much.&lt;/P&gt;

Same spell line basis as the necro, getting low lvl caster spells at higher lvls, but with the nukes(Just not as good) and Pets(Lower lvls also). I think it would be a pretty fun class.

what do you think about that? theguywhoisalwaysbored@yahoo.com</description></item><item><title>Idea for charmed pets</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1114859/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2003 06:22:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1114859</guid><dc:creator>Jez</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>Having been hunting with groups of druid and other classes who can charm lately, I've noticed how difficult it can be to determine which mob is a pet and which one we are killing.  Especially when you are fighting in a zone like ME, with 3 charmed wolves and a wolf you are killing.  Talk about confusion!  Even trying to use the F-keys and /assist to target can be a challenge. 

I would love to see a modification made that would make it easier to see when an animal has been charmed as a pet.  Maybe a different color on it's name?  Or a star or some kind of indication that it is a charmed pet.  Any other ideas or comments?  Has anyone else had this same problem?

Just my 2cp, would certainly make things a bit less confusing.</description></item><item><title>account</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1114858/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2003 03:42:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1114858</guid><dc:creator>Super soup</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>i reckon that we should be able to play chars on the same account , like u have a 50 + druid and u want to pl a new char you've amde you should be able to do that

"clever bind" or whatever.
it could be a self bind only that makes it to when you die instead of going to your bind point, your bind point would be what ever zone you were in but you would pop up by whatever zone you were closest to.
that way it wouldn't be that hard to find your corpse unless you were new to the zone. and if you are already Familiar to the zone you would aready know the way you would just get a huge distance taken from you.</description></item><item><title>what is LDoN</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1114852/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2003 17:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1114852</guid><dc:creator>Eqfan</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>i keep seeing this LDoN on all theese boards.

Such as guild/raid/quest info.

I used to love getting on the game and seeing the "You've got mail!" message.Friends can keep you up to date on things you missed while away,or important things you should know about as soon as you log on,if they're not on to tell you about them.

This feature would help people keep in contact better that would normally only see eachother every so often due to time zone differences.It would also greatly enhance guilds keeping all members currently up to date on guild happenings.</description></item></channel></rss>
