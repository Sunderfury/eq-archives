I notice a lot of guilds on Innoruuk, and my quieries are simple:

Which Guilds are particularly notorious and for which reasons? good and bad

Any particlar guilds considered the best? name the top 3

Having been in 2 guilds, neither of which reached my opinions of what a guild should be about, A little further research would be appreciated, before I considered joining another guild.

nb: I know how easy it is for people to post here the top guild happens to be the one they are in etc.. so I would trust some impartial postings.. if anyone actually reads this post lol =)

/Sam

ps: Any guilds consisting of mainly UK/Euro players? Or did everyone move over to the Euro servers?

Hello, I am Joelene, a level 22 Enchanter and I am here to tell you about Enchanted, the guild I want to start.

At first Enchanted was going to be just female characters of all races, but then I decided that male characters should be able to join too when several asked me about it, so now it is open to all people  The min. level is 15, however, and it is kinda started for the younger characters so we can all grow bigger and better together while moving up to bigger things.

It is pefectly acceptable if you are higher level and want to join, I wont mind at all, I just wanted to give you a taste of what you may expect in our goals and such.

If you are rude and don't enjoy being kind to people then please do not join, but if you do want to start this guild with me then please reply and post your desired character's name! Thanks a lot! ;)

Love and Light,
Joelene L`Mechante

P.S. There WILL be a website (many asked about that) when the guild is created, if you have any questions about that. I will be doing it myself since I am a professional webdesigner and if you would like to help out in any way tell me that too. I am open to many suggestions and such   :)

Maybe you've met me... but here's my problem:

Ok, so I brought all my alt's to EC to get rid of their valuables and give em to my main to sell, cuz my main had like 18 pp to her name. I got my bank items and all my stuff I could sell, and put it in my most precious bag (only a 400pp 70% one) and so I put the bag in trade slot, and a bug hit, and the bag disapeared. I tried petitioning but nothing happened, and I waited it out, but nothing happened.
I don't really want to risk doing stein quest cuz of screwing something up, and dyingm or having to bind myself for some reason, because im bound in OT. I dont want to go hunt because I always hunt in OT and im looking for fast money not fast levels. I know lots of you may say you can solo in certain places, but I suck at soloing 8(. 
Should I start selling my clothes for money or what? I need help!
Thanks,

By "Back in time" I mean I'll either go thru a zone change or log on and pop up at a zone change with the same equipment and platinum I had 2 to 4 hours earlyer. It doesn't always happen but enough that I've lost about 1K in Platinum and equipment and about 1 level of Exp. with each Charactor. Not only can't I play like this but I'm actully going in reverse! This started back in March and 45 e-mails later EQ still won't tell Me anything and won't replace the stuff iether. I stayed off for about 2 monthes and came back on a couple days ago and it happened again this morning. I am REALLY frusterated about this. If ANYONE knows anything about this I would actully pay to know!

Anyways I have met some extremely generous individuals and I feel priviliged.  I never asked for too much, 2pp for a stack of bone chips, but sometimes I get much more.  Most of the people surrounding me are smart assed twinks who just leave partially looted corpses just lying around everywhere.  I was able to buy my lev 8 spelly only because of Sancho's generousity, not to mention Gemi's gift of leggings and a robe.  I enjoy playing, but the higher levels just seem so much more fun, can't wait to join all you eventually.
