If I offer money will that change my faction back or should I just keep killing Grennet Stormhand.

Halflings level fastest, and right behind them is Vah Shir.

I would be grateful if someone post here,what´s the way to make  a Ratman Guard get popped.I´ve been camping Jail area at Hole for 3hours and got no Ratman Guards.

On the other hand,I am thinking about Mimics could be involved in a possible Triggered pop of the Ratman Guard.They are creatures related to the Epic Quest and drop a key needed to release a NPC in one of the cells.

Thanks

Set aside from the gods, elves, and monsters running around, all we do is argue just like in RL. I think it is pathetic how much you guys are arguing over this game, much like stupid disputes that we have over president and such. One would think that we would work together to find the best armor for eachother, the best weapons for one another, and try to find a way to make our characters, awwesome and fun, not better than everyone else. I first thought of this stuff becuz i went to find out about my epic weapon and there was NO information on it, just a bunch of ppl (not just teenagers, but adults aswell) agruing over whether the damn thing was worth it. That should be everyones decision for themselves. If people actually talked about it rather than argued and made really dumb comments about it, then we would fine out if it was actually good or not. If it is, then we would have something to try and get, if it isnt, then we should work together to find the next best thing for our characters. I am only a lvl 30 sk, and i ahvent been playing nearly as long as a lot of ppl, but i will tell you that after looking at some of the stuff that ppl are writing, I believe i can honestly conclude that all everyone is doing is making the game worse for everyone else and discouraging new ppl from playing by the way you talk about "n00bs". It is really pathetic. I honestly believe that the human race will kill itself, simply becuz we cant even talk about a damn weapon (that doesnt even exist mind you) without flipping a wig about it. I really dont mean to hate on everyone, as i am doing, but it is the simple truth. I hope my somewhat harsh words will jog something inside everyones mind to help one another, sk or not, and remember that it is just a game. I also doubt that many will read this, but those who do take the time, plz remember what i have said and try to make a difference in the game by being that much nicer and trying to help ppl find out what they are seeking rather than arguing whether or not they want to seek it. Take care and i hope you all to continue to enjoy the game as much as i do along with my family and friends. Take care all!

I`ve been killing the skeletons in najena for over a week now and NO hilts have dropped.. what gives?

And second: ashenbone drake... I`ve heard that this guy RARELY drops his hide.. I`ve heard stories of people killing him hundreds of times and not even dropping one hide... what`s the lowdown on this guy and why is it so damn rare?

All info would be great, thanks in advance
