I didnt mind being that i am only 47 so i went to help a new player by giving him some stuff that was just taking up bank spaces. I then get a tell from the rogue saying i can have Founy back again because he just got parchment and i can have him back then.  so instead of waiting i decided to look around and consider some stuff and saw the exterminator was blue so i tryed to pp him. Got the parchment top on first try. hope this helps anyone that is doing this quest.

-You don't have to be faster than the bear, you just have ot be faster than the other person running from the bear.(Curtosey of my friend's friend.)

-You should walk a mile in someone's shoes before you criticize them, that way, you'll be a mile away from them, and you'll have their shoes.(Curtosey of my friend's friend.)

-Don't bother to run from a grizzly, it'll chase you, knock you down, and eat you.  of course, you could always climb a tree, that way, you'll get a nice view of it's mouth before it knocks down the tree and eats you.

Stop complaining about the friggin looks of our epic. Personally I think our epic looks badass. The design of the dagger looks sooooooo cool. And I think that this item fits perfectly with a rogue. AND the ragebringer kicks ass. I cant wait to get my hands on it. (I wish i never quit my 35 rogue.) And most of you people who cry and whine about the looks of the ragebringer, probably dont have it and are probably not even past 20. Come on if you hate the epic looks so much then just go to a another class, like a BL or magi, if ya want the cool flickering lights. But if ya dont like it, leave it.
