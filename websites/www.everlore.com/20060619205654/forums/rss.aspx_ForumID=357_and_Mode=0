1-What is a better place for a lvl 32 Druid to group 
  OT(Over There)(Next to FM(frontier mnts and SF(Sky
  Fire)
                     [OR]
2-HK(High Keep)(I have never been here but my friend
  Stailes(30warrior) says he gets 2 blue bubbles of
  exp. 

 Although other people say that in OT on the 
 SF Ledge is better, I went from 29to 32 in 3days of
 only playing about 4-7 hours each day...

 Please Respond--I am on most of the day anyday just
 send a tell to Tresar =)

 I might even PL a lower lvl toon of yours =D ;)</description></item><item><title>Aussie Guilds</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1241532/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2003 08:55:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1241532</guid><dc:creator>Minlaven</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>Hi I am just asking about any Aussie guild on this server i am currently in SBTM and the raid time suck i have to get up at 4am on a monday mornig and normally dont get to finish riad becuase i must goto school so i am after an aussie guild so i can goto raid that i can stay till the end :) TY</description></item><item><title>WTS Paw of Opalla</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1241530/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2002 20:53:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1241530</guid><dc:creator>Padawen</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>Just wondering how much is a Paw of Opalla worth? because every time I ask someone all they want to do is freak out and try to buy it from me. I just finished the quest for it and found all the rings for it. I have a lvl 61 cavaleir. It took me like a year to finish the whole thing but it is finished I just wont to know how much it is worth and if its worth alot I will sell it so I can buy a horse.

Would high lvl players (like 50 on up) want to creat a dark army of Antonica. I think it would be awsome! My thinking is that we would take over the world on this server. Think of all the items we could get. With an army of lvl 50-60's we could destroy guilds and waste the FP millita. There is unlimited posobilitys. If you ever have read the Lord of the Rings it would kind of be like that, but not that savere. It would almost pretty much be a guild but we could go and kill any npc we wanted. If you are interested send a tell to Paylen. </description></item><item><title>newbie question</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1241517/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2002 15:59:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1241517</guid><dc:creator>atrag</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>Hi, i'm new on everquest(lvl.8 enchanter).

I am a level 15 Dwarf Cleric who is searching for a new place to call home. I know that I am still pretty young, but I have been leveling quite fast and I have played characters well past this level so I do know what I am doing. I am interested in concentrating on this one and making her my main.

I am looking for a friendly guild that I will be able to call home for a while. I am looking for a guild that does raid. I am not looking for a guild that has mandatory nightly raids. One or two mandatory a week will be fine. 

Please contact me while I am on Donamaria or email me at Shapeshifterdzs@aol.com

Thank you.
