OK, listen here, I love Drinal even with the newbs; I've heard some CRAAAAAZY crap about other servers that makes Drinal look likes it's full of the Uberest people in the game. Do you really think it's all that bad ?? I can understand the training.

 Ks'ing, If your alt is getting KS'd by a newb then please go back to your main so you might get a little knowledge of the propper way to twink an alt...

Also most of you people are actually considered newbish on Drinal even at level 51 with a bunch of alts.  When these posts were made most of you probably were still doing Naggy, hell i know i was; that or just starting Planar. 

Begging?? Hmmm I think I might have asked for an item or 2 and I've been asked plenty of times yet I explain things in a way a newb can understand it and yet feel welcome on our fine server.. Try this one "Sorry man/mam but currently I'm rather broke but I can offer you advice from someone who's been there [Place nice pointer here]. Maybe after you get to [place lvl here] we can get together and I'll learn you a thing or 2. C ya around"  Right there you have a reasonable,Kind decline, still offered help and put a sure end to the conversation with " see ya around". And if they still bug you then  /ignore or what have you; no need to be rude or bash um. Hell we're ALL still newbs anyhow, not a one of us knows everything unless you were a guide or GM, you'd feel mighty dumb at lvl 55 or so asking a lvl 60 how to do something and he says "get a life newb".  

Anyhow, everyone on Drinal and probably everywhere else is talking about all this uber crap they wanna do but all the good people  or people in general are in the good guilds allready and that guild doesn't wanna play with you.... Well you might have more friends in the future if you just adaopt-a-newb and show them a thing or 2.. Even better with that you KNOW how good the person is cause you kinda taught um ....

I am becoming increasingly depressed with my cleric, as i dont get as much action as melee types do(of course). I have started a monk and i am willing to sell every bit of armor/equip on my cleric for monk trades or PP. He has Donal's Boots of Mourning, Adamantite Epaulets,and a  Large Smoothmetal Torque(just to name a few) I am a Dorf Cleric of Brell Serilis and i have approx. 222 WIS..un KEI'ed. If you are interested send me a tell, my name is Zimob. Currently i have been playing other alts so you can also reach me at Kype, Missednote, Pileo, Idapimp, and/or Zimab.

His first name is Daeodil but i haven't been able to think of a good surname to give him.  If i use the name that you give me i will gladly give you a stack of arrows that I'll make for you at a reduced price.  If these events take place you will  have to come to surefall glade to pick up your goods.

My necro is doing pretty crappy, so I have decided to strip down my characters on the above mentioned server in exchange  for certain things here. If you are looking for a new beginning, but do not want to start Dirt poor, I can help!

On vazael I have some characters with mid-low level gear, for various classes, but I have a shaman there
That is pretty well decked out! A couple hundred pp and a spear worth at LEAST 1k!

On antonius I have a decently equiped monk and a pretty good necro on their, with some +int jewelry and a sac dagger.

On the seventh hammer I have a VERY well equiped gnome paladin, (nethebrian chitin, coterie sword, frozen LS, to name a LITTLE of my stuff on him) and a beastlord with decent equipment also.. just post here if interested.</description></item><item><title>So what are you doing on EQ tonight (wed)</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1292618/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2002 15:33:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1292618</guid><dc:creator>Zoner</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>Quaero (DrZin) and I plan on stomping around some Minotaurs and Muddites in the Gorge.
