I'm a 46 half-elf ranger that plays very often on the Xev server of EQ. I usually play from around 10 am central to 8 or 9 pm (with several breaks tossed in there, mabe 2 or 3, 1-2 hours breaks).
As the post says i am looking for a preferably large raiding guild, also preferable is one that raids during the afternoon hours, i work nights so i cant get on after around 10:30pm central time. Atm i am xp grinding so you can expect me to be even higher by the time you contact me in-game, i have nice gear for my level and some raiding experience. i dont play 7 days a week(i have a life outside of EQ :P) but im on 3-4 days a week for that long and another day or so at mabe 1/2 the time listed above. I am soon going to start my Epic so i am also going to need help with that. I'll shut up now, the posted name is my in-game name so i can either be contacted that way or via, this board, see you soon.

Although our goal is mainly a family-style guild, we will have many elements of a "balanced" style guild so we can do some raiding and help others with epic content. The Order of the Silver Hand, EverQuest is a nice place to be without the added stress of large, raiding guilds. 


The Order of the Silver Hand has grown to transcend several MMORPG games. Currently we run guilds in EverQuest, Dark Age of Camelot, Asheron's Call 2, Shadowbane, Star Wars Galaxies, Horizons, Final Fantasy XI, and World of Warcraft. (We are no longer run active guilds in Asheron's Call 1 or Anarchy Online though many of our players still play these games.) We are also looking forward to starting new guilds as new MMORPG games are marketed. 

In each game, The Order of the Silver Hand is a social guild offering friendship, information, and the benefit of our knowledge to all. Members enjoy the added benefits of companionship and being able to participate in guild hunts, quests, and other events. We foster a family-like brotherhood where you can rely on the other members to help, share knowledge, and encourage you along the way. 

The Order of the Silver Hand, EverQuest started in December of 2003 and we continue to grow... 

Please visit us at: http://tosh-eq.guildportal.com for more information. You can also email me: tosh-eq@cox.net. 

We're looking forward to seeing you! 

Regards, 
Jimious 
Guild Leader, The Order of the Silver Hand, EverQuest

The basis for this is the fact that most of the higher end game areas are next to impossible for a small, "non-Uber" guild to attain. So we seek to join (not merge) with other small guilds to attempt to make these areas attainable. Also to help with Epic quests, gaining other hard to get (or expensive) items. So if your tired of begging the "Uber" guilds for help or tagging along on someone elses raid and accepting the scraps not wanted by their members, send an e-mail to me at belbeast@msn.com . Thank you.
