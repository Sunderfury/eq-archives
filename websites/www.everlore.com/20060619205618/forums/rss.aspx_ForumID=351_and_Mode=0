Abiworld isnt up anymore and I greatly miss it.  I used to play, but I have many friends that play and I constantly play their characters, so I do know about active topics in the Everquest world.  The link is http://pub13.ezboard.com/btarewmarrboards   come check it out!  Tell your friends!  Let's get this thing rolling, the boards help so much as I have seen from playing on other servers that have them!</description></item><item><title>Guild</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1214576/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2002 01:02:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1214576</guid><dc:creator>whytfangoftarewmarr</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>I was wanting to join a fun guild.

Also, remember how old this server is... all the old players got their friends to play... who obviously pickeed the same server... and these friends got some other friends to play... etc. etc.

But I do agree that Verant should allow "Server Relocation (although maybe put a limit on it, so that people do not move 3-4 times a week... this would probably crash the servers, and destroy the "Server Communities")

I do not agree that the new $12.95 a month is being "greedy".  Economics 101 teaches about Inflation (read an economy book if you dont know about this... not saying you guys dont, but just in case).  I think that Verant has been very good about not over-pricing Everquest.

Ive been in 2 guilds since lv 1. Both being "social" guilds.  While the one im in now does do a friday night Kael raid (if we get enough people).
I have been asking the people Ive grouped with about thier guilds and what are the requirements to join, and what not.  Most have something like 3 references just to be looked at. Others have a lv min of 55 :(

What im looking for is to join a guild i see on &lt;a href="www.everquestraids.com"&gt;Everquest Raids&lt;/a&gt; that will have a event like 3-5 nights a week. i.e: Blood and Loyalty, of the Seekers, Pak'Cafan, The Sense, The Syndicate (wich ive been trying to get into since lv 25,wich was thier previous lv min. And Ive applyed 5 times with no reply ) 

Ive been to the Plane of Hate 1 time (while i was luckly enough to get my EM BP and EM Vambs) still. Ive only been to a plane 1 time!!!

Please tell me how to get into those guilds I mentioned above.
Am I not high enough lv for them?
Am I doing something wrong?  I like to think that I play my class well. The 1 planer raid I went on, I was commended on what a good job I did. :) I group well, always loot "need before greed" and am a prety funny guy to talk to ( at least i think)

Please, any information on how to get into the higher raiding guilds would be MUCHO appreciated.
