I was wondering where I should be hunting at level 30?  I am currently traveling to HHK and the RR/WR.  Is there somewhere better? Where should I head to next?

I am also looking for GM events to better my mana, I am tired of typing OOM!  Could someone help me in showing me where to find GM events or what Items I should get for the best mana gain?  

...Just trying to be the best healer I can...

Thanks,

Looking for the following chars (same person) - Vonyor, Illo.  I first started playing in Jan of 2001 as Grizelle (we druid) and then I had to stop playing (because of RL situations) in Aug. of 2001.  Then I came back in Feb 2002 and now I've been looking for this char and haven't seen or heard of him since I got back.  I've asked mutual acquaintances and they haven't seen him either.  Had his email address, but lost it or it never worked, cant remember.  Do know his real name is Daniel, so if anyone knows anything or if he reads this board, plz post. 

PS.  My new main char is now Elderdaina, so send me a tell in game too. 

PPS.  On Druzzil Ro server.

Thanks.

and i asked a lvl 40ish druid [By the name of "_____ quickleggs"(can't remember his first name)] if he would mind giving me a sow.
instead of me having to track him down he volontiered to come all the way down near cabilis to give me a sow

he asked me if i had any other chars and i told him i had a lvl 34 druid (at the time now lvl 39)and a lvl 11 cleric i just started.

he gave me almost all his gear and said that he was quitting Eq for some unknown reason.

he gave 2 pair of forest loop earrings and A centi warhammer.(which i later gave to my druid and gave 1 pair of the forest loops to my cleric

he asked if i could get on my druid and port his shamman to DL (which i did) he payed me 400pp for the port. then he ran his shammen all the way to Loio without telling me why.
i decided i was ganna make some more pp porting when he sent me a tell to get on my monk so he give me something (again which i did).

i got off logged back on my monk and he was already standing within eye sight.

he gave me 6 stacks of Sow potions for my monk.

now i don't know anyone else that generous on Eq.

No, I do not speak of the gods that we are required to worship upon inception, I speak of a deeper truth. I was once a scholarly lad, son of a noble family and forever bound to my books. Then I left my home and turned to the dark for strength and power. In that time however I researched a certain ancient text copied directly from a stone pillar that was old before the dwarves began to dig out their mountain homes. On it it detailed a ritual in which a dark deity could be summoned from beyond time. I seek to revive this ancient a true god, but alas I cannot do it alone. Join with me my fellows I implore you. If not for evil solidarity then for the riches that will await you once our dark messiah has come. We will meet in the Butcher's Block Mountains on Friday during the day. I hope to see at least ten of you there, then we will take it as faras it will go. That is all.
