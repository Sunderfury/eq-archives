I'm getting back into EQ after an almost 2 year hiatus (due to having an old computer and tight funds to get a new one).

I haven't played since about the time Velious came out (which I didnt get because of computer specs).

Question I have is what race/class people recommend?  I am familiar with the basic classes, having played shamen, chanters, etc.  I was just wondering whether the new races, and SOE's nerfs, have changed the strengths/weaknesses of the various classes.

Thanks for any imput.  </description></item><item><title>BTW</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1180738/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2003 21:32:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1180738</guid><dc:creator>Laeany</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>I am on th Morrell Thule server</description></item><item><title>Could I get some help PLEASE???</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1180737/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2003 21:30:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1180737</guid><dc:creator>Laeany</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>Okay, I followed a friend to Najena to hunt and all that good stuff, well, we have had some RL issues and now I can't get ot of there!!!

&lt;h3&gt;A BLACK Dragon Lies Beneath!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
I took the &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html" target="new"&gt;Inner Dragon online quiz&lt;/a&gt; and found out I am a Black Dragon on the inside. If there ever was an aparition of Evil, my Inner Dragon is it. Blackies are a fairly common dragon and are considered one of two harmonious dragons. My antithesis is the White Dragon. Together, we embody the Yin and Yang concept of eastern religions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But I couldn't care less about that garbage. I like to chomp things, cause trouble, and seek unjustified revenge. My favorable attributes are the Moon, the stars, dreams, psychic guidance, seeking truth, and helpful dark magic. Everybody's still got to watch out for me though, because deep down I like to smite at random and have a nasty breath weapon combination of Fire and Acid. *evil grin* Fun, no?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
