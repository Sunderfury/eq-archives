About the only thing most 60+ level raids will require from a mage is CoH! Face it, as mages go we're not setup for high level raiding. Every supposed upgrade magicians have had from the expansions, is really stuff that's been added as an after though. These are ablilities that we should of had from the start. The spells that are bearly worth having are all 60th or higher, and tend to be far too specialized to be used often. (These spells need to have the level requirements lowered, IMO)

As far as the pets go, consider that any unfocused pet will be about 3 to 4 levels lower then the mage summoning it. (Hence it being the agro magnet from hell) Worst of all, we just don't have "a" pet, we have 4 different types. Each with their own abilities depending on the element they are summoned from, which sounds great in theory, but hasn't worked out very well in practice. Lets take the Fire pet for instance... It's modeled after the wizard, and can cast and buff as one. This would be very useful if it weren't for two things. The pet goes OOM after buffing / first 2 nukes, and jumps into melee agroing and dying rather quickly because it has nothing for hit points or AC. Makes me wonder what Verant / Sony was smoking to think this pet model would be a great idea?

Adding insult to injury, our epic just about blows! First off we have the hardest Epic in the game bar none. Second, most guilds will not assist a magician with their epic's, as it offers nothing to improve the overall strength of the guild. Sure the pet is great, as long as your fighting mobs &amp;lt; 60th level, and you don't have any of the post 60th level pets. Beyond that it's ends up being the "Back-up pet", as most mages I know won't use them without a focus item.

Lets not even start me on pet weapons...!

The really sad thing is, I have to 2'Box my 65th mage with a 56th cleric, to keep up with a beastlord of the same level! (Not considering AA's and gear)

Overall, I believe mages need a major overhaul to be a worthwhile class with in EQ. Other wise, it's just a class to play as an Alt, not as a Main.

Help us that don't yet know.  Can you summon the epic and the other pet at the same time.  Or have them at the same time???  How tough is it really? Compared to say a 60 water. From someone who has it was it worth your time?  Just your opinion.  It is something I am realy looking forward to doing and getting.  So if someone could give me some accurate info that would be awesome.  If you don't know or feel like telling a lie plz save it so some of us who really don't know can learn some usefull information.</description></item><item><title>?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1296622/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2004 21:45:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1296622</guid><dc:creator>Super killer</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>I'm still kinda new to eq how do I find out what I need to do to get my epic?</description></item><item><title>What I Hate About Quillmane</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1296621/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2003 01:07:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1296621</guid><dc:creator>Thats MAGE, not enchanter!</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>1. Bertoxxulous server remains one of the last ones where South Karana is always populated with 20+ lowbies that still kill gnolls, aviaks, etc.
2. There are ALWAYS 2-5 50+ mages in there looking for Quillmane like I am.
3. All of them except for me has a ranger friend or a tracking alt.
4. The winged horse is totally unpredictable- no special spawn patterns, no time of day/month/year of spawns, no one location.
5. All of us mages packed into South Karana will fight to the death over who got in the kill, because if Quillmane ever popped it'd be a 5-way argument over who actually KS'ed and who was there first.
6. The amount of non-mages I know as friends who luckily killed Quillmane just passing through the zone with no effort at all. They offer to MQ the cloak for free, but I still wish I could get a cloak myself just for the pride.
7. The level 35 Shamans I befriend who only wish to get revenge on it for a past death *because Quill IS actually a slight undercon, but by the time we kill it, it doesn't make a difference* who tell me they've killed it, but the cloak didn't drop. The link leggings, I tell them to keep it, and they gate with some 7 sta leggings in tow as revenge proof where I wasted my l33t typing skillz on them. 
8. The Leggings I wear because I can't afford better always make me sick when I look at them, because my heart was so full of adrenaline when I first killed it that I ran for 1/2 a mile afterwards and was still pumped to go.
9. The 3 newbies that groaned about me killing the pegasus who said their mage was parked in here to loot it... even though a. leggings dropped and b. I killed it witohut any assistance from anyone else.

Well thats my complaint for the day...

Your group dies in a bad area,tottally wiped out. the mage,meaning me,casts invis on herself. runs to the point of where your.....lets say 12 member group died,she summons the epic,then the pet if she hasnt already,but probably hasnt since pets die when you invis,so she summons the pet,then the cleric in the group,and has him rez your group members one by one,and has a stable protector there at least until all the members are up an running,course you dont have to even rez them here,the mage can just drag all the corpses really,or just to a safe spot near where they were camping,so how is it this epic is bad. i think its just you ppl are mad cuz you worked so hard for it,or heard it was so hard,and looked at the stats and were expecting the most uber epic of all epics,whatever. well im gonna get this epic some day hopefully,also since luclin and pop came out it makes this even better,the fact we can now tuck our pets away now is awesome,meaning just whip that sucker out at any time if need be. =P (go ahead,flame me,like it will somehow affect me on the internet,i dont care)</description></item><item><title>The mage epic SUCKS&amp;lt;  read this....</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1296582/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2003 19:50:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1296582</guid><dc:creator>Tiger89 lonewolff</dc:creator><slash:comments>8</slash:comments><description>Well , for all that have POP ( planes of power) dont need this epic( mages) i mean at lvl 62 you get a NICE pet, which is called Call of ro i think, This pet is as good as epic pet, and at 65 u get a UBER pet like a lvl 60 pet

If you choose the Lava Elemental becareful you will get bad factions. I went in there at lvl 50 and could not hold down the whole room myself. The CWGs assist the wandering CWG place holder and the Lava Elemental. I brought along a lvl 50 cleric to help and could barely hold the room. I killed the Lava Twice and he doesn't drop the Power of Fire everytime it's just he drops it more often than the blazings. When the cleric left I stood no chance against the room so I went back to the blazing elementals. After about 18 hours of mostly camping the Blazings the Power of Fire dropped Twice in a row on the same room spawn.  Sucked to watch one rot after all that time spent. Hope this clears up some confusion. Good luck all.
