Doubt any of you still check this site.. I know you haven't been playing this game for a couple years now but i was filtering through my friends list yesterday and came across your names. Did an internet search on google and found some site for DAoC, though i'm not even sure your still playing that game. I know that's the game you left EQ for but still would be nice to know if you guys are still out there somewhere. Good old Landagar, Silverster, and Artoss got me into EQ so maybe, just maybe you still are around somewhere. Whatever.. leave one if your still around.

Part I


"Did you learn anything from that crystal?" 

Valdayana D`Varr's attention shifted to the Feir`Dal ranger who had silently entered her library. The ranger reached over for the amythest half buried under the scrolls the enchanter was perusing. It had been well over a year since she had last seen the ranger in person. Or had it? Valdayana sensed the inherent power that the ranger had acquired in her planes-hopping activities of late. Her equipment had also changed to reflect the demands placed on her by those whom she currently threw in her lot. Some things, however, did not change. The ranger remained aloof, unapproachable by most. There was something else though about the ranger's bearing that seemed... unsettling. 

"What is that ugly mask you're wearing?" Valdayana inquired seemingly ignoring the ranger's question.

"You like it? I got it from Rallos Zek himself. It's magical. I feel more... daring when I wear it."

"You dare much to presume to enter my home with an item bearing that sort of enchantment." Valdayana sniffed. "Take it off."

"Why?" Millikin reached up to remove the visor.

"The enchantment on that mask is designed to intimidate your opponents and I find it distracting."

"Really?" A sly grin crossed the ranger's face. "How distracting?"

"What happened to you the last time you attempted to try my patience, ranger?" Valdayana's innocent expression underscored the enchanter's barely concealed threat.

"You're in a foul mood this evening." Millikin slipped the visor into her belt.

"I am beyond such trivial emotional reactions. And I do not have time for your childish antics." Valdayana replied.

"Time. A nonspatial continuum in which events occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future." Millikin remarked flippantly.

"Your impertinence is only overshadowed by your ignorance." Valdayana commented offhandedly.

"Just as your intellect is obfuscated by your arrogance." Millikin smirked at Valdayana, still keeping hold of the amythest while pacing around the library. "Why did you send for me if not to inform me of something?"

"You said you wanted to discuss something with me that was too important to do through the usual correspondance." Valdayana waved the ranger to sit in the chair on the other side of her desk. Millikin ignored the gesture but stopped pacing. 

"I did. And so I'll ask now. What is a quintessence of the elements?"

"From an alchemical or philosophical standpoint, ranger?"

"What's the difference?" Millikin turned away, her attention momentarily drawn to the stuffed jackalope she had once inquired about and since forgotten. Valdayana raised an inquiring eyebrow at the ranger's reaction, getting the distinct impression that she wasn't telling her everything.

"If Saldaria's using you to wheedle information from me for her alchemical dabblings you can tell her to ask me herself."

"As far as I know, Saldaria knows nothing of this." Millikin responded carefully.

"How is the shaman doing?" Valdayana asked as she casually moved forward, hoping to fish out details of any falling out, if indeed there was one.

"I wouldn't know. When she wants something, she'll find me." Millikin shrugged. "Just like everyone else does." 

"Do I detect the bitter realization that your friendship means very little to someone who's lifespan doesn't hold a candle to yours and who has interests that are divergant from your own?" Valdayana queried.

"Are you going to answer my question or not?" 

Valdayana smiled despite herself, once her comment would have thrown the Feir`Dal completely off tangent and provoked her to anger. "One is a substance in it's purest state, the other a combination of the four elements into a new and separate form." She leaned back once more.

"That sounds contradictory."

"Unless you have an understanding of the major concepts of alchemy or philosophy, it would." Suddenly the realization struck the enchanter. The final component she needed to achieve immortality. No longer was it an unknown variable.

"I was entrusted with something. But I wasn't told the reason or what to do. And I wonder if you know something and didn't tell me."

"I know a lot of things and have not told you. You need to be more specific than that." Valdayana responded.

"These runes on my arm are in the Divine Language." Millikin pushed up the sleeve of her tunic.

"They enable you to traverse the elemental planes." Valdayana nodded. "I told you that already."

"I can also read and understand it." Millikin added, sliding her sleeve down.

"Are you going to come to the point anytime soon, Ranger?" Valdayana crossed her arms and waited expectantly.

"I guess it depends on you." Millikin took a packet of notes out from her tunic pocket and dropped them on the desk in front of Valdayana. "What do you make of this?"

Anyways, I wanted to say hi to some of my old guildmates and see how you all were doing.  I can't remember my password for my old login and for some reason it won't let me register for a new one.  So to any of those (Tattle, Maulear, Gwen, Valshoon, Ebane, etc. man I don't even know who plays anymore ) that read this and feel like dropping me an email just to say hi would be great. I am seriously considering getting EQ2 and want to see if anyone else is also.  Take care and best of luck to the Lotus Cult.

Apparently, two NPCs showed up in PoK (Hefty Lefty and Sneaky Pete) and were offering their services for a price of 400pp.

Anyone use them for anything?

I do remember that our guild leader abandoned us and then disbanded the guild..  and then it reformed...  but I guess that could describe a good many guilds.

If there's anyone out there who recognizes any of the names below, reply here or drop me a tell in game.
