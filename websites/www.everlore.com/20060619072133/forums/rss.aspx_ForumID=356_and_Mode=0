&lt;br&gt;You are dark and mysterious
&lt;BR&gt;Even those that know you sometimes question how well they really know you.
&lt;BR&gt;You are misunderstood.
&lt;br&gt;Most people think you are odd, and few can see past that eerie presence of yours.
&lt;BR&gt;Deep inside, you are sensitive, smart, and have a gentle heart.
&lt;BR&gt;Got Angst?
