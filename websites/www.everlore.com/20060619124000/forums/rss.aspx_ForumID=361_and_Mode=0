But I'm starting to get the bug again- wonder whats EQ and specifically Xegony is like these days. 
I'll probably have to start all over, how's Zrgony treat newbies these days :)
What's this about Freeport being evacuated or a ghost town or something?
If I came back I'd probably start with just the trilogy- get my feet wet and see if EQ still holds interest.

How much has it changed I wonder? I have missed this game very much but unfortunately had to spend 4 months as a special guest in a hospital in critical condition. I will have to say that one of the things that got me through 36 surgeries and unending time in a hospital bed, was thinking about all of my friends on Xegony. It's funny, some of the folks who are very close to me I have never met face to face. Doesn't seem to matter a friendship made online can be just as special as a face to face friendship. Now that I am back I can't wait to log in. I played on the Xegony server and was kinda wondering what everyone's opinion is of the game now.

Anyway all 26 levels i have seen maby 1 or 2 gm events on that server.. wait correction HEARD about 1 or 2 gm events. one being something about skeletons in Qeynos hills. Anyway I look at the screenshots area a lot and i see all the great GM events on the other servers and wonder.. "why arent the gms doing shit on our server? are they paid less or something?" Well anyway has anyone else noticed this? or am i just missing all of the events somehow and no one seems to shout there is an event, not even anyone in my guild on guild chat. Could someone clear me up on this? I dont feel like paying money to move servers...

I am looking for a regular group to get together around 7-9 pm PST to explore different areas one night a week. Since real life precludes me from playing as much as I would like I am cutting down to this and the occassional raid. I am flexible on the night just don't want to have to do the usual LFG thing for an hour. Would love to know when I log that at least a few people will be getting together to play. I play a level 60 monk. Please e-mail me at steelejaxon@yahoo.com if you are interested in hooking up. I am not looking to join a guild just a weekly pick up raid in different area each week with enough regularity that I don't have to waste a ton of time. If your guild already does this and you would like the company of a 60 monk give me a shout I would love to hook up with ya.

-It reads-

My name is Vorlonn Xen, I am a warrior, or so I at least thought I was until a few hours ago, now I am not so sure. By joining with the Ogre, Slurgg, I have taken a questionable path that may possibly lead to the very pits of hell itself.
God, who is this powerful warrior? Where does he really come from?
He is a killer, a mercenary to the house of Darkmoon, but I cannot help feel that I am part of them in some way. It is what my conscience is telling me. Is this not God’s tool to let one know right from wrong? But how can this be when all Slurgg’s actions lead to death and suffering? This is not the way of life I have been taught to understand.
I always knew that I was different, my dark skin making me an outcast to all the tall, pale-skinned High Elves and I cannot help but to hate them.
Please, God! Help me to think no ill thoughts. But have I been wrong in the way I live my life? What do I really know about life? It’s like a wasp trying to understand a Human. What if, when you become so much a nuisance to God’s grander purpose, you simple get squashed under-foot?
God, you want me to do your will! Yet now, you no longer answer me. I do not want to think these thoughts, yet where does this ugly creature get his strength? What kind of place is he from? It is though he is from another world, or, at least, not the world I know and perceive as reality.
Could his strength be a gift? A gift of some unknown God? Or is it the work of evil?
What of the magic that I now find myself able to use? I never believed before that I could summon destructive elements. But now, since I joined with the Ogre, my faith is stronger than ever, I feel the true god is close to me, watching my ever fight, every move.
Slurgg is telling me we are close to our destination; we are in the forest of Nektulos and I feel strangely at home here. As we sit at our small campfire, I can see shadows moving, the outlines of four skeletons, staring dully at a monolith as if waiting for a signal to attack. Slurgg assures me that they will not, but I am fascinated, though some would see these beings and be fearful, I feel as though I am connected with these dead animations.
So strange, though I have yet to see a light-source, except the setting moon, I can see clearly, some great power is fuelling my vision to pierce the darkness of this gloomy forest. God, are you real? What is out there? I pray for understanding. At this point, prayer is the only thing I feel will keep my sanity...
