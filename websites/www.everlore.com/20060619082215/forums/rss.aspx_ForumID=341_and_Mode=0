  does anyone know if the Elven Kingdom guild on Mith Marr is still functioning?  i stopped playing EQ for about 3 yrs and am now getting back into it.  i was part of the Elven Kingdom and would like to hook back up with them.  my character was a lvl 27 wood elf ranger named Sadira Thalasa.

  also, how much have the trade skills beed updated since Kunark first came out?  i'm hoping there were significant updates for fletching.  i'll be back on EQ as soon as my cable is hooked up.</description></item><item><title>***Guild Recruiting***</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1179039/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2003 08:07:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1179039</guid><dc:creator>Wuldaan Evilhunter</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>The Guardiani Di Luce are Currently Recruiting!

He was a 50th level Paladin last time I saw him. That was close to 3 years ago. There was also an Illusionist, I think her name was Alleura, or something very close, that I use to hang with. Wanted to see if anyone on the server had any info on either. Would love to see what happen to either. Any help at all? I think those who knew or know Grouper are going to be OLD SCHOOL junkies from way back. You guys were in The Hole last time I saw ya, and that was when it was only first being discovered. Had to give it a shot.

Later, 

BTW, if you do remember either, give me a tell. I'm on Quellious.
