So, what are your hopes both in general and for shadow knights specifically for EQ II?  Here are some of the things I hope to see.  Note I never had the chance to see the effects of AA in game so some of these things may be irrelevant.

In General:

1. Stop sending the monster mages to the warrior gym.  It ticked me off everytime I would see both the mages and the warriors of a race hitting me four times in two seconds for 90 damage a pop.  The mages are already annoying with the spells they keep flinging, we don't need them to be kung fu experts too.

2. Either make bash better at interrupting spells or nerf the monsters' ability to interrupt our spells.  Almost without fail despite having max skill levels any hit from a monster would cause my spells to fizzle while after bashing a mage mob a hundred times in the middle of casting their spells I might interrupt them once if I was lucky.

3. Nerf the melee effectiveness of bards and rangers.  If paladins are supposed to be the defensive hybrid and shadow knights are supposed to be the offensive hybrid then we should be able to out damage these classes without having to blow our entire load of mana casting DOTs and still being outstripped by them in the damage department (rangers).

Shadow Knight Specific

1. Give us better debuffers.  Shadow Knights are meant to be able to cripple their enemy through the use of debuffers and a pet helper.  While the pet helper will almost always be crappy our debuff spells should at least have a noticable effect on the mob.  Repeatedly I would see a mob that wouldn't even break its stride due to my debuffs despite stacking every single one I had that was stackable on the damn thing.  I hope that they expand on the idea of a SK only debuff line and make it effective.  In terms of pets and DOTs I can understand why we have a fourth of the power of necros at our level but in terms of debuffs we should have it at somewhere between a half to three-fourths of a necros power at a given level.

2.  Make SKs a real offensive threat in the game.  I don't mind doing less damage than a Warrior melee-wise, but combined with our spells SKs should be able to due an aprreciable amount of damage by comparison.  I wouldn't mind taking a defense hit in order to do a larger chunk of the damage in combat.  SKs are not poor man's paladins make them the offensive terrors they're supposed to be.

3. More SK specific equipment and quests.  I think all classes should be getting this.  I got sick of the lame quests at the beginning of the game that came around to absolutely no quests for most of the middle of the game and having to wait for the big class specific quests until the end game.  I think it would be cool to have a quest that spanned your entire career as a SK.  Similarly I think more personalized weapons and maybe even a special SK only weapon subtype might be cool.

4. More options for hiding from the guards.  Maybe a disguise skill of some sort.  The absolutely omniscient guards really ticked me off.  The disguise skill wouldn't be perfect, and enchanters would be better at it with their spells but it would add depth to the game and also help with the quest npc x hates your race problem.</description></item><item><title>HT aas</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/830304/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2004 23:51:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:830304</guid><dc:creator>Zaknafin</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>I just finished the Unholy Touch line of aas for ht and it only does 3500 dmg with unholy aura and only 1600 without which is only 500more then before the unholy touch and i was useing improved ht hotkey was wondering if u needed to get spell casting fury in order to get it up to 6k uncrited?

This is my first character so I will need real directions and information. 

I just completed the ENTIRE SK armor quests + Shield + Sword.

1. I was wondering if there is any more "item" based quests that are roughly my level.

2. What whould be the next set of equipment to get and where to find said equipment.

3. I am currently in East Commons working on my faction so I can enter Freeport. {just so you know where I have been}. I really have not gone farther since the armor quest kind of kept me busy.

4. I have all the expansions up to Ykesha {so you know what I can and cant do}. 

Thanks for the help in advance and sorry for any typos.

The reason I became a Troll instead of a Darkelf is for the Tanking end of a SK. I thought that both Trolls and Ogres could not be bashed from the front but to my regret it is just Ogres wich is no biggy really. I am the best tank around until u get 5 or more lvls above. I keep agro well and cast as much as possible and dont oom very often. Trolls are probably not the best Shadowknights but to each his own. I like how Trolls look in armor and there melee actions as well. (non Luclin Graphics) I hate the luclin troll look. Well I hope that helped some.
