 I am a tank and when i form a group i make sure everyone is a least 5 lvls higher then me. I always make sure of one of the ppl i pick for the group is a higher lvl tank and i can just damage deal.When the group is this lvl they will fight harder (red con) monsters and get better drops for you.when you pick ppl for your group inspect them to see what they have so you know what you may have to roll on. Also try and pick ppl from uber guilds cause they wont want any loot usually. You then can insist on need before greed to upgrade your equiptment for free or sell in the bazaar later on on.
 Ding! iam 65  so now i will let the secret out so ppl
can stop shouting to pay for pwrlvling servieces.

Me being the least playing everquest addict in norrath there is so much in the game now that i don't know. im kinda at a loss as to were to begin.
   But 1st off What is up with the LDON stuff? By that i mean the sockets, the guys selling crap ect. i went on one mission so far and I'd have to say im really liking this alot more than the olde sit and camp routine. What is this stone i need and where do i get it? at my hometown? and will i need a group to get it? Without it i was able to do the quest but all the npc's keep telling me im an asshole. also what do i do with those points i get for passing a quest? should i horde em till i have a lot or spend em as i get em? and what happens if you fail a ldon quest?
   thanks for reading and (hopefully) responing and if you need a poorly equipped lvl 34 warrior for your group dont be afraid to send Sewfly a tell!</description></item><item><title>gratz to team ctv</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1291151/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2003 00:57:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1291151</guid><dc:creator>FROGMART</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description> TEAM CTV crushed their pathetic opponents at the FREE FOR ALL best of the best event.

We are looking outside of guild for new leaders so we might learn more and gain from others experiences. We have offered these positions within guild first but many players due to RL issues could not commit to become an officer in VR. Please visit our website at WWW.Valorreborn.org and read our charter. We are a very democratic guild with a sound charter.

If you are not interested in being a leader we are always looking for more good players to add to our family. Feel free to send tells to Wrathian in game. 


Here are the prerequisets for guild leadership:

-Council members will lead and organize one raid per month. This will not be an impromtu raid. It must be a formal guild raid posted on Everquestraids.com and the guild web site. Only properly promoted raids will count. 

-Council members will be expected to help recruit and find new talent to help build the guild.

-Council members will need to visit and post on the guild message boards (Guild Web Site: www.valorreborn.org)) on a regular basis. This means responding to other posts and creating new threads.

-Council members will make every effort to attend guild meetings and guild promotional events such as Buff Heal Stations, and socials. We do not leaders who are only interested in doing raids for themselves, they need to be willing to organize raids for others and varying levels.

-Council members need to be willing to give to the guild without regard for one's own self interest. Leaders need to understand that a large part of leadership is helping others.

We need to know that leadership cares about the guild and is willing to do what it takes to ensure it's survival.

There is a guild called Council of the Spoken, and spacificly a charicter named Gilwile that have no respect for other players what so ever. His idea of a free camp is one where the person who has it, has go after a running mob. He stole a camp from me not once, but twice last night. Just wanted to warn everyone, and to say that this guy and his friends from Council of the Spoken are now on my lookout list and will NOT work with any guild I am a member of if I have anything to say about it. Thank you for listening while I rant.
