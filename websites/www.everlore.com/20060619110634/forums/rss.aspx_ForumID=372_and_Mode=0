&lt;P&gt;A great time for PvP, and at the height, I established the Dark Army to organize PvP wizards into a cohesive strike force.&amp;nbsp;Of course this will be lost on most who never played back then, ridiculed by the few that did and were ganked by the Dark Army's kill squads, and a good read for those that we fought against or along side.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I dug this out of the archives for anyone who remembers the old EQ days on Rallos when PvP was fun.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Enjoy,&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;"Hail Dark Army, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We are in need of members who can agree to show up one day a week for guild hunt nights in a certain zone that we are controlling.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Currently the guild hunt nights are Monday, from &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;8pm&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;12am EST.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; Our strength comes from being a team. We have a blast attacking other guilds and players, but without unity any guild is destined to fail.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I guarantee you'll enjoy the experience!&amp;nbsp; I've included our charter so you can understand what the Dark Army stands for.&amp;nbsp; We must be unified in our ways if we are to succeed in our goals. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;DARK ARMY CHARTER:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our goal is to build the largest standing army of player killing wizards on the server.&amp;nbsp; But not an army of weak, second-rate PKers, we want experienced killers working with us.&amp;nbsp; The only way to get this experience is to get out and battle with other players and guilds.&amp;nbsp; Only by fighting other players will we grow in strength and learn the skills needed to destroy our enemies.&amp;nbsp; The following are the goals and obligations we must observe to obtain our destined greatness. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Level 12 WIZARDS ONLY guild:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The goal is to build a circle of 12 wizards that will be the center of the Dark Army.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;That’s one officer and two other wizards per attack squad.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;All Wizards need to reach level 12 and stop at that point.&amp;nbsp; When we are all the same level we can attack the same targets; this way our numbers count for more.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;We can take out buffed or twinked enemies that are four levels higher when we attack as one force. In addition, anyone that attacks any of our members can be attacked by all of us.&amp;nbsp; We are the wolf pack that takes down the lion.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;When we have twelve wizards working together we will own anyone we meet regardless of buffs, level or healers.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;That day is coming, but until then we must work as a team to maximize our power.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Battle&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Conduct:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;During guild events all members are required to show their guild tags.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;The ranking officer at the hunt will use their hotkeys to declare who the next target to kill is.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;All members need to create a hotkey to show that they are targeting the same victim.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;The standard hotkey is something like: ”Preparing to fire on %t” (Percent ‘T’ will say the name of the victim that has been targeted.)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fire upon the target until he is killed or an order to fall back has been given. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Conduct regarding killing:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;GET OUT AND DO IT!!!! &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Dark Army is dedicated to organizing teams of player killing wizards into attack squads.&amp;nbsp; These squads are tasked to attack all non-members.&amp;nbsp; We don't want you to talk the enemy to death; we want you to kill him! We don't care how you do it or whether it is legal or not.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Anyone that crosses our path is subject to immediate attack.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Every guild member you know today will be a brother in the next game system. That is why we are powerful.&amp;nbsp; Our guild will grow in this game, and we will grow even stronger in the next game system, and the next, and the next.&amp;nbsp; As role-players, it is reasonable to believe that we will always be playing the latest and greatest game systems.&amp;nbsp; As we move to them we will have a guild of experienced player killers to battle new guilds and players.&amp;nbsp; Join us and grow with us; add your strength to ours and let our power be your strength. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Malakhan"&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

#3: some disadvantages to that server.
#4: if that server alows you to loot others.
#5: do Jewelers make good or better money on pvp?

well some of my experiences on Pvp is that Wizards are built to kill!  I can kill nearly everyone in my level range unless they are some uber tweak with ultra MR gear or some uber tweaked warrior with all HP gear.
My skills on my wizzy are completely maxed and i cant even cast a spell and land it on most UBER tweaks.  Thats were rogue comes in because even with uber gear i can still hit them! so those are my 2favorite PK classes and ive had over 10k on pvp by doing nothing but pking and them antipksthey are poor little boys best to stay pk!

I have been told that all spells 1st roll against your svM then against the actual resist. (Example: Immolate would 1st roll against youre MR then if not resisted it would role against your svF) is this true? or does every spell role only against the resist designed for that line? I have MR of over 200 and still get nuked and DOT'd constantly, is this do to having lower sub resists?

also.... is there a site anyone knows of that would have this info, and perhaps other PvP tips?</description></item><item><title>EQ GOD LOCATIONS</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1281910/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2002 16:33:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1281910</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>I know you can find the gods but where are they?

People always pk in the zone, and it is one of the zones where you take a faction hit for killing elves. so alot of people attacked by elves run all the way to CB or Lfay and then fight, after they have taken some damage already.
Make it so you dont take a faction hit in gfay.

Then you have Rallos where it is everyone for themselves and some people will kill you after they group with you and realize they are stronger than you...also fun.
Then tallon...alot of whiny babies with uber gear bragging that they deleveled from 51 to 35(everyone knows who that is lol) vs. people who want to play true pvp team and have no chance against a 4 team guild...so it is basically guildwar between the 4 team guilds. Haven't play on Vallon so i can't give my opinion...sorry.
Why not make a server with a mix and match of all the rules.  Not exactly hardcoded...but it has an exp bonus if you are only grouped with your own team. Bring back the rule where you can pk at lvl one cause that was cool(i got killed by alot of lvl 9 druids when i harmtouched them for 11) and the old con system they had way back then (where people could con blue and yellow like a mob would)....or something similar. And make newbie armour quests a little easier cause new servers are always flooded with people who get the rare items people need...then they quit the server when they realize they suck at PvP. And use the Race teams (preferably cause it sux to have to go con everone before inviting them to group on sullon) or the Diety teams(keep agnostic for chanters though....greatly helps out faction and increases the number of chanters on a server..just make agnostic on the nuet team) with the 8 lvl pk limit that is on Tallon and Vallon. 
It's sorta in the middle....if anyone has an i dea or a change they think would help the server add it(not that they will likely make this server any time soon if at all) but hey...it could happen(yeah right....and verant can bring back the moss covered twig)

I love pvp, but it's stupid that you can twink up for excample a rouge, give him roughly 300hp worth of gear and 150 to all resistanses and running around dual weilding Blood Points...and ofcourse JBoots. 

This kind of character ruins the game. He could take out full groups all alone. I belive twinking is ok. But wouldnt pvp server Ralloz Zek be more skill related if you put caps on 70 to resistanses, and high dmg/low delay weapons wouldn't be wearable until higher lvls? Id like some views on this, because i belive it would save what's left of lowlvl playing on ralloz zek....and fun hehe.</description></item></channel></rss>
