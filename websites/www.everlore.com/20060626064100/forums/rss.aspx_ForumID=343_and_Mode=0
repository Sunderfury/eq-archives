I was wondering if there are any guild on Povar with mainly european players in it.

I know there are european servers but i am on povar longer then those servers exist and lots of friends are here.

Kind of tired raiding in middle of night with one or two hours sleep and then work again (

I once ruled the EC tunnel on the Quellious Server, but now i plan to join you all within Povar. I look forward to returning to EQ, and i look forward to making new friends. Though im sure i'll be a bit lost at first(since i know EVERYTHING has changed), i should figure everything out within a couple weeks....hopefully. I dont plan on being a tunnel rat(i guess it would be a Bazaar rat now) anymore because thats all i did for the years i played EQ before. I want to get myself out and get higher level than 40, thats the highest i made it on Quellious. But i had the gear that most 55+ didnt have, well droppable gear anyways. Now i'll be starting out fresh, so i will be on the trading wheel for the first couple weeks or so, after all, ive never been to Luclin, and i hear its nice this time of year. Anyways, again i look forward to meeting as many of you as possible, and hopefully Povar will bring me the same excitement that Quellious once did. Be sure to keep an eye out for me, as i will be opening a new account within the next week or two.

I am wondering what it would regularly go for, I have looked in the bazaar everytime I have been there and no one has been selling it. So I come here to the boards to ask the people here for their wisdom. 


Many thanks :)

Awhile back, Everquest updated for Luclin, making bigger and better graphics to keep with the times.  Unfortunantly, my computer couldn't keep up any longer.  One day, I just couldn't get in to the game anymore.  I could not say goodbye to anyone, not give away my gear to the needy, nothing.

I am wondering if anyone rememembers Jequeg (35 Necro), Jequen (35 wiz), or Jequel (52 cleric)

Some guilds I remember being in: Shadows of Silence, Mercs of I'v, Dark Legion,Mouth of Madness, Dark Legion, and Forces Unknown (final guild before falling out)

Anyway, Thanks alot...any little tip or "yeah, you buffed me one time" would be fanastic.  I will be coming back in Troll Shaman form shortly ;)
