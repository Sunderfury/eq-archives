Basically, I have a lot of tank and wisdom gear for trade while my friend who is also joining me on Rathe has some pretty good Int-caster items to trade.  What we ask in return is:

Decent stuff for an Iksar Shadowknight, mid-range stuff would be fine as long as I have a good amount of it.

Likewise, good mid-range stuff for a Gnome Magician.

So here's more info for what we have for trade on Stromm:

3 pieces of High Elven cultural armor (Blessed Full Mithril).  Specifically the Breastplate, Greaves, and Vambraces.  They have strict requirements (Only useable by 3 races and classes, and diety must be Tunare), and a recommended level of 46, but it is very nice armor.  If you cannot use it, you can always sell all 3 pieces.  On Stromm you'd get about 30k-35k for all three.

I have an abundance of mid-level melee armor.  My Cleric has most pieces of Sandblasted armor and my warrior has quite a few pieces of Crustacean armor along with a Kunzar Ku'juch.  You'll have to forgive me because I don't know off the top of my head every single piece of equipment I have, but it is fairly decent mid-to-high level stuff, most of which is great for twinking.

My friend has some good Int caster gear, including a cloak that's worth 14k among other things.  I don't know the details on what he has exactly because it's not my toon :P

If you're interested, contact me on Rathe.  I haven't created my SK yet but his name will either be Armodeus, Valdruss, or Daedriss.  If all those names are taken then I'll simply come back and tell you what mine is.</description></item><item><title>Seeking Master Smith</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1218089/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2003 20:38:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1218089</guid><dc:creator>drowlover</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>I am needing a Master Smith to help fashion some of the new LDON ringmail armors for me.

The Norrath Travel Bureau would like to extend our family's hand in aid to the new tadpoles of Gukta. 

We hope to offer this aid in Innothule swamp and our plans are to be there around the clock throughout this first week of trials for the tads of Gukta. 

Of course the Plane of Reality may call us for aid from time to time, but our goal is to be there as much as we can during this towns primary week. 

We offer aid in the manner of "Buffs", and occasionally Mage summoned gear, Clarity/Breeze, as well as small items as able to donate, etc. 

Any that wish to stop and visit please do so, comraderie is always available. 

Zanatil Honorblade, 
Knight of Tunare, 
Council of the Norrath Travel Bureau

The guild is geared to fairness and equal say for all members. Your not find multi-tiered levels of power, committees, slanted loot rules or other non-sense. 

Our goal is to reach a membership large enough to be able to help any member obtain an item regardless of zone. 

All raids are voted on by members, not dictated by officers!

All classes, races and anyone over lvl 15 is welcome. If your under lvl 15 but are familiar with the game enough to have decided to stay with it we want you too!

Please, no young children. We are sick and perverted and this is not for young players.
