I am only at the very beginning (a lvl 57 Warr decently equipped) hunting the "Heart of Frost" in Perma Keep. I have a walk-through, but its from 2001. 

I have 2 questions right now:
1) Are there any decent UPDATED (like 2003/2004) Warr Epic walkthroughs or sites that any one knows of?
2) I've checked alakazam (sp?) and it says the Heart of Frost is a "common" drop off of Goblin Wizards in Perma Keep. I have been killing Gob Wizards there for 2 days now, making a continuous circle of the fort and killing all goblins to force spawns. Still no drop, and I'm sure I've killed well over 20 Wizards. Any ideas/knowledge about this drop? Has it had its name changed or does it drop elsewhere?

any help would be appreciated =) Thanks in advance!

Kargak Redblade is standing next to a Dwarf named Wenden Blackhammer in East Freeport. To get to them, head in the gate from North Ro and follow the left wall. They both start the quest. 

Hilt # 1 - Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt 

Head to Lake Rathe and pick up an Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt. It can be found on the lake floor underneath the aviak tower. You'll also need to get a Diamond, Black Sapphire, and Jacinth. They drop in various zones (Sebilis, Planes) and can almost always be found for sale in The Bazaar. 

Take the Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt, Diamond, Jacinth, and Black Saphire to Wenden to receive a Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt. 

Hilt #2 - Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt 

Head to the chessboard in Timorous Deep. At the base of the King piece you'll find a Severely Damaged Dragon Head Hilt. 

You'll also need a Ball of Everliving Golem. This drops from the named golems in the Plane of Fear: Fright, Dread and Terror. 

Now go to the Dreadlands, to the giant fort just west of Karnor's Castle. You need to kill the Mountin Giant Patriarch and loot a Giant Monocle. Take the Monocle to Frontier Mountians. Get to the giant fort and get inside. When you get to the very end of the Mine you will see the giant named Mentrax Mountainbone. Hand him the Monocle he will give you Rejesiam Ore. 

Now run back to East Freeport with the Rejesiam Ore, Ball of Everliving Golem and Damaged Dragon Head Hilt. Give these to Wenden and receive a Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt. 

Sword Blade # 1 - Ancient Sword Blade 

Talk to Denken Strongpick on Aviak Island in the Ocean of Tears. He'll tell you what he wants for this rusty old blade he found on the ocean floor: 

a) A Keg of Vox Tail ale - bought from alot of vendors around the world. A good place to buy one is the sandfishers in North Ro or the Freeport Port Authority. 

b) A Block Of Permafrost - Dropped by Ice Giants. (while you're here, kill some goblin wizards until you find a frozen goblin heart -- you'll need it later). 

c) Two Rebreathers - Tinkered by Gnomes. Expect to drop as much as 4k for getting two rebreathers. 

Turn the Rebreathers, Keg of Vox Tail Ale, and the Block of Permafrost in to Denken and you will get the Ancient Sword Blade. 

Sword Blade # 2 - Ancient Blade 

The Ancient Blade is dropped by the Queen of Chardok. Bring along a large group of friends. 

The Red Scabbard 

Talk to Kargak Redblade in East Freeport (he is standing next to Wenden) and say "I will do you a favor." You'll get a letter (wax sealed note). Take this letter to an Ogre in Feerrott named Oknoggin. He hangs out between the Stone Bridge and the Fallen Totem. Hand him the letter and receive a Tiny Lute. 

Run back to East Freeport and give the Tiny Lute to Kargek Redblade to receive a book. Take the book over to his brother in East Karana - Tenal Redblade, who is at the very end of the canyon next to the ramp to Highpass. Hand him the book and receive a Frozen War Totem. 

Go back to East Karana and hand Tenal the Frozen War Totem and a Heart of Frost. He'll give you a Totem of Fiery War. 

Now get yourself a Green and Red Dragonscale (from Severilous in Emerald Jungle, and Nagafen in Naggy's Lair respectively).

Go back to Tenal Redblade and give him the Totem of Fiery War, the Green Dragon Scale and the Red Dragon Scale to receive The Mark of the Sword. 

You'll now need to go to the Plane of Hate and kill the Hand of the Maestro (note: Hand is now pullable without having to kill Maestro of Rancor). You need to loot the hand, which is a rare drop. Bring that back and give it to Tenal along with the mark and he gives you a note to Kargek. 

You now need a Spiroc Wingblade from the Spiroc Lord in the Plane of Sky. Take the Wingblade and the note to Kargek where he gives you the Red Scabbard and instructions on how to combine the Ancient Blade, Ancient Sword Blade, Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt, and Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt. Do this and receive your reward.

I need the scales mainly, but all classes who need the epic pieces will be rolled by those classes only. All other items are rolled also, I will be the one looting then we will be rolling on all items, If I see anyone else loot his corpse, I will petition, because you will probably be ninja looting then leaving asap and sell it to make prophet. This will be on Bertoxxolous server, at 4pm pacific, 7 eastern.  I  need as many people to come as possible. Thanks</description></item></channel></rss>
