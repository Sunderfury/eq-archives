It's like someone realized "Hey, people are still getting on here! Let's screw it up a little more." and then they proceeded to hose the javascript that logs you in. 

Why was this done just to Everlore? The other RPG Lore sites are still running fine. I think we all know the answer to this. We were a little more cutting edge, a little wittier, our arguments were more intelligent, our posters more attractive. We are the Lore elite and we're being punished for it. Elore we hardly knew yee. Rest in peace, old friend.</description></item><item><title>where can i get a sweet computer?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1663118/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2005 21:52:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1663118</guid><dc:creator>jack of me off</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>ok im looking to spend between 1200 and 1800 on a new computer, anyone know where i can get the best deal on a desktop for that price range?</description></item><item><title>Returning from a long hiatus...</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1663114/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2005 19:20:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1663114</guid><dc:creator>Sand Rider</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description> ...and bringing a new identity for the ride. No apologies though and no hints about who or what I may have been in the past.

 As has been noted, the forum seems to be rather a bit less active than I recall, so allow me the honor of trying to stir something up. An innocuous thing really...

 Do any of you recall the old Disney film "The Black Hole?" I'm hunting for a copy of the screenplay and have had absolutely no success to this point. Anyone feeling inclined to be mildly useful or possibly even (dare we suggest?) &lt;i&gt;helpful&lt;/i&gt; should post an appropriate link or information.

 On another note, it seems to me that there is a general lack of the once rousing debate formerly found here in. Have the powers finally declared a suspension of certain topics or are we simply experiencing that famous calm? In either case...I must say I'm a touch disappointed. Where are the firebrands of the left and right? &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/sand_rider/"&gt;Particularly in light of the Roberts nomination...&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/sand_rider/&gt;Good government never depends upon laws, but upon th personal qualities of those who govern. The machinery of government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery. The most important element of government, therefore, is the method of choosing leaders.&lt;/a&gt;
