Now for the real questions:
With all these new expansions and me being a level 40 Cleric, where is the best place for me to level?  I know people say DL is good, but to tell you the truth, I don't really like DL.  Where are some good places to level with groups.  I have done LDoN from 35 and am looking for a little variety.  I wanna start doing planes groups at 46 and am looking for a good place to get it.

Also I still have tailored gear.  Good gear dont' get me wrong, but is it time for me to upgrade to plate armor?  I was thinking about spending my adv points on a good BP it had +5sta +5wis +10hp mana and end.  Even though my current chest is +8wis I think I can pick up the 3 wis in another slot.  anyone know whats a good, under 10k BP?

My cleric is just 3 blues shy of 51 and my friend has a ranger that will shortly be 50 and we find it difficult to find mobs that we can duo without me having to heal him to death.  He probably needs better armor, that goes without saying, just wondered if there's a zone that isn't too bad without needing a third person.

I don't have Sol, so those zones are out.  Is SolB the best option?  We've done DL and most mobs are DB or lighter now.  

Plus how do you start getting flags for the planes?

Ok, flame now.</description></item><item><title>Where to lvl from 40-46</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/654156/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2004 23:02:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:654156</guid><dc:creator>Drothor</dc:creator><slash:comments>8</slash:comments><description>I was wondering if it would be better to level from 40-46 doing LDon...Because I find that with a good dps group...I can get about 2 yellows an adventure...Then at 46 should I start planes groups or should I continue on with LDoN???</description></item></channel></rss>
