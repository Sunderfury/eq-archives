They are very hard to solo becuase they are a more group orientated class, having powerful buffs and debuffs make grouping with an Enchanter an experience to remember.</description><dc:language>en-US</dc:language><generator>CommunityServer 1.1 (Build: 1.1.0.50615)</generator><item><title>1.5 epic bypass</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/2018143/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2006 23:54:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:2018143</guid><dc:creator>zhezha</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><description>Does anyone have any links to help me find info on enc epic 1.5 with bypassing 1.0?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you very much :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zhezha&lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><title>Level 18 Enchanter looking for best places to hunt</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/687676/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2005 14:19:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:687676</guid><dc:creator>Filder</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>Anyone out there who can help me out by telling where I can go to hunt solo?

I have been considering trying an enchanter character after comparing classes.  I noticed that the enchanter class is actually the class I find the most interesting.  The problem is that I only decided this long after trying out other classes (one of them to level 54) so now I must start from level 1.  I do not have the option to twink any characters anymore so I will have to start from scratch entirely.  I cannot afford to spend extremely long periods of time on the game therefore I seek very quick leveling.

I need advice on how one would level an enchanter quickly to level 50 (if I can get there then the character is high enough I can continue without worrying about rushing as much).  Do to the nature of this strategy I would only be soloing (not a problem since I tend to do things that making soloing interesting).

My current theory is this: 
Post level 12 I would buy the charm spell, the psell memory blur, whatever other spells can be afforded (as most of these are less important in these strategy they come next), and keep a supply of SoW potions on hands whenever money permits.  Then if possible I would consider buying mana regen buffs (although this would be not necessary).  I would then proceed to go to a zone which has effective creatures that can be charmed and have them defeat lesser npcs very rapidly.  Perhaps for example Griffawns against Carrion beetles.  If charm breaks I can run and root then enemy due to the SoW potions.  Also, memory blur can perhaps substitute if I cannot afford SoW potions.  I have heard memory blur wipes out all argo from nps which causes them to quit attacking you.  

Does anyone have any type of advice?  Questions of particular interest include:
Where to hunt?
Which npcs to charm?
Which techniques work best?
How long do you estimate it would take to get around at least level 45 or so?  This is very important because I cannot really afford to spend extremely long periods of time on the game.  I am hoping level 45 or even 50 can be achieved in one month.... although my last character took much longer to get to that point.....

All help is appreciated.</description></item><item><title>The Silent Competition Among Enchanters</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/687656/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2004 16:08:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:687656</guid><dc:creator>Guest</dc:creator><slash:comments>6</slash:comments><description>Good Enchanters are extremely competitive, but you'd never know it from the way we act.  Why?

We're cool under fire.  If we weren't we'd wash out around level 30 or so.

We don't lose our temper (much).  If we did we'd wash out around level 49.

We're good communicators.  I was terse; others are chatty, but we all get our message across, or we wash out around level 30.

We tend to have fast reflexes and are often hyperactive in RL.  This isn't strictly necessary for survival, though.  Slow Enchanters get yelled at and complained about a lot, but don't seem to actually wash out.

The question, 2 years after giving away my account and never even thinking about the game again until today, the question that brought me here is, "Why are we so competitive?"

I was driven to be The Best, and I was shocked to discover I was not alone in that regard.  The other "good" Enchanters weren't born that way; they were pushing themselves just like me.  We all tried to hide it, another thing that baffles me, and we do a hell of a job hiding it, but we were all clandestinely measuring ourselves against each other, straining to be The One They Talk About when the topic of Enchanters is broached.

Why?  I'm not like that in RL -- "good enough" has always been, well, good enough.

It's not as though Enchanters can't tell if they're good enough.  If you're good, you know it.  Maybe modesty keeps you from admitting it, but you know if you're good.  This isn't the sort of job you can screw up and not know it.  What you DON'T know is how good the other Enchanters are.

Others in the group start idle chatter about so-and-so Enchanter, and it's all you can do to keep quiet, when you want to pump them for information:  who is faster, do they move around a lot or stand in place, are they good, and -- more to the point -- are they better than me?  (I was a move-arounder, FYI, and always wondered whether the stand-stillers who were called "good" had some kind of edge I didn't know about ...)

But I never asked any question more direct than, "How'd you guys make out?" (hoping they'd talk about the Enchanter).  If they knew I was "keeping score" they would think I was arrogant, and that would be bad for morale.  "Good" Enchanters don't worry about things like that.  They just ARE.  So I kept quiet.

Honestly we really are in a kind of "rapture" when we do our thing, a constant press of pounding awareness, an immersion that transcends the game genre's "escapist" model.  It's more like an altered state of consciousness.  (When this "natural high" wore off, as one expects of all such things, I stopped playing and found a new hobby.)

But even the intensity of the experience, the purity of focus channeling every concious thought into situational awareness, the almost terrifying pleasure that came day after day hitting the same dungeons over and over (there are only so many), didn't wash away that competitive urge, that starved hunger to be The Best, that worry that I didn't measure up, that someone else's name was being bandied about instead of mine.

When I hit 60 I started doing AE groups, which means making close friendships with other Enchanters, good ones, and that "who's better?" meme mutated into "who should I group with?"  It was only then I learned that I wasn't the only one who waged a secret war for supremacy.  It seems to be a common condition.

Why?

It's been 2 years, maybe more, since I have even thought about this game, but I thought about it tonight, and this is the question that percolated up and nagged at me until I decided to ask it here.

Why are Enchanters so competitive, and why do they keep that competitive streak hidden?</description></item><item><title>LDoN spell:'Deception' questions</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/687655/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 May 2004 00:11:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:687655</guid><dc:creator>Vash85</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>1. Is it true that Deception finally went live? I heard a rumor that it went live on Luclin, from Allakhazam's. 

2. How much does this spell cost, and is it true that you have to spend favor points instead of adventure points, now, to buy this spell?

3. Can it really illusion ANY pc/npc target? Even player characters with their armor and everything, and HG and Cazic Thule?

4. Does the spell still work if you zone? One of the test issues for the spells was that the npc models only exist in thier respective zones. So, it would be impossible to stay illusioned as a certain mob, if the server doesn't have the mob's model programmed in the zone.</description></item><item><title>Stuck in illusion</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/687652/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2004 04:35:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:687652</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>One day I was running around in Illusion: Skeleton, and I would run up to a newbie and /shout Decaying Skeleton hits you for 39 damage, LODAING...

I as many am on the quest to find my nitch the perfect class for me. Ive gone through tons of them highests being a shaman to 50 and a paladin to 58. I grew tired on the paladin's lack of...just wasent class for me. I would still be playing that shaman but the account was lost, Now im ready to level something different for my new *main*. How is the enchanter class, They look amazing their cround control makes or breaks a group, cool mind buffs and the ability to solo whilst waiting for groups. Im accually told enchanter is the best PoP soloist. Now on creation should i get opinions back, I will either be a HIE or ERU still undecided (just based on looks). Over time as you can imagine i've collected quite a bit of pp about a year ago i *very stupidly* bought about 50k offline. So now im sitting with about 100k in bank to make this character for starts im going for what i belive i need. that being: A horse, EoS,Gef boots and obulus d/s . Is there anything else that is a " must have" ?Also , whats it like being a 65 enchanter? What are our main stats in order i was told , INT&amp;lt;CHA&amp;lt;STA&amp;lt;MANA&amp;lt;HP personly i would put hp higher in the line as im assuming this is a class where I will make the mobs hate me=P.
