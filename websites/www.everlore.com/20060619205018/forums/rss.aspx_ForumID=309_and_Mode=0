I played him to 30+ and now it is getting diffcult to level in DSP. I was wondering where I should hunt as a level 30 Druid, and I would also like opinions on some decent/good armor for a Druid at my level... I have 1 or 2 pieces of Elysian. So if I should stick to Elysian let me know or if anyone has any opinions on armor let me know... Also I have Bone Handled Scimitar. Just wondering if I should get a new weopon... Thanks guys.

1-5 Newb area outside starting city

5-10 Orc hill grouping until you can solo them

10-15 CB in a group

15-20 Paludal Caverns in a recondite bandit group, Fastest exp youll ever see so enjoy it

20-30 Grouping against goblins in HK, nice money, second fastest exp you will see

30-34 Grouping in Ot, hardest part of my leveling, but bear with it, better times are soon to come

34-40 Quadding Dire wolves in Great divide, Very nice exp, plus you get an excellent start on faction for when you start velious thurg quests

40-45 I did the hero bracer quest in stonebrunt mountains, i have heard this to be nerfed so i would suggest grouping In DL through these levels

46-49 Quadding Spectres in Oasis of Mar, excellent exp and even better loot

50-52 or so Quadding Wyverns in Cobalt Scar, very nice exp INSANE loot, made about 1.5 yellow and 400pp an hour here

52-55 Charming ravens and hunting treants or nightstalkers is insane exp, the nightstalkers have extremely nice loot also, made about 1500pp in an hour on the stalkers

There are obviously many many other routes to travel, this is just my own. I would suggest going out and finding your own way, using this and other walkthroughs as guides, not set paths. Learn your character well, taking some help but never getting to your new spell level without learning your previous spells first. Playing your character in a variety of ways, grouping, quadding, and soloing will enable you to learn every aspect and cabability you posess. Also, explore the land, this game was not made to fly through levels just for the purpose of leveling and equipment, there are many places to visit and see, and many friends to meet and help you on your way. These things will help you to enjoy the never ending adventure of everquest, and enable you to flourish in the higher end game, where there is but more surprises and intense situations you will get to be a part of. Best of luck to you in your travels, Have some fun out there.

I am writing this b/c i have searched through so many sites and posts, but have found nothing that is really meant for people who don't know what is going on. most of it will help, but you have to put bits and peice s together. So i am puttig all that i know together and hoping other wth more knowledge than me will add on to the post.

first the levels. 1-5 kill decaying skeletons and spiderlings. Sell everything you get except for bone chips and spiderling silks. For the equipment just use whatever you find or can afford to buy from the vendors withiout spending to much money. Buy all of the bone chips you find. If you can afford to buy spider or spiderling silks then do so. you can turn in bone chi8ps in kaladim for exp and if you want in kaladim. Also, if you find any low quality pelts and can affor them buy them as well.

5-7 kill orc centurions for the belts and spiders for the silks. For the orcs you can turn in the belts. Otherwise just kill anyting that you can.

8-10 go to butcherblock mountains and kill goblins. YOu may level kinda slow, but the plat for goblin heads and vials of blood is to good to pass up. You will need this money.

10-14/15 go to kurns tower. try to get a bind, but it is not neccisary. Go inside and kill whatever you can. at first if you ccan find a group then join them. towards the end you want to try to solo and melle as much as you can without putting yourself in danger to get your defence and offence up. Once again get as many bone chips as you can.

15-24 Go to the paladial caverns. Find a group. at first pretty much all you will do is heal and snare, but both of those are much requestied here, so you should have little problemms finding a group. when you first get ther you will want to have someone show you how to skirt the edges to get around the first village. If you do not go behind the village you will die. 

I don't know where to go from here yet, but when i do find smeplace i will add on.

Now for the money. Whenever you decide you are done for the day go to the Bazaar. If you do not kow where it is you can find it through the nexus. YOu can enter the nexus from nexus portals or through the nexus stone in the POK. You will need a liilt over 1p to buy a traders sachel.Once you have the sachel go to any open area one one of the steps and type in /trader to set up your stand.

Type in /bazaar to search the other vendors and find out how much to sell your wares for. 

My serrver is crowded, so prices are pretty low i think. 
Bone chips sell for about 5g. That is a huge profit margin considering if you can find them they sell for about 5s. 
spider and spiderling silks sell for about 3p apiece. not bad money.
If you have low quality pelts you can combine them with a silk thread to make leather padding that sells for about 15p. very nice progfit margin, but you need to work on tailoring for that.
now for the big money maker....celestial essence.
You can buy celestial solvent from ne of the one of the NPC's for about five s in th bazaar. If you go to the POK you can buy essence of marr for abnout 1.5p. you combine those with a mortar and pestal, which is a no fail combine, and you ahve celestail essence. i sell this for about 5p apiece. that is a profit of 60p per stack. I made 3k off of these in one weeekend.

Also, if you find any medium or high quality pelts they also sell well. 

To find out what price to sell for just do a search for that item and sell for a mid price. 

I have ywt to find other items that sell well, but anyone else who knows, please add on. I know i am more than happy to do the grunt work and sell things if i can make some money to get better equipment.

As for equipment...before 14 you want to get a decent damage weapon and sme items with increased AC. Don't spend to much money on this, even if you can afford to. These levels will pass by quick and you will not need that type of equipment for very long. 
When you get to 14 you want to start looking for focus effect items. The first itme you want is mana conservation, as it decreases mana cost by 10%. i  found earings with this on them for only 35p. Next, as you are a healer in PC most of the time try to find improved healing. Ou can find it for about 100p and it will serve you until level 29. Also, if you can find improve damage 1 then get it, as your 19 level dd will be your best until 29. For the rest of the items, if you want you can find extra wisdom, but don't spend to much on it.

As you start making money you will want to look for focus II items. They will work with all spells till 40
which will take a druid all the way to level 44 spells. You really want mana preservation and all of the afflictions(which work on your DoT spells). If you search carefully you can find some of these for pretty low prices, but some of them are always going to be pretty expensive. Pay the price. focus items are just to good. and they will take you till level 44 before you need to start thinking of upgrading equipment, and by then you should be able to find better ways of making money. For better information about focus items go to castersrealm.com.

If you follow this you will level pretty quick, you will  make good money, and you will have very good equipment for your level.
THis is all of the really good info i have. I know i am a newb, but i know this will help other newbs, and i am hoping others with more knowledge than me can add on so i can learn more as well(that was a thinly disguised plea for help). Soo, add on ore use and happy hunting.</description></item><item><title>newb help with equipment</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/676643/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2004 04:34:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:676643</guid><dc:creator>stranglylucid</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>hi. i am a newb. been playing less than a month, so i have no twinkage. i have a 19 druid with some good startingb gear that i bought at the bazaar.
