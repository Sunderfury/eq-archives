THere is one you need to get with a begging skill of 151+. I have this skill and have talked to the npc however all my info tells me to do is say "please" and I will get the key from Inibi the Confused.  I got nothing.  I have also been told that there is more text you need to say to Inibi, however my guildmate could not remember the text.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about or have the answer?

I know there are much longer 'camps', but I have spent 5 hours (over 2 days) wandering around the maze, killing everything, not a peep from Spinflint.  The zone usually deserted so you can 'camp' the whole zone but with no clue of spawn times or triggers I am not sure if I am just wasteing my time.  Perhaps this drop (or this mob) has been moved else where.

However, going back 3 years, with various chars, I can never recall ever seeing this mob.

Your experiences in this area?  I'd especially like to know of another source for the Whirling Crystal (as would many other's I suspect).

Thanks,

Shaded Amice - has AC of 4 and weight of 0.0 is no drop but looted off a red conned mob to a level 52.

A Torn Luggald Robe - dont remember stats (dont think it had any) but was also looted from a red con to a level 52.

I heard these were both for quest or turnins but cant find information on either. 

Any help would be much appreciated!!!
