Some possible options:

1. Old world only (Hate, Growth, Fear, etc)
2. PoK 
3. PoT (Why just this one though, I have no idea)
4. 1st tier (Justice, Innovation, Nightmare, Disease)
5. 2nd tier (Storms, Valor, etc)
6. 3rd tier (BoT, HoH, etc)
7. 4th? tier (Tactics?, HoHb, Tower of Ro, etc)
8. Elementals
9. Time
10. No planes anywhere, ever.


Or possibly which flags you've gotten:
1. PoJ trials
2. Grummus
3. Helping Askr in PoS
4. The dragon in PoV (AD?)
5. The three trials in HoH (virgins, villagers, and RD)
etc, etc


Just food for though.

  now for the newbies- i know it is hard but don't stop playing this is the last thing you want to do. you should always play the game to the fullest and if you are not helped much, push anyway. giving up is not the way to find why this game is so amazing. so don't give up and if you get confused-calm down and maybe read up n some info and slowly, and i mean slowly figure out what is confusing you and fix. jus remember everquest is a big world and you can not travel it in one day. so we need some newbies to stick with it and improve everquest intead of giving up on it. 
   
   if you read all this thank you pls reply

P.S, if newbies think i'm and uber lvl player i'm not i just love the game i hjave been and uber player but i have also experienced what it is like now to be a newbie.

I have wanted to get everquest for quite some time and i am soon. I want to know what the best choice would be. EQ or EQ2 or EQ online adventures for the PS2. I simply love everquest because it is like another world and i would like to start a dwarf but i'm not sure which type of EQ to pick. People have said EQ2 is much better than EQ and EQOA is growing extremely fast and looks like it has better graphics and is expanding gradually but it has less classes and races than EQ on PC. So if you can give me some advice or help please reply to my question and any reasons or opinions to.</description></item><item><title>History of the game.</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1666214/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2003 21:46:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1666214</guid><dc:creator>Hat of the Madman</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>This may be too complex,as with the poll suggestion that are yet to come from The Hat.
But im suggestion so sit down.listen up,and eat drink,be merry. ok, the history of eq has been set before us and is not influenced by us in any way,we are merely puppets of anothers hand(another that has certificateseses in fields of certain education,i.e multi-media,computer programing etc).Only when a new expansion,eq2,eqoa,etc.Are we open to"new stuff","5oo years before"so forth,but what is the "actaul history of a MMORPG community"? I remeber this one time we rocked guk and killed the king and i was very drunk,ha! or that one time when so and so did this and that,that was a riot!or when everyone in the forum discussed an actual sitiation that occured in-game and this and that happened because of it(:)....but how would a few brave souls make a game that we had real history intertwined with "make beleive history"?...am i gettin anywhere?heh make it so that what happens changes the world,give us the resourses and take notes"i.e. history"thats all there is to it.hire some fiction writers to give us a "hollywood effect" oh but wait,that might just be tooo much envolvment with our"client" ,or "the guys who we gettin money from but we dont even play the game or give a damn about mmorpgs in general other than us makin money"...im sure theres exceptions....i seem to have lost myself,i vote one =D</description></item><item><title>Reform the bestairy by level,not by zone.</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1666212/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2003 21:48:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1666212</guid><dc:creator>Hat of the Madman</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>above.</description></item><item><title>Poll on EQ Customer Service in 2002</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1666210/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2003 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1666210</guid><dc:creator>Venividivici</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>This is for my own curiosity and that is all.

Perhaps a move log.  Perhaps fix the PvP imbalance's.  Perhaps apply some of the rules that apply to Firiona Vie, (communication barriers and more).  Could this possibly draw the crowd back from Dark Age of Camelot (a PvP game) if word got out Verant was "looking into and fixing the sysytem"?  Please post your comments, please state your server you play on.
