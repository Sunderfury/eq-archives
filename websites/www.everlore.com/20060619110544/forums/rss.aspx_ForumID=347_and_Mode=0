Some scum bag bought the char ( Elvina ) and is playing it as her own now.  This new player tried accusing me of screwing over the previous player and another player last night.  I don't know what that was all about - most likely some confusion on the new player's part.  But it concerned me that players like this are in this guild.  What's even worse is Llorunlord and Llorunlist - who have been known to steal the loot from their adv groups are in the guild as well.  I have posted on the web site itself.  But apparently it is monitorred and the post is no longer there.  A friend of mine also witnessed some strange behavior from other players in this guild, and I just wanted to let the decent players of this guild know they should start looking in to a new guild.  NA sucks.  The players I have seen for the most part are ruining this guild, and if you are wise you will get out soon.</description></item><item><title>Where have all the newbies gone</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1205430/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2003 15:20:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1205430</guid><dc:creator>Arcane Arsonist</dc:creator><slash:comments>6</slash:comments><description>I have just returned to everquest after about a year ( yeah I know, major withdraw) but I wanted to play again.

Not too long ago were the days of EC being filled with newbies, not necessarily  bad players, just new characters.

I am glad I created a mage as my first char back because I haven't found one person close to my level.

What most people dont realize is that there are usually 30-50 petitions in the queue at prime-time hours. Most of these taking anywhere from 1min to an hour to "solving". And Ive noticed players complaining that they never get their petitions answered. I can give an answer for this. A guide or GM checks out the petition and sees if the player is on. If not, they check the petition back in the queue. After three times, if the player is not on, the petition is deleted. I hope I have been informative and if you have any questions, dont hesitate to send me an e-mail.

Now that I am back online I play two or three late nights per week..maybe.  I am trying very hard to not lose my life again.  I left after a nasty divorce and do not want to fall into the addiction..

Anyway I play a couple nights per week and there is vertually no one in the zones I play.  Where did everyone go?
