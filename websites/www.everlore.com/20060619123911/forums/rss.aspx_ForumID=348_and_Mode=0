I have learned alot from the guys i work with that play, there a 7 of us total. We threw the idea of starting a guild up around but im not interested, i would like to join an already established, well respected guild, with Mature members. I feel im missing something the game has to offer by not being in a guild, like the raids,tips,experience,friendships and just having a bud or two to play with. I have a few characters on Saryn which are:
Klahhz Oshammee lvl 29 Shaman
phatjack lvl 14 Mage
Shadowfyst lvl 19 Monk
Nekcrow lvl 7 Necromancer
Shadowca lvl 8 Shadowknight

As for info on me im 32, happily married with 3 great kids and a 15 year military man. I am new to EQ but not to MMORPG, i am a humourous guy who loves to have a good time and i play well with others :)
LOL why do i feel like i just filled out a personals add for a dating service? I also like long walks on the beach and candlelit dinners hahahahaha

Well if there is anyone out there that is interested in taking me in to the fold give me a yell ingame or email me at phat_jacks@yahoo.com

My question to you, then, is this:  Why are you here?

For some of us, this server is HOME.  Saryrn has been my EQ home for a year and a half.  I've considered other servers, but the people I know and enjoy being with are on Saryrn.  For those that have only negative things to say, why bother?  Go to another server if you don't like this one.  And if you aren't currently playing on this server, please save bandwidth and your own energy for something a little more positive than slamming.

I'd really enjoy seeing a little more (positive) action on Saryrn related forums.  It would be great to have someplace OOG to chat with folks, and plan groupings.</description></item><item><title>want to sale</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1206792/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2003 22:39:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1206792</guid><dc:creator>innydeep the glarelord</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>howdy i want to sale a savage stone axe)(tantors tusk)(wild lords crown)(shieldstrom)(swramcaller)(and sk spell zavfeers bite)(        </description></item><item><title>isengard</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1206770/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2003 19:44:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1206770</guid><dc:creator>kormen</dc:creator><slash:comments>22</slash:comments><description>first OFF isengard is a wnna be TWC guild they suck they think they are uber when they really arent i have been KSed by those sapps for along time</description></item><item><title>More children who certainly act that way?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1206761/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2002 21:01:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1206761</guid><dc:creator>Happy_Guy</dc:creator><slash:comments>9</slash:comments><description>Is it just me or do a lot of people on our server act like children and try to bully from behind their keyboards?  I will only cite one example and it is a rather annoying example, but it is only one of MANY examples of the dredge of players that are (unfortunately) gaining higher levels.

I myself have only two characters that are above level 30.  I spend quite a bit of time in South Karana and know if quite well.  I currently solo Tecsh Mas Gnolls at the spires for relatively stress-free albeit somewhat slow XP gain.  I've grouped in HPK and Paw but usually find that the gain is faster and less stress-inducing while soloing outside.  Don't think that I don't like grouping, but I spend most of my time online talking to another guildmate on the phone while playing.  In groups this is iffy at best and usually results in me standing around looking like I'm comatose due to trying to pay attention to too many things.  When not on the phone I love to group.

Now, on the annoying story.  While soloing the hill in South Karana someone shouts that they want to know if Brother Qwinn is up and they offer a 2pp reward for a location.  I (of course, since I'm soloing AND always trying to have fun and poke fun at EQ) reply with a comment about 2pp being a great bounty if you're ready to die by Brother Qwinn's hand.  Basically, if 2pp is all you an afford, then methinks Brother Qwinn would whoopa you good.  Several people in the zone agreed with me immediately.  Of course this totally pissed off the 42 Iksar Monk who obviously can't take a joke, but the guy /shouting in the first place was only level 29 or so.

So, why is this a stupid and annoying story?  Well, the 42 Iksar Monk had his 29 druid friend track me.  They found me about two minutes after I stated that they would most likely be killed by Brother Qwinn.  I was soloing many, many gnolls and at the time they found me I was engaging yet another runner at the hill.  I had about 5 mana (enough for a Yaulp) and almost two whole life bubbles left.  I'm level 32 when this happens.  So I have maybe 250hp give or take.  I'm a Half-Elf Paladin so hit points aren't my strong suit. =)  So Iksar boy, WHILE I'm getting beat up by this gnoll, and kind of losing, /duels me and says, "let's do thiz thang! =p"....

To which I replied, "If you haven't noticed, I am a tad busy at the moment."

So the big bad Iksar 42 monk wanted to duel someone 9 levels lower than him simply because he offered 2pp for a location and got zinged.  Ok, he wouldn't have even gotten zinged in the first place had he offered NO bounty.  In fact the day before at the south spire I actually saw Brother Qwinn FIVE times AND shouted every time I saw him!  Of course, no one that I noticed needed him at the time, but Cie La Vie I guess, eh?

So it all comes down to, and I really hate to have to say this, but the STUPID, RETARTED, LOSERS who you NEVER would have hoped got out of Oasis of Marr because they couldn't group or fight worth a plugged nickel have somehow figured out how to get past level 30 and now 40.

The only problem with this?  I keep telling my friend whom I talk on the phone with while playing that the people, generally the higher in level you go, DON'T take themselves THAT seriously AND are nice, as far as I've seen anyway up until now, AND almost always result in a pleasant experience.

I hope that this is the last of these said encounters or I may return to the "spooky quietness" of Anarchy Online.... simply because I don't have to listen to it.</description></item><item><title>Kedge Robe</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1206760/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2002 12:50:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1206760</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>Looking to buy MQ for Quill. send tell to terana or zilazo in game or email me at ecarpenter@striglos.com</description></item><item><title>HACKER ALERT!</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1206759/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2002 03:44:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1206759</guid><dc:creator>3V3RQU35T GURU</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>If you happen to run across a player named Byes, do not give him any buffs, items, or money and do not attempt to befriend him or trade with him!
