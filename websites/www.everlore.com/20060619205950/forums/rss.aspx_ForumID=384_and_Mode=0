We killed an npc and I rolled and won the head of the prince.

Does anyone know were to find the information for the epic on this item?  They said it was for an enchanter epic.

I've been on one raid before, but lost the roll on the boy's head.  I know the hardest part is just getting TO him.  I was wondering if anyone could provide me with some help on the tricks to getting there.  I think I want to remember a trap/lock on/near the bridge?? And I was told to have all my stuns up..  Chain stun is a tactic to keep handy in case of emerg??  Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated...
