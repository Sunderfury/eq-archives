Make good on your promise man.  Keep us on our toes.  Or are your threats blank?  Can we actualy do anything that we want?  Without consequences?  It has been my experience that that is the case.  I was harrased a while back by a "mysterious" person.  I ask you how can they be "mysterious"?  When you post on this site, you download a cookie that holds your computers pin number.  Mods may not even know this, but just to show the post it must be done.  So with that in mind annon poeple shouldn't be allowed to get away with this kind of thing.  OK now tell me, if somebody was harrasing me, isn't is logical to say that they have an account on here somewere, and they were hidding behind an annon mask?  Why was no account baned?  I only ask this because it was a test of a few of my friends.  I know who "harrased" me.  He has an account and everything.  I am coming to the conclusion that anything done by a mod is a cover-up or a blank threat.  They don't want us to feel harassed, but don't do anything to stop it.  Well that's my thoughts.  Remeber don't look down on kids, I'm 16, and I was able to come up with that thought string.  May your actions be your words.  Be a promise keeper.  Ban me for that will show affirmative action by mods.  I would actualy feel saffer if you did.  Knowing that you deal with bad people.  Lock my out for a bit.  Amen.</description></item><item><title>Correct me if I'm wrong</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1665204/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2003 00:49:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1665204</guid><dc:creator>Ranger of the Forests</dc:creator><slash:comments>14</slash:comments><description>These server boards are useless.

This is my lvl 42 ranger and what he is wearing.  I am just getting back to the game afer a cpl month break and am looking to upgrade.  Any suggestions.  And I know that I need to upgrade my weapons really badly.

Ranger, you know that we've fought together before and I respect you, but get out of the casinos dude.  You will get ignored by 9 out of 10 people.  and your rep goes down the crapper.  Just make your money by farming, if nothing else.  Go to DSP until you get lvl 40 and then go with a friend and farm in runnyeye or Unrest or Splitpaw or something.

By way of lvling.  I know it is completely unorthodox, but Unrest has/may still be empty.  I got a full grp together and we hunted the basement.  We started in the big room and worked our way all the way to the very bottom.  I was gaining a lvl every 2 hours all the way up until lvl 40.  It's real solid loot too.  

But PLEASE, stop the casino.  I know that there are people stupid enough to throw away money, but don't be stupid enough to throw away your reputation.

How do you come by the money to buy all of a druid's spells?  I just barely was able to by his level 19 spells (still have to get the last 19 ring) and threw that forked out over 200 pp.  Should I pick up opal encrusted steins?  I have been trying to offer my services as a buffer and healer to random people for donations.  As I have 159 wisdom I get into groups quite easily and often have a lot of mana to spare on poor travelers.  If anybody has any advise at all for me it woudl be greatfully appreciated.

It is a realy good guild.  They do raids and stuff and even let me and a few of my friends set up a lowbie raid from level's 30-40.  If you want more information about it you can always go to &lt;A HREF="http://t-a-o.net/" TARGET="_BLANK"&gt;http://t-a-o.net/&lt;/A&gt; it is a realy cool site and it tells a lot about the guild.  Was just wondering if I was the only one from their.  I am kind of new to the guild.  The guild members are mostly level 55-65 and they help lowbies like me a lot.

As a side note do you all look down on me because I have a casino?  Because all you have to do to make the spam from my casino go away is to turn ooc off.  I don't spam the other 2 channels unless the ooc people tell me to stop bothering them.  I am actualy better than they other casino's, they use shout whice realy stands out and hurts people's eyes late at night.  Oh and just because I say something doesn't mean that you have to listen to it.  What are you looking for on ooc anyways?  Everybody always auctions on the auction channel not the ooc channel.</description></item><item><title>I've been leveling fast... what next?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1665170/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2003 03:59:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1665170</guid><dc:creator>Ranger of the Forests</dc:creator><slash:comments>15</slash:comments><description>I've been leveling quite quickly lately.  Gained from 31-33 in about 3 hours in HHK and have quickly become one of the strongest tanks in the WR (I have a centi shortsword, and a sarnek flesh harvester) I have about 1000 pp so I am slowly working my way up to what it will cost for a centi LS.  Where should I go now?  Exp late at night is still good for me (12 pm, 1 group gets stairs, WR and RR WOOOOOT!!!!!!!) but I feel durring the day as if I am starting to outgrow teh level.  Me and my friend, a level 35 paladin are able to duo the RR quite well and I am able to gain about a level in an hour and a half like that but that will start to slow down after I hit about 35.  So my question is.  Should I solo RR, should I kill guards, or should I move on?  And if I am to move on, where should I go?  I hear their are good places on the moon.  Can anybody give me some sudgestions?</description></item><item><title>Looking for Guild</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1665164/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2003 01:25:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1665164</guid><dc:creator>I'm Bored</dc:creator><slash:comments>6</slash:comments><description>46 warrior on Vazelle server 2k hp unbuffed 200 skill in all combat skills post here for reply please
