My rogue is now 52, and I've never really paid attention to lockpicking, but now some friends and I want to do an xp evening in Seb and the leader is saying we need me to pick a lock to get into the basement area?

Is there somewhere I can go to get my lockpicking skill up fairly simply? :)

I've heard Befallen is a spot to try?</description></item><item><title>Ldon help.</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/811138/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2004 09:32:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:811138</guid><dc:creator>Poromen</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>I've been having problems with Ldon chests barrels boxs vases you know all that crap, I can sense the traps, disarm them but it wont let me open them, ive tried to use the open thing on abilities, and ive tried to bring out lockpicks and all that, so i end up just beatin the hell out of it, any advice?

All the rogue epic guides talk about the general takeing a minumum raid force of 72 people, i was wondering with the new level limit of 65 and current gear if this is still true today. How many average to elemental players would it take today to take him down? Thanks in advance for any replies and maybe this board could get going again :)

The reality of it is that anyone's question about the game is valid, and if you don't feel like answering it, or if you think it's stupid or lazy to ask, then ::dramatic buildup:: don't respond to it.

This site is a resource, and all of you that are so fond of telling people to go do some research should perhaps consider that to them, they ARE doing research, in the best way they know... by asking players that they respect and look up to.  How do you respond?  By mocking them and telling them to look elsewhere and not waste your time.  If there's a better site for their question you could tell them. But no.. then you couldn't belittle them in some sick attempt to compensate for your own freakish insecurity.

And you all wonder why traffic is down and responses are slow.. it's because so many of you are hateful little weasels.  In fact, it seems frighteningly clear that some of you.. [I won't name names (giant cat)] have nothing better to do than to go to every forum and tear apart everyone you can get your hands on.  You people hurt the game, you hurt the site, and you hurt the community.  

Have a great day, or die trying!

Sincerely,
A representative of the community

PS- Don't bother responding to this with some spiteful comment because I won't be returning to read it.</description></item><item><title>Quick Question</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/811110/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2004 15:06:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:811110</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>10</slash:comments><description>Hola, 

I was told that there is basicly 2 types of rogues.

Offensive and Defensive. I am aimming to honestly ,

and this being my first character I dont have tons 
of money to not know :) Also my second question ....
I am dualing 2 pierce weapons a fabled dragoon dirk ,
and a normal dragoon dirk. I was wondering if this is wise..? I have a fabled screaming mace and have been using that to keep skill points up sorta :( but restorted back to the pierce since it hits more {maxed out so far}. I appreciate any info and sorry so sloppy at work.

Break it down into level sections if you need to, like who does more damage at lvl 20, 40, 60, and 65.</description></item><item><title>Woads</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/811092/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2004 06:02:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:811092</guid><dc:creator>BarbRogue</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>What's with Barbarian woads?
