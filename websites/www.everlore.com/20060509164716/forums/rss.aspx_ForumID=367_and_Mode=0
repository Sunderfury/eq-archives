It is better to be an Enchanter doing this trade since making Magic Jewery requires enchanted metals. This skill is soo great becuase even high level players will dish out tons of money to buy your fine items. For example, Platinum Ruby Veil can go for over 1,000Platinum. It is a costly trade to learn though.</description><dc:language>en-US</dc:language><generator>CommunityServer 1.1 (Build: 1.1.0.50615)</generator><item><title>something useful</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1267090/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2005 14:11:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1267090</guid><dc:creator>Inex</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>How about posting something actually helpful about JC on here rather than argueing , god damn.</description></item><item><title>Mid level Cost issues</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1267085/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2005 14:21:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1267085</guid><dc:creator>Irondeer</dc:creator><slash:comments>5</slash:comments><description>This goes out to those of you who have struggled through the "mid" level selling, I have a Enchanter 24, who has finaly mastered gold...only to find things selling strangely in the bazaar...

Ok...So how are we to sell things at reasonable prices to PC's if they can get better drop items?

I dont know about your servers, but mine seems to be full of "better" equip. that is flooded the market.

My Chanter stands there with Str+3's at barely above makeing cost &lt;and I mean Barely!&gt; and gets outsold by the guy selling the ork earrings and the forest loops he spent the day farming......

Any hope in the future for actualy getting payed back for the skill? or should I just sell back to the vendor and go on?

LOL!

It is as simple as this enchanters do enchanted jewelry crafting, the druids/cleric/and shamans get to do imbued jewelry.

For the rest of ya'll that wont to do JC anyway
you have a rough road ahead of you, you will not make enough pp to support yourself unless you have an endless supply of ca$h flow. like from a main char or something.

I myself have a lvl 37 chanter that is a jewelry crafter for enchanted jewelry
and a lvl 39 druid that does imbued jewelry.

The hole reason Verant put imbued gems into the game was to stop this ongoing feud and balance out the game.

I am writting this in hopes that everyone finally relizes that the hole arguement is just stupid.

Everyone will probably still fight as usuall after they read this but at least i tryed.

I swear I do better without stat buffs than with them.  I'm not talking hitpoint and a/c buffs, but buff like DEX and STR.

I'm a Rogue so I love getting the Shammy buffs.  When fully buffed I'm maxed out at 255 on both STR and DEX.
My normal STR and DEX are 236 and 216.

Now you'd think that with the maxed STR and DEX I'd be doing noticibley higher and more consistent damage.

Exactly the opposite is true.  When I am fully buffed I have more misses and less powerfull backstabs.  As soon as the buffs wear off, my damage and accuracy improve.  

What the heck?  Anyone else notice this.  At first I thought maybe I was just interpreting things wrong, because I wasn't really watching the damage window that closely.  But last night I made it a point to pay attention to what was happening, and there was a very noticible change.

This trade skill is THE skill to have in the game.

(all Classes can make jewelry but enchanters will probable end up making more money then other class making Jewelry, due to the fact that enchanters can lower there service price much more then others cause, most other classes have to pay enchanters to enchant there metal, and would end up going in the hole if they lowered there Jc prices to enchanter standards)

but if your a non-enchanter and have a good money resource other then JC, by all means JC away.

 Making the supply naturally lower than say smithing.. Less supply of quality jewlery means higher prices, and profits. Where else can you consistiently make a 33-50% profit per item made?

Now, in the "silver" phase, the beginning enchanter is in the mode of investment for the future, early silver jewlery is not that easy to sell because most low level characters are in the same boat as you are, no money yet.. So, don't bother enchanting metal that you use to make the early jewlery, it just wastes time. As you probably already now know, sell it back to the merchants. You won't make a profit here, but the key is the skill gain.. 

With that in mind, all you have to do now is find some source of cash to fund your fledgling craft. i had a farely good cash flow for a newbie in 
g-faydark/crushbone gathering cb (crush bone) belts and pads from orc Centrons and orc legenairs. and selling them to newbie/lowbie players 1pp each for belts and 2pp each for pads so they can go do an exp. quest in kaladim

 if you are lets say... an evil race and a highly intelligent enchanter, you should be able to find some kind of cash flow.

From one enchanter to another, I hope you hang with it, and someday you will thank me.

I have a level 34 Enchanter with a skill level of 238 in Jewelcraft.  The reason I don't think it is a good idea for non Enchanters to be Jewelers is you cannot compete on prices.  While I was raising my skill I flooded the Bazaar with the level I was working on.  My main goal was to raise my skill and if I made a little money that was great.  As a result I sold in large volumes at a low price.  These volumes allowed me to raise my skill and still cover the cost of my failures.  Anyone who paid even a low price for the enchanting would not be able to break even.  Another problem you will have, that will not become apparent until you are in deep, is that it is fairly easy to find someone to enchant silver, electrum, and even gold for a small cost or even free.  Once you get to platinum things change.  As a level 34 Enchanter there is no way I am going to spend 20 minutes enchanting platinum bricks unless you pay me great money.  I'll give you Clarity or any other buff I have for free, but these bricks are a whole diffrent story.  I hate taking the time to enchant them for myself.  People say mana is free, but for a pure caster, that is the biggest consumer of my time.  And in reality the only true thing of worth in the game is play time.  So that is my 2 cents.  There are many crafts out there.  Most seem to go hand in hand with diffrent classes.  It would be better to chose one that would be a better fit.  But if you insist that you know better, be my guest.  Just don't complain when your Enchanter buddy who used to enchant stuff for free is no longer playing the game as much.  And you find yourself paying 200PP to get a stack of platinum bars enchanted.</description></item><item><title>Great Offer For A Free Jewlery Guide</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1267062/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2003 16:07:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1267062</guid><dc:creator>Lusint of luclin server</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>WANT A GREAT JEWELRY CRAFTING GUIDE?

If your bored, grab a bite to eat or something, work on a trade skill, or just travel and talk to friend(if you have any) so you need to just shut-up about "This is why enchatner's don't enchant for free!" cuz guess what??? SOME DO.
