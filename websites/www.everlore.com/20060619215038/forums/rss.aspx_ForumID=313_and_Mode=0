I can research it and I am currently collecting words, but my research skill is only in the mid 20s (it sucks). My guildmasters say that they can't train me anymore, and I don't want to waste my collection of words on a lot of failed attempts. My Book of Dark Bindings shows some practice formulas but I haven't a clue how this works. I've looked around (even at Necrotalk.com) to find some glimmer of what to do, but researching has become a pain because I'm working blind. Can anyone either give me a clue how they improved their research skill or at least suggest some site that talks about practice runes/words in better detail than I've found. It's frustrating banging my head against this new wall. Thanks.</description></item><item><title>Feign Death</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/733363/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2005 22:49:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:733363</guid><dc:creator>Bloodancer</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>Greetings fellow caster's of undead magik.  Thanks for your help on my last post.  I have recently reached the level of 20, and was wondering about my fiegn death spell.  I was running through the feild of bone today and got ambushed by a lesser char bone skelenton, being that I was not in a state to fight him I feigned death, but he kept attacking me.  Needless to say I was slain very quickily.  My question is why was it able to attack me when I casted the spell?  Any help would be nice.

peace out

Sorry but I refuse to pay that much for a level 56 Necro spell, especially when I can get the level 60 spell way cheaper. But considering that I am not yet 60, I really could use that spell, if anyone might know where I can farm words of awareness, it would be very helpful.

Got my Warrior to 65, Uber decked out, as one other Warrior said "he has so many hps it makes you want to cry". 
Well back to Necromancer for fun, on one of my other accounts. I have figured out how to level to 35 without actually playing. What I need to continue is a mob that gives decent exp, is a solo spawn with slow spawn time, and one my pet can kill while the mob beats on me.
Necromancer is obviously a hard class (laugh) when exploits exist like this. It is even legal according to SOE (I have died twice I must admit, my only 2 deaths so far) because there is some danger.
Any ideas on good spawns to do this on? Obviously I will have summoned Mage gear, and have over 1200hps unbuffed at 35.</description></item><item><title>What places have bonus experiences?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/733338/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2004 18:29:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:733338</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>8</slash:comments><description>I know that Kunark has a 10% extra bonus exp per kill.

I know at least a handful of dark blue mobs give 1% per kill, yet hit like sissies compared to the stuff in PoN.  They're also somewhat stupid mobs and don't have a large agro radius.  However, there's plenty of wanderers to make up for that.  Can anyone offer a suggestion for good spots to pull or kite, or is it easier to stick to root rot?

Stats are: Cha: +2 Int: +4 Fire Resist: +5 Magic Resist: +2 HP: +16 Mana: +16.

Easy to make and all the components are at the Abysmal Sea love boat.  Fish up some tuna, brew up some beer batter (95 brew), and cook up the sandwhiches (132 baking).  The great thing is that this is really cheap stat food.  If your baking isn't high enough, keep making fish rolls from all the fresh fish you catch while learning to fish.

I have a stack of 5 or so in my inventory that I slide into place before going on a mission.  I stuff myself on fish rolls to prevent munching on stat food.
