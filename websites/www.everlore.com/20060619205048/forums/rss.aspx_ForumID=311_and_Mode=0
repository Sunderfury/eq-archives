I recently did the 4 quests in Najena for the Focus Items (Shovel, Stein, Torch &amp; Broom) for pets. Can anyone tell me...

1) How do the items affect the pets?

2) Do you have to be holding the item when you cast the pet?

3) Once cast, do you have to continue to hold the item or are the bonuses only used when casting the pet?

Any and all information on this would be greatly appreciated!

LVL 29 CLERIC
LVL 29 MAGE
LVL 15 RANGER
LVL 30 ROGUE
LVL 25 WARRIOR

I wanted to get a good feel for a handfull of classes then take one, possibly two, into the high end of the game.

I'm looking for any opinions on what class I should choose. I know the whole, only you can decide thing, but I am really having a tough time deciding and would like some input from people that have already been to the high end.

some notes:

CLERIC: Having so much responsibility is cool. Auto-group is also very nice : )/ can get very repetitive.

MAGE: PETS ROCK!!, summoning stuff for people is cool too./it's so annoying how you can't just quickly melee a green mob away if you dont have your pet up or he is occupied.

RANGER: Tracking, Fletching, Archery, TIGHT!!/ kinda tough to find a group.

ROGUE: Hide and sneak is sweet, massive amounts of damage non-stop in a group, BACKSTAB!!/ no soloing capability whatsoever, no spells : (

WARRIOR: Gotta love all the attention you get from being main tank : ), taunting mobs off others and beating them down is very fun, non-stop action/ soloing is pretty much not an option, no spells : (

Theres the notes : )
Any opinions on this would be great, especially end game info, THANKS A BUNCH : )</description></item><item><title>So sorry to ask but...</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/700291/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2004 04:38:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:700291</guid><dc:creator>Ibuna</dc:creator><slash:comments>8</slash:comments><description>     I haven't seen any explanation of pet spells and I was wondering; What is the best pet for a person who is nuke crazy and scared to group?

Did you all know that you DON'T need to practice spell research but instead every time you level you can put points into it?? 

If not, give it a try. I finally max'd my research out at 200 recently from just training points into it...made my life sooo much easier. 

Good luck!

Do the Mages have to do any damage to get all the XP? 1% damage? 50% damage?

I've checked the forum here but can't fid anything up to date about this.  I have seen comments about the "pet xp thing" having been removed and also the class xp penalties being removed.

Are either of these true?

Just a brief answer will be fine lol, there are far more interesting threads on here after all!

I am a level 12 mage and to put it bluntly I am bored.

I am High Elf so started in Felwithe/Faydark area. I am untwinked, I have done the armour quest including getting the unhelpful staff just to have something to do but what do I do now?   I have searched the web looking to see what quests I can take on but most available to my level just give me items I cannot use and the Mage quests are for players at a much higher level.

I suppose it boils down to two questions

1) Are there quests that are worth a level 12 High Elf Mage doing anywhere on the map?

2) Are there places I can go to kill mobs to better armour or weapons?  I know I can get a better dagger (Dragoon) off D'Vinn in crushbone when I a few levels higher.  Any other suggestions?

BTW, I have about 100pp and do not own any expansions yet. Actually I am still on the 30 day trial which is why I am asking; so far I have been kept glued to the PC playing EQ but now as my trial subscription is about to die I have reached a dull patch. Bad timing :)   Maybe Sony should give a bit of thought to how high a player is likely to have gone after 30 days and whether the game is still gripping enough at that level to make them subscribe.</description></item><item><title>Pets?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/700247/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2003 00:51:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:700247</guid><dc:creator>Super killer</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>What lvl do mages pets start to look cool besides just little floating triangles?
