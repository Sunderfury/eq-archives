First, it is a difficult class to level.  I know there are those out there that can take any character and get to 30 in just a few days, but I have had days where I worked hard and only got 1 lvl.  You must do like someone said, be a Paladin and love it.  Stick with it.  

Second, I have played other games, i.e. War Craft, and the Paladin was the best fighter in the game.  With this in mind, I do believe that the Sony gods really need to turn the Paladin into a Holy Warrior.  Give him some powerful weapons with easily attainable heavy duty armor and a few really good healing and damage spells.

Third, if you are going to keep your pally, upgrade your armor as quickly as possible.  Also, get temp/virtue and kei along with your own spell of Divine Purpose(which is a mana to hp spell) and become the best tank possible.  I love to do it on a raid or Ldon.

The Paladin is hard to play, because it is not a spellcaster/healer, but not a warrior either.

Good luck and safe hunting.

(can solo in POI with np) I know the new day and age mob's and zones are much easier. Compared to the new day and age how hard would you rate the lich in everfrost caves. I have heard of pallies soloing him. I just do want to fail with this turn in. I was think like 3 to 5 peps lvl 65 one being me (65pally) 65 chanty and 65 clr would that be enough or?.
Also
Im also ready for the  turn in for the AV in P O sky. do I need to take a raid with me a grp or can me and say a 65 bst bro do this. the POS keys are no longer no rent and i have the keys all the way to the 5th island in the bank so would have to kill anything other than if argoed. could i just use all my keys and go up invis and do turn in with no argo or what?
