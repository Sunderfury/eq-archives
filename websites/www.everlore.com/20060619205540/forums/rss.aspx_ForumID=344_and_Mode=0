I am interested in a server to server trade of resources. I am now playing on The Nameless but I used to play on Prexus. If anyone here has resources on The Nameless they would like to profit from, I would like to talk about a deal. On Prexus, I have several nice items (nothing way uber, but nice) that I just hate to walk away from if I can somehow trade them. For instance, I have 10+ Deluxe Sewing Kits, a good amount of plat, and some nice armor and weapons. 

You can reply to me here, or via email.

Thanks

I've been reading these forums for a good 2-3 months now ( restarted my EQ account after doing 9 months military training ),  and almost every post having to do with anything that MIGHT be controversial (sp?) or sexist or in any AMERICAN ( that whole freedom of speech thing ) ,  YOU have put in yer two sense about how WRONG it is, then killed the Topic.  You have done this on atleast 5 posts that I have read in the past hour ( waiting for patch of course ). 
So, to get to the point,  COULD YOU PLEASE QUIT YER BITCHING ?  WE really don't care ! We might argue back with you like we care about what you have to say, but alas, its only in hopes to shut you up, or even try to teach you the blindness of your retaliations.

Note: please excuse run-on sentances and CAPS
P.S. I do realize the whole hypocritical part about Free Speech

TO SUMMARIZE:
- Shut up, we don't care
- Keep Replies on Subject
- Women are not the dominate sex in the human race, live with it, if you can't, pretend to be a... black widow spider..
- People who make a big deal about nothing cause the world to suck ( that guy who wants "under god" out of the pledge for example, your no better than him )
- EQ is addictive, it is a game, but in the future ALL games will be like EQ, all MMORPG's and the like


RELATED SUBJECT: EQ 2  means no char transfers, what will happen then ? EQ 1 loyalists staying forever ? or a mass cleansing that is needed when everyone moves to EQ 2 ???    I can't wait till that release !!! heehhe</description></item><item><title>I got scammed.

She made it sound like she was going to offer me a lot of money for it. I put all of my gear in the trade window, and my singing steel and wakizashi of the frozen skies in a bag so it would all fit. She /Qed out, but I thought she just went linkdead. She came back and told what order to arrange the items in in the trade window. I thought she just wanted to make sure it would all fit in her inventory so it would all go in the correct bags. Then she /Qed out again, the bag with my singing steel fell to the ground and her other character picked it up and ran away. I talked to a GM about it and he was useless. Later that day I talked to a wizard who said the same thing happened to him, and the same person scammed him. I ended up losing my armor and weapons that I spent 30 levels working to get. If you don't want this to happen to you, then when trading, do not put bags and loose items in the trade window together, if the loose items go in a main slot instead of another bag then there will be no room for the bags. When someone just cancels a trade then any items that there aren't room for will go on your cursor, if the person goes linkdead though, the items will go the ground. Oh well, I don't think I am going to play my bard much anymore, nothing to look forward to when you lose all of your good armor and weapons, I'll have to play my 12th level SK, Torklin then.</description></item><item><title>what is the safest way to get frum qeynos to F.P. for a lvl 12</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1183055/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2002 14:59:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1183055</guid><dc:creator>krn164</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>i am a lvl 12 mnk in qeynos becuase my guild suposedly had an event and i want to know the safest way besides a port . to get back to Freeport</description></item></channel></rss>
