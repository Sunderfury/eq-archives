I have played Anarchy Online, FFXI, and EQOA but nothing comapred to EQ back in the old days.

For me, to see EQ in the shape it is now is shocking. It is like living in New York or LA then leaving for a few years and coming back to find it in ruins.

When I played, EQ was massive. These boards were full of life. What has happend? Is WoW really that good?

It's funny to me to see all these people talking about the birth of MMORPG's related to WoW. How can you forget Everquest? After three years, I  havn't.</description></item><item><title>Everquest: 40 Secrets for Making Unlimited Platinum</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/2018100/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2006 19:43:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:2018100</guid><dc:creator>eqmethods</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><description>&lt;P&gt;Everquest: 40 Secrets for Making Unlimited Platinum&lt;/P&gt;

It's been a while since I went looking for EQ stuff on the web and I landed here. I was the "original" owner of a lvl 60 (was the highest back then ) Shaman named Deezel Fuuled. I was in the guild Sphere of Transcendence and before that, Vision. Just seeing those names brings back memories. Such as great times, great laughs, looooong days and nights, lost friends, lost jobs.....haha but still great. Anyway, I sold my account when my computer crashed and when I got a new one, I figured the computer crashing was a sign to walk away. I'm curious if anyone from back in those days still hangs around. I remember many names and many guilds however I don't want to start naming them because I'll be here for hours. If there's anyone who was on Ayonae Ro from about 2000 to 2004, post a reply.</description></item><item><title>Can someone help me find EQ Map Downloads?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/2018039/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2006 22:16:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:2018039</guid><dc:creator>Rileddarie</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>I know you used to be able to download in game maps from eqtoolbox.com or from mapfiend.com.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now, apparently those sites are no longer working.&amp;nbsp; Does anyone know where else you can find downloadable in game maps?&amp;nbsp; I've hunted far and wide on the internet and not found a thing.&amp;nbsp; Any help and/or input would be greatly appreciated.</description></item><item><title>Regarding mistakes with coleadership</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/2018012/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2006 10:02:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:2018012</guid><dc:creator>Fearywoman</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800080&gt;Okies might have sounded good about coleadership : but this is a story i am telling you to warn you of this happening . me and my bestfriend is leaders of a guild on cazic thule server we recently got a direct tell from another guildleader wanting to merge with us .. Have our guild swallow his and him to become a &amp;lt;Coleader&amp;gt; with us .. well sounded great having more people in guild better raids ect so we agreed he in the mean time kept his guild on the old one and put it on a alt .. He got whole guild over to our he said about 50 players but he didnt know ended up about 25 max anyway still nice people very sweet .. Weel later i seen one of his guildies trying to remove herself from my guild i sent her a tell asking her what was up? if there was anything wrong or if she just wasnt happy. So said no that her GL informed her to leave and get old guild ready he was leaving shortly to come back to other guild.. Just then i recieved Alot of tells saying there was a guy in guild who left guild and was recruiting them to old guild .. Needless to say this was a scam .. he joined our guild to recruit people out of mine to his thinking he could make his guild stronger. then finally when i confronted him he said if course it was a lie caused i scene in guildchat and pulled out .. leaving alot of my guildies wondering and many of em just disbanding due to fighting that went on in guild.. after this he begged me if he could please stay in officer&amp;nbsp; channel in my guild LOL i told him no he got offended ,, I recently sent screen shots off to sony declaring sabatage .. and have petitioned like crazy but these sick people might just create another toon and do the same to another guild .. Just wanted to tell everyone beware of scams there even in guilds .. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description></item><item><title>Discounted Platinum and Premade Characters</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/2017990/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2006 17:25:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:2017990</guid><dc:creator>CheapPlat</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><description>Http://www.bargain-platinum.com Cheap platinum and premade characters.

It was the one where You could see Norrath from Luclin as it was setting behind some mountains.  But here's my question... If you can see all the different continents on Norrath from Luclin, then why did it take them so long to find Taelosia?  Honestly all they had to do was say "Hey look a continent!  I've never been there, let's go somehow."  But instead they ignored this big unmapped continent in the middle of the ocean.  That was my question, why couldn't they just see Tealosia?
