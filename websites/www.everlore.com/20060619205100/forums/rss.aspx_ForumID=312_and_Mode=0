They are limited to Hand to hand combat which makes it so they cannot use many great weapons. They are very limited on armor (Leather) which makes the monk take more damage when hit. They can counter this by having the ability to avoid many hits during combat.</description><dc:language>en-US</dc:language><generator>CommunityServer 1.1 (Build: 1.1.0.50615)</generator><item><title>FD help</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/716163/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2004 18:26:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:716163</guid><dc:creator>mebaztiz</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>I was wondering if anyone could help me in setting up a hotbutton that would enable me to FD, then stand back up then FD again. thanks alot</description></item><item><title>can't handle this</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/716167/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2005 16:05:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:716167</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>Death's fist

   Hey. It has been forever since I have played EverQuest and especially since I have played my Monk. I have seen post about this on different sites and things, and I was just wondering if there is a site where I can find more about the phantom line of attacks for monk and what they do? Just reply here please. Thanks and bye.

Break it down into level sections if you need to, like who does more damage at lvl 20, 40, 60, and 65.</description></item><item><title> help!! please!!</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/716145/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2004 15:53:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:716145</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>6</slash:comments><description>I have a 52 monk but my armor sucks... i got almost all acrylia with like an orc fang earing =(, (the other ear has somthing some random dude gave me but its one of the nicer items i have lol) a chitinous belt,  a cloak i won in LDoN (has like 8 str 5 dex and some hps not bad). I really want to replace some of this stuff because my overall stats are only something like 
str 163 sta 144 dex 116 agi 109 
my weapons arn't too good either. i have an entrenched steel baton 14 damage 28 delay and a club thats 15dmg 25 delay procs for 60 but not too often and it weighs like 3lbs so i would like to find something lighter
Any way my question is where can i find some better armor i am too poor to buy stuff in the bazaar and if you can't help me find some armor could you suggest some places to hunt for PP and what to buy once i get the $ any advice would help.

It actually looks like they could be a soloing machine now. They have Disc that heal them, add serious DPS, tanking Disc and lull. 

However, after looking at them some of them have pretty long reuse times and last a very short duration.

I am primary interested in the 3 disciplines that pacify level 65 mobs. Why do they get 3 that effect level 65 mobs? Is this so they can use all three to pacify a large number of mobs or can you only use one of the three since they are the same type? 

I haven't played a true melee class so know very little, but flmaes are funny so feel free. Just be sure include good info as well preeze.</description></item><item><title>New Abilities / Disciplines</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/716142/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2004 21:23:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:716142</guid><dc:creator>Kakura Warfist</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>Whoa, Have you seen the new Abilities and Disciplines. I hit 51 not long ago and have been estatic about Stonestance and 70% bind wounds - its all but taken downtime away in soloing. But some of the new Gates of Discord abilities / disciplines rock:

Phantom Wind - Lull?? Is this what I think it is? Cool -are Monks now going to have the ability to lull a mob for a short period of time? - Do I understand that right?

Just some of the new attacks: Nerve Spasm, Armor Crush, Thunderkick, Painstrike. It seems we have a new melee universe out there to explore.

Not sure on the name, but there is three monks standing around, just tag one and FD pull him.  The hardest part is getting away the gaurds.  Easily done at level 50.  Hope this helps.

Just turned 45 after being away from EQ for awhile. Not sure where to go. My equipment is mediocre. Any suggestions on places that are good for a monk to go at this level, group or solo doesn't matter. I would like to start getting some decent monk gear drops. I have all expansions except LoY, and LDoN. Any info would be spectacular.</description></item><item><title>Ive started a monk and dont know a lot about them...</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/716120/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2003 00:25:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:716120</guid><dc:creator>Everdude999</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>Can anybody help me?
