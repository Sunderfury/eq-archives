However, I have 250 skill with GM trophies in nearly all of the trades for quite some time.  I've been doing tons and tons of combines for a long time.  I've noticed the failure rate increasing from an average of 50% now to an average of 75-80%.  I've also noticed more fizzles than I have before, more misses, etc.  I am seriously wondering if the dev team is trying to retain their player base by slowing players down, creating money sinks by tweaking the random number generater to create more "failures" across the board.  Sounds pretty stupid, but the hard numbers I've experienced over the last several months do not lie.</description></item><item><title>Upcoming change to tradskilling!!</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1263812/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2003 18:17:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1263812</guid><dc:creator>Wizard of the Shadows</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>Taken from &lt;A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp" TARGET="_BLANK"&gt;http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp&lt;/A&gt;

"Tradeskill Interface Upgrade

Tired of all the clicking and dragging needed just to make a type 1 wood arrow?  We know that the current tradeskill interface is cumbersome, so the UI guys have come up with some new ideas.

Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface.  In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently available to you.  This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as some above it.  Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion.  Clicking the "combine" button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the results on the player's cursor.  The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination."

Whoohoo.....Looks like I am putting off my hardcore tradskilling for a little while. :)

Well the other day a guy shouted out that he was holding a raffle.  The more tickets you bought the better your chances of winning.  Each ticket cost 1k.  Now I know thats an absurd price but this guy was saying all these 20k items you could win and when I asked him to show me them just to make sure he really had them and wasn't just search linking.  Well he really had them!  Anyways several people got interested.  Most of the people that entered the "raffle" bought around 2-3 tickets.  One idiot bought 7 but anyways, he then proceded to the bank after everyone had given him the cash for the raffle without saying who won or even rolling for that matter.  He then proceded to make take all the gear off of his character (I'm guessing he put it in a bag) and went LD.  My guess is he stuck all the plat and gear into the bank and deleted hs character since I never heard of him again and the GM couldn't trace him when I petitioned.  But anyways I'm just warning all of you to be cautious when entering a "raffle"</description></item><item><title>Y R there so many people who play eq and make fun of other eqers?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1263806/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2003 18:54:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1263806</guid><dc:creator>Lusint_Of_Luclin_Server</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>why is there so many People that Make fun of others for playing Eq when they play eq as much as anyone

"Tradeskill trivial failures will be reduced. Obviously even a great master can make mistakes. EverQuest players, however, have expressed that they feel master tradeskillers fail on trivial items too frequently. We have reviewed the trivial failure chances and have made a change to the way they work. The greater the skill of the character relative to the skill needed to complete a recipe; the less likely he is to fail on a trivial recipe." - From

I am kinda worried about if/how this is going to change your chance of success at higher level combines.
I just recently failed the combine for the 5th shawl with a tailoring skill of 122. The combine supposedly trivials at 115. I know that I had less than a 95% chance of success. (I beleive the current system makes a 95% chance of success with a 130 skill on a combine trivial at 115.) I have finished re-collecting the components for the combine and got my tailoring to 127. (I plan to get to 130 at least before attempting.)

I am wondering if I will still have a 95% chance of success if I am at 130. Anyone on a Legends servor happen to know how this going to affect things?

I imagine this little handy-dandy chart to going to change:

I have around 1400pp in the bank and decent equipment. One day I saw a jewelers trade skill trophy. I got interested and looked online, and noticed how f*ing awesome the alchemy trophy is! 15 wis, 10 str,50 cha in an ammo slot! So I checked out the others too and noticed that just for something like baking, I could get a 10 wis, 10 str, 50 cha item along with making tight food.

I figure if I grand master something easy for around 1000pp, I will have an easy time with my next few trade skills at higher lvl because of the 50 cha and 10 wis, plus lvling with 10 wis and 10 str will be great as well. 

Just looking for some feedback. I was thinking about tradeskills in the first place, but economically i figured it was smarter to start them in the 40s... I just need to know which one will be cheapest/easiest to gm first.

Also, remember that I am an iksar! I can NOT go to freeport or those good cities. I can go to cabilis and some places on the moon.

as a shaman, I wanted to do both blacksmithing and alchemy (when i get to level 25, im only 11 now).
so i have two questions:
1. it wont hurt much to do both with the skill cap 200 thing because the formula is "(lvl -24) * 5" (so the max at 65 is 205), right?  or does doing two tradeskills make the second go slower?  i dont think ill ever get to 65, but if i do 5 points isnt a big deal, i just dont want it to go slower.
2. does doing two tradeskills on one character make sense to you?  i definitely want to do alchemy, but im not sure if i should do blacksmithing also.

thanks for listening!
