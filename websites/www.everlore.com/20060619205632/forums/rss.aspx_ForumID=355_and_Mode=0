I came here in search of guild info and meet some other players, but after reading some of the posts I think I'll just pass on that and stay solo until I burn out on the game.  

No offense to those that do post usefull/interesting info but the ratio of those are 1-50 it appears.  

At first I thought maybe it was just that a bunch of immature kids posting on all the server forums. However, after looking at some of the other servers threads (didnt go through every single one) it appears I picked the wrong server to play on.  

There are some seriously pathetic posts on here...and white guys trying to be rapper gangsters is just sad.

And yes I am posting anon, as I have no desire to be part of this community
