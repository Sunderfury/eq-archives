I hit the testEQ thing and then changed the .ini file from DX7 to DX8.  I ran the game and all loading screens and main character menu is all blurry and half working.  Is this it?  Or am I missing something?  I hope its not fully implemented yet, because with performance like this, I won't be playing the game much if this is the final result...

Also, once they switch all servers to DX8, and it doesn't work for some of us, will the DX7 still be an option to even play or is it finished? If this isn't an option, VI is going to lose a ton of players...</description></item><item><title>New Board</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1214906/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2001 00:50:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1214906</guid><dc:creator>Liusadh</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>k, if this is a dead board, let's get this one going:  http://pub46.ezboard.com/bevertest</description></item><item><title>Just bored</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1214905/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2001 03:57:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1214905</guid><dc:creator>Darlakamus Manarthamal "The Nude Gnome"</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>Its 5am and I just got off from soloing in Overthere.

Well she changed the password to the account, and I asked her if I could get the items off of my Bard and transfer them to MY account.. she let me.

 Well I got the items to my account on my new character (Druician The Bard) and was fighting in G Fay when I get booted to desktop (technical issue being looked into) well I thought "Hell, I have to get back on to make sure I survived that train of wasp drones and bats I pulled" (thinking I could take them with Icetooth's Claws, and a Velium Round shield with full Banded) anyways I got back on, and server goes down (Test Server) so I go to chat room to find out ETA and its 1 hour. So I know that my corpse out there in G Fay at level 1 will rot in 30 minutes or so.. Well I talked to a Tech rep about crashing issue, and he told me to download drivers for my Voodoo3 and SB PCI512, I did.. took me an hour and a half total..
 
 So I go back in and I find my corpse gone :( and the point of this post is to wonder if anyone on test server would be kind enough to help me out please? Any Bard Items would be appreciated.. - Thanks in Advance, Ill pay you back anyway I know how later on.

Or do i have to create a whole new character on the Test server- and do you experience alot of changes on the test server?
