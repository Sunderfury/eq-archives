They have no magic but are able to wield many weapons all through Norrath. Being able to wear very powerful armor makes it very tuff to be killed. Donâ€™t forget that the ladies get really impressed when they see a Warrior fully decked out in shiny armor. Groups always welcome a warrior to take the blunt of attacks while the casters use powerful spells.</description><dc:language>en-US</dc:language><generator>CommunityServer 1.1 (Build: 1.1.0.50615)</generator><item><title>47 lvl warrior</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/883639/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2005 00:55:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:883639</guid><dc:creator>darkmangler</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>    Hi all i have read all the posts i myself have 47 lvl warrior 2865 hp 842 ac 941 str and i can solo frost giants 1 at a time and way to heal time i like to group but it is cool to solo as well.I have only been playing for 3 months but i love the game and i warrior is my fav character but i would like to be able to kill for a longer period of time when i started the game i was killing yellows and whites now im lucky to get one blue under my belt.Like i said i like grouping but sometimes pain in the ass or the people you are with are jerks so it is cool to solo.

Let me ask something, a Paladin is half Warrior, half Cleric right?  Can a 55 Paladin out-heal a 55 Cleric? Can that Paladin out-buff that Cleric?  Shadow Knights are half Warrior, Half Necromeancer, can they do more DoT damage than a Necromeancer of the same level?  Can the SKs pet outdo the Necros pet?  So how can a Paladin/SK of equal level and gear out-tank a Warrior?  Unless the Warrior completely sucked, it isn't happen.  Just wanted to get these thoughts out there.  Seems that few think of it.  And remember, aggro is a group effort.  </description></item><item><title>omg im so lost in this crazy warrior, damn you verant</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/883632/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2004 06:49:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:883632</guid><dc:creator>Noneofyabizness</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>First of all i would like to say, "damn you verant" , okay, heres my problem gents, i made an ogre war , he has 400 ac and 900 hp at level 13 =), although... he looks like a dumbass bufoon, and i figured he wouldnt look as lame as he does, but i couldnt believe it once i equipped him, he looks like crap with both kinds of models, im thinking of just restarting him as a half elf, cuz they are sleek ass pimps, what do yall think?

I started a warrior not long ago - didn't do a lot of research, just went ahead and did it... so far I love him - it's fantastic being up front and being able to take the hits. It's also great being able to take agro from another player 4 levels higher than me (melee character - either SK or Beserker from memory). However I find I now have two questions in particular.

1. When I created him, I went to Casters Realm and followed their creation guide. So far I have not regretted this, however I read on one of the threads in here that my diety should be RZ and guess what... I'm agnostic. I really don't want to start him again as I have now got a group of people around my level that I enjoy grouping with but the post was talking about different kinds of armour I won't be able to wear without the right diety. I guess my question is - Am I going to regret hugely down the track that I do not have a diety?

2. I haven't worked on Peircing yet - keep planning on doing that however my question is not 'What wep should I use?' (I hate those posts) but more - what combintation of Damage vs Delay should I be using in which situation? I know low delay is good but high damage is great as well...

For my two one handed weps I am currently using a 1hb and 1hs - should I be concentrating more damage or delay and around what of each... ie should I be looking for low 20's delay and trade a bit of damage (at the moment with my price range I can afford I would be lucky to hit 10 damage for that delay).

For 2hs and 2hb should these be high damage or low delay...

I'm not neccasarily wanting a whole bunch of 'You should use the such and such' more of a indication of what I should be aiming for with each style... should I be going for damage output with 2 wep's and if so should I be more concerned with damage or delay...

For the record my wepons are currently:

1hs: Bladecatcher of the Marshall - Delay 24 - Damage 12
1hb: Centi Warhammer - Delay 32 - Damage 15 (bought in bazaar for 25pp... go figure)
2hb: Steel Rod of the Knight - Delay 44 - Damage 35
2hs: Fabled Gigantic Zweihander - Delay 39 - Damage 25 (was in EF and somenoe shouted out it was rotting)

As you can see I have taken advantage of the 5th aniversery. I have a Bloodguard Wand of the Walking dead as well but as it has a recommended level the stats are a little worse than my Centi Warhammer at the moment.

I appreciate any help that people can give me.</description></item><item><title>Raising weapon skills</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/883604/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2004 17:38:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:883604</guid><dc:creator>Rhuast</dc:creator><slash:comments>18</slash:comments><description>I apologise if this has been asked before. My main is a Shammy - yup he's cool and I like him heaps. I created a SK to specifically play with one person and got addicted to the amount of damage they could do when in front of a mob compared to my shammy who does most of his damage with spells/pets etc. So I decided to make another melee character to play when my SK was unable to play with my other character. As I mentioned, doing some damage was my main aim so I decided to go for an Ogre for the Strength/Stamina thing... also I had grouped with a couple of real characters who roleplayed their Warriors fantastically and I liked that idead.

So my L12 Warrior is running around with massive strength and not alot of intelligence (he get's distracted by shiny things very frequently)... my question is, should my weapon skills be raising very slowly? I'm only soloing atm until I get to L15 when I plan on getting him to go into LDoN adv. I'm using 2hb mostly at the moment as I got one of the steel rods from the 5th Anviersery - the 40 dmg life proc is great for a class that can't heal themselves except through bind wounds. His Weapon skills in 2hb is currently sitting at 32 (I think, low 30's anyway) and I just seem to remember my SK raising those skills alot quicker. I expected a little bit slower raising of these skills and I imagine this is normal but it seems to be such a slog to raise just one point... is there anything I can do to help this? Should be going back to pok to get a mind buff before heading back into the wilderness?

Thanks in advance.</description></item><item><title>Dual Wield Question...</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/883600/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2004 23:12:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:883600</guid><dc:creator>Kebast</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>I have two weapons with the same ratio, which should I use in the primary?  One is a 13/21 the other is 16/26.  Also, if a weapon has a damage bonus (ie cold, fire..etc) is that damage always applied or does it get resisted?  Also, does that modifier have a level requirement to work if the weapon has a recommended level?
