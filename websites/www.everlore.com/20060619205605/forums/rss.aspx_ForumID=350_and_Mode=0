I'll grant you that the server doesn't seem so much like a ghost town anymore.  

Anyway, given the diverse population located in and around the nexus, I decided to PK.  One guy was afk and I killed him.  He claimed he was going to report me.  SINCE WHEN DOES AFK FLAG MAKE YOU FREE FROM ATTACKS?  Can I go in the middle of toxx forrest as an Ogre and go afk and yell that I was unfairly assaulted?  No.

I killed this individual to make a point.  This is  a PvP server and people need to start treating it that way.  If you go afk out in the open, you're just begging to be attacked.

Just for the record, after I deposited his money in the bank, I fought him 7 more times and killed him every time.  So, no, I did not need to attack him only becuase he was afk.

Sorry so long a post for such a quick point.

Apparently they save your characters more than 3 months because I reactivated my account and all my characters were still there.  

The point of this thread, however, is that Tallon Zek is now a ghost town.  I was a hard core Human Retribution member and used to kill anything not human.  Now, I can't even find humans.  What happened to Tallon Zek?  Are all the servers like this?  Have they thought of combining any of them?  EQ is a dying world and it's depressing to see how few people actually play.  A human mage should not be able to run freely in S ro for hours and hours and not find a single person to fight.

My AOL name is earthenfist if you ever want to chat about old server politics or something. I never knew any of you that well in game but we always backed up the "cause" together and I've never read a post by either of you that didn't have me knodding in agreement or LMAO.

Only in the last few levels have I been grouping much, from HPH to PC back to HHK.

Anyway, my take on xteaming is I don't care for it. Not in the hardcore Human-Elf-Short-Dark division sense, though. From an RP standpoint, I see no problem with a Human following a 'good' deity (Rodcet, Erollisi, etc) buddying around with elves, or dwarf paladins, or a Human ranger or druid hanging with Halflings. It makes RP sense. Basically, I think random xteaming = bad, RP xteaming = OK.

But, even though I just joined a 3-team guild (all light teams, because you're just raw meat w/o a guild tag), my dream in EQ is an evil human team guild - rogues, Necros, SKs, and any other Hum/Erud/Barb classes following one of the 'evil' deities (Innoruuk, Bertox, Cazic). Wouldn't a group like that make sense to deal with some of the dark races? That's the problem I would have with hardcoding. It seems a lot of the complaint about xteaming mentions roleplaying, but wouldn't hardcoding also hurt roleplaying? Since there just aren't a whole lot of us evil humans running around, maybe that perspective hasn't really been looked at yet.

Anyway, the best solution would just be for people to take the RP aspect a little more seriously, although I don't know how you could get everyone to do that. But it would solve a lot of the problems, from rampant xteaming to twinking (my personal peeve, 20ish WE rangers with Wurmslayers CCing you at lvl 14 ain't fun).

Maybe if there were some sort of PC-PC faction, based on a race/class/deity formula, or simply tied to whatever NPC guild you belong to. Like you couldn't group with or help or trade with any PC whose faction was dubious or worse. Make it apprehensive if you want to really crack down.

Because if hardcoding were to happen, how could I ever assemble a huge ogre army to burn Kelethin to the ground?</description></item><item><title>Beastlord and PvP :)</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1213747/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2003 10:41:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1213747</guid><dc:creator>Fiavy</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>Who would you fight against a Beastlord ? The warder or the beastlord ?
How much damage a beastlord pet do at lev 15 ?
Well read on, never had so much fun in PvP than with my beastlord so far :)

After lev 15, the proc of the pet is just awesome  basically PvP is simple, whether you do melee / Heal pet if the opponent is an intelligent one who understood the pet was the real threat at my level, whether you heal yourself and run letting the pet kill your opponent when he'ss notice the "blue" pet is casting DD for over 65 in dmg 

After I killed at lev 16 a lev 15 Ogre sk (really easy sk's for a beastlord  ), I had a DE caster coming in invis mode around me while I was medding  Well he said things like "hummm, yummy !" while inspecting me. Then he appeared and attacked ...
He was over lev 20 (had his surname) necro , was a 16 untwinked vah shir beastlord. Basically was so sure of himself he did not summon his skel pet  So he dotted me, dqrkness etc ... while the pet was attacking him. After a few proc ( DD) fro, the pet, the necro was already starting lifespike on me as he was around &amp; bubble of life when I was still at about 50%. Qt that time, I offered to stop the fight and made my pet back off (could have won interrupting his spells but also palying darks and did not want to get him looking stupid with his friends around when he came first to show off  ).
But well, as soon as I ordered my pet to back off, he did cast again some lifespike on me to get some life back and then did choose to go on with attaking me :/
After these two more lifespike from a lev 20 necro, my life was running quite low and finally deciding to run towards the nearest zone (Necro's haven't DD  ). 

All the time, the necro's NEVER did pay any attention to my pet who did basically 80% of the dammage and DD. While I was running away, the necro ran after me a little while but then had to stop as his life was running low again (pet). He then did choose to get rid of the pet and to let me escape BUT .... the pet (green at lev 20 ) wqs still full life when he wasn't and a few DD proc later , had the message "Tiote's warder killed the necro" and was fun to come back ans say hi to the the darks who called their lev 20 plus friend to get rid of me  No one attacked hehe 

So Beastlord sucks in PvP, do not think so, it's just easy, the pet do not suck in PvP as most other pet class, we can easily heal the pet, we are 70% of a monk who can buff, and we can reduce downtime healing.

PvP was really nice without twinking, now I spent about 35k pp in gear for Fiavy, gave 35k to my friend Flavy and we are going to test these new lev 1 char (Beast / Drood ) around Qeynos tonight .

Beastlord rocks !
