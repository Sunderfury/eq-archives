Ive been on XEV ever since ive started back in 99' and have seen friends come and go.

I was grouped with a toon name Kinyena on a LDoN adventure.  We didn't win was a rescue mission and time ran out on the way out.

After the mission in which Kinyena was main looter and leader.  We get one person who can't find the way out of Guk.  I stop to go back in after him, and ask about the loot where she was going to sell.  She claims she is in S. Ro. and if we want a split we better hurry she is logging.  I tell her I'm going to get can't rember his name right now, and that we would be on our way.  He has wondered away from dungeon entrance and is lost she claims last call on split and logs.  All of this in a time frame of no more than 2-3 minutes.

Not sure what to do other than post on boards so it don't happen to anyone else, or maybe ooc if I see her in zone.  </description></item><item><title>Mercenary Guild</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1663625/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2003 18:57:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1663625</guid><dc:creator>Ardos</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>I had an idea to make a guild for the purpose of renting out our services to other players, guilds, groups etc.  After developing a good amount of members the guild would go on frequent raids to learn ways around and then advertise our services.  I have a feeling it would be very lucrative and a lot of fun.  Still in the planning phase but send me an email if interested.

If you are a member of a smaller RP guild on Xev, around 30 active members or so as that is about equal to my guild, and you think your guild would be interested in such an idea please email me at Partybane2000@yahoo.com or reply here. We are primarily a good guild and so would prefer an evil guild as rival, but any RP guild would do really, if not evil we will just have to come up with some RP about why our guilds are not on the best of terms. Becoming a rival/enemy would pretty much involve guild competition, taunting members of the opposite guild when you saw them, guild wars every now and then, and other such RP fun.

Thanks for your time and reading this, if you have any questions about anything I didn't really address please email me or reply, I would like a response ASAP.</description></item></channel></rss>
