Please help me find a CHEAP way to get from about 110-170+ and I would be grateful. I am on Drinal server if you want to talk to me in-game and my E-mail is in this post. Thanks!

If there is any one on Drinal server reading this and have seen the stats on these MOFO's and want one im 50 skill points from making these.  I need to be funded and provided with the parts for the bow's that you would like made.  If parts are provided you get at a reduced cost.  If funds are provided for A) to get to 250 in fletching, B)to buy parts for the uber bow, You will get a greatly reduced cost.

An officer in my guild offered to make it for me if I gathered all of the stuff, so I said I'd look it up and get it all ready for him. 

I went to a bunch of sites, and this is the best I have been able to come up with:

*Rienforced Planar Beam (branch of planar oak, mithril working knife, mithril alloy rod)

*Light Mithril string

* 2 standard bow cams

* mythril working knife
____________________________________________________

The only thing I have, in my possession, right now is te branch of planar oak..which I foraged to my surprise in PoG. I have NO idea where the other stuff comes from, or even if the recipe is right. 

What concerns me is that he asked me to get someone to make some enchanted clay or something, and to buy a blue diamond. Hehe, Blue Diamonds cost 600P on my server, so I hope it really is needed. 

How do I get these other things? Will he make them with his fletching skill? (I should say that he also has some other above 100 skills)

He told me he'd make this awesome bow a long time ago, and I know he will, I just have to get him the stuff. But, I don't know exactly what stuff he needs now hehe, I would appreciate any help in this matter a LOT!! My ranger could really use this bow, hehe.

Especially because I'm too poor to have afforded a second attempt...lol.

Ok, so it was only a Hickory with a Hemp String...the easiest bow to make.  But, it allowed me to sell the Hunting bow I had been carrying.
