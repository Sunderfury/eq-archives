I had quit EverQuest several years ago and hadn't planned on playing ever again.  Well you all know how that goes..

Anyway, I have been trying to reinstall EQ again.  Unfortunately, I get an eqgame.exe error whenever the game tries to open.  After I open the patcher, and click Play, a little black box at the top left of the screen sits there and then disappears.  This is when the error message pops up. :(

So can anyone help me figure this little dilemma out?

By the way, I'm running DirectX 9.0c and I have the 66.71 nVIDIA drivers.  So everything is fully up to date.  I've noticed on the EverQuest.com forums that EQ only runs on DirectX 9.0b..  Well I tried to download it and install, but whenever I did this it said that my DirectX was already up to date and required no update.  Poo.

HELP :(


P.S. Nice to talk to you guys again :)</description></item><item><title>great..but....</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1160705/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2004 00:56:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1160705</guid><dc:creator>Aela-no password</dc:creator><slash:comments>6</slash:comments><description>I don't have my login :p</description></item><item><title>Topic Moved: Hey Vaal......</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1160704/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2004 00:21:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1160704</guid><dc:creator>Vaal</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>This topic was moved to: EverQuest - General - Staff Lounge&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.everlore.com\MB_Show.asp?SURL=http://www.everlore.com&amp;CAT=General&amp;FID=130&amp;FN=Staff Lounge&amp;SID=7&amp;SN=EverQuest&amp;TID=2172232&amp;PL=3"&gt;Please click here to view this thread.&lt;/a&gt;</description></item><item><title>Anyone remember...?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1160703/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2004 05:06:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1160703</guid><dc:creator>Krowa</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>Fayt McRogie? I used to play ages ago, also played Opalstorm the mage.  I have been away for a very long time, wondering if anyone can remember?  I have since lost my account and all my stuff, but wondering if anyone who remembers me still plays?

I am playing the free trial on Mordern Rasp (SP?) but I dont know if its worth playing on that server.  How is Brell these days, I was hoping I could get started somewhere on any server and get to high end stuff as soon as I could.  Just trying to get the best chance.

Anyway, to all those who rememebr me, just wanna say hi, never really talked to anyone after I left which is sad.  Its been a long time and I have gotten the urge to come back ;).</description></item><item><title>This may be a stupid question</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1160700/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2004 09:50:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1160700</guid><dc:creator>ThePain</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>But where is the bazaar located?

The reasoning by this is very simple.  I first started this character a couple years ago and decided to quit playing.  I gave my character to my older brother, who enjoyed playing this character.  He would play this character quite often and had many friends on-line.

Tragically, my older brother was killed in an automobile accident while returning home from work. He was killed while crossing a train intersection and the train struck his car with my little brother also in the car.  My older brother, Tony, later died at the hospital due to injuries he suffered from the accident.  My little brother is expected to make a full recovery.

I'm sure some people will remember him as I do.  Always willing to help when people needed it.  I felt compelled to let his on-line friends know, because he loved to play on-line with these friends.  Thanks for you time.

I quit playing right after LoY came out--bought and installed it and didn't play again.  I knew about the bigger bank, but when did the shared bank slots appear? So self-twinking is officially sanctioned...

Anyway, I was on an adventure tuesday, and didn't know how to link an item so others could see stats.  How do you do it? I asked my group, and much to my shame, someone said "Is this your first char, hun?"

Well, yeah it is, but I have 40 days play time over the last FOUR YEARS...Anyway, please spell it out for me how to do this, and I should be up to speed on everything else.  Thanks!</description></item><item><title>A new guild, maybe?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1160646/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2004 21:55:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1160646</guid><dc:creator>The New Rainbow Flip</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>/em crawls out of a big hole...dusts himself off...finds out he's been gone so long they decided to reset his total documents count to zero.

*ahem*

Okay, I'll admit, a long time ago I gave up on EverQuest entirely.  I basically dropped it in a pit, ran far, far away, and didn't look back for a couple years or so.
But that aside now...I'm back, after spending a whole buncha money on the new expansions and such, and I've worked my way back up to level 20 (Vah Shir Rogue;A completely new direction for me).
Anyway, my question is this, and I hope there is a good answer; Does anyone know of an active guild on Brell which would accept my new lowbie, and more specifically, does anyone know of such a guild that is specifically focused on participating in LDoN adventures?
AND, if there is no such guild, might I ask if anyone here might like the idea of starting a guild which is specifically focused on participating and gathering information on LDoN adventures?

Where did everyone move to, or have they all left game by this time..

ANyway i have come to bring new of the greatest movie that has ever come out. It goes by the name of " The Lord Of The Rings Return of The King. This is perhaps one of the greatest movies that i have seen in my life time. This is the only series that i can honestly say that that each movie is at least 10 times better then the one that precided it. EVERYONE MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!</description></item></channel></rss>
