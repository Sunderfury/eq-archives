Or am I too low level at 27?  I've heard of the spells that deal with traps and am interested in them, if only for the sake of completing the spell book.

My lvl 3 bard has a song that raises stamina, how is that helping my character? When i look at my inventory it doesn't show any stats as being up. So i guess the question is what is th ebonus of having your stamina up?

Until recently I'd never tried charming before, but I've had lots of fun the last few days sending griffons in to fight poachers in Jaggedpine.  The only problem is my charms have a habit of breaking after a minute or two.  Is it worth it to drop 30 wis to add 60 or 80 char?  (my base wis is about 210 and my char is 43 - eye of griffon...:-))

I'm ok for now using griffons, but I'm worried I'll be in trouble in ME when I try charming there...

Thanks!
