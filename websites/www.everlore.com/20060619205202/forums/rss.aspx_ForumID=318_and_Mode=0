Also, saw where you can redo parts over and over to get faction up and skip to the tear - Two part question on this info: first, do you still need the tear or can you just kill Rak and get the scale? Second, do you have to be ally faction with the Sentinel in Emerald Jungle to get spear (I'm ally with wandering spirit but indiff to sentinel now)?</description></item><item><title>Bloody Hell This took ages to read</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/847782/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2004 18:55:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:847782</guid><dc:creator>Xinbic</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>Ive Just started playing everquest been interested for a while and have been researching into it. Ive got a lvl 11 Barb Shaman and its cool Im grouping with my flatmate whos played for a while hes playing with a Barb warrior. Its tough not being a long time player as almost everyone has better stuff from higher lvl chars but I was wondering is their any point in trying to increase the Blacksmith skill if everyones running around in twinked armor I cant see people rushing up to buy banded if the stuff theve got is better.
This thread rocks bye the way.

I am hunting in Paludal caverns (bandits). When I hit 20 (Or would 24 be better? Tell me because I am not sure.) I plan on doing LDoN. 

 My gear consists of my "Spirit Charmer's" newbie quest.(Except for the chest, because it was too much of a bitch to get). My chest slot is a Lockjaw hide vest. The rest is fungal fiend/bronze brigadine armor. I got a couple of those Bandit rings, also. 

My weapon is "Staff of the Spirit Charmer". 11/36 +5hp 1 wis 3 undead bane damage.


 Any suggestions on equipment? I am poor. Just making what I can offa bandits.</description></item><item><title>An Expensive Lesson</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/847721/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2004 00:12:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:847721</guid><dc:creator>Valendaryl</dc:creator><slash:comments>26</slash:comments><description>People all the time are posting on here about stupid things they've done...  So I thought "What the hell, I might as well..."

Last night, after two runs in MM LDoN, I dinged 39 and finally had enough points to buy my Pack Shrew spell.  Since I was ML, I waited for everyone to zone in for the split, then I was off to PoK to work on some trade skills.

This is where I learned a VERY expensive lesson about SKILL CAPS.  I spent a good hour working on my alchemy, which hit 75 in the first few minutes.  At the end of the hour, and after spending 2kpp, I realized I hadn't had a skill-up in QUITE a while.

So...  I hit the Shaman guides.  Lo and behold there is a VERY ugly skill cap on alchemy (level - 25) * 5.  I was so pissed at myself, but I have 8 or so 10 dose potions to sell.

Tried a couple gate potions as well just to see if I could get lucky.  Guess I'll wait 20 levels or so before I try that again.

Laugh at me, laugh with me...

Just laugh.

Have a great day.</description></item><item><title>Shaman Custom UI's</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/847717/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2004 20:50:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:847717</guid><dc:creator>Valendaryl</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>I have spent days searching through the UI's at EQ Interface and I am really at a loss.

I currently soley play a shaman (level 58) and im looking to buy a second account and powerlevel up a character to duo with the shaman. What would you say is the "best" full time duo partner. Shaman alone is a powerfull soloist so what aids to this class. The only thoughts i had were: 
   bard- utility spells(songs), can HoT mana regen etc etc and also adds dots and such which now stack so we could just set it up so that my pet is tanking and we dot n' rot. Enchanter- simply for mindbuffs and cc shaman would get single pulls each time. Monk- high dps, alright tank with shaman heals, fd for pulling. 
   Any opinions? ty. </description></item><item><title>Shaman 61 pet</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/847700/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2004 19:24:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:847700</guid><dc:creator>No body</dc:creator><slash:comments>6</slash:comments><description>True spirit, the shaman last pet spell what kind of hp and dmg are we talking about here? any procs anything special...a website with the info would greatly help also...Thanks to all who help</description></item><item><title>Upgrade From Totemic</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/847696/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2004 02:09:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:847696</guid><dc:creator>Kileddar Frostbear</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>Greetings everyone.  This is a simple, and possibly dumb question.  I am still a newbie 35 Shaman looking for some advice.  I have a full suit of Totemic armor.  unfortunitly, the armor is no longer supporting me in my adventures.  I generaly play in a group as the Buffer, Healer, and nuker.  However, I do like to work on my own and mix it up in the fray.  I am looking for ideas for full suits of armor to get my hands on.  I say full suits cause I like to not have my charater armors clash in styles.  I am lookig for items to buy, or even quests to do.  can anyone give me some help.

Sincerely
Your Fellow Shaman in arms
