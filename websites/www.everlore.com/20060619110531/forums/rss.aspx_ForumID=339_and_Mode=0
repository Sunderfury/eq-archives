I am an officer in an all-gnome guild on Lanys.  We have several members that are in their 50s, but we could use some more.  Most of our members are INT casters, which makes it tough to group together in the planes.  We do have an up-and-coming cleric (49) though.

But we could use some more tanks.  Warriors, Shadow Knights, and Paladins would be nice, though any class is welcome to join.  And of course more clerics wouldn't hurt either.

I'm a GM Jeweler w/trophy and 240+ tinker and a Geerlok (trophy soon).  Once I get my smithing up higher I'll be able to provide our cultural armor.  We also have another GM JC and one GM in Baking.

One more level and I'll be able to cast KEI (already have the scroll).

We are allies with a couple other guilds on Lanys, and we are part of the United Alliance.  But I would love to be more self-supporting.  And for that, we need tanks.

We are kind of a family guild, and a fun group of people.  If you'd like to learn more about us and possibly join our ranks, please post a message here and we will work something out.


Thank you for your time,
-- C.

Ones that might take a 47 Enchanter?

I am currently in an all-gnome guild, which is a lot of fun, but there aren't very many people in the 50s yet.  Several have started getting in to the 40s though, but only allowing gnomes limits what classes we have.  We are allied with Circle of Knowledge, and group with them, so that helps fill out the missing classes.

I've heard of these and they seem to be fairly high level:

Semper Simul
Sigil
Iris (Isis?)

Are these well-respected guilds?  Are there others on Lanys you'd recommend?



Thanks,

Correct me if I am wrong but before all these new changes were made, say about 5 or 6 months ago, there were halflings at the halfling temple.  He says there was never anything there.  I know different because my 12 DE Necro was killed by the things.  If you are fuzzy about where I am talking about it is as you are leaving Nektulos towards EC just past the bridge and then take an immediate right.  The temple was there along the coastline.  I am not sure if it is there now because I haven't been that way in a while.  I know that the halflings that are by the newbie log are new. To me they are anyway because I haven't played for about 4 months or so.  Please god someone answer this so I can be at peace!!</description></item><item><title>guild chosen</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1176271/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2002 02:25:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1176271</guid><dc:creator>unhappy dwarf</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>well its about time somone said somthing and being that i vet , guess it should be. Guild chosen , since i came back to everquest from long break , i notice this guild named chosen .  rude , mouthy ,just plain out assholes , why well lets name few reasons. First they have 60s camping 40 spawns all the time , and i mean all the time i came on night  at 2am , to see the same person on the same spawn for more 12hours. Can you say get life , i new you could,  group of 40s plus want to camp this thease spawn , does he pass down , oh no cant do that why , because half guild is greedy . they dont respect others at all . they think just because there 60 no one els has the right to camp anything . Just got wait in line with 12 other groups waitting for the same spawn been line for god knows how long . I i think guild personla needs to do raides, there alot 60s guilds out there that doing raides for there 60s NOT there toons .TOOns dont mean sqaut when comes to player with mains trying to get exp . think verrant should make a new rules if your 50 plus you cant camp a 40 plus spawn and so on that would help other people trying to lvl . get some exp they need . 99% of the time people arent after the loot the spawn dropps they want the exp.  chosen as guild i would put them on the top of list for just plain assholes list.If anyone wants to say this guild bashing go ahead but when somones 60 and doesnt pass a simple spawn off to lower group out respect for lower lvls they need to be bashed on maybe it will kick some since into them. signed unhappy dwarf..

I'm spending my last night in what turned out to be a 14 week prison/rehab facility and is yet again able to turn on my computer and play the game again. I still have a long trip ahead of me, but when I think of what's ahead, i'll endure. Thing is, I do not know what avatar i will be playing when I get back. When I left, I was a lvl 36 WIZ with the No Drop items suitable for that lvl (sotf, liz cloak, staff of the wheel) However, I transfered my other equip to a friends mule, just to save that bit, in case VI decided that "He's not playing, so we can delete him".
Anyway, When I get back i'll find out. Say hello when you see me, Either as EprinZ Pageflipper, the lvl36 WIZ - or Shub, the lvl 1 twinked (with the old gear) wiz, I'm rusty, but still able to work...

In the meantime, Take care and happy grinding. Oh, btw, anyone know if the guild "Birthright" is still out there?
