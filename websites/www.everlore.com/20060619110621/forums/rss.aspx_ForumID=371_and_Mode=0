You should be able to sell them to others too so gnomes wouldnt be "all powerfull" just gnomes would be the only ones who can make them. I think they should give bonuses to speed (faster than running but slower than SOW), and bonuses to stats too. Well just look at my example.


Item:Iron mage legs small
slot:legs and feet
stat bonuses:+5 agility +10 int. +50 mana +5 AC
Items needed to make: 6 pieces of sheet metal, 4 gears, 1 gem (some sort of rare gem), 1 clockwork mage legs blueprint.
Class:necromancer, magician, wizard, druid, cleric.
Race:small races such as gnome
Description: makes it look like you have 4 robotic legs, good for casters. Contains 12 inventory slots and it holds a certain amount of weight (without encumbering you).

Clockwork "pets" would really be just items to give you bonuses/carry more and make you look cool.They would have to be expensive to make though.

If you are a GM PLEASE consider this, if you are a player please post your ideas, and maybe clockworks will be made in a patch someday.</description></item><item><title>Where did they go......</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1281225/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2002 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1281225</guid><dc:creator>Puma</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>First I'd like to say I am a strong soporter for better tinkering. Now to get to business. Ok a guild on the Tallon zek server (my guild) has a good cause and needs all the gnomes we can get. We are few in numbers very few ur lucky to see one of us once a month. We are a guild called Bring back the pumas. We have contacted sony but they ingnore us. Soon our time will come. If our demands our not met we will begin the spamming of anti EQ pro PUMA slogans in every EQ related forum i can gain access to. We will kill every moutain lion apon spawn. This is no joke so if you miss the pumas from SF join our ranks.

I'm a level 32 gnome on the Cazic-Thule server who just blew over 300 plat to make 9 'standard bow cams'....... does this seem a little bit expensive to anyone else but me????

Why do they rook us gnomes with the most expensive (well.... shammy's alchamy is plat intensive too) trade skill that takes upwards of 1k plat to even get over a skill of 75??? Are there any ways i can save some plat when trying to tinker? what is cheap to make and easy to sell or at least give away? please help out a gnome in need!

I am learning as I go.  The web is where I got my Compendiums.

My skill is, as of yesterday, 70.  I made a lot of bow cams to get there. (That is trivial at 75.)  I have spent in the neighborhood of 1k on my supplies &amp; components. 

I found it easiset to nail my L23 gnome wizzy's tail to the floor of the windmill in Steamfront with a lot of pp in my pocket.  I purchased supplies as I made the cams.  I sold them back after success.  It cost over 15pp to make a bow cam that sells there to merchant for just over 9pp.  I did gain skill though which was my goal.

All the supplies you need for everything are NOT there.

After this patch message I thought.. "Hmm.. I never knew they were broken."

About an hour later I got a request for one. I went to the bank to retrieve an Aqualung that I KNOW had 49 charges on it Before installing SOL. I was going to sell it to a friend and when I put it in the trade window it said on MY side that it had 49 charges. On HIS side it said it had ONE charge. So he cancelled trade and we tried again. This time it said on BOTH our sides that it had ONE CHARGE.

I petitioned a GM about it. Not TOO long afterwards a GM came on and exchanged my aqualung, but when she put it in the trade window it said it had ZERO charges on  it. We tried it again to the same result.  Apparently GMs know that aqualungs are STILL bugged, but SOE does NOT.  I am REALLY starting to lose business over this. There are about 15 individuals and one ENTIRE guild that are upset because I can not tinker their aqualungs for their Kedge Raids like I said I could do before I discovered this problem.

HELP US, SOE !!!!!!!! I'm starting to get "Forget about it,.. I camped hadden" messages !!!!!  :b  Not to mention, there are a LOT of people waiting VERY impatiently I might add, to get into Kedge Keep. :\
