&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.eqjourneys.com/coa/eu_exit/1-desk.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Tap...tap...CRACK

With a sigh, Eurcynia tossed the broken quill into a pile of a dozen other broken quills and replaced it with another fresh harpy plume.

&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;i&gt;M'lady Boojuum,
It pains me to scribe these words, but I must ask for your company in North Ro during the next full moon.  It...it is my calling, and it is yours as well...Just as it was predicted the last time we spoke on the shores of North Ro.
I will be there, no need to respond.
&lt;div align=right&gt;Eurcynia Blitz&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

"That wasn't so bad.." Eurcynia muttered in a low voice.  She folded the letter and sealed it with her family seal, an eloquent B decorated with dancing bolts of light.  She dropped the letter to the ground as she grabbed her hands.  They were trembling and she could not regain control.  She closed her eyes and tried to meditate, clearing her mind of the trials to come.

...

Eurcynia buried her hands in the sand, watching the stars dance before her in the dark blue evening sky.  The ocean waves tickled her feet and the faint singing of the barbarian fishermen echoed in the air.  Her hand wrapped around her dagger, carved from walrus tooth, as she sensed something approaching her.

&lt;img src="http://www.eqjourneys.com/coa/eu_exit/2-boojuum.jpg" align=left&gt;"It's only me, Eurcynia." It was a female voice, and she spoke in gnomish.

Eurcynia's grip did not loosen, "Boojuum...at one time I would have charred your body to a crisp had we crossed paths, but now I beg for your help...how times do change?"

"Do you think your little rat's tooth will out melee my weapons?" laughed Boojuum.

Eurcynia moved her hands behind her head in the sand, "I'm sorry for calling you over here all the way from Velious.  I know you have your own business to deal with.  The last time we met we called a truce and shared honey mead with those very barbarians.  We discussed some important issues, and I'm afraid those issues that seemed like the distant future, have now become the present."

Boojuum nodded.  A young warrior gnome that's appearance slightly resembled the wizard, but with a much more muscular build, you could tell by her eyes she was on the side of good.  

"I...I just don't know how you plan to actually do it." Eurcynia said, puzzled.  "The Conclave was formed to unite the gnomes and form a family...a family that would not be discouraged by the elves and humans in Norrath that constantly overlooked us...and downplayed our significance in the order of things."

"-- Yes, and though actions can speak louder than words, instigating violence is not always going to deliver your message clearly." Boojuum interupted.

"Well this is where you and I differ, with all due respect, I will probably never agree with you,"  Eurcynia smirked, "But it is the will of the ancestors, that you lead the gnomes in this new direction.  I am but a pawn in this game, now I must continue my own journey."

Boojuum nodded, "This.. journey, what is it?"

Eurcynia continued, "Not all the gnomes are going to agree with the change, but it is for the better.  Norrath is a different world.  Just let the brothers and sisters that do stay.. well even those that leave.. know that I will miss them dearly."  Her hands began to tremble again, she stood up, brushing the sand off her red robe.  "I need to return to Ak'Anon."

Boojuum picked up a seashell and tossed it in the ocean, "I know you are on the side of evil, but you have a warm heart sister.  Why don't you repent to the gods and start anew?"

Eurcynia stared at the ocean, a smile creeped over her face, "I serve a purpose, alot of us do."  

Shadows began to dance around Eurcynia as a gate opened next to her.  She reached in her pack and handed Boojuum a ring with the Conclave of Ak'Anon seal.  "The guild is yours.  Take care of the gnomes...it's our future, you know.."

Boojuum stood alone on the beach as Eurcynia faded away.  Somewhere across the ocean Eurcynia must battle her fate.  Boojuum closed her eyes and wished Eurcynia luck.  She placed the ring in her pack, and headed back to the dock to return to Velious.

...

Eurcynia neatly dusted off her desk.  She placed her family seal in a safe behind her bookcase.  She slipped out of her red robe and changed into her soft blue Crystalline Robe.  Her latest prize off of a Dark Elf wizard that attacked her in Greater Faydark.  A smile crossed her face, but slowly faded as her breath became heavy.  "I haven't taken a life in so long, and the last time I did...it was self-defense.  What have I become?"  She pulled her hair up into a bun, and climbed down the ladder.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.eqjourneys.com/coa/eu_exit/3-guild.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
She made her way up the steep path to the Library Mechanamagica.  It was here that she spent most of her childhood, buried in books and practicing her magic.  She paused to acknowledge the building's majesty.  Her ears perked as she could hear the different spells being cast inside.  She gripped her spellbook and headed inside.  Her heart was racing.

"Ahhh!  Good to see you back, Eurcynia!" familiar faces echoed as she made her way to the wizard's room.  She gave hugs and rubbed noses with old friends and teachers.  

She made her way to her old master, bowing before him.  He bowed and asked her to stand up, "This is it?" he asked.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.eqjourneys.com/coa/eu_exit/4-book.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Eurcynia handed him her spell book, "This is it."

He led her through an invisble entrance in the wall, they climbed a ladder to the second floor of the library.  In the room were several beds, most of which were occupied.  Everyone looked so peaceful, as though they had just fallen asleep.  She knew her sister Chromatica was among them, but could not bring herself to find her.  They stopped at a bed towards the back of the room, on the headboard was Eurcynia's family seal.  Sparks of lightning danced around the B.  She realized she had been staring at the seal for a good five minutes, her master was gone, and she stood alone.  She closed her eyes and cast her shieldskin.  She opened her eyes and noticed a faint green hue inside the barrier.  Her hands no longer trembled.

She laid herself down on the bed, and stared at the ceiling.  Her eyes felt heavy as the green mist thickened.  Her mind began to float, and the world faded away...

How do you stand playing this game with no pvp?  I really cant imagine it, what do you do? 

Also, is there a main storyline to EQ at all?  </description></item><item><title>Nos grow up yourself</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1203347/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2004 09:43:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1203347</guid><dc:creator>Carribian</dc:creator><slash:comments>11</slash:comments><description>FIRST OF ALL I DID NOT ATTACK YOU, you attacked me and I defended myself and you being a nazi admin decided to lock me out of replying to your replies. 
SECOND OF ALL, as an admin why don't you fix the site so i can register, its been 3 weeks now that I keep recieving the same unsuccessful message for registering each time i try to register. 
THIRD OF ALL if you havn't played on a pvp server how the hell you going to comment on pvp related content and then claim all pvper's as annoying; come on you just post stuff without backing it up (saying something you want to stay doesn't make it true). Stay on your blue server if you even still pvp. 
FOURTH I havn't disobeyed any forum rule so don't give me that bull. And I havn't even attacked you in any negative manner.
LASTLY grow up yourself. Does it make you feel better at night to reply to posts you dont like attacking the author and then locking it so others can't reply (thereby giving yourself last words)? THIS WILL BE MY LAST POST anyone who has reads the previous posts can see you have no pvp mindset (you just arn't quick enough for the lifestyle), you misquote, misjudge, lie your ass off and plain out say anything you want to say as FACT and not oppinion. I quit playing eq over a year ago, I'll be playing eq 2 on the first red server as Carribian. When you said "im done" in the last post I would bet everything I owned on seeing just "one more post" from a guy who obviously has nothing better to do with admin powers than to talk shit on people without a way to back it up. GO AHEAD AND BAN ME. THIS IS MY LAST POST. MY WORD IS MY WORD. 

-Carribian (only thing i did was recharge i-hoops and set up scams; hp zone trick was to answer the endless questions people were asking on red servers in /ooc. But obviously you wouldn't know this since you never played on a RED.

If I had enough intelligence to figure out half the things I did on RZ then obviously I wouldn't be dummy. And where in my posts do you take  me to be a whiny pk? How did i "troll" you. I don't get that from my replies. "whiny thread"? You put me in the same class as those who "haven't a shread of intelligence" and people around me "go insane"? Come on you're just looking for the nitty gritty and not finding it so you're making shit up and assuming things without proof.
You just dont like me, just admit it. Did I grief you in gfay when I was level 10 years ago or what. 

"Your post was fine, until you decided to troll me and the board in general. Now, I get the pleasure of locking another useless, whiny thread on a PK server forum. It's odd how those tend to pop up mostly on PK server forums. Maybe because a large percentage of the population of PK servers are whiny, useless members of Everquest. I pity those PK members who actually have a shread of intelligence, as they must go insanse dealing with you lot."

Its roleplaying anti-pk's on rallos zek like you who made RZ fun, thanks for playing with us and thanks for the loot ;D

You guys want to know how to recharge? I'll tell you how... you guys want to know how to zone and get HP I'll tell you how... you guys want to do some scams I'll tell you how... you guys want some ways to gank I'll tell you how... 

In my eq lifetime I ganked in total about 1.5 million k on my various alts (none below level 24 btw)... what I did was use the friend system... /friend (player to be ganked)... anyone on my friends list accept Aligator was a 10k + twink we had "marked" in the bazaar and followed using unnamed alts... we would have notes on specific zones the player would be in, their level range (this can be done by conning them with different level ranges... anyone over level 28 we just didn't go for) or you can simply ask them or trick them or watch to see the spells they cast or the items they use (i.e some spells can be cast by a 24 but not a 20, and some weapons can be used only after 16 or 20 for example). So everytime Aligator and I would log on first we would check is our friend list and decide who to gank... the last step would be to engage them in a pvp zone and get a kill shot (AND IF YOU WANT TO KILL SHOT A HIGH END TWINK YOU NEED IVYANDERS HOOPS)... this item has 6 charges and does about 65 damage per charge for a rogue at level 24 and about 90 damage for a sk or necromancer at level 24 (these damages go lower at a lower level and go higher at a higher level) still though the best part is the item is INSTANT CASTABLE.. as fast as you can click it you can do about 480direct damage that is unresistable.. THAT IS HOW YOU FINISH MOST HIGH END TWINKS. 

Here was my main source of income but no far behind was the casino scam. When casinos started popping up we would try to find high end casinos where the person would probally be carrying in upwards of 20k on them... I would turn on my "group trading only button" and gamble 1k at a time till I won... I would in the same proximity of the casino have a high level druid friend (Aligator) already invited to my group BUT NOT JOINED YET.... when i won the bet after maybe 1 to 3 tries I would invite the casino player to join my group so he/she could pay me (this only works if the casino actually pays you when you win btw ;P )... when aligator would see that i had won, he would begin casting a port spell to a zone that had a quick load time (like steamfont)... when the casino joined my group to give me the money i would alert aligator and then my goal was to keep the casino distracted by telling him in group chat how i had gambled more money and that he/she owed me more, and by the time the person had time to respond aligator was 95 percent done casting the spell and only had to type /join a second before the spell went off. he would do that and we would port to a zone and kill the person becaues he/she would be so overloaded in weight they couldn't move a bunch... some people zone plug (just wait it out if you have time)... most i ganked in a casino scam was 90k for about 2 minutes of effort... 

Now, how to recharge and zone with lots of health... 
You need two of the same item to recharge... one needs to have full charges on it or near it... go to a newbie vender and buy out the complete bottom right square (newbie venders have like batwings and bone chips so buying out a square costs very little) THEN sell the item with the full charges, staying in the vendor window the entire time btw, THEN sell the "empty" item.... NOW buy both items back and THEY ARE BOTH FULL CHARGED ... remember, FULL FIRST, empty last..... 

Lastly, about zoning with more hps than you left with... IF YOU wear gear that adds a total of 300hps in total health and you zone into crushbone from gfay with 45 hps you will zone into crushbone with 300hps... if you have less health than the total amount of hp gear you are wearing, when you zone you will get "healed" to the total of all hp gear you're wearing... (this is how those level 9 twinks keep getting near full health zone after zone) 

I havn't played eq in about a year but this is how it was when i left and it had been like that since beta 4 to my knowledge so it should still be in effect... enjoy this knowledge I have no longer a need for it till eq 2

The point of a PvP server is too kill other players period.  Thats what makes the server great and why i switched over from a normal server.  Everyone is worried that they are going to die and lost that great weapon they worked so hard for, well guess what you really are going to die and lose those things you've worked so hard for, guess the game mimics life.  Some people just want to have it the easy way, for those folks go to a different server, $30 bucks to Snoy and all of your problems are solved.  Looking forward to killing as many of you as possible :)  </description></item><item><title>Old or New threats to PvP</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1203320/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2004 05:34:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1203320</guid><dc:creator>Violent Dwarf</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>In case u didnt read my other posts, I am about to join up again. And before i get FLAMES i am not a noob, just simply ignorant in the past year of EQ. I havent played in awhile. What are your oppinions on classes or players that u hate and cannot seem to get. I was thinkin about startin up a MAG or a bard. I had a nice lil bard but never really played the mag class. I mean it would seem that the MAG could PvP simply. He has the extra melee pet, DD, DS,AE, root, pet heal, and many other usefull spells if used right. I mean i know it is to ones opinion of who they chose. But who are the real pain in the ass classes. All personal opinions excepted. hahaha

Still remember my code from kunark and still have my Luclin cds and everything but i dont wanna haveta buy another kunark. Does anyone think they could help me out?  I would be forever in ur debt if someone could sell there old disc for cheap or maybe gear and pp if i can get my account going again. I will pretty much do whatever i can to atleast get the Kunark disc, like i said i have luclin still. my email is parkerpiper@hotmail.com i thank u for informative responses. I know i will probably haveta buy the CD but thought i might atleast try looking here among EQers first. Thank u all for consideration.
