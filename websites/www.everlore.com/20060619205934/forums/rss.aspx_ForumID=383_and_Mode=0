Sadly, my guild is rather small and my ability to motivate them is not on par with their ability to not want to do something that would get them killed ;)
So, I come here, to enlist, and gather many people of high fighting caliber, to join me in the slaying of the mighty dragon Faydedar. ( Or is he an eel? ;) )
If you are interested, id appreciate a post under this or a msg, in-game as Gyven or Krikit.
