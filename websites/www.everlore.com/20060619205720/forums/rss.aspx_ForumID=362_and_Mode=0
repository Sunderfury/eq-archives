It *WOULD* be great *IF* it worked correctly.  I have done probably close to 300 potions over the last couple days and the interface has stored *NONE* of the recipes I have used that were not already in there.

Am I doing something wrong here?  Has anyone developed a download that will feed all recipes into the eq file?  :)

1) It takes between 8 to 12pp to produce the potion

2) The SoW spell does not work in some caverns. I frequent Paludal Caverns and Shadow Haven often. Since you CAN'T cast SoW in those zones it becomes necessary to leave the zone to get SoW. The potions come in handy when you find yourself trying to outrun a mob of bandits.

So to all you whiners, I hope you find yourself in a situation like the one I described in item 2.</description></item><item><title>Newb Alchemy Qs</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1254818/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2003 03:12:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1254818</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>I am a lvl 6 barb shaman and had some questions about alchemy. I wasd looking at the recipies and was wondering if the potion will permanenaly bring up those stats. And how much would i be able to make on a Blood of Wolf potion if i sell it? I also wanted to know how much platinum i would have to spend. Any comments are welcomed.
