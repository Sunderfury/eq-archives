No one seems to post here very often from this server,though mostly silly and inane as the threads here are, Iget much enjoyment from the rants and flames and the wonderfully talented folks that come to share they'r oppinions and frustrations. I guess everyone on Zeb is working hard to reach that lvl 65 and gather up all the best loot, with no time to sit back and smell the roses. Either that or they only post on the guild boards. Alas its a pitty, since there are so many great folks that play there.</description></item><item><title>Would like your opinion...</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1665858/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2003 21:26:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1665858</guid><dc:creator>Hmm..</dc:creator><slash:comments>5</slash:comments><description>I am about to start a new account, meaning I will be deleting my current toons and starting new ones.  I was wondering what anyone would suggest for me.  I LOVE being main tank, but also LOVE to buff and heal.  And not to sound lazy, but also, the less I have to do the better, (kinda an oxymoron to everything I just said huh! lol).  Also, I prefer being in a group to going solo.  Oh ya, also love having a pet.  This is not a necessary thing, but much loved.  That's all I can think of...Let me know what you think! ThanX a grip!  Have a super day!  Many blessings in the form of few deaths and much leveling!

I'm just wondering if there are ever just-for-fun type events, such as the language fair just announced on FV, on this server.  That Fair sounded like fun, and a good change from the usual EQ session.  Do these things go on, and I just miss the announcement?

Admittedly, I can't offer much help myself, as I just returned to EQ after about a two-year break, and am not even a member of a guild.  So, I'm just wondering what's going on in the Zeb server, or where I might go to find out, or even whether anyone else who reads this site plays on Zeb ;).

So, anyone?</description></item><item><title>Testing sig...</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1665847/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2003 10:47:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1665847</guid><dc:creator>Occam</dc:creator><slash:comments>5</slash:comments><description>Ignore this...

I really do not have the patience to seek out the market for other players to sell anything to.

I do understand that the best way to make money is to sell amongst other players  (I still cannot believe that the going rate for a stack of Spiderling Silks is 40 plat. No Spiderling is safe around me) but there should be a reward for the friggin time it takes (and the brain rot from the tedium of the mindless, endless clicking from levelling tradeskills) in the form of a reasonable profit from selling crafted items to vendors for more than what the components cost.

My two cents worth from atop my soap box.

I started in mid/late March of 2001.  I didn't know a think about EQ, was very overwhelmed so I couldn't compare it between then and now.  I'd love to hear your insights.
