I've been playing on VZ for a while with my necro and mage and have been able to hold my own in PVP.  However I've recently started a Shammy (lvl 19), and am having a heckuva time PVPing with him (getting my butt kicked left and right).  I know Shamen aren't exactly the best PVP class, but I was wondering If anyone could give me some tips on the best tactics to fight other players with one?

Thanks

But...  there will be another all elven purist guld made very soon because we cannot let the dream of true racewar die.  If anyone who has an elf is interested in being a part of this hopefully very large movement, please send either Lannyan, Laenyen, Ruven or Sevenstitch a tell and you will find out all about it.   This is the way the server was meant to be,  all races for themselves.  So lets make it happen elves.

We are looking for members of ALL teams and ALL classes. 

This guild is a four team guild, it's true, but is a bit different than other four team guilds.. Each member of the guild is under the direct direction of only the officers within the guild on their team. Meaning that an elven member would only follow the policies of the elven officers of the guild, and not the human leadership.

There is a lot of potential for this guild to bring something new to the server as the leadership of the team within the guild decides how that team within the guild operates. From PVP to team interaction to everything.

If interested, take a look at the guild forums at...

http://legios.proboards20.com

Drop by and take a look. Feel free to express your opinions, ideas or just ask questions.

Enjoy and have fun.

Guild Leader,
Legios Del Norlalos.
