What skills do people recommend for a new Wizard?  Blacksmithing looks like it could make you some money but it doesn't look like it does anything for your character.  Perhaps tailor?

Ok, stupid stupid question.  I just got back into the game last night.  I played back in '99 or '00 and stopped.  I started playing as a High Elf Wizard and seem to be doing pretty good (haven't died yet).  In a couple of hours I even moved up to 3rd level.  

So here's my stupid question.  I killed a few fun little orcs and two of these made the wonderful threats that their clan will kill me or something.  Anyway, once or twice I found NODROPs (skulls I think) with these.  Now I know some of the higher level quests involve NODROPS so that you can't hand them off to newbs for them to move up.  I would assume these NODROP skulls would agro the orcs or something.  What is this?  If you pick one of these up you can't drop them and from there on orcs attack you whenever they see you or something?  I'm curious.  Anyone want to clear it up for a newb still trying to learn?

I've narrowed it down to 3 classes that I want to play, and am all ears on comments about each pairing. By the way, it will be on Rallos Zek server and I don't need to hear about once we are level 50+ cause that's a long, long ways away : )

1. Warrior- I have never gotten a Warrior past lvl 13 and that was a long time ago. I'm wondering if the lack of healing in a Warrior/Wizard combo is gonna be too big of a problem. Also, would it be boring?, Cause when I think of a warrior I just think, auto-attack, kick, and taunt til dead. Rinse repeat. Is there any excitement in playing todays Warrior?

2. Magician- Nothing really to say about this combo, do you think it would work well?

3. Shaman- This is the last option, sounds like it would be fun, the only thing I'm worried about is all the buffing. Seems like all the buffing would get very tiring. How do you think a Shaman/Wizard combo would fare?

I also wouldn't mind trying a rogue out, but Rogue/Wizard sounds like garabage, let me know if you disagree.

Thank you for any comments : ), I'm also gonna post what I would be if he chooses a Pally on the Pally boards so hop on over if you have Paladin experience : )</description></item><item><title>research help</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/898052/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2004 16:50:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:898052</guid><dc:creator>HTRHND</dc:creator><slash:comments>5</slash:comments><description>okay here is the deal..i am a lvl 29 wizzy..who has never done anything with research other then putting points into it at 16...hehe I don't even have any of the research spells to this point...my question is this..should I invest the time and effort into training this skill and get back the spells that I am lacking, or should I just drive on and continue to level and buy the spells if i see them for sell at the bazaar??</description></item><item><title>Need Help</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/898049/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2004 10:52:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:898049</guid><dc:creator>HTRHND</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>Hey all....I am a lvl 20 human wizzy and I can't find 2 spells and was hoping someone could tell me where to look to find them.  I have tried Qeynos, pok library bottom floor, eurdin, neriak, neriak library...and I have not been able to find these two spells.  The spells are Nexus Gate, and Garrisons Might Shock.  I was told that the could be found in Luclin, but don't know where...I looked in Shadowhaven but I didn't see a place that sold wizzy spell on the map.  

Also, I thought there was a place in pok that supposedly sold all of our spells...including the research ones.

thanks in advacne for your help

My guild is having this little contest for mains under lvl 55. The first person to ding 60 by 12/10/03 wins 10kpp. This is a very nice prize (being that I am forever broke).

I've been soloing raptors in TD for a while now and dinged 57 the other night. The problem is it seems kind of slow. Is there a place other than the raptors and PoP for me to solo when I am LFG that could possibly get me to 60 faster? I checked the quadding guide on Graffe but those zones 57+ seem a little too risky. If any one has any ideas, that would be nice.

Yes Necro's have good heavy hitting DoT's that stack, and they also have a pet so I'm not going to disagree that Necro's maybe be suppirior to Wizards depending upon battle tactics but when I hear about how Wizards can't put out dmg, i'd just like to say YOU SUCK!  Wizards have a great amount of damage to unleash provided you have the clearest of head to see all your options. imagin this... start off casting a blast of a three wave rain spell... then another three wave rain spell of another type provided you have two.  while they finish up you slap down your best dd... at 57 i can put down two rain spells that do from 600dmg a wave and the other 649dmg a wave... along with my ice comet landing in on the last wave of the rain.  now i dont know if i'm the only one doing the math here but thats 4867 dmg by the time your first rain spell is done being cast... maybe im slow or something but isnt 4867 dmg quite alot considering it can be used two or even three times a battle?  just expand your minds people, rain spells aren't just useful for groups of mobs...if ever good to use on groups of mobs.
