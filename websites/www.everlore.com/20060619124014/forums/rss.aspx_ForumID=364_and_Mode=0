My wrist is killing me but i'm almost at 248 in brewing with Mino Brews. So here is my question...

What did you do to get the last two points?

I don't want to try my trophy to get the last few points.. so pick a brew... I can forrage and am on "good guys" faction (if that makes any difference)
Thanx :)

Ever.
I never see any improvement, but it's okay since I seem to have started out with unnatural Alcohol Tolerance, but it goes up.....

Does Alcohol Tolerance give a little skill up message like other skills?

That would be great.
You are in a party and your tanks health goes down but your healer is low on mana or do not have a healer.
You would give him a drink and he would regen faster.

To start out, make fish wine.  Combine a fish, grapes, water flask, and bottle in the brew barrel.  THis will take you to a skill of 62.  If you can forage, combine a vegetables with a water flask to make vegetable oil.  that will take you to 102, I think.  Next is 2 times dwarven brewed stout.  2 dwarven ale, 2short beer, and a cask in the brew barrel.  This will take you to 142.  If you can forage, I say make Ginesh, a vegetable, flask of water, shortbeer, and a shotglass until 168.  From here it is the Faydwer Shaker.  elven wine, dwarven ale, gnomish spirits, mead, and a cask.  The shaker will go until 188.  The final thing to make is the Minotaur hero brew, which will get you to 248.  It is made with 3 malts, 2short beers, 2 water flasks, a yeast, and a cask.  From there.  THat is it.  As far as I know, that is  the highest you can get without making brewer master sign.  (which is very expensive)</description></item><item><title>Party On Quellious!

People brought all sorts of alcohol. It was fun! Probably about 150 people crouded around the bank in the zone of Kelethin. People of all classes, races, and levels joined as we went along. Once I had enough alcohol I went into different zones and telling the people about the party. When I went to every zone in Faydwer, I went back to Kelethin and had some more drinks. But when I got back to Kelethin there was over 270 people in the zone! My alcohol tolerence went from about 59 to about 223! And my characters level was only 14! I was a level 14 druid with a alcohol tolerence of 223! By level 60 I'll probably have over 1,000. Maybe more. I tried to get drunker, but I had too much of a tolerence! This was fun! And with my best EQ friend by my side, we tried to go kill D'vinn and Crush. That was the funnest day of my EQ life.</description></item><item><title>A different kind of drink?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1259578/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2002 13:34:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1259578</guid><dc:creator>Milereni</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>Hi there :) I'm a mage of the 21st year and i am just starting up brewing :)

Here is my question:

As a young mage i had just died and was standing naked by my bind spot when a kind high level player gave me fish rolls (20) and (20) "drinks"

Now these drinks where drinkable (not alcoholic) but they seemed to last for ever... one stack lasted me 3 weeks of playing time saving me mass mana that would have been used to summon water...

Any ideas? I don't remember what it was called but it was in a pink bottle... that's all i remember...

Is this drink baught or brewed? and if brewed, How???
Thanks :)

Even tried switching Short Beer for Short Ale and normal Ale and even tried using a cask also. 

Is this recipe nerfed or what?  My skill is 180 and you'ld think I would get a failure or something.  But nada.  All I get is: "You can't combine these items in this container!"  In red letters.  

Anyone know the actual recipe?  Or if the recipe was bugged/nerfed?  I already reported as a bug and a GM said she was gonna post it as a bug.  But you never know. </description></item></channel></rss>
