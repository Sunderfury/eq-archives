Hmm a new thread i like the sound of that.
(If new thread heres my part)
   It was deep in the Lake Of Ill Omen, a Paladin of a lost guild was traveling alone. The Zera'kai was a group of secret paladins, trained as well as warriors but swore complete secrecy. His name was Aanoen Bladeslinger (/ooc my toons name on terris-thule) he kept his Soulfire at his side, Ghoulbane on his back. He was very fond of the art of dual wieldingm using his Ghoulbane most of the times with a Sword Of Morning or using two Katana's of some sort. Though he was skilled with using bigger weapons and could hold his ground. He wandered alone, always alone. He heard of a sword of pure flame, something of a myth really. Though he knew he would need something of that power for the upcoming months. An evil was coming, one that would take him face to face with Innoruk himself.

1 on 1.  No problem...3 on 1 without the mystic, no problem...toss the mystic in there with that blindness spell, I kill 1 maybe two of them before I'm toast...of course it doesn't help when I'm trying to self-buff and I end up buffing the Lizzies...

Anyway, I need those stupid dolls the mystics drop.  Only, I get toasted soloing against the camps trying to get them!!!

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Right now I'm still in the planning stages.  The character I'm using for it needs to get to level 20.  Once that happens I'll be recruiting.  Both you and your character will have to be female, and between levels 10 and 20.  I need all the help I can get, and I really want to dedicate to this!

As I said it will still be a little bit before this gets started, but by getting all the girls we can now the planning stage can go along much quicker, and the more people we have helping, the better our plans will be!  I really want to make this guild great.  I want it to be a fun way for women who love EQ to come together and just relax.  And someday I want us to be big, and do big things.  Helping eachother on epics will be one of our biggest goals.  And by requiring that our first ten people start out between levels 10 and 20, there is a greater chance of us all being high level enough to help when it comes time for epics.

I'm rambling.  *laugh*  So if you think you're interested please email me at shalyndria_garenheart@hotmail.com  I'd love to hear from you!</description></item><item><title>Topic Moved: Selling 32 druid account...</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1174778/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2002 19:11:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1174778</guid><dc:creator>Myethia Sparrowswing</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>This topic was moved to: EverQuest - General - Staff Lounge
