However, if you are below this, there is still a chance for a guild invite after the process has been completed and favorable results have been found.

So, if you are intrested head over to http://cotp.guildportal.com and check out our charter. If you are still intrested after that feel free to fill out our application!

Started a Ranger recently. And he is lvl 21+. Wood Elf Ranger bye the name of Ryku..havent decided a last name yet, but that ussually takes me a while. I like my names to be good, or ones that mean something. Anyways, I havent been too concerned with looking for a guild for him. My main is in a great guild with good people, but I want something new. Been playing for more then a year. So I pretty much know what I am doing...but Hey, I could learn some things. We all could. So if any Repectable guilds accepting new members. Send me a tell. To Ryku or Barow. Or just post below. And by Respectable, I mean experienced with rules and regulations. No nessacery high lvled players, (which wouldnt be bad). Just some good wholesome Everquest players.
