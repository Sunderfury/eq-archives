But to get to the point reason i am on a new computer is our old one was in a flood and was lost along with the cd case somewhere along the line i did come up with the cd and the books for the game.... when doing the registration after installing the game it asked for an account key code from the cd or cd case well i dont see one on the cd and as i said the case was lost in the flood.... is there a default code i can use to finish the registration or does anyone know what i can do to get a code?

Any and all help anyone can and does provide would be greatly appreciate and thank you in advance as well~!!</description></item><item><title>Where 2 group at 25</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/900660/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2003 19:41:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:900660</guid><dc:creator>Straad</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>not just where is a good place to hunt

The crate rotates about 180 degrees when you click on it.  I have not found anything that is activated when you click on it.  It also has some figures painted on it.  

The crate's location in Skyfire 
LOC: Negative 504 Positive 2197

I have a level 22 human Shadow Knight...

*waits for people to stop snickering*

I want to head over to LOIO for a few levels and I have a couple questions:

1 - Which main port will NOT kill me?  Do I go through FV or OT?

2 - What's the SAFEST way to get there.  I'm patient, but I don't feel like getting throttled enroute.  I can think of three routes:
   a) OT -&gt; FM -&gt; LOIO
   b) FV -&gt; LOIO
   c) Nexus -&gt; DL -&gt; FM -&gt; LOIO.

"c" is the quickest way for me...but I have little desire to cross DL at level 22.  Not sure I'd even make it.

"b" sucks b/c of the spiders...and I think I'm KOS in FV anyway.

"a" isn't actually too bad...if I'm not KOS there then atleast the goons will leave me alone and a well timed sow should get me past FM.  But this leads to another question...how do I get from Qeynos to Oasis?  Will the guards and citizens in high hold attack me?  I could probably buy a port but I hate bothering druids for camo and a tp.

Is there any proof of that?  What is an average time of killing front door items to get one of those rare drops?  I know it's random I am just looking for an estimate from someone that has played there alot.</description></item><item><title>Question!</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/900643/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2002 12:59:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:900643</guid><dc:creator>KatsumiTsukiyama</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>Is it a good idea to start with this one first?

It may be annoying but I can live with it even though it sure isn't easy.  I think the faction problems are just another interesting though annoying element of being a lizard.
