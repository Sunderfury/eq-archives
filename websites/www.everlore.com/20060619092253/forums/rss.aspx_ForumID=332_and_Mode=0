I stopped playing on the server about a year ago and I started up again and there were barely any people in Kelethin...I remember the bank there used to be crowded all the time, and when I went there last night there was only but me and one other person there.  Maybe there aren't that many people on Wednesday nights I dunno, but just seemed deserted to me....so is it just me or is Cazic Thule not as populated as it used to be??</description></item><item><title>A note on the supposed 'Lazy GM's'</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1163301/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2003 09:37:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1163301</guid><dc:creator>RavenSentinel</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>When you find them sitting around somewhere, they aren't just not doing anything.  They have to be logged into the server to answer petitions.  When they are just 'sitting' around, that is most likely what they are doing.  For the most part, if you see 2 sitting around, then they are probably with a apprentice guide doing something &amp;lt;whatever they do, no one knows&gt;.  The reason they go and hide is because for some reason whenever we go anywhere, we get sent hundreds of tells from anyone who happens to notice the name, and when we don't answer, everyone thinks they are being ignored &amp;lt;yes I know its a long sentance :) &gt;.  Believe me, the job would get done alot faster if this wasn't the case.

E notado que en nuestro servidor falta una guild que sea dedicada alreadedor de aquellos que (como yo) hablan Español (como su primer lengua o su segunda/tercera/etc.).

Me gustaria invitar a todos aquellos quienes esten interesados en formar una comunidad de jugadores que hablan Español a comunicarse conmigo para formar el guild.  Ya somos algunos los que estamos interesados y nos gustaria oir de otras personas mas.

Este guild es principalmente para apoyarnos unos al otro y ayudarnos.  Todos los niveles seran aceptados.  No somos un guild ahorita que caza grandes cosas, pero con el apoyo de la comunidad, esperamos crecer poco a poco.

Bueno, supongo que ya e dicho demasiado.  Gracias por su atencion, y por favor contactenme los interesados a juan99950@msn.com.  Tambien si saben de otra guild que habla Español en el servidor Cazic-Thule, aganmelo saber.

Gracias!

Anyone else going to make one?
Sure wish soon, they would start posting somewhere, on what these races can wear, etc. Then I could pick up a few things fer me new "Toad" to wear when she is born ;)

I am assuming that these new races, will be able to wear the same items as say a wizzy and such, but don't quote me there. :(

I am torn between a Warrior and or a Wizzy!!

What about you all??? ;)

I play on the CT server and am interested in buying 3 items from you high level pottery makers. Course one of these inc metal bits, so won't forget you Smithy's. :)

I need these made or if one of you have in your bank, gaining dust.

1.  Bread Tin
2.  Pot
3.  Muffin Tin

I especially need the Pot ASAP, so was wondering if someone could help me out here on these items.

Could meet you in PoK by bank when you have made them.
