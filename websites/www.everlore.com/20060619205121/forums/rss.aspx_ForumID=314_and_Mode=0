I was part of the beta testing for the mac version of EQ and me and my friends all got free lvl 65's to run around and play with for 3 months.  Well during that time there was an erudite paladin who's name was Niffurn who I met and grouped with and killed Trakkanon with in Sebilis (with additional help of course)).  Anyways this lvl 65 erudite paladin was absolutely amazing, he had white armour but with a grand cape and a HUGE LONG white and blue jousting weapon (not sure if it was piercing or 2H slash.  Anyways this guy had like a ton of HP and healed our group of EIGHT (that's 8) by himself as we owned our way through sebilis.  Not only that but he landed crippling and critial blows every single hit.  (i think all his AA's were maxed out)  

But anyways I was just wondering What are the 'erudite paladin ONLY' items in the game that I hear so much about, or where can I find information about them?

Thanks a lot,

For the hilt part of the quest you have to kill Xicotl, a Shadow Knight in Mistmoore. De guides state that he's level 40 or so. 

At what level can a paladin hold his camp and solo him?

For some reason, I have not been able to gather too many pp in my travels (the most I have ever had at once was 2,700 pp) so I may have leveled past my armor.  So at 55 I went 100% AA and have gotten run3 and regen3.  I have one more and am halfway through another to get CS 1 (or should i get ND?).  I was wondering if it was bright to stay at 55 and wait till I get some more AA's to move on or should I stop and start leveling again.  For some reason I cant get enough money to get any good armor (I have had one armor upgrade since lvl 48 heh) so I don't know what to do.  Where can I go at 56 anyway?  I currently mostly hunt PoI and PoN.  I hear PoV is great but I don't have a flag and I would have a hard time getting group.
Thanks

I just got my friend playing EQ and he wants to play a Pally. {score one for you guys :)} Thats the reason this is on this board , if I posted in wrong place sorry. I was wondering what is a decent duo combo to go with a pally. I want to make a new guy so I can train , teach and show him how the game works in general. I whould prefer something non KOS. Also please keep in mind this duo group is NON twinked and starting from scratch . I whould appreciate any suggestions / race combos to go with a high elf pally.

Sincerly ,

I've just started a Pally, now level 10 ;-))  So far I've just been doing 1HS and 2HS.  Can I stay with them or SHOULD I start doing others (1 or 2handed piercing or 1HB or 2HB) for later levels ?

Easier and cheaper if I stay simple though.

Many Thanks

I'm looking for ideas, and lists of how other paladins are progressing in their AAs.  Erobate finally hit 62 (with a small buffer) and I plan on going 100% AAxp for about 6-12 months (or until I have all the most important AAs).

My current plan is this:

Run Speed 3 - done
Regen 3 - done
Combat Fury 3 - 1 of 3
Natural Durability - 0 of 3
Slay Undead - 0 of 3

I'm wondering if I should switch SU3 and ND3...get Slay Undead first, as it will assist me in getting faster AAs.  ND3 won't, not really.  It'll help in the long run, of course, when tanking.  But in the quick, down and dirty, AAxp grind...SU3 should help more.

Raid buffed, I come in at 5555hp and around 1200 ac (might be a bit higher, I think - I don't pay too close attention to the exact #).  From what I understand, this isn't bad.  No, it's not great, but it's not bad either.  It's just shy of the 6K that a warrior friend had at 60, IIRC.

Anyway, gimme some of the AA orders that you guys did, are doing, will be doing.  Just so I can see how odd my list is in comparison...or if I'm even making a huge mistake somewhere down the line.</description></item></channel></rss>
