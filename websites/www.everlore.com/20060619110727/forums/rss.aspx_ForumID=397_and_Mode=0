  Im a 52 wanderer on Ayonae Ro, I'm looking for more people to hunt with. I am professional, courteous and efficient in groups and solo/partnering. I just need to meet more nice people on Ayonae Ro. I have had offers to join guilds but I am very skeptical till I get to know people first, I have been completely screwed over by immature, greedy and careless people in EQ too many times. 
  So. You have my spellbook at your service anytime, please post here if youre interested in grouping/making a new friend or if you have a guild with mature individuals who could use a 52 druid. 
Thanks all and happy hunting!

Currently by our lonesome we do not stand a chance against the world ahead of us, but with a guild or two to ally with it might be possible. We could start a chat channel that is secret that no one else knows about and use that as the guild's Alliances chat so we could all comunicate, have HUGE raids, and just generally be allies. Please post here if interested.

P.S. I know that someone is going to say something like "You're never going to take out any of the other guilds" but really, that isn't our intention.</description></item><item><title>30k here for 25k on Druzzil</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1663907/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2002 04:11:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1663907</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>Edited.
