For three long years I have waited, plotting, exacting my revenge. Many of those who would remember have perished. Many of those who would aid me as well. No matter. My dream shall be realized! The followers of Bertoxxulous have been persecuted for far too long! Antonious Bayle has reigned over Qeynos in the favor of Rodect Nife. Kane and even Bloodsaber Scragg have sat idol in the depths of their sewers conspiring, but producing nothing. The time to act is upon us. The Black Dawn Horde is returning to Veeshan. We shall rise up and topple our intolerant government! But we shall not stop there. Qeynos shall be the example by which ALL cities of Norrath shall fall! Cleanse your soul with the purity of evil! The Black Dawn returns! Muhahaha ha ha!!!!!</description></item><item><title>Veeshan is Great except for.....</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1253086/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2004 06:24:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1253086</guid><dc:creator>Pitiful</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>Pravus Dei and FoH are guilds full of jerks who do nothing but play EQ all day and would rather make out with a computer than a hot person.
