Please post which one you would go with.

Thanks in advance..

I wanted to post this up because I have spend the last 2 hours reading all of the messages posted and I needed to say something.

Anyways I cant' sleep because of the pain , I will explain why ...

about 8 months ago my family doctor booked an appointment for me with a throat specialist after he had found a suspicous mass in my throat.

I then undergo a seriesof tests , more important a needle biopsy that finds a nodule of about 5 cm ( wich is pretty big beeing it is in my throat ).

Sadly the results are inconclusive wich means they will need to perform a thyroidectomy as soon as possible( that is the term used when they remove the thyroid gland ).

At this point I am still left in the dark not knowing if I have cancer or not .
trust me , when you are 28 years old , cancer is not a word that you want to use in your everyday vocabulary.
Anywho I go to the hospital , the surgery is done, everything went well .

Oh yes , there was an analyst in the operating room to tell the surgeon if it was cancer or not and if it was , had it attacked other areas of the throat so far and so forth . 

So the result ??
Angels in heaven , I have been spared hehe ...

Now the reason I am posting this is because I am hurt about all of the nasty things I have seen posted up here..
Now i am not trying to preach or anything all I want to say is , plz , before you open your mouth and say crapy things to someone in EQ ,

before you vent or you scream or do nasty things like .. for ex what was her name? Ewle I think ... 

try and think that some people have it a lot worse then you do , that behind that character there is a human beeing there , not a NPC ..
I play EQ because when I am sick (and trust me it isnt' that good at all )and I have to stay home
 
or when I have a good spell and I am strong enough to work and do both.
But why ?? because it makes me feel good and I love the friends that I have made over the past 3 years almost 4 soon . 
It's my escape from my reality where most of the time I am sick
In EQ if I die , I can rezz myself hehe... Funny that I chose a cleric as my main.

Anyways , my struggle in life , and for me it's everyday are making me more and more aware of whats realy important.
 
I would never post something up here to hurt someone or judge or laugh at their opinions but all I want to say to you , and you know who you are .. 

The younger ones that are not well as mature I guess or I prefer saying havent had time to travel the road as much hehe plz , you can always get your point accross with kind words.
And sadly their are more then likely older people that act that way.
Regardless, all I am saying Is just take responsibility for what you say because there is a consequence , there is always one, and that's the impact that you have on that person you may not realize how much you hurt them.

Change of subject .. Just want to let kasherana,Wargoth,malakor,Mosher,Leadaas(cant' wait for your return:))
hotplate(miss you )Cindale,boxwood,Inflict,Benwen,Spirituss,Lilbozz,and I know I am forgetting more ...
I love u guys , I want to say thank you for the support when Ailolwen passed away 
for your patience, for all of your help ,god knows sometimes I dont show up for a while 
Thanks for sticking around and for everything
Just thought I would let people know why I love this game, because of peops like you 8D ....

You are all great friends ... And another thing I love this server , yes there's some pretty funky characters but man is there ever a lot of good and genuinely kind people !!!

P.S. Plz feel free to reply if you like .. always love to hear what others have to say 8D.

Just remember these things:
-You don't have to be faster than the bear, you just have ot be faster than the other person running from the bear.(Curtosey of my friend's friend.)

-You should walk a mile in someone's shoes before you criticize them, that way, you'll be a mile away from them, and you'll have their shoes.(Curtosey of my friend's friend.)

-Don't bother to run from a grizzly, it'll chase you, knock you down, and eat you.  of course, you could always climb a tree, that way, you'll get a nice view of it's mouth before it knocks down the tree and eats you.

-Eagles may soar high, but Weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.(Curtosey of my friend).

-Two Wrongs don't make a right, but three lefts do.(Also Curtosey of my friend)

Darkness Falls:
Death, destruction, darkness,
a never-ending plague that sweeps
across those whose souls are tormented by the light.
Those who believe in righteousness, goodness, hope,
those who don't know mankind's true destiny,
a destiny so dark and sinister,
that it will eventually make us all fall to our knees.</description></item><item><title>GUILD STARTING</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1170812/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2003 13:49:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1170812</guid><dc:creator>Angelic Spydir</dc:creator><slash:comments>5</slash:comments><description>Good day and well met
