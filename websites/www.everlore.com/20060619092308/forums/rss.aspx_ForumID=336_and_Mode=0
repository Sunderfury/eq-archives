He is in a small room connected to the dividing wall in the zone, but sometimes I go there to turn in Orc belts and he isn't there. I assume he is under the floor or something because rangers have told me he is on track. This sucks when trying to turn in belts.

You know the one with the thug. Anyways, I had camped there from the night before. When I logged in the next day, I notice that I had taken a beating and should probably rest up a bit before I slay anymore Dervs. I did the usual look around to see if I was the only one in the area. Looks clear. I rest. Pop! there's a derv. I decide to use my bow and call him over for a bite to eat.OOps, looks like his friends want to come too. I ended up pulling 3 of them. I pulled them away from the camp and start fighting. One down and two to go. At this point, I've got about half my life left but I know I can take these guys. As long as nothing else comes along, i'm good. But wait, whats this?? I can see in the distance between whacks, that a little halfing is pulling the Thug and he's headed right for me. In my head, i'm yelling "no,no, go away, take that guy somewhere else". But he ends up training the Thug right next to me. I see the little halfling come around and sit right smack dab in front of me , looks like he's enjoying the show. Well, a minute or so passes and bingo! i die. That cost me two blues and almost sent me back to 18. I was pretty angry. I made the long run back to retrieve my body and guess who shows up?? The halfling and his cohorts. As i'm recovering my items he's laughing at me and telling me my gear sucks. Well, I choose to ignore him. But he's still going on. "Let's duel" he says. He's a 32 pally and he wants to duel me, a 19 warr ?? I refuse his ridculous offer and go on my way to a safe spot to sit. He follows me and asks me "what's up." I tell him i'm a bit sore that he trained that Thug on me and I don't wish to speak with him. He tells me that" I was going to die anyway". This is just not cool! Never have I encountered such an ass on EQ. I know that this post is a bit long but I had to vent. There was no good reason for this little guy to do what he did. If you had a problem with me pulling those dervs little guy, you could have just told me you were there hiding in the shadows, but instead you resorted to hostility and you lost any chances of gaining a fun loving warrior as a friend. I hope the next person you do this to is a GM or Guide and he/she might whoop your ass and teach you a lesson. Just because you are quite a few levels higher than someone and have better gear or are "Twinked" dosen't mean you are any better of a person.

We were up to 96 main chars and about 30 alts then once again we are slipping downwards. We try to have events that will be fun for all, or gain exp, or just learn to hunt together. But for the past many months we are lucky to see 5 show up for the event. About 4/5 of our members never come to the forums to catch up on guild doings either. 2-3 months ago we had almost 1/2 of members above lvl 40. All seemed well and good. Our event calendar was full mainly from our allies inviting us on hunts. In the last 3 weeks we have lost at least 2 dozen lvl 45+ members to other guilds. At least we know our past members will become an asset to that guild. It's frustrating to work long and hard to become a well known guild with a great reputation thinking we soon ready for the planes or the next uber dungeon to realize if we raid anything now it better not be any harder then Black Burrow. So tell me what does your guild do to keep your members happy and interested in staying with you and not another guild? Please reply to this post or e-mail me. Any honest answers will be welcommed as i am not ready to call this guild quits. Not until i am the only 1 left  standing then no way :) Thank you.

Can anyone tell me of a good place to check for a simple to use webpage? We also use ezboards for our forums. I looked at Guildmagic tonight but that was not what i looking for.
