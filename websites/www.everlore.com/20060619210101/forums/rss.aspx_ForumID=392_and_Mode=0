Is this true, or am I going to have to do other quests that I havent already?  

Sorry if this sounds a bit Noob, but I guess I still am.  

Also, are there any quest only spells for the Shaman?

As for doing it the long way, I've been through all the steps, got my Child's Tear, and I'm ready for the last two battles in CoM.....EXCEPT I can't seem to get my faction past amiable. I'm a bit peeved, since I went step by step....I guess I should do the RM turnins over and over to max out faction, but I can't afford a Spiritstone yet to shorten the travelling time.

Good luck completing the Epic.

As i quite often posted in this forum, i let you all know i finaly finished my Epic last Saturday. Here is a summary and some pictures i took of it (link to our guild's gallery).

&lt;A HREF="http://web1.249238.vserver.de/vbulletin/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=35975#post35975" TARGET="_BLANK"&gt;http://web1.249238.vserver.de/vbulletin/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=35975#post35975&lt;/A&gt;

I did the Epic entirely, all the way it was supposed to be done. Didn't cheat at anytime and i can tell you it's the nicest quest i've done so far. Here are my conclusions on main points about Epic Quest :

Test of Patience : You have to wait about 30/40 mn underwater, get some fish scales to cast Enduring breath on you. Also, check you always have invisibility on you (just remove it when Abe spawns to talk to him). This part isn't hard if you take care of being invisible, just be patient.
* Forces i had with me for this event : none.

Black Dire : Easy fight when you are 45 or above. I didn't have to run through castle to kill his PH, he was up. Killed it and his 4 pets in like 1 mn.
* Forces i had with me for this event : 1 guildie shaman (lvl 60).

The REALLY boring thing for me was to get the Spectral Courrier to spawn (CoM) and drop the RIGHT item (don't drop it all the time). I had to kill it like 10 times before i got the Studend's Log. Asked other shaman among the guild, they all looted if after 1 to 4 attempts so it seems i've been quite unlucky on this one. Other 5 pages are common drop.
* Forces i had with me for this event : none.

Lord Ghiosk : He isn't hard if you got enough people. I did him when we went initialy to CoM for one of our enchanter's epic. His mob didn't spawn so we did reavers to pop Lord Ghiosk. We engaged one reaver who respawned SIXTY SEVEN times in a row. Lord Ghiosk also spawn along with the 5th reaver. Killed him really quickly. 
* Forces i had with me for this event : 10 guildies (lvl 56-65).  

High Scale Kirn : Hardest thing is to convince enough people to come with you to the Hole. An enchanter is an absolute necessity if you want it to be done smoothly, easily and quickly. Took us about 45 mn / 1 hour from zone in to the time we killed him.
* Forces i had with me for this event : 10 guildies (lvl 55-62).

The Tear : I'm lucky i'm in a guild able to clear entire Plane of Fear. As we regularly raid there to kill CT, it showed no difficulty for me to get my Tear. In fact, i looted my Tear at a time i didn't even killed Lord Ghiosk. Remember also that the tear isn't MQ'able at all anymore.
* Forces i had with me for this event : Most of the guild (lvl 55-65) (did this on a CT raid).

Neh'Ashiir : No difficulty at all, basic fight. She went down in like 25 seconds if not less. She won't really harm you if you got a good tank to hold aggro after turn in.
* Forces i had with me for this event : 10 guildies (lvl 56-65)

Lord Rak'Ashiir : Well, i died like most shaman do here. When i handled the item i was at 40% health and 15% mana (had rebuffed all people who came + pets). The fight took about 3 to 5 minutes, no one but me and Lord Rak'Ashiir died. Positionning is the key in this fight (we did it in the throne room, definitly the best spot for this, just handle the item, go in a corner and wait you die. Magician pets will continue the fight for you (we had 2 lvl 60+ magician's pet) while the rest of the team is safe on the stairs.

WOOT ! AT LAST I GOT MY SPEAR OF FATE !
(happens the same day i dinged 57, was a nice Saturday).

Last night we went to the City of Mist for my shaman Epic (i had to kill Lord Ghiosk who spawn from reavers). We engaged 1 reaver who chain respawn...67 (yes, sixty seven) times, all this started from a single reaver ! Lord Ghiosk spawned on the 5th reaver, along with a new reaver. I went there with 10 people from guild, all lvl 55 to 65. From those 67 unstoppable respawn chain, we only had a single member who died around the 30th reaver (a blind wizard, went down in 3 sec).

So, be warned that when  you pull a single reaver you can, in fact, pull an entire chain (thought they will come 1 by 1). Groups who don't bring in CoM the forces i had the chance to bring with me can avoid such a situation by having a wizard/druid having an evac ready so if Lord Ghiosk spawn along with a new reaver, let the shaman loot his 3 books then evac :-)

Also, notice that the reavers are unslowable and will resist ALL spells requiering ANY resist check (spells without check will land). 

Last, keep in mind that the reavers have the abilty to blind you, and it will happen at least once each fight on each people meleing them. For your information, we looted 7 Jade Reavers and 1 Shimmering Partisan out of this 67 respawn chain. Even if they usualy dont respawn more than 4/5 times, keep this info in mind for your futur raids in the CoM.

HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE !
