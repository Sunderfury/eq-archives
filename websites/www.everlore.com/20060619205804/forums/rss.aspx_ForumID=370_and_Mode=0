Not as much as blacksmithing though. Master Tailers can make 10 Slot back packs, renforced Leather armor which is a plus for Monks, and other fine Armor Pieces.</description><dc:language>en-US</dc:language><generator>CommunityServer 1.1 (Build: 1.1.0.50615)</generator><item><title>The natural way to 150s+?</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1280286/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2004 05:58:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1280286</guid><dc:creator>Johnnymc</dc:creator><slash:comments>2</slash:comments><description>Copied from eqbeastlord.com:

"My name is Johnnymc, and I'm addicted to Evercrack.

I tried to quit about a year ago, but I've secretly been missing it. Suddenly, however, my buddies at school want to play. We've decided to make things a bit more challenging than usual by following this rule:

No communications at all with other people besides each other. That means no grouping, no bartering, no buffing/recieving buffs, and no chatting with people who don't go to our school."

Because I won't be able to trade for higher lvl armors and camping for them would be tough if not impossible, I thought that maybe tailoring would be a good idea. Studded Acrylia is pretty nice stuff for a mid30s-40s beastlord. In fact, considering that I'll probably use PSU's til the mid 30s, studded acrylia armor would be very nice.

I'm going to have to camp everything myself, except what friends will trade me. Where should I hunt for stuff and what should I make? I don't want to do multiple skills but I will if I have to.

Note: a friend will probably be BSing to help me with studs.</description></item><item><title>Conversion LQ, MQ, HQ</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1280283/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2003 04:52:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1280283</guid><dc:creator>Shanke Overkill</dc:creator><slash:comments>3</slash:comments><description>So I know you can downgrade by skinning, but what about upgrading?
