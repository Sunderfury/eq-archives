This is my first everquest character, yes I am a n00b to EQ, flame if you wish.... but i dont want to be one of those idiot rangers that comes across as useless. So, if y'all could help me out, with some suggestions, or tips, good places to go, hunt etc. I would REALLY appreciate it. </description></item><item><title>Weapons</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/793288/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2004 15:35:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:793288</guid><dc:creator>Shadowdemon Masteroftheforest</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>I use a Stained axe of the Scions/Architect's scepter OR  Axe And Fabled Short sword of the ykesha, OR War Marshall's Bladed Staff

(any edits of mine are in parenthesis)

Strength: `Physical Strength`; affects:
1) how much you can carry
2) how much melee damage you deliver to a target
3) how fast you learn some (offensive) skills

Stamina: `Health and Constitution`; affects:
1) maximum number of hit points at each level

Dexterity: `Coordination`; affects:
1) how much damage you deliver with a bow/thrown weapon
2) time between attacks
3) how fast you learn certain skills
4) how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark

Agility: `Physical agility`; affects:
1) your probability of being hit in combat
2) how much damage you take per hit
3) how fast you learn some (defensive) skills

Wisdom: affects:
1) how fast you learn specific skills.
2) maximum mana at each level.

Ranger Statistic Modifiers:
+5 Strength, +10 Stamina, +10 Agility, +5 Wisdom

Questions I have about Ranger statistics--
1) Does Strength, in any way, affect the damage output of a ranger-wielded bow?
2) Does Agility, in any way, affect the speed or haste of a ranger-wielded bow?
3) Does Agility have any effect on a ranger's offense of any kind? Can it be considered a 100% Defensive Statistic?
4) At low-end levels are Hit point modifiers more effective than added stamina, or vice versa?
5) At high-end levels are Hit point modifiers more effective than added stamina, or vice versa?
6) If "attack" is the most important statistic, does this mean Dexterity is the reigning king of ranger statistics? or rather, is it Strength? or possibly, a comination?
7) If one asked you to assign the following choices of statistics in the order--from highest to lowest--in which they are most relevant to a ranger's needs, how would you answer them?
Your choices of statistics to assign are:
"Stength" "Stamina" "Dexterity" "Agility" "Wisdom"

Thank you for reading this, and if you answered even one question, I bow to you.  Hopefully your wisdom
