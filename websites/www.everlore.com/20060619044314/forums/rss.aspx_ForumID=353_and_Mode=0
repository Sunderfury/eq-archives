"New Deal was President Franklin D. Roosevelt's program to pull the United States out of the Great Depression in the 1930's." (World Book, "New Deal") The plan of the New Deal was a lot programs that where meant to counteract the problems of the depression by providing jobs for unemployed, and also giving several new rights to different people that already had jobs, also it effected things as broad as prices for goods.

	What Triggered the need for the new deal was the great depression which was caused by the stock market crash on black Tuesday, which in turn caused a lot of the rich to lose most of there money and created a 25% unemployment rate. And when FDR took office in 1933 he kicked off the new deal programs after about 3 months of being in office.

	FRD put the new deal into action by two sets of actions. The first set was a set of programs. There where four major ones. Bank laws which made banks have insurance for people up to $5,000. An agriculture commission was formed to regulate growing of crops but made the food shortage worse. A industry and labor commission was formed making minimum wages. And the last program it created was one for the jobless people and it put many of them to working doing public services. The next set of actions taken where a set of three acts. The work progress act which provided jobs doing public works, the national labor relations act which allowed unions to be made. And social security act which provided old people money from the government.

Effects of the new deal decision caused America to stay working somewhat for a wile before congress killed all the programs in fear of them being too much like soscialism. The new deal programs wile they where still around working quite well in my belief. Because well frankly I believe in socialism.

	In 1938 the new deal was laid to rest by the supreme court and congress saying that all of the programs where uncionstual, everyone became jobless for a wile and America went back into deep depression for another five years before pearl harbor happened which threw the USA into the second world war which provided jobs in the military or making things for the military.

I am interested in a server to server trade of resources. I am now playing on The Nameless but I used to play on Prexus. If anyone here is moving to Prexus and has resources on The Nameless they would like to profit from, I would like to talk about a deal. On Prexus, I have several nice items (nothing way uber, but nice) that I just hate to walk away from if I can somehow trade them. For instance, I have 10+ Deluxe Sewing Kits, a good amount of plat, and some nice armor and weapons. 

You can reply to me here, or via email.

Thanks
