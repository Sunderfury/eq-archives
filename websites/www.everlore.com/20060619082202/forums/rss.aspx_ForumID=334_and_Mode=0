     So you want to know what a good class/race to be is... Well I do reccomend the Monk... They are much more fun because you are always in the action and if you are in great danger with your hitpoints you can either Mend, and if that fails you can always feign death without using Mana like the Necromancers have to... :D. And on the race I would reccomend the Human... I have a 35 Monk and I have a ton of fun grouping, but I also have fun soloing if possible. Also going up to a higher mob and Feign Deathing RULES! Well any questions either post it or send a tell to Correy or Swingin on E'ci. PO

This is the old Otavis, now known as Kennasi in game. I sold my EQ/Otavis account about 2yrs ago to a nice guy and hopefully he kept her reputation going well. LOL!

It's been almost 2yrs and I've got the EQ bug again. I've started a Druid, her name is Kennasi and she is all of 6th level right now.

No, I'm not asking for pp or to be twinked... I just hope some of my old buddies are hanging out on E'ci and I can say "hey!" to them in game.

Give me a holler if you remember me!

Hear ye! 

Knights of the Holy Blade is hosting a Paladin "Best of the Best" Competition for Levels 47-52 at the Qeynos Arena at High Noon CST on 31 August 02. SIGN UP HERE with Level, Name and Guild: 

http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5429 

First Prize is a "Black Acrylia Halberd" (40/48 2hs) provided by Rabine, Palamus and the KoHB. 

Second Prize is an "Arbitors Combine Greatsword" (30/43 2hs) provided by the KoHB. 

Third Prize is a Free "Soulifre" Walk-through. KoHB will provide everthing needed except for your own Testimony and Qeynos Faction. We will assist you in Paw and MQ the items for you. You pick the Paladin if you already have one. (No one below 30) 

We are hoping for assistance from The White Cross, Honor Knights, and Virtue Knights and Disciples of Honor (or any other Paladin like guild, send PM for details). If Sign ups are good and our guild friends can assist in the cost, First Prize may become a "Jeldorin" and a 4th prize added. 

Rules of Engagement: 

The Paladin Best of the Best competition hosted by the Knights of the Holy Blade and Friends is a test of "Paladin" skill and tactics. The choice of the words "Paladin Tactics" refers to honorable means of fighting. We seek the courageous who are not afraid to go "Toe to Toe". There is no running in circles avoiding blows. However, you may use all your spells, including blinding light and root. Rooting and bow kiting is authorized as well but you cannot be out of spell range. Strafing is allowed. Running is not. If you are outside of spell casting range, you are disqualified. If you step outside the PvP area, you are disqualified, if you receive heals from someone you are disqualified, if you continue to kill an opponent who calls "I conceit", you are disqualified. Read on... 

1. No Potions of any sort are allowed, ie sow, damage shield, invis etc. No right clickable damage shield/healing item is allowed to be used except for DW Helms. 

2. No items other than weapon and armor are allowed. ie special foods or drinks. Special Dwarven Food is not allowed. If you cant get it eating bread and water, then it doesnt exist here. 

3. Jousts are not to the death. Battles are for Honor!. We are not blood thirsty Warriors and Shadow Knights. The jousts are to "Conceit". The loosing opponent will /say "I conceit" to end a joust. 

a. If the loosing party calls "I Conceit", the battle is over &amp; the champion who did not call conceit wins. 

b. If neither opponent calls Conceit, then the battle is to the death based on the fact that no one calls conceit. We are gentlemen here, there is no need for death. Stubborness is allowed, however. 

c. If a attacker continues to attack someone that called conceit, the attacker looses. You are allowed a 2 second response time to stop attacking. If you continue attack past those 2 seconds, you loose, even though you were kickin some butt. 

4. ABSOLUTELY NO ASSISTANCE FROM ANY OUTSIDE SOURCE. You will be disqualified and disbanded from Event Channel. Any healing from anyone other than yourself will get you and the healer/assister disbanded, shunned and scoffed at and you will be posted as an unfriendly on our website. We don't like cheaters. 

5. No Lay Hands. Lay Hands is used in emergencies only. We never count on it when we fight (or shouldnt), so in the hopes of saving time, there will be no use of Lay Hands. 

6. Everyone will be completely debuffed and grouped with a judge and your opponent. The judge will witness spell casting and look for heals coming from outside sources. 

7. Have some honor. There are ways to cheat and we ask that you dont. You will not be forgotten for cheating. If you cant beat someone with what your God gave you, then you walk away knowing what you need improvement on. Nuff Said. Be a Paladin, virtuous, true and honorable. 

This will be a round robin tournament style event that will last 1-3 hours depending on sign ups. 3 pairs of combatants will assemble in the arena at one time based on level, each with a judge until one winner is chosen from each level. The champion of the 47-48 range will joust the champion of the 49-50 range and that Winner will joust the 51-52 champion. 

47-48 
49-50 
51-52 

Harbringer's Holy Ale will be served by our friendly Neighborhood Cleric, Saknussem! He will also be debuffing your arses prior to battle  

2 more judges from either the The White Cross, Honor Knights and Virtue Knights are needed. 

4-6 Level 60 Bouncers dressed in fine steel appearance (Warrior/Paladin/SK) are needed and will be paid in some fashion to keep the overzealous out of the Arena. (If you need fs armor, send pm) 

3-6 people are needed as crowd control in the crowds (/anon) to check for spells being cast, watching for people stepping into the arena, or items dropped in the arena, etc. 

All contestants will be posted here. A fee of 50 plat is charged for entrance. 

All contestants will put LFG on, Roleplaying/Anon OFF once they pay their fees and enter the spectators area. 

If we have a large number of sign ups, we will move the event to Lake Rathe or the Bazaar arena. 

The event will end with a Drunken (If you prefer) Xicotl and Grimrot slaying fest AT the Arena. Details at the event. The person with the Killing Blow recieves 500pp. 

May the Best Paladin Win!
