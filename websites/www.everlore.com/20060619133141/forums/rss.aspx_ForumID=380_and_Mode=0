Azeral. That's right. I'm an epic quest now. If you're lucky enough to find me and get me as a quest, and then complete me, I might let you wield me. Maybe. If you've got the level limit. Now, many of you might be saying to yourself, "Why, I was told that Azeral was a bugged item and I just bought him for $100 on Ebay!" I regret to inform you that there are no refunds, and that Verant claims to be investigating the Azeral or two that popped up before the official quest was implemented. Those of you found to be trafficking or in possession of bugged Azeral will face account suspension, banning, or drive-by shootings. The quest is said to be found deep in the heart of Solusek, so keep your eyes peeled. There's also going to be a GM event soon to reveal a few clues as to how to complete Azeral, but no exact time has been told to me. Thank you, and enjoy.
