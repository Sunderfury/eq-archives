nothing against all you warriors out there but i find it extreemly boring to play warriors.
and mayby its just me but i don't really see many advantages that they have other then high defence.

P.S. this is not meant to effend anyone. i just want positive input on you warriors

For example, I know that Dark Elves start out with Hide at 50 and have Ultra Vision, but they're an evil race.  Dwarves start with Sense Direction at 50, +5 to PR and MR, but have no disadvantages (unless you include being small a disadvantage).  I'd like to know what all the other races' advantages and disadvantages are...</description></item><item><title>QUESTION ON HIGHER LVL WEAPONS</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1098331/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2004 10:14:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1098331</guid><dc:creator /><slash:comments>8</slash:comments><description>WHAT DOES THE RECOMMENDED LVL MEAN.

I have been practicing my kick on low level creatures, and it doesn't seem to be improving.  Any help you can offer is great!

An example of what I am looking for is:

Is it worth raising a stat from 70 to 75.

Does each point raised help, such as from 93 to 94, or are there breaks in where the effect is heightened, such as every 10 points or so?

Thanks for any help and guidance, this will be my first character and I would like to create him right from the start.</description></item><item><title>Blue line under Level meter</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1098315/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2003 19:02:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1098315</guid><dc:creator>Evilbob</dc:creator><slash:comments>9</slash:comments><description>I have been playing now for a while and just recently I have noticed this blue meter under my next level meter. I never really paid much attention to it, but I have been playing more recently and i can figure out whta it is used for. It spells seem to not have any effect on how long it is, and I dont think that it has anything to do with my skills. Anyone know what this is for?</description></item><item><title>LDoN Skills</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1098311/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2003 15:11:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1098311</guid><dc:creator>Grizelle1</dc:creator><slash:comments>4</slash:comments><description>Can anyone tell me where to find the new skill caps for chars now that LDoN is out?

Now I am level 36 and realize that I should have been training with my 2Hand slashing skill as well as my 1 hand and shield. BUT I DID NOT.  So now that I realize the error of my ways, what do I do. Please don't tell me to start all over unless this is the only alternative. The Question is how can I bring up my 2handed slashing skill now that I am level 36.</description></item><item><title>Flag Quests</title><link>http://everlore.com/forums/1098297/ShowPost.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2003 20:46:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">79aa39b1-e221-4f61-ad6a-df0187164fbf:1098297</guid><dc:creator>bobsucks</dc:creator><slash:comments>1</slash:comments><description>Alright I need some help...

I was wondering what anyone would suggest for me. I LOVE being main tank, but also LOVE to buff and heal. And not to sound lazy, but also, the less I have to do the better, (kinda an oxymoron to everything I just said huh! lol). Also, I prefer being in a group to going solo. Oh ya, also love having a pet. This is not a necessary thing, but much loved. That's all I can think of...Let me know what you think! ThanX a grip! Have a super day! Many blessings in the form of few deaths and much leveling!

See ya round (if on Zeb server)...=D
