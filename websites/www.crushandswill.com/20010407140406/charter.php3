Verified incidences of this type of behavior will be grounds for immediate expullsion from the guild. Any incidence of this type of behavior by a guild member should be brought to the attention of an officer. The incident will be reviewed, and actions will be taken based on the officers discoveries. The officer has absolute authority. If you find yourself the victim of these types of actions by players not in the guild, do not "Return the favor". Contact a guide or GM and lodge a formal complaint as these actions are in violation of the "Play Nice" rules.

<td><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Guild Spamming. The Book of Crush defines spamming as repeated messages to the guild channel, not related to a conversation or as an attempt at beginning a conversation. This includes, but is not limited to, Begging, buying or selling items and asking for help. Do not misread this rule: Crush and Swill is all about helping it's members. Asking for help is fine, and perfectly acceptible, as are offering to buy or sell an item, however, repeating requests or offers of this type to the point that it disrupts regular guild communications, is frowned upon, and generally upsets the other guild members. If you ask for help or offer an item for sale and nobody responds, it is generally because they are not able to help you or are not interested in buying your item, and repeating your request or offer is unlikely to change this.

<td><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Recruitment. Crush and Swill Company is now a "By Recommendation" only membership guild. This means that no one will be tagged simply because they want to join the guild. Any player wishing to become a member must first find a "Sponsor". Any current regular member of the guild may be a sponsor. Once a sponsor has been found, the Sponsor must contact an officer and make his sponsor status known. All information on the player is to be posted on the application and membership message board, by the sponsor. The potential member must play or group with the Sponsor and the sponsor will determine if the player is Crush and Swill material. At such time that the Sponsor deems the player ready for membership, he will submit the players name to an officer along with the reasons he thinks the player is Crush and Swill material. The officer will then conduct a brief interview with the player and make a determination on the players "Crush-Swill-iness". If the player is deemed acceptible, he/she is tagged and placed on a probationary  "Lil Crusher" status for 2 weeks. DURING THESE 2 WEEKS, THE PLAYER MAY BE DROPPED FOR ANY REASON. After the 2 week probationary period, the player is promoted to regular member status, and a welcome is posted to the applications and membership message board. SPONSORS SHALL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THEIR SPONSOREDS!!!
