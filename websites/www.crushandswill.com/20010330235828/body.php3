<p><font face='Arial,Helvetica'>Hey all! I had a brain lapse last week and didn't post the results of our guild meeting for everyone to see, so here goes: <BR><BR> 1. New officers are going to be appointed. I want around FIVE new officers who are very visible to our members (online a lot) and willing to spend time helping the guild. To volunteer or nominate someone, please email me directly (click my name on the roster). <BR> 2. Recruitment of new members will be put on hold for the most part until current members are acquainted with each other once again. I hate seeing people log on that I've never heard of, as I'm sure many of you do as well. <BR> 3. Any members that haven't personally had their butts whooped by me in the arena since they joined MUST show up at the Arena for this week's guild bash (6PM EST). Also I want everyone, even old-timers, if humanly possible to be there this week for bashing of the lil-crushers and a general morale boosting, drunken festival of carnage the Crush and Swill Way!!!<BR><BR> Tanks, <BR> Rig </font></td>

The first thing we need to concentrate on is getting the clerics their epics, after a bad pull when 30 people die you have no better friend than a cleric with a rez stick ;).

<p><font face='Arial,Helvetica'>First off I would like to apologize for the mass death today, it was my fault. I didn't remember to tell everyone to camp out after they zoned in. Everyone did a great job today, would have been a nearly perfect raid except for that. This was the first raid I've been on where all the loot mobs went down, I'm proud of you guys. Tomorrow will be tougher, everything will be up so it's going to be pretty steady killing. You have to stay focused and disciplined, keep the camp tight and we'll have no problems. Tomorrow (Monday) I want to start at 4 EST if possible, I will start a chat room, password swill again. If we have enough we go in and clear to portal, if not we try again at 5. One last bitch about loot: Only group leaders check mobs, after rolls I will anounce winner, if you don't see me call your name don't loot. If you're unsure ask, also all items go to me to pay people back for peridots and other reagents. </font></td>

<p><font face='Arial,Helvetica'>I wanted to tell everyone how very sorry I am for not being able to continue to lead the guild. You are all wonderful and the time I have spend with you all has been great. Several issues have been taxes my mind as of late. The foremost is Vis Major's terrible lack of respect for others. They have Attempted to Ks gods from people and turned the server into a place I don't want to call home anymore. I am deleting my character and I am through. I will not stand for their actions or the actions of any other said Uber guild. Might does NOT make right. The selfish actions they have displayed cause me to give up that which I have enjoyed for almost 2 years. I would call out to you all to do the same if I thought I had a chance to break your addiction, but I am sure that would be in Vain. Goodbye to you all. </font></td>

The new version is much faster and has many additional features that I hope to take advantage of in the near future. The php documentation claims that php 4 is 99.9% backwards compatible with php 3, but there are some obscure commands that have either been changed or removed in php 4. <BR>WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU: The version change will take no more than 15 mins, BUT there may be things that turn up broken. If you find anything broken, please report it to me at Bertog@crushandswill.com and keep your fingers crossed. With any luck, the upgrade will happen without incident :) </font></td>

<p><font face='Arial,Helvetica'>Ordoc is moving and unavailable and Hraakka has been MIA the last few days so it looks like I'm in charge of the circus. I would like to get as many people as possible into the North camp in Fear Saturday night so we can kill the roamers a little easier and not have to break in from scratch. I will get in touch with the raid leader that is there now and ask him to let us know when portal is clear so we can zone in and camp out at NC. I think Oogobuk is going to help us pull still so we should have no problems, with as many people as we'll have Fear is cake with a good pull team. The raid will start at noon EST on Sunday and 6 EST Monday and Tuesday, I will have a chat room set up 30mins before the raid is supposed to start each day. The room will be called "C&SFear" and password will be "fear" because I don't think "How the hell did I get stuck with this?!!!!" will fit in the space available =p. I will be on lots the next couple days spamming guildchat with info and answering any questions you have. I have spent a full week in Fear now and I know how to run the camp, when I ask you to do something please trust that I know what I'm talking about and it's important that you do it. I know that if we stay organized we can own the zone no problem and not leave any loot behind because we run out of time. See you all there =). </font></td>

<p><font face='Arial,Helvetica'>I have finally gotten the server status script up and running! You will notice the status of the Quellious server right under the C&S logo. It runs really well, but I'm not sure I have *completely* figured out the UDP data that the status server sends out. If you see anything weird up there, like showing Quellious to be up when there are 0 players and 101 zones down, let me know. Also, if you see 'Quellious is 02' or 'Quellious is 03', let me know. The actual status flags are what I am having the most problems with. There are more flags than just 'up' or 'down', but I'm not sure what they are and just have numbers assigned to them for right now (hence the 02 and 03). Anyway, just another little feature I felt like adding.<BR> A real point of pride for me is that I'm not using any application backend, like most of the EQ sites do. Eqvault, for instance, uses a modified version of EQ Serverscan, which they PAID for. This one is all script. I am decoding the raw UDP packets, and my script seems to be faster than both Evermon and EQ Serverscan. I suspect this is because they may be caching the udp info. Either way, I am pretty darn proud of myself, lol. To see the full script, click the Server Status link on the left. </font></td>
