<p> The light was shining from the east eluminating the desert for what promised to be another scorching day of intense heat and endless warfare. Sitting on the edge of a pier in a place known as The Oasis of Marr, Jeneth Silverlight, a High Elf Paladin of 23 seasons, wondered how things in her life had changed from the simple following of Tunare, Mother of all, to the complex and curiously wonderful distortion of reality she now was feeling. Since childhood, she had been taught the ways of the Paladin, to follow the path of goodness and light, but lately she had begun to question the teachings of her youth. The object of her wonder, was a Shadow Knight. The kind of being she had been taught to loathe and despise since childhood. Try as she might. she could not rid her mind of thoughts of him. He consumed her waking hours and haunted her dreams at night. He was ever present yet always distant. She was angry with herself and ashamed of the way she felt. Having recently been accepted into one of the most noble guilds in Norrath, the Guardian Knights, she thought of herself as a traitor to her guild and to her teachings.    </p>
<p>Sitting on the dock, trying to regain her strength from her last battle, Jeneth thought back to the events that led to her present torment. When still in her 22nd season, it happened that she was engaged in a particularly dangerous encounter with a "deep water crocodile" when a "dry bones skeleton", seeing an easy mark, entered the fray on the side of the croc. Having already used "lay hands" in a previous fight, she was fair game for the two enemies. As they were preparing to carve her up into slivers, she herd a war cry from nearby. It was the voice of a Human Shadow Knight who was coming to her rescue. Faced with the dilemma of accepting his help, or certain death, she chose the former. He waded into battle as though his heart was on fire. slashing away at the crocodile and his own brethren with a fury she had seldom seen before. Exhausted, and totally spent, but very glad to be alive, she thanked him for saving her life. He was very courteous and said it was his pleasure to assist in her fight and was very happy she survived. </p>

<p>With warnings from childhood ringing in her ears, she engaged him in conversation. "Thank you, Sir", she said, "you have saved me from certain death". "My pleasure, M'Lady, I am very happy to be of service.", he said. Jeneth said "I see you are a Shadow Knight and a follower of darkness, we are fore sworn to be against each other, yet I find my self beholden to you, Sir.". Jeneth was deeply perplexed, wondering why, a Shadow Knight, should behave in such a manner.. He answered with words like woven silver as he said "You are the judge of my actions, M'Lady, only you can say if I acted with nobility or not". </p>

<p>"You are most kind, Sir and I will not forget your kindness. If ever you have need of me I am at your service, despite our differences" Jeneth said. "We have no differences, on my part, M'Lady, I simply sought to assist you in your time of distress", said he. Damn his silver tongue she thought. He was getting under her skin and she didn't like it. "I assure you, Sir that I have been warned, since I was very young, to beware of your kind. It is true, you have saved my life, but the day will come when I will repay you in kind. I do not like owing a debt to one such as you" said Jeneth. She winced as she said it, he had acted with kindness and she was saying things to hurt him, but she had to protect herself.</p>

<p>Confused by her feelings, and wanting to repay him for his kindness, Jeneth decided to help him. "Sir, as partial payment for my debt to you, I will stay with you and give you my assistance until such time as whatever gods you worship, grant you the boon of another season" Jeneth said. With his, by now, expected eloquence, he replied "My dear Lady, it is not necessary for you to assist me. I assure you, you have no debt to me. If however, you decide to adventure with me, I will be both honored and delighted". Why did he have to be so damn nice.</p>

<p>"The debt is mine, Sir and I shall repay it", she said. She then persuaded him to engage foes which he would normally have very little chance of vanquishing by himself. He was a Shadow Knight of only 14 seasons and some of the desert foes where very dangerous to him. The casting of Holy Armor upon him was extremely ironic considering his unholy nature but, Jeneth did not care what others thought of her helping a Shadow Knight, she had a debt of honor to pay.</p> 

<p>Before long, thanks to Jeneth's help, his gods granted him his 15th season. Upon hearing this news, Jeneth congratulated him and said she must now travel to the town of Freeport as she had important business there. He asked her if he could escort her on her journey, since she had been so good to him. By now she had violated all her teachings, what diference one more. To be seen aiding a Shadow Knight and now traveling with him made her feel like a traitor. Yet, it was becoming easier to converse with him and she was beginning to like him very much. She accepted his offer and off they went to Freeport.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Freeport bank, Jeneth thanked him for being her companion and assured him she would not forget her debt. She knew that if she followed his progress, surely a time would come when she could save his life and have no more to do with him and place herself back in Tunare's grace. "Stop", he said, "don't leave yet". Jeneth wondered, "know what does he want. how can I rid myself of him". He said "I have something to give you", at which time he presented her with a sword named "Drakkel Icereaver". Jeneth had never seen such a weapon. It was a magic two handed sword that was extremely damaging and produced the "Ice Rend" spell while in battle. She knew she should not accept it. She knew she should run from him, but the worst things have ways of happening at the least expected times. She was becoming enamored of him and happily accepted the sword. She wanted to pay him for it, knowing she didn't have even a tenth of it's value in her possession. She offered to pay him as she adventured more and gained more wealth. He would have none of this talk. He assured her in his very sweet and kind way that it was his pleasure to give it to her and thanked her again for all her help.</p>

<p>They parted company at this time as each had other pressing matters to attend to. Jeneth promised she would adventure with him again. A promise she intended to keep regardless of her teachings. In fact, by this time she thought all the things she had been taught might not be completely true.</p>

<p>Sitting on the dock this desert morning, Jeneth was no longer wondering about what was right and wrong, or which teaching was correct. She no longer cared. She was falling in love.</p>
