<font size="+3">Chapter 6:  Freeport</font>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Ravell approached the desert city of Freeport with the two high elves.  He had his doubts about being allowed into the city, but Garit had assured him that while dark elves were not exactly welcome, they were not to be killed either.  This made Ravell a little more uneasy.  If dark elves were tolerated in this city then either the people were overly trusting or something was more than it seemed.  Ravell noted that the guards and inhabitants didn't seem to be very trusting people.</p>
<p>Inside town, stone walls cornered around buildings seemingly placed at random.  There were not paved streets, just more desert sand.  The desert heat was not quite as bad in the city, and there were even sparse patches of grass and a tree here or there.  Even with the sun about to set, the heat of the desert flared.  Garit purposely steered the group around all of the major buildings, knowing that while the guards and authority in Freeport might allow drow in their city, some of the inhabitants would certainly not react well to the appearance of a dark elf.  They finally made it to an inn in northern Freeport near the city bank.  The inn's walls were all painted a jade green color, and the carpet was nice as well.  Garit approached the innkeep and laid down some platinum.</p>
<p>"Do you have three rooms, innkeep?" Garit inquired.</p>
<p>"You kidding? Didn't you know about the festival going on? Our rooms are packed, elf.  We've got one vacancy left." The innkeep replied.</p>
<p>Garit frowned slightly. "Very well, then. We'll take the one room."</p>
<p>The innkeeper handed Garit a key, directed them towards the third floor, and walked off to a back room.  Garit, Lenia, and Ravell found the room without any trouble, and went in.  Two small beds lay on opposite sides of the room, with a dresser in between. The only other thing in the room was a rug.  The trio sat down on the carpet and relaxed.</p>
<p> "I let you talk me into too much, sister.  First Befallen and then going back to Freeport for the night." Garit laid his helmet and sword on the dresser.</p>
<p>Lenia smiled. "Well if we hadn't gone to Befallen then we wouldn't have had such an adventure.  Perhaps we'll have one in Freeport as well."</p>
<p>Garit began cleaning his sword.  "Freeport's adventures tend to be more serious than a few drow in some ruins.  There's an evil man who runs most of this city, and I'd rather stay out of his sights.  To that end, we need to stay inside tonight and get out of here quickly tomorrow."</p>
<p>Lenia's stubborness had not been left behind with the other arguement. "Brother, you may stay in and then you can stay out of his sights, but Ravell and I are going outside.  Staying inside all night is not what I came back to Freeport for!"</p>
<p>"Alright but try to keep a low profile.  Do <i>not</i> wander too far in this city or you may find its underbelly.  I don't want to have to dig you out of a mess tonight." Garit decided his sword was as clean as possible and laid it back town on the dresser.  He then turned his attention to his blood-splattered helmet.</p>
<p>Lenia smiled at her third victory in a row. "Come on Ravell, let's go find out what this festival is about."</p>
<p>Garit grabbed Ravell and whispered to him.  "Young drow, do not enter any buildings in the city.  The guards may be open enough towards your kind but the people inside the city are not.  Be wary."</p>
<p>Ravell nodded and then left the room with Lenia.  "A festival?" He thought to himself. "Perhaps it'll be like that public torture Lord N'Vitar performed on that guard who crossed him.  Or worse.  Who knows what these people are capable of."</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Ravell was surprised to see singing, dancing, free ale and food.  He was just beginning to wonder where the torture was going to take place when he realized that all this must be the 'festival'.  He stood warily next to a tent and watched the wooden stage ahead of him. </p>
<p>A group of bards stood on stage in costumes.  They put on a magnificent play first, and then began to play a great many ballads, read many poems, and dance.  Ravell thought it was all quite silly, and that humans must have been quite mad, but after awhile he stood smiling and thoroughly enjoying himself.  Cake was handed around along with various types of liquor.  At the end of the show there was even a gnome who set off some strange invention he called 'fireworks'.  The night sky was dark enough to make the fireworks especially wondrous.</p>
<p>Ravell glanced over at Lenia and noticed she was looking at him.  "What?" He asked, suddenly feeling embarrassed without knowing why.</p>
<p>"Sorry.  I've just never been so close to a drow before.  It seems a little unreal." She replied, smiling back.</p>
<p>Ravell turned his attention to the exploding lights in the sky.  "It's unreal for me too, you know.  Just yesterday I was a respected member of Neriak, today I am a traitor."</p>
<p>Lenia detected some sorrow in Ravell's voice.  "Tell me about your hometown."</p>
<p>"Well," Ravell sighed.  "Neriak was, above everything else, a gorgeous city.  Faerie fires burned around the city in mystic symbols.  Stone walls enclosed the city.  I remember a favorite pub of mine most of all.  I never seemed to have enough spare change to buy more than a single drink, but the atmosphere was nice.  The pub was built with glass windows looking out into an underground lake, and I would often sit back and watch as fish swam by.  The place was quiet, seldom visited by many people, and I liked that.  I could sit back and collect my thoughts."</p>
<p>Lenia looked at Ravell thoughtfully.  "I know you miss it, but please believe me when I tell you that you made the right choice."</p>
<p>Ravell stared back directly at Lenia.  "I know I made the right choice.  It just still feels wrong."</p>
<p>Lenia knew what was holding him back.  "It's that shadowknight.  You still care for her."</p>
<p>Ravell nodded.  "I suppose I do.  She was a better friend to me than anyone else, and I had to turn my back on her world and her ways.  I don't want to be her enemy..."</p>
<p>Lenia put her arm around Ravell's shoulders.  "It's pretty late.  We should go back to the room."</p>
<p>Ravell's response was hesitant, making it clear he was still thinking about his home.  "Alright."</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Strange symbols glowed all around on black marble walls.  Pillars rose some fifty feet before meeting with the ceiling.  Strange swords bearing arcane auras hung from a far wall.  A large training area spread out with a single drow female in black armor practicing her swordplay.  Her new two-handed sword made hazy purple arcs as she swung it around.</p>
<p> "Now!" Lilith ordered.</p>
<p> A group of undead entered the room, and Lilith grinned underneath her black helmet.  The skeletons all charged at her, and Lilith could only grin back at them arrogantly.  When they were within range, she struck out like a black bolt of lightning.  Green auras encompassed many of the skeletons which decayed immediately and fell to the floor in a pile of rotting bone.  The skeletons which didn't die by her spells fell by her precise strikes with her blade, and within seconds the entire undead horde had been slaughtered.</p>
<p>Tossing her helmet aside, Lilith concentrated her power on her sword, which pulsed it's dark purple light around the room.  A chilling wind picked up and a huge purple bolt shot forth from the blade, finding it's target on the far end of the room.  As the dust settled, Lilith could be seen clearly still in her same stance.  Across the room a large crater filled the place where a smooth concrete wall had just been.</p>
<p>Lilith's grin widened as she surveyed her damage.  Her voice contorted in absolute hatred as she murmured, "Ravell...".</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Lenia and Ravell returned to an empty room.  Ravell checked the doors next to him to be sure they were in the right one, and was greeted by the shrieks of women and the threats of men.  Entering his room again, he noticed Lenia was holding a note.</p>
<p>"What does it say?" He asked.</p>
<p>Lenia frowned.  "Dear sister, thinking upon the events today, I have decided that your spirit craves adventures that I cannot provide to you as of yet.  I must get this half-elven child to its destination and find what happened to our brother before the trail has gone cold.  I hope you understand that I had to leave you, because while you wanted to see the world, you also want to explore everything in it and I do not have the time for such adventures.  I know I have not left you in bad company, you and the drow should be able to handle any tasks so long as you keep your wits about you.  I shall find you again someday, perhaps after you've seen what you could of the world.  Your loving brother, -Garit."</p>
<p>Ravell joined Lenia in frowning.  "Perhaps we would be better off with a night's rest to digest this.  We can plan our course of action tomorrow, yes?"</p>
<p>Lenia sighed and folded the note up, tucking it away in her traveling bag.  "That seems like a good plan, I'm too tired to sort this out right now."</p>
<p>The two elves, light and dark, lay at either end of the room in their seperate little beds.  Ravell found himself unable to sleep, so he watched the ceiling and contemplated everything that had happened in the long day.  He had gone from a respected leader of an elite team to an outcast so quickly he still couldn't entirely grasp what happened.  He hoped Lilith would be able to forget about him.  She probably thought of him as dead already, he told himself.  Hours passed, and after awhile Ravell finally collapsed into a much needed slumber.</p>
