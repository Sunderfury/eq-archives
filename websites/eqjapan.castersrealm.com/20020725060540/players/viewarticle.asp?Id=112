<b>Chapter One<br></b><i>A Sorcerer. A Naked Man. Voices.</i><p></center>
          The aroma of charred vegetation filled the valley, as a smokey haze of death hovered about the floor before the tall onyx black tower, pierced with large holes where bolts had shot out from moments before.  Coming from a tree, a large ball of roaring fire shot towards the tower, only to have it dissipate on it's cool black surface.  Even under the barrage of black bolts the tower had faced, it still stood majestically tall and proud, in a sinister way.<p>
     Barnok, the gnoll commander and perhaps now leader, barked into the forests where the fire ball had came.  He stood tall and proud, armored in a dark plated chest plate, with steel leggings that were made for his kind.  Withdrawing a large blade from his side, he barked with rage again.  This time, he received a reply.  As he stood, roots from the ground began to grow and twist about his legs, the gnoll howled with rage and hacked at the growing roots.  Yet, to no avail as they were far too strong for him to cut with a normal blade.<p>
     He growled at the form emerging from behind a tree, unable to move.  An erudite man walked slowly from his once hiding spot, wearing a hooded crimson robe, with a yellow robe beneath it, tied off with a royal blue sash.  He appeared to be old, in erudite standards, but did not seem to be hampered by his old age.  As he made his way towards the tower, he eyed it suspiciously from under his hood then turned his gaze to the gnoll.<p>						
     "Is this your tower?" The erudite asked the gnoll in it's own language as his voice rang with authority.<p>
     In reply, a growl.  The man shrugged and turned back to the tower turning his head up to it's heights.  As he stepped up next to it, he placed his left hand slowly upon it's surface.  As he touched it, his hand began to freeze.  Gasping in surprise, the man pulled away, leaving small strands of his flesh upon the tower.<p>
     "E'ci be cursed!" cried the man, as he took a few paces back eyeing it again.<p>
     As he was retreating his steps, a naked man, a human, stepped out from the tower.  Using no door.  As the erudite had just noticed no doors on the tower existed.  At first glance, one would think the man to be sick as his skin and eyes were sunken in.  Yet, about his head was healthy looking silver hair that reached down to his mid back and cascaded over his shoulders.  Eyeing the naked man ,who stood still at the sight of the other.  Both of their eye's locked.  It was the naked man who began to chuckle, his deep, dark, sinister chuckle.<p>
     "Is this your tower?" inquired the erudite.<p>
     The naked man turned and looked up to it's peak and then returned his gaze upon the robed erudite.  "Yes, this is my castle.  As it has been long before your birth, child."<p>
     At the note of child, the erudite seemed stunned.  He did not look like any child, and his rank was far higher than any <i> child</i>.  Furious by the title, the erudite wove a quick spell and called a staff into being, as he held it at his side glaring at the naked human.  However, this human was seemed to be better built and a tad taller than most humans that existed in Norrath.  Even among his pale looking features.<p>
     "Do you know who I am,<i>young man</i> ?"  The robed figure began to stand taller, as if he was more important than that of any child.<p>
     "No, I do not, nor do I care," at that, the naked man began to turn and walk over to Barnok and spoke over his shoulder, "I do not care for the names of those soon to die."<p>
     Utterly stunned by this comment, the robed man began to weave a spell, making lavish gestures as if to  proclaimed himself, sending a bright light about the area.<p>
     "I am Al'Kabor, Grand High Sorcerer of Erudin.  You have been charged with destruction of our forests and will be taken to our courts at once," as he spoke in formal tongue and tone, he looked at the tower, "and you're tower will be destroyed as well."<p>
     Paying no attention to what the <i>sorcerer</i> behind him was stating, he reached Barnok.  Giving him a gentle smile, the gnoll growled.<p>
     "I am the man within the crystal, Barnok, your aid to me was and is highly valued and you have remained true through it all, you are welcome to come with me, at my side," the man spoke, his voice cruel and deep, not the voice of a mortal, nor a smiling man.<p>
     Barnok took in a deep breath, a breath of complete shock.  He had heard the crystal say that there was a body within, but never did he think it was actually true!  The gnoll's mind raced, as he watched the naked man speak a word and the roots at his feat receded back into the ground.  The erudite growled and began to speak an incantation.<p>
     Barnok took a knee before the human, and lowered his head.  Thrusting his sword into the ground, he recited the oath the gnoll's gave their leaders.  It commanded their lives be given to their leaders as the only desired form of their death, and that they should fall before their leader, if the situation permits.  As he lifted his head, he saw the smiling man a moment before a torrent of fire engulfed him.  Gasping, Barnok howled at the sight.  Was his master dead already?<p>
     As the flames died down, the form of the human remained, untouched.  Slowly, the man turned, his eyes ablaze.<p>
     "Fool!  Is that your highest art?  Is that the art of the <i>grand high sorcerer</i> ?"  His voiced boomed throughout the valley, as the muscles on the man pulsed, as energy seemed to be raging inside him.<p>
     Hiding the surprise from his face from the insult, Al'Kabor began to recite yet another spell.  Fishing deep within his mind for a spell which would eliminate this ostentatious foe.  His hands moved as he let words roll out of his mouth, words many within the realms did not know existed and even more that could not comprehend them.  The naked man, just stood there, eyes ablaze and silver hair riding in the wind.<p>
     "I shall bring the judgment of the council upon you now!" growled out the sorcerer.<p>
     Around Al's hands, a rift began to open, as it opened thunder roared, green and blue hazes mixed within the hole as the sorcerer continued the spell.  With the last uttered words, the rift shot in a swerving ball towards the human, who just waited. As the ball hit, it sent a huge shockwave throughout the treeless, smokey valley.  The air itself screamed in torment as it cleared the entire area of smoke, and caused Barnok to fly backwards with blood flowing from his ears.  <p>
     The human was knocked back three steps, with his arms flailing slightly, but within a moment he stood again with full composure.  Only a slight bruise where the ball of shifting worlds had hit remained.  Another laugh filled the valley air, that same laugh that sent chills down one's spine.<p>
     "An ethereal call, now that is a spell worthy of a high sorcerer, among mortal men," spoke the human as his laughing subsided.<p>
     Al'Kabor stared in complete shock at the man before him, <i>alive!</i> The Ethereal Calling was the realms most known powerful spell, and it just left a bruise upon the man, and a naked man without any form of protection at that!  His body ached and burned from using such a powerful spell, and he was now in worse condition than his opponent.  Al's mind raced, it swam within a flood of questions, answers, and what was happening.  Yet, one question rose to the surface within the flood, and he asked it.<p>
     "Who are you?"  Spoke a tired, sweat drenched sorcerer.<p>
     A grin, befit for Innoruuk himself, spread across the human's lips.  His hands reached low, and he began to lift his arms into the air, taking himself along with them.  As he glided straight up into the air, flames licked up from the earth, twisting about him.  Swirling this way and that, covering him and bathing him.  Yet, his eyes seemed to burn brighter than the flames which surrounded his form floating with arms outstretched towards the sky.<p>
     "I, Al'Kabor, am Serivok Diz'Urian.  Created Guardian of Norrath, and now I will reclaim what was stripped from me!"  His voice sounded of thunder, roaring into the night air, and boomed upon the last statement.<p>
     At that moment, Serivok, the naked human bathed in fire, began an incantation of his own.  It seemed to only take seconds, but what followed was of power none should ever wield, and Al knew it.  The skies lite aflame, as crimson roaring fire fell in front of Serivok.  The heavens shook violently as the fire continued to be called forth from the sky, until it began to take shape of a huge giant looking beast.  It roared with rage, slashing at the air about it leaving streaks of screaming air in it's wake.<p>
     "May you pray to Ro, that you're devotion to him is up to par with his normal priestly standards," growled out Serivok, "and if they are not, I suggest you run."  As a laugh once again rang out.<p>
     Al gasped, as he looked upon an fiery elemental looking beast that stood taller than the tower they were next too.  Gulping hard, he cried out prayers to his many magical gods.  The fiery beast turned it's sulfur eyes upon him and charged.  His hands began to weave a quick spell.  As fire leapt from the beasts hands, burning hot as it gushed towards Al'Kabor, Grand High Sorcerer. <p>
     A moment before the fiery gush of death hit him, a shimmering globe went about him, as the fire washed harmlessly over it allowing the sorcerer to finish his spell.  Disappearing beneath the protective globe.<p>
     Serivok spun around in the air, as the giant fiery form charged off in the direction of where his target had gated to, Erudin.  As a man's scream filled the air about a hundred yards away.  Serivok gasped.<p>

<b>Chapter Two</b><br><i>Simonic. Dorson. Sekerv.</i></center><p>
     <i>"You have invoked the power which had been ordained that you not call upon,"</i>  rung a deep mental voice within Simonic's head.<p>
     <i>"The realms needed it."</i> protested himself.<p>
     <i>"Speak thus to the Tribune."<p></i>
     Pain shot through his body being tugged by an unseen force, as he screamed out into the night.  Before his body was sucked from land's of Norrath.  Leaving a scared Dorson staring at where his friend was just a second before.  As Dorson turned his gaze back towards the man, Serivok, he felt fiery eye's pierce through him.  He was enthralled.<p>
