                 <u>By Tarendor</u> 


<p>Midday. The sun shines bright and fierce down upon the docks of Erudin. Gulls scream their joys and sorrows into the stiff wind as they comb the waterfront, looking for whatever food they can find from the refuse of others. I sit at the water's edge in one of my favourite spots, just beneath the high wall which runs along the causeway in front of the port authority. The gentle motion of the water here calms me, brings a serenity that is increasingly difficult to find these days.</p>

<p>The docks team with the life expected from any busy port. The regular arrivals of ships from Qeynos bring with them an inexhaustible mix of people of all races and professions. All seeking their own ends, their own pursuits and goals. Not all of them wholesome by any means, but Erudin IS one of the greatest sources of mystical knowledge in the world, and so this is to be expected.</p>

<p>None of this concerns me, however. Even the arrival of a Dark Elf Necromancer, magically disguised as a Dwarf from Kaladim on the last ship, does not overly bother me(if he makes trouble, then he shall face the justice of the GateCallers). I have other problems of my own. Not the least of which is how I should continue to tell my story. In the end, I wonder if it will matter, or who will read this. Still, I must go on. This tale must be told?</p>

<p>At the end of my apprenticeship within the Tower of the GateCallers, I was called by Markus Jaevins into his study for a private meeting. It was two days before my leaving and I was anxious to be away from the Erudin palace?it would be my first time in two years.</p>

<p>I had never actually been to Markus' study before. Not many students were ever allowed into the Guildmaster's private sanctum. I was both intrigued and apprehensive at the thought.</p>

<p>I didn't think I was in trouble, after my last meeting with Kidrian Lenitar two years earlier, I had lost most of my juvenile rebelliousness. I had thrown myself into my studies with everything I had and Markus had been there every step of the way, ensuring that I pushed myself beyond whatever limits I imagined I had. I could never quite make up my mind as to if I was grateful to Kidrian or not for asking the Guildmaster to personally train me in the GateCaller's art, but that was past me now. In two days I would be an official GateCaller, a magician in my own right.</p>

<p>The study was everything I had not expected, and as I knocked and entered the room, I looked about me in surprise. Though large enough, it  was almost bare! No paintings or adornments on the walls. No artifacts, magical or otherwise from what I could see were on any of the crafted wooden shelves which sat in the corners of the room. The entire room gave the feeling of being sterile and uninhabited. Only the Guildmaster's desk showed any signs of life, having several scrolls, pens and official-looking documents strewn about it. A large, iron chandelier hung from the ceiling, with several lit candles giving light to the room which had no windows. The chandelier was the ugliest I had ever seen, resembling a large claw(complete with sharp spikes) reaching down into the room to claim unwanted guests, but it served its purpose.</p>

<p>'Not what you were expecting, young Tarendor?' Markus regarded me amusedly from behind his desk.</p>

<p>'I'm not sure WHAT I was expecting, Guildmaster. Or why you called me here.' My expression must have made my confusion and nervousness apparent.</p>

<p>'You're not here for a reprimand, young one. Or indeed because of any misdeed on your part. Quite the opposite really.' As he spoke, he stood and walked around the desk, his eyes on mine the whole time. I wanted to look away, but I found myself unable to.</p>

<p>'What is it then, Guildmaster?'</p>

<p>'When the priest, Lenitar, asked me to train you myself two years ago, I also asked something of him. If I was to train you as my personal student, then I would be allowed to test you as I saw fit. He agreed.' Markus folded his arms over his chest and continued to look at me. His dark eyes piercing.</p>

<p>Though I had spent the last two years with him, I realized in that moment how little I really knew him. He rarely spoke about anything other than the art which he taught me, and never questioned me about my own personal affairs, though I had the distinct impression that he knew more about me than even I did.</p>

<p>In fact, his whole bearing suggested that he knew all there was to know about, well, everything(although I'm sure someone like Al'Kabor would vehemently disagree).</p>

<p>His physical appearance belied his power. This I knew for sure. He was frail in stature, even for an Erudite spellcaster. And his face was oddly nondescript, leaving one grasping for anything to say about it which would distinguish him in a crowd. He was neither ugly nor handsome, a truly ordinary-looking man, save for his being rather thin as I mentioned before.</p>

<p>'Guildmaster, I have been through the final tests for my title of GateCaller. What more is there?' I was, if anything, even more nervous now.</p>

<p>'You have not been through MY test. And that is what matters now. I will not name you GateCaller until you have satisfied ME by taking it.'</p>

<p>'As you see fit Guildmaster.' I really just wanted to get whatever it was over with. Which is why I was totally unprepared for what happened next.</p>

<p>'The title of GateCaller is yours, young Tarendor. All you must do, is survive THIS.'</p>

<p>As he spoke, a pale blue energy began to suffuse his form, spreading out from around him and then rising toward the ceiling with a crackling hiss. Then, in an instant, he was gone and something else stepped out of the fading glow of his Gate spell.</p>

<p>The creature wasn't as short as it appeared, though it wasn't quite as tall as a man. Rather, it moved stooped over and used its arms to help pull it along. Covered with short, brown fur and bearing a head and face like that of a hyena, I recognized it as a kobold. They are native to the Toxullia forest, more plentiful on the Paineel side of the of the river and use their claws and teeth with wicked effect to bring down their prey.</p>

<p>This particular kobold didn't look as large as some of the ones I have heard tales of or seen in pictures, but it was more than up to the task of dispatching me, I knew without a doubt.</p>

<p>As it looked around, probably wondering where it was and why, I looked toward the door to make good my exit. Only there WAS no door, or sign that there had ever been one. The wall at my back looked as plain and solid as the rest of the room. Then it spotted me.</p>

<p>I was even more shocked when it spoke: 'Erudites like you have caused my clan trouble for centuries. I don't know how I came to be here, but now I will trouble YOU.' Its words came out in a series of snarls that I could only barely make out.</p>

<p>Immediately, I began to cast a protective spell, a very weak spell of shielding which was the only one of its kind I knew at the time. As the energy swirled around me and the spell took hold, the kobold paused slightly at the green light spilling out from me. This gave me the chance to circle around the desk and put it between myself and the creature.</p>

<p>I felt the spell bolster me, forming a thin barrier around me and also increasing my body's toughness, making me less prone to injury. Not nearly enough to make me impervious to the creature before me, I was sure, but better than nothing at all.</p>

<p>When the kobold attacked, I was barely prepared. Its powerful hind-leg muscles bunched and it sprang straight over the desk at me, claws flailing. I was able to twist to my right and avoid being hit dead on, but not before a wicked claw raked across my chest, opening three gashes from my right shoulder to my left. I cried out and jumped back, my left hand pressed across my chest, feeling the blood beginning to soak my robes. Shield spell or not, the thing possessed strength enough for the job. I began to cast another spell.</p>

<p>The kobold hopped onto the desk, its dark eyes boring into me, as I struggled to keep my concentration on the spell of summoning which I desperately needed to stay alive. The creature seemed in a mood to toy with me, and didn't immediately attack again. Not being a senseless animal, it wasn't in a hurry to make the kill. Just what I needed.</p>

<p>I completed the spell and a dagger appeared in my right hand, its blade gleaming in the light from the ugly chandelier. The kobold looked slightly surprised at my suddenly having a weapon. Now it had a little less control of the situation, or so I hoped.</p>

<p>I was not a master of physical combat by any means, and to this day I do not rely on it for my defence, my magic sustains me. Still, like all students of the caster guilds in Erudin, I was taught the very basics of dagger fighting. It was by no means an extensive training, just more along the lines of knowing how not to cut yourself while inflicting some sort of damage on the enemy. Now I found myself wishing that I had paid more attention to my trainer. Life is full of little surprises.</p>

<p>Well, hindsight is seldom a useful tool, and it was of even less use to me now. The creature's muscles bunched and it prepared to spring again. I had time to crouch, my dagger held mid-level before me in my right hand, my left hand held lower than the right. Then the creature was in the air: A blur of fur, fangs and claws speeding toward me. As it came down, straight at me, I twisted and sprang to the right, my dagger thrusting down and to the left into the ball of fury that was the attacking kobold.</p>

<p>I felt a satisfying pressure on the dagger, followed by the sound of it slicing through fur and flesh. Next to me, the kobold howled and pressed a clawed hand to its left side. I smiled grimly, fresh blood gleaming on my dagger.</p>

<p>I was determined not make this easy for the creature and the wound I had given it strengthened my resolved and my confidence, and ultimately made me cocky.</p>

<p>I should have circled away when I landed the blow, put more distance between myself and the creature. Instead, I stood still, trying to assess how much damage I had done, a mistake I paid for as the kobold made an unexpected lunge, low to the ground, its arms sweeping around from its sides.</p>

<p>A set of claws slashed deep gouges in the meat of each of my calves and I was swept off my feet, landing hard on my back. I felt the air rush from my lungs at the impact, leaving me gasping for breath and trying to sit up while dark spots swam before my eyes. It was then that the creature landed on top of me.</p>

<p>Its hind-quarters settled on my stomach, rear legs on the ground to either side of me, and then the creature leaned forward, coming for me with both sets of claws and a muzzle full of very capable fangs. I had the presence of mind to bring up my arms. My right hand bracing the dagger to meet the kobold's left paw and my left hand closing about its right wrist.</p>

<p>When my dagger cut across its left paw, it promptly withdrew it with a small howl. Its right claw, however, continued to come for my throat. I reversed the dagger, blade down, meaning to drive it into the thing's face, but it was quicker and used its injured paw to catch my dagger hand and press it into the floor. In the meantime, its right paw slowly descended toward my throat. I tried with all my strength to push it away, but I wasn't strong enough and I knew it. The claws inched closer.</p>

<p>It was at this time that I looked up, past the thing's grinning visage and to the ceiling, meaning to pray to Quellios to make my death quick. In that instant, I saw my chance. A small chance, to be sure, but a chance nonetheless.</p>

<p>I began to cast the one offensive spell I knew, a fire-based attack named Burst of Flame. With the pain of my wounds and the strain of trying to hold back the kobold' claws, the effort to concentrate on the spell was almost more than I could put forth, but I had to try, there was no other way. The creature must have noticed the glow of the energy coming from my hands as the spell began, but ignored it, focussing only on driving its claws into my throat.</p>

<p>Then, just as its claw-tips touched my throat and began to pierce the soft flesh there, I completed my spell and released its energy. The kobold paused as it felt the heat from the fire which flared to life above its head, then looked up as it heard the remaining cords which held the giant chandelier in place snap. Its howl of outrage was cut off sharply when one of the chandelier's equally sharp points punched through its skull and into its brain.</p>

<p>I felt the impact, and the sickening thud of the thing's body being pierced with the chandelier's spikes. I only barely escaped being run through myself, but found that now I was trapped beneath the dead kobold AND the chandelier.</p>

<p>I lay like that for several minutes, wondering how much blood I had lost and also how I would find the energy needed to actually roll the kobold and chandelier off me. Then, there was a familiar blue glow off to my right and a smiling Markus Jaevins stepped into the room from the midst of it.</p>

<p>His smile filled me with a murderous rage, and had I been free, I would have attacked him on the spot. As it was, all I could do was lie there, fuming silently. He raised his left hand and made a flicking motion which gently rolled the kobold and chandelier away from me. I was on my feet in a flash, dagger in hand, moving toward him with a dangerous, if fool-hardy, purpose. Fortunately, his words stopped me in mid stride.</p>

<p>'I name you GateCaller, Tarendor Grimfyre. Kidrian chose well.'</p>

<p>The mention of my old friend's name made me stop. I thought of all he had said to me on that last night we talked, all he had promised I would become. And in that moment, my rage evaporated, replaced with a resolve that I had not felt before. I dismissed the dagger and looked at Markus Jaevins.</p>

<p>'Will that be all, Guildmaster? Or was there something else?' I was rather proud at how even my voice was, considering that I could have happily ripped his head off at that moment. The rage was gone, but resentment remained.</p>

<p>'You have learned well, young one. Few would have passed that test with the few basic spells and limited warning you were given. You show a rare talent for thinking on your feet, as it were. Kidrian told me that he foresaw a great future for you, it seems he was not mistaken. You will bring pride upon our name?'</p>

<p>Time seems to fly by every time I add to this journal. It is already sunset and the docks are almost deserted now. I wish I had time to write more. As I cast a final glance at the gently rolling waters before me, I remember happier times. Times from my boyhood when I strolled along this small beach with Kidrian by my side, always talking to me and telling me wondrous stories from the old days, making me laugh like no one else could. </p>

<p>Its funny how even now, I feel the loss of him, and I wish I could see him once more. I wish I had spent more time with him when I had the chance. Empty wishes, that time has passed. And now I must be my own council, answer the hard questions myself. Walk the path alone.</p>

<p>Not easy, not easy at all.</p>
