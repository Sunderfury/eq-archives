<p>Yep.. them again.. but for some POSITIVE news...  Boy.. let me tell you.. good thing we still love each other like family, else, I'd be a Keneras Toaster Pastry :)  Why?  Good question :)
<p>
Last night, I got home from work, turned on the ol PC and got connected and started EQ.  Logged in.. so far so good.. Ran my way over to Kithicor woods.. (Yes.. Keneras El Stupido).  Found Iklyn, Seeny, Loch, Xerintha .. all hanging out front... Also found our lovely Kilyena there too.. well.. I sat and watched as they cut down the undead for a few..  Seeny just gave me a SoW (because I was going to make a run for it to get to West Comms so I could run to Guk) and then POOF. ZZZZZzzt .. POOF.. 
<p>
Ever hear someone talking about &quot;letting the magic smoke out of your system&quot; ?  Well, that's just what happened.. the magic smoke came out of my monitor !  Hehe.. Yep.. honest to god smoke &amp; fire and that nice little arc sound.  Well.. I did the only intelligent thing I could think of.. (no, it didn't involve pouring water into a live monitor &lt;g&gt;).. I turned the monitor off...  (I had to keep the PC on because I'm proxying off my dial up connection so that Thorgar and Tawna could play.. ) 
<p>
So.. here I am in the middle of Undead Central.. can't see a thing.. so I figure.. &quot;ok.. do a /exit and regardless of the fact I can't see.. I should be able to log out...&quot;  Sounded logical.. sounded feasible... sounded like a plan.. Unfortunately.. it only SOUNDED like one.. BECAUSE I COULDN&quot;T SEE &lt;g&gt;.. 
<p>
So.. I unplugged the monitor and et. al thinking that I was safely out of the game but still connected so Tawna could play.. I jet for the comp store about 5 mins away to buy a new monitor (thank god yesterday was payday).  Picked up a new 19&quot; Viewsonic monitor.. crammed it into my rental car and headed back for the apt.  Total time so far.. about 30 mins.. Get back.. Unpack new monitor.. Gasp at the size (Size does matter.. in the monitor world).. plug it in to see the picture and...
<p>
AAAAHH!!! I'm still in the game!!!
<p>
Somehow I was in the middle of typing text and added the /exit to the text.. so.. everyone around me saw me say something with /exit in it. DOH!  But ya know.. I was still standing where I was at.. Tawna told me that while I was gone, it sounded like &quot;all hell was breaking loose&quot; (probably because I was planning on running thru Kithi at 7:00pm Norrath time.. so the fun was just beginning as I was leaving..
<p>
Those GB folks surely must have kept me alive because when I came back on.. I was still in the same spot.. never moved (how I didn't get Fear'd is a total mystery) and I was full health..  Gotta love those guys.. (and gals.. )
<p>
Later on.. was fighting with some more GB during the Unrest Movement &lt;g&gt;.. Saw Mardack there.. we were helpin the residents of Unrest out of their misery with help from GB, headed up by Chula.  What fun that was!
<p>
Hey everyone.. we CAN play nice together!!  Let's do this more!
