Let me see if I can clarify this for myself and any others. 
<p>
In the past, if you FDed on most mobs (excluding SGs, lava beetles, Sonics, etc, which are essentially unchanged.), they remained HOSTILE to you, but if you were not in Agro range or LoS, they did not come running for you. Later, they would attack you IF they wandered close to you again, IF they were trained nearby, or IF you accidentally got too close to them again. 
<p>
Now, they come from anywhere IMMEDIATELY, unless you got lucky on the Memory Blur effect. 
<p>
Oddly, the change makes the skill's usefulness much more random. You win or lose the roll. Before, you had some control. 
<p>
Is that a good summary? 
<p>

<p>
The problem is you don't know any more. 
<p>
You used to be able to feign and know that if the monsters had walked away, when you got up you were safe. 
<p>
Now when you get up and head for the zone, you don't know if you are safe, or if you have a train coming at you. 
<p>
A lot of the time you may never even know you had a train - depending on the mob type or if you feign again it is likely to end up attacking someone else on the way.
<p>
------------------------------------------------
<p>
Well, that is it in a nutshell.  Because we do not know, and because we have no control, Monks can get swamped or train the hell out of people and never even realize it.  The lack of consistent reliability will endanger everyone.  Verant needs to put FD Back.
