<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Allright this shit has been long in coming ... I'm gonna try and keep it a constructive rant so here goes:
<p>
A number of issues have popped up in EQ that must be addressed, and I plan to start by trying to FIX Veeshan.
<p>
1. ROLLING FOR LOOT
Nothing good came of this &quot;addition&quot; to the game. Let me elaborate. Back in the &quot;day&quot;... we used to keep going back to a spawn till everyone got what they needed, to the extent of what is possible barring real life limitations of course. 6 Pairs of boots of Drelz? Sure, we all COME BACK and get everyone some damn bewts. I personally went thru at least 15 fbss that were gotten in groups and claimed none for myself. Nobody rolled for them, highest level got em first since they can do the most damage, and it went down the line based on who was at that camp longest, etc. We HELPED eachother get shit and we liked it that way. Then comes rolls. Melee getting caster shit, casters getting melee shit, fags in /shout &quot;FBSS for 2 YAKS&quot;. Guys.. all that stuff is in the same dungeon. what happened to killing lord for yaks.
<p>
My point is... loot and the mobs they are on has lost all meaning. Basically Guk Magi drops efreet boots, Lord drops 1/2 a sash, and so on. People help eachother with equipment as long as they need something there and shove off to the next guk farm. Basically a bunch of lvl 50 newbies that always fail dragons/planes because they simply don't know eachother well and don't know eachothers tactics. And when dragon loot falls, it simply goes to the wrong people often times.
<p>
Basically rolling has it's place... everyone is equipped with said loot that needs it.. lets roll so we can take what is left for whatever you plan to do with it. Game economy is totally shit so you have to sell decent camped goods if you need a lot of money.. for anything. Trades skills didn't address this problem much. heck you wre at efreet a million times and that bitch never dropped you a pair when you were 14th in line, sure trade for that sash nobody wanted and you won a roll for may be cool. in exchange for melee help in camping efreet, help camp them a sash when they need one.
<p>
2. SIMPLE LACK OF SKILLS
I see too many people while playing enchanter (now lvl 47) that don't know how to navigate bukbottom. YET they are FULLY equipped with guk's toys... and I am not talking about secondaries either, I'm talkin lvl 50 newbies. Plain and simple knowledge, real experience and a good network of friends (guild or non-guild) is bigger than any &quot;loot&quot; in this game. Once the other three are in line and with some patience the loot will fall in a rain.
<p>
Why has this become a problem? 
<p>
a) Friends thinking that newbies that just got their new 'puter for christmas should be powerleveled/twinked to their level so they can &quot;party&quot; with them. This is a dis-service in the long run, I promise you that. It used to take much longer to reach 50 and people simply appreciated it more, these are the folks I refer to as &quot;old-school&quot;... they know what it was like to start as a newbie wearing cloth armor and scrounge for copper. Gettin to 50 the way the game was meant to be played is how you truly build a character with &quot;character&quot;. Sure this isn't much of a role-play environment but we each have a personality we have invested in the characters to some degree. Gettin lvl 50 in a week for a total newbie getting twinked = grouping with me is never gonna happen.
<p>
b) Weapons way beyond one's level, something secondaries are known for (and incidentally what drives much of the game &quot;economy&quot;) has made newbies think this is the norm to want a yak at lvl 10. There is clearly only one way to fix this and that is to make lvl limits on all items but frankly most players and specifically Verant is satisfied with all the economies and people pouring more money into their subscriptions as well as getting 2 or more subscriptions. Unfortunately the newbies don't read this board, mostly Veterans do, so this goes to YOU. Secondaries and equipping seconds is what keeps many people interested in the game so I'm not going to fight that.
<p>
c) Dungeons ain't what they used to be when I was a newbie.... Fully popped befallen, fully popped unrest, full popped guk, fully popped sol a / sol b. This is where the MAD skillz are learned and getting used to dying a lot is learned as well. Failed Plane breaks? YOu guessed it... people don't know how to pull or ellicit mad asswoopin anymore since they have no practice with what i'm talking about. MOST (95%) of lvl 50s are just plain ol newbies with some gear. WOOPTEDOO you camped the Lord room when almost the rest of the dungeon is fully dead and druids can be seen kiting shit in guk... back in the &quot;day&quot; that was unheard of. We camped almost every camp in deadside or liveside at the SAME time, and used 2 groups fighting together and developed multi group skillz.
<p>
Suggestion: Get outta the planes and go step into a empty dungeon (aka Paw) and pull like mad dogs... with mobs charming and things going totally apeshit... where mobs will surely HAND YOU YOUR ASS on a plate... cant find enuff mobs? Get your INSANE cleric to pull 40 mobs to you at once from zone to the center.
<p>
d) the loot fixation must end, anyone I see wearing an item they clearly can't achieve on their own (or with a primary) are instantly banned from my groups from here on out. I suggest anyone with any self respect to the same. I'm with that group of people that believe loot should MEAN SOMETHING or hold some status. A mark of your skill in grouping, not your skill in mad trading.
<p>
<p>
If you got no idea what I'm talking about with all this then you haven't seen me play, most people will tell you that my demands in combat are obscene, the exp and loot falls like rain, and the everyone LEARNS something far more about their class than simple loot would have ever gotten them. Those that have shown mad skillz as primaries in my groups I make it known... specifically non-guild: 
<p>
Arianas lvl 50 druid - heals like a cleric and is superior in efficient casting, as good or better then even some of our own guild's druids. Yet to be experienced in the ways of many planar combats but will be superior yet again I am sure... and a man of loyalty suckas... something most of you will never understand.
<p>
Tatanka lvl 50 wizard - followed in the ways of Blazar and will surely surpass the mad prophecies of wizard ownage on Veeshan. The REBELS WILL KNOW THE FULL POWER OF THE DEATH STAR. Those of you know think wizards suck... you simply are newbies to this game still, wake up. Oh yes, and some people like medding, gives time to chat... nothing wrong with that. Thx exp.
<p>
Nullo lvl 35 cleric - uhh lvl 50 magician on Tarew Marr now on veeshan, friend of FoH, exemplary in the clerical tactics even at lvl 35 and a cumulative 2 wisdom, more efficient in healing than most lvl 45's. FEAR his bronze armor suckas.
<p>
Dayton lvl 49 warrior - follows the rules of UBER pulling. Listen's to someone who knows what the game is about and learns fast. Starting to remind me of Kalaran as a youth... far to go but the FORCE is with this young JEDI.
<p>
I don't need to mention most of the guild because frankly there are few finer players on all the servers combined. How do we do it? practice makes perfect sissies... look into it.
<p>
3. PROBLEMS WITH INTER-GUILD COOPERATION.
Guildleaders: don't let your newbie lvl 50 engage in idiotic rants in /shout against another guild or person. I have personally had affronts to my integrity that resulted from newbies not knowing that I've been here since day one and simply dont gave a rats ass in HELL what they think is &quot;fair&quot; or whatever. I know some of our own guildies have done and said things to other guilds, and frankly some of these members have been /guildremoved for being idiotic time and time again. Is there a reason shit hits the fan in planes? Yes... the leaders don't talk/cuss/whip eachother to settle scores, a bunch of gimps start yelling at eachother. Next time a guild has us &quot;banned&quot; from a zone... this is possible it seems. That ENTIRE guild is gonna start going on an ignore list the size of the Veteran's Memorial. Cope with problems in GAME and quit petitioning you sissy fags. &quot;Look, someone else is in my sandbox, I'm gonna go call mommy&quot; ... it makes you all look like SISSIES. Fear the my wrath and how shitty it is going to make you look when I post on this board again with specifics for all of EQ to laugh at, nobody cares what you say in rebuttal, No discussion will be held. The counterflames will simply look childish in the face of pure truth.
<p>
<p>
take something from this ... use the knowledge wisely. DO what it says, quit fooling around and Veeshan and your guilds will attain a glory again that will make other servers weep in admiration.
<p>
Gimp = most players in EQ that simply lack an understanding of the roots of the game and what it means to be a true PLAYA.
<p>
Verant needs to add more of a new kind of dungeon, in a sense like skyplane.. impossible to beat. Made accesible to guilds, complete with rafters for visitors... a place where people can get together and prove their skills and hone their abilities. The LOOT: no stats... just a insignia which goes over your current armor which signifies your skills in this game.
