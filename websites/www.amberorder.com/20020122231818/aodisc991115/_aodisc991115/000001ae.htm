<p>WOW!  You cannot imagine how many times I told people, &quot;I miss BB1!  Where did he go?&quot;
<p>
I am glad you checked in Bro!  Where have you been?  Off on some NSA Mission?  In jail for cracking systems?  On the run from a jealous husband? Hehe.
<p>
I took a break from M59, and lo and behold I come back and you were gone.  Always felt bad I never had a chance to say goodbye and good luck.  Glad to see you back.  Yes, we all pretty much did move to EQ. It is a very cool game.  Get it, get an account, and join us online on the E'ci server.
<p>
John is still Da Man, with the name morphing from Bear to Bearpaws.  Leah pretty much went her own way quite a while back.  I actually think someone said she was on EQ, but she and AO have gone in different directions, alas.  Look for us on E'ci.  I am Zpai or Harker.  Lion is there as Hambonee.  You saw Temp's post.  Chordless is there too, as Machord. Oh yes, and Wlfraven is there as Chula.  Plus, there are a ton of really cool people you have yet to meet.  There are lots of us there, and you can bet we'll be glad to see you and help you get started.  
<p>
You haven't changed much over the years have you?  I mean, you're still an stubborn, abrasive, hot-headed, obnoxious butthead, right?
<p>
Glad to see you online again!  Welcome home, bro!
