<p>We hear enough negative things about people in the game, so I thought you'd enjoy hearing about the kind of generous selflessness that makes us all feel good.  I was in a group doing one of those endless sol b camps &lt;fake fake fake garbage loot fake fake etc&gt; when one of the group's members auctioned a particularly valuable item on &lt;you guessed it&gt; a trade only basis.  I inquired, confirmed plat was of no interest to the party in question and that I unfortunately had nothing to trade that they needed.  Says I, since I'd really like to get that for my daughter's cleric, please tell me what you're looking for in trade.  Says the other party, here's the item for free with my best wishes to your daughter -- no thought of how many hours it took to camp it or what it was worth -- just a spontaneous gesture of generousity.  Best of all, it was one of our own. 
How do I repay this debt?  Easy -- just help someone else out, and, oh yes, let em know about this little incident and remind them that this is what we are &lt;or should be&gt; all about.  Leave the rat race for real life.  Bravo Braveheart sister !!   And need I mention, she is a formidable ally to have standing by one's side?  
<p>
  Hail AO !!
