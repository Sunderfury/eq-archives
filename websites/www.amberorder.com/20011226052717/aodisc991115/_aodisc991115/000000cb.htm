<p>Yeah, well Grim, when you log on, there's this little screen that comes up that reminds you the game accounts are for adults only, that any child playing is doing so at the discretion of their parent, and that basically the game was intended for those over 18. Having raised 5 kids myself to the age of 18 or better safely, I really think some folks are just over reacting. There's no need to try to sanitize me, I really ain't that outrageous, I watch my language, I'm honest, and I can be trusted not to corrupt our youth. I might occasionally have a silly grin on my face, but I didn't break into your car. There's far worse out there, and it just ticks me that when I try to bring up the little thing about the way folks hail, that rather than having it discussed, I immediately get attacked in tells by an officer, about another subject that she's never mentioned to me ever before. If she's gonna flame me at least, take it to guildsay, it's meant to be a discussion, not a power trip. Anyway, really, this time I ain't into long discussions about this, I thank you for your support, but I'll be much happier without having to worry about what some officer's agenda is, and whether it's just meant to keep me, as some sort of bad influence, away from any meaningful input as to what kind of guild it is. I'll just look elsewhere, it's been fun, but I ain't about to cry over it.</p>
