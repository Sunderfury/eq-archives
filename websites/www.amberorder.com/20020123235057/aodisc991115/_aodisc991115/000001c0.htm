<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>   My friends and companions, my time has come to leave the world of Everquest.  I have really enjoyed the game and my guild has been a big part of what I enjoy most, the interaction.  But, I really havn't the time to dedicate to the persuit of higher levels anymore, and, while that shouldn't really be a big deal, to me (a rather goal oriented type) it is.  So, to get rid of the nagging voices that say...  &quot;Go camp for XP!  You're friends are becoming too high level for you to adventure with!&quot; I have decided to completely abandon EQ.
<p>
   And, I must admit.  Camping SolB, usually with strangers, for hours at a time is sort of boring.  It is a lot different from the amazing times I had in the first 25 levels where everything was new.
<p>
   While I'm leaving EQ, I am NOT leaving Amber Order however.  New online games will be coming out soon and I'll be looking for some of you to play them with.  I am hoping that Diablo 2, the sequel to the game that originally got me playing these VR worlds, will have the same appeal of the first.  That being that you can dive right into an adventure without having to ride a boat for half the time you have available in an evening.  We'll see.
<p>
   On a side note, I've been liquidating my assets and will have a few thousand plat around.  It isn't going to be a motherload mind you.  Maybe 5K or so since I bought 2 gnomish tinkers bags (at 5K apiece) for my two best EQ friends (Say hello to Qualm and Rainen for me).  Purrhaps a guild credit union is in order?
<p>
   I'll miss you all on EQ.  But, don't consider me to be gone.  I enjoy online games, and, their greatest appeal is the interaction and sense of community.  Thats why I'll be snooping in the background.  I'm still debating if I should close my account completely or maybe hang onto it for another couple months so that I can occasionally help, or powerlevel a guildmate.
<p>
