                   By Joe Stafford
                   American-Statesman Staff
                   Friday, January 21, 2000
<p>
                   After the massacre in Littleton last year,
                   investigators discovered that the two killers loved
                   Doom, the granddaddy of frenetic, kill-everything
                   computer games. Often played online, these are
                   the games for which blood-spattered terms such
                   as fragfest and gibs were invented to describe
                   the carnage. Calls rang out to ban them, to stop
                   the spread of the virtual ultra-violence. 
<p>
                   But some experts think that type of game play is a dead end anyway -- more
                   and more spectacular environments in which to kill and kill again, yawn -- and
                   that the real future of online game play is toward more complex social worlds
                   that emphasize teamwork and cooperation. 
<p>
                   I've played computer games for years, but I wanted to test that theory from the
                   inside, to enter these strange realms, these fabulously realistic 3-D worlds, to
                   play the games, meet the players virtual-face to virtual-face, to dodge the
                   flying shrapnel and the acid arrows, to ask the questions and to coyly turn
                   down the sexual propositions. 
<p>
                   Did I mention these are strange realms? 
<p>
                   Why are you here? 
<p>
                   Welcome to the Holodeck, the brave new world, the chat room with firepower.
                   Where the future lies. Where the $10 monthly fees on credit cards lie. Where
                   your dreams and nightmares all come true, but, more than anything, where
                   you meet people, make friends and, oh, yeah, kill them. 
<p>
                   None of these virtual worlds is a place I'd want my 8-year-old daughter to
                   venture. Everyone is a stranger, everyone is in disguise, represented by a
                   fantasy figure of their own choosing, from futuristic missile-launching soldier to
                   troll. These are high-powered masquerades where anything can happen, with
                   anonymity fueling the worst in some people. Especially in first-person
                   shooters, played on unregulated private servers where anything goes, the
                   conversation can get primitive really fast. 
<p>
                   How would you explain how it works to an 8-year-old girl, anyway? Well, it's
                   like this. First you buy the game, choosing from a huge variety of titles such
                   as Warcraft, Rainbow Six, Quake, Unreal, Tribes. You get the game home,
                   remove the shrink wrap from the CD, follow the directions and install the game
                   on your computer's hard drive. Then, hooked up via modem, you connect to a
                   distant computer over the Internet, sometimes for free, sometimes for a small
                   monthly fee. Other players connect to the same computer and together you
                   enter the game and interact in real-time. 
<p>
                   In the world of the first-person shooters, you see through the eyes of your
                   character. In other realms you see over your character's shoulder, or from
                   above at an angle. You meet others, you play together, you chat. 
<p>
                   But in the frenetic butcher halls of games like Quake and Unreal, it's hard to
                   talk to anyone. People hop into these worlds from their work computers,
                   often, from all around the globe, to jump around and blast away for 20
                   minutes, to get a quick fix. Just try to chat with them: 
<p>
                   &quot;Pardon me!&quot; I type. 
<p>
                   SPLAT! I'm dead, pulverized by a rocket. 
<p>
                   &quot;I wanted to ask . . .&quot; I type after respawning, or coming back to life. 
<p>
                   POW! Dead again. 
<p>
                   &quot;Oh, forget it . . .&quot; I type. 
<p>
                   SPLAP! Dead. 
<p>
                   Hmm. That didn't work. 
<p>
                   WHAP! 
<p>
                   Thank goodness there are other, less angry worlds. 
<p>
                   I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore when I logged onto Everquest, Sony's
                   massively multi-player online role-playing game (known by the
                   easy-off-the-tongue MMORPG) and found myself running through a
                   dripping-wet rainforest as a huge ogre, hunting frogs with dozens of other trolls
                   and ogres uttering phrases like &quot;Blorg kill frog dead.&quot; 
<p>
                   The people playing these games are adult-ish, computer-wise modern people
                   and yet here they're bounding through pretend forests using pretend clubs to
                   kill pretend frogs. I bounce up to an ogre, a mean-faced thing dressed in
                   skins, wagging a club. I type the message: &quot;Beg pardon, I'm a reporter for a
                   newspaper and I wanted to ask you a couple questions about online gaming.&quot; 
<p>
                   &quot;Og no talk now. Og kill stuff,&quot; he types in return. Og shuffles off into the
                   gloom. Hmm. That didn't work. 
<p>
                   Eventually, though, you do make friends and meet people who aren't too busy
                   killing stuff to chat. 
<p>
                   The future of online gaming 
<p>
                   Back in the real world, one expert says games that emphasize the greatest
                   strength of the Internet -- communication -- are where the future lies. 
<p>
                   &quot;It was really a surprise that shooters became as important as they are,
                   because they are definitely anti-social,&quot; says Greg Costikyan, author of &quot;The
                   Future of Online Gaming.&quot; 
<p>
                   &quot;I think we're returning to what online games were 10 years ago,&quot; he says,
                   referring to text-based games -- MUDs or Multiple User Dungeons --
                   popularized on college campuses in the late '80s. &quot;The ability to play online
                   gives you an intelligent opponent, which is always better than artificial
                   intelligence, and it gives you contacts. You can talk to people.&quot; 
<p>
                   There is solid evidence of a shift. Austin's own Origin Systems is a case in
                   point. In July, the company, a subsidiary of the California gaming giant
                   Electronic Arts, set off a storm of disappointed protests from fans when it
                   dropped its A-10 Warthog flight simulator and announced plans to devote all
                   its efforts to online gaming. 
<p>
                   Origin pioneered the multiplayer genre with Ultima Online, in which
                   approximately 150,000 subscribers populate a dragon-infested magical world.
                   The company plans to add much more social structure to its new version of
                   the game, UO2, due out this year. 
<p>
                   &quot;We've learned a lot about online entertainment over the past two years since
                   we launched Ultima Online,&quot; said Jeff Anderson, executive producer for UO2.
                   &quot;But most important, we've learned that we are not just making games
                   anymore. We're building virtual worlds that will offer new ways for people to
                   interact and socialize.&quot; 
<p>
                   Another example of the trend is hinted at in the much-anticipated Team
                   Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms, due out this year from Valve, the makers of
                   the hit shooter Half-Life. 
<p>
                   &quot;It's not about deathmatch with better graphics,&quot; game producer Gabe Newell
                   says in the January issue of the gaming magazine Incite. &quot;It's about really
                   thinking about what groups of friends are going to enjoy doing together.&quot; Team
                   Fortress 2 will force players to work as a close-knit team to defeat enemies in
                   a war zone and will include a built-in voice communication system -- a first. 
<p>
                   Other companies are moving in a similar direction. Microsoft released its own
                   MMORPG, Asheron's Call, to good reviews in time for Christmas and plans an
                   outer-space-style massive player game soon, both leaning heavily on the
                   social aspect of the experience. In Asheron's Call, players spend half their
                   time standing around chatting, planning trips into the large 3-D world and
                   exchanging virtual equipment. 
<p>
                   Meet my patron, the warrior Angmar 
<p>
                   Perhaps my most revealing experience was in befriending Angmar, a warrior
                   who dwells in the world of Asheron's Call. 
<p>
                   The game calls for pledges of loyalty to other players, and I picked Angmar
                   more or less at random. My only stipulation was that I wanted someone who
                   was online a lot. 
<p>
                   &quot;How often do you play this game?&quot; I typed. 
<p>
                   &quot;Enough that it's hurting my GPA,&quot; he typed back. 
<p>
                   Good enough for me. Figuring he was a college kid, I vowed loyalty and he
                   gave me some nifty equipment and advice and we hunted several strange
                   species of creatures together. Only later did I find out he lives in Austin. And
                   goes to Westwood High School. And is 15 years old. 
<p>
                   Suddenly I felt very old. &quot;I had the impression you were older,&quot; I said. 
<p>
                   &quot;That's the equal anonymity of the Internet,&quot; Angmar said. &quot;Age really doesn't
                   matter online.&quot; 
<p>
                   For those seeking proof that online games are about more than just killing,
                   Angmar is a good case. In real life his name is Alex Dodwell, a sophomore
                   who plays cello in the orchestra, competes in soccer and is on the debate
                   team. 
<p>
                   &quot;Talking is the main reason to play games online,&quot; he said. &quot;Even while you're
                   killing monsters, you're still chatting. It has all the allure of a chat room but
                   you get to play a fun game at the same time.&quot; 
<p>
                   Angmar hasn't been online as much lately since his dad put his foot down.
                   &quot;I'm pretty embarrassed to say it does occupy a lot of my time,&quot; Alex said,
                   &quot;but it doesn't really cut into my studies too bad. I spend probably two or
                   three hours a night online.&quot; 
<p>
                   The upside of Angmar's -- Alex's -- interest in computers is that he has
                   become something of an expert with them, building computers from scratch
                   and even considering a high-tech career someday. 
<p>
                   &quot;I've always been able to swim elbow-deep in my computer,&quot; he said. &quot;My
                   mom and dad are always asking me to fix things on theirs. So my interest in
                   computers might result in a career. It helps my typing skills, if nothing else.&quot; 
<p>
                   The late show gets a little blue 
<p>
                   A big part of the fun is choosing how you'll appear to others. Even the
                   shooters let you choose from dozens of options. Cyborg? Bodacious,
                   gun-toting cyberbabe? Cigar-chomping drill sergeant? 
<p>
                   And maybe it's the testosterone of the game designers or the players or both,
                   but these worlds almost universally feature characters who are pumped up,
                   steroidal and sexy in a freakish way. In the fragfest games the men bulge with
                   muscles that make Schwarzenegger look like Olive Oyl and the women are
                   cut-looking with gleaming metal bustiers. 
<p>
                   Playing as a male woodland elf one night in Everquest I was propositioned by
                   a female woodland elf, a really good-looking blonde. 
<p>
                   &quot;Make a sign if your interested,&quot; the good-looking elf thing typed. 
<p>
                   &quot;Interested in what?&quot; I typed back. 
<p>
                   &quot;You know,&quot; the elf thing said. &quot;Doing things.&quot; 
<p>
                   &quot;Things?&quot; I typed. 
<p>
                   &quot;Together. Anything you want,&quot; the elf thing said. &quot;I'll do anything.&quot; 
<p>
                   &quot;I'm not sure what you mean,&quot; I said. 
<p>
                   Exasperated, I guess, the good-looking elf thing ran away into the gloom. 
<p>
                   It's just as well. As my friend Angmar later said, &quot;It was probably a
                   40-year-old pot-bellied guy sitting at his keyboard in his underwear.&quot; 
<p>
                   This is your life 
<p>
                   As these encounters hint, for some people, the games are much more than
                   games. They're more like an alternative life or even a second job. And,
                   anecdotally at least, they're filled mostly with males. In point of fact, the
                   games are so male-dominated that female players have a tough time
                   convincing others that they're not &quot;role-playing&quot; a woman. 
<p>
                   &quot;I had someone ask me this weekend if I was really female,&quot; said Debbie
                   Johnson of Tulsa, Okla., who plays a war magician, Lia of Leafcull, in
                   Asheron's Call. &quot;I replied yes, and then he asked what age. When I replied
                   `Over 40,' he said, `Yeah, sure, I bet.' &quot; 
<p>
                   A Web site administrator for Avis Rent-a-Car, married 25 years with no kids,
                   Lia/Debbie started playing these kinds of games two years ago and has since
                   persuaded her 70-year-old dad to join her online. 
<p>
                   Another female player for whom online gaming is a family affair -- of another
                   kind -- is Judy Winget of Cincinnati, who also plays Asheron's Call. She's 41,
                   a mother of two young children, a professional business analyst who spends
                   her free time as Reiki Anzho, the magical monarch of The Mystic Order of
                   Blackthorn. 
<p>
                   &quot;I've been through a divorce because my ex found `the love of his life' playing
                   (the online game) Yserbius,&quot; she said, citing what is apparently not an
                   uncommon occurrence in the these worlds. &quot;Though he's still single
                   three-and- a-half years after the divorce,&quot; Reiki/Judy added. 
<p>
                   &quot;After the separation, I met a wonderful man playing (online games) and we've
                   since married,&quot; she said. Now the two of them play online together, often
                   meeting in the virtual world. 
<p>
                   For Reiki/Judy, the games are as much about conversation as about hunting
                   and adventuring. 
<p>
                   &quot;The upshot is, yes, I play because of the social interaction,&quot; Judy/Reiki said.
                   &quot;If I had to do it alone and had no friends to share the joy with, what would be
                   the point?&quot; 
<p>
                   Virtual games, real-life money 
<p>
                   But for some people the games are, partly at least, about making money. 
<p>
                   Though not officially sanctioned by the game makers, the selling of items and
                   characters from the persistent worlds such as Ultima, Asheron and Everquest
                   has become common on Internet auction sites such as eBay. 
<p>
                   For Terry King, 30, who has played Ultima Online since the beginning two
                   years ago, this phenomenon translates into more than pocket change. The
                   five-year Dell employee spends 35 hours a week in the fantasy world,
                   generally playing Red Alkeistarte, an evil lord who can summon giant demons
                   to his defense. Terry creates virtual characters and buildings he can sell in the
                   real world. 
<p>
                   For instance, he recently sold his virtual castle from the Ultima realm at an
                   online auction site for some $3,000 cash money and sold a tower for $1,500
                   and a couple of houses for about $500 each. These bits of virtual real estate
                   give a character great prestige and take months or years of steady playing to
                   build. Terry/Red said he also makes an extra $200 a week selling characters
                   he has created. 
<p>
                   All that said, Terry/Red maintains that he plays mostly for the people he
                   meets. &quot;I have 350 people on ICQ (an instant online messaging service), and
                   most of them play with me every single week, if not day,&quot; he said. &quot;What I like
                   most is the people I play with, the sense of community and identity.&quot; 
<p>
                   King's wife, Christy, is also an avid gamer, and with four computers in their
                   house the couple often plays in the same world at the same time, but hardly
                   ever see each other in the virtual world. That's because their guilds, the online
                   gaming groups to which they belong, are sworn enemies. 
<p>
                   Christy plays a war mage, Kitty, in the world of Ultima, and finds the online
                   experience very alluring. &quot;I tried Final Fantasy VII (a single-player game), but I
                   didn't like it because it was just me sitting at a computer,&quot; she said. &quot;What
                   keeps you there is the interaction.&quot; 
<p>
                   Many players she meets online want to know if she's a &quot;real&quot; female, Christy
                   said, &quot;And then they immediately want to be your online boyfriend.&quot; 
<p>
                   Game over 
<p>
                   One last experience: I entered the PK server of Asheron's Call -- the so-called
                   Player Killer world where warriors and enchanters can frag you and steal your
                   most valuable stuff, no questions asked -- and I purposely and with some
                   difficulty took my lowly character to the most brutal part of that world, the
                   Direlands. 
<p>
                   And for some reason, seeing a lowly archer in this harsh region where death
                   always lurks touched a chord with many of the high-level players there. Any
                   one of these dozens of mages and warriors could have killed and robbed me
                   instantly, but instead they gave me all kinds of marvelous gifts. At one point I
                   found myself in the midst of three powerful warlords as they simultaneously
                   showered me with magical weapons and jewelry and wished me well. 
<p>
                   If anonymous gaming brings out the worst in some people, in others it seems
                   to bring out the best. And perhaps that is what makes online games so
                   fascinating -- they offer human experience at its least complicated. That
                   means killing. But it also means befriending. 
<p>
                   The bottom line is that making friends is what distinguishes online games
                   from computer games you play without going online. What fascinates, what
                   attracts, is that these universes are peopled, after all, with people.
