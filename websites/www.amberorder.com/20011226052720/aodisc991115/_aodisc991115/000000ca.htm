<p>If you get my gramma hooked on that devil weed I will.... I will....  Thank you she is far to uptight anyway.   Buuut on a different note the guild is getting quite a few youngins and more children are in the online world than before in the &quot;goldne days&quot; of the internet.  This is why behavior has to be watched and whatnot.  I even gotta watch myself for I have a habit of stateing my opinions in an not ver appropriate manner sometimes.  Most of the time I keep my trap shut.  &lt;believe it or not&gt; but sometimes something just HAS to be said.  And well I say it.  Perhaps the timing was wrong but if you truly feel being asked to keep the more adult comments to a lesser group is restricting you too much I understand.  I do agree somewhat with your asking to have the sup ao curbed.  A little respect to your fellow guildmates is a good thing.  Makes us all feel good.  So on some notes I agree with ya Machord.  But for the guild I can understand the asking to curb the adult content some.

As far as exposed flesh.  their is still more in commercials about soap.
