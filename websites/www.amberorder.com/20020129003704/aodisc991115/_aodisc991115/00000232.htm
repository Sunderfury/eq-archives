Starting Notes
<p>
Approval has just been recieved from Verrant for our evil sister guild (the Chaos Legionaires). If you have not read the basic premise for this event/roleplay/wargame forum....then please read my previous article..dated 3/4/00. 
<p>
Now that the framework has been created the next step will be submitting our evil secondary characters to the Legion. I will take this forward rather carefully so please bear with me. A good foundation will ensure a fun and long lasting game.
<p>
my email      nystrom@tampabay.rr.com
<p>
<p>
When you email me put the words EQ or AO in the subject or I will think it might be a virus and delete message...ok.
<p>
1) Please email me a paragraph description of the characters you would like to play in these events. We are going to start with a level range of 6 to 25, but I will not tell people they cant play someone below level 6 (also gettin up to 6 is not very hard so you can submit the character concept to me before you reach the target level...that will be ok too). In time we will adjust the ranges upward in all likeihood, but many events will be quite low level. So, send me a paragraph description with your characters race, hometown, personality description, and some good flavor text to it. What I am going to do is when I recieve them, I will put them all together (and add a paragrah to each one to show how the individuals joined the overall group and tie it together). It is best to submit a couple of characters, especially one evil and one good so that it will be easy to balance things for a given event based on who shows up to play. I will post the complete list here on the discussion board so that we will all know our friends and enemies.
<p>
2) Twinking is fine (good even and Style is the watchword here : ). But, when you submit the character I would like to get a rough idea of the level of the twink (for balance purposes). This will be the format to be included in the email u send me:
<p>
UT (untwinked)    level 15 or less total equiptment cost 300 pp or less. Level 16 to 25 total equiptment value 750 pp or less.
<p>
T (twinked)    level 15 or less total equiptment value 300 pp to 1500 pp. Level 16 to 25 total equiptment value 750 pp to 2000 pp.
<p>
VT (very twinked)    level 15 or less total equiptment value above 1500 pp. Level 16 to 25 total equiptment value over 2000 pp.
<p>
In general this is refering to useful equiptment and not stuff just carried for style. For instance, I have an untwinked level 7 troll. He has generally normal equiptment but wears a ruby bracer for style. The ruby bracer really doesnt add much to his overall power but is very expensive when sold (it looks cool and is why he wears it). He would still be considered untwinked cause overall that is what he is. I'm sure you understand (I will NOT get nit picky about this) and this is really only so that I can keep individual scenarios relatively balanced.
<p>
Please email me when you character goes up a few levels or has a major equiptment change (changing twink categories). I will keep a spreadsheet reasonably updated.
<p>
3) You don't have to play an evil race to play on the evil side (but it is best if most fall into that category as some meetings might be held in Neriack for instance. In which case u might need a level one Flunky type to stand in for you). Just right up a plausible reason why your human or elf or whatever is a back stabbing fear/hate following bastage...&lt;g&gt;. The same is true for the good group.
<p>
4) Include the name of you AO character so I can verify who you are in the guild. In the beginning I will mostly limit this game to AO members and former AO members that we all know and like. Our extended family so to speak. I will verify this at some point as I would hate for someone who doesn't like us to slip in to our game and mess it up.
<p>
Endnotes
<p>
That is basicly it for now. I will organize the lists and put together all the background information as the characters are coming in. I will also be thinking of the first couple of events and stuff to get the ball rolling. Expect it to be alot of fun and it is also up to you all to contribute to others fun as well by trying to stay in character (as much as reasonably possible) and focusing more on what is going on than advancement. You will find that some people will greatly enjoy this style over the more traditional play, and others won't. To that end we will have greatly varying scenarios, (some combat based, some not) and each will offer something a little different to the players. Find out what you like. Share the cool parts of your personality with us and we can do the same. I think we will find that this format may be able to pull the best out of roleplay and virtual gaming like never before seen in other games. That is my goal (I've always been a bit of an ambitious bugger : )
<p>
Finally, ....Bearpaws....at some point you might want to add a section to the web page for &quot;Legion talk&quot; or &quot;Ongoing Scenario&quot; talk. It has the potential of cluttering up the more typical discussion board if my ideas really take off.
<p>
I'm excited, I hope some of you are as well. See you soon and safe travels my friends.
