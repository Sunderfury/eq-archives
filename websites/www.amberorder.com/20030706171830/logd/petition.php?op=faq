<span class='colLtYellow'>Welcome to Legend of the Green Dragon. <br>

<br>
</span><span class='colLtGreen'>
You wake up one day, and you're in a village for some reason.  You wander around, bemused, until you stumble upon the Village Square.  Once there you start asking lots of stupid questions.  People (who are mostly naked for some reason) throw things at you.  You escape by ducking into the Inn and find a rack of pamphlets by the door.  The title of the pamphlet reads: "Everything You Wanted to Know About the LoGD, but Were Afraid to Ask."  Looking furtively around to make sure nobody's watching, you open one and read:<br>

<br>

"So, you're a Newbie.  Welcome to the club.  Here you will find answers to the questions that plague you.  Well, actually you will find answers to the questions that plagued US.  So, here, read and learn, and leave us alone!" <br>

<br>

~Thank you,<br>

the Management.<br>

<hr>
</span><span class='colLtYellow'>1.  What is the purpose of this game?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

To get chicks.<br>

Seriously, though.  The purpose is to slay the green dragon.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>2.  How do I find the green dragon?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

You can't.<br>

Well, sort of.  You can't find her until you've reached a certain level. When you're at that level, it will be immediately obvious.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>3.  How do I increase my level?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Send us money.<br>

No, don't send money - you increase your experience by fighting creatures in the forest.  Once you've gotten enough experience, you can challenge your master in the village.<br>

<br>

Well, you can send us money if you want (see PayPal link)<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>4.  Why can't I beat my master?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

He's far too wiley for the likes of you.<br>

Did you ask him if you have enough experience?<br>

Have you tried purchasing some armor or weapons in the village?<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>5.  I used up all my turns.   How do I get more?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Send money.<br>

No, put your wallet away.  There *are* a few ways to get an extra turn or two, but by and large you just have to wait for tomorrow.  When a new day comes you'll have more energy.<br>

Don't bother asking us what those few ways are - some things are fun to find on your own.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>6.  When does a new day start?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Right after the old one ends.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>7.  Arghhh, you guys are killing me with your smart answers - can't you just give me a straight answer?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Nope.<br>

Well, okay, new days correspond with the clock in the village (can also be viewed in the inn).  When the clock strikes midnight, expect a new day to begin.  The number of times a clock in LoGD strikes midnight per calendar day may vary by server.  Beta server has 4 play days per calendar day, SourceForge server has 2.  Other servers depend on the admin.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>8.  Something's gone wrong!!!  How do I let you know?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Send money.  Better yet, send a petition.  A petition should not say 'this doesn't work' or 'I'm broken' or 'I can't log in' or 'yo.  Sup?'  A petition *should* be very complete in describing *what* doesn't work.  Please tell us what happened, what the error message is (copy and paste is your friend), when it occurred, and anything else that may be helpful.  "I'm broken" is not helpful.  "There are salmon flying out of my moniter when I log in" is much more descriptive.  And humorous.  Although there's not much we can do about it.  In general, please be patient with these requests - many people play the game, and as long as the admin is swamped with 'yo - Sup?' petitions, it will take some time to sift through them. <br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>9.  What if all I have to say is 'yo - sup?'?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

If you don't have something nice (or useful, or interesting, or creative that adds to the general revelry of the game) to say, don't say anything.<br>

But if you do want to converse with someone, send them an email through Ye Olde Post Office.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>10.  How do I use emotes?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Type :: before your text.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>11.  What's an emote?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

</span><span class='colLtWhite'>AnObviousAnswer punches you in the gut.<br>

</span><span class='colLtGreen'>That's an emote.  You can emote in the village if you want to do an action rather than simply speaking.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>12.  How do you get colors in your name?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Eat funny mushrooms.<br>

No, put that mushroom away, colors signify that the character was integral to the beta-testing process - finding a bug, helping to create creatures, etc, or being married to the admin.  (*cough*Appleshiner*cough*)<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>13.  Sup dOOd, iz  it cool 2 uz  common IM wurds in the village?  Cuz u no, it's faster.  R u down wit that?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

NO, for the love of pete, use full words and good grammar, PLEASE! These are not words: U, R, Ur, Cya, K, Kay, d00d, L8tr, sup, na and anything else like that!<br>

<br>

<hr>
</span><span class='colLtWhite'>(Warning, the FAQs below might contain some spoilers, so if you really want to discover things on your own, you'd be better off not reading too far.  This is not a manual.  It's a self-help pamphlet.)</span><span class='colLtWhite'>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>1.  How do you get gems?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

To the mines with you!!<br>

Actually, you can't mine them.  Gems can be found in the forest during 'special events' that happen randomly - if you play often enough, you're bound to stumble across one at some point.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>2.  Why do some people seem to have so many hitpoints at a low level?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Cause they're bigger than you.<br>

No, really, they *are* bigger than you.  You'll be big too someday.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>3.  Does that have something to do with the titles that people have?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

But of course!<br>

Indeed, every time you kill the dragon, you get a new title and return to level one.  So low level players with titles have had opportunities to embiggen themselves.  (see Hall of Fame)<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>4.  Why does that old man keep hitting me with an ugly/pretty stick in the forest?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

You look like a pinata!<br>

It's a special event that can add or remove charm.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>5.  Well, what's the point of charm?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

To get chicks.<br>

Well, actually, that *is* the point.  Visit some folks at the inn, and you ought to be able to figure this one out.  The more charm you have, the more successful you'll be wooing said folks.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>6.  Okay, I saw the man in the forest and he hit me with his ugly stick, but it says I'm uglier than the stick, and I made it lose a charm point. What's going on?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

You're clearly the least charming person on the planet.  And if you're the person who actually *asked* this question, you're also the dumbest. Use a little power of inference, wouldja?  No.  Really.<br>

Okay, we did say you were the dumbest, so: it means you currently have zero charm points.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>7.  How do I check my charm?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Take a peek in the mirror once in a while.<br>

We jest - there's no mirror.  You'll have to ask a friend how you look today - the responses may be vague, but they'll give you a clue how you're doing.<br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>8.  How do we go to other villages?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Take the train downtown.  We're talking downtown.<br>

Actually, there aren't any other villages to travel to.  Any references to them (i.e. Eythgim folks you meet in the forest) only exist to give the game more depth. <br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>9.  Who is the Management?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Appleshiner and Foilwench are in charge of this FAQ,  but if something goes wrong, email MightyE.  He's in charge of everything else. <br>

<br>

</span><span class='colLtYellow'>10.  How did they get to be so darn attractive, anyway?</span><span class='colLtGreen'><br>

Lots of at-home facials, my dear!!  MightyE especially enjoys the Grapefruit Essence Facial Masque.<br>
