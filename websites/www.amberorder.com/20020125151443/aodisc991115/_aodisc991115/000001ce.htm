<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Okay !  Here presented for your consideration are ideas for a series of events that i hope will bring all from the guild and *gasp* let everyone have some fun  :).
<p>
1.  Scavenger Hunt. ---  Ive discussed the format with a few of the guild and what ive come up with for the hunt iiiiis :- 3 Teams of 6, one teleporter to each, one high leveller (for guide purposes) then the only other stipulation that you group with at least 4 people YOU HAVE NEVER GROUPED WITH BEFORE  =).  The aim will be to collect something from every dungeon on norrath which is unique to that dungeon and the prize will be... a surprise.  More on the prize closer to the date   :)   I have no idea on what time limit to give this so send me a tell and let me know what everyone thinks for a time limit.
<p>
2.. Arena ! --- The second event im looking to plan is a fight ... (or 7).  Ive had too many ideas for this to list here but suffice to say it will be fun (information to come closer to date)  ;-)
<p>
3.  Own a Dungeon ! -- Last but not least i propose we take over our very own dungeon.  Something that doesnt take much planning like Paw possibly, or Mistmoore even.  Mistmoore is good because there are plenty of items there for different classes, the mobs are interesting and the castle is a spectacular place.
<p>
4.  I know i said 3 events but ive had a word with Seeny from the Grail Brotherhood and she agrees that a joint AO / GB raid would be a great thing and if enough peeps agree maybe we could go raid Efreeti or something ?  Worth thinking about  :)
<p>
When is it going to happen !?  -  3 weeks or so from now.  Im moving house this weekend and it will take me a couple to get settled but if anyone would like to take one of these ideas and do it before i get back, by all means do  :)
<p>
See you all in game, any questions just send me a tell.
