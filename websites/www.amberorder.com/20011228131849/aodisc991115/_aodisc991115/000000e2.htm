<p>Last night was soooo wonderful!! I want to extend my thanks to all who came and to those who wanted to come but couldn't. I don't think I've had quite so much fun in EQ before and you all made it an amazingly enjoyable night! I'm just sorry I didn't get to pay more attention to each and every one of you. hehe the screen was scrolling so fast most of the time my head was spinning!!! =D 
<p>
<p>
Special thanks go out to those who helped make this such a success!! To Chula and Quesa for performing the ceremony. To Seeny and Draven for standing at Malic's and my sides (was that proper english?) To Maia and Iklyn and Cyst for doing the drinks (and anyone else who provided!!!) and providing fun in the way of pretending to be my pets! hehe To Zarbon for adding the evil flare! 
<p>
<p>
Everyone who attended was so very gracious and your cooperation made the whole event quite enjoyable! 
<p>
<p>
The only hitch during the night was my computer picked the absolutely WORST moment to disconnect me! hehe I hear the jokes about cold feet and fainting were in abundance. 
<p>
<p>
I've posted a copy of the ceremony itself from the log (yes..I did remember to log it!! hehe) on the Erollisi Marr board (on Shards) so I don't bore anyone with it here. 
<p>
<p>
Malic is just wonderful and I am sooo very proud to wear his name and be called his wife. 
<p>
<p>
The fighting was a BLAST..literally!!! hahahaa Gholam is KILLER with that backstab and geesh..that guy sticks like glue when he's on you!! hehe died twice to the sucker. Mavrikk was the provider of the rollar coaster. That spell rocked!!! I was literally screaming with laughter! AGAIN..AGAIN!!! haha It was a lvl 44 AE Wiz spell that blasted all in it's effect straight up into the air about 100 feet or so and dropped them. WHAT a rush!!!! he'd run out of mana and we'd kill him so he didn't have to med so he could do it again! rofl! 
<p>
<p>
Anyway..I know this is very long but I am one happy and tired camper this morning and am about to bust with pride at the wonderful friends I have!!! 
<p>
<p>
*hugs to ALLLLLL of you*
