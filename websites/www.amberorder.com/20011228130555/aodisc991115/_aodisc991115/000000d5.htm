<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Found this from one of my mail lists.  I did not write it.
<p>
-------
<p>
<p>
Following are details of changes introduced with Wednesdays patch...
<p>
PETS
Necro pets have been modified. They will still do the same amount of damage
in melee, but will now give &quot;the finger&quot; to any monk passing by. This
behaviour can be toggled via the &quot;/pet humble&quot; or &quot;/pet arrogant&quot; commands.
<p>
Pets no longer disappear when zoning, however they pretend they don't know
you and immediately befriend the nearest NPC with an abundance of
non-summoned food.
<p>
New pet commands: /pet sit, /pet SIT (all caps), /pet dammit SIT!!
<p>
NPC BEHAVIOR / AI
<p>
If you accidentally give the wrong combination of items to an NPC or the
right
items to the wrong NPC, the NPC will laugh hideously at you and immediately
run to the nearest merchant to sell these items, at which point there will
be no way to re-acquire the misgiven items.
<p>
Pathfinding has been improved in zones such as Mistmoore, Everfrost and
Permafrost. Mobs no longer &quot;appear then disappear, then appear&quot; right in
front of you. Now they simply appear in front of you without any prior
visible evidence of their existence.
<p>
Mobs will no longer be able to hit/target thru walls &amp; doors - instead in
select zones, walls and doors will be considered autonomous NPCs which can
deal damage similar to other monsters in the area.
<p>
WEATHER
<p>
Weather-related haze and reduction of visibility has been increased. A new
gnome tinkering item has been introduced: fog lights, which will increase
visibility by 5% except when being chased by anything undead, in which
case,
visibility will be reduced by 5%.
<p>
Dropped items now have a 25% chance of being swept away during rain storms,
excluding rusty weapons and foraged grubs, which will now litter the
landscape for an extra 20 minutes when dropped.
<p>
A new NPC &quot;Noah&quot; will wander around Norrath, most often in South Karana,
looking to round up two of each creature.
<p>
SPELLS
<p>
New Druid Spells: Ring of Desktop (29th), Circle of Desktop (34th) -
Immediately teleports you to the Windows 98 desktop, thereby aborting
Everquest; in-game action similar to going link-dead. Circle of Desktop has
the same results but affects the entire party. Succour: Desktop was
decidedly
left out as it took three times more time than required to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL
which caused the same effect.
<p>
New Shaman Spells: Spirit of GM (Allows you to run faster than SoW in
opposite direction when asked for assistance)
<p>
New Enchanter Spells: Clarify (automatically makes excuses to other mage
classes as to why you can't cast Clarity on them)
<p>
SKILLS
A new skill has been introduced: &quot;slacking&quot; - Humans, Ogres and Trollsbegin
with a bonus to this skill of 35. It is available to all races. &quot;Slackers&quot;
-
experts in this field will be able to manufacture new game items:
television, la-z-boy recliner, cheetos, remote control - all of which
improve hp regeneration while adding to encumbrance.
<p>
Another new skill: &quot;pimping&quot; is available to all classes except Shaman,
Enchanters &amp; Druids. Experts in this skill will be able to force others
around them to cast Sprit of the Wolf on them at will. Masters of this
skill
may force druids to teleport them far out of their way while thinking
you're
doing them a favour.
<p>
Another new skill: &quot;whining&quot; available to all classes but melee classes
start with 50 skill points, monks start with 60. Masters of this skill have
the ability to root GMs for extended periods of time.
<p>

<p>
I still chuckle at some of these!  ha ha...
