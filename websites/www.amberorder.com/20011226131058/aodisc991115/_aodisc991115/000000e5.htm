<p>Well, I guess it's that time again! I've never been to Kedge, and I really wanna check it out. Most people don't want to go there because they don't have some kind of air source (ie Fishbone Earring), and are afraid of drowning if Enduring Breath runs out. It's also a zone that is somewhat out of the way for the kind of people that would go there (most people of that level would be permanently on Antonica in Guk or SolB) and don't feel like taking the time to get over there and explore. Also, there's hardly anyone ever in the zone, so you have to bring your own party--not find one inside. So lets get some AO people together and go check the place out. There are some nice goodies inside, but I think it'll just be a 'wander around the zone' type thing so we can all get a feel for it, those of us that haven't been there. I haven't been here before, so I'm not really sure what the levels should be, but I'm guessing 35 and up. Also, I'll need people that have been to the zone previously to help me with leading the whole thing (I don't necessarily wanna lead this, I just wanna go =). When's a good time for everyone? I haven't seen many people posting on the board recently, so people may not be reading it any more...I'll try and get in touch with ya all in-game as well. No set time as of now, I wanna leave time to get everyone organized and get as many of our friends to go as possible. Give me a tell in-game or leave a message here...Hope to see you all there when this is all planned out!

P.S. Mages just got the new spell Summon: Waterstone or whatever it's called, has one charge of Enduring Breath...once you use it the mage can summon another one so yer ready to go when it runs out. So if you don't have a Fishbone Earring or some tinkered item or you can't cast Enduring Breath, this is yer best alternative. Fishbones aren't a must. If Xetti can't make it to this I'll drag someone else along =)</p>
