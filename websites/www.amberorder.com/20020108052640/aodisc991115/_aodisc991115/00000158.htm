<p>The reason why I joined the Amber Order was because of everyones compassion to help regardless of their own personal gains.I remeber being lvl one in the dark in everfrost, weaponless and lost. When out of nowhere appeared the great xettiochio.she said she was on the way to permafrost to meet some friends when she just stopped what she was doin.she conjured me an awseome magic weapon and a ultravision necklace, but the kindness didnot stop there. she helped powerlevel me to lvl 6 before she left.Mind you that this is my first character and first time playing.
  This is why the Amber Order left such a huge impression on me as a newbie.helping others regardless of personal gains is what were about, I think. I do agree it would be very impressionable to slay the almighty baddies as a family, but big deal if it needed help.Im sure ALL of us needed help at least once in our Norrathian lives.There is nothing to be ashamed of. Maybe we might need to recruit a couple of high lvl people, but the Amber Order's future is with the young, upincoming players.
  You want a loyal temate, that would die for you, that would stand next to you in combat.your not gonna find such chivelry in new older recruits. you need family for that. Heck, if I could, I would go now and just be cannon fodder for vox, distract her so none of my older brothers and sisters would  die.what would I expect in return? not some aweinspiring weapon or armor, but just a hug and maybe a few rounds of ale.what would some old character want, the LOOTS? your future is here. help us level and I would be honored to join up.
  The loyality does not just begin with me either.
Songoku and Lenur are the bravest people I ever met.They would and have died for me and my group to live.Dorcha spends more time helping others then he does leveling.Fuzzie,Drakkos,Moil, Hobbit, Gnnash, Incantasia, Elionwy. These are just the ones I can remember who show there loyality to the guild and each other.The young in this guild are very loyal and very bloodthirsty. Skip the new recruiting and help us youngsters grow up.You will notice the difference. Then and only then will a True FAMILY slaying occur.Not just a bunch of strangers who wear our tag to say the AO killed vox.
 It is family and helping were about, right???
