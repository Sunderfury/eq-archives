<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>I just read Aralorns post and it got me thinking about my recent experiance at ct.  You see, i figured hunting gators was a good place to get hell level one behind me... and it is ... but, i also have been having a hard time finding groups to hunt with. I have been grouping with Boudin who is now in GB, but very few AO of my level seem interested in forming regular groups. I dont know most of my brothers and sisters and those i do know, i dont see as much as i would like.  Anyway, my idea is for people of approx the same level to do more grouping together.  Use the discussion or event board to announce your intentions and those who are seeking similar adventures will know wher to go.  I hope that this will help us build a stronger, tighter guild, and achieve our own xp and item objectives at the same time.  So, i will be hanging at CT for the next week or so ...at least. If you are close to level 30 and would like to group pls come to ct and hail me.   
I will cross post this on the event board and i hope to see all you thirtysomethings in CT soon.
<p>
Your brother in arms,
Varrus</p>
