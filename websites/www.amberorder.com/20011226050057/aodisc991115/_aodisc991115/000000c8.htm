<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Friends, I once again take my leave from Amber Order
<p>
After serious contemplation, I&#146;ve decided that this simply isn&#146;t the guild for me. It has nothing to do with any of you personally, I enjoy most of your company, and I&#146;ve heard few complaints of my company being too annoying, but there are some, and they are officers, who somehow think that I need to be sanitized for this new PG version of Amber Order. 
This all started innocently enough. I&#146;d heard a few people seeming to lack any sense of formality log on with a &#147;Sup ao&#148; as opposed to a more hearty &#147;Hail Amber Order&#148; or &#147;Greetings AO&#148; or something similar. It bothered me enough that I raised it in guildsay, that perhaps we should have some guild etiquette, and almost immediately got a tell from an officer, who I will not name, criticizing me for my rather  oblique references to smoking a joint now and then, my barbarian risqué jokes, and no doubt numerous other things that simply don&#146;t fit the new PG mold. Well folks, this green haired, 49 year old reefer smoker really doesn&#146;t give a damn what some politically correct yuppie officer thinks of that anymore. It&#146;s obvious that I ain&#146;t officer material in some eyes, and that&#146;s good enough, I&#146;m outta here.
You know, I&#146;ve been AO a long time, and I&#146;ve often been the most vocal of rude, obscene, or selfish behaviour. I&#146;ve belittled people for it, am a master of the vocal flame, and can make life miserable for ks&#146;ers and other idiots that seem to have no manners. I&#146;m frank, blunt, and to the point, and it can make some folks uncomfortable. I&#146;m not about to sugar coat my behaviour, the game is intended for those of us over 18, and you only have to look at the amount of  bare flesh on some of the npc&#146;s to realize that, so if someone is offended that my comments may somehow corrupt youth, then I&#146;ll just take my leave. 
Lock up your grandmothers, Machord is on the loose&#133;..
