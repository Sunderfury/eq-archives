<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>I thought of this during our meeting tonight. A good place to have a guild raid would be permafrost. People level 20 and up can participate, maybe even slightly lower than 20. Basically almost no one goes to perma except to camp items. If we do this it wouldn't really be for experience or items, but just to have a good time. Their might be a chance of both experience and items, don't get me wrong, but that is not why we would do this. Basically I was thinking we try and kill everything in the place that we could. If people are camping areas for items, we let them be. The main purpose of this is to give the whole guild something to do, and get us to do something together. And I think it would be prety cool to be able to say we took back permafrost from the goblins and giants for a few hours. There are so many mobs that usually get left untouched. I know the areas up until the king room pretty well, but am not farmiliar with anything past that.
<p>
I am pretty much volunteering to organize this, but will need help. Basically we need first of all to decide when. This week is really bad for me, I have 4 exams within 3 days, so I would say next sunday at the earliest. (Saturday I might just want to chill and watch a movie or something) So please give dates and times that are good for everyone. If at all possible I would like to get the majority of the guild in on this. Secondly we need group leaders. I guess for now lets shoot for a leader for the 20's, 30's, and 40's. That can be changes depending how many people we get. But I would like to get at least 1 person in each of these ranges who can be a leader. I think that is about it for initial planning. So post what dates and times (times being when you can start and when you would have to leave) you can make it, and hopefully we can have a good time.
<p>
All comments, suggestions, and critisism is welcome and encouraged.
