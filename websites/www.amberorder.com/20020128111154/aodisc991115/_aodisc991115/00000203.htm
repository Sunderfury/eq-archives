<p>Heck no it won't, soon as we drop Vox we regroup an AO strike force and port to lava and nab Efreeti while others acuse each other of ninja'n Vox.  I'll be in Seattle this weekend, but seeing as how Im not going to Ireland anymore I have spring break next week free to do whatever I can get myself into. 
<p>
Only problem with not having non AO in the raid is that some of us have alot of friends, and its hard to tell them no. And there is no way we could have held it as long as we did, without Dergon pulling the all night 18 hours shift in there, that guy busted his hump for us.  And he was a friend that I called in to help me break the King room in Guk and when we left for Efreeti Jarv convinced him to come with.  We could hold the Efreeti as a guild with only guild members, yes.  But it would require Hamm to pull a shift that lasted the whole time we were there, no-doze for Hammy =p  And the last and most important reason is, we are not SotS.  We let others help, and we help others. Not just when it is convient for us, but all the time.  
<p>
Anyway, yes we need more boots, we will always need more boots, and we will get more, don't worry bout that.  Whenever you want to go do it, as long as me, Prae or Zpai are there to lead it, we'll do fine.  You just need to gather the troops up, and I know that everyone who got boots this weekend will volunteer to help others get theirs, I know I will =)
