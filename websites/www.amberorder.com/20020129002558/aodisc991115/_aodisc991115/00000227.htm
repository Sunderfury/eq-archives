1 It will be done on this server for various reasons (mostly cause we and all our resources are here).
<p>
And I did think about the DOT thing. I basiclly decided that since so many classes rely on DOT (particularly the evil spellcasters), that I was not going to suggest or request people to use DOT's early. I guess what Im saying is dont play a character where u are worried about losing a little experience. If your character is low level it does not take very long to regain experience (and clerics may be available). We can suggest early DOT's but that is as far as I will go. This is going to be roleplay to a large extent and why would a Dark elf Necro care if his enemy lost experience when he was slain by a poision spell (which is also arguably their prime battle spell).
<p>
The concept will go something like this. All of the players are either rich, nobility, hired by nobility or some combination thereof. 
<p>
Ressurection is a common spell of the rich in this world making permanent death fairly rare (people take blood samples and such before sending their family/minions out to battle). 
<p>
Thus, soon after they killed in combat no one is surprised when they return from the dead. This also explains why an annoying group of fairly low level evil folks (the Legion of Chaos) can still continue to resist a powerful group such as the Amber Order (and all our level 50 folks). As such, many scenarios are going to be based on accomplishing an objective (as military defeats are generally not lasting).
<p>
I hope that is fairly clear and you can see that I'm going to try to blend the mechanics of the game to the storyline.
