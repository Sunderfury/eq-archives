        <small><small>&#147;I tell you that as long as I can conceive something better than myself
    I cannot be easy unless I am striving to bring it into existence or clearing the way for
    it. That is the law of my life. That is the working within me of Life's incessant
    aspiration to higher organization, wider, deeper, intenser self-consciousness, and clearer
    self-understanding.&#148;</small></small></font></p>

    complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.&#148;</small></font></small></p>

    been looking. Fighting back to back with people you trust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    the ways of the place and how to fend for themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    holds monsters at bay so her fleeing bothers and sisters may escape -- dying to save those
    she loves.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">These are all commonplace events among AO Brothers and Sisters.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To be a part of AO is to be a part of something
    special &#150; something that is greater than the sum of its parts.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To be a part of AO is to share in comradeship and
    love that has spanned over half a decade and multiple on-line games.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Being a part of The Amber Order is an honor that
    brings immeasurable benefits, but also carries responsibilities.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This Code of Conduct is intended help AO member
    and prospective members understand both those benefits and the responsibilities that go
    with them. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">One of the most wonderful things about the AO family is that we can
    help each other learn to become better people while we share and play together. So, even
    as we lay out a Code of Conduct, know that Love, Compassion, and Kindness comprise the
    true Soul of the AO, and the framework that these ideas are hung upon. If your actions
    stem from these ideals then you are a rich person and you will enrich those around you. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">This is what is expected of a member of the AO. This way of life is
    not for everyone. Do you think that it suits you? Decide carefully.</p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong><big><big>The Code of the Amber Order</big></big><br>
        </strong></font>Rules and guidelines are very important in any large organization.
    However, life is very complicated and right and wrong are often a matter of perspective.
    Our Code is intended to give all our members a core idea of what kind of behavior we
    expect of them. They are intended to make our time together more fun and enriching than it
    would be in the absence of these guidelines.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">We will strive to never lose sight of the individual in any
    situation. However, our goal is &#147;The Good of the Many&#148;, or &#147;The Greater
    Good&#148;. In our quest for this ideal, sometimes punishments are necessary to protect<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#147;The Greater Good&#148; and the soul of the
    AO. The Code is as follows:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·</span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">&nbsp; Loyalty - </b>Members of the AO are expected
    and required to be Loyal to their guildmates and guild ideals. One does not have to like
    every member of ones guild, every ideal, or every officer, but loyalty requires that you
    work as best you can within the group. If there are problems or differences of opinion, we
    will deal with them as a guild and accept the decisions of the guild.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">· </span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Responsibility</b> &#150; Our members are expected to
    be responsible for their actions. Our officers have responsibilities to the members and to
    all of Norrath. The responsibility of each member is no less. Take time to help your
    guildmates. We each have our individual strengths and weaknesses. It is each members
    responsibility to share what is best about them, and your fellows will help teach you in
    areas where you are weakest. This has nothing to do with power or level. This has
    everything to do with making our guild greater and more wonderful than the sum of its
    entire fantastic people. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">· </span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Appreciation and Expectation - </b>One must <b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><u>not expect or rely</u></b> on the guild to help
    them in most situations, or give them powerful items. Members must also not expect spell
    casters in the guild to always come help them with some useful spell. Becoming efficient
    and powerful <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><u>is not</u></b> what our guild is
    about. <u>I can not say this strongly enough</u>, as this seems to be an expectation of
    many new members. While your friends may help you when you most need it, or give a gift
    out of friendship and love, to expect such treatment is wrong. One cannot learn
    responsibility, or values, if all is given to them or if they regularly use others. This
    is not what we want our members to learn, or worse yet, to teach others. To succeed in a
    game such as this one has only to enjoy it, and it is even better if in your enjoyment,
    others have fun as well. This can be done at all levels of play, and what you do and who
    you do it with is far more important than what you are wearing or how powerful you are.
    This is easy to forget. Try not to.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">· </span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Passion</b> &#150; While passion is not truly a
    required behavior, it does underlie many a good deed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>If you see something wrong, fix it. If you think that there should be more newbie
    quests or guild events, organize one. If you would like to see changes or new policies,
    promote them. Use your passion; it is a wonderful part of who you are, and what you can
    share with your friends.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·</span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">&nbsp; Profanity</b> &#150; This is an easy one.
    Don&#146;t do it. AO Members will not use profanity or inappropriate language in public.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#147;Public&#148; includes server, zone, and
    Guild Chat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Within private tells or group
    tells, members are allowed to establish agreed upon norms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>However, even in those modes, if someone gets offended, or is obviously too young,
    we expect AO members to apologize and/or adjust their behavior appropriately.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">· </span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Kill Stealing</b> &#150; This one is just as easy
    (don&#146;t do it either). AO Members will not intentionally steal kills.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We recognize that accidents happen, however, we
    will not tolerate members who repeatedly and openly exhibit this behavior.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If at all possible, we suggest coming to an
    agreement with others in the area about how to share the kills.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If someone insists on stealing your kills, call a
    GM and let AO know.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We will try to help
    resolve the situation. When all else fails, walk away and come back another time. The
    thing you are after will still be there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Usually.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">· </span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Assistance</b> - If an AO brother or sister dies and
    needs assistance with body recovery, anyone of an appropriate level and within reasonable
    proximity should come to help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, if
    you die, you must allow the guild time to respond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People
    have gotten upset because they died multiple times trying to recover a body, even though
    help was on the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You must be patient.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you do not have time to wait, leave the body
    and it will be there when more help can be organized or when next you come on. Remember,
    it is a member&#146;s responsibility to help their fellows, but expecting such help too
    much or too quickly is unrealistic and leads to unjustified bad feelings.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">· </span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Cheating </b>&#150; Another easy one (don&#146;t do
    it). AO members do not use Pathing Bugs, Duplication Bugs, or any other kind of cheat.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Amber Order
    Punishment<br>
        </b></font>Sometimes people are admitted into the guild and we later find that they do not
    act in accordance with our rather ethical Code of Conduct. This may be for many varying
    reasons, but if such inappropriate behavior is allowed, our guild ideals, goals, and our
    role in Norrath can quickly fail. As such, even though a guild as truly &#147;Good&#148;
    as the AO must have punishments for when our guidelines are severely broken. These
    punishments include but are not necessarily limited to the following:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">· </span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Reprimand </b>- If an offense is not too great, a
    public reprimand can be issued. This is a repeated public &#147;guildsay&#148; of the
    action to allow other members of the guild to understand what has transpired. Hopefully,
    such behavior will not often be repeated if is publicly condemned.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·</span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> Assigned Quest</b> - This can also be issued for
    moderate offenses. An Assigned Quest is a task assigned by the leadership to the offending
    individual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such quests will be of a nature
    as to help emphasize the importance of the broken code of conduct. This is meant as a
    learning experience.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Generally, Reprimands and Quests will not be used lightly.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A member might receive several private, informal
    warnings or advice from other members or Guild Officers before more formal actions are
    taken.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Symbol">·</span><span
    style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span><b
    style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Expulsion</b> - If a member&#146;s offense is great,
    for example, malicious behavior, or if they do not respond after Reprimands or Quests,
    they can be ejected from the guild.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are
    loving, loyal, and compassionate, but not everyone is meant to be in the AO. We are very
    selective about who we invite, but we do make mistakes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Our cohesive, family atmosphere is important to us and we will not long tolerate
    those who disrupt it. Remember, we strive for &#147;The Greater Good&#148;. This striving
    does it suit everyone&#146;s playing style.</p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial"><big><big>Conclusion</big></big></font><br>
        </strong>So I ask you again, is this for you? This is not a question you should answer
    lightly. We stand for Goodness, Love, Compassion and Kindness. Is that the kind of game
    you want to play? Do you want to be part of a large organization committed to others as
    much as to themselves? Think about it. If you want to join and are accepted, don&#146;t
    forget what you have read here. Live it, breathe it, enjoy it, and share it. And remember,
    we&#146;re all people who play these games for enjoyment &#150; do your share to spread
    the fun, and you will have a much better time yourself.</p>
