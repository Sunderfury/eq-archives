<p>Hi everyone, this message is not going to be in Aphrodity's character, I just put her name there so you would know who this was. :)
<p>
Anyway I have a favor to ask of all of you. Two years ago today my father passed away. Now any of you who have had to go thru anything like this know it is hard. This year has been especially hard on all of us, especially my mother. Her first grandchild was born two months ago and I know that my mom can't help but think how much my dad would of loved being a grandfather. All I'm asking is that you keep us in your thoughts and prayers today...He was a great man who is trully missed.
<p>
Thanks for listening and thank you for your prayers and thoughts. 
<p>
-Joan aka Aphrodity</p>
