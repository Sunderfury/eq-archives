<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Have you ever been sitting at work a couple extra hours to cover for someone who was in a meeting earlier who normally works the graveyard shift?  I am sitting here and my poor little mind begins to wander.
<p>
Here this eve I sit at my sesk listening to the electric hum of a hundred computers and their fans.  
The air is chilled to a perfect 72 degrees ferenheight but my mind races.
I see imagies flash past on the monitors around me as the surfaces are bombarded by electrons.
Are my eyes too being bombarded?  What of the night does it exist in this bomb shelter of a comclave?
Whatn awaits one outside of the reality that is here.  Is anywhere else much the same?
At my home I too have a computer right now cruching numbers looking for signs of life elsewhere.
Billions of gigawatts of electricity all to fuel the information that the world uses on a day to day basis.
What is the real cost of information as it stands.  We can find phone numbers order food place phone calls and find loved ones.
All with but a click of the moust and a few strokes of our fingers.  But what do we really do?
Every action you make on a pc is recorderd perused and either kept or discarded.
Ever person is unique but now becomeing no more than the id stamp on their pricessor.
What are you we ask and the answers we get are.  I am a P3 600mhz with 3 gig of ram and a 90 terrabyte array.
Who are you we ask and the first answers we notice are that we are Microsoft or Linux or Solaris.
The world still turns at the same rate.
People still live and breath together.
Why is it that the information has now become so much more important than the person?
When did the switch get flipped to say the information is more important.
250 pople die.   
How did they die?
It was an airplane accadent.
What caused it.
A bad tailwind.
Can it be predicted.
With more information.
Ahh we need to collect more information.
Do we ever stop to ask who died?
We take the information and forget about it.
Same thing happens day in and day out.
What is the driving force behind real information?
What is the importance of real information?
Hummm I am rambling I know.  I shall leave you now for a while.  Untill my mind wanders so far that I can no longer contain it again.
<p>

The subtle ramblings of Josh.
