<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Hail AO family and friends,
I have been absent from EQ for a while. Longer than expected to be sure. My one week sabatical has turned into a 2 week test of faith.
<p>
I am a Texas Aggie. I attended A&amp;M from 81-84 and was a member of the Corps of Cadets there. The bonfire tragedy this last week has hit close to home. I feel I have lost 12 friends that I will never meet. Being only 2 hours away from A&amp;M, I traveled to see what I could do to help. My help was not needed. The students turned out in the thousands, football players and the local community were united in their sorrow and grief. Students from rival Texas and Baylor universites raced to Aggieland to help and consol. I have never witnessed such an outpouring in my life. I know I will weep openly this Dec. when Silver Taps is played for my missing brothers and sisters.
<p>
A&amp;M is a family and my family is taking this time to heal. Though I could do nothing but watch in silence as the logs were removed one by one, arms comforted, reassuring words and tears flowed. 
<p>
I didnt want to write this as a sorrow filled message, just wanted to ask for your prayers for the lost and the healing.
<p>
Your brother,
Lifecrusher Shadowhound</p>
