<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>It is with a heavy heart that I say goodbye to you all...and please know you will all be missed. The game has become more of a habit than something that I can enjoy...the game has lost it's fun for me, and I can no longer convience myself that it is worth the money. I know that most of you are probally saying &quot;It only costs $10 a month, what is she talking about?&quot; But when you only have $100 to your name, $10 is an awful lot. I have also not been doing to well in my school work and feel that I need to concentrate on that. I hope you all understand, and also know that this is not a break, my account has been cancelled. I wish that you will all keep in touch and understand that this was not something that was easy for me to decide. I love you all and I will keep you in my thoughts, please keep in touch.
