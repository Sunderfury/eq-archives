<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Well, yes, it went fairly well.  considering the danger and complexity of the raid, i think the amount of deaths was kinda low...
<p>
BUT, nevertheless, I think there were still several people who couldn't stay long enough to get boots and need more time to do so.
Would like to see the chance of maybe trying this again either this next weekend or the next.. maybe give some ppl a week break after that.  Alot of sleep lost from it!!!
<p>
Also, if we do reschedule it, let's try just an hour or 2 later this time.  I know bear took off from work early to make it and missed it by about 20 minutes and i barely got on just after the group went in.
<p>
Aside from the time, i think it was well planned but honestly, i think when saturday evening came around and ALOT of non-aoers (no offense to them) joined up, it was mass hysteria with lack of guidance..  Let's work on that before we do it again!
