<p>I dunno what is going on, but for some reason me and Fae had another FG raid just two days after the last one. Just sitting killing bats and we decide to do another one. Heh. 
<p>
Listening to Aralorn's and Khor's advice, we got a much smaller group than last time (about 5 to 6 groups last time), and this time we only had 3 (whittled down to two a bit later). It didn't go so well at first, when not everyone assisted who they were supposed to, resulting in our efforts being spread out over 3 giants instead of concentrated on one, and everyone died or gated. We all got our corpses back, and had a lil extra support. We killed a few FGs, then moved up and attacked the King Tranix set of Giants. All of a sudden, we see 6 &quot;XX creates a shimmering portal messages&quot; and one of the groups is gone. To all our great (and pleasant surprise), the two groups were able to handle THREE Fire Giants at once. Very impressive. Then, as we were medding, all of a sudden 3 Fire Giants pop up and start attacking us. I honestly have no idea how we survived that one. Then we went in the throne room, got one FG alone, then went and killed Warlord Skarlon. I think we did an amazing job when everything went well. Way too many deaths, but most of those were due to some wierd problem. A Mithril Torque was dropped, which went to Voltronos, and Mithril Greaves went to Neen.
<p>
We'll, of course, hold another one of these. Maybe we'll actually announce the next one and plan ahead =)
<p>
Again, great work by all, thanks for coming, and congrats again to my fearless co-leader Faeqen =)
