          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>One
  of the most wonderful things about the AO family is that we can help each
  other learn to become better people while we share and play together. So,
  even as we lay out a Code of Conduct, know that Love, Compassion, and
  Kindness comprise the true Soul of the AO, and the framework that these ideas
  are hung upon. If your actions stem from these ideals then you are a rich
  person and you will enrich those around you. </p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>This
  is what is expected of a member of the AO. This way of life is not for
  everyone. Do you think that it suits you? Decide carefully.</p>
          <p><strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The Code of the
  Amber Order</span></strong><b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
          </span></b>Rules and guidelines are very important in any large organization.
  However, life is very complicated and right and wrong are often a matter of
  perspective. Our Code is intended to give all our members a core idea of what
  kind of behavior we expect of them. They are intended to make our time
  together more fun and enriching than it would be in the absence of these
  guidelines.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>We
  will strive to never lose sight of the individual in any situation. However,
  our goal is “The Good of the Many”, or “The Greater Good”. In our quest for
  this ideal, sometimes punishments are necessary to protect<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The Greater Good” and the soul of the AO.
  The Code is as follows:</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
  style='font-family:Symbol'>·</span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;
  Loyalty - </b>Members of the AO are expected and required to be Loyal to
  their guildmates and guild ideals. One does not have to like every member of
  ones guild, every ideal, or every officer, but loyalty requires that you work
  as best you can within the group. If there are problems or differences of
  opinion, we will deal with them as a guild and accept the decisions of the
  guild.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
  style='font-family:Symbol'>· </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Responsibility</b>
  – Our members are expected to be responsible for their actions. Our officers
  have responsibilities to the members and to all of Norrath. The
  responsibility of each member is no less. Take time to help your guildmates.
  We each have our individual strengths and weaknesses. It is each members
  responsibility to share what is best about them, and your fellows will help
  teach you in areas where you are weakest. This has nothing to do with power
  or level. This has everything to do with making our guild greater and more
  wonderful than the sum of its entire fantastic people. </p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
  style='font-family:Symbol'>· </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Appreciation
  and Expectation - </b>One must <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>not
  expect or rely</u></b> on the guild to help them in most situations, or give
  them powerful items. Members must also not expect spell casters in the guild
  to always come help them with some useful spell. Becoming efficient and
  powerful <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>is not</u></b> what our
  guild is about. <u>I can not say this strongly enough</u>, as this seems to
  be an expectation of many new members. While your friends may help you when
  you most need it, or give a gift out of friendship and love, to expect such
  treatment is wrong. One cannot learn responsibility, or values, if all is
  given to them or if they regularly use others. This is not what we want our
  members to learn, or worse yet, to teach others. To succeed in a game such as
  this one has only to enjoy it, and it is even better if in your enjoyment,
  others have fun as well. This can be done at all levels of play, and what you
  do and who you do it with is far more important than what you are wearing or
  how powerful you are. This is easy to forget. Try not to.</p>

  style='font-family:Symbol'>· </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Passion</b>
  – While passion is not truly a required behavior, it does underlie many a
  good deed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you see something
  wrong, fix it. If you think that there should be more newbie quests or guild
  events, organize one. If you would like to see changes or new policies,
  promote them. Use your passion; it is a wonderful part of who you are, and
  what you can share with your friends.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
  style='font-family:Symbol'>·</span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;

  profanity or inappropriate language in public.<span style="mso-spacerun:
  yes">  </span>“Public” includes server, zone, and Guild Chat.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Within private tells or group tells,
  members are allowed to establish agreed upon norms.<span style="mso-spacerun:
  yes">  </span>However, even in those modes, if someone gets offended, or is
  obviously too young, we expect AO members to apologize and/or adjust their
  behavior appropriately.</p>

  style='font-family:Symbol'>· </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Kill
  Stealing</b> – This one is just as easy (don’t do it either). AO Members will
  not intentionally steal kills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
  recognize that accidents happen, however, we will not tolerate members who
  repeatedly and openly exhibit this behavior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
          </span>If at all possible, we suggest coming to an agreement with others in
  the area about how to share the kills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
          </span>If someone insists on stealing your kills, call a GM and let AO
  know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We will try to help resolve the

  style='font-family:Symbol'>· </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Assistance</b>
  - If an AO brother or sister dies and needs assistance with body recovery,
  anyone of an appropriate level and within reasonable proximity should come to
  help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, if you die, you must
  allow the guild time to respond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
          </span>People have gotten upset because they died multiple times trying to
  recover a body, even though help was on the way.<span style="mso-spacerun:
  yes">  </span>You must be patient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If
  you do not have time to wait, leave the body and it will be there when more
  help can be organized or when next you come on. Remember, it is a member’s
  responsibility to help their fellows, but expecting such help too much or too
  quickly is unrealistic and leads to unjustified bad feelings.</p>

          </b>– Another easy one (don’t do it). AO members do not use Pathing Bugs, Duplication
  Bugs, or any other kind of cheat.</p>

  style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Amber
  Order Punishment<br>
          </span></b>Sometimes people are admitted into the guild and we later find
  that they do not act in accordance with our rather ethical Code of Conduct.
  This may be for many varying reasons, but if such inappropriate behavior is
  allowed, our guild ideals, goals, and our role in Norrath can quickly fail.
  As such, even though a guild as truly “Good” as the AO must have punishments
  for when our guidelines are severely broken. These punishments include but
  are not necessarily limited to the following:</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
  style='font-family:Symbol'>· </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Reprimand
          </b>- If an offense is not too great, a public reprimand can be issued. This
  is a repeated public “guildsay” of the action to allow other members of the
  guild to understand what has transpired. Hopefully, such behavior will not
  often be repeated if is publicly condemned.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
  style='font-family:Symbol'>·</span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>
  Assigned Quest</b> - This can also be issued for moderate offenses. An
  Assigned Quest is a task assigned by the leadership to the offending
  individual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Such quests will be of a
  nature as to help emphasize the importance of the broken code of conduct.
  This is meant as a learning experience.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Generally,
  Reprimands and Quests will not be used lightly.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  advice from other members or Guild Officers before more formal actions are
  taken.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
  style='font-family:Symbol'>·</span><span style='font-size:7.0pt'>&nbsp; </span><b
  style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Expulsion</b> - If a member’s offense is
  great, for example, malicious behavior, or if they do not respond after
  Reprimands or Quests, they can be ejected from the guild.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We are loving, loyal, and compassionate,
  but not everyone is meant to be in the AO. We are very selective about who we
  invite, but we do make mistakes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our
  cohesive, family atmosphere is important to us and we will not long tolerate
  those who disrupt it. Remember, we strive for “The Greater Good”. This
  striving does it suit everyone’s playing style.</p>
          <p><strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Conclusion</span></strong><b><br>
          </b>So I ask you again, is this for you? This is not a question you should
  answer lightly. We stand for Goodness, Love, Compassion and Kindness. Is that
  the kind of game you want to play? Do you want to be part of a large
  organization committed to others as much as to themselves? Think about it. If
  you want to join and are accepted, don’t forget what you have read here. Live
  it, breathe it, enjoy it, and share it. And remember, we’re all people who
  play these games for enjoyment – do your share to spread the fun, and you
  will have a much better time yourself.</p>
