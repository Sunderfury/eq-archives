<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Would just like to clarify a couple things I said, before this turns into a string 4 miles long. =) One one hand I see your point, I really do, there sould be a certain ammount of respect given to the Guild at all times, and I think that the &quot;Officers&quot; should be examples of this. Whenever I log on my usual greeting is &quot;Hail AO Brothers and Sisters, how is everyone today?&quot; I dont expect 100 messages about how everyone is doing, its just more or less a message that I am on, if you need my help call me. I do totaly understand how you feel about the &quot;respect&quot; one should issue to the guild, I mean heck im getting commisioned as a Lt soon and some of the underclass men are having trouble with the whole Army sir/mam thing for officers. But the way I look at it is, they are learning and they will catch on soon enough. If people in guild want to use &quot;Hail AO&quot; and give Amber Order &quot;respect and revrance&quot; then so be it, if everyone uses it then perhaps some of the newer guys will catch on too. But I must remind everyone that in the end, it is just a game, when you shut off your computer at night, or early morning, it stays on the server. Which is exactly why I am always giving away PP and items, it's just a game and if I can make soem 9yr old boy bounce around the house happy because I gave him a magical sword, well then I enjoy that. Just last night I sold a pair of DWB's to a guy I had played with a couple times for 1200pp so I could turn around and give the 1200 to a guy who was buying a mirthil bp and needed 1200 so he would have enough. I had never even seen this guy before, but you should have seen the way he bounced around on the server after getting his bp. Thats what I enjoy most about the game, the &quot;ramdom acts of kindness&quot; that make people have fun. Everyone enjoy's the game for their own reasons, and I think that our goal should be for everyone to have fun, just don't miss the forest for the trees. There are so many big reasons to enjoy the game, try not to get caught up in the details, is my point I think. This game is so fun and you can have tons of fun working and playing together for common goals, but remember that when you log your pp and your items don't go with you, and that in the end we are really here to have fun and help each other.</p>
