<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">An odd decision out of the blue – Time to Retire.<BR><BR>This will be long.  If you don’t care to read the whole thing.. read the next paragraph and the last one at the end. A copy of this is in both the public and private sections on the ED board.  I did this because a lot of the people it’s written too don’t have access to the private sections.<BR><BR>I woke up this past Monday and while in the shower I was trying to think of a way, as I often do,  to try and improve my declining raid attendance. In this past year, as a lot of normal real life things have been asking for more of my time, my raid attendance has slowly declined.  Each time this would happen I’d review all the things I had going on and cut something to allow me more play time.  It was time to do that yet again as my attendance drops to the lower 40% and it just hit me like a load of bricks.  It was just time for Selene to retire from Everquest.<BR><BR>Over the last 2 years especially, I have sacrificed so many things in my real life that I didn’t hardly realize.  I used to go to the gym 3 days a week and run 6, I used to go out with my girlfriends on weekends and lately I’ve only been doing that about once or twice a month.  I used to read, go to the beach, take vacations, keep my house clean, cook killer meals, be more active in church,  and a ton of other things that I’ve slowly sacrificed and didn’t’ even know it.  About the only thing I feel I haven’t sacrificed yet was time with my son and husband (well not much anyway) .. though it would soon be getting to that point.  There just wasn’t much more I could cut and keep my attendance up.<BR><BR>As I struggled with this dilemma, I was trying to determine what was the one thing that took up most of my time that I didn’t need so I could play more Everquest.. and then it hit me.. Everquest itself.  By giving up just this one thing.. I could do so many other things that I have given up over the years and still have spare time for other new things.  As I slowly pondered all the things I could (and should) be doing besides playing EQ.. I realized that it was the right choice.<BR><BR>Don’t get me wrong.. I don’t regret any of my past EQ time or experiences,  But I won’t miss the game any (just the people) and I won’t be coming back.  I’ll never play a game like EQ again that asks so much of my time and requires me to be online and playing X amount of time for whatever reason.  I’m a sucker for duty and obligations and for years as a cleric I felt both pull at me greatly in this game.  I felt that if I didn’t log in and participate that I was letting down my guild, my team my friends.  The game I started years ago for fun slowly transformed it’s self in to a form of work.  It was amazing to step back from EQ for a few days and see how much fun I wasn’t having.. and I didn’t even know it.  This past week since my choice to retire has been 7 days of the most liberating feeling I’ve had in a long time.  In and odd way.. I feel like I’ve quit my second shift job but getting twice the pay.  I’m very happy and my family is too.<BR><BR>I don’t think I’ll ever be able to give up computer games totally.. nor should I, It’s a good healthy hobby in most cases and in moderation…but the games I play in the future will be on my terms and if I don’t’ feel like playing it a few days or weeks.. no one will suffer for it.. <BR><BR>I’ll cherish the friendships I’ve made here forever and I hope we stay in touch.  When you think about it.. In five years… I’ve spent more time playing EQ then I did attending and graduating from collage. That’s a bit startling.  However, in both I met people I’ll remember and keep in contact with the rest of my life.  And I’ll always remember my glory years in ED.  What a way to sum up 5 years of Everquest huh?  I was able to experience 4 expansions with you guys and you truly made my last 2 years of Everquest the best ever. (despite the fact that the last 3 expansions have been the worse ever with the next one looking even worse =/.)<BR><BR>What will I do with my account?  The one question everyone always wants to ask but doesn’t.  The answer is.. I don’t know for sure I’m open to ideas if you have them. There are a few pending factors that will ultimately decide what happens.  I have a lot of friends from lower guilds or no guild at all that are a lot less fortunate then I was and will never have a shot at joining a high level guild or seeing half of what I did.  I’ll likely just split up my cash in 100k chunks and make a lot of people really happy that have no way to make that kind of cash on there own until I only have about a million left for safe keeping. As for Selene herself…  I can’t bear the image of her in any other guild then ED and I have a standard for her that I just can’t give her to just anyone..So.. she will be gifted to my real life friend that’s currently recruiting named Melek if he makes it in the guild.  In this way I hope to keep the hard work that not only I put into her.. but each of you guys did too.. Where it belongs…in the guild and with someone that I know will treat the account right.   If he doesn’t make it in.. that makes things a lot harder to decide on and I guess I’ll cross that bridge if I get there.  In that case who knows…I’ll likely just make one final trek to the Plane of Growth and sit down at the feet of Tunare forever.  <BR><BR>There is no way I can do a person by person list of all of the people that effected me during this game.  It would be in the hundreds... However I would like to do something a bit different and  take a few mins to give a few messages to groups of people, some of them are already gone =/ but I remember them none the less… in the order in how I came in contact with them.<BR><BR>To the members of  The Virtuous:  The first guild I was in and helped found along with Nikar and two other friends. I won’t ever forget our times in EQ or UO.  To this day my fingers still bleed from all the skullcaps we made.  Perhaps The Virtuous will live again in another universe.<BR><BR>To the members of Oathsworn: I thank you for taking me to the “next level” and getting me started on the large scale dragon raids.   It was my first loot I ever got from a dragon (Vox) that I controversially sold within days of getting it (it WAS mine wasn’t it?) that allowed me to have enough cash to buy a dozen other items that helped my toon much more then any one item from a dragon could have. (and lasted longer)  I still had enough left over from this to finance my “buy low sell high” plan that kept Selene well funded for the rest of her life.. Leaving me today with millions I could never naturally spend.<BR><BR>To the members of  Numinous:<BR>I fondly remember my short time in Numinous.  I’m sorry that my departure seemed like such a traitorous act. I frankly was just tired of certain individuals holding the rest of the guild hostage with there threats and I felt that ultimately it would be the downfall of the guild.. I met a lot of people in Numi that I still consider friends to this day.  I was very proud of being a member.  This was one of only 2 guilds I ever saw on TM that could always “do more with less”  I truly did hate to leave. Numi made me a better person and a better player.<BR><BR>To the members of old school B la c k  C o m p a n y:<BR><BR>(this message board was modified to automatically change the words B C and B l a c k  C o m p a n y  to “BZ”  I do not refer to them in this condescending way but the board forces it.  Just know I don’t mean it that way.)<BR><BR>Black Company was another guild that took me to a new level of gameplay.  I joined BZ around the time they where doing fear and hate raids and stayed with them until about the end of Shadows of Luclin.  I learned most of my high level game mechanics from them.  I saw some of the best and worse Everquest as a game had to offer.  I saw the joy of winning (mostly) new content and working together as a team to get things done.  Sadly I also saw the high level greed and corruption that goes along with this level of play.  As odd as it might sound.. the best part of the game was the tense races with ED. The thrill and excitement of winning the race (or perceived race) and the agony of defeat just made the game that much sweeter. All in all a good experience except for the last 6 months under the rule of a certain Shaman I’ll not even honor with a name.<BR><BR>To the members of Enlightened Dark:<BR>What can I say?  Words can’t really describe my time in ED.  I’d say ED took me to yet another level of gameplay but truly it was more like another game entirely.  I still remember grouping with Slott and Fist in BoT just a few weeks after Planes of Power came out.  I had already left BZ by then and was enjoying the guildless life with no politics, no corruption etc...  For some reason Slott asked me if I wanted to group with him for a bit.  To make a long story short.. I think he was a bit surprised that some guildless no name cleric was able to keep him alive while trying to recklessly charm some npc for “uber” amounts of exp and that I even had access to the zone so quickly.  We did this off and on for a few days to a week and then a week or two later he sent me a tell right out of the blue “have you ever considered joining ED?”<BR><BR>That actually took me by surprise. And I once again pondered the reason why I was not already a member of ED.   See.. years ago.. when I was like level 20ish I had a run in with a group of ED in the Najinia J-boots room that so soured my taste of the guild.. that I promised myself I’d never ever join a group of people like that no matter what.  Many other experiences after that time cemented that feeling even more. So that when Greldon offered me a spot on the cleric team back in 2000 I turned him down.. not once but 3 times over the course of 3 months.  Probably the only thing in my entire EQ career that I regret, and it taught me a valuable lesson about blind, blanket stereo-typing.  I’m not sure how joining ED at that time would have affected my EQ playing experience, but I do know things would have been vastly different had I not been so blind and joined ED 2 years before I eventually decided I was wrong.<BR><BR>I finally saw the mistake of that promise and broke it.  It took me another 2 weeks or so to tell Slott I’d give it a try and my time in the best guild on TM was born.<BR><BR>I joined ED not for the loot, but for the places I could go.. the parts of the game I wanted to see and play in.  Loot as far as I was concerned didn’t matter so long as I could perform my job.  So far in Black Company I was able to do that despite the few drops I was allow to have after the leader, officers, there friends and there friends friends didn’t’ want it.  I soon found out that ED raids would press my limits to the extreme as far as skill and gear was concerned.  I loved it.  I know I’ll probably never be a part of something like that again… but I’ll also never forget it.<BR><BR>To the ED leadership/officers:<BR>After being a member of BZ my faith in EQ guild leadership was extremely jaded and at an all time low.  Despite being an officer in every guild I was ever in except BZ and ED I just had this feeling that every guild was doomed to be corrupt and tainted with greed.  I had this illusion that the leadership of a guild was in place to serve and was responsible for the welfare of it’s members a whole.  It took me a long time to give ED leadership the benefit of the doubt after BZ.  But I have to say I have NEVER seen ANY set of leader/officers that are more fair and trustworthy then the ones in ED past and present and I know that’s the reason for the guild’s success.  These people truly do look out for the guild as a whole.  Choices made are made to further the guild and not cater to any one person or group of persons.  Favoritism is near non-existent.  The loot system is the best that there could be and it works… but more important then anything.. It’s all about progression and what will further the guild.  I thank you for allowing me a chance to be a part of the guild and inviting me in so long ago.  You guys are the best.  Keep it up.  I know it’s a thankless job but I’m telling you now.. Each of you do an incredible job.  (and you can’t call it brown nosing now.  Grins nothing in it for me to gain anymore =)<BR><BR>To the ED healing team:<BR>The kinship I feel with you guys is amazing.  I always felt at home in the healer channel.  I’m sorry I won’t be there anymore to lend a hand and work together to keep everyone alive and well in the guild.  But I know there will be others that come behind me to take my place.  We already have a few new faces lately that show promise.  I wish you all the best and will miss you guys.<BR><BR>To the TS crew:<BR>Nothing seemed to bring you closer to a group of people in a game like this then being able to hear there voice.  In joy or anger, frustration or disappointment.  It helped to bring a new level of immersion to the game.  In a freak accident where my husband started talking in MY teamspeak channel a few weeks ago while I was cooking dinner.. we where able to finally figure out why I always sounded so garbled and he sounded perfectly clear.  Maybe I’ll pop back in one day for the last time so you guys can know what I sound like without a chewed up microphone cable that I suppose was rolled over one too many times by my chair.  (I have a new one now and it works great!)<BR><BR>To my sisters:<BR>You know who you are.  It’s what I’ll miss the most.<BR><BR>To all others on the TM Server:<BR>I had the opportunity to meet and play with some amazing people that where not a part of any of the “top five” guilds.  One of my secrets of preventing “burnout” for me was to go out to other parts of the game, hide my guild tag, put on really old gear from the bank and play with pickup groups just for fun.  This allowed me a varied play experience, the chance to meet new people and to spice things up a bit.  When I did this I had a lot of fun and created some friendships that I otherwise would have missed out on.  It also gave me a different perspective and showed me just how lucky I was to be a part of ED and how large of a gap exists in this game.  <BR><BR>It was particularly funny when some of you would start talking about ED in group and not even guess I was a member.  This happened more times then you might guess.  Despite what most of you think.. ED is one of the friendliest and fairest guilds I’ve ever been a part of.  They are not out to get you.. or your guild.  They don’t sit around and plot out how and when they can steamroll or “gimp” your spawns or triggers.  The topic of other guilds and what they do, where they are etc rarely comes up.  I know it might sound crazy but the truth is.. ED just plays the game and isn’t out to get anyone.<BR><BR>Anyway, there are just so many good and fun players out there in TM that are what I consider “Unrecognized talent.”  Eather you just never had the time to join a “high level” guild or didn’t want too.  The belief that if your not in the “top three” guilds then your nothing is just false.  You guys keep it up and Don’t’ let someone else tell you how to play…. play the game anyway you want.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>The End<BR>So I hang up my “click stick” and wish you all the best.  For over 5 years I have enjoyed the game called Everquest.  For someone that used to buy a new game a month playing one for 5 years is unheard of.  The people that made this game at the start where some truly talented people. I really enjoyed raiding with the ED crew pressing the game to it’s limit and seeing/doing everything.  I wont’ forget any of you. Maybe I’ll see some of you guys again in another game someday.  But for now.. I’m going to enjoy Real life and take pleasure in all the things I’ve been missing the last 5 years.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">Take care Selene, you were always great to chat with in game and one of the more kind people in the healer channel when I would offer my help and what not <IMG SRC="/Forums/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">  So thanks for making me feel welcome when some others didn't.  I know what you mean about cutting things out of your life to increase raid attendance and all of us who have quit pretty much felt that way as far as I know.  I myself have been having one of the best summers of my life socially as opposed to last summer when I was a hardcore raider.  So get out there and do the things that make you happy, live a life of fewer regrets.  Good luck!<BR><BR>-Jeff
