<B>General Membership information:</B></P>
<P>Must play hardcore, at least 5 days a week, 5-11 e.s.t. is our normal raid time.
We are a no nonsense guild when we raid. There are 36 or more other people depending
on you to be on time, at the correct location. Must have a good reputation
on the server. If you are controversial or into drama, please look elsewhere. 
Must be patient and able to follow instructions. Must have a desire to defeat
the hardest encounters in the game of EQ! We are a raid guild, and that is
what we do, so if this play style is for you, feel free to contact one of
our officers or a member and they can point you in the right direction.

<p><b>The steps/requirements for joining ED are as follows:</b>

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>1.</b></font>
Start by grouping with members or friends in the guild. From there ask your friend
in the guild to get you invited on some small raids. Start small! Dont ask to come
on a huge raid as your first introductory raid. These battles require very precise
planning, strategy, and execution as well as compensating for things such as lag, etc.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>2.</b></font>
You should be level 60 and have at the minimum 18 AAXP. We very rarely will
accept people who are under level 60. Occasional exceptions are made, but not
often. The nature of EQ at high levels requires high-level players. If you have
any questions, feel free to message an officer listed on the character/member
section of this web page.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>3.</b></font>
Be patient. ED very seldom will invite someone after they have been on one or two
raids. Sometimes it takes weeks, sometimes it takes months and no two candidates
can expect to wait the same amount of time. It is just the way we do things.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>4.</b></font>
If you are in another guild, we will not invite you (to ED) until you have been
out of that guild for some time, a week or two at the minumum. We do not encourage
guild jumping.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>5.</b></font>
<font color=red><b>DO NOT</b></font> expect loot for 3 months after joining ED.
Even if you happen to be the only Paladin at a raid, do not expect to receive by
default the pally loot that drops. We expect people to earn their stripes, so to
speak. Enlightened Dark distributes loot on a Merit basis <font size=1>(some
exceptions are made in which case the item in question is "randomed" for, this
is decided by the officers present)</font> If you do not agree with this type
of system, then do not even bother trying to join.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>6.</b></font>
Please have proper resist gear for poison, disease, magic, fire, and cold, as
you WILL be expect to have appropriate resists on raids requiring them.  100 should be
an absolute minumum for each resist, 200+ is preferred.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>7.</b></font>
MUST KNOW HOW TO LISTEN TO AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS... this means if you are
told something by the leader of the raid, do it. Period.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>8.</b></font>
Know your way around, by level 60... you should know how to get from place to
place. If you do not know, there are maps online available all over the place,
print them out and use them. <font color=red><b>DO NOT</b></font> expect us
to lead you around on a leash.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>9.</b></font>
Be on frequently. Enlightened Dark is an active guild, if you join our ranks you
should be someone who plays a lot. We are not saying that you cannot have a
life, but we are a guild of "EQ" junkies, and if you are invited it is because
we need you to be on for raids and such. If you are looking for an online
chat guild, or family love-dovey type shit, well then, look elsewhere.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>10.</b></font>
If you are invited, you play this class as your primary character. If you
decide to start or pursue an alt-character, do so on your free time.  At
raids you are expected to be present with the class we invited, since it is a
class we needed! If you decide to change characters all of the sudden because
you just used this class to join ED, you will find out you are no longer in ED.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>11.</b></font>
Have a solid connection, the faster the better. We are facing more and more
the problem that people on raids are going LD all the time. If you know this
happens to you frequently, then sorry, but a LD character does not help us at
all.  Have a solid non-winmodem 45k+ connection or ISDN/DSL/Cable.

<p><font color=#ffcc66><b>12.</b></font>
Have the basic equipment needed to function in the high-end game:
<UL>
<li>Have keys to Howling Stones, Sebilis, Skyshrine, and Veeshans Peak <font size=1>(We
can possibly help you with multiquesting the Trak's Tooth part of the quest)</font>
<li>EB item, Invis item, See-invis item, and Gate item (for melee in case you
get stuck somewhere), be it potions or whatnot.
<li>Carry the day-to-day materials you need (food, water, bandages, reagants, etc).
While officers will often help with the costs of reagants, do not expect them to
procure them for you.  Come prepared!
</UL>

<P>One final note, if you join this guild with Loot as your priority, you
will be disappointed. We play the game for FUN. Loot comes as a by-product
of all our hard work, not as the reason for our efforts....
