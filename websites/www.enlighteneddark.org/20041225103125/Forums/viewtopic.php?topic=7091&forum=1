I tried taking 2 Motrin IB tablets 45 minutes prior to my workout &amp; my hamstrings still gave me some trouble. (20Lbs.x10, 20Lbs.x8, 30Lbs.x6, 30Lbs.x4) It usually happens either on the 3rd or 4th set if I slow down the speed at which I do the rep.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">hrm interesting - have you tried some Romanian deadlifts?  These are a really good exercise for hitting the hammies &amp; hip flexor - something most people overlook.  It's basically like a straight legged deadlift only you dont go as far down so you can handle ALOT of weight.  Because you are lifting so much it really helps your ligaments and bones develop, it's more of a compound exercise than leg curls too, so more GH is released.<BR><BR>Here's some more info on it<BR><BR><!-- BBCode auto-link start --><a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/issa63.htm" target="_blank">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/issa63.htm</a><!-- BBCode auto-link end --><BR><BR>My ZMA from the states finally arrived btw, i'm just taking 4 caps a bit before bedtime, will see how that goes.  I got my creatine too, and thats going really good, i'm having to drink a ton of water to keep hydrated, and my appetite has increased.  I think i will stay away from the pro hormones for the time being - i was hoping that IGF or HGH would become mainstream type supplements, but HGH isnt alot of use after your growth plates have closed, and its very expensive too, unless you take the homeopathic formula which doesnt really do anything.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif"> I do my workouts at a gym. The guy who owns the gym is the one that is training me. The first 11 weeks that I started working out, I was doing 3 sets of 11 reps on all of the exercises(though I had less exercises on the schedule) 3 times per week(Mon., Wed., Fri.). <BR><BR> I would never use a boflex for the simple reason that the resistance doesn't stay constant throughout the repitition when compared to using free weights. The only good thing that I see with a boflex is that it works your stabilizer muscles more. Other than that, I feel I'm better off just paying the $250.00 per year for gym membership where I'm able to consult with a trainer. <BR><BR> If you're a beginner, you're better off spending at least a year in a gym(if possible) with a trainer so you can master the reps quicker. Some of the exercises that beginners have trouble with from the start are the ones targeting the back muscles such as Rows, Pulldowns, etc., because they tend to use their arms more. Its always good to have a trainer helping you out with proper form/rep execution. When you go with the boflex, you have to follow a strict program specifically taylored for that machine, which isn't the best thing for newbies like myself. <BR><BR><BR> Ghark, I just use the Andro-100 Poppers. I think one of the main things that's helping me out with my gains is diet. I take in a lot of complex carbohydrates(oatmeal, wholewheat bread, spinach, antipasto salads, cauliflower, broccoli, fruits, etc.) in the mornings to noontime. I only take the creatine 1 time 45 minutes prior to my workout in the late afternoon. <BR> I'll have to try those exercises you mentioned, because leg curls just don't seem to cut it. <BR> Btw, I seem to have gained another 2 pounds. =p

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">well ive been lifting weights consistantly since i was 13.<BR><BR>at the moment im 6'2 210. maxxing out on free weights i can do about 280x2. but then my arms are like spaghetti. i have the bulk of my muscles but im going for those stabilizer type muscles because..well it looks stupid without definition.<BR><BR>wash board abs are hard as hell to get for me. Ive got a little now but i cant get them really defined because i have no-way to add resistance to my crunches/sit-ups. i do about 200 a night. But i figure with the bowflex i can add say? 40lbs to my nightly routine with the ab work.<BR><BR>I have a 300lb free-weight set in my room and it works great.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif"> Brimstonee, if you're looking to define your muscles, heavier weight isn't the answer. You don't need to buy more weights. Some of the things you need to do are: <BR><BR>#1. Modify your diet appropriately. You're not looking to put on more mass, so you need to change it. Reduce calorie intake, eat fat in moderation, eat 4 to 6 small meals per day, cut back on sodium(salt), consume most of your complex carbohydrates in the morning, drink plenty of water(1 gallon per day, or up to 2 gallons during hot weather, and know your dieting limits. When it comes to protein, stick to lean meats(turkey, fish, etc.).<BR><BR>#2. For your weight training, you want to lower the weight(50%-55% of your 1-rep max.) and increase the number of reps on each set. A good example would be 3 sets of 11 or 12 reps on each exercise(some of the other exercises require higher reps such as shrugs, calf raises, etc.). <BR><BR>#3. Include cardio exercises in your program, but don't do it every day, and not for longer than 30-45 minutes or you'll end up burning yourself out. Your goal is to burn the excess fat that is covering your muscles. Doing cardio exercises will help in this(especially if you do it in the morning prior to eating). The definition is already there, you just need to remove the overlaying fat in order to make it more visible.<BR><BR>#4. Doing more will NOT bring about quicker results nor be of much help when it comes to defining abs. If you're spending more than 30 minutes on abdominal exercises, you're wasting your time. A good routine would be: <BR>5 sets of Crunches to failure(crunch &amp; hold for 2 seconds on each rep)<BR>5 sets of Lying Leg Lifts to failure<BR>5 sets of Side Crunches to failure(crunch &amp; hold for 2 seconds on each rep)<BR>2 sets of Crunches to failure(&quot; &quot;)<BR><BR> You want to reach failure on each set. Alternate the sets(i.e. do a set of crunches, then do a set of lying leg lifts, then a set of side crunches, etc.). If needed, add weight to your crunch exercises so you're not spending too much time on each set. You want quality, not quantity.<BR><BR> I wouldn't worry too much about stabilizer muscles, especially if you've been lifting weights for years. If you're going with the boflex, you still want to go with less weight/higher reps. Just don't go &amp; buy it for the simple reason that you can lift most of the weights you already have at home. Remember, you're going to be working with less weight for definition, so you won't be using as many weights compared to when you were doing a strength/mass routine. <BR><BR> Total Gym? I wouldn't get it simply because it uses your body weight as part of the resistance. All of those machines(i.e. Boflex, Crossbow, Total Gym, etc.) have a learning curve to one extent or another and take time getting use to. They're also limited in what you can do with them. I still think working with free-weights is better, but that's just my opinion. Everyone's body is different &amp; responds differently. Some could get better results from those machines, provided they're willing to take the time to learn. I just think its too much of a pain in the ass. heh

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">Brimstonee are you able to buy some more plates for your free weight set?  I honestly wouldnt waste my money on another gym set when you can do almost all exercises with free weights and a barbell/plates.  I get frustrated with my gym set sometimes because it's more limiting than having a gym membership with access to lots of machines, but you can get very creative with a basic set - try this page <!-- BBCode auto-link start --><a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/exercises.htm" target="_blank">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/exercises.htm</a><!-- BBCode auto-link end --><BR>- you can do a search for what muscle you want to workout and it lists ALL the exercises you can do for that muscle group with dumbells/barbells.  <BR><BR>Also to get washboard abs you probably already know this but working your abs wont necessarily burn fat around your mid section - fat loss happens for your whole body or not at all, you cant burn fat in an isolated area with specific exercises.  So basically follow Snaeke's advice and do some cardio =)  My abs are pretty undefined too - my genetics mean i got a big belly compared to my frame, but i generally am too lazy to do anything about it =P  <BR><BR>Also if your working out the abs, avoid those twisting crunches, those can be bad for the lower back - and remember that your abs are just like any other muscle group, they grow bigger with increased resistance so doing high reps isnt necessarily the answer (not that i'm one to preach!).<BR><BR>If your looking for a good exercise that's similar to using bands, try doing a bench press with chains on each end of the bar - the higher the bar goes the more resistance you get 0_o<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">pretty good question actually - in my first few months i often wondered just when the weights would stop going up, because for a few months there i was using more weight every session for the shrugs in particular, and also for lat pulldowns and deadlifts.  It really comes down to a few things.  Effort, form, and beginner gains.  <BR><BR>By effort i mean, if you tried really really hard you could probably lift alot more than you currently do for a few of your exercises (not all of em) - the only way of knowing which ones you are gimping yourself on is to experiment - i often wondered where my deadlift would plateau at when i was doing about 120lbs and adding like 5lbs a week.  I just got mad one time and put like an extra 50 lbs on the bar and within one week i had gone from 150lbs to 250lbs, just from getting a pissed off attitude and putting everything into it. For compound exercises like squats &amp; deadlifts you will find you can lift alot more than you think. <BR><BR>Thats where form comes in though, i really dont recommend doing what i did until your totally up to speed on the form of your exercises, and gradually increasing your poundage is gunna mean you got excellent form when you do reach your platea.  The other thing, is that even though you can probably lift alot more weight on your compound exercises, your gunna get good gains because your starting your program,  and only your genetics can determine when it's gunna stop growing like mad =)<BR><BR>So to answer your question, i dont know!  Personally, I got insane growth till about 6 months, then it has just been steady.  Who knows though, you might be the next Lou Ferrigno.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">heya max.  I was thinkin about your question temp and i just came up with a bunch of questions myself such as your priorities etc - if you wanna focus on MA and just use bodybuilding to add some functional strength you should possibly just hold some light dumbells while doing various form routines - it's part of what bruce lee did and it worked for him.  He also lifted some iron as well, doing exercises like good mornings, squats, bench press etc.  <BR><BR>If your wanting to pack on some beef and do martial arts on the side try a routine like Snaeke's, but keep in mind your gunna have to buy a home gym or fork out for a membership.  If you buy a homegym start with a bench set and a good barbell with about 60-80kg of weight.  Work up from there.<BR><BR>Either way your gunna need to eat a ton, aim for 1.5gm of protein per kilo of bodyweight, and try not to do too much cardio after a workout cuz you will burn muscle (up to 10 mins is ok cuz it gets rid of the lactic acid).<BR><BR>If your just gunna stick with the dumbells for now, the best exercises with those would be bicep curls - start out with about 10kg i would say, dumbell press - start with 15kg on each side, you'll probably have to do these on the floor until you get a bench, and tricep presses - try for 20kg.  Doing crunches on the swiss ball is one of the best possible ab exercises btw, make the most of it.<BR><BR>check out the form for those exercises on the bb.com website under exercises.<BR><BR>Dunno if this helps though, i dont know how strong you are already so maybe you can do alot heavier than what i suggested.  Doing any workout will help though, so just crank up the weight as you get stronger.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">Ok that helps a bit =)  What you wanna do is two things, make sure whatever exercise you do is fairly high reps, this will help you burn a bit of fat, as an example - 2-6 reps is for str, 4-10 is for hypertrophy and 8-15 is for toning/fat burning and putting on a bit of muscle.  I still dont know how strong you are, but to find out how much you should lift just find a weight you can handle with perfect form for 15 reps and stick with that until you feel like you are ready to move up.  Keep in mind you will be hella sore whatever weight you start with for at least the first few weeks (muahaha).<BR><BR>If you wanna get rid of some frustration, thats easy - just vent your frustrations during your weight lifting =)  Weightlifting will make your tendons stronger, so you can handle a stretch better, but it wont really make you more flexible - your MA should take care of that though.<BR><BR>Weightlifting will increase your bone mass btw, so should help with that leg =)<BR><BR>Good to hear you got a barbell btw, they are much more usefull than dumbells - the three best exercises are deadlift, squat and bench, and all use a barbell.  Now you just need a bench and later a squat rack.  GL with the workouts man.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">i wouldnt recommend the 2nd part of the clean and jerk man, the part where you shoot one foot forward and the other back and raise the weight up - if you mess up your gunna hurt yourself, or drop the weight and put a hole in the floor.  To do those you really need to be at a gym and be using a weight set that has bumpers so you can drop em.  With the snatch you arent dealing with that much weight and its a pretty simple exercise (providing form is good).  During a deadlift you can keep your legs straight if you like, or bend em - it doesnt matter - the important part is your back.  If you dont bend your legs much just use less weight - it will workout your hammies more.<BR><BR>It's about the same price for plates here, burns a hole in your pocket but at least you got em for life.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">lookin good man, i would change only a couple things.  Drop the flys and replace them with leaning forward dips, and also deadlifts are going to work your back as well as your legs, so try and have a fresh back if your going to include them in your leg day.  Another thing - be careful when doing the upright barbell row not to raise the bar too high, the higher you go the more chance of wear and tear on your shoulder.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif"> Yo Tempz, disregard that email I sent you. I've found what I was looking for. heh nevertheless, I had to go through so much bullshit &amp; probably spend more money than I needed to. I swear our medical systems here in the US are designed to milk either the individual people, the insurance companies, or both out of as much money as possible, heheh. <BR><BR> Hey Ghark, I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but forget about Andro Poppers and any other &quot;Andro&quot; or &quot;legal&quot; growth hormone products. I've been doing a lot of reading up on this stuff. In order to get any kind of results with it, you have to take like 5+ times the recommended dose(that would be 10 or more Andro Poppers throughout the course of the day). At those levels, the same side effects as with most anabolic steroid use become problematic. Basically, with this product, the side effects vs gains when compared to some of the other anabolic steroids(unstacked) is worse, not to mention, more expensive. One of the reasons you have to take so much of it spread out during the day is the active ingredient in Andro breaks down too quickly in the body to be effective.<BR><BR> Quite frankly, I think a lot of these legal growth hormones are worse than steroids(except for the 17-alpha alkaloids such as Dianabol, Anadrol, etc., which damage your liver). heheh, believe it or not, I think Norway is one of the few countries that actually has growth hormones banned yet anabolic steroids remain legal.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">yea i didnt want to diss the PH's cause that wouldnt be smart considering i'm no expert in them and have never taken them, but from what i've read i'm 100 percent sure now i wont ever take them.  The effect you are after when taking them is a boost in testosterone, and because you are taking them orally most of the product is broken down in the liver, and can cause damage to you in the process.  The other side effect is they will lower your natural production of test.  I think anyone that is too worried about there test levels should see a doctor who knows there shit about these things, and if needed get HRT which may include a gel, patch or injection.  If your levels are already normal, you are taking all sorts of risks boosting your manjuice.  (note to zzt: different to manbutter)

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif"> Ghark, the stuff in Andro Poppers is suppose to work on the theory that enough of it gets absorbed through the mouth &amp; enters directly into the bloodstream(which really isn't the case). The Andro that ends up being swallowed is destroyed in the stomach before even reaching the liver. <BR><BR>The only Steroids that directly damage the liver are the 17-alpha alkaloids which are taken orally. Nevertheless, long term use and/or high doses of &quot;any&quot; steroid can damage the liver &amp; kidneys.<BR><BR>heh, history has proven time &amp; time again that dumbasses, morons, the uneducated(i.e. those who just use roids without any research or study) and steroids don't mix. Most bodybuilders fall into the &quot;dumbass&quot; or &quot;moron&quot; category since they tend to believe that with the proper protection &amp; safeguards, they can get away with taking high doses and/or running cycles for months non-stop without doing any significant damage to their bodies. They tend to forget that all of the other &quot;protection&quot; drugs(Nolvadex, Proviron, etc.) they're taking to keep down the side effects isn't making things any easier on the liver &amp; kidneys either. They seem to have a problem with understanding that there's no &quot;safe&quot; way to continuously use steroids regardless of how they're cycled or how much is used. At one point or another, it comes time to pay the piper. =p<BR><BR>Boosting your testosterone levels isn't a problem. Its &quot;how much&quot; you're boosting it &amp; for &quot;how long&quot; is the problem. Some fail to take into account that when you're boosting Test levels, you're also going to end up boosting estrogen levels. Now during the cycle it won't be a problem(unless od'ing), but after the cycle, those elevated estrogen levels become a problem due to the fact that Test levels are dropping since the administration of steroids has ceased. Hence the reason why some roid users end up with gynecomastia(or &quot;bitch tits&quot;), limp dick, and a few other &quot;unwanted&quot; side effects. <BR><BR>Steroids have a highly anticatabolic effect by reducing the catabolic effect of the body's own hormone, cortisone. When taking steroids, the steroid molecules block the cortisone receptors so that the cortisone produced by the adrenal gland cannot attach to the receptors, thus remaining for the most part deactivated. The body reacts by producing additional cortisone receptors so that, in the meantime, the unusually high amount of cortisone receptors in the blood can finally do their job. Now guess what all of that excess cortisone does when a steroid abuser terminates the cycle? It rushes to the cortisone receptors to form a molecule/receptor complex and transmits to the muscle cell the following message: break down amino acids. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't this translate into &quot;muscle loss&quot;? =p <BR> Basically, if they don't continue pumping all of that crap into their system, most of the &quot;steroid gains&quot; they made will be lost. <BR><BR> This is just too much work having to research all of this stuff for a one time thing, which is why I'm opting to do it with a doctor. Based upon what I know now, 200-250mg of injectible Testosterone Enanthate every 5 days for 8 weeks is the treatment that I'm looking for(or something similar) but I'm waiting to see what my doc says. Afterall, I'm just looking to strengthen my lower back with minimal injury risk &amp; without &quot;bulking&quot; up. The most I would gain from such a cycle is 15 pounds, no side effects &amp; no catabolic effects post cycle. Maybe a pimple or two, but that's about it. =p<BR>
