Let me give you guys a free clue here: SQA (Software Quality Assurance) is your friend - I mean, come on, it's BLATANTLY obvious you guys test jack shit about your product before rolling things live...you might want to spend some of that new cash you'll be receiving on some real SQA folks, your players would greatly appreciate a slightly less buggy game.  Then again, I'll be surprised if that's the case, after all, your bottom line probably needs some more padding.  Here's our favorite two bugs from yesterday:<br><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="News/26032002AoWBig.jpg"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="News/26032002AoW.jpg"></A><br><br><A HREF="News/26032002GlyphBig.jpg"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="News/26032002Glyph.jpg"></A></P><br>Yup, Kael crashed just seconds before AoW died so we lost some killer loot (At least we were spared the pain of knowing what loot we lost) and then we had the famous Ssra-basement-pathing-from-hell bug where the Glyphed ported up to us prepping for the Creator after a Z-axis buff bug hit the guild that was fighting him in the basement.  At least we scored a few kills in the last few days: Vindicator a few times, Statue (when he respawned, thanks crash), AoW (when he respawned, thanks crash), Tormax (when he respawned, thanks crash), Yelicrap, Creator, Glyphed, and a few Rhags.  Probably forgot a few mobs too...we've been busy =)<br><br>-Volx<br></font></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table><br><br>
