Due to a freak crash of the Nexus (people with agro ending up at the zone line, instead of their bind.)... The Emperor warped down to the zone in of Ssra, and pummeled many unsuspecting adventurers. We managed to get a cleric camped out in the Emperor room, and he was ressing the dead back, while the Emperor was playing at the zone line. We were thinking "cool, lets whack him at the zone in! " when a kindly GM showed up and sent the Emperor home. Well, this of course killed us all who were ressing in his room, and ruined our chance at the spawn that night. After an hour of wrangling with the GM, we were too tired to even try him again, if the zone was reset. So... we do the Emperor on Monday. <br><br>Special thanks to the Black Company guild who was present in Ssra and was very cooperative in our pursuit to have the zone respawned so we could continue our Emperor Raid. Thanks guys.<br><br>On to other news. We took a break from Vex Thal this weekend, due to everyone being dissapointed it wasnt balanced for Risk vs Reward. We pretty much farmed Ssra to gear up some newer people, killing multiple Cursed, Hp, and Arch lich spawns. I think we got at least 1 Creator in there also. Sorry no picts or loot reports, you just gonna have to wait til next time!<br><br><br>Ok I lied, here are a few pictures, non game related..<br><br>Someone needs to talk to Bazerker's girlfriend!<br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/hookers.jpg"><br><br>and I am not even going to comment about this one....<br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/nudy.jpg"><br><br><br>-Naz<br> </font></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table><br><br>

The new UI looks pretty cool, I havent had the chance to really check it out in detail due to the time it took to download the patch. Whew, what a bottleneck. I was told there were 250+ people checking out the new Bazar at one point, so maybe this will be a boon to the craft skill people on the server, a place to set up shop and sell their wares. Anyway... On to the raids. <br><br>I appologize first of all, for no pictures, due to time constraints, so here is a summary of the day. We pretty much cleared all of Ssra, including the Emperor. We were anxious to see the changes to the Vex Thal key first hand. Thanks to the new Power Sources being No Drop and Lore, there will not be the problem of these going to people who didnt earn them the hard way, by killing the Emperor! Loot from the Emperor was pretty weak, with 3 weapons dropping. Congrats to Gerhalt, Slott and Volx for their new toys, and also to Zuez for the rare Wizzie spell, Garrisons, or Rend2 as some people call it. Thats about it for the day peeps, look for more Vex Thal over the weekend as well as a run at the Vulak ring!<br><br>-Naz<br></font></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table><br><br>
