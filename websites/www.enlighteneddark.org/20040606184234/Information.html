<font color=#ffcc66><B>General Membership Information:</B></FONT>

<P>Must play hardcore, at least 5 days a week, 5-11 e.s.t. is our
normal raid time. We are a no nonsense guild when we raid. There are
50 or more other people depending on you to be on time, at the correct
location, and prepared to tackle whatever may come your way. Must have
a good reputation on the server. If you are controversial or into
drama, look elsewhere. Must be patient and able to follow
instructions. Must have a desire to defeat the hardest encounters in
the game of EQ! We are a raid guild, and that is what we do, so if
this play style is for you, feel free to contact one of our officers
or a member and they can point you in the right direction. We are not
a lovy-dovy family guild - those guilds are appropriate for some
folks, but not for us.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>The steps/requirements for joining ED are as follows:</B></FONT>

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>1.</B></FONT>
Start by grouping with members or friends in the guild. From there
ask your friend in the guild to get you invited on some small
raids. Start small! Don't ask to come on a huge raid as your first
introductory raid. These battles require very precise planning,
strategy, and execution as well as compensating for things such as
lag, etc.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>2.</B></FONT>
You must be level 65 and have at the minimum 200 AAXP. We very
rarely will accept people who do not have the AA and never for those
under level 65. The nature of EQ at high levels requires high-level
players. If you have any questions, feel free to message an officer
listed on the Roster section of this web page. Some exceptions for AA
points are made, based on the needs of the guild for certain classes.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>3.</B></FONT>
Be patient. ED very seldom will invite someone after they have been on
one or two raids.  Sometimes it takes weeks, sometimes it takes months
and no two candidates can expect to wait the same amount of time. It
is just the way we do things. Not all recruits become members, you may
raid with us for weeks, and for whatever reason not be invited.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>4.</B></FONT>
If you are in another guild, we will not invite you (to ED) until you
have been out of that guild for some time, a week or two at the
minimum. We do not encourage guild jumping.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>5.</B></FONT>
<font color="red"><B>DO NOT</B></FONT> expect loot while being a recruit or for 3 months after joining
ED. Even if you happen to be the only Paladin at a raid, do not expect
to receive by default the pally loot that drops. We expect people to
earn their stripes, so to speak. Enlightened Dark distributes loot on
a Merit basis If you do not agree with this type of system, then do
not even bother trying to join. We do not do DKP. We do however track
raid attendance and this is posted for all members to view.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>6.</B></FONT>
Please have proper resist gear for poison, disease, magic, fire, and
cold, as you WILL be expect to have appropriate resists on raids
requiring them. 150 should be an absolute minimum for each resist,
200+ is preferred (UNBUFFED). Make sure you have all basics, such as
food, drink, and any reagents you might need to do your job. The guild
helps with the cost of gems for guild use.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>7.</B></FONT>
<font color="red"><B>MUST KNOW HOW TO LISTEN TO AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS...</B></FONT> this means if
you are told something by the leader of the raid, do it. Period. A
'consent' hotkey is a must.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>8.</B></FONT>
Know your way around, by level 65... you should know how to get
from place to place. If you do not know, there are maps online
available all over the place, print them out and use them. <font color="red"><B>DO NOT</B></FONT>
expect us to lead you around on a leash. Figure out in advance the
travel time it will take you to make a raid on time - nothing pisses
off folks more than late guild members.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>9.</B></FONT>
Be on frequently. Enlightened Dark is an active guild, if you join our
ranks you should be someone who plays a lot. We are not saying that
you cannot have a life outside EQ, but we are a guild of "EQ junkies",
and if you are invited it is because we need you to be on for raids
and such. If you are looking for an online chat guild, or family
love-dovey type shit, well then, look elsewhere. If you fall below our
set standard to "inactive status" you will be removed from the guild,
no questions asked, until such a time as you can become active
again. This may or may not involve recruiting again. Each situation is
different.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>10.</B></FONT>
If you are invited, you play this class as your primary character. If
you decide to start or pursue an alt-character, do so on your free
time. At raids you are expected to be present with the class we
invited, since it is a class we needed! If you decide to change
characters all of the sudden because you just used this class to join
ED, you will find out you are no longer in ED. Playing alts is
<font color="red">extremely LOW priority</font> - improving your primary toon should always
come first and foremost. Getting loot for alts is not done. There may
be occasions when a rot item is available, but don't expect it.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>11.</B></FONT>
Have a solid connection, the faster the better. We are facing more and
more the problem that people on raids are going LD all the time. If
you know this happens to you frequently, then sorry, but a LD
character does not help us at all. Have a solid non-winmodem 45k+
connection or ISDN/DSL/Cable.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>13.</B></FONT>
<font color="red"><B>You WILL die frequently</B></FONT>. The mobs we fight can 1 round anyone, and
frequently hit for 3000pts per attack. Some classes, such as
Enchanters, Shamans, Warriors and Clerics die <font color="red"><B>OFTEN</B></FONT>. You will lose
experience. If you cannot handle this, we don't want you. We don't
want to hear your bitching about it either. If you are a new member,
do not spam guildchat. If you have a creative idea, send a tell to an
officer or a veteran member, and it can be relayed through the chain
of command.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>14.</B></FONT>
Must have PoP flags up to the Elemental gods.

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>15.</B></FONT>
Have the basic equipment needed to function in the high-end game: Must
have EB item, Invis item, See-invis item, and Gate item (for melee in
case you get stuck somewhere), be it potions or whatnot.  Carry the
day-to-day materials you need (food, water, bandages, reagents,
etc). While officers will often help with the costs of reagents, do
not expect them to procure them for you. Come prepared!

<P>One final note, if you join this guild with Loot as your priority, you
will be disappointed. We play the game for FUN and to WIN. Loot comes
as a by-product of all our hard work, not as the reason for our
efforts....

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>Current Classes being Recruited:</B></FONT>
<BR>- Beast Lord (1)
<BR>- Clerics (unlimited =)
<BR>- Necromancer (2)
<BR>- Wizard (1)

<P><font color=#ffcc66><B>- Nazlug GL of Enlightened Dark</B></FONT>
