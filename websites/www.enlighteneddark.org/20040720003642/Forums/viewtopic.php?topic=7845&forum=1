<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif"> Hey Ghark, I think I've finally put together a routine that I like. The time I was spending on Mon/Thurs, Tues/Fri routines were getting way too long(i.e. 1 &amp; 3/4 to 2 hrs long). heh, and I still wanted to add on more exercises, so something had to be modified. Here's what I came up with: <BR><BR>MONDAY:<BR>CHEST <BR>Flat Bench x10/x8/x6/x4 <BR>Inclined Bench &quot; <BR>Decline Bench &quot; <BR>Pek Dek &quot; <BR>SHOULDERS <BR>Shoulder Press(dbells) x10/x8/x6/x4 <BR>Lateral Raises(dbells) &quot; <BR>Standing Deltoid Raises x10/x8/x6 <BR><BR>TUESDAY: <BR>BICEPS<BR>Curl Bar x10/x8/x6/x4 <BR>Reverse Grip Curls &quot; <BR>Hammer Curls &quot; <BR>FOREARMS <BR>Underhand Grip &quot; <BR>Overhand Grip &quot; <BR><BR>WEDNESDAY: <BR>LEGS <BR>Leg Presses x10/x8/x6/x4 <BR>Leg Extensions &quot; <BR>Leg Curls &quot; <BR>Calf Raises x15/x12/x10 <BR>Hip Abductions x15/x12/x10 <BR>Hip Adductions x15/x12/x10 <BR><BR>THURSDAY: <BR>TRICEPS <BR>Skull Crushers x10/x8/x6/x4 <BR>Pushdowns &quot; <BR>Weighted Dips &quot; <BR>One-Armed Cable Pulldowns &quot; <BR>TRAPS <BR>Shrugs <BR><BR>FRIDAY: <BR>BACK <BR>Pulldowns x10/x8/x6/x4 <BR>Hammer Pulldowns &quot; <BR>Hammer Rows &quot; <BR>Bent-Over Rows &quot; <BR>Back Extensions &quot; <BR>Reverse Crunches 3 sets of 12 <BR>Kick Outs 3 sets of 6 <BR><BR>SATURDAY: <BR>CARDIOVASCULAR <BR>Cycle/Treadmill 30 minutes <BR><BR>With this routine, I can hit each muscle group really hard. Notice how I've set it up so that I have 2 days in between Chest/Shoulder routine &amp; Tricept routine, and Curls/Forearm routine &amp; Back routine. Push/Pull(Legs)Push/Pull. I take a 1 minute break in between each set &amp; about 1 &amp; 1/2 to 2 minutes between exercises, plus a 5 minute warmup &amp; 5 minutes stretching pre-workout. So now I'm spending about an average of 1 hr each day in the gym. Not bad compared to how long it was taking me before that.<BR><BR>I think I'm going to stick to this routine for about 12 weeks, then switch over to doing 3 sets of 11 reps for 12 weeks. After that, I'll switch back again. heheh, my weight is up to 180 lbs. =) <BR><BR>Ghark, you ever been to a public fitness club &amp; had some of the women stare at you? That shit really annoys me. heh, its nice attention, but I go there to workout, not pick up on women. =/ I recently switched gyms since the old one doesn't have as much equipment(some of it is rather old, rusted, and worn). I like the new one better since it is bigger &amp; has more available equipment(no waiting in line), but there's more people that go to it, especially women since they have quite a few treadmills, cycles, pilates/aerobic sessions, etc. <BR><BR><BR><BR>&quot;Hey mate, another 20 lbs and you would make a good &quot;before&quot; photo!&quot;<BR><BR><BR><font size=-1>[ This Message was edited by: Snaeke on 2003-12-09 12:18 ]</font></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">Just incase you wanted some critiques on your workout. Why dont you throw in some bent knee deadlifts on leg day or maybe some lunges? Since it seems your deglecting your hams which make up a good deal of your leg to get you a fuller look. And how many total sets are you doing on shoulders. I notice your pyramiding after chest on shoulders. After all the press you should maybe go with a shoulder press first 6/8/10 since since your front delts and sides should be semi warmed up. Pyramiding is a waste of time if your pyramiding with same weight every week or same amount of reps. Also why isolate your bi's and tri's there so small of a muscle group you could work them with either maybe chest/tri , back/bi. And put shoulders on a seperate day with cardio since shoulders are a small muscle group. And for your back routine take out the pull downs start off with pull ups then the HS pulldowns maybe? then go for heavy rows unless your already yolked and dont need the size on your lats and a bigger spread along your back. That is all =) Takes me 1hr 30min max to do routine im on 5'6 185lbs holding 12-13%bf leaning up to 175 so ill be ready for summer early, or I can only hope.<BR><BR><BR>Okra da Veggie </FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif"> Thanks for the critique Okra! =) <BR><BR>One thing you have to remember when it comes to weight training is what works for you may not work for the other guy. I just started lifting back in May of this year. For the first 12 weeks I was doing 3 sets of 11 reps on each exercise every Mon/Wed/Fri and wasn't doing as many exercises. Then I switched to a split routine Mon/Thurs push exercises &amp; Tues/Fri pull &amp; leg exercises. <BR><BR>The reason I came up with this particular 6-day routine is so I can hit my triceps &amp; biceps hard while also being able to do the same with chest &amp; back. Granted, tri's &amp; bi's are smaller muscles, but they're very important when you're trying to increase bench, pulldowns/pullups, rows, etc. because you're using those secondary muscles when working the larger muscles. <BR><BR>I'm not too worried about my hamstring muscles at this point and don't want to end up overworking them since I've had some slight problems with them in the past. The hamstring is a small muscle. The normal strength ratio of hamstring to quadraceps is 1 to 3(which is where I'm at right now). No need to overdo it. <BR><BR>When it comes to deadlifts &amp; other such compound exercises(especially the ones that are more demanding on the lower back), I'm holding off on changing over to those for maybe another 6 months. That's why I've dedicated an entire day to back muscles. Eventually, I'll work myself up to a routine where I'm doing less exercises &amp; doing 5x5 or 4x6 on each with some added compounds.<BR><BR>Every week, I'm always increasing the weight on something or throwing in negative reps. So no need to worry about my routine becoming stale. =) Usually I'll keep increasing the weight on 2 exercises until I plateau, and then I'll start increasing the weight on 2 other exercises, etc. <BR><BR>1 hr. 30 minutes is a bit long. I try to keep the time down to about an hour or less. <BR><BR>-Snaeke<BR>&quot;Hey mate, another 20 lbs. and you would make a good &quot;before&quot; photo!&quot; <BR>

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif"> Tempz, I've heard of super sets before, but never done them. Imo, I think its almost like doing higher reps with lesser weight. You're probably better off just alternating week by week, like doing a different curl type first each week and going heavy on that particular one and dropping the weight a little bit on the others. This way you'll be able to hit a different part of the bicep harder each week thereby promoting more &quot;overall&quot; growth of the muscle as opposed to hitting the same area the hardest each week. Super sets do the same thing, but again, you won't be hitting each area as hard since you're combining sets(i.e. higher reps).<BR><BR>I've never heard of the &quot;matrix&quot; thing you've mentioned. Would be interested in hearing more about it. <BR><BR>-Snaeke <BR>&quot;Hey mate, another 20 lbs. and you would make a good &quot;before&quot; photo!&quot;</FONT><BR>

When you do an exercise like the bench press that works not only the chest, but also smaller muscles, one of the smaller muscles might fail before your chest is fully exhausted. By doing a chest isolation exercise beforehand, you can fatigue your chest so you can do bench presses to chest failure, which is what you want.<BR><BR>Muscle Priority Training (I &amp; A) - Training your most underdeveloped muscles first, so as to subject it to the maximum possible effort. If you have a weak body-part you want to improve, train it first in your workout, before you begin to fatigue.<BR><BR>Pyramiding (B, I, &amp; A) - When using multiple sets for a given exercise, doing your first set with less weight for more reps, gradually increasing the weight and decreasing the reps over the remainder of your sets. This allows you to gradually warm up a muscle group, preparing it for the resistance to come in the next set.<BR><BR>Supersets (I &amp; A) - Working opposing muscle groups in back-to-back fashion, taking as little rest as possible in between sets. Alternating sets between opposing muscle groups - such as biceps and triceps/chest and back - greatly increases intensity. When you train one muscle group, the other is recovering (sometimes even being stretched) as you complete the set. With two muscles or muscle groups being worked, more blood is pumped into the area.<BR><BR>Tri-Sets (A) - Doing three sets in a row for the same body-part with as little rest as possible in between sets. Three exercises in a row more thoroughly exhaust the muscle. This training technique is so demanding that it should only be done on occasion, and is more often used by bodybuilders in their pre-contest training. It is not optimal for muscle building.<BR><BR>Set System Training (B, I, &amp; A) - Simply doing more than one set for each exercise. This is the opposite of high-intensity training, which involves performing one set per exercise. Often, the first couple of sets aren't enough to fatigue your muscle.<BR><BR>Giant Sets (A) - Doing 4-6 exercises for the same body-part with as little rest between sets. Giant sets are used to create overwhelming stimulation to a body-part and totally exhaust the muscles involved. This technique should only be used occasionally as your body needs time to recover from this level of effort. This type of training is used more for muscular endurance and calorie burning then for putting on muscle size.<BR><BR>Instinctive Training (A) - This involves experimenting with your workouts and paying attention to how your body reacts to certain types of training. The fundamentals of bodybuilding training are the same for everyone, but we are all unique. The further along you get in your training, the more you have to fine tune your workouts to suit your needs. It takes time to develop this &quot;feel&quot; and have this type of knowledge. Whatever you are used to is going to feel best for you, but you have to figure out what really produces the best results for you and make adjustments accordingly.<BR><BR>Compound Sets (I &amp; A) - Alternating two exercises for the same muscle group, taking as little rest as possible between each set. Each same-bodypart exercise fatigues the muscle involved in slightly different ways, so doing two exercises in a row with little rest inbetween achieves a deeper level of stimulation and muscle pump. Keep in mind that I do not personally agree with the rest aspect of this principle. That is just how Mr. Weider presented it.<BR><BR>Staggered Sets (I &amp; A) - Training smaller, slower-developing bodyparts like calves or forearms in between all sets for your major bodyparts. Arnold Schwarzenegger relied on this principle early in his career to develop his calves. He would do a set for chest, back or shoulders, then he would do a set of calf raises while his major muscle group was recovering for the next set. He'd then alternate sets for the working bodypart and calves. His calves got plenty of time to recover in-between sets and by the end of his workout, he would have subjected them to as many as 15-20 total sets of various calf raises.<BR><BR>-JH</FONT><BR>

Oh, did i mention i work out at home? =P<BR><BR>Your routine is lookin good, your gettin beefy man - 180lb's is awesome.  I think you got the right idea with keeping your workout times at an hour max - working at a high intensity is more important than duration imo, and anything over an hour and your really gunna cook your immune system.

It just depends on what I've got to do.  It can vary from 45 minutes to upwards of 1 1/2 hours.  If I'm working my upper body (Mon, Wed, Fri), then it's about 45min - 1 hour.  If it's my lower body (Tues, Thurs, Sat), then it's generally 1 hour+.<BR><BR>I will say that I am a leg press/extension freak.  Am currently squatting 620lb for my burnout/max set with a normal 450~ for warmups and 550 for sets.  My bestfriend who is 10x more into working out than I am, calls me &quot;Captain Insano&quot; when it comes down to my leg routines.  Course, he's the Jesus Christ of upper bodies, IMHO....but man...this boy needs to get a tan...he's so white, he lights up dark rooms when he takes his shirt off....course, if you make fun of him, he can beat you to death with his pecs.

<FONT COLOR="#BCF5FE" face="sans-serif">i havent tried the matrix system myself tempz, but there are two things that come to mind if you wanna get matrix on your chest - one is the ROB (rest only briefly) approach - the name says it all.  The 2nd is that you could incorporate some board/bench machine work.  The boards go ontop of your chest and the more you use the higher the bar stops - so its good for practising the top half of your lift, the machine would let you set the pins halfway up, so you could practise the bottom half of the bench.  That's the closest chest workout i can think of to your bicep matrix routine.<BR><BR>oh yea, you could mix in some narrow grip/wide grip too.<BR><BR>So the routing might be<BR><BR>narrow grip:<BR>8 reps full rom<BR>8 reps on smith machine<BR>8 reps boarded<BR>8 reps full rom<BR><BR>then do the same with regular width, then wide grip.<BR><BR>Throw in some ROB, and you'll be chucking up your lunch hehee.<BR><BR><BR><font size=-1>[ This Message was edited by: Ghark Maull on 2004-01-04 04:14 ]</font></FONT><BR>
