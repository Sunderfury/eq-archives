<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Hafta congratulate you guys on killing RF for your cleric friend today, musta been a proud moment!<BR><BR>I have never spoken publicly regarding events similar to what happened today, because, quite frankly, it's all part of the game, everyone gets burned at one time or another, but you simply went too far.  I have played this game longer than probably 90% of you guys and i have never seen anything like this.<BR><BR>I dunno if you guys do things like this simply because you can (I could honestly care less who was in the right according to GM rules concerning RF), or if it pleases you to be COMPLETELY disrespectful to others?  Clearly those of you who were there to kill RF do not have consciences or you would have done what was right.  However, now a cleric who did absolutely NOTHING to merit receiving his epic has it now.  <BR><BR>Maybe it's just a few of you who give an extremely bad name for your guild, but regardless, the actions of a few demonstrate the actions of the whole.  Sure, you've done some nice things for others, but the greater percentage of the things you guys do to/for others is bad and it's those acts that are remembered the most.  Those of you who DO have consciences i hope this weighs on you heavily, this was one of THE most disrespectful things i have ever witnessed in EQ.<BR><BR>Again, congratulations to your undeserving cleric friend.<BR><BR>Kavis Khaan<BR>Officer, Sanctus Arcanum<BR><BR><BR><BR></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">Ragefire account. <BR><BR>Greetings all. I have been asked to post to this thread of what happened so you can understand more what happened. This is a full accounting condensed as much as I can for ease of reading.<BR><BR>Qalwen was camping Ragefire again for the second week. (disaster from numi the week before but has nothing to do with this issue).  We knew Ragefire was due within in a few hr that morning so we moved 4 groups of hunters to the orb to hunt and wait. He spawned and somehow he got early agro from other mobs in camp. We fought and killed the mobs and he also was killed causing early spawn of the dragon. <BR><BR>With this we battled but was not fully ready for the dragon. He had heavy losses. A lot of us were bound in the zone and returned back to the dragon. It looked nasty as most of our members at the orb were dead and he was eatting our wizards and the Qalwen that was bound at the orb site (dead loop issues).<BR><BR>I had Gweni (my cleric) and my self pull ragefire from camp to get that area safe to rez and get organized. Ragefire was at 30% hp. With DA/DB and ping pong between my 2 chars and some help from our Wizards Sinea and Qilin we moved him along the wall to OT picking at him and loosing members along the way. Why move him to OT ? we needed him out of camp and I also had a full + group at OT inc to finish . As I had him about there I lost Gweni to the dragon. Guild was back to fighting strength at orb but so was the group at OT .. I had him bounced around along the wall and figured OT was closer so I finished to try to get him to OT.<BR><BR>Out of my side I saw a warrior and players close to OT and in dancing with dragon I thought they were ours. AS Vila nimbly pranced around the dragon I realized that it was not my hunters but ED hunters. I sent a /t to zrazzt at that time and asked what the heck. I continued to cast on Ragefire and had many dots in him. He was close to death so I dropped 2 more moonfires trying to get the kill in hopes I would finish the kill. (Iustus has logs of this engage and battle where I was pulling and you guys tagged)<BR><BR>I was summoned for the last time and killed. I did us ooc to say SA had ragefire and I was kiting as well as Let us have rage fire. Long before I died.<BR><BR>Yes, we were bad crippled. But we were NOT dead at the time you engaged. Yes one hobbit kiting a mob around the zone my be hard to miss when your in a hunting frenzy. Kiting is a leagal hunting pull and way of killing a mob. I died under the dragon well after you guys engaged. I was actively on the dragon personally when you tagged him from me.<BR><BR>I was then told by the GM that it was a mess and since I did not live to see Ragefire die then he would not call it a KS.. What the heck with that ?..had no idea that you had to live to the end of a ks issue to validate your spot. He did say he did see engaged but since I was dead it did not matter and he logged on me.<BR><BR>Yes we never should have been this disorganized on this hunt. It should never have gotten to the point we needed to kite the dragon as a desperate act to get him finished off. But we did and things happen. With that we NEVER should have had him tagged off me. He was in active agro and hunt with me. Yea druids kite sloppy at times when we have summoning dragons on us. Yes he summons all that get close. I really had no idea I had him summoning ed members from what I was told later but I had my hands full talking to guild running a bot and me Kiting a dragon as a desperate move to finish him off.<BR><BR>If ED had bothered to look and see why the dragon was still at 30% hp and why he was not gaining HP back from no agro like they do quickly. Then they would have seen a small dwarf and hobbit team tagging this mob. It is generally happening when mobs like this are not back to full HP or are pulled way far from their spawn sites. <BR><BR>SA has always had policy never to engage till it is very clear that another guild had fully wiped and the mob has lost agro on that guild. I had always been led to believe that ED also ran under that policy. <BR><BR>I do not know if I would have lived till my members got him. But that is not the point here. The point is ?.I was in active pulling when you all did engage. You did NOT wait the next 2 mins to see if I could finish what I started or die trying.<BR><BR>That is where there is the wrong.<BR><BR>I am past the point of mad and back to the point of utter disapointment and depression that so many good and talented players can resort to this situation on a mob encounter like this, that we all know is a royal pain in the hind end and means so much to so many. <IMG SRC="/Forums/images/smiles/icon_frown.gif"></FONT><BR>
