We decided to go with our Ssra path today, and had a solid day of raiding there. Started the day off with the Creator, loot was hmm, Shield and uh some other stuff (ok, ok take me to court already, I dont have The List (tm) pulled up atm). Next we worked in the Cursed series, loot here was leather and chain BPs, as well as the Rogue Piercer. Congrats to the winners. Moving right along... The Arch Lich was next to fall. Helm, Shield, and Sword were the loots, congrats to the winners! To close out the night, we went to the Emperor's chambers.... Pretty routine fight, loot was better today, with a Robe, Shoulders, and 2hs sword. Wtg, Xarpolis, Shinhayabusa and Arkel on their new items. Yeah, yeah, here are a few pictures. <br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/koadicsrobe.jpg"><br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/shawl.jpg"><br><br>and the Sword is pictured in old news. <br><br>As a bonus, here is a picture from one of our Vex Thal raids...

We have been raiding pretty hard the last week, working through Vex Thal. We killed a few other mobs as they spawned, but most of the time we have been in Vex. <br><br>A little personal commentary before we get to the news. I really like Vex Thal's concept and design. The graphics and models are well done, except for it being too dang dark. But the mobs and the loot need a retune pretty badly. For the difficulty and length of time to get in there, we feel most of the rewards should be better. Two items per boss doesnt go very far when trying to feed 50 hungry mouths, know what I mean? >Ok, back to our regularly scheduled broadcast.<<br><br>To start off with here is a shot of our last stopping point. Yup, in the room of Aten Ha Ra herself. One bad chick! We tried her once, but was after 1 am, on a work night for most of us, so we regrouped and camped out, to try again soon. <br><br><yes Martha, the pictures are not displaying properly, will fix it shortly, come back then!><br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/atenroom1.jpg"><br><br>Before we got to this point though, we did some serious work. Killing the twin slime guards and scoring a few decent items in the process. <br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/kaasthoxxiaten.jpg"><br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/sscloak.jpg"><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/wandwater.jpg"><br><br>and from his brother:<br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/piety.jpg"><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/disguise.jpg"><br><br>A bit earlier we had killed several Diabos, another Kaas, and the kid sister, Va Xi Aten Ha Ra. She is quite a pain to be sure. That about sums up our Vex Thal progress for the moment. (I have a lot more picts of loot and rooms, will post them when I get around to it. sorry!)<br><br>In some older news, we downed the Cursed twice (only one set of loot due to Ssra crashing about 10 seconds after he died the first time, and time warping us back to 20 minutes prior. Talk about bad luck.), Aow, and Emperor the other day in a very nice Trifecta. Loot was especially poor on the Aow and Emperor, with 2 bows and a Mask from Aow, and 2 pally/Sk shields and the 2hs from the Emperor. Does any guild out there not have enough Pally/Sk gear to last through the next expansion??? <br><br>-Naz</font></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table><br><br>

I can say that I absolutely enjoyed my break, and think most of the crew did too. Whew, I need to move to the beach, anyone got a place in Hawaii for me?? <br><br>Alright already, hold your horses! We did a few mobs today, to get back in the saddle again. Started in our home away from home, Ssra. The Blood and Emperor were up and waiting, so we headed on in. Both fights were pretty standard, the Blood dropped Earing and Bracer, congrats to Clenzz and Vindica for their lewts. <br><br>The Emperor was next, and was a great effort and solid fight. Loot was Sword, Moccasins, and Shield. Congrats to Iustus, Koveres, and Janez on their items. <br><br>Time to head to the basement, and see if we can get the Cursed spawn working right. Some other people had bugged it somehow, so..... we had a suprise. We kill the mobs to spawn it, and we have TWO snakes sitting there, the Runed and Glyphed... due to the despawn timer, we fooled around with splitting, and said "forget it, bring them both!" so, we fought them both at the same time. Lots of flopping around this fight. We were able to win, and move on to the next pair. The Banished and the Exiled. We took these guys on at the same time also for kicks, and once again won, got a screenshot or two for you here. <br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/vyz.jpg"><br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/vyzh.jpg"><br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/duo.jpg"><br><br>Yes, yes the suspense is building, I know... Did we get TWO Cursed??? <br><br><br>Sadly, we only had one. Damnit! As usual a bugged spawn doesnt help the players ( oh well. We did take the Cursed down, and were rewarded with Rogue Dagger, Cleric Cloak, and a nifty range item. Congrats to Radric, Akuni, and Tisa on their new toys. <br><br>Some people keep sending eyes down to our fight to see what we doing. To save them the trouble, I will post a picture of the now famous Ogre Wall Manuver. You simply cannot kill the Cursed without this tactic. <br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/wall.jpg"><br><br>:)<br><br>Moving right along now, we hit up a couple bosses in Vex Thal. We took out Kaas first, loot was a cloak and mantle, congrats go to Willis (Jr) and Fyrestrike (he still plays??) I hope these get upgraded.... and to finish the night we took on Diabo Xi Xin. Loots were cloak and shield, /yawn, not sure who got these, am too tired! <br><br>(all the loots mentioned here are in old updates, so check around for the stats)<br><br>-Naz</font></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table><br><br>

We started in Ssra with some respawns there, taking out the Arch Lich first in a fun fight. I always enjoy tanking this guy, picture Yelinak on steroids, if you will. Loot was Helm, Pally Sword (big suprise, eh?), and Earing. Screen shots of that loot is in our archives, if you wanna check them out. Congrats to winners!<br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/al1.jpg"><br><br>Next we moved to the High Priest. Once again, business as usual, and a nice job all around. Loot was belt, sword(does anyone else think there are too many weapons in the game? Give us some useful stuff for other slots already.), and halo. Once again, these items with stats are pictured elsewhere in old news.<br><br>Time to roll out to the Emperor now. For a change we didnt have to farm quest part, so we actually got to the Emperor room quite fast. Yay! Pretty much a flawless fight, two deaths I think (yup, yours truly was one. I blame the clerics with the last name Latehealer!)You asked for it, you got it, here are some screen shots of of the loots. <br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/torque.jpg"><br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/sword.jpg"><br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/moc.jpg"><br><br>WTG Ghark, Willis, and Drahreg on loots!

Vila, our resident tank bard decided she was ready to take on the Emperor himself. Vila is pretty buffed up with 1550 ac and nearly 6200 hps. Not bad for a bard! My best screenshot showing the results of the Emperor vs Vila didnt come out, but I was able to get a quote from the Emp.... <br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/ssra.jpg"><br><br>stay out of our warrior chat, bard!! got it?!<br><br><br>*shameless advertisement follows<br><br>(If you are looking to join a raid guild, we are always looking for a few good men (yeah, yeah, and women too I guess...)check our info section for details and classes.

We have been quietly working behind the scenes in this place, and had time to down another boss tonight. Diabo Xi Xin Thall fell to our forces. I wont spoil the details of the mob, but he has a nice aoe to contend with, as well as massive hps. Loot was mediocre robe, and an orb that is, hmm, interesting is the word I will use. <br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/robeshadows.jpg"><br><br><p align=center> <IMG SRC="News/orb.jpg"><br><br>Congrats Vila and Lelaa on some new gear.<br><br>Thats about it for the serious stuff.
