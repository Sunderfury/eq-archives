As guildleader of ED for over 5 years, I have seen many people come and go, but the desire to play this game to it’s fullest never left. I salute Heltwyk and Yakita, the other two Guildleaders ED had, each and every member of ED who made this guild the best there was on Tarew Marr since real raids began. I will leave you guys with this one final note and some of my memories. I apologize in advance if I leave any friends names out, it wasn’t intended. <br><br>Way back when, just after the Plane of Fear opened, and it wasn’t level restricted, a group of us got together and decided we would make guild, we were currently in another guild, Mithril Legion, but not satisfied. Heltwyk, Zuez, Safron, Frikk, Frakk, Zezal and the old Troll, Nazlug, got together to make something happen. (There were a few others and unfortunately I cant recall them. Old age and all.) From those early days of racing guilds to Vox and Nagafen, to the calls of “First in Force” which I still believe cut down on the drama with other guilds, to the opening of a Plane of Fear with no level restrictions. We did it all. Anyone still have a lvl 5 alt logged there I wonder? Then came Plane of Hate and the oh so wonderful pathing there. Mobs would come from all over the zone with funky agro. The calls of “camp a cleric, now!” would be made frequently. Guilds even worked together on this. There is nothing like a naked Fear or Hate break, from back in the day. <br><br>Next came Kunark, and still ED was at the top. Some contenders for the Crown of TM had arisen, they gave a good fight, but in the end it was still ED #1. Keys to Sebilis, camping Disco 1. Getting the elite robe from back there. Anyone remember sitting in the small Reet Froglok room  of deeper Sebilis, while the monks worked magic and cleared Trak’s Lair? I think I spent 2 full days down there, and never even saw the big beast himself. Wipes to the Protector, monks dragging bodies all the way back to the drop down room, Necros like Dieux, Trojena, Rinlar, and Zrazzt running back to summon 50 people. Oh the glory days! Finally that beast fell, and the wonderful Complete Heal cleric BP was found. Damn, talk about needing a nerf! <br><br>Along came Velious, and something new, factions. Giants, dwarves, and dragons, oh my! Many people call this the best expansion ever, but who knows. The races with Black Company and others to Klandicar, the numerous wipes we all had in the Western Wastes. Finally cracking ToV, and learning the meaning of “long raids”. This brought about the practice of camping at the “safe spot” overnight, and picking the raid up the next day. Those were indeed the days. When the big wyrm at the end finally fell, after a 30 minute fight, it felt great! Next came Sleepers Tomb, which after months of keying we cracked and eventually cleared. This lead to one of the biggest Drama Fest’s in Server History when we killed all 4 Warders and released the Sleeper. Contrary to what any of the goomba’s out there say, we had planned all along to release the Sleeper the day before the next expansion, and that is exactly what we did.  With Velious conquered, that led us to the next expansion.<br><br>Hello, Luclin! This brought about the Bazaar, Ssra Temple, the mod rod nerf, and long hours of keying for the incomplete Vex Thal. I actually liked this expansion a great deal. We first entered through the basement I think from the Deep. There we ran into those Star Gate looking level teleporters. Fighting the various boss snakes like the High Priest required a totally new strategy, and brought about off tanking and add control. A good effort by the designers indeed.  I still recall zoning up to the Emperor Ssra’s chamber, and seeing the Blood and the other snakes all in a circle, and the Emperor himself standing like a statue, this was very cool indeed. When he was finally tuned properly, ED was the first guild on any server to take him down, and it was a great night for the gamers of this guild. We moved on to Vex Thal next, and oh boy, what a mess. This was a very hard zone to start with, and was tedious to the extreme, as you had to dungeon crawl with a large raid force from one point to another. The invulnerable Warders were bugged, and often our progress was stopped by them. Eventually it too was conquered, and the zone was later revamped and made much better. In the end, this is one of my favorite zones, and I have great memories with the Guild from there. <br><br>A new age of Everquest began with the Planes of Power. Level 65 was the new cap, and AA points were a common term now. This brought keying to the next level, with something called Flagging. The designers had layed out a nice progression for the guilds to follow, but unfortunately back flagging became a major hassle for all guilds, and actually resulted in unparalleled cooperation between the guilds on TM. Pretty much everyone would back flag anyone else’s members. Thank you to the guild leaders for that. The real race was to become elementally flagged. After crawling through various zones like Disease, Decay, and uh what was Saryn’s place called? Looked like a “B” horror movie set, but was cool none the less. Eventually we got to Fire, and quickly conquered Fire, Water, and Air, while we all waited for Earth to be fixed, since Plane of Time was not ready for play yet. This brought about the timed encounter in Plane of Water. Very different, and also a pain, but a new challenge. We also got  the convenience of Graveyards. When Earth was finally ready, and beaten, the Plane of Time opened up. This was a great zone, and was somewhat like ToV part 2. It had many boss mobs, and was a raid zone. It also had the fun of breaking the raid into mini raids, each to handle encounters, and all dependant on each other. I really liked this aspect, it made everyone in the guild better players, and it was much harder to rest on the shoulders of a few key players. We quickly beat this and advanced deep into the zone, and learned that equipment and AA pts. really, really mattered. This also brought on the absurd dependence on clerics. Still a fault in this game today, sadly. Eventually the four headed Dragon fell as well. It was farm time yet again. <br><br>Next came GoD, and my last expansion as Guildleader. This expansion brought back many of the elements of earlier expansions, such as travel time, and danger while you did it. It made people actually pay attention when they played, so of course the “casual gamer” hated it and said it was only for the ubers.  It too had much promise, but was so poorly tuned out of the box that many players just skipped it all together. A sad expansion for me to retire on, but in the end, I said something to the guild hundreds of times over the years. No you lamers, it wasn’t “Focus!!” it was “real life first, always” and that’s the way it has to be. <br><br>-Nazlug<br>-Enlightened Dark<br><br>P.S.<br><br>I would love to give a shout out to all my friends over the years, many who I met in places like Minneapolis, Boston, Orlando, and Las Vegas (x2). If I do that, I will surely leave someone out. So instead, I ask all you ED’ers and anyone else who bothered to read all this, to check the roster of the guild one last time. Think about the fun you had with the people there you played with. There are hundreds of names, but I know I can remember something about each and every member who played with me, until my retirement. <br><br>Think about the small groups that we spent hours and hours with. I look back at my friend Bregott and I sitting at the zone of Lower Guk, when there were about 12 people on the server who knew where it was, and were of the level to fight there. To meeting Zuez and Heltwyk, and going for his first Ghoulsbane. To camping Rubicite in Cazic, to Mithril in Sol B. Remember the fun, and the small groups. To each and everyone of you, I /salute you and would game with you again.<br><br>P.S.S<br><br>Check back on this webpage in the VERY near future… There is indeed something going on. Someone said something about an old troll “getting the band back together” for Act II.
