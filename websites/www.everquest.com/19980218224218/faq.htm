<p><a name="1.0 General questions."><font size="4" face="Georgia"><strong>1.0
General questions.</strong><em><strong> </strong></em></font></a></p>

<p><b>1.1 What is a FAQ? </b></p>

<p>FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions. FAQs are designed
to cover the most common questions and answers regarding a
product.</p>

<p><b>1.2 What is EverQuest?</b></p>

<p>EverQuest is a real 3D massively multiplayer online RPG.
Another equally accurate way of describing EverQuest is to call
it a graphical MUD. </p>

<p><b>1.3 What is an RPG?</b></p>

<p>RPG stands for Role-Playing Game. People often debate what
this really means, so we'll attempt to clarify what we mean. When
you play EverQuest you'll first create a character. This creation
of yours can be any one of 12 races and 14 classes, male or
female, and you even have the opportunity to adjust your
attributes (for instance, how strong you are, or how intelligent
you aren't). You'll then immerse this character of yours into our
virtual world and make of him or her whatever you wish. You
define your role in the lands of EverQuest and how well you play
that role it is up to you. People also often assume that RPG
means an certain theme or setting. While we don't necessarily
agree that this is always true, EverQuest is a traditional RPG.
Our world is one of high fantasy, of sorcery and dragons, of
great wizards and marauding hoards of orcs. There are quests and
puzzles to solve aplenty, but it's up to you decide which ones,
if any, to pursue. You might choose to become a warrior bent on
wanton destruction, or perhaps a merchant making his profit
selling goods from one land to another. Essentially, while we've
defined the setting, you create the world. </p>

<p><b>1.4 What do you mean by 3D?</b></p>

<p>We realize that the term 3D is loosely used almost everywhere
today. In reference to EverQuest, however, we mean it quite
literally. Our engine is truly 3D -- it is not a raycaster, nor
does it use a pseudo-3D isometric view. You can walk completely
around a house or any structure and then enter it, all the while
adjusting the camera view between first person and any number of
top-down or 3rd person viewpoints. </p>

<p><b>1.5 What's a &quot;massively multiplayer online game&quot;?</b></p>

<p>While many modern computer games support multiplayer gaming,
few are designed to support well over 1,000 simultaneous players.
With EverQuest, you don't start the server program on a local
network and invite a few of your friends over to play. Instead,
you run the EverQuest client program and use the Internet to
connect to our World Server. This server will run 24 hours a day,
7 days a week, creating a truly persistent environment. Call or
email your friends and tell them in what city or dungeon to meet
you, or better yet log on and encounter hundreds of other people
from all over the world and make a slew of new acquaintances. </p>

<p>That's EverQuest, and this is what massively multiplayer
really means. </p>

<p><b>1.6 What's a MUD?</b></p>

<p>MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons/Dimensions) are online text-based
RPGs that have been around for several years. EverQuest is
similar to these MUDs, except it was designed from the ground up
to depict our world using real-time 16bit color fully texture
mapped graphics, as opposed to merely a well written paragraph.</p>

<p>Also, while most of these MUDs are run by a couple of people
as a hobby in their spare time, EverQuest is a professional and
commercial product -- our staff will be on hand 24 hours a day to
meet your needs both as a player and as a customer. </p>

<p><b>1.7 Who are you guys? Where did EverQuest come from?</b></p>

<p>The EverQuest team is part of SISA (Sony Interactive Studios
America), the same studio that's brought you PSX hits like Rally
Cross and NFL Gameday '97.</p>

<p>We've taken the console world by storm, and now we're setting
our sights on online gaming. EverQuest will be the second online
title to be released by SISA, with many more to follow. Our first
online game, Tanarus, has been released and is in stores now..
It's a multiplayer futuristic tactical tank combat game, and it's
hot! Check out the web site, <a href="http://www.tanarus.com/">http://www.tanarus.com</a>
and download the latest version of the client software now. </p>

<p><b>1.8 What kind of hardware and software will be required to
play EverQuest?</b></p>

<p>The EverQuest client program requires a fast Pentium, with a
Direct 3D compliant 3D card and 32 megabytes of RAM. The program
runs under Windows 95 or Windows NT. We recommend a 3D card at
least as fast as the Voodoo 3DFX. Note that this is estimate, and
is subject to change as game development progresses.</p>

<p><b>1.9 Which 3D cards will you support?</b></p>

<p>EverQuest will use Direct 3D, which will allow us to support
most 3D cards currently on the market and those coming out. </p>

<p><b>1.10 Will the game be downloadable or will it be on CD?</b></p>

<p>CD-ROM.</p>

<p><b>1.11 What kind of music will there be in EverQuest? Midi
files, or directly off the CD? </b></p>

<p>We aren&#146;t releasing that info at this time.</p>

<p><b>1.12 Will game info be saved on servers or on our Hard
drive? </b></p>

<p>Servers. We are very sensitive to the fact that hackers exist,
and are implementing several plans to guard against them.</p>

<p><b>1.13 Will there be hot keys or programmable macros in the
game? </b></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><b>1.14 Do you plan to continuously update the game after its
initial release? </b></p>

<p>Absolutely. The world of EverQuest will be a constantly
evolving and expanding universe.</p>

<p><b>1.15 How much will EverQuest cost me?</b></p>

<p>This is another good question, but one that is also a bit too
early to elaborate on. Suffice it to say that EverQuest will be
very competitive with other games of the same genre.</p>

<p><a name="2.0 About the beta test."><font size="4"><strong>2.0
About the beta test.</strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><b>2.1 When is the closed test and the open beta test
scheduled to start?</b></p>

<p>When we feel ready -- we don't want to rush things. Open Beta
will occur after we finish the closed test.</p>

<p><b>2.2 Will you have regular people like me in the closed
test?</b></p>

<p>The exact criteria a qualified person involved in the closed
test hasn't been finalized, but I can say what will be most
important to us, and that is experience with online RPGs and
MUDs. </p>

<p><b>2.3 Do you know how many people you will accept into the
closed test?</b></p>

<p>Not yet. </p>

<p><b>2.4 How long will the closed test and open beta last?</b></p>

<p>There's no way to predict that at this point in development.</p>

<p><b>2.5 How will the selection be made for the closed test?
First come, first selected, or will you take into account RPG
experience, online gaming experience or beta test experience?</b></p>

<p>See 2.2, and yes, previous experience as a beta tester would
help too, but the primary qualification is experience with online
RPGs and MUDs. </p>

<p><b>2.6 Do I get to my beta character with all stats and items
intact when the commercial version ships?</b></p>

<p>This really hasn't been determined yet -- probably not,
however we are planning on rewarding beta testers in the game
after the commercial version ships. Keep in mind, though, that we
also need to make sure that all things are fair for those who did
not participate in the beta. </p>

<p><b>2.7 How much will the beta CD cost? </b></p>

<p>The entire issue of how much anything related to EverQuest
will cost is something it's way too early to get into.</p>

<p><a name="3.0 Features."><font size="4" face="Georgia"><strong>3.0
Features.</strong></font></a><font size="3" face="Georgia"> </font></p>

<p><b>3.1 What's the screen resolution for the game and number of
colors?</b></p>

<p>640x480 16bit color (that's 64,000 colors). </p>

<p><b>3.2 Can we run the game at higher resolution if we have the
horsepower for it?</b></p>

<p>Not sure about this yet. </p>

<p><b>3.3 How big is the game world?</b></p>

<p>Huge. It should take a very long time to walk from one end to
the other. </p>

<p><b>3.4 What kind of communication will there be in the game?
Will we be able to send messages privately or to broadcast to the
entire server? </b></p>

<p>You'll be able to do the following:</p>

<p>1. Say things to people in your general area</p>

<p>2. Shout things across the zone you are in</p>

<p>3. Tell someone a message privately</p>

<p>4. Say things such that only people grouped with you can hear.
</p>

<p><b>3.5 The game will be server based -- can I switch servers
to go meet friends on another server?</b></p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p><b>3.6 If I switch servers, will my character keep his levels
and equipment or will I start new? And can I switch back and
forth between servers?</b></p>

<p>We're still working this out -- off the top of my head, I'd
say that level and items should transfer over, but certain unique
artifacts may not. Also, we probably won't be able to allow
constant switching between servers.</p>

<p><b>3.7 Will there be some other ways to travel than walking?
Horses, boats or teleport spell?</b></p>

<p>Ships and teleport spells, yes. Horses we hope, if we have the
room and can keep the poly count down. There will also be a few
other more exotic ways to traverse the lands of Norrath.</p>

<p><b>3.7.1 When traveling in the wilderness between towns, is
the player's view going to be first person the entire duration of
travel, or will there be an overhead view of the map of the
region?</b></p>

<p>Travelling long distances is exactly the same as walking
around a city or dungeon. The views themselves are the same
throughout the game -- you can choose from first person or from
several third person viewpoints. As for the time it takes to walk
from one zone to another, depending on the distance, it could
take a while. Now that doesn't mean there won't be high level
spells and perhaps some other ways to 'shorten' those distances. </p>

<p><b>3.8 How will fighting work? Real time or turned based?</b></p>

<p>Real time, but I must stress that this is not a 'twitch' game.
It won't matter how quick you can click that mouse button.
Weapons have speeds, and they will 'go off' (i.e. swing, fire,
etc.) at that speed. It's like playing the piano to a metronome
-- it's real time, but you can't exceed a set pace. </p>

<p><b>3.9 Will someone with a better connection have an advantage
over someone with a poor connection?</b></p>

<p>Not during combat or other critical times. Certainly having a
better connection will reduce lag and some warping, but it won't
put you at a disadvantage necessarily in terms of game play. </p>

<p><b>3.10 Will there be night and day and how long does an
EverQuest day last in real time?</b></p>

<p>Yes, there is a night and day. We are still tweaking how long
each period will last -- I imagine this will be determined in the
betas. </p>

<p><b>3.11 How dark is night? Do I need a spell or torch to see
at night?</b></p>

<p>Well, many areas are lighted... but if you're talking about
whether you can see with no torch or spells in the bottom of a
cave, I'd say no. Unless you have infravision...</p>

<p><b>3.12 Will there be an active economy in the game?</b></p>

<p>Yes, there is an economy in EverQuest. Price will change
according to supply and demand. If an item is offered more often
then bought the price will go down.</p>

<p><b>3.13 Will there be weather in the game?</b></p>

<p>Yes, you will see rain, fog, wind, and this will affect
gameplay (i.e. visibility, slippery surfaces, etc.).</p>

<p><b>3.14 How many cities and other zones will there be in the
game? </b></p>

<p>There should be between 6 and 12 cities, and well over 20
adventure zones. And remember, the world will continue to expand
after the initial release.</p>

<p><b>3.15 EverQuest is supposedly playable from different
viewpoints. Has any thought been put into ensuring that no one
viewpoint has an undue advantage over another?</b></p>

<p>It's pretty hard to look down a hall or a tunnel or a street
in the top down view. Also, there's a lot of information and
detail in the background textures that you might miss if you're
not in 1st person mode. By their natures, different views have
different advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p><b>3.15.1 Is the EverQuest development team doing what they
can to ensure a player won't be &quot;unduly&quot; hampered (or
favored) by his or her choice of view?</b></p>

<p>If a person were to stick to any one view they would be at a
disadvantage. The plan is to have several different user
definable camera views that are toggled between depending on the
situation. &quot;Hmm, I can't tell whether or not I can jump
across this ravine... (toggle to top down view) Oh man! That is
farther than it looked in first person view.. I better find
another way.&quot; Or (in first person view) &quot;Get ready!
There are a band of Orcs coming out of the forest!&quot; (I would
not have seen them if I were in top down view until they we
almost upon my party and me.) So yes, if you stick to one view
and only one view more than likely you will not live as long as
someone who takes advantage of all the possible views.</p>

<p><b>3.16 As I recall, no existent screenshot of the adventure
window shows a character from a first-person-perspective
viewpoint equipped with either weapon or shield, a la Daggerfall,
Meridian, and countless Doom clones. Why?</b></p>

<p>The latest screen shots (August) show swords in just about all
the character's hands. Different weapons and shields will indeed
appear wielded or worn by the character. Also, all the screen
shots from August were taken from first person perspective mode.
But in any case, the weapons and shields and such will show
regardless of where the camera is.</p>

<p><b>3.16.1 The August screenshots (or most of them) show
characters being looked at with swords in hand. However, the
character that is doing the looking doesn't appear to be holding
anything. Why?</b></p>

<p>The sword just isn't visible from the first person view
because of where it is (kind of to your side). Were you to swing
it or do one of many other animations, you would see it as well
as your hand, arm, etc.</p>

<p><b>3.17 How will we control our characters? Keyboard, mouse,
joystick, or combination?</b></p>

<p>Keyboard or mouse &#150; we will support mouselook.</p>

<p><b>3.18 Will there be a screen capture utility in EverQuest?</b></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><b>3.19 On the creatures page there are deities...will there
be some kind of religion in EQ?</b></p>

<p>There are many different religions.</p>

<p><b>3.19.1 Will religions affect how I should role-play my
character in some ways?</b></p>

<p>We can't get into that yet.</p>

<p><b>3.20 Can you give us hints as to the storyline? What will
be one's purpose in the game?</b></p>

<p>There's no set storyline... just a vast history. The players
will make the stories by interacting with the world.</p>

<p><b>3.21 Will +mlook be supported in 1st person view?</b></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><b>3.22 Will towns be closed after dark, ala Daggerfall?</b></p>

<p>They might lock the main gates... but since when did gates
keep out a good rogue...</p>

<p><b>3.23 When adventuring can we form parties?</b></p>

<p>In fact, you are encouraged to form parties.</p>

<p><b>3.23.1 Will experience be shared amongst party members? And
how?</b></p>

<p>It is, but we're not going into details on that yet.</p>

<p><b>3.23.2 If I'm in a party and we kill a monster, is the
experience shared the same way as if two people not in a party
kill a monster together?</b></p>

<p>No, it's different. You will want to group up when fighting
monsters. Think about it: a warrior makes the kill, but a cleric
has been healing him -- the cleric should get some experience
too.</p>

<p><b>3.24 Will there be huge underwater areas, sort of like an
underwater continent?</b></p>

<p>Not an entire continent, but entire zones, yes.</p>

<p><a name="4.0 Characters."><font size="4" face="Georgia"><strong>4.0
Characters.</strong></font></a><font size="4" face="Georgia"><strong>
</strong></font></p>

<p><b>4.1 How many characters can one person have on one account?</b></p>

<p>Eight at this time. </p>

<p><b>4.2 If I have more than one character, can I have both
online at the same time and trade between them?</b></p>

<p>I can't answer that yet. </p>

<p><b>4.3 Will character improvement be skilled based or level
based?</b></p>

<p>Both, and more.</p>

<p><b>4.4 How many classes and races are there? And what are
they?</b></p>

<p>There are 12 races: Barbarian, Dark Elf, Dwarf, Erudite,
Gnome, Half-Elf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Ogre, Troll, Wood
Elf. There are 14 classes: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter,
Magician, Monk, Necromancer, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadow
Knight, Shaman, Warrior, Wizard.</p>

<p><b>4.4.1 Will there be the possibility of adding new
races/classes as the game expands?</b></p>

<p>Absolutely. We look forward to adding quite a bit to the game.</p>

<p><b>4.5 Can a character be multi-class like a warrior-mage?</b></p>

<p>There are some hybrid classes, like Paladins
(warrior-clerics), and Shadow Knights (warrior-necromancers)</p>

<p><b>4.6 Are certain classes reserved for certain races or can
all races be of any class?</b></p>

<p>Yes, certain classes are reserved for certain races. </p>

<p><b>4.7 Will there be alignment in the game? And how much of an
impact will it have on gameplay?</b></p>

<p>Yes, and a lot. </p>

<p><b>4.8 Can we play male or female characters?</b></p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p><b>4.9 Will we be able to select how our character looks? I
mean eyes, hair and such?</b></p>

<p>Depends on race -- some races are more customizable than
others. </p>

<p><b>4.10 Will clothes, armor and weapon be visible to other
players?</b></p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p><b>4.11 Can I have a shop or be a blacksmith like in Ultima
Online?</b></p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p><b>4.12 Will there be a set of attributes we select at the
creation process that will remain the same through the game like
Intellect, strength and so on?</b></p>

<p>Not exactly, there will be attributes like strength, charisma,
stamina, wisdom, intelligence, dexterity, and agility -- these
can increase or decrease with special items and spells.</p>

<p><b>4.13 Will I be able to put a biography on my character for
when people look at me?</b></p>

<p>I can't go into this right now. </p>

<p><b>4.14 Will my character age? And if he does can he die of
old age?</b></p>

<p>We can't go into this yet.</p>

<p><b>4.15 Can my character eat and is it actually required to
survive?</b></p>

<p>We can't go into this yet.</p>

<p><b>4.16 Can my character sleep?</b></p>

<p>We can't go into this yet.</p>

<p><b>4.17 Will I be able to wear disguises?</b></p>

<p>You can alter what you wear, which will change your
appearance.</p>

<p><b>4.18 Is there a maximum level my character can attain?</b></p>

<p>We haven&#146;t made a decision regarding that yet.</p>

<p><b>4.19 How many items can I wear or have equipped?</b></p>

<p>There are 21 body locations to wear items, as well as general
inventory in which you can hold containers that allow you to
carry even more.</p>

<p><b>4.20 When our characters gain experience will they change
forms or change into a higher form in the class, e.g.
wizard-sorcerer, knight-paladin?</b></p>

<p>There will be titles based on level and accomplishments.</p>

<p><b>4.21 Will resting replenish hitpoints?</b></p>

<p>Yes, but having a cleric as a friend is more efficient.</p>

<p><a name="5.0 Skills."><font size="4" face="Georgia"><strong>5.0
Skills.</strong></font></a><font size="4" face="Georgia"><strong>
</strong></font></p>

<p><b>5.1 Are all skills available to all classes or races or are
some race or class specific?</b></p>

<p>Some are available to all, some are class specific, and some
are race specific. </p>

<p><b>5.2 Can you tell us some of the skills that will be in the
game?</b></p>

<p>I can name a few: swimming, backstabbing, stealing, and a lot
more.</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>You start with some, you earn others as your character

<p>No, PK area affect spells will only affect other PKers and
NPC's. </p>

NPCs and creatures.</strong></font></a><font size="3"
face="Georgia"> </font></p>

<p><b>7.1 How much interaction will there be with the NPCs? Will
they just sell and buy stuff?</b></p>

<p>They'll do a lot more than that, however I cannot go into
details right now. </p>

<p><b>7.2 Can you kill NPCs?</b></p>

<p>Yes, and that's fairly integral to the game. </p>

<p><b>7.3 Will monsters all be the same? Or will some retreat
when hurt, or follow you until either they are dead or you are?</b></p>

<p>The latter, but I can't go into details. </p>

<p><b>7.4 Will NPCs use magic?</b></p>

<p>Some, yes. </p>

<p><b>7.5 Are some of the creatures going to use spells during
fights?</b></p>

<p>Some, yes. </p>

<p><b>7.6 Will some of the creatures/monsters be the same races
and classes as our characters? I mean can I fight a human mage
NPC?</b></p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p><b>7.7 How many types of monsters will there be in the game?</b></p>

<p>There should be well over 40 types of monsters, ranging from
dragons to giant bats.</p>

<p><b>7.7.1 You've said there would be over 40 monsters. Is that
40 monster types or 10 types with palette swaps?</b></p>

<p>We'll try to get as many in there as we can. Look at it this
way: there will be far more than 40 monsters, but how different
they will look from one another is a different story. For
instance, will an Orc slave look different from an Orc
commoner... probably not, but we shall see.</p>

<p><b>7.8 Can I hire an NPC to protect my belongings or me? </b></p>

<p>We can't go into that yet.</p>

size="4" face="Georgia"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><b>8.1 Will there be some magic items in the game?</b></p>

<p>Not some, a lot! </p>

<p><b>8.2 Are some items going to be unique, where there is only
one in the game?</b></p>

<p>Yes, we call them artifacts. They will be awarded to
characters who do remarkable things. </p>

<p><b>8.3 Are there going to be some weapons or armor that are
the best in the game? Will everyone be wearing the same armor or
use the same weapon because it's the best there is? Or will armor
and weapons have advantages and disadvantages?</b></p>

<p>'Best' will be very subjective and relative to what the player
wants for his character. It will also be situational. If one item
gives you fire protection, it may be essential in the volcano
level, but useless in the underwater zone. </p>

<p><b>8.4 Are all items useable by all races and classes?</b></p>

<p>Some are, some aren't. Weapons can be set to be usable by only
particular races and classes. </p>

<p><b>8.5 Will weapons, armor and other items wear out with use?
If so will we have a blacksmith skill to repair them, or a spell,
or will some NPCs be able to do it?</b></p>

<p>We&#146;re haven&#146;t decided that yet.</p>

<p><b>8.6 Can we set up a &quot;safe&quot; house or rent a
&quot;safe&quot; room? Or maybe safety deposit boxes in banks in
major cities? Just a place to store items and treasures? Note:
this implies that you go adventuring in order to afford rent.</b></p>

<p>A house will be as &quot;safe&quot; as you make it. </p>

<p><b>8.7 Will a long sword, broad sword, and short sword all
look the same or will they each have their own look?</b></p>

<p>We'll fit as many different images as we can in, for each type
of item. </p>

<p><a name="9.0 Quests."><font size="4"><strong>9.0 Quests. </strong></font></a></p>

<p><b>9.1 What kind of quests can we expect in EverQuest? Simple
quests, like go fetch something for an NPC, or more complex
quests that will require either teamwork or finding clues as to
how to accomplish the quests?</b></p>

<p>Both. </p>

<p><b>9.2 Are the quests generated automatically or will there be
some kind of gamemaster introducing major quests once in a while?</b></p>

<p>Both. </p>

<p><b>9.3 How will the quests be reset? I mean can I do the same
quest over and over?</b></p>

<p>I can't go into this right now. </p>

<p><a name="10.0 Guilds."><font size="4" face="Georgia"><strong>10.0
Guilds.</strong></font></a><font size="3" face="Georgia"> </font></p>

<p><b>10.1 Will there be guilds in the game? Game operated guilds
like a thieves guild or just player run guilds?</b></p>

<p>Both. </p>

<p><b>10.2 Will there be special guilds functions? Like ranks or
the ability to buy a guildhall?</b></p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p><b>10.3 Can guilds have special clothes or uniforms, or a logo
on their shield?</b></p>

<p>Not sure yet. </p>

<p><b>10.4 If my guild becomes very big and active, will there be
special quests for it? </b></p>

<p>Yes, sometimes we will introduce quests for very active
guilds.</p>

<p><a name="11.0 Pkilling and death."><font size="4"
face="Georgia"><strong>11.0 Pkilling and death.</strong></font></a><font
size="4" face="Georgia"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><b>11.1 Will Pkilling be allowed in the game?</b></p>

<p>Yes and no. See #11.2. </p>

<p><b>11.2 I heard about a pk switch? How will this work? Is it
something you select at the beginning when creating your
character or is it something one can toggle on and off at will?</b></p>

<p>You select it when you create your character. If you choose to
abstain from PK, only NPCs can kill you. Certain actions can
switch you from non-PK to PK, and it may be possible to switch
back, although if we do allow this, it will be a long and hard
series of tasks one must complete before switching back to
non-PK. </p>

<p><b>11.3 If I have my pk switch set to no-pkill, can I heal a
friend while he fights another player?</b></p>

<p>Yes, but that will most likely result in you switching to PK. </p>

<p><b>11.3.1 If I have my pk switch set to no-pkill, can I heal a
friend while he fights a monster without turning PK?</b></p>

<p>I believe a non-PK cleric will become PK anytime they heal a
PK. (They knew the job was dangerous when they took it). </p>

<p><b>11.4 Can I steal stuff, or pickpocket with the switch set
to no-pkill? That would make it impossible for people to get back
at me. </b></p>

<p>You may not steal from another player if you are non-PK. You
can, however, steal from NPCs. If you are PK, you may steal from
both PK players and NPCs. </p>

<p><b>11.4.1 If I have my switch set to no-pkill and go
adventuring with my friend who has his switch on and another
player kills him, can I take his stuff before the PKer steals it?</b></p>

<p>A non-PKer will not be able to loot a PK corpse. </p>

<p><b>11.5 Are there negative consequences to Pkilling? Like
getting arrested in cities, not being able to shop, or stuff like
that?</b></p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p><b>11.6 Will some areas be safe-zones or can you be killed
anywhere even in shops?</b></p>

<p>No safe-zones, but there will be consequences if you do it in
civilized areas. </p>

<p><b>11.7 Will there be guards in the cities?</b></p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p><b>11.8 Can I log off from a fight to survive?</b></p>

<p>If you log off, your character will still be in the game for a
few minutes. He will defend himself, but I'd say it's certainly
not without significant risk. </p>

<p><b>11.9 If I lose connection during a fight, will my character
defend himself or will he remain there doing nothing?</b></p>

<p>Yes, see #11.8. </p>

<p><b>11.10 In Tanarus, if you hit the ALT-Q, you actually send a
signal to the server indicating you want to willingly leave the
game. But if you lose your connection (local brownout, blackout,
rodent chews through power cord, etc.) this signal is not sent.
In this situation, couldn't you simply be listed as &quot;XXXXX
has been disconnected&quot; without any penalty and without your
character remaining in the game for a few minutes?</b></p>

<p>We would have to handle both cases in the same manner to avoid
abuse by the less than honorable who would intentionally drop
signal (ctrl-alt-del, reset, etc.) to avoid defeat. </p>

<p><b>11.11 Will there be any environments where a Non-PKer can
challenge another player? Perhaps in a non-lethal way?</b></p>

<p>Yes, there will be Arenas and other locations where Non-Pkill
characters can fight one another -- the fight is not to the
death, but rather to unconsciousness, and the victor will be
unable to loot the loser's corpse.</p>

<p><b>11.12 How will you deal with death? Is it permanent or do
you just lose some stats, skills and stuff?</b></p>

<p>It is not permanent, however there are serious penalties. You
will want to seriously avoid death, but if you do screw up, it
doesn't mean that your character you've worked hard on for six
months is gone. </p>

<p><b>11.13 Is there a limit to the number of times you can die?</b></p>

<p>No official limit, but given the penalties, you won't want to
do it often. </p>

<p><b>11.14 When monsters die, will they remain as sprites or
fade away slowly like in Quake?</b></p>

<p>Corpses deteriorate over time.</p>
