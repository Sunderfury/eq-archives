        size="4">Goblins are nasty scavengers. Everything they
        own or work with they either discovered or stole from
        somebody. Because of their lack of ingenuity, goblins are
        either found raiding towns, or in their lairs, which are
        typically primitive villages or damp natural caves. A
        solitary goblin is rarely a threat to even the most
        novice warrior, but their nature is to form clans and
        strike in groups. Wise adventurers, wary of that fact,
        avoid goblin settlements unless their numbers are also
        great.</font></p>

        swamps of Norrath for they are the domain of the
        Frogloks. Decades of slavery and persecution have
        hardened these once timid amphibious creatures into
        fierce guerrilla warriors. Many Troll war parties have
        fallen to swift and vicious Froglok ambushes. However, if
        treated with respect and well being, the Frogloks can be
        the greatest ally an adventurer can have while traveling
        the dangerous swamplands of Norrath.</font></p>

        then animated by powerful magic, the gargoyle is a
        fearsome foe indeed. Often mistaken for statues until
        it's too late, gargoyles will strike suddenly. Their skin
        being virtually impenetrable, combined with their ability
        to fly, makes them almost impossible to damage much less
        hit at all.</font></p>

        conquest. They abuse the weak and quickly cower beneath
        the strong. Ideas and objects unrelated to war have no
        value to an Orc. They are the mortal enemies of Dwarves
        and Elves, and seek to slay them whenever possible.</font></p>

        small, burly, creatures have been spotted deep in the
        caverns beneath Kaladim, lurking about in the shadows,
        and stalking the mining crews. Many a Dwarven Miner's
        disappearance has been attributed to these foul beings,
        whose only fear seems to be bright light. Rumor has it
        that these creatures may actually be Dwarves -- perhaps
        even the missing Miners -- that were bitten by strange
        bats that live in the deep mines and caverns, inflicting
        their victims with the curse of Lycanthropy. Or, maybe
        the sharp claws and long, dripping, fangs of the Werebats
        themselves are responsible for this curse.</font></p>

        mages of immense power. But while they are both
        intelligent and strong willed, they all possess an
        unexplained and curious weakness -- experienced wizards
        and sorcerers of Norrath have been known to summon them
        from their native plane and imprison them in sealed rooms
        and smaller devices. Some legends speak of fantastic
        rewards for those who release a djinn, yet others speak
        of the violent deaths of those who unleash them.</font></p>

        size="4">Of the myriad of giants that dwell in Norrath,
        Sand Giants are perhaps the most curious. They, unlike
        other giant-kin, are nomadic and dwell almost always in
        the desert or other dry and dusty locales. And while they
        are not overtly evil in their nature (one would never
        find Sand Giants raiding towns or other civilized areas),
        they are fiercely xenophobic. Their distrust of other
        races borders on the paranoid and many adventurers have
        sealed their fates in death by accidentally coming across
        a Sand Giant settlement while exploring. The fact that
        these settlements move and could be anywhere makes desert
        questing all the more perilous.</font></p>
