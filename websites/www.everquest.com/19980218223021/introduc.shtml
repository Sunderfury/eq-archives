        face="Times New Roman Cyr">Welcome to the world of
        EverQuest, a real 3-D massively multi-player fantasy
        role-playing game. Prepare to enter an enormous virtual
        environment &#150; an entire world with its own diverse
        species, economic systems, alliances, and politics.
        Choose from a variety of races and classes, and begin
        your quest in any number of cities or villages throughout
        several continents. From there, equip yourself for
        adventure, seek allies and knowledge, and head out into a
        rich world of dungeons, towers, crypts, evil abbeys --
        anything conceivable -- even planes and realities beyond
        your imagination. Learn skills, earn experience, acquire
        treasure and equipment, meet friends and encounter
        enemies. A multitude of quests and adventures await, but
        you choose your role, you define your destiny. But
        whether you make yourself a noble human knight, a vicious
        dark elf thief, a greedy dwarven merchant, or whatever
        suits your desire, remember one thing:</font></p>
