<p><font size="3">The Closed Beta will be the first EverQuest
test to involve members of the general public. Select individuals
chosen by the EverQuest team, as well as in-house testers, and
the team itself, will participate in these trials. The EverQuest
closed testing periods will be in several phases, each successive
phase involving more and more people. In early March, we will
begin accepting applications for all phases of closed testing.</font></p>

<p align="center">*NOTE: we are <strong>NOT</strong> accepting
applications for beta testing at this time. Please do <strong>NOT</strong>
email us beta applications*</p>
