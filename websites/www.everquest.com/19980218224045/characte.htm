<p><font size="4"><strong>Characters</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Georgia">When you play EverQuest you'll
first create a character. This creation of yours can be any one
of 12 races and 14 classes (keep in mind that not all races can
be all classes), male or female, and you even have the
opportunity to adjust your attributes (for instance, how strong
you are, or how intelligent you aren't). You'll then immerse this
character of yours into our virtual world and make of him or her
whatever you wish. The following are descriptions of each of the
races and classes you can play.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Races</strong></font></p>

<p><b>Human - </b>Normal humans. The standard race by which all
others are judged.</p>

<p><b>Barbarian - </b>A hardier variety of the Human race that
comes from the cold and rugged northlands. Because of the harsh
environment, and their warlike culture, they are better suited to
being Warriors than Humans, and are generally unwashed and rugged
&#150; possessing very few social graces. </p>

<p><b>Erudite (High Man) - </b>The final variant of the Human
race. Being the exact opposite of the Barbarians, the High Man
prides himself on his intellectual abilities and social graces,
to the almost total exclusion of the physical disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Woodland Elf - </b>The Elves appear somewhat human at first
glance, but their very sharp features and pointed ears set them
apart. Elves are weaker than humans, but more than make up for
this with their amazing agility and superior dexterity. They
equal the High Man in their intelligence and wisdom, but are much
more fair and charismatic. </p>

<p><b>High Elf - </b>The High Elves are much more intellectual
than their Woodland kin, and are the &quot;royalty&quot; of the
Elven races (with the exception of their Dark brethren). They
share the appearance of their Woodland kin, but are thinner, more
beautiful, and more pale in skin. </p>

<p><b>Dark Elf - </b>The evil brethren of the Woodland and High
Elves. Their skin is blueish-black, their hair white, and they
share the pointed ears and sharp features of their Elven
brethren. Due to their life under the earth, and dedication to
evil gods, they have the ability to see perfectly in the dark .</p>

<p><b>Half-Elf - </b>Half-Elves, being a blend between humans and
Woodland Elves, share some of the strengths and weaknesses of
both races. They most closely resemble humans, except for their
slightly pointed ears and sharper facial features. </p>

<p><b>Dwarf - </b>Dwarves are short, but extremely strong (much
more so than Humans) and dexterous. They appear to be small,
burly humans, and are never seen without beards and mustaches. </p>

<p><b>Troll - </b>Trolls typically stand about 8&#146; tall, are
extremely strong, ugly, stupid, dirty, and green of skin. </p>

<p><b>Ogre - </b>Ogres are incredibly massive beings, with their
average height being about 10&#146;, and weigh well over four
hundred pounds, which makes them a truly immovable object. Due to
their size, they are the strongest of all the races and are tied
with the Trolls in pure Stamina. Conversely, they are the
stupidest race, whose lives mostly consist of smashing things and
eating them. </p>

<p><b>Halfling - </b>Halflings are stocky little people that most
closely resemble humans, but they are extremely agile, dexterous,
and very light of foot.</p>

<p><b>Gnome - </b>Gnomes spend most of their lives in their
underground burrows and rarely come to the surface. They resemble
Dwarves to some extent, but have a ruddy brown skin and are more
wiry and gnarled. Their hair is white, and somewhat sparse.</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Classes</strong></font></p>

<p><b>Warrior - </b>Warriors are the masters of armed combat, in
all its many forms. They are at home on the battlefield, and are
trained to take punishment as much as dole it out, so their Hit
Points are the highest of any class. </p>

<p><b>Cleric - </b>The Cleric is a holy man endowed by his patron
deity with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon
the wrath of his deity to smite his foes. Prayer is how the
Cleric gains his ability.</p>

<p><b>Paladin - </b>Paladins are the very picture of a holy
knight, fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of his
life. They share some of the power of a Cleric, and a good deal
of the fighting ability of a Warrior, but have a few powers all
their own. </p>

<p><b>Ranger - </b>The Ranger is a meld between a Warrior and a
Druid, sharing some of the skills of both. They are at home in
the outdoors.</p>

<p><b>Shadow Knight - </b>The evil twin to the Paladin class,
Shadow Knights derive all of their powers from the evil gods whom
they serve. They are a meld of Warrior and Necromancer, and share
some of their abilities and spells. </p>

<p><b>Druid - </b>A Druid is completely at home in the outdoors,
and is a friend to all animals. Because of this, no animal will
ever attack him unless first attacked by the Druid. They are
spellcasters whose focus is all things natural, allowing them to
call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with
their Ranger brothers.</p>

<p><b>Monk - </b>Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of shaping
their bodies into a pure weapon, and because of this they nearly
shun all weapons and most forms of armor. They are very religious
as well, and the gods are known to bless them, not by prayers and
spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks.</p>

<p><b>Bard - </b>The Bard&#146;s stock-in-trade is his ability to
play songs. His songs are actually spells of a sort, and their
magical affects last as long as the Bard continues to sing and
play the correct instrument. They have some passing knowledge of
the Warrior ways (mainly for self-defense), but their main focus
is always their art, and so they will never be as skillful as
Warriors.</p>

<p><b>Rogue - </b>They are the secretive, mysterious class of the
world, who sneak about in the dark. Some say they are assassins,
and some that they are nothing but common thieves, but the truth
lies somewhere in the middle, and they are capable of both. They
are quite skilled with many weapons, but they cannot stand toe to
toe with a Warrior and prefer to make the kill by a sudden attack
from the rear, at which they are extremely skilled. They would
much prefer to not be discovered at all, or if they are, to not
be there for their opponent&#146;s blow to land. The darker
skills of picking locks and stealing are also their forte.</p>

<p><b>Shaman - </b>They are similar to the Cleric, but are more
of a tribal witch doctor and are typically found amongst the more
primitve races. Their primary focus is largely healing and other
Clerical type spells, but they also have a good deal of offensive
spells.</p>

<p><b>Necromancer - </b>These are the dark brotherhood of the
arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spiritually based
spells, they are able to animate dead bodies and skeletons to do
their bidding, as well as having spells which leach life from
their victims. </p>

<p><b>Wizard - </b>Wizards are the master seekers of knowledge,
and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use
powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to
transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge
has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of
defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability
to do magical damage, they have no rivals.</p>

<p><b>Magician - </b>Magicians are the summoners of the arcane
arts, and wield the power to call forth everything from a loaf of
bread to a huge Fire Elemental to fight for them. While not as
adept at offensive spells as the Wizards, Magicians still wield
considerable power in this area as well.</p>

<p><b>Enchanter - </b>The primary focus of the Enchanter&#146;s
art can be summed up by the name of the arcane order to which he
belongs: Enchanter. Their spells are crafted to enchant people,
places, and things. This art allows them to charm beings and make
them fight for their new master, or magically enhance the
capabilities of a sword. They also have some skill in offensive
spells, but are never as skilled as a Wizard.</p>
