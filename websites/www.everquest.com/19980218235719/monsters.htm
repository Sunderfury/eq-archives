        through the very crust of Norrath in search of prey, the
        Skulking Brute is a creature of unrelenting hunger. Many
        brave adventurers have fallen beneath a Brute's onslaught
        of hammering fists and gnashing teeth. From where the
        Skulking Brutes originate is unknown but rumors abound.
        Some say they are the creation of a mad Erudite wizard
        while others claim they were made by Brell Serilis
        himself. On one point all can agree: it is best to be
        where a Skulking Brute isn't.</font></p>

        size="4">If this creature even exists, most would argue
        it lives between the Planes, in the Great Void, leaving
        this place only to hunt. But since no mortal can survive
        that void, the location of the beast's lair must remain
        unproven. Legend says the magical creature teleports to
        its prey at night, stinging and poisoning with its
        tentacles. The victim, still able to slowly move, becomes
        then the toy of this feline monster, and eventually, of
        course, its meal.</font></p>

        woe to any who stumble upon one uninvited. Pray that the
        dragon dissects you with talons and teeth, for if you are
        exposed to its breath your demise will be slow and
        excruciatingly painful. Your flesh will blacken and
        blister until it slides free from your bones. Yes, you'll
        find yourself wishing for a quick death by claw or fang.</font></p>

        similar in appearance, yet smaller and usually armless.
        While more intelligent than most creatures, they are far
        from possessing the intellect of their draconian kin.
        Wyverns are mute and merely fierce fighters, unlike
        dragons, which are capable of speech and even sorcery.</font></p>
