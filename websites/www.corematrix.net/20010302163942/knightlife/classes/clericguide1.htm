         <P><!-- BEGIN ACTUAL CONTENT BLOCK --><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Guide
         to playing a cleric</B></FONT></P>
         
         <P><B>Introduction</B></P>
         
         <P>So, you're interested in playing a cleric? Why Play a
         cleric, you say??</P>
         
         <P>Because, what other spell-casting class can wear
         platemail? None! Being able to wear that gives you access to
         some of the best armor in the game. Plus, they are At LEAST
         average fighers. Highly under-rated in that area. But,
         clerics arn't really great spell-casters you say? You are
         wrong. Clerics posses the BEST healing skills in the game.
         No other classes may area-heal or heal to full hit points.
         Clerics can do both at higher levels. And, they posses the
         best spells-against-undead in the game. You'd be quite
         suprised by how good the clerics direct damage spells do.
         and amazed by the undead ones. Clerics also have, the best
         hit points buff in the game. Not to mention an average
         amount of hit points int he first place, not quite a warrior
         or ranger, but far higher then a wizard or enchanter....At
         higher levels, they have spells that can give characters
         hundreds of extra hit points. And finally...... there is no
         better feeling then saving ones life. And you are the best
         at doing it in the game.</P>
         
         <P><B>Chosing your race</B></P>
         
         <P>The races a cleirc may be are:</P>
         
         <P>Dark Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, Gnome, Halfling, High Elf,
         Human.</P>
         
         <P>Each is different and better in their own ways. Humans
         advance quicker then all other races. a big plus.</P>
         
         <P>Dwarves probably have the best attributes for clerics.
         High Elves posses good attributes for a cleric, whilst still
         having high intelligence. A very important attribute in the
         world of Norrath. Erudites posses very high intelligence and
         wisdom. Halflings are probably the second best attributes
         for clerics, and gnomes the 3rd.</P>
         
         <P>You may also wish to pick your race based on personal
         prefrence, rather then attributes and the like... I chose
         dwarf.</P>
         
         <P><B>Chosing your attributes</B></P>
         
         <P>Clerics main attribute is wisdom. I suggest you put most
         of your points there. I cannot stress that enough, with my
         great ability to wear platemail.</P>
         
         <P>I thought I'd dump my points into agility, because, they
         can't hurt you if they can't hit you right? wrong. Npc's
         spells still do, and theres more important things then
         missing hits...though Clerics are experts in the feild of
         dodging and armor, they are best at spells. And clerics
         derrive their mana from wisdom. For the first 20 levels that
         extra agility was great, but as you get higher, you become
         more of a caster and less of a warrior.</P>
         
         <P>After that wisdom, I reccomend putting the last into
         strength.</P>
         
         <P><B>Starting out</B></P>
         
         <P>Well, the first few levels are by far the easiest. and
         you don't even really need any damage spells, just give
         yourself courage, and melee everything.</P>
         
         <P>You may want to buy Strike for lvl 3 or 4 tho.</P>
         
         <P>For the first couple of gold, buy yourself your first
         melee weapon (other then the starting one).</P>
         
         <P>And, now, we have come to what is probably the hardest
         dicesion for a cleric. What kind of weapon? 1H or 2H blunt?
         People can fight for hours about which is better, but
         neither will ever win. By the time I figured out what was
         best to do, I was far to high a level to do it. but you can,
         Keep your weapon skill level maxed per level at both 1 and
         2h blunt. Always keep both a 1handed and 2handed blunt
         weapon on you, and everytime you level, quickly max the
         skill out, and then fight with your preferered kind.</P>
         
         <P>Many think, hey, 2H blunt does more damage so it must be
         better. And it does do more damage, but is not better. Nor
         is 1H better then 2H. Damage is not all that counts. 1Hblunt
         lets you use a sheild. And there are many VERY good sheilds
         out there, like ones that bring up wisdom. That is VERY
         important, because as I said, you become more of a caster as
         you get higher. And I don't mean just some wisdom. I mean,
         lots. With both a 1H blunt weapon and sheild with wisdom
         boosters, you can get 15+ more wisdom. That helps ALOT.</P>
         
         <P>And the extra AC on the sheild is good too. So, its best
         you just stay maxed at both. Use a 2H blunt weapon against
         those weak opponents you can melee against, and the spells
         against those strong ones you need mana to root and cast
         against. By the way, for clerics, the max skill per lvl in
         1H and 2H blunt, is:</P>
         
         <P>Your level, x4 +4. Example: For lvl 8 it'd be 32 (4x8)
         +4. (36).</P>
         
         <P><B>Advancing</B></P>
         
         <P>As time progresses you will gain your 5th lvl. By now you
         should be fimiliar with the spell system and should be able
         to buy new spells with money you've saved up. Speaking of
         that. For clerics, money isn't easy. You need to buy
         weapons, spells and armor. All of which becomes very
         expensive.</P>
         
         <P>But if you listen to my reccomendations and fight the
         things with good loot, money shoudn't be a problem. (having
         afew good friends who can lend you money from time to time
         isn't bad either) The best places to hunt as a cleric are
         places with undead. And its worth moving around alot for the
         extra money/easy kills you get by finding them.</P>
         
         <P>The best place for undead is kaladim, the dwarf home or
         Freeport, the human home. If you do not pick a human or
         dwarf. Then I reccomend you go to one of those two cities
         once you reach 5th lvl and can probably make the trips
         safely. I reccomend kaladim, but if you chose freeport, The
         dungeon befallen (located in west commonlands) is good for
         lvls 5 and up. But it gets boring quick in there. The latest
         you'll ever be able to stay there without going mad is lvl
         20. I reccomend taking the the other route, which is:
         Kaladim</P>
         
         <P>From 5th lvl up, once obtaining the damage-against-undead
         spell, ward undead, Hunt Dwarf Skeletons at the skeleton
         tower.</P>
         
         <P>Ask for driections in kaladim to it if you don't know
         where it is. Its near the cross-roads. I reccomend that
         until 8th or 9th level. Now, if you've stayed till lvl 9
         like I reccomend, you can buy some new spells. Center, which
         is very useful, ROOT, which some say, is the best spell in
         the game, and afew useful others.</P>
         
         <P>Then head to Steamfont Mountains (ask for directions) and
         kill dwarf skeletons past the Minotaur Caves (ask for
         directions). They are around your level. Then, at level 10
         or 11 go kill undead pawns at the chessboard. They should
         all be blue or green to you by now. It is located in
         ButcherBlock Mountains near the Greater faydark zone (ask
         for driections). Every couple of spawns you'll find undead
         knights and bishops. usualy one or two levels higher then
         the others. Sometimes the Undead King spawns too. That isn't
         always good tho, I think he's level 13-15. Anyways, after
         that, I reccomend you go to a place called Highpass Hold.
         Far away. Past freeport, in between it and qeynos. Its
         located beside Kithicor Forest (a hunting ground near
         Rivervale). If you go in the actualy city, High Keep, there
         is a prison.</P>
         
         <P>That is a GREAT place for levels 13, 14 ad 15. The
         prisoners are easy. And if you get in too much danger, just
         go into the cell with the princess and they can't hit ya.
         rest, and med, and go fight again. Once you reach 15 or 16
         its time to do your first long stay in on place.</P>
         
         <P>This place is one of my favourtie places on Norrath, Near
         freeport also, in between South and North desert of Ro. The
         Oasis of Marr.</P>
         
         <P>So, go from highpass, to oasis, and kill orc warirors.
         (don't bother with the preists, they are mostly the same
         level and much harder) You can ussualy find a nice spot near
         the oasis (lake with the spectre-island)</P>
         
         <P>By then you will have smite, 80 damage plus, and healing,
         heals 80 damage plus, and root, and center.</P>
         
         <P>When you are lvl 19, most of the orcs will be green. So
         it'll be hard experience, and even at 18 several orcs will
         be green. But it'd be more then worth the wait at lvl 20
         when you get a lastname and much more to do.</P>
         
         <P>I reccomend staying there till level 20. Then, its time
         to start adventuring. You can still find high level undead
         in Unrest near Kaladim, but you can now travel to ALOT more
         of the world. And you'll find it alot more fun playing
         EverQuest.</P>
         
         <P><B>Armor, weapons, spells</B></P>
         
         <P>As for buying armor and weapons and spells. Spells are
         very expensive, but if you borrow some money from good
         friends afew times, you should do alright. The monsters I
         reccomended you fight all give reasonably good loot. And as
         for armor, stick with your patchwork or leather till about
         6th, 7th lvl, when you've bought your 5th spells and can
         afford abit of ringmail.</P>
         
         <P>After that, save up for your nineth level spells, and
         after that, you can start buying bronze. Bronze armor is a
         type of platemail that some clerics keep all their
         lives.</P>
         
         <P>Keep saving up for spells tho, they become more and more
         expensive all the time. Only buy the ones you use of course.
         Now it comes to one of the last parts of my guide. Armor.
         There are two different routes a cleric may take: The
         "Buffing armor" and the "AC armor". AC armor is ussualy the
         one clerics take till around level 20. Then, you start
         wanting more wisdom for spells, and they start ditching that
         heavy bronze armor for light attribute rising armor. Always
         very expensive, but ussualy worth it. There isn't really
         much more I can say about that. You don't have to switch.
         But I reccomend you do, afew examples of such items are:
         Lizardscale Cloak. BloodStained Mantle. BloodStained Tunic.
         etc etc. They all bring up attributes and help alot in the
         long run. Start looking for them around level 20+, thats
         when they start becoming quite useful and affordable.</P>
         
         <P>I'd post some spells here, but it'd be pointless, for the
         BEST Cleric web page out there has ALL the cleric info. This
         is not an advertisement, I'm just a cleric who loved this
         site. It has all the quest info, the FULL spell list, and
         tons of guides for clerical hunting.</P>
         
         <P>The webpage is: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric">http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric</A></P>
         
         <P>If you wanna be a cleric, or already are one, I strongly
         reccomend you go there, if you have any questions on
         clerics, my guide, or just EQ itself, (I am quite
         experienced with the game, been playing since November 98)
         Send me an e-mail at the adress below.</P>

         to the world!</P>
