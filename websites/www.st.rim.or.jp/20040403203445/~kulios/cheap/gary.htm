GOODBYE JAPAN<br><br>

All good things must come to an end. That's how the old saying goes this side of the ocean. An ending is the only thing one can be sure of when embarking upon any ventureÅcbusiness, marriage, even life itself, which of course, is the ultimate experience which, in death, has the ultimate ending.<br><br>

I have reached an ending.<br><br>

Five years ago, I made my first trip to Japan. It was for World Championships in Tokyo, the single greatest Magic event I've ever attended. I scheduled twelve days, not knowing I'd be returning to the island four more times over the next four years, and upon arriving, found myself lost. Japan isn't the easiest country for a Canadian to get around: the amount of English spoken in your country is less than most, and the clumsy English-Japanese dictionary I carried being the tourist I was back then wasn't providing much help. <br><br>

Slowly, surely, I found my way to the right train and then to the right station. Japanese train stations are a maze to me: a mess of pretty sounds, foreign lettering and thousands of people rushing past me faster than my eyes can comprehend, but finally, I caught up to one man, small, elderly: he saw I needed help and waited patiently as I pulled out the dictionary and managed the following:<br><br>

Where<br><br>

Is<br><br>

Taxi?<br><br><br>


I was carrying two large suit cases, one full of light clothing, the other full of heavy Magic cards and books, and the man immediately moved forward and took them from me. He started walking and I could see he was struggling with the weight, and I tried to take the heavy case back from him but he shook me off. I was starting to worry about why he'd taken the bags: In Canada and more in the States, this would be a very unusual  act, and my mind was starting to race. We started up a flight of stairs, then a second, then a third and a fourth, by which point the man was definitely in trouble but still refusing my help. Finally, at the top of the fourth flight, I found myself emerging from the station at an outdoor taxi stand. He carried the bags to the first taxi in line, placed them in the trunk, nodded, smiled and left.<br><br>

What a country.<br><br>

This is Japan as I see it: the most foreign of lands with the greatest people in the world. I wish I could say I'll definitely be back.<br><br>

You see, I'm quitting Magic.<br><br>

This is my ending.<br><br>

Kobe was the last overseas trip I'll be making as a professional Magic player, and I'll be done at the end of this season. More than seven years ago, at 23 years of age, I went to Pro Tour Dallas as the new kid. Now, 40-some Pro Tours and $125000 later, the game has passed me by. I'm a 31 year old man in a 20-year old's game and it's been showing throughout the season. I'm playing worse now than I did in Dallas, back when unbeknownst to me, I didn't know what I was doing. Now, I do, but it's the wrong stuff: After playing as hard as I have for as long as I have, Magic is no longer a game; it's a job, and not a well-paying one now that I'm no longer with the Sideboard. <br><br>

When I was younger, I was one of the top five drafters in the world. Back then the secret was going onto IRC and doing ten drafts every day at a time when very few people were doing ten a week. Since Magic Online came out, it seems like everyone does those same ten drafts, except for me. I've found that these days I need to play live or at least be able to discuss strategy in order to truly learn from my drafts, and no one plays live here any more. Not that it would matter if they did: after playing the same game for almost nine years, playing competitively just isn't something I want to do any more. The whole thing has become repetitive, and aside from the people, I don't get much enjoyment out of it any more. I've moved on to another game (Poker) which is a little more suitable to my age bracket: I guess we can't be young forever.<br><br>

My purpose in writing this article is to say thank you. Thank you to old friends like Koichiro Maki, Tsuyoshi Fujita, Tsuyoshi Ikeda, Keita Mori and Jin Okamoto, who make it out to every Pro Tour and manage to communicate warmth despite the obvious language barriers. Goodbye to newer friends like Masashiro Kuroda and Yoshiya Shindo, both of whom have been so helpful with translation over the years and so recently bloomed into more than what they once were. Goodbye to my newest friends like my good luck charm Asami, who repeatedly beat me to a pulp during Kobe, showing me in part how right my decision is. Most of all, I want to thank the readers who have supported me through the years. You can't know what an honor it is to know your words hold importance to a people who you respect and adore while living half a world away.<br><br>

I take a small amount of pride in Kuroda's victory in Kobe, hoping that in some small way, my writing had something to do with his development as a player to the champion he is now. I'm so happy I got to see the completion of Japan's emergence as a Magic power, as evidenced by his victory. I think that in some way, the pride I feel is not unlike that of the distant parent reveling in their child's success, and as a person who has chosen to go forth alone in this world, that feeling is of a greater value to me than you know.<br><br>

I'm going to end this now. I could go on for pages, but that would be undignified, and I'd start repeating myself and rambling and I don't want to go out that way. I've seldom heard from my Japanese readers in the past, but if any of you want to contact me, my e-mail address is <a href="mailto:JGaryWise@yahoo.com">JGaryWise@yahoo.com</a>. It will be good to have one last contact with this country and its people, who I've grown to respect so much.<br><br>

Thank you and keep gaming.<br><br>

The end.<br><br>
