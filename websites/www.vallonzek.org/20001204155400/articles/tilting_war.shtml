Many people are wondering what race to be on Tallon Zek.  There are many 
things you can account for when choosing your race, stats, night vision, 
newbie hunting grounds, and roleplaying reasons.  But there is another aspect 
that many are not accounting for: Number of comrades.

In this article I tried my best to find out two main things, first how are 
the teams balanced, and second why so many people were siding with the forces 
of darkness.

Part 1:  The Balance of the Cosmos

Several people seem to think that a certain teams are too powerful or too 
weak.  I've found from my experience that the teams are fairly equal (I would 
like to take this moment to state that all of my articles are my opinions, 
this includes the area's that I say are in a races territory.  If you 
disagree that is fine your opinions are as valid as mine.  In other words, no 
flames please  =) ).

Lets start with the Human team.  This is the most even class out of all.  
Reason being that they have EVERY class in the game on their team.  Although 
the MAJOR drawback of this team is that they are blind as bats plain and 
simple, none of them have night vision.  There are also some minor class 
problems with the teams.  For example the Erudite Necromancers are killed on 
sight in all cities except Erudin.  Hopefully this will be changed in some 
way or another.  Area's which they control are huge!  It spans from all of 
Odus, to the Karana's (perhaps even Highpass), to the Frigid Plains and 
Permafrost, and to the northern area of Lake Rathe (maybe all of it).  Medium 
armor will be controlled by them, luckily it is what they mostly use(at least 
2/3 of them).  This team is even and clean cut, perfect team to join if you 
want even out groups.

Now the ones of the underfoot, or as I call them, the midgets or  shorties 
(no offense).  Surprisingly most of them will have more lust for blood and 
war than even the Dark Elves!  2/3 of this team will be in constant battle 
from day 1.  Sorry but I can't tell what area's they can control other than 
the newbie zones and places like Runneye, since I have never played one 
beyond level 9, but I can tell you that they will have the greatest supply of 
Mino Axes, and Squad Rings.  Several more major magical items will be in 
their power.  They have most of the classes to use, but not shamans,  Monks 
(Obvious), rangers, and shadowknights (not positive about rangers and 
shadowknights... think so though).  If you really want to do some major PvP 
and if you want to gain glory through trials of battle, I really advise you 
to join the children of Brell... or.....

The Elves.  Rivals to the Midgets.  This team will be mostly build up of 
Druids, Bards, and Enchanters.  If you are really considering joining this 
team, I'm praying for you.  On first day Greater Faydark will probably crash, 
and there will be kill stealing to tremendous degree.  Perhaps I am wrong, I 
hope I am ... then again... The entire team will start out in the same zone.  
This can be both good and bad...  Good because if an army of basically 
ANYTHING comes and attacks them, they have to deal with the entire team, and 
not just 1/3 or 2/3 of one.  Bad because it will be crowded, and there is 
nothing worse than an angry High Elf that keeps getting his steals killed.  
On a regular server (or "blue") when they first open Greater Faydark has 
about 100-300 people in it.  With the population of Tallon Zek being 
approximated at 3000-6000... well I think you get the point.  Still look on 
the bright side you do have the female Wood Elves to look forward to. ; D

Lastly the dwellers of darkness, the pinnacles of evil, the "mean team," yes 
folks it's the bad guys.  These guys will make up about 35% of the server 
(according to several survey's and from what I've heard in chat).  If you 
want to have comfort in numbers then this is a team you really should join.  
Although there is one problem.  The issue of quantity over quality comes up.  
There could be over 1000 people on this team (it is very well possible) and 
newbie zones can only take so many people.  The greatest place with over 
population as a problem is Nekatos, Dark Elf newbie hunting ground.  Now 
there is a way to truly avoid the crowd if you know your zones well.  This is 
also an even class except for one thing.  No tracking at all.  No class in 
this team gets tracking.  Sure they get some location spells like Locate 
Undead and what not, but still, it isn't exactly tracking.  They also lack in 
healing a bit, sure they have clerics who are the king and queens of healers, 
and shamans are ok at it too, but they don't have Paladins and Lay Hands 
helps out big time early on.  This is also the "get everyone else mad at us" 
team.  About a month into the server this team will really hit everyone else 
hard.  Many paladins dream about Ghoulbane, but on Tallon it will be just 
that, only a dream.  Sure if you want to play cheap you can get one, but that 
just takes the fun out of Tallon Zek, and makes it some cheap team quake.  
Back to items, other things they control are Mesh, Netted, and Woven armor.  
You can get these in other area's but it is MUCH harder.  Several Magic users 
will have a pain getting Woven armor also.

Basically it comes down to one phrase that many die hard PSX and N64 gamers 
are already familiar with.  Quality Vs. Quantity.  Every team has something 
for every level.  It's a matter of if you want safety in numbers, or safety 
in strength.  Sure a Dark Elf can keep up level wise with a Human, but it 
will be harder than it was for the Human as well.

Now some have wondered why people would lean towards the side of evil for the 
Race War and not for the other servers ... well read on friend and see the 
thoughts of NeoGoku...

"You Don't Know the Power of the Dark Side!"

There are many reasons people may want to be evil.  There is always the self 
evident roleplaying that people love to do, but there may be more.  On a 
regular server you may want to go away from your town and go to different 
lands, and even perhaps enemy territory, but on the regular servers you are 
at risk of being killed by guards, not being able to sell your items to 
NPC's, and the danger of named NPC's like Holly Windstalker and Cros 
Treewind.  BUT on Tallon Zek this is not the case ... well it is the same, 
but at the same time very different.  You most definitely will not be heading 
into enemy territory anytime alone, unless you are prepared to die, are very 
brave, or very stupid.

Now NPC's don't matter, it's the NPC's you need to worry about.  All the 
Humans can still go to Rivervale, but I doubt they will have time to hunt in 
Runneye before having a train of PC Halflings screaming "Kill the pig! Spill 
his blood! Bash his head!".  This is why people will be the evil races!

It is in an odd way easier.  The original difficulty settings that say how 
hard a Race\Class combo is to play do not apply the same way on Tallon Zek 
(with the exception of Erudite Necromancers).  For example, take an Erudite 
Wizard, and a Dark Elf Wizard.  Which will have an easier time playing?  Some 
may say the Dark Elf because they have night vision, some may say the Erudite 
because he can sell to more vendors and has more mana.  BUT The Erudite won't 
step foot outside of his territory of the people who already are on his team 
without help from others.  SO THEY ARE VIRTUALLY EQUAL! (Huzzah!) So all 
those people who always wanted to be evil but were afraid because of the 
difficulty rating, ignore it.

Another reason people may want to be evil are the superior stats they begin 
with for certain classes.  Lets face it, in most cases people will say a 
Troll Shadowknight is better than a Human Shadowknight.  It could go both 
ways, but in a head on fight I'd put my platinum on the Troll and Ogre.

So to sum up, why do so many people play evil?  They want to roleplay, want 
higher stats with less difficulty, and the ever rare "I wanna be like Darth 
Maul" Star Wars maniac.

NOTE: They do not have high stats for all classes such as Enchanters in 
particular, you need Charisma to charm creatures and Dark Elves aren't 
exactly known for their people skills...

Hopefully I showed how the server will be balanced, or how it is not 
depending on how you felt by my writing.  This is how I see it  at least in 
my own eye's.  One aspect that I haven't covered was the factor of 
roleplaying, just too many biases and too little time.

Hope to see you all on Tallon soon!!
