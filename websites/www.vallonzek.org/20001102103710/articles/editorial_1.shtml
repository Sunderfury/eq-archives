   First Let me start off by saying I love everquest it is one of the best games I have ever played. There were many talented people who
where brought together to create this game and it is appriciated.
 
    Since Tallon Zek was first announced there has almost been a mass cult following surrounding it. There are more Web Sites and
Guilds for it than any other server brought up to date. I find it very hard to believe that Verant had no clue that the server was going to
be overloaded. They even took a poll about it. The message from Mr. Smedley was that the poll was only taken to see if people would
play. For him to say that this poll was not to see how many people would play but, to see if people would play at all and that they did
not count how many players said yes, they would be playing is a insult on my intelligence and everyone else who was there. There is
no way you can tell me that the Tallon Zek poll did not give them a idea of how many people were going to play.
 
    So once the server was shut down and Mr. Smedley came on to proclaim that "they had no idea it was going to be this popular"
some very good solutions were brought up such as a player cap, no cap and let it run and what i believe to be the best solution at the
time covert the test server over to a real server and make it the new Race War Server. Mr. Smedley said no to the first two but paused 
for the test server idea. then he came back and said it was to valuable to them to convert it. Even though they planned on getting a
new server within a week they could not live without the test server that seems strange since only 150 people play on the test server
and over 5000+ were angry at Tallon Zek being shut down.
 
    While there were people cussing and swearing at Mr. Smedley in the main general chat room and spamming like i have never seen
before and Mr. Smedley ignored them and contuinued on. Then i made a stament that went something like this.
 
ME: Verant how stupid do you think we are there is no way that you could not know the server was going to be this busy once you
have proven that the customer does not come first only that money is king around here
 
I got a immediate private message from Mr. Smedly i dont know it word for word but this is VERY close to what was said to mw
 
SMED: Listen dude i dont want to hear any more crap like that from you.
 
    Out of all the people there using every vulgar word in the book at him he decided to choose me to vent on. He immediatley shut me
up so i could not talk again. after he left i told everyone and no one else claimed to have recieved a message from him which i found to
be very strange because it seemed to me that he was making a threat to ban me for my statement.
 
    Now think of this. Verant has been hyping Tallon Zek for weeks. Ask your self this how many of you were ready to not re-subscribe
to everquest and go to one of the many new online RPG's that are in beta then Tallon Zek was announced. How many of you have
re-subscribed in the last few weeks waiting for it. Its the end of the month now and many players free month of EQ has expired. What
better way to keep people paying who otherwise would not than by luring them in with a server that you know will have well over
5,000 people who want to play. Then give them a teaser one day knowing full well the server could not handle it but knowing that even
more people will get involved with it. Then drag them on for another week or so and yes you may get a few people who quit but you
are going to get even more people who dont even play EQ but hear about that the server that is so popular they could not keep it up.
 
    In closing i want to say that yes i heard the were some rude gm's in the chat rooms but over all most of the Gm's handled themselves
in a very respectful manner i was not glad to see them take such a bashing as they did but i have to also say that alot of people needed
to vent after that fiasco. Players need to remember that the normal GM's have nothing to do with what Verant does, heck they dont
even get paid! I just find it very very suspicious that every thing went they way it did friday the Verant staff are not stupid they had to
see the writting on the wall 90% of the people who planned on playing knew that one server would not be enough why didn't vernat. 
 
    Well who know what will happen from here I am sure that once my little rant get posted somewhere and a certain someone hears
about it that i may not be welcome on the EQ servers anymore but, I had to speak my mind and there are others that i have disscused
this with and they agree with me. Let me also say that i have no true facts to back this up that it could just be a big coincendence but i
really dont believe that.
