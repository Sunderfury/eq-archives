Ok I realize some of you are really pissed at Verant for this whole thing, I 
am too in a way. Yes, they should have taken into account the fact that the 
TZ chat was always packed, and that there were surveys up the yin-yang about 
people going to play and similar things. Ok, now on the the part people dont 
get.

Now yes you pay for this game, and yes you want Verant to put the server up, 
whether with a player amount cap or not, but there are a few things you have 
to realize about a game server and the companies who run them.

1. The server is a computer, just like the one you have, it has restrictions 
and similar problems like your computer. A game server is one that is tweaked 
to hell to accomidate so many players, the EQ servers being a perfect 
example. A computer, server side or not can only be stressed so much that it 
will bog down playability so much as to hamper the players experience. 
2. Telling Verant they are idiots isnt gonna help your cause out that much. 
Believe me, they already have your money, so not like its gonna matter too 
much how much you petition with strong hostile intents, people arent gonna 
respond to that. In the real world, you are more likely to get a response, 
good or not if you are kind to the person you are complaining to. Be nice to 
Smed, Fippy and the rest of them, and maybe they will help you out. Otherwise 
your little attempts at childish petitions arent gonna help them to crank out 
the server any faster.
3. One week is all it will take. Or at least thats the minimum. They did of 
course give you the server at their given ETA, so maybe they will give you 
the both of them at the same time within the week, that is of course if like 
I said before, you dont petition like crazy.
4. Maturity is a big part of this game, and although most of you are probably 
adults, but I have seen some really childish rants from people whom I thought 
were smarter than that. Yelling at Smed and spamming him like hell isnt gonna 
get you on his good side, or anyone elses for that matter. Just try to act 
like you would if your grandparents came over in chat, it makes for a much 
friendlier environment.

Think of this as Christmas Eve for a Week, and when it finally hits that 12 
midnight tone on the old grandfather clock, maybe you will double your 
presents for X-Mas, with a choice of servers, there will be greater 
playability. 
Anyways, if you feel like spamming my mailbox to hell, go right ahead, im not 
gonna stop you. I just hope you take some of my opinions into consideration 
the next time you see Smed and the rest in chat, and think twice before 
telling him off
