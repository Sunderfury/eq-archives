<PRE>
With the new Race War server coming many people have been asking questions.  
I was also curious on what it would be like, so I logged on to the test 
server and gave it a go.

Choosing a race was an odd and difficult decision, in the end I chose a Dark 
Elf Magician named Trunks.  After hunting up to level 2 I heard the cries of 
fellow Teir'Dal's, "Meet at bridge!  We will destroy the Freeport Scum!!!"  I 
though I'd join in, heck it was the reason I wanted to come to the test 
server anyway.  So we set off most were merely level 1-5 but we had a few 
level 20's as well.

Upon arriving in Freeport we attacked, we took down several humans, and a 
High Elf here and there.  Then several Dark Elves had to leave for real life 
things, and so the attack fell apart.

Eventually the Teir'Dal were driven back, but we weren't finished yet.  We 
regrouped int he desert area near Freeport in East Commons, and chose to wait 
till nightfall to attack again...this got us killed...  Over the period of 9 
in game hours we waited, killed humans that would attempt to come nearby.  
Then the humans rallied against us.  First they sent low level scouts, and 
then when night fall came they attacked us!  It was an awesome battle, magic 
flying people running to find someone to kill.  Then the level 8-10's jumped 
in.  This time the Dark Elves only had level 6's and below.  We were 
slaughtered, but still there were no hard feelings.  It was all in good fun 
and it was for the sake of testing the Race War system.

Things you should know about the Race War (as it is now on the Test Server)

Races

Choosing your race is fairly important on the Race War server, not because 
you want to chose the most powerful one, but because you want to be able to 
defend yourself in a solo Vs group fight.

I know many people chose to be a Human because they are accepted by most 
races.  Not so on the RW server.  The NPC's won't attack you if you are 
human, but no one will let you into their city long enough to buy items or 
sell things if you are not part of their team.  No matter what you are loved 
by all on your team (only exception are the Erudite Necromancers who are 
KoS'd by humans and Barbarians).  This also changes the difficulty level's 
that show up when creating a character.  To a certain extent all races are 
equally difficult now.  Trolls won't be going to Qeynos to make muffins for 
Nerissa Clothspinner, nor will Humans be going to Kaladim to get the 
Bloodforge hammer.

Things you should know when choosing your class

Classes are different on the Race War server...some don't change, some change 
for the worse, and some change for the better...

First the monk class... I'm afraid the fact that as of right now only humans 
can be monks has devastated them.  Guk is the main source for Netted, and 
Mesh armor, and Guk is under the control of the evil race.  You can get it 
from other area's but it will be harder than it was in the past on other 
servers.

Now Enchanters...with their ability to take the form of other races is a 
great asset.  They can go more area's, get more items, and make hundreds upon 
hundreds of platinum selling items not native to that races land.  It is self 
only so no one else can come along for the ride with an enchanter.

Miscellaneous things to know
(These things will probably change soon, but as of July 10, 1999 it is how it 
is on the test server)

1.  Guards do not interfere with combat (at least not the Freeport Militia to 
Dark Elves)

2.  Level limit to attack someone is -8+, but this brings up the problem of a 
level 30 trying to defend an invasion of newbies...

3.  No Exp loss or gain for killing someone

4.  Estimated that 3000+ people will be on the Race War server...might want 
to wait for a second Race War server if you aren't use to HUGE insane lag!

5.  Teams for combat are as follows: Humans, Barbarians, Erudites Vs Dark 
Elves, Ogres, Trolls Vs Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes Vs Wood Elves, High Elves, 
and Half Elves.

6.  Half Elves that start in Qeynos or Freeport will be killed by other 
players.

7.  The Races that have the most battles are Humans Vs Dark Elves, Dwarves 
and Gnomes (mostly Gnomes) Vs Elves.

I hope this helps answer some questions for some of you about the Race War 
Server.  The world of Race War is different from a regular server, more so 
than just the PvP aspect of it.

See you all on Tallon Zek!
