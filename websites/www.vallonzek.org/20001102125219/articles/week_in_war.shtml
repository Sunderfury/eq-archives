Hail all, this is FuzzBusta yet again, but instead of an editorial like last 
time, I will be bringing you a weekly update of the constant battles of the 
race war that goes on in Tallon Zek. I along with the other Norrathian 
Merchants will be watching the war from our point of view, and I am going to 
post up any results, held territories, zones and the such. However, since i 
cannot be everywhere everyday, I will need the constant update from my guild 
friends as well as the soldiers of the war. Though, I ask no propaganda mails 
be sent, as I will just disregard the email if it is. I only wish for a 
balanced coverage of the battle, the results and other pertinant information. 
Well, on to the report : 

Well, first off the battles between the Humans and the Dark Empire has been 
constant and non-stop. The Freeport West gate is lagged to hell because of 
the bodies everywhere ( forgive me, I go from OOC to regular speech, so 
forgive me all you EQ nuts ). The East Commonlands along with Northern Ro 
have been fought over constantly by the DE and Humans, with the territory 
changing hands so much it's hard to keep track. I played a Human Enchanter 
named Valluron, and a Human Monk named Falloron. I could hardly level because 
of the threat looming in the distance of the DE, and the fact that the newbie 
grounds were so damn crowded. Though, when all seemed just about lost, a few 
groups of reinforcements arrived to help us out. Eventually they took the 
East Commonlands back, and after that I am unsure of, as I went to the other 
warzone........

The other huge warzone is in Greater Faydark, which isnt as badly populated 
as I thought it would be. I managed to level up my High Elf Enchanter named 
Quillo very quickly, despite the newbie zones being crowded. I managed also 
to avoid battles with Gnomes and Dwarves, though I did almost die to one ( 
Snoopy, you know who you are ). I did however manage to avoid death a few 
times. After a bit, I met a dwarf hiding out in the jewel shop in Felwithe. I 
helped him escape, and in return along with his friendship, he taught me 
Dwarvish and Gnomish ( most of Gnomish anyways, still got to learn a bit :P 
). If you want, I will teach you if you find me, but I dont teach for free. 
As for battles, the main ones were small between 1 or 2 Gnomes and a few 
Elves, but there was one big battle for control of the Lower Faydark zone. A 
few groups of Elves versus many a Gnome fought, and eventually the Gnomes 
were pushed back. A few brave Elves decided to push them entirely out of 
Lower Fay, but as for their success I am unsure of because I was trying to 
keep my new Dwarven friend from getting killed by other Elves. 

As for any other battles, well I leave that up for you guys to tell me about. 
Oh and one more thing, if you see a member of the opposing races trying to 
help out, and their intentions are noble, let them help you out. It is always 
good to have spies on your side or have allies against a common enemy. After 
all, the US had a spy in the Kremlin for years, and it helped us win the Cold 
War. Why not let someone be that quintessential spy for your race? For those 
of you who say no because "This is race war and I am going to kill him no 
matter what", well he may have some friends from your own race that might 
take it to offense, and why the hell wouldn't you want a spy? Recon work is 
half the fun in a war. I mean, if you wanted to know where your enemy was, 
you would kill for a spy. 

Well for this week, my report is small and short, but next week I hope there 
will be some interesting battles to be had since everyone will be higher 
levels with more atmosphere and the such. Have fun, and remember, it's only a 
game.............
