</CENTER>

This zone is accessed from the middle of Dreadlands. It is a 45+ zone. Even in the high
50's you can get good exp in here at the right places.<P>

It is an indoor zone so wolform, SoW and harmony all work well here.<P>

This is a very rough incomplete guide. I wrote it initially for my guild after some trips
there and figured I might as well expand it into a semi-full guide. The guide and maps are
also intended to aid other monks in their quest for the Staff of Tranquility and the
Drolvarg Pawduster.<P>

If you want to tell me all the things wrong with the guide I can be
contacted at kith@iweb.net.au.

<H2>Mobs</H2>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Skeletons:</B> Skeletal Guardian, Skeletal Protector, Decayed Soldier, Decayed Prisoner
             Skeletal Lookout, Skeletal Watcher.<P>
  <LI><B>Drolvarg:</B> Drolvarg Sentry, Drolvarg Guardian, Drolvarg Bodyguard.<P>
  <LI><B>Spectral:</B> Spectral Curate, Spectral Caller, Spectral Protector, Spectral Knight.<P>
  <LI><B>Hands:</B> Cursed Hand, Construct.<P>
</UL>

All of the skeletons, drolvarg and hands are straight warrior type mobs. Spectral
Curates are clerics and Spectral Callers are shamans.<P>

There are two types of Drolvargs, big ones found around the zone/captain/warlord area
and small ones found in moat and main castle. I have been told small ones are undead.
Either way big ones always run and the small ones do not. Skeletons do not run but spectrals
and hands do.<P>

<H2>Named Mobs</H2>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Skeletal:</B> Skeletal Scryer, Skeletal Warlord, Skeletal Berserker, Skeletal Captain.<P>
  <LI><B>Spectral:</B> Caller of Sathir, Sentry of Sathir.<P>
  <LI><B>Drolvarg:</B> Drolvarg Captain, Drolvarg Warlord, Drolvarg Pawduster.<P>
  <LI><B>Misc:</B> Undead Jailor, Construct of Sathir, Venril Sathir.<P>
</UL>

The Scryer is a wizard and the other skeletons are warriors. The Caller of Sathir is a shaman
while the Sentry of Sathir is warrior. All Drolvarg are warrior types. The Construct of Sathir
is a shadowknight with a nasty harm touch. If you are fighting Venril good luck!<P>

<H2>Maps</H2>

I have drawn up some dodgy maps of the zone until someone does some better ones. And no,
adding some fancy textures to my maps and putting your name on it does not constitute a
better map ;-)<P>

The maps are not to scale and there are some small innacuracies I could not be
bothered fixing but if you cant find your way around with these a better map is not what
you need ;-)<P>

<H2>Tourist Stops</H2>

This section covers the major areas of the zone.<P>

<H3>1: Zone</H3>

The zone can accomodate two camp spots at the left (marked 1L) and right zone (marked 1R). They
are nice camp spots due to proximity of zone but bad due to proximity of zone (i.e. trains ;-)
Due to the dodgy aggro keep well back from the intersection while fighting or you may attract
pulls from the other zone group. If there is only one group at the zone the intersection is a
nice place to camp as the group can see incoming pulls but be prepared to move once another
group sets up at the zone.<P>

On some servers people have tried to set up one zoneline for incoming people/camping and the
other zone for outgoing people/trains. While this sounds great in theory I doubt it will
ever become common practice due to the current popularity of the zone.<P>

<H3>2: Moat Corners</H3>

From the zone move past the first two drolvarg spawns and turn left or right before crossing
the bridge. The far corners are known as the left (marked 2L) and right (marked 2R) moat corner
camps. They are good places to camp as they are out of the path of trains and less crowded than
the zone. Be aware when camping here that if you stand or fight near the moat edge you can aggro
mobs in the moat. This can be avoided by pulling to the appropriate place and placing the tanks
appropriately.<P>

I perfer the left moat corner. It provides a larger surface area which is useful if parking
becomes necessary. The right corner is much more cramped and has a "hole" in the path to it
requiring some acrobatics to negotiate it.<P>

From these camps you will have access to the numerous moat wanderers as well as normal pulling
from the castles.<P>

<H3>3: Captain Area</H3>

Across the first bridge is the Captain area, named for the Drolvarg Captain who occasionaly
spawns on the second level. It lies in the centre of the moat. A second bridge goes from the
captain area into the main castle. At the ground floor are four static drolvargs. Up the stairs
is the Captain area proper. This area contains six static drolvargs, four at the front and two
at the back. It also contains 4 wandering drolvargs. For pullers passing under this area
remember that one of the captain area wanderers walks right across the bottom area. The other
three always stay up top. Any of these 10 drolvargs can occasionaly spawn as the Drolvarg
Captain. The spawns on the front ramparts are paired and two will come if you aggro one
(Unless the puller is 54+, see Aggro Reduction below).<P>

Many people choose to camp the captain area from the small room at the top of the stairs.
This is not a good camp place due to the dodgy aggro of the mobs. If someone pulls some mobs
through the ground floor of the captain area there is a good chance these mobs may aggro on
your group at the top of the stairs. Also if the your puller is passing across the bridge on
the second level he will definately aggro on mobs being pulled underneath. If you still want
to camp up here I would recommend moving to the room directly opposite the stair room. Also
ensure your puller does not use the bridge.<P>

It is possible to pull the entire captain area (not all in one go hopefully) to a zone or moat
corner camp. This may be preferable to camping up there and suffering possible
trains. The only problem with doing this is that unless you are camped up there it seems to
be open season. As soon as the captain spawns you will find 4 pullers scrabbling to get it ;-)
A polite /shout to the zone saying you are pulling the captain area may either get people to
leave spawns up there for you or alert them to safe captain pulls when he pops ;-)<P>

<H3>4: Left Courtyard/Well Courtyard Area</H3>

If you run across both bridges you enter the main castle. Just over the second bridge is a T
intersection. Go left into the left courtyard. Immediately upon entering move to the middle of
the left wall. This seems to be the best place to camp in this courtyard. Other places seems to
pull trains down from the above walkways. If you are camping in this area a better place is the
well courtyard. From the above mentioned camp move through the arch opposite into a smaller
courtyard with a well in the middle. To the left is a spot with two spawns. This is the camp
spot. The well is slightly better as there are no wanderers pathing directly through your camp.<P>

<H3>5: Right Courtyard</H3>

While I have camped here once it does not seem like a great place to camp. Immediately upon
entering look to the left and you will see a statue. Have the group camp at this spot. Only
the puller should move from this spot. The reason is that this place is often camped for the
Undead Jailor. From the camp move over to the far right corner. Stand/sit in this corner and
you will aggro the Undead Jailor room below. This usually consists of two skeletons, a hand
and the Undead Jailor/placeholder. Also from this camp you can pull the 5 rooms through the
door on the left. I have not pulled these much but they contain quite a few mobs including a
spawn point for the Skeletal Scryer and Spectral Knight. It is possible these rooms would
provide a more secure camp spot than the courtyard but have not tried it myself. If you are
pulling these rooms do it carefully. On the ground floor you will aggro the mobs in the two
rooms above you.<P>

<H3>6: Council Chamber</H3>

In the center of the main castle is a large room as tall as three levels. Around the outer walls
of level 2 and 3 (marked 6b and 6c respectively) are ledges from which you can look down onto
floor of the chamber (marked 6a).<P>

In this area you can find Skeletal Protectors among other things. I have not explored all of the
small siderooms in this area.<P>

<H3>7: Venril Sethir</H3>

At the bottom far end of the council chamber are some passages leading to the chambers of
Venril Sethir. He is guarded by six mobs and is pretty rough, apparently slightly tougher
than phinegal from Kedge Keep. I have not fought him at all, nor approached this area.<P>

<H3>8: Skeletal Towers</H3>

From the left courtyard go up the stairs. You will come to a T intersection. Just to the right
is an open area with a single static skeleton spawn (Lookout/Watcher). This is the first
skeletal tower (Tower1, Marked 8). Go left and you will find three more skeletal towers (Tower2, Tower3
and Tower4). The first three towers have a single static skeleton spawn while Tower4 has a 
skeleton spawn and in the room below two more mobs that aggro as well (Usually a hand and
decayed skeleton). The walkways in this area contain quite a few wanderers (at least 4). If you
are camping this area I would recommend setting up camp on Tower2. While Tower1 can be camped
it has many more mobs wandering through and is not as secure as Tower2. The Skeletal Captain
spawns in this area although I have only ever seen him spawn on Tower4 and Tower3.<P>

When fighting in this area make sure you do not push the mobs of the edge. They usually return
with a few more mobs. Also dont fall of the edge yourself which could be embarrasing ;-)<P>

<H3>9: Hand</H3>

From Tower2 head towards Tower1 and keep going straight on. You will pass a door on the right,
ignore this. You will pass a passage on the right, ignore this. Eventually the path turns right.
Just on your left is a short door. You can look over the door (unless you are a shorty) into
the Hand room. This room contains 4 spawns, typically cursed hands or constructs. Rarely the
Construct of Sethir will spawn in this room. Once the room is broken it makes a nice camp spot
as it is reasonably large and out of the path of wanderers.<P>

Note that you do not aggro the hand room from the corridor outside. You can even pull mobs past
the hand room without aggroing them. This is nice if you want to pull the jail/warlord areas
without having to worry about the hand room.<P>

<H3>10: Jail</H3>

Instead of entering the hand room pass it with the door on your left. You will reach a T
intersection. Go left then right. To your right you will see an archway. Look in there and you
will see 5 doors. Each is the door to a cell and there are 4 aggro mobs in here. The second door
to the right contains the Human Skeleton. It cons indifferent to most/all people and is part of
a wizard quest.<P>

Be careful of the aggro in this area. You will aggro at least 2 jail mobs through the walls as
you reach the T intersection described above. After that move slowly towards the jail and you
will be able to aggro the remaining two mobs seperately if desired.<P>

Rarely in one of the jail cells will spawn a Skeletal Warlord.<P>

<H3>11: Drolvarg Warlord</H3>

From the jail move past the five doors to a set of stairs at the end. Go down the stairs and open
the door. Inside is a small room containing 4 spawn points. This is the Drolvarg Warlord room.
Typically it will contain Drolvarg Bodyguards. Any of these spawns can occasionaly be a Drolvarg
Warlord. Like frenzied ghouls it is possible to have multiple Warlords spawned at once. Also in
this room can spawn a Wulfewere Bodyguard and a Drolvarg Pawduster. All these mobs (except maybe
the Pawduster) are 50+ with the Warlord being 53 or so.<P>

If your goal is to camp this area there are two possible ways to break it. A monk can FD split
the area fairly easily. Set up camp at Tower2/Tower1 and have the monk clear the jail. The monk
will then aggro the Warlord room and run up and feign near the door to the hand. They can be chain
pulled in the normal fashion. Be aware of the teleportation pathing described below. This will
happen here. The monk will aggro the room and run just past the hand room. Stand there until one
or more of the mobs teleports on top of you before feigning. Once the room is broken you can move
into the room and camp there. I have not camped in the room, only pulled it to the skeletal towers
so do not know of any problems with camping in there but it should be fine.<P>

If you have no monk you will just have to rush the room. I have heard that six people level 48-52
can rush the room and survive. It will be a very tough fight though.<P>


<H3>Basement</H3>

There are at least three ways to get into the basement.<P>

<OL>
  <LI><B>Moat Tunnel:</B> Stand at the right zone and follow the right wall until you come to the
   back wall of the zone. Left is a narrow channel of the moat which seperates you from the main castle.
   In the moat is an underwater tunnel which leads into the basement. The moat wanderers come from here
   and do laps of the moat.<P>
  <LI><B>Well:</B> Leap into the well for a quick way into the basement.<P>
  <LI><B>Upper Stairs:</B> From Tower1 head towards the hand room. You will pass a door on your right, then
   a passage on your right. Look down the passage and you will see stairs going down. These
   stairs take you down into the basement.<P>
</OL>

I have not been far into the basement and cannot make any comments on possible camp places or
mobs you will encounter. Going down the stairs is probably the best method for gaining access.<P>

I will draw up a map of this area when I have explored it a bit more.<P>

<H3>Skeletal Warlord</H3>

Not an actual area but some pointers on camping the Skeletal Warlord.<P>

The Skeletal Warlord spawns in at least three places which makes him hard to camp. The places
I have seen him are:<P>

<OL>
  <LI><B>Bridge 2:</B> Crossing the second bridge you will find 2 spawn points just before the T
             intersection. Either of these spawn points can rarely be the Skeletal Warlord.<P>
  <LI><B>Well Courtyard:</B> As you enter this courtyard you will see two doors to your right and
             a third door opposite. Go in the second righthand door to a small room. To
             the left is another door to another room. Directly left of the door is a spawn
             point that can rarely be the Skeletal Warlord.<P>
             The door opposite the entry arch contains a small room with two spawn points. These
             can also spawn as a Skeletal Warlord.<P>
  <LI><B>Jail:</B> One of the 4 mobs in the jail can rarely be a Skeletal Warlord.<P>
</OL>

The Well Courtyard is probably the best place to camp if you are specifically after the Skeletal
Warlord. From here you can pull the seven mobs from the well rooms. Then you can go through
those rooms, up the stairs and pull the jail area. You can potentially get the bridge warlord
but that is usually pulled fairly quickly by the zone groups which makes it hard to camp.<P>

It is possible that the Skeletal Warlord can spawn in any point where a skeleton can spawn. I have
never seen him in any place other than those mentioned above, and have seen him many times in each
of the above places.<P>

<H2>Misc Issues</H2>

Random, potentially useful things to know about the zone.<P>

<H3>Bridge Aggro</H3>

If you stand on one of the two bridges you will eventually aggro a mob swimming in the moat
below you. This is often the cause of unexpected trains as you run deep into the castle,
unknowingly aggroing a moat mob, pull something and aggro another moat mob on the way back.
You can either be aware of the problem and look before you cross the bridge or just think
about all the extra exp you will get ;-)<P>

<H3>Pathing</H3>

The pathing is slightly dodgy in a few places. If you aggro a moat mob on the second bridge it
will swim all the way to the right moat corner, get on land and run across the first bridge after
you. Pulling mobs from the moat can sometimes cause problems because of the paths they take to
get out of the moat. If you pull a mob from in the main castle and run through captain area the
mob will come after you to the first bridge. It then does a little backtrack towards the second
bridge before turning back to come after you again. Dont be fooled and run after it when it turns
back ;-)<P>

<H3>Teleportation Pathing</H3>

In some places the mobs just cant be bothered walking. If you get too far from them they may
get lazy and teleport to your location. There are at least two places where this will happen:<P>

1) Drolvarg Captain Area: This can be used to your advantage. Run up into the captain area, grab
   a mob and leap of either the second level bridge or the ramparts. Run across the bridge and
   stand on the other side. The mob will eventually teleport to you. This is nice as it avoids
   the chance of the mob aggroing the moat as it passes across the bridge. It can cause problems
   if there are a lot of mobs up top and they get aggroed in the process.<P>

2) Warlord Area: If you pull the warlord area you can lose them through the jail. Wait just past
   the hand room and eventually some will teleport to you. If you are lucky just one of the mobs
   will teleport to your location making for an easy chain pull.<P>

<H3>Proximity Aggro</H3>

The mobs are lazy. If they chase a puller past another player they will stop running after the
original puller to beat on the newcomer who is much closer to them. Please be aware of this
problem if you are the puller. If some one is pulling out of the castle move out of the way
till they have passed or you will get trained. If you are pulling keep an eye on your pull. If
it stops following go after it and reaggro. Monks make great pullers here as they can FD out of
the way of another persons pull rather then having to possibly retreat all the way out.<P>

<H3>Lazy Hate List:</H3>

Like the rest of Kunark if you aggro a monster and move a certain distance from it it decides
you are not worth the effort and stops chasing you. You are NOT removed from the hate list. If you
then move back inside the "Hey, that guy is back and I am gonna kill him" radius it will reaggro
probably bringing a huge train. While this feature can sometimes be used to escape a nasty pull
make sure you know when you are still aggroed. Rezone if so or bad things may happen.<P>

<H3>Named Mobs:</H3>

There are several named mobs that spawn in random locations. Sentry of Sethir and Caller of
Sethir both can spawn as wanderers over the second bridge, usually in the left/right courtyards.
Skeletal Scryers are usually found in the moat but there is also one in the rooms of the right
courtyard. Skeletal Berserkers also spawn in the main castle courtyards. The only place I
recall seeing Beserkers spawn is in the two spawn point in the Well Courtyard.<P>

<H3>Aggro Reduction:</H3>

As a character gains levels aggro radius of mobs reduces greatly. In Karnors the magic level
seems to be 54. At level 54 I can aggro once of the two entrance spawns and the second spawn will
not chain aggro. I can even pull mobs past a single entrance spawn without aggroing it. This works
for all Drolvarg sentries at least. This makes pulling much easier, especialy if you are pulling
deeper as you can just ignore some of the earlier mobs.<P>

<H2>Loot:</H2>

Random mobs can drop Singing Steel Boots and Singing Steel Gauntlets. Cobolt can drop but not
sure of what.<P>
