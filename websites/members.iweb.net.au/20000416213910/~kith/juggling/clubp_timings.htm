<H2>Club Passing - Timings</H2>

People seem to refer to both the physical location of passers and the timing of the passes as the Passing Pattern. For example 3-count is
a passing pattern and a 4 person line feed is a passing pattern. This is confusing so I refer to the timing or count of the pattern as the
<b>Passing Timing</b> and the physical location of passers and who they pass to in what order as the <b>Passing Pattern</b>.

Only passing with two people is described in this section.<p>

<H3>N-Count Patterns</H3>

There are many names for the different passing timings. I prefer the n-count notation and use it throughout these pages. I have also included
some of the more common names for these timings.<P>

Probably the most common timing for two person passing, and one that most people learn before any
other, is 4-count. It is also referred to as "every others".<P>

<H4>4-count</H4>

In general an n-count timing means that during a regular 3 club cascade every n'th throw is a pass to the other person. Thus for a right handed
4-count every 4th throw, or every 2nd right hand throw is a pass straight across to the other passer. 6-count, 8-count etc, are just slower
versions of the 4-count pattern and good variations to try when first learning to pass.<P>

The standard 4-count (both passers do the same thing) can be represented in the following table:<P>

<TABLE BORDER=3>
  <TR>
    <TD><B>4-count</B></TD>
    <TD>RP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td>
    <TD>RP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

Obviously you can do a left handed 4-count by passing with the left hand on every 4'th beat.<P>

<H4>2-count</H4>

2-count (Also called "solids" or "everies") is the fast version of this timing. It involves passing every time with the right hand.<P>

<H4>3-count</H4>

If n is an odd number it means that you must pass with both hands. For example 3-count (Also called "left-right", "alternates","waltz" or "rejects")
involves performing a right handed pass followed by two self throws followed by a left handed pass followed by two more self throws. It then
repeats. Again 5-count, 7-count etc are slower versions of 3-count.<P>

3-count (both passers do the same thing) is represented in the following table:<P>

<TABLE BORDER=3>
<TR>
  <td><b>3-count</b></td>
  <td>RP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>LP</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td>
  <td>RP</td>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

When learning 3-count first try a left handed 6-count or 4-count. Then you can try 5-count and finally 3-count. It is useful to note that in 3-count
the same clubs should continually be passed back and forth. Thus you can concentrate on just throwing back the club your partner has
just thrown to you.<P>

<H4>1-count</H4>

The last n-count timing is 1-count (Also called "ultimates", "solids" or "thundershower"). For this timing all throws are passes. Thus you
continually perform a right handed pass followed by a left handed pass. This is represented in the following table:<P>

<table border=3>
<TR>
  <td>1-count</td>
  <td>RP</td><td>LP</td><td>RP</td><td>LP</td><td>RP</td>
  <td>LP</td><td>RP</td>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

<H4>M/N-count</H4>

An n-count timing can be thought of as doing 1 pass for every n throws. This can be extended to timings in which you perform m
passes for every n throws. This leads to some interesting patterns such as 2/3-count (Or "pass pass self") which is represented in
the following table:<P>

<TABLE BORDER=3>
  <TR>
      <td>RP</td><td>LP</td><td>rs</td><td>LP</td><td>RP</td>
      <td>ls</td>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

Other examples include 3/4-count (pass pass pass self), 2/4-count (pass pass self self) etc.<P>

I find these patterns (2/3-count and 3/4-count especially) good practice for 1-count.<P>

The m/n-count notation is not really sufficient because it assumes you perform m passes followed by n-m selfs. It does not describe the order
of the passes and selfs. Another type of notation that can be used (I may ditch the m/n-count notation) is the "PS" notation which simply lists the
order in which you perform passes (P) and selfs (S). Thus 2/3-count is PPS, 4-count is PSSS and 3-count is PSS. With this notation you can
describe timings such as PSPSP (2-count which changes directions), PSSPS, etc.<P>

The rest of this section describes variations of these passing timings.<P>

<h3>4-count Tricks</h3>

<p>

Another variations on the 4-count patterns involves one person passing normally, The other person passes from left hand staggering
throw so as not to hit incoming passes. Can throw double from right hand in normal left hand double timing but it goes straight across.
This is represented in the folllowing table:<p>

<p>

In the Double Pattern there are two ways in which the passers can change jobs (ie slow end
becomes fast end or vice versa)

<ul>
  <li>slow end steals fast end with a self
  <li>fast end pushes fast end with two consecutive doubles
</ul>
<P>

<A NAME="Jims3Count"></A>
<h4>Jims 3-count</h4>

In this 3-count variation one passer throws crossing passes with both hands while the other
throws straight passes. The rhythm is right right left left.<p>

<table border=3>
<tr>
  <td><b>A</b></td>  <TD>RxP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>LxP</td><td>lsh</td><td>rs</td>
                                  <td>LxP</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td><td>RxP</td><td>rsh</td><td>ls</td><td>...</td>

</TR>
</TABLE>

This pattern is named after Jim Brennan.<P>

<H4>Random 3-count</H4>

Similiar to Jims 3-count. Just throw your passes to a random hand of your partner. You will soon discover that there are various combinations
of passes that are collision prone. This leads to:<P>

<H4>All Collisions</H4>

Perform a Jims 3-count type timing where all of the passes are collision prone. With practice you can work out to (just) avoind the collisions.<P>

<HR WIDTH="95%" ALIGN=CENTER>

<H3>2-count (solids/PS)</H3>

Throw right-to-left triple without a double to set it up.<p>

<h4>Shower Thing</h4>

One person passes normal 2-count. The other person showers (left hand passes off clubs
rather than normal throw) while passing right to left doubles (or singles).<p>

<HR WIDTH="95%" ALIGN=CENTER>

<h3>1-count (ultimates/PPPP)</h3>

For 53 and 534 receiver must pause.

<H4>Jim's 1-count</H4>

This is a one count version of Jim's 3-count. One person passes straight passes, while the other person throws crossing passes.<P>

<h3>2/3 count</h3>

You can do the siteswap 441 in a 2/3 count timing by making each pass a double and each self a hand off. this is shown in

<h3>Seven</h3>

<h4>2-count Doubles</h4>

Both passers do doubles, passing out of phase. The person with four clubs starts the pattern (A in the following example) and the other person
starts half a beat later.<p>

<table border=1>
<tr>
  <td><b>A</b></td>
  <td>R2</td><td>ls</td><td>R2</td><td>ls</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table border=1>
<tr>
  <td width=25><b>B</b></td>
  <td>R2</td><td>ls</td><td>R2</td><td>ls</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>2-count Singles</h4>

Both passers do singles passes instead of doubles.<p>

<h4>4-count Triples (4-count)</h4>

This pattern was invented by Martin Frost.<P>

Pass every second right hand club as a triple. To start, the person with four clubs (two in each hand) throws a triple pass.  At the exact same
starting moment, the other person throws a self.  After that simultaneous start, each person simply alternates between triple passes and
right-hand selves.<p>

<table border=3>
<tr>
  <td><b>A</b></td>
  <td>R3</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td><td>R3</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>B</b></td>
  <td>rs</td><td>ls</td><td>R3</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td><td>R3</td><td>ls</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h5>Triples/singles</h5>

This pattern was invented by Martin Frost.<P>

One passer does triples and the other does singles. Each passer throws in phase (passes at the same time,starting on the second pass).<p>

<table border=3>
<tr>
  <td><b>A</b></td>  <td>R3</td><td>ls</td><td>R3</td><td>ls</td>

<H5>Odd-Godz</H5>

Person B passes every throw straight across. Person A passes every throw diagonally across. Passer A starts with 3 clubs in the right hand
and 1 in the left and passes with the rhythm right, right, left, left. <p>

<h5>3-count</h5>

Yet another Martin Frost pattern.<P>

A throws diagonal doubles, B throws straight doubles.<P>

</tr>
</TABLE>
<P>

When starting the person with four clubs passes to partners hand that has 2 clubs, and the second person (three clubs) does a self 1/2 count
later followed by a pass to the first hand that passed.<P>

<HR WIDTH="95%" ALIGN=CENTER>

<H3>Combinations</H3>

Various timings can be strung together into new patterns for extra fun. The most common of these patterns is known as 3-3-10. In this pattern
you perform 3 iterations of 6-count followed by 3 iterations of 4-count followed by 10 iterations of 2-count.<P>

There are many other (infinite) combinations that can be created.<P>

Another nice combination pattern involves performing the following sequence of timings: 2-count/3-count/4-count/3-count.<BR>
Only one iteration of each timing is performed. Because this involves passing to only one of your partners hands (because the 4-count starts
with a crossing throw) it is then repeated with passes going to the partners other hand. The final result is shown in the following table:<P>

<TABLE BORDER=3>
  <TR>
    <TD>RP</TD><TD>ls</TD><TD>RP</TD><TD>ls</TD><TD>rs</TD><TD>LxP</TD><TD>lsh</TD><TD>rs</TD><TD>ls</TD>

    <TD>LP</TD><TD>rs</TD><TD>ls</TD><TD>...</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

This pattern is interesting because of the repeated increase and decrease in passing frequency.<P>

It was created and posted to rec.juggling by Jim ???.<P>

<HR WIDTH="95%" ALIGN=CENTER>

<H3>Patterns From Hell</H3>

These patterns involve throwing doubles throws (whether they are passes or selfs) on a certain beat of a n-count pattern. The following table
shows an example of a 4-count timing with doubles every fifth beat.<P>

<table border=3>
<tr>
  <td>R2</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td>
  <td>RP</td><td>ls2</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td>
  <td>RP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs2</td><td>ls</td>
  <td>RP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>ls2</td>
  <td>RP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td>
</tr>
</table>
<P>

These patterns can be extended to n-count with doubles every m beats. For example 3-count, doubles every 5 or 2-count, doubles every 3.<p>

These patterns were created by Sean Gandini and Kati Yla-Hokkala.<P>

<HR WIDTH="95%" ALIGN=CENTER>

<H3>Fast-Slow or Slow-Fast</H3>

These patterns involve one person doing an m-count timing (where m is odd) and the other person doing an (m-1)-count timing. The person doing
the even count pattern must juggle slower than the other passer, and must alternate between throwing to the partners left and right hand. The
person doing the odd count passes faster and all passes go to the same hand.<P>

Typical examples include 1-count/2-count, 2-count/3-count and 4-count/5-count.<P>

<H4>RRLL (Right Right Left Left)</H4>

These are variations on the Fast-Slow pattern. One person performs a 2-count with passes going to alternating hands (I'll assume each person
has three clubs, two in the right hand and one in the left. The 2-count person starts with w fast start to the other persons right hand). The other
person performs RP rs LP ls. the following table shows this:<P>

<TABLE BORDER=3>
  <TR>
    <TD><B>2-count person</B></TD>  <TD>RxP</TD><TD>ls</TD><TD>RP</TD><TD>ls</TD><TD>...</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><B>RRLL person</B></TD>     <TD>RP</TD><TD>rs</TD><TD>LxP</TD><TD>ls</TD><TD>...</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

This pattern has been credited to Dave Morten, Rick Koshi and Erin Hellner. I am not sure about the
other variations.<P>

You can also do a 3-count variation of this. Now one person passes 3-count as normal while the other
person performs RxP rs LxP ls.<P>

3-count/1-count can also be done. From the above pattern the RRLL person starts performing normal
1-count, as slow as possible. The 3-count person should now be doing a VERY fast 3-count.<P>
