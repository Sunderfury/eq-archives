<H2>Introduction</H2>

Coin manipulation is the manipulation of coins or coin shaped objects with the
fingers. This page contains a list of all coin manipulation tricks that I know
of ranging from simple tricks that can be learnt in minutes such as the
<A HREF="#CoinSpin">Coin Spin</a> or the <A HREF="#OneFingerSpin">One Finger
Spin</A> to more complex tricks such as the <A HREF="#CoinWalk">Coin Walk</A>
or the <A HREF="#RollDownCoinFlourish">Roll Down Coin Flourish</A> that take
months to perfect.<P>

There is a strong link between coin manipulation and coin magic. I would
recommend looking at a good book on coin magic as this is the origin of some
of the tricks described here. I only have one (The New Modern Coin Magic,
J.B. Bobo) but you should be able to find more references on the web. Bobo
contains descriptions of the <A HREF="#CoinWalk">Coin Walk</A>,
the <A HREF="#RollDownCoinFlourish">Roll Down Coin Flourish</A> and the
<A HREF="#DownsStar"> Downs Star</A> among others.<P>

<A NAME="Coins"></A>
<H3>Coins</H3>

I mainly use Australian twenty cent pieces which are round and 2.8 cm in
diameter. Other coins I use include US half dollars which are 3.0 cm in
diameter and New Zealand fifty cent pieces which are 3.1 cm in diameter.
Different tricks will work better with different sized coins. The size of your
hands and fingers will also determine the best size of coin to use. Experiment
with different coins to work out which ones work best for you.<P>

Those tricks which involve gripping the coin by the edges will benefit from a
coin that has a rough milled edge.<P>

Also, if you are performing these tricks, a large shiny coin will produce
better results, as it will stand out against the hand better.<P>

<A NAME="BalanceToss"></A>

<H2>Balance Toss
<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 3, "../.." );</SCRIPT></H2>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
These tricks involve balancing coins on the fingertips and tossing them from
finger to finger.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Hold the hand out, palm up and balance a coin flatwise on the tip of finger 1.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Toss the coin up a short distance and catch it on finger 2. With practice you
can quickly move the coin from finger 1 to finger 4 and back.<P>

Difficulty can be increased by increasing the angle between the finger and
coin. Currently I do it with the coin parallel to the finger but can do some
tricks with the coin at a 90 degree angle to the finger (i.e. balanced on the
very tip of the finger rather than the pad).

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Variations</B><TD>
<UL>
  <LI> Place a second coin on finger 2 and toss both coin across to the next
       fingers.
  <LI> Place a 2 coin stack on finger 1 and toss them to the next finger.
  <LI> Place a 2 coin stack on finger 1. Toss the stack up with a slight
       sideways motion so that they seperate in the air. Catch one coin on
       finger 2 and the other on finger 3.
  <LI> Make a coin flip 180 degrees during the toss.
  <LI> Three coins at once.
  <LI> Two coins on seperate fingers to a stack on one finger.
</UL>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
I prefer larger heavier coins for these tricks as it makes the balance
easier.

<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 2, "../.." );</SCRIPT></H2>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This move is a variation of the <EM>One-Hand Switch</EM>, a move which is used
in coin magic. There are many other variations of this move described in <B>
Bobo</B>, which can be performed as pure manipulation tricks.<P>

The move requires the use of the <B>Classic Palm</B>, a coin palming technique
in which a coin is held in the centre of the palm so that the rest of the hand
can be moved freely. See <B>Bobo</B>, or another coin magic book, for more
details on palming techniques.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Position the hand as if it was relaxing by your side. The palm should be
perpendicular to the ground and the fingers slightly curled and parallel to
the ground. Coin 1 should be held in the <B>Classic Palm</B> position and coin
2 resting on fingers 3 and 4.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI> Pull down on the edge of coin 2 so that the coin flips over to the top
       of finger 2. This move is related to the <A HREF="#UndersideWalk">

  <LI> Release coin 1 and let it fall down until it rests on fingers 3 and 4.
       As it falls down it will flip 360 degrees.
  <LI> Coin 2 is now pushed up into the <B>Classic Palm</B> position with the
       tip of finger 2.

<A NAME="ClawCatch"></A>
<H2>Claw Catch
<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 3, "../.." );</SCRIPT></H2>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This trick involves throwing up several coins and catching them with multiple
claw catches.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Place two coins on the back of the hand.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Throw them in the air and catch each coin individually with a claw catch (i.e.
two separate catches).<P>

Now try more coins or coins on both hands at the same time. I can catch six
coins (3 on each hand) and four with one hand. It seems possible to do five
coins.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
You can make the last catch a bit easier by doing a palm up catch. With this
method I can do four coins consistently.<P>

To make the trick more impressive (difficult), limit the amount of upwards
distance to the throw, and the amount of distance below the initial throw
point for the last catch. As an example, with three coins I throw them up about
10cm, and the last catch is about 10cm below the initial throw point.<P>

<B>Flatwise</B>:<BR>
A more difficult version is to catch each coin flatwise. The first coin is
caught between the thumb and finger 1, the second is caught between the back
of finger 1 and finger 2, and so on. The trick can be made easier by reducing
the amount of spin on the coins when they are thrown. I can do this with 1
coin consistently, two coins occasionaly and once (probably never again) with
three coins.<P>

<B>Edgewise</B>:<BR>
If the flatwise version wasn't hard enough try to make each catch edgewise
between pairs of fingers. This is extremely hard and I can do it with 1 coin
about 1 time in 50.

<A NAME="CoinSpin"></A>
<H2>Coin Spin
<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 1, "../.." );</SCRIPT></H2>

The Spin is a fundamental move that forms the basis for many tricks. It
involves spinning a object between the thumb and the first two fingers and can
be performed with coins, pencils, cards and other objects.<P>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Coin Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
The basic move involves spinning a coin (or other object) between the thumb
and the first two fingers.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Hold a coin flatwise between the thumb and finger 1. The thumb is on top and
heads is facing the thumb.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI> Push the coin with the thumb over the tip of finger 1 until the coin is
       being held with the thumb and the back of finger 1 (on the nail).<BR>
       Replace the thumb with finger 2. Now the coin is held between finger 2
       and the back of finger 1 with heads facing finger 2.
  <LI> Replace finger 1 with the thumb.
  <LI> Replace finger 2 with finger 1. You are now back to the starting
       position but tails are now facing the thumb.
  <LI> Repeat.
</OL>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
With practice you should be able to do this spin very quickly and smoothly.
When you get it working correctly, finger 2 stays still while the other two do
most of the work.<P>

This is spinning forwards. You can also do the spin to the right, left and
backwards (backwards is the hardest for me).<P>

Once you can do this trick smoothly practice it using fingers 2 and 3, and
fingers 3 and 4. At first this will seem awkward but these variations are
essential for some of the other tricks described later.

reduced.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Stack Spin
<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 2, "../.." );</SCRIPT></CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This trick involves performing a <A HREF="#CoinSpin">Coin Spin</A> with a
stack of two or more coins.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Start with a stack of two or more coins held flatwise between the thumb and
finger 1.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Perform a normal <A HREF="#CoinSpin">Coin Spin</A> but treat the stack as if
it was just one coin. The coins will slide against each other during the
motion but this can be reduced with practice.<P>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Variations</B><TD>
During a 2 coin stack spin you can make the coins flip around each other.
There are three variations described.<BR>

<UL>
  <LI> <B>Top Coin Flip</B>: Perform steps 1 and 2 of the <A HREF="#CoinSpin">
       Coin Spin</A>. Slide the top coin away from you with the thumb until
       only half of it is resting on the bottom coin. Use finger 1 to flip the
       top coin 180 degrees until it is resting on top of the thumb. Remove
       the thumb.
  <LI> <B>Exchange</B>: Perform step 1 of the <A HREF="#CoinSpin">Coin
       Spin</A>. Slide the top coin sway from you with finger 1 until
       only half of it is resting on the bottom coin. Hold the bottom
       coin with the thumb, then slide the top coin back further, then
       under the bottom coin (keeping the same face to the top). You will
       finish at step 2 of the <A HREF="#CoinSpin">Coin Spin</A>.
  <LI> <B>Bottom Coin Flip</B>: Perform step 1 of the <A HREF="#CoinSpin">Coin
       Spin</A>. Slide the top coin away, as in the above variation. Move the
       thumb underneath the bottom coin and flip it 180 degrees upwards until
       it is resting on top of finger 1. Remove finger 1 and finish at step 2
       of the <A HREF="#CoinSpin">Coin Spin</A>.
</UL>

If you understand those descriptions then with practice you can do a fast two
<A HREF="#CoinSpin">Coin Spin</A> throwing in the above three moves when you
feel like it.

<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 2, "../.." );</SCRIPT></CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
The base trick involves making a coin walk across the back of the knuckles,
from finger 1 to finger 4.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
The hand position for all <A HREF="#CoinWalk">Coin Walk</A> tricks is with
the palm down, fingers curled into a loose fist with the first joint of the
fingers parallel to the ground. Only the first joint of the fingers are used.

Start with a coin held between the tip of the thumb and side of finger 1.
Heads facing the thumb.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI> With the thumb, push the coin slightly until it is balancing on the top
       of finger 1.
  <LI> Use the inside of finger 2 to grab the edge of the coin and pull down
       on it so that the coin rolls over to the top of finger 2. Tails is now

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
One of the problems when first learning this trick is that the coin tends to
slip off the knuckles. This can be helped by licking the back of the knuckles
which will help to prevent the coin sliding.

A nice variation of this is to continually move the coin around finger 1.
Perform steps 1 and 2 above. Now grab the coin (under the hand) with the thumb
and finger 2. replace finger 2 with finger 1 to return to the start.<P>

Start with a stack of 4 coins resting on the palm (on the fleshy part at

This trick is based on a magic effect but I will only describe the required

The move involves tipping a coin from one palm to another as if you are going

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B><TD>
Start with the right hand outstretched, palm up and fingers pointing away from

Hold the hand out so that finger 1 is parallel to the ground and the palm is

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
For the best effect try to minimize the amount of coin that you grab with the

You can increase the amount of coins but there is a limit. I can create a nice
fan with up to 8 50c pieces. Any more than that and I end up with the bottom

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Start as for <A HREF="#Method 1">Method 1</A>. Make sure that all of the
fingers are held together with the tips level. This provides a base along which
the coins can be fanned.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Bend the thumb over to the far side of the stack and slide the thumb backwards
so that the entire stack moves a half diameter. Continue this until the coins
are fanned across the finger tips. The bottom coin will be over finger 1 and
the top coin over finger 4.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
The disadvantage to this method is that it is harder to get a neat fan. Also,
IMO, the completed fan does not look as nice as the previous version.<BR>
The advantage is that more coins can be fanned, and that after completing the
fan you can remove the thumb to show the fanned coins resting on the
fingertips.<P>

This method is a good way to get to the <A HREF="#DownsStar">Downs Star</A>.
Perform the Fan with four coins and make sure that the trick finishes with each
coin centered over a fingertip. Then seperate the fingers to complete the star.

This trick involves holding a stack of two coins between two fingers of either
hand then alternating flipping the coins.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Start with a stack of two coins held edgewise between the thumb and finger 1
of the right hand. The thumb should be above finger 1 with the fingers pointing
to the left. Now grab the stack with the thumb and finger 1 of the left hand in
a similiar manner with the thumb close to you and finger 1 on the far side of
the stack.

This is a trick I used to do as a kid and have recently seen in the movie

<A NAME="ForcedCoinToss"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Forced Coin Toss
<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 2, "../.." );</SCRIPT></CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This is a method in which you can force the result of a coin toss. By coin toss
I mean the move where you toss a spinning coin in the air, catch it in the
hand, slap it on the back of the other hand and someone calls heads or tails.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Use a coin that has a rough pattern on one side and a smooth one on the other.
You need to be able to distinguish between each side by feeling it quickly with
the tip of the thumb.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Toss it in the air, catch it with your right hand with the tips of fingers 1,
2 and 3 with the tip of your thumb touching the face of the coin. Quickly
determine which face is upwards by moving the thumb across the face. Now you
can either predict the outcome of the toss, or force the desired result by
using the <A HREF="#FaceChanging">Face Changing</A> move during the slapping
motion if necessary.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
The whole motion should be practiced until it can be done smoothly so that
there is no discernable difference between a forced toss and a normal toss.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Magnetic Coin Balance</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This trick involves balancing a coin edgewise on another through the use of a
small magnet.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Find two coins that are made of the right metals, so that they
are attracted by the magnet. Hide a small magnet between the thumb and the
first two fingers.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Hold one coin (preferably one that is slightly larger than the one to be
balanced) between these fingers as well. Place the second coin in an edgewise
balance on top of the first coin and the magnet should cause it to remain
balanced there. If you are careful you can even set the top coin spinning!

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Place two small coins next to each other so their edges touch. Now place a
match across the whole length and grab the ends of the match and coins with
finger 1 and the thumb. With the match hidden behind the coins it will look
like you are balancing the coins on each other.

</H3><SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 1, "../.." );</SCRIPT></CENTER>

Certain coins are wide enough that they can be balanced edgewise on a
reasonably flat surface without any skill needed. Apparently a US nickel is a
good coin for this. Assuming you are already adept at balancing things on your
nose (juggling clubs, pencils, etc) it should be an easy matter to balance a
coin on your nose.<P>

There are probably people skilled enough at balancing to do this with any old
coin.<P>

<H2>Monocle Catch
<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 3, "../.." );</SCRIPT></H2>

This trick was made famous by M. Cinquevalli and others in the late 1800's. A
description of it can be found
<A HREF="http://www.juggling.org/bin/mfs/JIS/books/ingalese/chap7.html">
here</A> under the title <B>The Eyeglass Trick</B>. Essentially a coin is
dropped to be caught on the foot, then kicked up into the air to be caught in
the eye as if it were a monocle or eyeglass.<P>

I have not seen it performed but I can throw a coin from the hand to the same
catch (Which is much easier :-). Actually I don't use a real coin but a light
plastic casino chip. I have tried the kickup version but it's pretty hard ;-)

EXPAND THIS!!!<P>

This trick involves placing a coin on the palm, squeezing with the muscles of
the hand and making the coin jump up into the air, all without any apparent
motion of the hand. It is a move used in coin magic which looks very impressive
when performed well.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Place a coin in a high <B>Classic Palm</B> position (closer to the thumb than
normal).

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Now slowly squeeze with the big muscle of the thumb to apply pressure to the
edges of the coin. When done right the coin should fly up and to the left
(assuming the right hand is used).

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
This is VERY hard. It will take a lot of conditioning of the hand muscles until
you can even get the coin to flip over. But with practice you can get the coin
to jump upwards at least 30cm.

This trick involves bouncing a small coin between two larger coins.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Place two large coins about 10cm apart on a flat smooth surface. Place a
smaller coin next to one of the large coins and place an index finger of each
hand on top of the large coins.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Sharply hit the small coin with one of the larger coins so that it slides
across towards the other coin. Before it stops sliding hit it back towards
the start. Repeat.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
Try to increase the speed of the small coin and the distance it moves. At first
you will need to make a lot of error corrections as the small coin bounces of
at weired angles but this can be reduced with practice.<P>

I am currently experimenting with a variation in which two small coins are
bounced back and forth in two columns as follows:<P>

<PRE>
      C1 <- c1     ->      c1,c2 Two small coins
         <-     c2 -> C2   C1,C2 Two large coins

This is a simple method of tossing a coin.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Start with a coin held edgewise between the tips of the thumb and finger 1.
The coin should be parallel to the fingers.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Quickly squeeze on the edges of the coin so that the coin flys away from the
fingers. A variation I have been working on is to hold an m&m between the
fingers with the arm fully extended. Now perform the toss so that the m&m flies
the entire length of the arm to be caught in the mouth. Protective glasses
should be worn when practicing this trick!

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
Place two coins on a flat surface so that their edges are touching. Now push
on the outer edge of one of the coins so both coins slide across the surface
in a column. At first the speed will be slow as you make error corrections but
with practice you can increase the speed. Now try pushing the column around in
large circles etc. This can also be performed with three coins but it is much
harder.

I find the difficult part of this trick is holding one (or more) coins between
finger 3 and 4. To make it slightly easier adjust the starting position so that
the coins eventually finish in a comfortable position between fingers 3 and 4.
For me the starting position is at the middle of the middle joint of finger 2.
<P>

In learning this trick I first started practicing the <A HREF="#EdgeWalk">
Edge Walk</A> with two coins. Once this becomes smooth practice the flourish
with just two coins finishing with the coins in all possible finishing
positions. Then do the same with three coins and then four should be pretty
easy.<P>

When performing this trick a nice effect is achieved as follows. Start with the
stack of coins held in a hand, fingers pointing towards the audience. Drop the
hand down so that the fingers point to the ground. Perform the flourish during
this dropping motion and bring the hand back to the start position when the
flourish is complete.<P>

Try transferring the finished flourish from one hand to another.<P>

Apparently the flourish can be done with five coins, the fifth coin becomes

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Toss them a small distance upwards. If you practice the throw you should be
able to get the coins to seperate in the air but still remain in a line
parellel to your body. As you throw the coins swing your hand out wide, then
swing it back and catch all coins in one sweeping motion.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
The best effect is achieved by maximising the amount of seperation of the coins
while they are in the air, and the amount of sideways sweeping motion of the
arm.<P>

If you hold the stack in both hands and perform the throw you can get a much
larger seperation of the coins in the air. The coins can then be caught as
normal, or you can catch them with a clapping motion between both hands

This trick involves throwing coins from one hand to the other so that they

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Hold a coin edgewise between the thumb and fingers 2 of the right hand. Now
toss the coin to the left hand from above so that it lands held edgewise
between the thumb and fingers 1 and 2. The coin will land in finger 2 and be
supported from the sides by finger 1 and the thumb. Continue throwing coins in
this manner until you have a stack of coins held in the left hand.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
The first coin is the hardest. Once that is in place it helps to guide the
others into the stack. I can make a stack of about 8 coins like this.<P>

A variation that I have recently started trying is to start with a stack in the
right hand, throw coins one at a time to the left handed stack, then repeat to
get to the start. If this is performed quickly it looks pretty good.

be practiced seperately.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI>Toss the middle three coins from the stack to be caught in a similiar
      manner in the left hand. To perform the toss swing the right hand down
      towards the left and slightly seperate the thumb and finger 1. The
      middle coins will come out of the stack and the outer coins will remain
      due to the friction on the fingers. This friction can be increased to
      help the trick by pressing hard on the outer coins before the throw.
  <LI>Toss the middle coin from the left stack to the middle of the right
      stack. Perform the toss as described above. The catch is performed by
      quickly seperating the thumb and finger 1 and closing them again when the
      coin is between them. Catching is the most difficult part of the trick.

  <LI> Now flick the edge of the coin with finger 2.
</OL>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
There are some disadvantages to this method:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>You need to rest the base of the coin on the surface on which you are
      spinning it. This can be a problem if the surface is slippery as the coin
      tends to fall over fairly easily.
  <LI>You can only get the coin spinning anti-clockwise. This can be overcome
      by holding the coin with finger 2 and flicking with finger 1 but this is
      even more awkward.
</UL>
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="ThumbSpin"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Thumb Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This methods involves holding the coin in two fingers and flicking it with the
thumb.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
Hold the coin flatwise by an edge, between fingers 1 and 2. The coin should be
extending on the palm side of the hand. Hold the hand with the fingers pointing
down toward the surface on which you want to spin the coin.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Flick the coin (on the opposite edge from where you hold it) with the
thumb (by flicking off finger 3). The coin should fly off and land on the
surface spinning. 

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
The method is slower and harder to control than the
<A HREF="#TwoFingerSpin">Two Finger Spin</A> described
below, but it is good because you can get the coin to fly a fair way from your
hand before it lands, without moving the hand.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="TwoFingerSpin"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Two Finger Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
The problem with the previous methods is that they are slow and it is hard to
control the resulting motion of the coin.<BR>

This variation is the best one that I have found. It is fast and provides good
control.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Start</B><TD>
For this method hold the hand out flat, palm up. Balance the coin flatwise with
its middle over the first joint of finger 2. Now grab the edges of the coin
with the inner sides of fingers 1 and 3.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Description</B><TD>
Place the bottom edge of the coin on the table and quickly pull back with
finger 1 and push forwards with finger 3. The coin should now be spinning.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <B>Comments</B><TD>
I find this method to be the best. With this method it is also easier to
control the motion of the spinning coin. The only disadvantage with this method
is that it is harder to get the coin spinning in the opposite direction.<P>

Another good thing about this method is that the spin can be generated without
having a surface to start on. You can toss a coin onto the table from a
distance and it will land spinning. You can toss it up and catch it on a book,
etc.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="DirectionControl"></A>
<CENTER><H3>Direction Control</H3></CENTER>

Practice controlling the motion of the coin after you set it spinning. If you
use your right hand and spin the coin anticlockwise the tendancy of the coin is
to spin in a leftwards arc. With practice you can control the diamater and
duration of this arc.<P>

You can also make the coin spin without any lateral motion. If you combine this
with the <A HREF="#TwoFingerSpin">Two Finger Spin</A> method you can get the
coin spinning on very small surfaces which looks really cool. An extreme
example of this, and an excellent trick is to balance a US half dollar, heads
up on the tips of the thumb and fingers 1 and 2 of one hand. Now take a one
cent piece and make it spin on the surface of the half dollar! The trick is to
prevent the one cent piece from spinning of the edge of the half dollar by
adjusting the angle of the half dollar. This is really hard but very
impressive, even if you only keep the one cent piece spinning for a few
seconds.<P>

       They are held with the thumb and finger 2 just above the point where
       they touch.
  <LI> Now place finger 1 on the top edge of the left coin, and finger 3 on the

Step 3 is the most important step so work on the timing and speed of the coin
drops until you can drop all coins in one smooth shower. You can also cheat by
only picking up the top two coins from the left stack. This will not look any
