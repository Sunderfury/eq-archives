<TITLE>The Loch Ness Monster</TITLE>
<H1>Is the Loch Ness monster really real?</H1>

Well, much  recent  evidence  has
led to the belief that in the scottish highlands many years ago a
most unusual event took place one dim and misty evening,  and  it
was  the  discovery of this event which caused quite a stir among
the followers of various local Loch Ness Sects  that  led  to  me
changing  my way of life entirely. I became aware of all of this,
not because I have ever taken a great interest  in  the  research
being  done at the Loch Ness, but because, by some bizarre postal
mistake, I obtained a letter meant for another  person  with  the
same  name  as  I.  Enclosed  with  the  letter was a copy of the
original diary that described the events  that  took  place  that
night  in  a  small village nestled in a scotish bay. I enclose a
copy of this diary entry in the hopes that it may turn around all
the  things  that  you  have come to believe are possible in this
world, and perhaps others.<P>

<B>November 12, 1329</B><P>

   Several nights ago an event took place that was so strange and
incredible  that  I  hesitate to write it down here for fear that
someone will read this and know that I have finally gone  mad  in
my old age. But even so I can not let such amazing truths be lost
and I will hide this account,  in  the  hopes  that  someday  a
reader  of  the  distant  future  will  be  able  to believe it's
contents.<P>

   It was quite cool during the day before the  event  transpired
and  it  was  deemed by the locals that a storm was a brewin'. Of
course even the tourists, of which there  were  quite  a  few  as
bonnie  scotland  was a great attraction to the brits from across
the ocean, could tell there was a "storm a brewin" as they  could
see  the  large  and  darkly  ominous clouds that swept from deep
within the ocean to  cover  the  hills  around  about  the  small
village,  until  people  had  to light lanterns to mark their way
through the streets. Though the bay was partly sheltered  by  the
hills  which,  in typical scottish fashion rose from the sea like
great castle walls, tales were told by  the  old  folk  of  great
storms  which  rose up and destroyed everything in their path. It
was felt by the men of the village that it would be wise to  heed
the warnings from the gods, and they spent the day bringing their
small fishing boats out of the bay, and up onto the  rocky  beach
that seperated the village from the sea.<P>

   The reason for my presence in this place, far  from  my  usual
civilized  habitats  was  due to a falling out with my supervisor
recently, and as a result of this he sent me  to  this  place  to
research an article about scottish folklore. I was determined not
to let myself become depressed by my assignment,  and  wanted  to
enjoy  myself  as  much as possible and it was with this attitude
that I decided to take a walk among the hills and watch the storm
approach.  Even  now,  with  the  benifit  of hindsight I can not
determine wether the decision to go walking among  the  hills  on
that  cold  November  afternoon  was  good or bad luck. Perhaps I
shall go mad with the knowledge that I gained on that night.<P>

   My stroll took me away from the village,  and  slowly  up  the
side  of  one  of  the huge hills that surrounded the village. At
first it was easy going, but as the way became steadily  steeper,
I  had to stop several times to gain my breath, and it was during
one such stop that I thought I heard voices ahead of  me,  but  I
peered  into  the  gloom  towards  the top of the track and could
discern no movement there. I pressed on, keen to get to  the  top
and  back  before  dusk, and before the storm arrived in all it's
fury.  The last part of the track was so steep that I  often  had
to  use  my  arms to pull me over the large rocks that dotted the
hillside, but eventually I made it to the top and  was  presented
with such a view that it made the journey worthwhile. I could see
quite a ways out to sea, and there was definately going to  be  a
storm  before  the  night  had  passed.  Already a light wind was
blowing and my coat was flapping crazily in front of  me  as  the
breeze grew stronger.<P>

   I had another look out to sea before deciding to head back  to
the village, and it was then that I was struck by some oddness to
the breeze that was making my scarf blow like a mad thing, as  if
it  was  reaching  out  towards the sea, and the mass of churning
clouds that approached from there.  Perhaps  I  was  still  tired
from  the walk up but it took my mind a while to realize that the
wind was not coming from the sea, as logic told me it should, but
from  the  hills  behind me. As I realized this astonishing fact,
and turned into the direction of the  wind,  I  again  thought  I
heard  voices from down in the valley that lay in that direction.
I had been told that Loch Ness, a vast lake occupied that  valley
and had planned on taking a boat trip upon it later in the week.<P>

   Well, I was sure I had heard voices  in  that  direction  and,
knowing  that there were no other settlements in that area, I was
curious as to who else would be  out  in  the  hills  on  such  a
frightful night. I carefully approached the rim of the valley and
after picking a careful path a small way down the edge  was  able
to  see  the  Loch  below,  and distant figures besides it's dark
waters. The night was now quickly approaching and I  had  decided
that  it was time to head back to the village, but as I turned to
leave these people to whatever buisness they had, my foot slipped
on  the  loose  ground and I fell backwards, down the side of the
hill towards the valley below.<P>

   I must have blacked out from the shock of the fall, for I  can
remember  no part of that dreadful descent. When I first regained
my senses, loose rocks were still racing  down  the  hillside  to
fall  nearby,  so  I  could not have lost my senses for long. The
pain was terrible, and as I tried to pull myself  to  my  feet  I
noticed  that my leg was pointing at a most unfamiliar angle, and
must surely be broken.  My only  hope  now  was  to  attract  the
attention  of  the  people  by  the Ness, if they had not already
heard my unfortunate fall.<P>

   Now that I had turned my attention towards  the  figures  that
stood by the lake I became aware of a chanting and singing coming
from amongst their misdt. The tallest fellow  of  the  group  was
standing  upon a rock by the shore and shouting out over the lake
in a language that must surely have been long forgotton  by  now.
The sounds of the unfamiliar words struck an unexpected terror in
me that I could not then, nor now explain.<P>

   The shouting and chanting had reached a cresendo, and finally,
thankfully  it  stopped  and all became quiet for a brief moment.
Again the man on the rock called out in the archaic language  and
one  of  the  figures  stepped  forth,  held  in  it's  arms  the
struggling form of a child. As the figure approaced  the  man  on
the  rock  my  fear grew, and when the man on the rock produced a
large gleaming knife from within his dark robes I felt  a  terror
so  keen  and  sharp  I  almost  fainted.  Thinking back now I am
ashamed to say that my fear was not so much for the child, whom I
knew  was  in grave danger, but for myself should I be discovered
among the rocks where I lay.<P>

   The man waved the knife above his head and again  called  out,
and  wether  in response to his call or not I cannot say, but the
waters of the Loch started churning most furiously and I sensed a
large  mass  below the waters beside the man. The chanting of the
other figures circling the man grew louder and more intense until
at  last my fears bacame realized when the man leaped of the rock
brining his knife down into the childs body.<P>

   Several things happened within the space of a breath then  and
I  fainted towards the end of it, but I shall try to describe the
climax of this fiendish ritual that was being performed.<P>

   As the knife struck the child a bolt of lightning  arced  from
the  sky  and  into the waters of the Loch. Thunder rolled across
the hills, and as the lightning struck the boiling waters a large
monsterous  shape  emerged  from the depths. All that I could see
was a long thick neck, upon which sat the head of  this  terrible
beast.  It surged forward through the waters, and as it approaced
the man discarded his bloody knife and raised the child above his
head. The neck of the beast arched out over the man and it's jaws
came down to engulf the childs body. And then as quick as it  had
come the beast sunk below the waters with it's gruesome prize and
was gone.<P>

   The robed man now turned and as lightning  struck  again,  his
face,  which up until this horrible moment had remained hidden by
the gloom, was revealed to me. It was not a human face, of that I
am  sure,  for  he  had  bright  yellow eyes and long sharp teeth
protruding from his mouth. It was at this sight  that  I  fainted
with  the  sure  knowledge that this demon had seen me and that I
would be the next meal of the terrible beast of the Ness.<P>

   When I awoke I found that it was morning and that I was in  my
bed  back in the village. A woman was attending to my wounds, and
upon my enquiries told me that when I had not returned last night
a  few men went out searching for me, and found me lying near the
waters of the Ness, almost dead from loss of blood, and  mumbling
incoherently.<P>

   It is here that I end my account of that dreadful night and of
the monster of Loch Ness.<P>
