This page tries to describe the various tricks that can be done with a
kendama.<BR>

First a dodgy picture of a Kendama, as I don't have a fancy scanner or
anything like that :-(<P>

The correct way to hold the kendama will depend on your preference, and the
tricks you are doing. There are two main methods for holding the Kendama:

<UL>
  <LI><B>Pencil Grip</B>: Hold the Kendama as if it were a pencil.
  <LI><B>Sword Grip</B>: Hold the Kendama as if it were a sword.
</UL>

I prefer the pencil grip for most tricks, but the sword grip works better for
other tricks.<P>

There are three categories of tricks. The first is catches and involve holding
the kendama with the ball dangling on the string, then catching the ball on
some part of the kendama in some way. The second involves starting with the
ball on the kendama, and tossing it from one part of the kendama to another.
The third category includes stuff that does not really fit in the first
two :-)<p>

There are two ways to do most of the catches described here. The difference is
in the way you bring up the ball.<P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B>Pull up</B>: This method involves pulling the ball straight up and
       placing the kendama under it and catching it as it reaches it's highest
       point.
  <LI> <B>Swing up</B>: In this method you swing the ball through 180 degrees
       and have it land on top of the kendama.
</UL>

I describe the pull up version in most cases as I find that the easiest
method.<P>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>CupCatch</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
Pull up the ball and catch it on one of the cups.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>SpikeCatch1</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
For this catch pull up the ball (trying to keep the hole pointing down) and
quickly move the kendama under it to catch the ball on the spike.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="SpikeCatch2"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Spike Catch 2</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
For this catch hold the kendama horizontal (the two side cups will be facing
sideways). Pull up the ball and catch it balanced on the side of the spike and
the edges of the two cups.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Spike Catch 3</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
This one is tricky. Hold the kendama horizontal, with either side cup facing
up. Pull up the ball and catch it balanced on the side of the spike and against
the edge of the upper cup!!
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="SpikeToBallCatch"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Spike To Ball Catch</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
Hold the ball with the hole up and the kendama dangling. Swing the kendama up
and catch it with the spike in the hole.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>End Cup To Ball Catch</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
Hole the ball with the kendama dangling. Pull up the kendama and catch it on
the ball, on the end cup. This trick is hard if the ball is slippery.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Large Cup To Ball Catch</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
As above but catch the kendama on the large cup. You have to swing the kendama
to that it rotates enough.

<A NAME="SidePull"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Side Pull</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
Hole the kendama in the right hand, the ball in the left with the string
stretched out in front of you. Pull the spike down wards so that the ball arcs
across and lands on the end cup. Toss the ball back to the left hand.

<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Cup To Cup</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
Toss the ball from one cup to another. I find with the pencil grip, large cup
up, the small cup is the hardest to catch on as the hand has to be twisted
right around.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Around The World</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
Start with the ball on the large cup. Toss it up. Move the kendama in a circle
around the ball and catch it back on the kendama.<P>

<B>Double Around the World</B>:<BR>
As above but move the kendama around the ball twice.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Cup To Spike</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
Hold the kendama like a sword with the spike pointing away and the larg cup
facing up. Start with the ball on the large cup with the hole pointing up and
back at a 45 degree angle (towards your face). Toss the ball up, and make the
hole spin downwards and catch the ball on the spike.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="CupToSpike2"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Cup To Spike 2</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
Hold the kendama as above but with the two side cups horizontal. Start with the
ball balanced on the side of the spike and the edges of the two side cups. The
hole should be facing down. Pull the kendama back slightly, then push it
forwards so that the spike goes in the hole.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Cup On Ball To Spike</CENTER>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="javascript:DisplayVideo('','.mov')">Video</A><TD>
Start by holding the ball and balancing the kendama on the ball with the end
cup to the bottom. Toss the kendama of the ball, allow it to rotate 180 degrees
to be caught with the spike in the hole.

Swing the ball up in a 180 degree arc. Release the kendama, catch the ball as
it reaches it's highest point, swing the kendama up in the same arc, release
the ball, catch the kendama, swing the ball up into a catch on the end cup.
