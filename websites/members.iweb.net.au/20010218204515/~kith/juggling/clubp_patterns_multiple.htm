<h1>Five people/lottsa clubs</h1>

<p>In all the patterns given here, no two passers are exactly synched. 
Each one individually does an even right-left rythm, but they're separated 
by intervals of one fifth of a beat from each other. By 'beat', I mean the 
amount of time between consecutive throws of the same hand. The amount of 
time between between throws of opposite hands of the same person is a half 
a beat.</p>


<h2>Five people, 16 clubs</h2>

Initial setup:</p>


<pre>              D1     2C</pre>
<pre>             2         1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>          1               2</pre>
<pre>          E               B</pre>
<pre>           2             1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>                 2A2</pre>

<p>Explanation: Person A, standing at the bottom of the diagram, starts 
out with two clubs in each hand. Persons B, C, D, and E, standing in that 
order going counterclockwise from A, all start with two clubs in their 
right hand and one club in their left.</p>

<p>Direction of throws: All people throw selves with their left hands, and throw 
to the left hand of the second person on the right with their right hand, 
so A throws to C, C throws to E, E throws to B, B throws to D, and D 
throws to A.</p>

<p>How to do it: A starts by throwing a pass to C. A fifth of a beat later, 
C follows by by throwing a pass to E. A fifth of a beat after that, E 
throws to B, then B throws to D, then D throws to A. A fifth of a beat 
after that, A makes another pass to C. (A's self was probably between 
C's and D's passes.) All people continue to throw left selves and right 
passes, and the pattern will naturally fall into an even rythm.</p>


<h2>Five people, 17 clubs</h2>

<p>(This one might be a bit collision-prone. If that becomes too much 
of a problem, skip to 18 clubs.)</p>

<p>Initial setup:</p>


<pre>              D1     2C</pre>
<pre>             2         1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>          1               2</pre>
<pre>          E               B</pre>
<pre>           2             2</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>                 2A2</pre>

<p>Direction of throws: same as with 16 clubs.</p>

<p>How to do it: The same off-by-a-fifth arrangement as with 16 clubs, 
only now the order is A, B, C, D, then E rather than A, C, E, B then D 
like it was with 16 clubs.</p>

<p>An interesting property of this pattern is that there's a hole in the 
middle of it which contains no clubs, and circles around 
counterclockwise. If you get this going solidly, find someone who's 
quick-footed and foolhardy enough to run around in that hole. If that 
starts going well, try takeouts.</p>

<h2>Five people, 18 clubs</h2>

<p>Initial setup:</p>


<pre>              D2     2C</pre>
<pre>             2         1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>          2               2</pre>
<pre>          E               B</pre>
<pre>           2             1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>                 2A2</pre>

<p>Direction of throws: the same as with 16 and 17 clubs.</p>

<p>How to do it: The same off-by-a-fifth arrangement as with 16 and 17 
clubs, only now the order is A, E, D, C, then B.</p>

<p>18 clubs has the same kind of hole in it that 17 does, but the hole 
moves clockwise instead of counterclockwise.</p>

<p>19 clubs is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<h2>15 object whirlwind</h2>

<p>(better try this one with balls first.)</p>

<p>This pattern has the interesting property that each object is either 
always thrown and caught by left hands or always thrown and caught by 
right hands, so I'll do each part separately first then combine them 
together at the end.</p>

<p>The left hands - </p>

<p>Initial setup:</p>


<pre>              D2      C</pre>
<pre>                       1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>          2</pre>
<pre>          E               B</pre>
<pre>                         1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>                 1A</pre>

<p>(Note that there are seven objects total.)</p>

<p>Direction of throws: A throws to C, C throws to E, E throws to B, 
B throws to D, and D throws to A</p>

<p>How to do it: D makes the first throw, followed at intervals of one 
fifth by E, then A, then B, and then C. Keep going.</p>

<p>The right hands - </p>

<p>Initial setup:</p>

<pre>              D      2C</pre>
<pre>             1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>                          2</pre>
<pre>          E               B</pre>
<pre>           1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>                  A2</pre>

<p>Direction of throws: A throws to D, D throws to B, B throws to E, 
E throws to C, and C throws to A.</p>

<p>How to do it: A makes the first throw, followed a fifth of a beat later 
by B, then C, then D, and then E. Throws are slightly higher than 
throws from the left hands.</p>

<p>Everything put together - </p>

<p>Initial setup:</p>

<pre>              D2     2C</pre>
<pre>             1         1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>          2               2</pre>
<pre>          E               B</pre>
<pre>           1             1</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>                 1A2</pre>

<p>Direction of throws: same as for left and right hands individually.</p>

<p>How to do it: A starts by throwing with the right hand. A tenth of a 
beat later, D makes a throw with the left hand. A tenth later, B throws 
with the right hand. E then throws with the left hand, and finally 
C throws with the right hand. All passers proceed with an even right-left 
rythm. Remember to throw higher with the right hands. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Don't be too discouraged by the tenth beats - just get the order in which 
everything is done right, and go for it. The timing will occur naturally.</p>
