This page describes the manipulation of small objects such as coins, pencils,
cards, and others. Examples of the types of tricks described include walking
a coin across the back of the knuckles, spinning a pencil through the fingers,
and others.<P>

<H2>Notation</H2>

There is a common set of notation and terms used throughout these pages.<P>

In all descriptions the fingers are numbered 1-4 with the index finger being
finger 1 and the pinkie being finger 4. The thumb is the thumb :-)<P>

The joints are numbered 1-3 with 1 being the innermost joint and 3 being the
outermost joint.<P>

Outwards is in the direction of the fingertips.<P>

For some tricks I describe the two faces of the coin as 'heads' and 'tails'.
If you don't have a coin with heads and tails you'll have to improvise :-)
Coins can also be held <B>flatwise</B> by holding the faces of the coin, or
<B>edgewise</B> by holding the edges of the coin.<P>

<B>Dynamic</B> - Dynamic moves involve imparting on the object a certain amount
   of spin so that it spins around the fingers in various ways until caught
   again.<P>
<B>Static</B> - Static moves are ones in which firm control of the object is
   always maintained.<P>
<B>Tip</B> - The bit of the pen you write with.<P>
<B>End</B> - The other end of the pen.<P>

<HR>
<H2>Difficulty</H2>

I have attempted to assign a rough idea of the difficulty of each trick. The
following table shows the scale along with a rough guide as to what that level
means in real terms.<P>

These tricks are reasonable easy. The basic trick will take 5-10 minutes to
get working but will require 2-3 hours of practice to get smooth.

Now we are looking at about 20-50 hours of practice. Tricks at this level
start requiring high levels of manual dexterity.

These tricks are very hard and require a lot of practice. I have spent hundreds
of hours on tricks at this level to get them smooth.

These are the sort of tricks that probably take years of practice to become
proficient at. Either that or they are impossible. There are currently only
two tricks at this level.
