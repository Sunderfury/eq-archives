<H2> Club Passing </H1>

Here is a collection of club passing patterns I have collected from the net, from other
people or of my own invention. If you know of any patterns I have not listed let me know.<p>

The first section describes the notation used, the second section describes some passing
counts (timing of throws for two people) and some tricks and the third section describes
patterns for two or more people.<p>

  <a href="clubp_timings.htm">Club Passing - Timings</a><p>
  <a href="clubp_patterns.htm">Club Passing - Patterns</a><p>
</ul>

DISCLAIMER - Some of the patterns described may be incorrect either because I messed up,
have not done the pattern or can do the pattern but can't work out how I do it. If you
find anything wrong with the patterns or know alternative names for patterns let me know.
