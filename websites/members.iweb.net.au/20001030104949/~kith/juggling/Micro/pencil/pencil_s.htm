<H2>Introduction</H2>

Pencil Manipulation is a form of contact juggling in which a pencil or pencil
like object (pencil/pen/cigarette/toothbrush etc) is twirled, flipped and spun
with the fingers.<P>

When learning some of the dynamic moves it is easier to practice with something
large as it will make the trick slower and easier to learn. You can then reduce
the size of the object until you are able to perform it with a pencil.<P>

NOTE: All tricks are static unless otherwise specified.<P>

This is basically a contact juggling move in which an object is rolled along
the arm.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B> <TD>
Start with the forearm parallel to the ground with a pencil balanced on the
fingers, perpendicular to them.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Description</B> <TD>
Tilt the arm back and move the arm foreward so that the pencil rolls down the
arm to the elbow joint. Reverse the move so that the pencil returns to the
start.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
With a lot of practice a pen can be balanced on it's end on various parts of
the body. A nice variation is to balance a pen on an extended index finger.<P>

Balancing things is a common jugglers trick so take a look at the
<A HREF="http://www.juggling.org">Juggling Information Service</A> for tips
on balancing objects.<P>

An simple move is to balance the pen at its middle on an index finger.<P>

In this trick the pencil is twirled around the back of the hand and back across
the front to return to the start after rotating 540 degrees.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B><TD>
Start by holding the end of the pencil with the thumb and finger 1. The hand
should be held flat with the palm down and the pencil pointing upwards.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI> Push upwards with the thumb and at the same time loosen your grip on the
       pencil so that it falls across the back of the knuckles. Raise finger 4
       so that the pen is resting on the other fingers and under finger 4.
  <LI> Release the pencil with the thumb and let the tip of the pencil swing
       down to point towards the ground. The pencil should be held in the
       middle with fingers 3 and 4.
  <LI> Rotate the pencil 90 degrees so that the tip of the pencil is directly
       below finger 1.
  <LI> Place finger 1 under the pen and release the grip on the pencil with
       fingers 3 and 4. The pen should now be held by its tip with fingers 1
       and 2, the end pointing towards the ground.
  <LI> Now grab the pencil with the thumb and finger 1, remove finger 2 and
       return to the starting position (except now you are holding the tip of
       the pencil).

This trick involves performing a <A HREF="BehindTheHandTwirl">Behind The Hand
Twirl</A> on each hand and transferring the pencils from hand to hand during
the move.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B><TD>
Start with pen 1 in the left hand in the normal starting position and pen 2 in
the right hand, between fingers 3 and 4.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Description</B><TD>

  <LI> Perform half of the normal twirl with each hand. Pen 1 is now between

</OL>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Comments</B><TD>
A slightly better version is to alternate between one full twirl and one and a
half twirls before exchanging the pens. This way the pens are in different
positions for each exchange and they are twirling longer which looks better.

In this trick you place a cigarette on the hand, slap that arm and the
cigarette leaps up to be caught in the mouth.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B><TD>
Hold the forearm out parallel to the ground, palm up. Place a cigarette in the
middle of the palm parallel to the fingers with the filter pointing out.

If you attempt to keep the tip of the pen stationary during the rotation (by
moving the hand in a circle) you can produce an interesting illusion. If
performed correctly it will look like the tip of the pen is fixed in the air
and you are rotating the rest of the pen about this point.

<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 1, '../..' );</SCRIPT></CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This trick involves spinning a pen horizontally between the tips of three
fingers of each hand.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B><TD>
Start by placing the thumb, finger 1 and finger 2 of the right hand together
so that the tips for a triangle. Point this triangle upwards and balance a pen
at it's mid point on the triangle. Form a similiar triangle with the left hand
and place it on the pen (over the right handed triangle). The left fingers are
pointing towards the ground.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Description</B><TD>
Now perform the moves of the <A HREF="#PenSpin">Pen Spin</A> simultaneously
with the fingers of each hand so that the pen spins in a plane parellel to the
ground.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Comments</B><TD>
For this trick (and the next two tricks) make sure that contact is only made
with the tips of the fingers. Otherwise you might as well be doing a normal
spin.

right hand, while the left index finger helps maintain the balance.

<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Three Fingertip Spin

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
For this trick you simply remove the left index finger (Although "simply" is
probably not the right word :-)

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Comments</B><TD>
This is hard because the pen only rests on the fingertips and it is hard to
maintain the balance, while keeping the pen spinning smoothly. To practice this
I marked the centre of the pen allowing me to easily tell where the balance
point is, and I could then keep this point centered on the finger tips.<P>

This trick looks really nice when you can do it fast and smoothly.<P>

This trick will be static when first learning due to the slow spin, but as
skill increases and the speed of the pen increases it will become a dynamic
trick.

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This is a trick in which an L shaped object is spun on the end of the
finger.<P>

I originally saw this trick performed with a toothbrush but it can be done with
any L shaped object. It can be done with a pen with a bit of modification. You
need a pen with the type of lid that has a long pointy bit for clipping the pen
to a shirt. Bend back the pointy bit until it is at a 90 degree angle (or
slightly less) with the pen.<P>

The pen should look like this:<P>

<IMG SRC="../../gfx/pencil.jpg" ALT="Pen with pocket clip on lid bent back."><P>

Make sure that the resulting bent lid at least as long as the width of your
index finger as this makes the trick easier.<P>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B><TD>
Hold out an extended right index finger, palm pointing down. Balance the
underside of the bent lid on top of the finger so that the pen is perpendicular
to the ground and against the right side of the finger.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Description</B><TD>
Rotate the finger in
clockwise circles so that the pen also rotates. The start is done with a large
circle, but once the pen is spinning make the circles smaller.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Comments</B><TD>
You can do this in the other direction by starting with the pen on the other
side of the finger. Also try it with other fingers and both hands at once.<P>

The spin can be stopped in several ways (These descriptions assume clockwise
spinning on the right index finger):<P>

<UL>
  <LI> As the pen comes over the top of the finger extend finger 4 (the pinkie)
       and let the pen land on it. The pen should now be resting on the back of
       finger 1 and finger 4. From here you can go back into the spin by
       removing finger 4.
  <LI> As the tip of the pen swings around to point directly up grab the lower
       part of the pen (The part below the index finger) between the thumb and
       the index finger. The timing for this method is tricky. From here you
       can let the pen fall to the right and continue spinning.
  <LI> As the pen swings down to point towards the ground rotate the hand to
       the right 90 degrees (so that the palm faces left) and bend the index
       finger. If timed right the pen will fly of to the left to be caught in
       the left hand.
  <LI> I can't do this reliably. As the tip of the pen swings over the top of
       the index finger, reverse the rotation of the finger. The pen comes of
       the finger and the finger hits the pen near the tip reversing its spin.
       The end of the pen should then flick up into the hand where it is
       caught.
</UL>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Variations</B><TD>
<UL>
  <LI> Two pens on the same finger. This doesn't usually last long.
  <LI> Toss the pen in the air, catch it on a finger and go straight into a
       spin. I can do this occasionally but it's pretty hard.
</UL>

Here is some stuff I'm working on but can't do yet.<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Try two pens on the same hand. One on the finger 1 and the other on
       finger 4. The pens keep colliding so you need to either have short pens
       or work out how to offset the spinning pens.
  <LI> I'm trying to work out a way to transfer the spinning pen to another
       finger. No luck yet :-(

In this trick the pen is held horizontally between the palms and flipped about
in various ways.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B><TD>
Hold both hands out in front of you with the palms pointing in towards each
other. Hold a pen so that each end of the pen touches one of the palms. The pen
should be parallel to the ground.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Description</B><TD>
Now toss the pen by pulling up with one hand. Make the pen flip 180 degrees to
be caught in the starting position, although the ends have changed places.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Comments</B><TD>
The flip can be performed vertically or horizontally. Try doing 360 degree
flips or more.<P>

A neat illusion can be created as follows. Start as above. Move both hands up
as if you are about to throw the pen. Push slightly to the right and remove the
left hand. Don't flip the pen but make it remain in place, still touching the
right hand. Momentarily this looks like the pen is sticking to the right hand.
This move is similiar in concept to the standard cigar box move. To extend the
illusion alternate between removing the left, then right hands.

The left hand can either keep a solid grip on the end of the pen or perform
a pen spin or finger 1 spin.<P>

A nice variation is to have both hands perform the same moves that the right

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This trick involves spinning the pencil around finger 2.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B><TD>
To start the trick hold out the hand with the palm down. Place a pencil so that
its end is resting on the web of skin between the base of the thumb and finger
1 while the other end rests on the first knuckle of finger 3. About 1/3 of the
pencil should be hanging over the end of finger 3. The second joint of finger 2
should be resting on top of the middle of the pencil and curled slightly
inwards, while fingers 1 and 3 are straight.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Description</B><TD>
Now apply pressure downwards with finger 2 and release the grip on the end of
the pencil (where it touches the web of the thumb). The pencil will now perform
a 360 degree anticlockwise spin to be caught between fingers 1 and 2. It should
be pointing in the same direction as it was at the start.<P>

During the spin the pencil moves as follows:<P>
<UL>
  <LI> <B>1st 90 degrees</B>: The end of the pencil moves anticlockwise until
       it is under finger 4. The tip of the pencil is over finger 1.
  <LI> <B>2nd 90 degrees</B>: The end of the pencil continues anticlockwise and
       the entire pencil moves to the top of the hand. It is now basically
       resting on top of finger 2, parallel to this finger with the end of the
       pencil pointing away from the hand.
  <LI> <B>Rest of the spin</B>: The pencil continues spinning in the same
       direction and the end of the pencil moves under finger 1 to be caught
       between finger 1 and finger 2.
</UL>

To finish the trick place the end of the pencil at the web of the thumb and
move the top of the pencil back to the starting position. With practice you
should be able to perform this trick continually.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Variations</B><TD>
<B>Finger 3</B>: Start as for the <A HREF="Finger2Spin">Finger 2</A> version
but with the top of the pen on finger 4. The pen now spins around finger 3 to
be caught between fingers 2 and 3. This version is harder than the Finger 2
version.<P>

<B>Finger 1</B>: Start as for the <A HREF="Finger2Spin">Finger 2</A> version
but with the top of the pen on finger 2. The pen now spins around finger 1 to
be caught between the thumb and finger 1. The catch is slightly different to
the other versions.<P>

<B>Finger 2 and 3</B>: Start as for the Finger 3 version but allow the pen to
spin around both fingers 3 and 2, to be caught between fingers 1 and 2.

In this trick the pencil is spun around the thumb.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Start</B><TD>
Start with the hand held with the palm held perpendicular to the ground. Hold
the end of the pen between the thumb and fingers 1 and 2. Finger 1 should be
about 1cm from the end of the pen and the thumb should be roughly between
fingers 1 and 2. The thumb should be making contact with the pen at the lower
portion of the pad.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Description</B><TD>
Push firmly against the pen with finger 2 and then release the pen with finger
1. The pen should now spin around the thumb (just below the thumb nail) to be
caught between the thumb and finger 1. The action should be just like snapping
the fingers.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Comments</B><TD>
The <B>Double Thumb Spin</B> can also be performed in which the pen performs
two rotations around the thumb before being caught.<P>

There are several variations that can be performed:<P>

<H3>Thumb Wrap<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 1, '../..' );</SCRIPT></H3>

Toss the pen straight up without imparting any spin on it. The pen should
be made to hit the thumb just below its middle point. If performed correctly
the pen should now rapidly spin around the thumb to be caught in it's starting
position.<P>

<H3>Fast Spin<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 1, '../..' );</SCRIPT></H3>

Do the same pen toss as described above but make the end of the pen hit the
thumb. The pen will spin 360 degrees, very fast, to be caught in the starting
position.<P>

<H3>Fake Spin<SCRIPT>WriteDifficulty( 2, '../..' );</SCRIPT></H3>

Toss up the pen so that it will perform a normal 360 degree spin. After the
toss the palm rotates to the right. It should now be perpendicular to the
ground with the fingers pointing away from you and the thumb entended to the
left. As the pen completes the first 180 degrees of the spin the tip of the
pen should be directly over the thumb. The thumb hits the tip of the pen and
reverses the direction of its spin. The pen now spins 360 degrees in the
reverse direction (away from you) to be caught in the normal starting position
(Although the tip of the pen is now pointing towards you).
