			One person has died after receiving a fecal transplant containing drug-resistant bacteria, the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.<br />
<br />
The FDA is warning health care providers that the use of the so-called fecal microbiota for transplantation (FMT) can lead to serious or life-threatening infections.<br />
<br />
Two patients with weakened immune systems who received FMT from the same donor developed serious infections, the FDA said. One patient died.<br />
<br />
The FDA noted that the donor stool had not been tested for the drug-resistant bacteria, called extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli, prior to the transplantation. After the illnesses and death occurred, however, a stored preparation of the donor stool was tested, and found to be positive for the identical strain of bacteria found in the two patients.<br />
<br />
The FDA statement does not specify why the patients received the fecal transplants. However, the procedure is commonly used to treat a difficult-to-treat bacterial infection called C. difficile.<br />
<br />
C. diff infections kill 29,000 Americans a year and make 450,000 sick in the United States alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />
<br />
The treatment involves obtaining stool from a healthy donor, and transplanting a processed version of that stool into the patient. The collection of bacteria found in the healthy stool — called the microbiota — repopulate the colon of the patient, and essentially crowd out the infectious bacteria.

<br />
Labour has accused Donald Trump’s top official, Mike Pompeo, of trying to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, after he was caught on tape telling Jewish leaders that he would “push back” against the party’s leadership.<br />
<br />
In a recording leaked to the Washington Post, the US secretary of state was asked what he would do if Corbyn were to be elected as prime minister, after sustained criticism over Labour’s handling of accusations of antisemitism within the party.<br />
<br />
The questioner said: “Would you be willing to work with us to take on actions if life becomes very difficult for Jews in the UK?” In response, Pompeo appeared to suggest that he would seek to intervene in the debate before Corbyn had a chance to become prime minister.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
“It could be that Mr Corbyn manages to run the gauntlet and get elected,” he said on the recording. “It’s possible. You should know, we won’t wait for him to do those things to begin to push back. We will do our level best. It’s too risky and too important and too hard once it’s already happened.”<br />
<br />
A Labour spokesman said: “President Trump and his officials’ attempts to decide who will be Britain’s next prime minister are an entirely unacceptable interference in the UK’s democracy.” He added that the party was “fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and is implacably opposed to antisemitism in any form”.<br />
<br />
Pompeo’s comments emerged after Trump turned down Corbyn’s request for a meeting during his state visit to the UK last week, saying the leader was “somewhat of a negative force”. Corbyn joined protests outside Trump’s press conference with Theresa May, where he pledged to oppose the US president’s drive for greater access for US health companies to NHS contracts.<br />
<br />
The comments come at a time when Corbyn’s team are nervous about the latest attempts to oust him from within the party over the issues of antisemitism and Brexit, after several senior figures came out in support of a second referendum.<br />

Shadow cabinet sources said the leadership was preparing to take on Tom Watson and his supporters after his vocal campaign to soften Corbyn’s Brexit position, with moves under way to generate momentum in favour of a new deputy leadership election.<br />
<br />
There is growing talk about the possibility of the party’s rules being changed to create a second deputy leader, alongside Watson, but also the possibility of a new deputy leadership contest altogether. Some Corbyn supporters are circulating motions against Watson around local constituency Labour parties and a grassroots petition against the deputy leader has got about 26,000 signatures so far.<br />
<br />
One shadow cabinet minister said they believed the leadership wanted to make the shadow cabinet less in favour of a second referendum. As part of this, Corbyn’s team considered swapping Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, with Diane Abbott, the home secretary, over her support for a second referendum and wider foreign policy issues.<br />
<br />
However, it is understood that Thornberry has more recently been assured that she will not be moved and that Abbott was opposed to such a plan anyway, which would make the move difficult to carry out without a public battle.<br />
<br />
A Labour source said there were no plans at all for a reshuffle and dismissed speculation about moves within the top team as mischief-making.<br />
<br />
Talk of a reshuffle was sparked when Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn’s usual stand-in for prime minister’s questions this week after speaking out about Labour’s strategy for the European elections. On polling day last month, Thornberry said Labour was “not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear”. She was replaced at the dispatch box by Rebecca Long-Bailey, a rising star on the left of the party and a staunch Corbyn loyalist.

			Maker Media, the company that publishes Make Magazine and Maker Faire is laying off its staff and halting its operations amidst financial troubles, according to TechCrunch. <br />
<br />
Maker Media CEO and founder Dale Dougherty confirmed to TechCrunch that the company was ceasing operations and that it had laid off 22 employees, citing financial difficulties with publishing a magazine and the lack of corporate sponsorship. “I started this 15 years ago and it’s always been a struggle as a business to make this work,” he told TechCrunch. “Print publishing is not a great business for anybody, but it works…barely. Events are hard . . . there was a drop off in corporate sponsorship.”<br />
<br />
Launched in 2005, Maker became a major publication covering the “Maker Movement,” a culture that embraced do-it-yourself making and tinkering, involving everything from 3D printing, electronics, robotics, metal and woodworking, and other pursuits. The company launched its first Maker Faire a year later in San Mateo, California, and has since licensed the name to hundreds of exhibitions all over the world. <br />
<br />
TechCrunch notes that Dougherty is working to try and keep the company from collapsing entirely, to keep the magazine’s archives online and to license the name to future events. “I hope to be able to get control of the assets of the company and restart it. We’re not necessarily going to do everything we did in the past but I’m committed to keeping the print magazine going and the Maker Faire licensing program.”<br />
<br />
The company has faced financial trouble in recent years — it laid off 17 people in 2016, and another seven earlier this year. The company held its latest Maker Faire event last month. <br />
<br />
The collapse of the company is a huge blow to the larger making community, providing a central outlet to encourage people to learn how to build their own things, rather than just relying on companies to manufacture gadgets and products. Through its events and magazine, it provided directions, highlighted notable makers, and ideas for projects. Former Mythbusters co-host Adam Savage, who was a regular presence at the Maker Faire, said on Twitter that it was “a very sad day,” and told The Verge that “Make Media has created so many important new connections between people across the world. It showed the power from the act of creation. We are the better for its existence and I am sad. I also believe that something new will grow from what they built. The ground they laid is too fertile to lie fallow for long.”

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>When I was 12 years old, I woke to the sound of my mother crying. As I remember it, my television kept turning on. I had one in my bedroom and it kept turning on. It was surreal, whatever it was, and I don't quite remember it right. I just remember the television coming on and seeing a report of the murder in huntington beach. I was 12 years old, and that is over 25 years ago. <br />
<br />
My mother's best friend was calling her shrieking, because her oldest son, 23 had been murdered. <br />
<br />
About a month later, my brother's close friend had an older brother who died in a car accident coming home from school ( Portland University, down the 5 freeway, and one of the logging trucks smashed he and his car ).<br />
<br />
10 years later, the same friend whose brother died also deid at the age of 23 in a motorcycle accident. <br />
<br />
About 2 years after that, a friend from high school who I had always sort of kept myself connected to, because he and I were mugged together, was shot in the head over things I still do not understand. One guy jealous of another's girlfriend, weed smoking, a gun where it shouldn't have been. The agressor, the &quot;accidentor&quot; getting off with manslaughter. <br />
<br />
5 years ago, a friend from high school, the 7 foot &quot;gentle giant&quot; had his heart, literally, explode - or rupture... whatever you want to call it. <br />
<br />
3 years ago, an old friend of mine commited suicide over a heart break. <br />
<br />
now today, a friend connected with several of those above, with some just as acquaintances, I learned died of over dose. His body was found beween two bushes on a busy street in Hemet. I hadn't talked to him much in 10 years. <br />
<br />
All of the above. These were all young people. All people that while I lost communication with. It feels like the moment I stopped thinking of them, they were permanently gone. People find it fucking strange that I stay in contact with so many fucking people. <br />
<br />
It is like, as soon as I stop thinking about them for just a second, they fucking die. In fucked up ways. <br />
<br />
I'm getting fucking tired of this shit.</div>

The biggest game of the month is unquestionably <b>Super Mario Maker 2</b>. The first game became an instant classic on a console almost no one owned. If they can make up for the loss of the TV+tablet dynamic, I see no reason why a Switch version won't be even bigger. For those unaware, Mario Maker is an easy to use toolkit that lets you create and share your own Mario levels. You can get as crazy as you want, and some of the previous game's creations were brilliant. <br />
<br />
The PS4 is also getting an exclusive from the team that made the Yakuza games, <b>Judgement</b>. Same universe, different story and different gameplay. You play a disgraced lawyer turned detective, trying to solve a mysterious case of serial murders. I think this looks very promising, but I worry it will struggle to even maintain niche status. The name is bland, there is little branding or marketing power. It's only hope is to be discovered the same way stuff like Nier was: overwhelming word of mouth.<br />
<br />
We've also got a high profile indie release this month: the long awaited <b>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</b>. This was a Kickstarter game by Koji Igarashi, known for working on the Castlevania series, after he left Konami. It's designed in the same style, and has been eagerly anticipated by fans of the genre. While in the process of creating this game they released an 8-bit style in the same universe that was very well regarded, so I'm not too worried about this one.<br />
<br />
We've also got a couple returns/remakes of classic franchises. If you like fighting games, look forward to <b>Samurai Shodown</b>. I feel like even with fighting game fans this one was kind of niche and hard to find, but it's pretty highly regarded by people who did play it. If you like kart racers, you've got <b>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</b> to look forward to instead. I don't know anything about this game (other than genre and cast, obviously) but it's got some pretty die hard fans that insist this is a big deal.<br />
<br />
Finally, the 3DS is getting yet another major game release, <b>Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth</b>. Persona Q is a spinoff of the Persona series by merging Persona characters, themes, enemies, etc with Etrian Odyssey gameplay. EO being a classic dungeon crawler series also published by Atlus, known for harsh difficulty and a system in which you map out floors manually as you explore. The previous game included the cast from Persona 3 and Persona 4, and this one is adding the cast of Persona 5. <br />
<br />
Edit: Oh heck, I forgot one. <b>The Sunken City</b>. I have no idea if this is going to be good enough to be worth mentioning, but I think the premise is something some of you might find interesting. It's basically a Lovecraft horror game heavily focusing on investigation/mystery and featuring a sanity resource. This game could eat Judgement's lunch if it's good. I'm a little nervous about performance.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It's that time of the year again. Starting the thread a little early. E3 this year runs from June 9-13. EA as usual has their own event a few days before E3 itself. This year is going to be a little weird. <br />
<br />
For the first time, I think ever, Sony will not be attending. Square Enix is taking their press conference time slot. EA itself continues to have its own event, but this time they are not having a press conference. They may still announce a few things, but will largely be streaming games over the weekend instead. There is also going to be an UploadVR press conference this year, apparently.<br />
<br />
Microsoft and Bethesda on Sunday. Ubisoft and Square Enix on Monday. Nintendo on Tuesday. Additionally, Upload VR joins the PC Gaming Show early Monday.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It sort of feels like E3 is having a crisis of identity at the moment, like it could tear at the seams at any moment. I think I'm still excited, and at the very least it will help solidify the release schedule for the rest of the year. Below are a few of my expectations for this year's E3. I still think it has the potential to be a good one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Sony:</b> Not much to say here. The guy in charge hates E3 and they will not be attending. I do think they might announce a few things on the periphery (Death Stranding got a release date trailer, for example) but I'm not quite sure if I should expect anything else. Previously I thought they would drop a few bombs just to disrupt things, but now I'm not so sure. They will probably want to just wait until a time when all the attention will be on them.<br />
<br />
<b>Microsoft:</b> I expect them to go big this year. They've said that they intend to make up the difference in Sony not being there. This isn't just about exclusives anymore, as major third party games that were previously divvied between the two of them are completely up for grabs now. I also think there is a fair chance they will finally show something concrete with their next platform (whether it's hardware or streaming service), as well as some of the games their new studios are creating. They've teased Halo Infinite, now I would like to see it. I expect a 2020 release for both. Gears 5 should get a release date for later this year.<br />
<br />
<b>Nintendo</b>: I feel like Nintendo has a fairly stable collection of known quantities this year, and less fog obscuring what they might show. While the newest Metroid Prime has been sent back to the drawing board, they still have a major new Pokemon release this year, as well as Animal Crossing and Bayonetta 3, neither of which we have actually seen yet. We will also probably see more Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Link's Awakening, and Luigi's Mansion 3. They have so many confirmed games in development, that I wonder if there is even room for a surprise, though I would still like one.<br />
<br />
<b>EA:</b> We already sort of know what they will show. Their big game this year is Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order. I'm sure they will also show more Apex Legends, Fifa, etc. Their other big game this year, Anthem, is sort of on fire. I assumed they would be talking about continued support, but it's apparently not on the streaming schedule. I wouldn't be surprised if the Sims 5 gets announced soon, but other than that I've got nothing.<br />
<br />
<b>Ubisoft:</b> Ubisoft always &quot;wins&quot; E3, and yet each year I'm always skeptical. What more could they really have to show? Chances are good they will talk up Division 2 support, have another wacky Just Dance routine, and surprise us with at least one new thing. I've heard rumors of both a new Assassin's Creed and a new Watchdogs, but I'm not sure which will be present. I'm also pretty curious if they will have another weird Nintendo crossover. We might see Beyond Good and Evil 2 gameplay, but I'm skeptical.<br />
<br />
<b>Bethesda:</b> Half of Bethesda's press conference this year will consist of Todd Howard on fire, rolling on the floor and apologizing for Fallout 76. Just kidding. I am curious if they will dare mention Fallout 76 at all though. I sort of feel like they are more likely to continue to support a failing game than EA or Activision. What else could they show? Doom Eternal and Wolfenstein YoungBlood are shoe ins. Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 have been confirmed to <b>not</b> appear. Shame on Starfield. I'm not sure what their big game this year is without it.<br />
<br />
<b>Square Enix:</b> Their show last year was kind of... bad. They are taking Sony's time slot this year. This feels presumptuous to me. Like they really need to go above and beyond to justify it. Ignoring how good their presentation itself is, what can they show? I think their big game is going to be Final Fantasy 7. They've already teased it. It's time for us to see something that isn't the reactor mission. It's time for a release date. 2019 or bust suckers. They've got to show more than that though, and I'm not sure what else they've got. Tomb Raider and Deus Ex are on ice. They are rumored to have a big Avengers game in the works though.<br />
<br />
<b>PC Gaming Show:</b> I never know what to expect from this. All I really want to say is that it is sponsored by Epic Games this year, which amuses me greatly. More specifically, how angry this has made people amuses me. Epic is being extremely aggressive with the launch of their Steam competitor client/store. They brought the console wars to PC, and are now sponsoring the PC gaming show at E3. I'm mostly expecting a lot of announcements that make people mad, and maybe a few free games.<br />
<br />
<br />
Odds and Ends:<br />
<br />
Upon the conclusion of Game of Thrones, people have been pestering GRRM. Somehow as part of this, he has let it slip that he has done consultation work with a major Japanese developer. I've heard rumors that this might be From Software's next game, but I don't know how substantial they are. <br />
<br />
The next Watchdogs is rumored to take place in London. The next Assassin's Creed is rumored to involve vikings.<br />
<br />
Cyberpunk 2077 is confirmed to be there. Dying Light 2 is confirmed to be there. I want to see Dragon Age 4, but I find it incredibly unlikely. <br />
<br />
Is there anything in particular any of you want to see and/or hear about this year?</div>
