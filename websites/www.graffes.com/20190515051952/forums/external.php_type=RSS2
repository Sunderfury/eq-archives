			Bille Nye deviated from his kid-friendly &quot;Science Guy&quot; persona on Sunday night to help John Oliver talk about the severity of climate change. Nye proved he's not always the mild-mannered nerd millennials grew up with when he joined Oliver during his episode detailing carbon pricing and the Green New Deal.<br />
<br />
Oliver first outlined the case for the Green New Deal, the environment and jobs proposal introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. &quot;To its eternal credit, the Green New Deal has succeeded in getting people talking, but that won't mean anything unless that talk turns into action,&quot; Oliver said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to need a lot of different policies working tandem, and we have to take action right now,&quot; the comedian said, towards the end of the segment. &quot;But you don't have to just take that from me. Instead, I'm happy to say Bill Nye has actually agreed to drive the urgency home at this point by actually doing one of his enjoyable, lighthearted demonstrations.&quot;<br />
<br />

<iframe class="restrain" title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JDcro7dPqpA?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<br />
<br />
After the tongue-in-cheek introduction, Nye gave a demonstration that was much less lighthearted — and used much stronger language — than usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the end of this century, if temperatures keep rising, the average temperature on earth could go up another 4 to 8 degrees,&quot; Nye said. &quot;What I'm saying is, the planet's on f****ing fire.&quot; The Science Guy then took a blowtorch to a globe, setting it ablaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are several options to put out the proverbial fire on Earth,&quot; Nye explains. &quot;Are any of them free? No, of course not, you idiots. Grow the f*** up. You're adults now.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the globe burns, he declares: &quot;I didn't mind explaining photosynthesis to you when you were 12, but you're adults now. This is an actual crisis, got it?&quot; Nye's expletive-laden rant was received with laughter from the audience. Oliver ends the episode by joking that he's &quot;absolutely on board&quot; with Nye's &quot;gritty reboot.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tough-talking version of Nye gained widespread attention online and he quickly became a trending topic on Twitter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill Nye is not the one we used to know! He means business,&quot; one person tweeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;A VERY important, VERY science-forward message from Bill Nye: 'The planet is on f*ck!ng fire.' Needless to say, Bill understands how dire it is that we turn things around for our planet. It's the only one we've got!&quot; another person wrote. Several jokingly posted &quot;Bill Nye 2020.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not only did Oliver memorably drive home his point about climate change and the Green New Deal, but he also proved that one way to get through to millennials is work with the same Science Guy who got them interested in the world of science when they were kids.<br />

			A San Francisco journalist said Sunday authorities knocked down the gate of his home with a sledgehammer, handcuffed him for hours and seized thousands of dollars in electronics after he refused to identify a confidential source.<br />
<br />
The journalist, Bryan Carmody, said in an interview that the raid occurred Friday — though officers from the San Francisco Police Department first asked him two weeks ago about who provided a police report that revealed details of the death of the city’s longtime public defender, Jeff Adachi, in February.<br />
<br />
The city’s medical examiner determined that trace amounts of cocaine and alcohol found in Adachi’s system contributed to a heart attack that killed him.<br />
<br />
Carmody, a 49-year-old freelancer, said he sold the leaked story — which included photos from the apartment where Adachi was found unresponsive — to some local news outlets. After the leak was denounced by elected officials and Adachi’s widow, who called it “despicable,” a department commander apologized and said the leaker would be held accountable.<br />
<br />
When the officers arrived at Carmody’s home, he said, “They asked me to give them the source. Of course I declined.”<br />
<br />
When authorities returned on Friday, Carmody said officers had a warrant that appeared to say they were looking for the report, which was described as “stolen or embezzled” property.<br />
<br />
Carmody said he was handcuffed for seven hours while officers took his equipment and obtained another warrant to search his office.<br />
<br />
“They took every electronic device that I own — every computer, every hard drive, every digital photograph that I have taken in the last 25 years,” he said.<br />
<br />
They also took the report, though Carmody said the document did not specify the source who provided it to him.<br />
<br />
The San Francisco Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but it provided a statement Friday to NBC Bay Area.<br />
<br />
“Today’s actions are one step in the process of investigating a potential case of obstruction of justice along with the illegal distribution of a confidential police report,&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
The local chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists condemned the raid, saying it “shows an alarming disregard for the right to gather and report on information.” The group said it was seeking more information on why the department did not follow California’s shield laws, which protects journalists who refuse to disclose a source’s identity.<br />
<br />
Carmody said he’s had a good working relationship with the police department for years. Now, he just wants his equipment back.<br />
<br />
“At this point, they’ve shut down my business completely,” he said. “I don’t have the gear I need to do my job.”

<br />

			Newly leaked documents have fueled two new reports over the weekend of allegations of irresponsible and potentially legally dubious spending by the National Rifle Association. The reports have also given further insight into the ugly infighting in the NRA leadership and into the precarious situation the organization has found itself in as it faces an investigation into possible financial wrongdoing. <br />
<br />
On Saturday, the Daily Beast reported that an anonymously leaked document appeared to show allegations by former NRA president Oliver North that the group was facing an “existential threat” in the form of legal bills. In the leaked confidential April memo dating to the week before he was dramatically ousted as president, North wrote that the NRA was being billed nearly $100,000 a day. North then pleaded for an audit of their payments to outside attorney Bill Brewer. <br />
<br />
As North contended, the fees could doom the NRA financially. Over the past year the organization had paid Brewer $18.5 million, he noted. North said he had appealed to CEO Wayne LaPierre directly to have an independent review of the law firm’s invoices, but LaPierre denied his requests. He also suggested that the NRA didn’t properly manage the law firm’s work. <br />
<br />
NRA management told the Daily Beast that the allegations were inaccurate and suggested the leak was part of a smear campaign targeting LaPierre. (North, best known for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, was pushed out as president when LaPierre accused North of trying to use allegations of financial impropriety to extort him into resigning.) “It is troubling and a bit pathetic that some people would resort to leaking information to advance their agendas,” the new president, Carolyn Meadows, said in a statement. <br />
<br />
Separately on Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported on leaked documents—also from letters North sent to the organization’s board last month—that appeared to show that the advertising firm Ackerman McQueen helped pay for luxurious clothing and travel for LaPierre. According to the anonymously posted documents, LaPierre billed $39,000 for just one day of shopping at a clothing boutique at Beverly Hills. On another line, he charged $18,300 for a car and driver in Europe, and in another, $13,800 for a summer intern’s rent. The firm tallied up more than $542,000 in clothes, travel, and other expenses, much of which went into flights. North suggested the costs meant “financial impropriety” by LaPierre. The NRA has said the expenditures were justifiable for LaPierre’s work and public appearances. <br />
<br />
Last month, the NRA sued Ackerman McQueen for documents about its expenses, accusing it of failing to justify its billing. According to that lawsuit, North withheld information about his relationship with the firm. <br />
<br />
The problem with the allegations has to do with the NRA’s status as a nonprofit. As the New Yorker reported last month when it looked into financial improprieties at the organization, it’s possible the group has violated New York state’s laws for nonprofits, which are meant to operate their finances with the best interest of their organization in mind and not for the benefit of any executives or board members. <br />
<br />
New York Attorney General Letitia James has opened an investigation into the NRA’s finances and tax-exempt status. The NRA is chartered in New York, and James has the authority to punish the organization if she finds wrongdoing by forcing it to repay money or even dissolve the organization itself, though the latter is highly unlikely. The IRS is also investigating the NRA and may remove its tax exempt status as a nonprofit—a move that would dramatically undercut its ability to solicit money from wealthy donors. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the NRA is also facing scrutiny over the case of Maria Butina, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for serving as a foreign agent. She was accused of attempting to infiltrate the NRA, and it was revealed she had befriended NRA officials and put them in contact with Kremlin officials. The NRA has turned over a number of documents to the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the committee has not yet released its findings in the investigation.

<br />
Episode 6 was so god damn funny, it got about 10 minutes of solid laugh out loud belts from me, followed by another 10 minutes of laugh out loud belts. If I was drinking something, I would have spat several times, it was so good.<br />
<br />
Ridiculously dark on the level of &quot;Happy&quot; with Christopher Meloni, but the demure is always so present, that episode 6 was that much more shocking. <br />
<br />
If you haven't watched it, make sure you watch it all. The contrast is neceasary.</div>

Square Enix actually had another studio working on this, but for one reason or another they scrapped the project and started over from scratch. That's why we haven't heard from this in so long.<br />
<br />
Lately Sony has started doing internet streamed presentations similar to Nintendo Direct, called State of Play. Microsoft has had one of these for awhile now as well. Well at the most recent State of Play, Square Enix finally showed FF7R again. Could we finally be close to seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, or do we have another 10 year long SE project again.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So sometimes for a limited time a company will give away free copies of a game. Sometimes its a gesture of good will for an old game, sometimes its a promotion to get you to use their service.<br />
<br />
When this happens, I or someone else will often make a new thread for it, so that people that might be interested can pick it up. Though sometimes I put it in the monthly release thread instead, or whatever seems appropriate. I've been wondering lately if it would be more efficient to have a single thread to post these in.<br />
<br />
So that's what this poll is about. Would you rather this information be gathered in a single source, or is a universal thread too much trouble to keep checking in on? Would you rather have more empty threads but with titles that let you know for sure whether you are interested or not?</div>

I have been having a really bad quarter so far. First My father in law has been in and out of the hospital(2 months) with stomach bleeding. First caused by a ruptured Ulcer and further bleeding of a unknown source. This had wreaked havoc on my Wife and Mother-in-law.Since In-laws also watch our children also caused lots of issues with having to take time off from each of our jobs. Then a few weeks ago my daughter was mauled by a neighbors dog (could have been worse, but bad enough) at my Mother in laws house. (can't give details due to it being an open case). Then partly as step of recovery for my daughter and my wife's want. I finally gave in got a purebred basset puppy(yes, from CL). Which in 16 hours showed symptoms of sickness and 22 hours was diagnosed with parvo and died 3 days later after receiving intensive care. It seems I have some serious bad mojo hanging around and would like help getting rid of it. <br />
<br />
I have a go fund me to try to get a new basset this time from a reputable breeder( they are like $1200), Right now I'm totally drained with the first dog $350 for the dog and $300 for the vet. but that is optional if you want to share it or participate , really just need to get rid of this bad mojo.  <br />

			When Netflix's 13 Reasons Why was released two years ago, depicting the life of a teenager who decided to take her own life, educators and psychologists warned the program could lead to copycat suicides. Now, a study funded by the National Institutes of Health shows that those concerns may have been warranted.<br />
<br />
In the month following the show's debut in March 2017, there was a 28.9% increase in suicide among Americans ages 10-17, said the study, published Monday in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. The number of suicides was greater than that seen in any single month over the five-year period researchers examined. Over the rest of the year, there were 195 more youth suicides than expected given historical trends. <br />
<br />
Researchers warn that their study could not prove causation. Some unknown third factor might have been responsible for the increase, they said. Still, citing the strong correlation, they cautioned against exposing children and adolescents to the series.<br />
<br />
&quot;The results of this study should raise awareness that young people are particularly vulnerable to the media,&quot; study co-author Lisa Horowitz, a staff scientist at the National Institute of Mental Health, said in a statement. &quot;All disciplines, including the media, need to take good care to be constructive and thoughtful about topics that intersect with public health crises.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lead author Jeff Bridge, a suicide researcher at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, told The Associated Press that an additional analysis found the April suicide rate was higher than in the previous 19 years. &quot;The creators of the series intentionally portrayed the suicide of the main character. It was a very graphic depiction of the suicide death,&quot; he said, which can lead to suicidal behavior.<br />
<br />
The study found that boys were far more likely than girls to kill themselves after the show debuted. Suicide rates for females did increase, but it was not statistically significant. Nor were there any &quot;significant trends&quot; in suicide rates for people 18-64, researchers said.<br />
<br />
In a statement, a Netflix spokesperson said they had &quot;just seen this study and are looking into the research. &quot;This is a critically important topic and we have worked hard to ensure that we handle this sensitive issue responsibly,&quot; Netflix said, according to The Associated Press.<br />
<br />
The spokesperson noted that the study conflicts with research published last week out of the University of Pennsylvania. That study found that young adults, ages 18-29, who watched the entire second season of the show &quot;reported declines in suicide ideation and self-harm relative to those who did not watch the show at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, that study found, viewers who stopped watching the second season before the end &quot;exhibited greater suicide risk and less optimism about the future than those who continued to the end.&quot; The results &quot;suggest that a fictional story with a focus on suicidal content can have both harmful and helpful effects,&quot; the authors wrote.<br />
<br />
When the show debuted, the National Association of School Psychologists issued a warning statement: &quot;We do not recommend that vulnerable youth, especially those who have any degree of suicidal ideation, watch this series. Its powerful storytelling may lead impressionable viewers to romanticize the choices made by the characters and/or develop revenge fantasies,&quot; they said. &quot;Suicide is not a solution to problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the criticism, Netflix added a &quot;viewer warning card&quot; before the first episode. Netflix also added language publicizing the website 13reasonswhy.info, which offers resources for people contemplating suicide. Season 3 of the show is expected to be released this year.<br />

			Khalid al-Baidhani found out early about the risks of being an Iraqi working for the U.S. military in Baghdad. In 2006, he was waiting for a ride home outside a U.S. base.<br />
<br />
&quot;A car stopped right away, took out the pistol and start shooting me,&quot; Baidhani recalls, &quot;I [couldn't] feel anything after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Baidhani survived, recovered and went back to work with U.S. forces.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want ... good communications between U.S. military and Iraqi civilians over there,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
His uncle also volunteered. So did his brother Wisam, who worked with Peter Farley, a former Army sergeant from Massachusetts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn't imagine in a million years that I'd go over there and come back with one of my best friends being an Iraqi national,&quot; Farley told NPR.<br />
<br />
In light of the sacrifice made by Iraqis and Afghans who assisted U.S. forces, Congress created the Special Immigrant Visa program to get them and their families to safety in the U.S. Farley says it was about gratitude and also an incentive for local nationals to help U.S. troops. Now veterans such as Farley, as well as dozens of lawmakers, say they're afraid the promise they made is being broken. Under the Trump administration, the number coming to the U.S. has dropped drastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;This administration is hostile to refugees,&quot; says Adam Bates, with the International Refugee Assistance Project. <br />
<br />
Bates says in Iraq the program has a backlog of more than 100,000 people. Last year about 200 were cleared — down from nearly 10,000 in 2016. <br />
<br />
The number of Afghans getting visas also is slowing — down about 60% in recent years, Bates says. More than 4,000 were cleared in fiscal year 2017, compared with about 1,650 in 2018. <br />
<br />
&quot;It would be impossible to say that these substantial drops are not a part of some policy. These are people who put themselves at risk because they served with U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
A U.S. State Department official told NPR that it is working closely with U.S government partners to accelerate the visa processing, while maintaining national security as a highest priority. In response to a bipartisan letter from Congress, the Department of Homeland Security said it was aiming to speed up the visas after recent changes in the program, also with security as an overarching concern.<br />
<br />
None of that makes sense to Farley, who says that if the Baidhani family was a threat to Americans, they could have killed him any number of times in Iraq.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, this family has sacrificed more than most American families,&quot; Farley says.<br />
<br />
He lobbied the U.S. government to get both Baidhani and his brother, Wisam, to the U.S. in 2011. They've been living and working here ever since. But the program came too late for Khalid's uncle — gunmen killed him in 2008, on his way home from an American base. <br />
<br />
Baidhani's father and younger siblings also qualified for visas, but they're stuck in Baghdad. <br />
<br />
&quot;We worry about this family every day,&quot; Farley says. Wisam declined to be interviewed, he says because he has become depressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's hard to keep hope with the way things have gone,&quot; Farley says.<br />
<br />
The way things have gone is that the family is still in Baghdad. After years of waiting and red tape, Baidhani's father, stepmother and three younger siblings were granted U.S. visas in 2016. They sold their family home in Baghdad, and all their other assets, and packed their bags. The day before their flight, they got a call that the visas had been put on hold pending yet another security check.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was shocked. It was like someone shot me with a bullet. I collapsed,&quot; Mohammad, Khalid and Wisam's father, told NPR.<br />
<br />
He's now crowded into a rundown rented house with his eldest daughter and her husband — two bedrooms for the seven of them, trapped in a tough neighborhood in Baghdad. The family has no idea when they might get permission to travel.<br />
<br />
Khalid's younger brother, Ahmed, is now 23. He quit his job when he thought he was leaving in 2016 and hasn't had steady work since then.<br />
<br />
&quot;We sacrifice a lot — my brother shot twice,&quot; he says. &quot;Why us? Security check after security check. I just want to ask them to see us as a family who actually wants to serve the country,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Farley — like many other vets who promised their interpreters safety in the U.S. — says he's angry that his promise has been broken. And he thinks that's a national security issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was in their shoes, and I learned about the stories of the U.S. not offering protection to people that stepped up and fought alongside their soldiers — or to their families of those heroes,&quot; Farley asks, &quot;Why would I ever sign up to do that for the U.S.?&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I finally watched this last night, and really enjoyed it.  Costner and Harrelson work well together as two retired Texas Rangers in 1934 who hunt down Bonnie &amp; Clyde, and it's interesting to see it from the perspective of the law rather than Bonnie &amp; Clyde, although I did love the movie with Dunaway and Beatty.  Bonnie &amp; Clyde are only shown briefly throughout the movie, and only speak a couple of times, so definitely not focused on them.  I think many of you would enjoy it.</div>
