<br />
I started in May.<br />
<br />
He's been a generally yell-tacular asshat since he started into the position and I've had to ask HR about how to address the fact that even clients I am on the phone with are commenting on the noise, but since he's kinda screamy, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to live up to his wishes.<br />
<br />
I could use any positive thoughts/prayers/etc.<br />
<br />
I've never even gotten a verbal warning, but dude recently quit smoking and is an angry flufferducker.<br />
<br />
I walk in every day thinking I'm going to get canned, so I guess this is the test of that.<br />
<br />
At-will states can manufacture any reason, as long as they have one. Not adhering to the corporate dress code by wearing incorrectly colored socks works, if they wrote it into the terminable options.</div>

			The Internet is awash with covert crypto currency miners that bog down computers and even smartphones with computationally intensive math problems called by hacked or ethically questionable sites.<br />
<br />
The latest examples came on Monday with the revelation from antivirus provider Trend Micro that at least two Android apps with as many as 50,000 downloads from Google Play were recently caught putting crypto miners inside a hidden browser window. The miners caused phones running the apps to run JavaScript hosted on Coinhive.com, a site that harnesses the CPUs of millions of PCs to mine the Monero crypto currency. In turn, Coinhive gives participating sites a tiny cut of the relatively small proceeds. Google has since removed the apps, which were known as Recitiamo Santo Rosario Free and SafetyNet Wireless App.<br />
<br />
Last week, researchers from security firm Sucuri warned that at least 500 websites running the WordPress content management system alone had been hacked to run the Coinhive mining scripts. Sucuri said other Web platforms—including Magento, Joomla, and Drupal—are also being hacked in large numbers to run the Coinhive programming interface.<br />
<br />
Earlier this month, political fact-checking site Politifact.com was found hosting Coinhive scripts in a way that exhausted 100 percent of visitors computing resources. A PolitiFact official told Ars the incident occurred when &quot;an unidentified hacker attached a crypto mining script to the PolitiFact code base being stored on a cloud-based server.&quot; The code has since been removed and was active only when people had a politifact.com window open in their browser.<br />
<br />
<b>Don't look, don't tell</b><br />
<br />
Coinhive presents its service as a way end users can support sites without viewing online ads, which are often criticized for containing malware that surreptitiously infects visitors with ransomware, password stealers, and other malicious wares. And in fairness, the service only consumes 100 percent of a visitor's computing resources when the Coinhive's interfaces are being abused. Still, Coinhive doesn't require third-party sites to tell visitors their computers and electricity are being consumed in exchange for visiting the site. Coinhive has also done nothing to prevent sites from abusing its programming interface in a way that completely drains visitors' resources.<br />
<br />
Ad blocker AdGuard recently reported that 220 sites on the Alexa top 100,000 list serve crypto mining scripts to more than 500 million people. In three weeks, AdGuard estimated, the sites generated a collective $43,000. Both AdGuard, antimalware provider Malwarebytes, and a variety of their peers have recently started blocking or restricting access to Coinhive crypto mining. Both AdGuard and Malwarebytes give end users who want to support a site using Coinhive the option of accessing the mining script. In announcing the move, Malwarebytes wrote:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			The reason we block Coinhive is because there are site owners who do not ask for their users' permission to start running CPU-gorging applications on their systems. A regular Bitcoin miner could be incredibly simple or a powerhouse, depending on how much computing the user running the miner wants to use. The JavaScript version of a miner allows customization of how much mining to do, per user system, but leaves that up to the site owner, who may want to slow down your computer experience to a crawl.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Coinhive's massive Web audience isn't lost on other companies. Collin Mulliner, a security researcher and developer of TelStop, said he recently received an e-mail from a startup called Medsweb inviting him to integrate a Monero miner into his creation. &quot;If your app is deployed on thousands/millions of devices, you can monetize it with monero mining and earn really huge income,&quot; the unsolicited e-mail stated. &quot;We manage all the complexity of backend servers and mining operations and you get a really simple control panel to monitor your hashrate and earnings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes noted that Coinhive recently introduced authedmine.com, a service that requires third-party sites received explicit permission of end users before using their computers to mine digital coins. But the antimalware provider went on to point out that coinhive.com remains active and continues to require no end-user notice at all. As the recent discovery of the Android apps and the more than 500 hacked websites makes clear, Coinhive continues to turn a blind eye to the abuse of its service in much the way adware providers did in the early 2000s.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>First of all, good morning, you piles of pigshit.  Now that the salutations are out of the way, let me get down to my point:  Your stupid ideas won't work.  The people you're targeting are ordinary people, pawns.  The poor souls victimized yesterday were mostly visiting tourists from the Southern Hemisphere, and were not your enemies before, but their relatives and countrymen for sure don't like ISIS now, that's certain.<br />
 <br />
No, your dipshit ideas won't work because the people you're actually mad at, the ones who made the decisions that fucked up whatever you think got fucked up of yours, aren't riding bikes in the Park, nor are they in the crowd at music festivals, nor are they just getting to work at eight in the morning in a Trade Authority rental suite.<br />
 <br />
Like every other moron asshole coward sons of bitches, you went after soft targets because they were easy to get at, even though they had zero influence over our policy, and are considered disposable cogs by the very people you're actually pissed off at.  All you did was to sweep a few low-value pieces off some remote corner of the board, which, as you ought to know, any King or Queen would gladly sacrifice again and again to gain even the tiniest advantage for themselves.<br />
 <br />
Congratulations, you fools, you're succeeded in making yourselves universally hated forever.  No one will ever think of your kind as &quot;noble Partisans&quot; ever again, thanks to your laziness and your stinking fear of failure.  No one, including our own odious Elites has ever fucked your own causes as thoroughly as you have fucked them yourselves through your inhuman actions.<br />
 <br />
In conclusion, go fuck yourselves with a rusty exhaust pipe.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This is it. November is the last big month of the year for new releases. While October is overwhelming in quantity, that's largely because historically November is the month of juggernauts no one wants to compete with. This has traditionally meant Call of Duty, but they have had gradually increased competition from EA over the past couple of years.<br />
<br />
Of the two heavyweights this month, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I think <b>Star Wars Battlefront 2</b> is going to be the overall winner. The previous game was a massive success despite being anemic in content and kind of bland overall. With that success they have the opportunity to massively improve what they created before. They also acknowledged fan demands and created a single player campaign, making it attractive even to people who do not want to play multiplayer.<br />
<br />
The other big contender this month is obviously <b>Call of Duty: WW2</b>. Call of Duty has been huge for awhile now but their star has been waning. When you release a new game every year it can be kind of hard to stay fresh, and they have gradually shifted their focus more and more into science fiction. Call it what you will, a return to form or a last ditch act of desperation, but Call of Duty is now going back to World War 2. They are leaning on this <i>hard</i>, complete with advertisements about thirty-somethings who have moved on in their lives &quot;getting the band back together&quot;. Will it be enough? <br />
<br />
<br />
The only other game this month that really compares to the above two in popularity is <b>Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</b> for the 3DS. Rather than an all new game, this is following Pokemon tradition by expanding the previously released game in a series with new features, pokemon, story, etc. Recycled content or not, people still gobble these up.<br />
<br />
Also worth mentioning this month are <b>Sonic Forces</b>, <b>Need for Speed Payback</b>, and <b>Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2</b>. The last two are fairly self-explanatory, and the only thing I really find worth pointing out about the new Sonic game is that this is the one where you can create your own Sonic character.<br />
<br />
The Switch is getting a ton of ports this month. The most notable being <b>Doom</b> and <b>Skyrim</b>, the PS4 and Vita are sharing another jrpg dungeon crawler in <b>Demon Gaze II</b>, and the PC is getting a port of <b>Nioh</b>, the Japanese themed Dark Soulsy game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, this month Microsoft releases their <b>Xbox One X</b>. This is Microsoft's answer to all the 900p talk for the past several years when the PS4 was the most powerful console. That is no longer true, and in true Microsoft fashion they let you know by repeating the same buzz words over and over. Power power power power power power power power. :D<br />
<br />
I will be curious to see how this does for them. Sony users will no longer be able to make fun of their performance, but it's also really expensive and Sony has been using their lead to create a kind of insane portfolio of games.<br />

			WASHINGTON — Two top Trump administration officials told Congress on Monday that they opposed rewriting a 16-year-old law that the government has cited to justify military operations against Islamist militants, including Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, saying the existing statute was sufficient.<br />
<br />
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson also warned that if lawmakers did replace the law, known as the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F., they should not impose any time or geographic constraints on the government’s war powers.<br />
<br />
But the ranking Democrat on the panel, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, said the 9/11 war authorization law — along with another military force authorization that Congress enacted in 2002 to pave the way for the Iraq war — “have now become mere authorities of convenience for presidents to conduct military activities anywhere in the world.”<br />
<br />
While protecting Americans from terrorism was important, he added, “I think there needs to be more public discussion and light on these activities because I do not think the American people want the United States conducting a global, endless shadow war under the radar, covert and beyond scrutiny.”<br />
<br />
Congress has been wrestling for years about whether and how to update the war authorization law. On its face, the statute permits using force only against those responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But three presidents, from both major parties, have stretched it to cover enemies beyond the original Al Qaeda and its Taliban host in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
And broader questions about the legal scope and limits of presidential warmaking powers have taken on new urgency in the Trump era, including because of tensions with North Korea over its testing of nuclear weapons and longer-range missiles and the deaths of four American soldiers this month in Niger.<br />
<br />
Questioned about North Korea on Monday, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis acknowledged that Congress had not granted any authority to Mr. Trump to start a war. Still, they said, he possessed constitutional authority as commander in chief to strike North Korea in the event of an imminent attack against the United States.<br />
<br />
But Mr. Tillerson demurred when pressed to say whether North Korea’s mere possession of a nuclear weapon that could reach the United States would be sufficient to enable Mr. Trump to strike on his own. Mr. Tillerson said such questions could turn on the facts, including whether such a weapon was stored in a bunker or was sitting on a launching pad.<br />
<br />
Several senators also pressed the witnesses about the recent deaths in Niger. Although Mr. Mattis said the purpose of the deployment there was to help build up national defenses because “the enemy is trying to move somewhere” as the Islamic State’s stronghold in Iraq and Syria collapsed, he said it was authorized under a separate law that allowed the military to carry out training and assistance missions.<br />
<br />
Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, suggested that what the military billed as a mere training mission looked to some as if it was “actually putting American troops out in harm’s way,” helping local partners conduct dangerous missions. But Mr. Mattis said American troops had previously gone on many training patrols in that area without encountering hostile fire.<br />
<br />
Mr. Mattis also noted that another Islamist militant group in the region, Boko Haram, had pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda — meaning Mr. Trump could deem them covered by the 2001 war authorization law. But that has not happened, Mr. Mattis said.<br />
<br />
The insistence by Trump administration officials that any replacement war authorization law contained no new limits led to recurring discussion. Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, noted that he had introduced a new A.U.M.F. bill that met that criteria, and under questioning by Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, Mr. Mattis emphasized his rationale.<br />
<br />
“People run on hope,” Mr. Mattis said. “And if the enemy hopes we are going to quit on a certain day, and if they know we won’t deal with them if they step over a certain border, then the enemy’s going to do exactly that.”<br />
<br />
But Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, argued that Congress should revisit the war law from time to time. He has sponsored a bill with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that would replace the law with one that better reflects its current use, but that would expire after five years if Congress does not vote to reauthorize it.<br />
<br />
“I would argue that the concern about giving our adversaries notice that we have to vote on something may be an issue,” Mr. Flake said, “but it’s overwhelmed in a big way by not having Congress buy in and not having us having skin in the game.”

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I keep forgetting this is a thing. Supposedly Sony moved most of their big announcements from their yearly PSX show in December to this instead. I'm not going to do an entire write up like I do with E3, but there were still a few things worth making a thread over.<br />
<br />
For starters, they announced seven or eight new games, but the three that I would say are the biggest deals are Guacamelee 2, Spelunky 2, and Ghost of Tsushima. The first two are sequels to indie darlings that were very highly regarded, the latter is the new game from Sucker Punch. Sucker Punch is probably best known for making the Infamous games. All we really know about Ghost of Tsushima right now is that it is a samurai game and probably takes place during the Mongol Invasion of Japan.<br />
<br />
They also had a bunch of updated trailers for games I didn't expect to hear from again for awhile, including Spider Man, God of War, Detroit Become Human, Monster Hunter, and The Last of Us Part 2. It's probably going to be impossible to not have the nature of this latter trailer spoiled to you, but I want to make it clear that if you are going to attempt a media blackout to start it now. This trailer is fairly significant in ways I will describe in a spoiler tag below. It is not a secret, it is not a spoiler, but whether or not you want to see it now or later is up to you.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>The Last of Us Part 2</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
Unless there are multiple playable characters, Ellie is not the protagonist of the sequel. This trailer actually introduces several new characters, and they make it fairly obvious that one is the new protagonist and one is probably going to be the new sidekick character. Naughty Dog games tend to have story sequences that pan seamlessly into third person perspective just before gameplay starts, and they employ that trick in this trailer.<br />
<br />
There is also the fact that the imagery of this trailer pairs nicely with previously released promotional material that was vague up before now. A poster with an arm holding a hammer. <br />

			A 12-year-old boy who police said jumped off a highway overpass in an attempted suicide took the life of a young woman instead. <br />
<br />
Marisa Harris, 22, was headed eastbound on Interstate 66 near the Cedar Lane overpass at around 4:15 p.m. when the boy came crashing down onto her 2005 Ford Explorer, Virginia State Police said in a statement. Harris was killed but her 23-year-old passenger and the 12-year-old boy both survived. The incident is being investigated as an attempted suicide, according to police. <br />
<br />
&quot;Based on the investigation and witness accounts, a 12-year-old male jumped from the Cedar Lane overpass,&quot; Virginia State Police said in a statement. &quot;The impact incapacitated the vehicle’s driver.&quot; <br />
<br />
Police said the car's passenger then &quot;steered the vehicle off the interstate ... [and] came to a stop on the left shoulder against the jersey wall.&quot; <br />
<br />
The 12-year-old boy, who hasn't been identified, was rushed to Fairfax Inova Hospital to be treated for &quot;life-threatening injuries,&quot; according to police. <br />
<br />
&quot;He's still alive,&quot; Virginia State Police Spokeswoman Corinne Geller confirmed to ABC News. <br />
<br />
Harris's uncle said Harris's boyfriend was in the passenger seat at the time of the crash. He described her death as a &quot;a freak accident.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She was driving, her boyfriend was in the passenger seat, when all of a sudden comes this body into the windshield,&quot; Everett Bruce told ABC News. Bruce said he learned about the crash when his younger brother, Harris's father, called him two hours later. <br />
<br />
The state police confirmed in a statement that the &quot;front-seat passenger&quot; was &quot;was not injured&quot; as a result of the collision. <br />
<br />
&quot;He’s a little bit in shock,&quot; Bruce added of Harris's boyfriend. <br />
<br />
The news of Harris's death shook Bruce, but he said her father is especially devastated. <br />
<br />
&quot;His heart is crushed, I could tell by the conversation,&quot; Bruce said. &quot;Marisa was his only child and she was daddy's girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
But as for why she died, Bruce said his emotions are a mix of fury and confusion. <br />
<br />
&quot;This boy is 12 years old, why would he commit suicide?&quot; Bruce said. &quot;I don't get it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bruce said that Harris grew up in Olney, Maryland and had traveled the world. <br />
<br />
She was a graduate student studying clinical psychology. <br />
<br />
As an undergraduate, Harris attended Towson University. <br />
<br />
Bruce said his niece was just getting started to live an altruistic life helping children. <br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't even get an opportunity to begin her life,&quot; Bruce said. &quot;She was just snatched too young, too early. She was just starting to blossom in her life and this freak accident happened. That's what kills me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Out of all the cars on the highway this had to happen to her,&quot; Bruce added. &quot;It's like playing Russian roulette, somehow it was chosen that it would be her car at that time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Neither Harris's mother nor father had responded to ABC News' request for comment at the time of publication.

<br />
without going nuts on it...do yer homework on this son of a bitch and what' s been going on the British Establishment and how it operates<br />
like, when folk start noticing the &quot;little man behind the curtain&quot;, or rather, the terrible evil deeds that the British Establishment and &quot;<i>Entitled Evil Cunts R Us From Oxford &amp; Cambridge</i>&quot; become TOO obvious, when folk they cannot dismiss start calling for action or prosecution...<br />
the Establishment protects their &quot;button man&quot; by giving him lots of prestigious honours to make him socially unassailable, 'cause like, you know, they still believe in privilege and entitlement of their class, ah huh :rolleyes:<br />
happened DOZENS of times, when they've used someone to cover up their crimes, or, when the villain has too much info on the Establishment's crimes<br />
<br />
PO'd beyond belief. remember folks, that fucker has condemned me to a slow miserable bloody death, I fail to see any reason why I shouldn't be fucking pissed off at that, or especially fact he's also caused enormous grief, torment to children with this ailment. I may want his head on a pike, but I wouldn't condemn the bastard to this torture.</div>

			Braden Matejka survived a bullet to the head in the Las Vegas massacre. Then, the death threats started coming.<br />
<br />
“You are a lying piece of shit and I hope someone truly shoots you in the head,” a commenter wrote to Matejka on Facebook, one week after a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds more. “Your soul is disgusting and dark! You will pay for the consequences!” said another. A Facebook meme quickly spread with a photo of him after the shooting, captioned: “I’m a lying cunt!”<br />
<br />
The 30-year-old victim – who narrowly escaped death in the worst mass shooting in modern US history – has faced a torrent of online abuse and harassment, forcing him to shut down his social media accounts and disappear from the internet. The bullying, taunting and graphic threats have also spread to his family and friends.

</div><div class="bbcode_container">

	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Conspiracy theorists – some of whom claim that the government staged the shooting on 1 October or that the tragedy was a hoax – have targeted survivors and victims’ loved ones, spamming every social media platform with misinformation and abuse. On Facebook and YouTube in particular, users have published viral posts and videos calling people like Braden “crisis actors”, alleging they were hired to pose as victims.<br />
<br />
While fringe conspiracies have often emerged after national tragedies and major historical events, social media has dramatically expanded the scope and scale of the problem, making it easy for false claims to reach massive audiences and giving trolls easy access to targets online.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>What level of vile do you have to be to do something like this?  How have we, as a country, slipped so far that these things are happening?  Sandy Hook goes back pre-Trump, but I can only imagine it will get worse.  I don't want to live on this planet anymore...</div>
