			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So I received a company phone - Samsung Galaxy S7 with Android 9/Oreo.<br />
<br />
I'm required to utilize a PIN lock for almost everything (bootup, unlocking the screen, using email).<br />
<br />
I expect to receive texts from certain contacts (including one email-generated text message) that I need to be able to hear the alerts for in almost all cases.<br />
<br />
The default messaging app on the phone didn't allow any customization of the alerts from contacts, so I downloaded Google's <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Android Messages</a>.<br />
<br />
This allows a little more customization of contact notification priorities.  However, I'm still not getting any vibration or notification sounds when texts appear - even the tests that I've sent from my personal phone don't trigger notification vibrations or sound.<br />
<br />
I need to be able to receive these texts, and hear the notification at all times*.  Even if it wakes me up.<br />
<br />
*Though naturally I'd want to be able to silence them for going to a movie.<br />
<br />
Anyone know a messaging app or other notification trigger app that could do this for me?</div>

			YOKOHAMA--An 88-year-old man poisoned to death here in 2016 was one of many patients administered with an antiseptic solution at specific times by an ex-nurse because she wanted to avoid facing bereaved families, according to investigative sources.<br />
<br />
Ayumi Kuboki confessed that she poisoned patients who were seriously ill over a period of two months in 2016, the sources said.<br />
<br />
Kuboki, a resident of the city’s Tsurumi Ward, said during police questioning before her arrest that she targeted patients in serious condition who she thought were likely to die during her shift.<br />
<br />
<b>She allegedly accelerated their deaths to avoid the task of explaining the circumstances of the patients’ deaths to relatives falling on her, which she said to police was “troublesome.” </b><br />
<br />
Kuboki, 31, was arrested on July 7 on suspicion of poisoning Sozo Nishikawa with an antiseptic solution at Oguchi Hospital in Yokohama’s Kanagawa Ward on Sept. 18, 2016. His blood samples showed a surface-activating agent component in high concentrations. The agent is contained in benzalkonium chloride, an antiseptic solution.<br />
<br />
However, police are not convinced by Kuboki’s claims that she targeted only very sick patients.<br />
<br />
Among the patients who died during the period in question were those whose health conditions were not that serious, according to the sources.<br />
<br />
In the case of Nishikawa, Kuboki allegedly snuck into the patient’s room right before her night shift began on Sept. 18, 2016.<br />
<br />
Nishikawa, who lived in Yokohama’s Aoba Ward, died after his condition took a sudden turn for the worse immediately after Kuboki entered his room. His heart rate began dropping around 4:50 p.m., and he died at 7 p.m.<br />
<br />
Kuboki had arrived at the hospital at around 3 p.m. that day to prepare for the night shift, which started at 5 p.m., according to the sources.<br />
<br />
But when Nishikawa died, a nurse who had taken care of him during the day shift was still in the hospital and broke the news of his death to his family.<br />
<br />
Police believe that Kuboki administered the antiseptic solution to Nishikawa between 3 p.m. and 4:55 p.m.<br />
<br />
Nurses worked in pairs during hospital shifts. Kuboki apparently entered Nishikawa’s room while another nurse on the night shift was being briefed by a nurse they were taking over from the day shift.<br />
<br />
They are investigating how she administered the antiseptic solution, according to the sources.<br />
<br />
Nishikawa was on an intravenous drip, but police believe that he was poisoned by the administration of a large amount of antiseptic solution over a short period of time, rather than injection via a drip.

			YOKOHAMA – A 31-year-old former nurse was arrested Saturday for allegedly murdering an elderly patient in 2016 at a Yokohama hospital where three other patients also died under suspicious circumstances, police said.<br />
<br />
Ayumi Kuboki has admitted to killing Sozo Nishikawa, 88, who died on Sept. 18, 2016, at what was then Oguchi Hospital in Kanagawa Ward, according to the police. He was found to have been poisoned with a surfactant compound.<br />
<br />
Kuboki told them she injected disinfectant into intravenous drip bags used to treat about 20 patients, according to investigative sources.<br />
<br />
Traces of a surfactant compound were also found in the bodies of three other patients who died. One of them, Nobuo Yamaki, 88, died two days after Nishikawa in the same room, and the same type of toxic substance was found in his body and in an intravenous drip bag that had been used to treat him, according to police.<br />
<br />
Kuboki has told police she repeatedly injected disinfectant into drip bags, the sources said, adding they are investigating the possibility that the nurse killed Yamaki as well.<br />
<br />
Starting in July 2016 and continuing until Sept. 20 of the same year, 48 patients died at the hospital, including five patients on a single day in late August and four on one day in early September.<br />
<br />
The substances found in their bodies were the same as the disinfectant used at the nurses’ station on the fourth floor of the hospital where the two men were hospitalized.<br />
<br />
Among about 50 unused drip bags at the nurses’ station, about 10 were found to have small puncture holes in them. The police believe someone may have used a syringe to inject the disinfectant into the bags.<br />
<br />
Soon after the deaths of the two patients, police began investigating the case as possible murders committed by someone with knowledge of the hospital and medicine.<br />
<br />
Shortly after police began investigating the deaths, the nurse said that she was not involved in the incidents and had not noticed anything unusual at the hospital.<br />
<br />
Before she was arrested, Kuboki flatly denied lacing IV drip bags with poisonous substances, and said she was “shocked” by the incidents and “felt very sorry for the victims as well as their families.”<br />
<br />
Beginning about six months before Nishikawa’s death, a series of suspicious incidents occurred at the hospital. In April 2016 shredded nurses’ aprons were found, in June part of a patient’s medical records was lost, and in August a nurse tasted what she believes was bleach in a bottled drink.<br />
<br />
According to her mother, Kuboki told her she was afraid of working at the hospital at night and wanted to quit her job.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm 6'2 but I have a 38 inseam, 40 for some brands.<br />
<br />
Most of my height is in my torso.<br />
<br />
I can sometimes order some stuff off of thinkgeek or various other sites and have them fit so long as there's a stretchy all-cotton 2x or a 3x for polyester, but the latter doesn't stay tucked in well the second I move my arms.<br />
<br />
I'd love to custom pay for some nerdy computer jokes that won't offend the people I work with (So stuff like SELECT * FROM 'users' WHERE 'clue'=&gt;1; 0 rows returned) would not work out well.<br />
<br />
I also like Star Wars (so &quot;never tell me the odds&quot; on a cotton polo would not suck. Amazing how hard it is to find that) and Star Trek (This is my red shirt complete with words and an embroidered starfleet symbol would be funny on weekly meeting day, since I'm the lowest rung on the management totem pole)<br />
<br />
Most of the stuff I'm searching has abysmal ideas for what to mass-print on shirts based on the most recent semi-popular movie.<br />
<br />
Anyone know anything better as a vendor?</div>

		<hr />
		
			On Friday, dumped out with the least desirable news of the week came word that a lawsuit arguing that Detroit students were being denied an education had been dismissed. <br />
<br />
 Perhaps you remember the case. MT presented a cover story about it last year. With the help of a public interest law firm, a handful of Detroit students charged in federal court that educational officials in Michigan — including Gov. Rick Snyder — denied them access to an education of any quality.<br />
<br />
 The lawsuit took pains to illustrate how Detroit's schools — run under a state-appointed emergency manager — were a welter of dysfunction: overcrowded classrooms, lack of textbooks and basic materials, unqualified staff, leaking roofs, broken windows, black mold, contaminated drinking water, rodents, no pens, no paper, no toilet paper, and unsafe temperatures that had classes canceled due to 90-degree heat or classrooms so cold students could see their breath.<br />
<br />
At times, without teachers or instructional materials, students were simply herded into rooms and asked to watch videos. One student claimed to have learned all the words to the film Frozen in high school. The lawsuit even mentions one eighth grade student who &quot;taught&quot; a seventh and eighth grade math class for a month because no teacher could be found. <br />
<br />
 We had described such teaching methods as a sort of &quot;throw a book at them and hope they learn something&quot; method of education — only without the book to throw. Student cannot be expected to learn when they are simply &quot;warehoused for seven hours a day&quot; in &quot;an unsafe, degrading, and chaotic environment&quot; that is a school &quot;in name only.&quot; It is hardly surprising that, at the plaintiff's schools, which serve almost exclusively low-income children of color, almost 99 percent of the students are unable to achieve proficiency in state-mandated subjects.<br />
<br />
 Last year, the state moved for dismissal, arguing that the 14th Amendment contains no reference to literacy. <br />
<br />
 Then, last week, U.S. District Judge Stephen Murphy III agreed with the state.<br />
<br />
 Literacy is important, the judge noted. But students enjoy no right to access to being taught literacy. All the state has to do is make sure schools run. If they are unable to educate their students, that's a shame, but court rulings have not established that &quot;access to literacy&quot; is &quot;a fundamental right.&quot;<br />
<br />
 At the close of last year's story, one of the plaintiffs in the case, Jamarria Hall, had reflected on his experiences at Detroit's Osborn High School and described the institution as a &quot;crab barrel&quot; — where you can't escape because you keep getting pulled, or pushed, back in.<br />
<br />
 He had said the state was one of those forces pushing any crabs who'd escape back in. &quot;'Cause, starting out, they're the ones at the top of the barrel.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Apparently, we may add the U.S. government to those pushing crabs back in their barrel.

			At least two suspected rhino poachers have been mauled to death and eaten by lions on a South African game reserve, officials say.<br />
<br />
Rangers discovered the remains of two, possibly three, people in a lion enclosure in the Sibuya reserve, near the south-east town of Kenton-on-Sea.<br />
<br />
A high-powered rifle and an axe were also found.<br />
<br />
There has been a rise in poaching in Africa in recent years, to feed growing demand for rhino horn in parts of Asia.<br />
<br />
In China, Vietnam and elsewhere, rhino horn is erroneously believed to have aphrodisiac qualities.<br />
<br />
Sibuya reserve owner Nick Fox said in a statement on the reserve's Facebook page that the suspected poachers entered the reserve late on Sunday night or early on Monday morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;They strayed into a pride of lions - it's a big pride so they didn't have too much time,&quot; Mr Fox told AFP news agency.<br />
<br />
<b>&quot;We're not sure how many there were - there's not much left of them.&quot; </b><br />
<br />
The remains were first spotted at 16:30 local time on Tuesday (14:30 GMT).<br />
<br />
An anti-poaching team arrived on the scene, where a hunting rifle with silencer, a long axe and wire-cutters - equipment generally used by rhino poachers - were also found. <br />
<br />
Several lions had to be tranquilised before the remains could be recovered, Mr Fox added.<br />
<br />
Police have been patrolling the area in case any of the suspected poachers survived.<br />
<br />
Nine rhinos were killed by poachers in Eastern Cape province, where the reserve is located, this year alone.<br />
<br />
More than 7,000 have been killed in South Africa in the past decade.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>&quot;Disclaimer: for the advanced aquarist only. This is a custom made CO2 regulator with vts needle valve. The needle valve is extremely precise, but a very fragile and expensive piece of hardware.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sold this last week to someone who said they knew what they were doing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Today they emailed me that the  &quot; needle pin on the regulator broke, cause the valve was stripped &quot;<br />
<br />
My response: are you talking about the needle valve on the solenoid, or the knob on the regulator? The knob on the regulator is a Harris, so it is extremely heavy duty, but the needle valve is very fragile, so it being a precise dial needs only minute adjustments.<br />
<br />
Their response : i couldn't get the gas to move out of the valve, so i tried opening the valves all the way, abd the needle pin popped off. <br />
<br />
<br />
Me: could you send me a picture of this?<br />
<br />
Their response: <a href="https://www.graffes.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=5782&amp;d=1530757921"  title="Name:  20180704_124138.jpg

Me: the solenoid isn't plugged in. The valve won't open unless the solenoid is on. <br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>...and I can't say I enjoyed myself very much. Nothing against the show itself, it was actually very well done (albeit some of the songs were a bit to politically charged for my tastes) but my issue is deeper than that. I just don't feel very patriotic these days or very proud to be an American. I'm actually embarrassed and increasingly terrified.<br />
<br />
The same thing happened to me at Disney last week. We went to see the Hall of Presidents and I was forced to watch a robot Donald Trump recite the oath of office. It took every ounce of willpower not to stand up and scream Bullshit and Traitor. Probably should have but the MAGA's in the crowd probably would have shot me.</div>

<br />
Beginning Monday, July 2nd, we will no longer allow any advertisements in the Group Finder for in-game services such as carries or boosts, including those being offered in exchange for in-game gold. The Group Finder is intended for -- as the name suggests -- finding groups, and these advertisements make it difficult to find active groups that are currently being formed. Additionally, these are often used as a cover for real-money sales, particularly given that in-game gold cannot be transferred cross-realm.<br />
<br />
Note that this does not change our policy on selling things such as raid carries for in-game gold. Those are still allowed, but should be advertised through realm-specific methods such as trade chat.<br />
<br />
We’ll be adding an “advertisement” option to the Group Finder’s right-click reporting function with Patch 8.0, but in the meantime, they can be reported using the “spam” option. Thank you for your understanding, and for helping us keep the Group Finder clear of unwanted advertisements.</div>

There's some hilarious ones... here's a small sample:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dearest Emma, Colonel Hannity's red hats ambushed us at the Galleria yesterday.  Many brave men were lost. We are down to our last wedge of Brie and the Chardonnay is dangerously close to room temperature.  Remember: Tuesday is recycling .  #SecondCivilWarLetters&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dearest, An entire battalion of red hats fell to us yesterday.  We made them read entire books of the Bible instead of out of context passages.  The heads of three exploded on the spot others wandered away as if their lives were a lie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dearest Gladys, I saw a man lose his life today. His eyes looked past me, toward what I did not know. I kneeled at my fallen enemy. 'I could’ve been on your side,' he revealed between coughs. 'But for her emails,' he said as he met his fate.&quot;</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This is a dull month and I wouldn't blame you for sleeping this one out, but there are still a few things worth your consideration.<br />
<br />
The most notable game release this month is <b>Octopath Traveler</b> on the Switch. Made by the Bravely Default team, this is that game that first got attention due to its blend of 3D backdrops/lighting and 2D sprite characters. It's a roleplaying game and the central conceit is that there are 8 different characters with their own stories and abilities. I don't expect universal acclaim on this one, but I do think its a big deal if you are a fan of the genre.<br />
<br />
The only other big new game this month is <b>The Banner Saga 3</b>. I presume this to be the conclusion of the Nordic inspired strategy/tactics rpg series with a striking old animation art style.<br />
<br />
The rest of the month is rounded out by remakes and ports of things you might have missed. <b>Captain Toad Treasure Tracker</b> on Switch and 3DS, <b>No Man's Sky</b> on Xbox, and <b>Mega Man X Legacy Collection</b> on just about everything.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've done C++, I've led projects that involved code review that I had to do and I despise C++ as a result.<br />
<br />
As someone who majored in web development, I've done PHP, Coldfusion, ASP (with VB, pre- .NET) and my fair share of MS SQL/MySQL both as a result and later as a DBA on the MS side of things.<br />
<br />
I despise java for the time being. If they get their shit together, I might be happy with the lack of Oracle involvement, but that's up to the Open folks and them cleaning up ages and platforms of mess.<br />
<br />
I've coded IRC bots in python. I've made perl-cgi sites.<br />
<br />
That all said, I have plateaued in a programming sense and I've looked into a few of these new &quot;frameworks as languages&quot; and I don't like any bit of what appears to be their transience.<br />
<br />
Given my hate for C++, does anyone have a suggestion for a sustained, in-use, long-lasting language for me to learn that involves a compiler?<br />
<br />
Part of me wants to go x86 assembly, but I don't have the hardware setup to do so.<br />
<br />
I want to learn to be able to compile useful things that address the platform itself, though.<br />
<br />
I don't know what's possible so I don't really have a use case for my desire, all I know is...I can do more closer to the hardware than I am doing currently.<br />
<br />
Are there options other than C that do low-level stuff?<br />
 <br />
Most of what I'm going to want is going to be windows-based. (edit -- as the platform OS I'd be working and connecting and programming FROM)</div>

			A former Seattle-based attorney for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was sentenced to four years in prison for wire fraud and an identity theft scheme that used the identities of several aliens. Federal prosecutors say he used ICE databases and computers to commit his crimes.<br />
<br />
Raphael A. Sanchez, 44, is the former chief counsel for ICE's Office of Principal Legal Advisor, according to the Department of Justice.<br />
<br />
Sanchez pleaded guilty in February to one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft, according to a statement from DOJ. Sanchez was also ordered to pay over $190,000 in restitution -- the amount prosecutors say he stole using fraudulent credit card accounts he opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raphael Sanchez was entrusted with overseeing the honest enforcement of our country's immigration laws,&quot; said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Cronan in a statement. &quot;Instead, Sanchez abused that trust, and capitalized on his position at ICE to exploit his victims and line his own pockets.&quot;<br />
<br />
DOJ said Sanchez admitted to intentionally defrauding aliens in various stages of immigration removal proceedings. Sanchez allegedly used their identities to open lines of credit and personal loans. He also manipulated credit bureau files, transferred funds to himself and made purchases in using credit cards obtained in the names of his victims.<br />
<br />
Sanchez admitted that he obtained the information using ICE's computer database, and used his work computer to forge Social Security cards and Washington state driver's licenses, according to DOJ. He also listed his address as the aliens' home addresses on the accounts he opened.<br />
<br />
Prosecutors say Sanchez also listed the names of three aliens as dependents on tax returns.
