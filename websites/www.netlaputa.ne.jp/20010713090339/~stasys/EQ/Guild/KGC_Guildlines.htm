<P>KGC(Karana Guild Central)は、Karana ServerでのGod,GodClassおよびPlaneのRaid管理を行う有志の集まりです。KGCを興した目的は、特定のGuildがGodやPlaneを占有してしまい、他のPlayerがそこで遊べないと言うような事を防ぐ事が第一です。<BR>
Karana Serverで上記のRaidを行おうとした場合、まずKGCに登録して、各Raidの待ち配列に組込んでもらう必要があります。そして、KGCが規定する基本的な規則を守る必要があります。<BR>
<BR>
以下に2001年5月版の「Karana Guild Central
Rules and Guidelines」を掲載しておくので、一度目を通しておいてください。<BR>
</P>
<P><FONT color="#ffcc00">Below are the rules and guidelines followed
by all members of the KGC. Any questions,
please post in the members forum.</FONT></P>

      1. Post your in game name and your
      guild
      name in your posts often so we know
      who you
      are representing. <BR>
      <BR>
      2. Use common sense when posting and
      don't
      flame. <BR>
      <BR>
      Planes Scheduling <BR>
      <BR>
      1. A thread is started on Monday morning
      by the schedule administrator (currently
      Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst) or a designee
      for
      people to post their requested plane
      days
      for the next week. <BR>
      <BR>
      2. When scheduling a plane day you
      may list
      as many choices as necessary to try
      to ensure
      you get a day. Do not edit your post
      in the
      schedule thread. The schedule admin
      will
      compile the choices and attempt to
      give everyone
      a plane day, with priority given based
      on
      the current planes rotation. (unless
      rule
      3 below applies). The planes rotation
      contains
      all the guilds/alliances and is rotated
      by
      seven guilds every week (this number
      may
      change as guilds are added or removed
      from
      the rotation). <BR>
      <BR>
      3. You can make ONE plane reservation
      per
      guild/alliance during the initial scheduling
      period. If a spot is still open after
      the
      schedule is posted, you are welcome
      to schedule
      another plane day then. The only exception
      is you can book multiple PoA days (maximum
      of three) due to the tactics involved
      with
      this zone. <BR>
      <BR>
      4. You can book for the PM (4:00 PM
      PST)
      slot after an Asian guild. Be aware
      that
      the spawns may be scarce, do not expect
      a
      fully popped plane. <BR>
      <BR>
      Planes Courtesy <BR>
      1. You should be out of the plane by
      4:00
      am EST (1:00 AM PST) to allow for respawn
      for the next guild. Please be especially
      considerate if an Asian or European
      guild
      is following you. <BR>
      <BR>
      2. Do not enter a plane when it is
      not your
      plane day unless you have permission
      from
      the leader or an officer of the guild/alliance
      that has scheduled the plane for the
      day.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      3. Be flexible when dealing with guilds
      that
      are up for gods. If you are in a plane
      and
      a god spawns, you must notify the guild
      up
      for the god immediately in game or
      via KGC,
      so they can kill the god during the
      required
      24 hour time period. This includes,
      but is
      not limited to, informing them as soon
      as
      you know CT is up, letting them know
      when
      you're done (with advanced warning
      to allow
      for gathering time), and if you're
      moving
      slowly, inviting them to help you clear
      the
      plane more quickly (with all regular
      zone
      drops going to the guild owning the
      plane
      for the day).<BR>
      <BR>
      4. If you fail on successive plane
      raids
      you should re-evaluate your strategy
      and
      stop scheduling planes for a while.
      Join
      an alliance if you need help or ask
      to attend
      someone else's plane raid for experience
      . It is very frustrating for the rest
      of
      us to see a plane go to waste with
      so many
      guilds getting left out during the
      scheduling
      process. <BR>
      <BR>
      Large Target Rotations (Cazic Thule,
      Innoruuk,
      Lady Vox, Lord Nagafen, Venril Sathir,
      Trakanon,
      Severillous, Talendor, Gorenaire) <BR>
      <BR>
      1. You must make your attempt to kill
      the
      target the day of spawn unless it spawns
      after 8:00 PM for your guild's local
      regional
      time (ex: EST/PST for USA, GMT+9 for
      Japan,
      GMT+1 for Euro). If it spawns after
      8:00
      p.m. local time, you should begin your
      attempt
      the next day within 24 hours of the
      target's
      spawn time. <BR>
      <BR>
      2. If you're going to pass, do so within
      a reasonable amount of time. (before
      5:00
      PM local). On rotations where pass/fail
      is
      tracked, passing when you are currently
      up
      for the target counts as a failed attempt.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      3. If a large target spawns 6-8 hours
      before
      patch or server maintenance, it MAY
      be considered
      FFA. The guild that is up for a target
      when
      a patch is imminent may NOT declare
      the target
      FFA and then engage the target. The
      guild
      up for the target MUST make an attempt
      to
      find a swap if they are not going to
      engage
      the target. <BR>
      <BR>
      In the case of a FFA god, the guild
      scheduled
      to be in the plane the day/night before
      patch
      can kill the god if they are able to,
      or
      call in another guild to kill the god.
      The
      &quot;god&quot; group may help them
      clear
      spawn with the understanding that all
      planar
      loot goes to the &quot;plane&quot;
      guild
      and all god loot goes to the &quot;god&quot;
      guild. <BR>
      <BR>
      Use your judgement. We have been handling
      these rare FFA situations relatively
      fine
      for close to two years now. If you
      think
      you are going to be flamed for your
      actions
      by a good portion of the KGC members,
      it
      is probably an abuse of the FFA rules.<BR>
      <BR>
      4. There should be no help from ANY
      members
      of other guilds/alliances for large
      targets
      if their guild/alliance occupies a
      spot within
      that particular large target rotation.
      (this
      does not apply to Vox/Nag due to level
      restrictions).
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Example: Do not accept or solicit help
      from
      anyone in the Inny rotation if you
      are killing
      Inny. If you are killing Trakanon,
      getting
      help from another guild/alliance in
      the Inny
      or Vox rotation is okay as long as
      they are
      not in the Trakanon rotation. Keep
      all help
      such as this to a minimum as it is
      the spirit
      of the KGC that each guild occupying
      a slot
      does so because they are able to do
      it on
      their own and understands the concept
      behind
      having a rotation. It is all about
      being
      equal and therefore sharing equally.
      Having
      1-2 groups but gathering 4-5 more groups
      in various other guilds/alliances would
      be
      considered abuse. <BR>
      <BR>
      5. Post the results of the large target
      attempt
      on the KGC ASAP (pass/fail/success)
      so the
      next guild can prepare for their turn.
      It
      is customary to post the loot obtained.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      6. Kunark Outdoor dragons follow a
      progressive
      scale of Sev -&gt; Tal -&gt; Gor. You
      need
      to kill Severillous before entering
      Talendor
      rotation, Talendor before entering
      Gorenaire
      rotation. <BR>
      <BR>
      7. If you pass/fail on Trak 3 times
      in a
      row you will drop out of the rotation
      for
      2 cycles or 3 weeks, whichever is longer.
      Your pass/fail count will be designated
      in
      parentheses beside your slot in the
      rotation.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      8. If you pass/fail on Nagafen, Lady
      Vox,
      Severillous, Talendor, or Gorenaire
      2 times
      in a row you will drop out of the rotation
      for 1 cycle. Your pass/fail count will
      be
      designated in parentheses beside your
      slot
      in the rotation. <BR>
      <BR>
      9. Do not kill fire giants on server
      reset
      unless you are up for Nagafen. Do not
      kill
      fire giants AT ALL if Nagafen is up.
