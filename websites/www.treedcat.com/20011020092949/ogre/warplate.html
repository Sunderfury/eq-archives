<center><h1>Making Ogre War Plate Armor</h1></center>
<p>War Plate armor is an expensive endeavor for the rich and accomplished Ogre master smith.  It requires great skill and a large supply of platinum, but is the best armor an ogre can make.
<p>Ogre war plate requires blood temper which is very hard to come by since one of the components (elf blood) is very rare.  This temper is made by brewers.
<p>Another oddity with ogre plate is that Adamantite ore is only sold in Neriak, so we have to truck up there to get it.  This ore is very expensive.  it will cost at least 100pp to make the simplest pieces of war plate.
<p>War plate must also be made in the Oggok forj.  It will not work in a normal forj.
<p><font color=red>NOTE:</font> Enchanted Warplate exists and can be made by using Enchanted adamantite.  This armor can be imbued in the same way as splintmail.  The recipe for enchanted folded adamantite sheets is identical to that for regular folded sheets, except that the ore must first be enchanted by a level 49 enchanter.  The ore for the chain jointing must also be enchanted.  Each piece must be made with either an imbued jade or amber.  Otherwise, the Recipes are exactly the same as for regular war plate.  
<p>One extra would be the need to combine three large bricks to make a block.  Blocks cannot be enchanted, only large bricks.
<p>
<p>The recipes for War Plate armor are as follows:
