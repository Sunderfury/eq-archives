<center><h1>Making Ogre splintmail Armor</h1></center>
<p>Ogre Splintmail is an excellent alternative for shamen who are looking for an intermediate armor between banded and totemic armor.  It is relatively lightweight and has similar or slightly better armor class to bronze armor depending on the piece.
<p>This armor can be imbued which means that in the making of the armor, an imbued gem is placed in the forj with the other components and the resulting armor can only be used by followers of whatever deity that imbued gem belongs to.  Priest classes are able to imbue these gems.  For ogres, the gems that will usually come into play are Jade (Rallos Zek), and Amber (Cazic Thule).  In the case of splintmail, jade adds 3 strength to each piece of armor.  I am unsure of the stats added by an imbued amber.
<p>Ogre Splintmail requires blood temper which is very hard to come by since one of the components (elf blood) is very rare.  This temper is made by brewers.
<p>The sheets of adamantite metal can only be purchased in Neriak.  They cost anywhere between 11 to 15pp depending on charisma.  
<p>Ogre Splintmail must be made in the Oggok forj.  It will not work in a normal forj.
<p><font color=red><blink>VERY IMPORTANT: </font></blink> Non imbued versions of this armor may not be wearable by ogres.  If you make a non imbued piece, you may be sorry.
<p>
