<center><h1>Basic Blacksmithing guide</h1></center>
<p>
<P>
Good day to you, and welcome to Unga's guide to blacksmithing for dark races. 
<P>This guide is a compilation of my experience as well as info from other 
guides I have read. The "evil" races of Norath are at a distinct disadvantage in 
the field of blacksmithing. Many smithing materials are only found in Freeport or some other "good" city, but that need not be a deterrent
<P>The most important stats for any blacksmith are Intelligence, Wisdom, and Strength.  Intelligence and wisdom determine how well one learns the skill, and strength serves as a failcheck for both learning and success rates.  Wisdom may also serve as a success rate check.  Ogres have an advantage in that we are exceptionally strong, though we are not particularly smart, so we learn smithing rather slowly.  There are rumors now that the effect of strength on blacksmithing has been reduced and my experience of late would tend to agree with that conclusion.
<p>The next stat that is important is charisma.  Without high charisma, you will buy for more, and sell for less.  Trust me, get some charisma gear and pump that charisma up to at least 75.  It wouldn't hurt to seek out a charisma buff from your local shaman before heading to the merchants too.
<P><B>Starting up (skill 1-21)</B> 
<P>Now, the most basic tools of the trade are Ore, water, a forge and lots of 
platinum. To skill to 21, you have several choices. You can dump skill points 
into smithing to take it up as far as it will let you (some say 15, some say 
20). You can also sharpen rusties to 21 (rusty weapon, sharpening stone), or 
even 27 with more valuable rusties (note, polearms cannot be sharpened, this includes halberds). The third option is to make metal bits till skill 21 (two small 
pieces of ore, one flask of water).
<P>Personally, I put 5 points into smithing, then sharpened weapons till about 
skill 18 and made metal bits to 21.  I would recommend making metal bits though.
<P><B>Toolboxes (skill 22-51)</B> 
<P>This is easy street.  Take the metal bits you have been making and make toolboxes (1 metal bit, one flask of water).  They are a container, so make sure you have at least one main inventory slot open, or you can always just let them fall on the ground.
<p>Toolboxes are very cheap to make and should skill you up quickly.
<P><B>Lanterns (51-68)</B> 
<P>Once Toolboxes become trivial, it is time to move on to Lanterns. Go 
to the blind fish and fill a few packs with small pieces of ore. Now go to 
Neriak foreign Quarter and make them into metal bits. Once you have only bits in 
the packs, go to the Ogre sisters who sell the pot molds, and buy several 
lantern molds. Next, go to the gobbler in Bites n Pieces and buy a bunch of 
bottles. Now, go to one of the forges and make Lanterns (1 bottle, 1 flask of 
water, 1 lantern casing mold, 1 metal bit. This should skill you up to 68 rather 
quickly. 
<P><B>Decisions, decisions (68-101+)</B> 
<P>Skewers, what fun.  As an ogre you cannot buy them anywhere. Why not? Because you 
are evil and they are only sold by "good" merchants. The choice is yours; 
you can mule them (kinda boring), you can start making banded (very 
expensive), or you can skip right to making sewing kits.  I tried muling, but found I was getting nowhere and that my skill 
went up faster with banded gorgets (1 gorget mold, 1 flask of water, 1 sheet of 
metal). If you do choose to go the banded route, make gorgets like I did. The 
molds are relatively cheap at 3sp each, and I did not fail too often.  Who knows, you might get lucky and find lots of players that want to buy gorgets, don't count on it though. I've sold 5 or six to players, 
the rest have gone back to the shop.   As I said, this is very expensive.  It took me nearly 400pp to get to master following this guide, but it is really the only choice you have unless you want to skip right to sewing kits, which Is actually a very good idea.
<P><B>After master (101-135)</B> 
<P>Ahh, sewing kits.  Finally, something that is not so expensive to make.  Still not great, but at least they only cost about 5 gold to make instead of 1.5 plat.  Sewing kits are made by placing one thimble mold, one needle mold, one metal bit, and one water flask in a forge.  I started making them at master since Gorgets become trivial at 105 anyway, and I was flat broke.  I relocated to Oggok, got bound there, and started spending some intimate time with the forge turning one and a half packs worth of ore into metal bits.  The molds can be bought from Murga in the Feerrott.
<p>This should quickly take your skill to 135, from there, you have only one way to skill up.  Keep in mind that this only yields small sewing kits, so don't plan on making any money from them.
<p><b>I just love spending lots of money to skill up (136-175)</b>
<p>Banded is your only option that I know of for skilling past 135.  Banded gloves will get you to 168, and cloaks will get you to 175.  
Some would suggest mantles, but gloves are less expensive.  You will want to make these in Neriak as the ore and the small molds are rather close to the forge.
<P>Well, that is it. Now you are ready to make plate or Cultural armor.
<P>If you have any suggestions or aditions, send e-mail to <A

<P>As a further thought, if you have a lot of plat, you might want to follow the speedsmithing guide 
found at KC's. You can follow the link below. This is actually the easiest idea 
for Dark races, though not at all money efficient.  <b>NOTE:</b> This will only get you to master smith, after which you can follow my guide.<BR>
