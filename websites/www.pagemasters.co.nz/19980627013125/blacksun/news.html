<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">I have updated members page with a few unproven
members, I welcome S'lyst Lynn to our ranks.&nbsp; Robin Yoper and I have
been working hard to buy a large forge, as a main base of operations until
we get a tower.&nbsp; I have taken the role of house smithy, so ingot donations
would be appreciated.&nbsp; I'm please to announce three promotions within
our house.&nbsp; First J has been promoted to Knight, he has worked hard
for Csky and has become a valued member in BSH.</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Secondly, Bucky is now officially house master
for BSH, this promotion has been coming for quite a while, I am confident
that Bucky has the ability to lead BSH to bigger and better things.&nbsp;
I myself have been appointed Regent for BSH by the High Lord of Csky, Casca.&nbsp;
I will be working closely with Bucky in assuring BSH members are well looked
after.&nbsp; So congratulations to J and Bucky for the promotion.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Updated members page, as you can see we need
more members! :) So everyone get recruiting Also Csky has a new stone,
which everyone needs to be added to. Let myself or one of the Commanders
know and we can gate you there. Id also like to welcome a friend from work
to the Clan, Jeremia Yoper, he will be in charge of the clans treasury
and also he is building up a blacksmith, so any spare ingots would be appreciated.
I would like to impose a tax which I need all members to abide by, at the
moment, csky has a tax of 500gp per fortnight (two weeks) which the commanders
and myself will be collection by the end of each fortnight. Id also like
to collect an extra 500gp per fortnight from each member to go toward a
tower for the BlackSun, if anybody finds this unfair, let me know. Any
comments are welcome.</FONT>
