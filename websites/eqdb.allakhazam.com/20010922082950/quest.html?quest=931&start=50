Talking to him he offers to tell you a secret but he needs a favor done first. If you say, "I will do a favor" he will give you a pick axe and ask that it be sharpened by a smith named Harkon.   Harkon is located at Scar's Edge, a weapon shop.  Say, "Stonetooth sent me."  He will tell you that he will sharpen the pick axe if you give him the pick and a chunk of velium.  Give Hakon the Pick Axe and a small block of Velium and you get some faction, and a new pick axe.   Go back into the mines and return the pick axe and you will get back something called "Velium Focus".  Magic, Lore, No Drop.  All classes, All races, no stat bonuses.  The Dwarf tells you that by slowing down you mind and body and using the focus you can talk to stone, for the stone is alive.  You bring the focus item to Phenocryst, a named geonid in Wakening Land at -3210, -397 inside a maze of caves.  You can hail him and such, the geonids conning indifferent to everybody as far as I can tell.<br> <br>You hail Phenocryst. Phenocryst speaks with a soundless voice, as if you are hearing your own thoughts. 'We sense you are attempting communication with us but do not understand what it is you are trying to convey. We are eager to know more. Perhaps there is one who knows the language of the stone and will speak with us' <br> <br>Then you give him the Velium Focus.<br><br>Phenocryst speaks to you from within your mind, 'You know the stone! This is wonderful! The fullfillment of the prophecy is now one step closer. The most ancient of the stone tells us that one not of stone will come forth and act as our harbringer of asscention. We believe you to be our harbringer. Please help us!'<br> <br>You reply, "how can I help you?"<br><br>Phenocryst speaks from within your mind as well as conveys a sense of joy empathically. 'It is said that the harbringer will find all of our people and unite them. When we join we will know all of our experiences and perhaps then be aware of how to proceed with the next step in our asscention. We implore you to find others like us and make them aware of us. You know the language of the stone and can tell them. We await your return with proof that you have spoken to them." Now you have to go to Crystal Caverns.  If you invis up and head down into the caverns, you'll pass through an orc area, then a dwarf area, then a tentacle terror and spiders area, and finally there's a long stretch of tunnel leading up to a zone out point.  That long stretch of tunnel is filled with geonids and they con the same as the ones in Wakening Land.  Give one of them the focus (any one, doesn't matter, you don't have to hail them or anything) and you'll get it back with the following message:<br><br>A geonid seems as if it doesn't recognize you as anything of importance. You attempt to speak with the geonid through your velium focus but all you are able to hear is the same though over and over.., Eat. You have gained no knowledge from these creatures but you notice your focus has been altered slightly.<br><br>The description on the focus doesn't change, but it is altered.  Take it back to Phenocryst in Wakening Land and give it to him.  The following will<br>happen:<br><br>Phenocryst sends it's thoughts to you, a feeling of disappointment washes over you, 'It seems the others are not aware of themselves yet. We are alone..So many questions yet we can find no answers. We have been given a very special gift but without direction we are lost. We must find who has made us aware of ourselves and why it has done so.'<br> <br>You say to Phenocryst, "Find what?"<br> <br>Phenocryst says in the form of thoughts, 'We must call to it. We must make ourselves heard past these rocks though. A menhir must be constructed to amplify our voice. The stones we will need are not found in this area though. We hear whispers of stones far away that have the ability to channel and amplify our thoughts. We ask you to gather these stones for us harbinger."<br><br>You say to Phenocryst, "I will gather these stones for you."<br><br>Phenocryst's thoughts flood your mind, 'Thank you Harbinger. We need 3 crystals. One of Beryl, one of Stibnite, and one of the purest Iron. These minerals will only be found deep within the earth where the geology is relatively stable. This Focus will aid you in finding the right crystals. Return it to me with the 3 crystals and we will construct our Menhir. Please hurry Harbinger, our prophecy awaits.<br> <br>Phenocryst gives you an item for telling him you'll gather the stones.  It's a magic, lore, no drop Elbaite Focus that has 5 charges of Identify.  It looks like a fire emerald.<br> <br>The stibnite crystal is found in The Great Divide.  If you enter the wurm caves in the center of that zone from the south, go up to the first right, go in and take the next right, you'll be in a room with two spawn points for wurms and there's a patch of blue crystal at the back of the room.  The stibnite is behind the crystals and looks like a bag on the floor.  It spawns every 1-2 hours or so I think.  The description of the item is "Bent Metallic Crystal".  It weights 20.0, is magic, lore, and no drop.  When you identify it, it identifies as "Stibnite for the Menhir".  To identify an item using the Elbaite Focus, target yourself, pick up the item and right click it on the Elbaite Focus in your inventory.  It won't change the description of the item, it'll just tell you what it is in your chat window.<br> <br>The Beryl crystal is in Split Paw.  It drops closer to the Isvha spawn now.  When you drop down and pass through the doorway, the stone spawns in the room with the water (before you swim in the underwater tunnel). It spawns behind a stalagmite/stalagtite combo that will be slightly to your left as you enter the area. The loc is positive 691, negative 5.  The item description is "Reddish Crystal" and it's also magic, lore, and no drop.  It weighs 10.0.  It identifies as "Beryl for the Menhir".<br> <br>The crystal of purest iron is in Burning Woods.  It's sitting on the meteor near Slixin Klex.  It's item description is "Heavy Metallic Crystal" and is<br>magic, lore, and no drop.  It weighs 14.0.<br> <br>Take these three crystals and the Elbaite Focus back to Wakening Lands to Phenocryst and you're ready for the next step.  Get 1-2 parties of 50+ players and bring 'em with you.  Due to the dragon that spawns in Wakening Land near the dragon portal, you might want to approach from skyshrine.  If you're going along the wall from skyshrine towards the caves, you want to gather your troops at the second cave entrance along the wall.  Phenocryst is closest to that entrance.  Get to know the path between you and him at this point so you're familiar with how to get out in a hurry.  At this point, all the geonids should con amiable to you.  Finishing the Velium Focus section achieves this faction adjustment.  Make sure you have a ranger in your party of friends.  You're going to have to track down some triggered MOBs and fight them.<br> <br>You submit the items to Phenocryst.<br> <br>Phenocryst makes no sound but it's voice fills your mind. 'We have always held our memories within the earth and stone but only recently have we become aware of them.  We do not know what happened or who gave us this wonderful gift but we can now access those memories and are aware of it's storage.  With that knowledge has come questions and desires.  When the prophecy comes to be then we will have our answers and fulfill our desires.'<br> <br>Phenocryst 's familiar thoughts flood into your mind again, 'You truly are the Harbinger, take this Focus as a mark of your friendship with us. Now we can construct the Menhir, we need ..,..,the stones speak.., There is a problem. Ones of flesh are coming, the large ones, 3 of them. They must not disturb us while we construct the Menhir! Please stop them Harbinger! bring us proof of their distruction along with your Focus and then we will begin the calling. Our asscention is at hand!'<br> <br>You lose the focus and the three crystals and in return gain another focus item with the description "Azurite Focus".  It's a magic, lore, no drop item weighing 0.5.<br> <br>Now head outside and start tracking.  After a few minutes, two "accolyte of Zek" giants will show up on track. A minute later or so, a Bloodpriest Loukond will show up on tracker as well.  You'll have to run out and pull the accolytes to you once you track them.  If they are snared, they still run quite fast.  These giants con blue at 52 and are quite magic resistant.  Make sure you pull these, they're almost more important than the Bloodpriest.  They get attacked by the various mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed before you can do the job.  If you have to pull mercenaries with the accolytes, do.  After killing both accolytes, loot them.  Each one has a medalion that has the description, "Holy Symbol of Zek", which is magic, no drop, and weighs 2.0.  After the accolytes are done, go out and get the Bloodpriest.  Bloodpriest Loukond should eventually walk up to the cave entrance and stand outside it if nobody pulls it.  After a minute of standing outside the cave, he depops, which is why you have to do the accolytes first (they pop first) then the bloodpriest (he'll get to the cave probably if you can't find him, the accolytes might not).  The bloodpriest cons blue at 52 and is just as magic resistant.  He drops a third and final medalion with the same description.  You must get all three medalions in order to for this part to prove fruitful.  When you kill the giants, you take the following faction hits: Kromzek (worse), Kromrif (worse), KingTormax (worse), and ClawsofVeeshan (better).  The giants never enter the caves to attack the geonids or anything.  Everything will happen outside the caves and the giants won't aggro the dragon if it's up either.  The Bloodpriest Loukond is also not to be confused with Priest Bjek, another giant who wanders in the area sometimes who is red at 52 and not related to this quest.<br> <br>Now.  Take your Azurite Focus and the three medalions to Phenocryst.  Submit them to Phenocryst.<br> <br>Phenocryst 's thoughts become your own, a feeling of joy overwhelms you, 'Because of you we can at last speak with our maker. We were once given a gift, and we ask that you accept this gift from us now so that we may come closer to that which we owe our sentience to. Now..,we must construct the Menhir..' <br> <br>You lose the Azurite Focus and medalions and get the following item in return, which is, it seems, the reward for this quest.<br> <br>Phenocryst's Focus [Magic, Lore, No Drop]<br>AC 5 DEX 3, CHR 3, INT 10, MANA 40, SV FIRE/DISEASE/POISON/COLD 3, SV MAGIC 5 Usable by all races but only usable by caster classes like wizards, enchanters, etc. and not hybrids.<br> <br>Then then geonids, led by Phenocryst, start walking around, through the halls and such.  When this happens, you see the following message:<br><br> "Phenocryst begins to resonate. All the stones about you begin to resonate seemingly at its command. The Geonids all begin moving, all to construct the Menhir."<br> <br>I'm assuming they get together at this point at make their Menhir and the quest is over.  I didn't stick around to watch because we got some tar goo on us and that put a dampener on things real quick.  It's very important to note that although geonids con indifferent or amiable, goo does not and if you get any of it on you and a geonid is close by, it'll aggro the geonid.  No idea why this is, it doesn't make any sense, but it's the case.  Also, enchanters can skip a huge chunk of this quest by casting Collaboration on Phenocryst and starting from the point where to say to him "I will gather these stones for you".  The Velium Focus half gives you the faction to be able to tell that to Phenocryst.  Provided an enchanter MAKES him amiable, they don't have to bother with the first half.</td></tr>

The giants didn't seem all that magic resistant but we did use spells to lower resists. DO NOT try this with two people, the giants spawn to fast and would be killed by roaming things before you could kill them all, as for the exact levels, the two Accolyte's were blue to me at 48, the Bloodpriest was yellow to me and he complete healed himself more then once when he got low on HP.

By far the hardest part of teh quest is the hardest because you need to be a bunch of people in one place.  What I was wondering and people maybe should look into is can you do a chain effect.  Like after these Geonids get done moving around after hopefully a short amount of time can you just have another person give them their parts and get more spawns.  So basiclly I was wondering how efficent and fast you can be in having one person go after another to complete the last part.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

If ye're lucky enough they tell ya secrets.

No, I cant tell ya what they tells me, but I kin help ya ta listen. But first ye'll need ta do me a favor heheh.' <br>  <br>You say, 'What favor?' <br>  <br>Normon Stonetooth says 'Ahh, well me pick is a bit dull, don't cut like it should. Up in the city proper ye kin find a weapons smith named Hakon. Take me pick axe and and tell him Stonetooth sent ye. Then give it to him, wait fer him ta sharpen it, an bring it back to me. Then I'll help ya ta listen to the stone.' <br>  <br>Hakon is in a weapon shop near the bank in Thurgadim.  Give Hakon the Pick Axe and a small block of Velium (these are the stackable kind from Crystal Caverns, dropped off orc miners). <br>  <br>Hakon Brightsteel says 'Excellent! I'll get ta work now.' Hakon whistles an unfamiliar tune as he repairs and sharpens the pick axe. 'Here ye are Zeldan . Watch that old Stonetooth, he's a few steins short of a keg, if ye know what I mean' <br>  <br>You get the pick back plus the following faction adjustments:  Coldain (better), DainFrostreaverIV (better), Kromzek (worse), and Kromrif (worse). <br>  <br>Go back into the mines and return the pick axe to Normon. <br>  <br>Normon Stonetooth says 'Ahhhh, good work Tashia.  Now ta speak with the stone ye need somethin ta focus on. Use this piece o Velium as yer focus. Ta speak the language o the stone ye need ta slow down like the stone. Rock looks like it don't move but it does, just real slow. So place yer focus on the stones ye wish ta speak with and get yerself real slow, both yer body an yer noggin. Then if yer quiet enough ye might hear 'em. An that's what's to it. <br>  <br>You receive an item in return with the description, "Velium Focus".  It's a magic, lore, no drop item with no stats. <br>  <br>You then bring the focus item to Phenocryst, a named geonid in Wakening Land at -3210, -397 inside a maze of caves.  You can hail him and such, the geonids conning indifferent to everybody as far as I can tell. <br>  <br>You hail Phenocryst. <br>  <br>Phenocryst speaks with a soundless voice, as if you are hearing your own thoughts. 'We sense you are attempting communication with us but do not understand what it is you are trying to convey. We are eager to know more. Perhaps there is one who knows the language of the stone and will speak with us' <br>  <br>Then you give him the Velium Focus. <br>  <br>Phenocryst speaks to you from within your mind, 'You know the stone! This is wonderful! The fullfillment of the prophecy is now one step closer. The most ancient of the stone tells us that one not of stone will come forth and act as our harbringer of asscention. We believe you to be our harbringer. Please help us!' <br>  <br>You reply, "how can I help you?" <br>  <br>Phenocryst speaks from within your mind as well as conveys a sense of joy empathically. 'It is said that the harbringer will find all of our people and unite them. When we join we will know all of our experiences and perhaps then be aware of how to proceed with the next step in our asscention. We implore you to find others like us and make them aware of us. You know the language of the stone and can tell them. We await your return with proof that you have spoken to them." <br>  <br>Now you have to go to Crystal Caverns.  If you invis up and head down into the caverns, you'll pass through an orc area, then a dwarf area, then a tentacle terror and spiders area, and finally there's a long stretch of tunnel leading up to a zone out point.  That long stretch of tunnel is filled with geonids and they con the same as the ones in Wakening Land.  Give one of them the focus (any one, doesn't matter, you don't have to hail them or anything) and you'll get it back with the following message: <br>  <br>A geonid seems as if it doesn't recognize you as anything of importance. You attempt to speak with the geonid through your velium focus but all you are able to hear is the same though over and over.., Eat. You have gained no knowledge from these creatures but you notice your focus has been altered slightly. <br>  <br>The description on the focus doesn't change, but it is altered.  Take it back to Phenocryst in Wakening Land and give it to him.  The following will happen: <br>  <br>Phenocryst sends it's thoughts to you, a feeling of disappointment washes over you, 'It seems the others are not aware of themselves yet. We are alone..So many questions yet we can find no answers. We have been given a very special gift but without direction we are lost. We must find who has made us aware of ourselves and why it has done so.' <br>  <br>You say to Phenocryst, "Find what?" <br>  <br>Phenocryst says in the form of thoughts, 'We must call to it. We must make ourselves heard past these rocks though. A menhir must be constructed to amplify our voice. The stones we will need are not found in this area though. We hear whispers of stones far away that have the ability to channel and amplify our thoughts. We ask you to gather these stones for us harbinger." <br>  <br>You say to Phenocryst, "I will gather these stones for you." <br>  <br>Phenocryst's thoughts flood your mind, 'Thank you Harbinger. We need 3 crystals. One of Beryl, one of Stibnite, and one of the purest Iron. These minerals will only be found deep within the earth where the geology is relatively stable. This Focus will aid you in finding the right crystals. Return it to me with the 3 crystals and we will construct our Menhir. Please hurry Harbinger, our prophecy awaits. <br>  <br>Phenocryst gives you an item for telling him you'll gather the stones.  It's a magic, lore, no drop Elbaite Focus that has 5 charges of Identify.  It looks like a fire emerald. <br>  <br>The stibnite crystal is found in The Great Divide.  If you enter the wurm caves in the center of that zone from the south, go up to the first right, go in and take the next right, you'll be in a room with two spawn points for wurms and there's a patch of blue crystal at the back of the room.  The stibnite is behind the crystals and looks like a bag on the floor.  It spawns every 1-2 hours or so I think.  The description of the item is "Bent Metallic Crystal".  It weights 20.0, is magic, lore, and no drop.  When you identify it, it identifies as "Stibnite for the Menhir".  To identify an item using the Elbaite Focus, target yourself, pick up the item and right click it on the Elbaite Focus in your inventory.  It won't change the description of the item, it'll just tell you what it is in your chat window. <br>  <br>The Beryl crystal is in Split Paw.  If you enter Split Paw and walk just until you reach the first open room, it's in there on the floor at location 0,0 pretty much.  It's not so much a room as it is an open patch in the hallway with straw on the floor.  Two gnolls spawn here on either side of the room.  The spawn time here is probably the same.  The item description is "Reddish Crystal" and it's also magic, lore, and no drop.  It weighs 10.0.  It identifies as "Beryl for the Menhir". <br>  <br>The crystal of purest iron is in Burning Woods.  It's sitting on the meteor near Slixin Klex.  It's item description is "Heavy Metallic Crystal" and is magic, lore, and no drop.  It weighs 14.0. <br>  <br>Take these three crystals and the Elbaite Focus back to Wakening Lands to Phenocryst and you're ready for the next step.  Get 1-2 parties of 50+ players and bring 'em with you.  Due to the dragon that spawns in Wakening Land near the dragon portal, you might want to approach from skyshrine.  If you're going along the wall from skyshrine towards the caves, you want to gather your troops at the second cave entrance along the wall.  Phenocryst is closest to that entrance.  Get to know the path between you and him at this point so you're familiar with how to get out in a hurry.  At this point, all the geonids should con amiable to you.  Finishing the Velium Focus section achieves this faction adjustment.  Make sure you have a ranger in your party of friends.  You're going to have to track down some triggered MOBs and fight them. <br>  <br>You submit the items to Phenocryst. <br>  <br>Phenocryst makes no sound but it's voice fills your mind. 'We have always held our memories within the earth and stone but only recently have we become aware of them.  We do not know what happened or who gave us this wonderful gift but we can now access those memories and are aware of it's storage.  With that knowledge has come questions and desires.  When the prophecy comes to be then we will have our answers and fulfill our desires.' <br>  <br>Phenocryst 's familiar thoughts flood into your mind again, 'You truly are the Harbinger, take this Focus as a mark of your friendship with us. Now we can construct the Menhir, we need ..,..,the stones speak.., There is a problem. Ones of flesh are coming, the large ones, 3 of them. They must not disturb us while we construct the Menhir! Please stop them Harbinger! bring us proof of their distruction along with your Focus and then we will begin the calling. Our asscention is at hand!' <br>  <br>You lose the focus and the three crystals and in return gain another focus item with the description "Azurite Focus".  It's a magic, lore, no drop item weighing 0.5. <br>  <br>Now head outside and start tracking.  After a few minutes, two "accolyte of Zek" giants will show up on track. A minute later or so, a Bloodpriest Loukond will show up on tracker as well.  You'll have to run out and pull the accolytes to you once you track them.  If they are snared, they still run quite fast.  These giants con blue at 52 and are quite magic resistant.  Make sure you pull these, they're almost more important than the Bloodpriest.  They get attacked by the various mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed before you can do the job.  If you have to pull mercenaries with the accolytes, do.  After killing both accolytes, loot them.  Each one has a medalion that has the description, "Holy Symbol of Zek", which is magic, no drop, and weighs 2.0.  After the accolytes are done, go out and get the Bloodpriest.  Bloodpriest Loukond should eventually walk up to the cave entrance and stand outside it if nobody pulls it.  After a minute of standing outside the cave, he depops, which is why you have to do the accolytes first (they pop first) then the bloodpriest (he'll get to the cave probably if you can't find him, the accolytes might not).  The bloodpriest cons blue at 52 and is just as magic resistant.  He drops a third and final medalion with the same description.  You must get all three medalions in order to for this part to prove fruitful.  When you kill the giants, you take the following faction hits: Kromzek (worse), Kromrif (worse), KingTormax (worse), and ClawsofVeeshan (better).  The giants never enter the caves to attack the geonids or anything.  Everything will happen outside the caves and the giants won't aggro the dragon if it's up either.  The Bloodpriest Loukond is also not to be confused with Priest Bjek, another giant who wanders in the area sometimes who is red at 52 and not related to this quest. <br>  <br>Now.  Take your Azurite Focus and the three medalions to Phenocryst.  Submit them to Phenocryst. <br>  <br>Phenocryst 's thoughts become your own, a feeling of joy overwhelms you, 'Because of you we can at last speak with our maker. We were once given a gift, and we ask that you accept this gift from us now so that we may come closer to that which we owe our sentience to. Now..,we must construct the Menhir..' <br>  <br>You lose the Azurite Focus and medalions and get the following item in return, which is, it seems, the reward for this quest. <br>  <br>Phenocryst's Focus [Magic, Lore, No Drop]<br>AC 5<br>DEX 3, CHR 3, INT 10, MANA 40, SV FIRE/DISEASE/POISON/COLD 3, SV MAGIC 5<br>Usable by all races but only usable by caster classes like wizards, enchanters, etc. and not hybrids. <br>  <br>Then then geonids, led by Phenocryst, start walking around, through the halls and such.  When this happens, you see the following message: <br>  <br>"Phenocryst begins to resonate. All the stones about you begin to resonate seemingly at its command. The Geonids all begin moving, all to construct the Menhir." <br>  <br>I'm assuming they get together at this point at make their Menhir and the quest is over.  I didn't stick around to watch because we got some tar goo on us and that put a dampener on things real quick.  It's very important to note that although geonids con indifferent or amiable, goo does not and if you get any of it on you and a geonid is close by, it'll aggro the geonid.  No idea why this is, it doesn't make any sense, but it's the case.  Also, enchanters can skip a huge chunk of this quest by casting Collaboration on Phenocryst and starting from the point where to say to him "I will gather these stones for you".  The Velium Focus half gives you the faction to be able to tell that to Phenocryst.  Provided an enchanter MAKES him amiable, they don't have to bother with the first half. <br>  <br>This quest was completed by Tashia, Dairys, and Nuala, with help from people on the EQ Casters and Safehouse forums like Zaxxa and Zeldan, as well as with some help from the Xegony guilds Jade Dragon, United Norrath, and Black Tower. <br>  <br>Tashia<br>52nd enchanter of United Norrath<br>Xegony Server <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

He tells you that you should now seek out who made the Geonids, but doesn't offer any clues on where to start.  (also, since he doesn't give the focus back, I'm wondering if the quest is broken here or if you can skip directly to this part if someone tells you about it?)<br><br>Anyways, so I'm thinking: who would animate a bunch of stone creatures and then give them intelligence?  Probably a mage.  That got me thinking that the next step here might be somewhere in Velketors Labrynth.  Unfortunately, the mobs in there are NASTY, some of them see through invis, and levitate doesn't work in there.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>On early expidetions of SoV my guild was wandering around Wakening Lands looking for PHAT LEWTs. What we found were several tunnels, one of which lead to Skyshrine. In other tunnels were indifferent Faries and ULTRA agro nasty Goos. However deep in one of the tunnels we found some genoid creatures. These creatures were all made of stone. They were indifferent and upon hailing the named genoid (sorry cant recall it atm) He said that he sense we were  trying to communicate but we would have to learn the language of the stone in order to communicate with them. <br><br>Now, I have just got the Focus item. Hearing what Stonetooth says 'Ahhhh good work (ME). Now ta speak with the stone ye need something to focus on. Ta speak the language o the stone ye need ta  slow down like the stone. Rock looks like it dont move much but it does, just real slow. So place yer focus upon the stones ye wish to speak with and get yerself real slow, both yer body an yer noggin. Then if yer quiet enough ye might hear 'em. An thats whats to it.' Upon giving you the item leads me to believe that you must give this item to the named Genoid in a tunnel in Wakening Lands. <br><br>Also also following the story here, this is dealing with him mining velium. The Genoids communicate by thought, therefor are ultra smart! So I am going to assume this might be a quest for Enchant Velium spell.<br><br>I will take my guild there on thursday and see if this focus item really infact lets me talk to the genoid...I'll post my findings.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Harkon no longer asks for a chunk of vellium, he now asks for a small piece of vellium and a small block of vellium no longer counts.  I did find a small piece of vellium in Skyshrine yesterday, this will prolly work.  <br><br>It should be noted that the quest is actually solved, you get the Velium Focus item.  I just don't know what you do with it once you have it.  I suspect it is part of a larger quest, or is a key of some sort.
