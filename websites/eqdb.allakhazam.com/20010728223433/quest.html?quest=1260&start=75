It is also a drop, which is described in the related quest link.<br><br>Hail Ryshon Hunsti<br><br>Ryshon Hunsti says, 'Hello Kalerien. What brings you to the Karanas? Do you seek [enlightenment]?<br> <br>You say, 'I seek enlightenment'<br><br>Ryshon Hunsti says, 'Ahh, i could see by the look in your eyes that you are looking for something more than just enlightenment. Perhapsa you are looking for a [sword] crafted by a noble man.<br> <br>You say, 'what sword'<br><br>Ryshon Hunsti says, 'It is not just a sword friend. It is much more than that. This sword carries with it special [power], something unlike anything else within this realm.'<br> <br>You say, 'what power'<br><br>Ryshon Hunsti says, 'It is an instrument fashioned together by noble man. It is said to be blessed by the gods themselves. Only a man who comes from nobility may wield it. Do you seek the [sword of nobility]?'<br> <br>You say, 'I seek the sword of nobility'<br><br>Ryshon Hunsti says, 'I see, then take this note to Kanthuk Ogrebane. I've been told he can be found fishing not far from the dwarven city.'<br><br>Recieve a Note for Kanthuk, lore, nodrop, and unreadable.<br> <br>Travel to Butcherblock Mts to the boat docks. If you go around the wall on the north side to the shore line and follow that north you will find Kanthuk Ogrebane standing there.<br> <br>You say, 'Hail Kanthuk Ogrebane'<br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'Hello Kalerien'<br><br>Hand Kanthuk the note and get some experience.<br> <br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'Ahh, I see you have spoke to Ryshon. You seem tired from your long journey. Sit with me as I tell you a tale. A tale about a true friend of mine, a great man known as [Amstaf Trunolis].'<br> <br>You say, ' Who is amstaf trunolis'<br><br>Kanthuk ogrebane says, 'Amstaf Trunolis was a good man. I've followed into [battle] many times. We've seen many of our friends die by the sword of others.'<br> <br>You say, 'what battle'<br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane laughes, 'I remember the first time we charged into battle. I was so scared. My hands wouldn't stop trembling. Amstaf pulled me off to the side before<br>the initial attack began. He held my hands within his. I saw his hands begin to glow and felt his energy pass into me. I felt [courage].<br> <br>You say, 'what courage'<br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'I'll never forget what he did for me that day. He gave me the courage to continue. No one's ever done anything like that for me. I vowed that day that I'd follow him into any battle. I'd be there alongside him, no matter what. As time went on we came across an elven woman named [Ambreen].<br> <br>You say, 'who is ambreen'<br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'Ambreen was younger than he and I. She knew of the powers of nature. She was able to control the rain which fell from the heavens and would<br>call upon the spirits to aide her. It was obvious that Amstaf took a liking to Ambreen. She ended up coming with is on out crusades. The last I saw of Ambreen was when we went to the snow covered lands of Everfrost. We were wander the lands when a freak [snowstorm] hit us. We were seperated from one another for quite some time.'<br> <br>You say, 'what snowstorm' <br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'I don't know where it came from, but it was so sudden that it caught us all off guard. The snow quickly became unbearable. I tried to move to higher ground, but was unable to. I was stuck within the snowy confines. I didn't know what to do [next].'<br> <br>You say, 'what happened next'<br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'As I laid there my body began to slowly freeze. I knew death was near and accepted the inevitable. Suddenly I felt something clutching at my cloak. I was being dragged upwards out of the snow. A hand pressed against my chest and began to glow. I felt energy pass into my body. Do you know [how] he had saved me?'<br> <br>You say, 'how did he save you'<br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'He saved my life by laying his hands upon my body. A few moments later we found Ambreen lying in the snow, her body frozen by the harsh surroundings. We lifted her up off the ground and began to look for [shelter].'<br> <br>You say, 'what shelter'<br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'We ended up taking refuge within a deserted cabin not to far from our location. We knew that we didn't have much time left to bring life back into her body. However, the storm didn't pass through and we knew we couldn't venture to far without the fear of freezing. I warmed the cabin and rested for some time thinking about what we were going to do. It wasn't long before my exhaustion took over. I fell into a deep [slumber] that night.'<br> <br>You say, 'what slumber'<br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'That night I dreamt of many things. Random thoughts kept swirling around my mind. I kept seeing the image of a cloaked being and of Amstaf circled around a fire. I saw Ambreen's body convulsing above the fire as if life was being brought back to it. I don't know what happened that night. I don't even know if what i dreamt was real, but before I awoke I saw a [strange image].'<br> <br>You say, 'waht strange image'<br><br>Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'I saw Amstaf lower his head and walked away in silence. He was surronded by two beings carrying a torch. I don't know what it meant, but I swear it was so real. When I awoke both Amstaf and Ambreen were gone. Please find Llara and give this pendant to her. This pendant belonged to Amstaf. She too had a vision that night that may clear things up. If she asks where you got it from, mention my name.' <br><br>You Recieve a pendant, magic, lore, nodrop, +1cha, pal only, hum hie dwf eru<br><br>Next you need to find Llara.  She is standing on a rock outside of Unrest.<br><br>Llara says 'Oh my! This belongs to Amstaf. Where did you get it? <br><br>You say, 'kanthuk gave it to me'<br><br>Llara says 'I take it you're here to find out more about [Amstaf].' <br><br>You say, 'Who was Amstaf?'<br><br>Llara says 'I've known Amstaf since he was a child. We grew up in the same city together. Ever since I've known him there's always been something [unusual] about him.' <br><br>You say, 'What was unusual?'<br><br>Llara says 'When we were growing up we used to venture outside the city gates. Some times we would encounter a wandering ghoul or an undead spirit of some sort. He was always able to quickly dismiss the undead being with very little effort. I [learned] many things growing up with Amstaf.' <br><br>You say, 'What did you learn?'<br><br>Llara says 'Amstaf told me many things when we were younger. Once Amstaf told me that life isn't about how you get there, it's about where you end up. I miss my dear friend. Its been a long time since I've seen him. The night of the snowstorm I dreamt about him. I remember seeing Amstaf's face. I saw something I've never [seen] before.'<br><br>You say, 'What did you see?'<br><br>Llara says 'I saw desperation. I spoke to many people who knew Amstaf trying to find out if anyone heard anything about that night. No one knew anything about it. When I had reached the dwarven hunting grounds I ran into a woman named Walnan. She kept rambling on and on about the power of the Orb and something about Magi`kot. I didn't understand what she was saying. She didn't know anything about my situation either, but she did tell me that there were others that may be able to help me. She told me that I should find [Ruathey].' <br><br>You say, 'Who is Ruathey?'<br><br>Llara says 'Ruathey is known for her ability to look into people's souls and find truth. Though I wasn't able to find Amstaf, I was able to recover his sword. I believe that by having his sword I am closer to finding him. Take this note to Ruathey and tell her that I sent you. <br><br>Next you find Ruathey she is in Lavastorm, near the Nek zone -- a little to the west<br><br>You say, 'Hail Ruathey'<br><br>Ruathey says 'Hello Chork .' <br><br>Ruathey says 'I see that you've spoken to Llara. She too came to me looking for Amstaf. Though she wasn't able to find her friend, she was able to recover his [sword]. <br><br>You say, 'What sword?'<br><br>Ruathey says 'I've heard stories about a holy sword. There are many rumored to be hidden all throughout the world, yet only a few have actually been found. Amstaf had one of these swords. It is known for its ability to dismiss the undead. Perhaps by having this sword it'll bring you closer to finding your friend. Gather a ghoul's heart, Amstaf's Scroll, the Blade of Nobility, a noblemans hilt and place them in this [bag].' <br><br>You say, 'What bag?'<br><br>Ruathey says 'Take this bag and gather the items I've mentioned. I've been told that the Ghoul's Heart can be found in the estate of the undead, while the scroll can be found in the Keep not far from the Karanas. One of the others are rumored to be found near the dwarven city among the goblins. While the last should be found in the caverns of Najena. <br><br>For those of you who haven't figured it out, you will need to go to ButcheBlock, HighKeep, Unrest, and Najena.<br><br>Your target is Crazed Ghouls in unrest<br><br>Your target is Crazed Goblins (possibly Goblin Thieves too) in HighKeep<br><br>Your target is high level skeletons in Najena (right inside zone past first skel)<br><br>And there is a small ruins that was previoulsy uninhabited, but now has goblins and crazed goblins in Butcherblock, the loc is Pos 1300 Neg 1500<br><br>All the mobs that need to be killed are 25 to up to 35, and the items appear to be uncommon drops.<br><br>You combine these 4 items in the bag Ruathey give you and  You have fashioned the items together to create something new!<br><br>You are holding a Ghoulbane<br><br>(The quest may continue from here, or this may just be an alternative way to get Ghoulbane)</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A word, please. I always hear that paladins are supposed to be like the most "saintly" class in the game. Judging by the fact that about the evilest god they can worship is Brell (who owns the Erollisi twins anyday IMHO) I would assume this is true. Now, forgive me if i'm wrong, but why are such good souls bitching so horribly? If you're any kind of paladin you'll sit down, shut up and wait for your turn just like any good or mature person would do. Now, you guys in this forum are the only guys i've seen so far with a problem, I didn't even do this quest on purpose really, I just saved a newbies arse from a crazed ghoul in Unrest and decided to do the stupid quest since I already had the mofo's heart, and that newbie certainly didn't mind being spared. It's not like the spawns are really that rare either, theres about five spawns in Unrest which are never in short supply.<br>Oh, and for those of you complaining about the price going down cause so many people are getting em. . . what in blazes are you whining about? If you're doing the quest yourself to get rich, you're not helping the problem yourself. If you're a paladin doing the quest, why would you care about the price?! You're doing the quest to get it!! And, finally, to those of you wanting to buy one, OMFG you guys have the least reason to care at all, you're gonna be getting it for cheaper! NOW STOP YER WHINING you remind me of a bunch of newbie dark elves whose bridge guards are being killed!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

This quest actually took me longer because one of the npc's was missing, other than the boat rides this quest is extremely fast. Most of the people killing the mobs with the quest items always let you loot the quest items, especially if your a pal. I would recommend doing the quest, even just to give a pally the sword for free, yes the quest is that easy.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This quest has been bugging the heck out of me lately as I try to figure it out. I have received the Ghoulbane, but I don't think this is the end of the quest. The pieces of the quest just don't fit together:<br><br>- Ryshon, who gives the quest, talks about how the sword is "unlike anything else in this realm" and "blessed by the gods themselves." I guess this COULD fit the description of Ghoulbane, but then there's more...<br><br>- Taia in Lake Rathe tells you that Amstaf (I'm guessing this is who she means) was killed on one of his crusades. Is this supposed to be the end of the story? Or is there more (I couldn't get her to say any more).<br><br>- Taia also tells about the "nobleman who held a sword of immense power."<br><br>- Llara tells you that she has Amstaf's sword.<br><br>The thing that really bugs me about this quest is the fact that many people talk about how mighty and powerful the sword is. If it is so powerful, and "blessed by the gods," why does a Froglok hold the same sword? And if Llara has it, why don't you go back to her for it? Llara also spoke of Walnan (the girl for the mage epic in Butcherblock). Maybe she can tell you more? I ran across Taia Layfol in Lake Rathe by accident, but I am sure she is a part of this quest. Is her only reason for being there to tell you that Amstaf is dead? Then what happened to Ambreen?  What Ruathey says has "Ghoulbane" printed all over it, but the others are very vague.<br><br>Incomplete quest, or Verant mess-up? Does anybody else have any other information they can add? <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have several characters in their teens and low 20's. Unrest and Najena were nice dungeons at these levels, until Verant added the crazed ghoul in the entrance and yard of Unrest and the skeletons at the entrance and all over Najena.<br><br>Both crazed ghouls and skeletons are at least 10 levels higher than the other mobs in the same areas. And having a spawn right at the entrance doesn't even allow me to enter these dungeons without them attacking me. Believe me, if you are level 14 and come to hunt yard trash in Unrest, you don't want to get hit by a crazed ghoul the second you zone in.<br><br>While the situation was bad immediately after they placed the new mobs, it has become much better now, thanks to the farmers. I've never seen so many people in Najena before. And having somebody sit and camp the entrance tunnel of Unrest was also something I saw for the first time yesterday. The live expectancy of the crazed ghouls and skeletons has become low enough that lower level characters can enter these dungeons again.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Amazing the results. I have assisted several pallies this way much to the DISMAY of farmers who shout how much they dislike me.<br><br>2] Once I completed my GB quest, I stayed at the unrest and camped crazed ghouls.  NICE EXP and loot....almost non-stop action.  If a Pally comes looking for a heart, I let him join the group and he loots.  Now, I can't get ALL the crazed ones...but I can surely slow down a farmer's progress.<br><br>3]  Same as two but in ButcherBlock.  Here, a 34 lvl monk with an alt pally has been helping me camp this area.  NICE exp again and nice loot.  Almost from 29-30 in 6 hours...not great....but not bad..especially little risk(close to guards) and EASY access to vendors and a bank.  Again, pally comes looking, we let them loot.<br><br>That is what I have been doing to help my fellow paladins out.  Control the spawns and inform those in the dark.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The Frogloks are a good race. Therefore an SK killing the Shin Lord for the sword would be legit. They made the quest for the Ghoulbane because of constant complaints to verant that its too hard to get off the Shin Lord because of the rarity in which it drops and that it's always farmed. And, killing Frogloks in Upper Guk also ruins beta neutral faction for Paladins because the Frogloks are a Good race and faction.<br><br>I don't think SK should have to quest for the item and they can't quest for it the way it is done now because any SK if they did not ruin their own faction are KOS to almost all the NPC's involved in the quest.<br><br>Just my 2 copper<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>     I have to agree with the few people that have stated that Quest items for CLASS SPECIFIC gear Should be NO DROPS. I agree 100%. Unless your a friend of a paladin thats another class, or a paladin that already has this sword or needs one aswell, or a guild member helping a paladin out, WHY are you farming for this item to make money? YES, Dont buy this weapon from someone selling it. That will lower the price and maybe even eliminate the sale of the weapon all together! Then only Paladins, or *snorts* (hehe, no offense SKs) ShadowKnights will be questing for this item as they should. BTW, I agree that ShadowKnights should have to kill a Paladin in GUK for this sword, its more their nature, prehaps Verant should make that the SK quest to get this sword, or make a new quest just for SKs to get this sword. <br>     I dont have a problem with quests for items that almost anyone can use being sold, or selling components that you happen to loot that noone needed in a party, cause you earned them an others might be able to benefit from buying them from you. But, selling class specific gear when your not that class shows a lack of character (the player), and that you got nothing better to do then farm other classes items to make a buck and get rich of them. WHAT happen to the SPIRIT of REALLY roleplaying? NO honorable paladin should buy this wepaon, its a quest! Think of it as a right of passage. Your proving to yourself, your order, your god, and yes, your guild (if you have one) that you deserve to walk the way of a paladin, a Noble, honorable knight who helps those in need, and is a unyeilding enemy of evil. I have played paladins many times myself in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1 of the popular fads that is one of the reasons rpgs have become so famous and spawned games such is EverQuest, Ultima Online, Diablo, etc). Though I myself am a Ranger, I would NEVER sell my Ranger specifc gear to another ranger, it would be dishonorable to do so! Rather, I'd help a fellow ranger in their quest for say, The Ivy Ethced Gear (when I get some myself eventually *lol*). Or, I'd pass it down to a ranger that I befriended as a gift (if verant insists on keeping class specific quest items no drop) cause I feel they earned it. BUT, I do feel that ALL QUEST ITEMS should be No Drop, and that all the Quest NPCs for the class specific gear should only devulge the information to one of that class, it only makes sense. WHY would, for example, a Ranger like myself be able to get information about a ShadowKnight only item and THEN be able to complete the quest and keep it to sell it? I should not be able to complete the quest at all, why would such... shady characters speak to me and tell me anything? They should'nt. Im sure this post is gonna spark some people to think im whinning, or they themselves would whine. BUT, again, if your out hunting for this item only to selll it, your nothing other then a straight up merchant that wants to take advantage of others. These kind of PC merchants are the ones RUINING EverQuest! Let people Earn their class specific gear, let them earn their strips. As for, this Quest being HARD, as someone said in a number of posts down below, who was complaining its such a long jurney back and forth. Hey, thats part of quests sometimes. To venture into far off places, facing danger to fulfill a goal, and in the end, being rewarded for it, and then feeling Good that YOU ACCOMPLISHED something. You should feel PROUD to have completed this quest. Taking boat rides and long walks. Oh, and one last thing... Low Level players are NOT suppossed to get gear like this right away. Thats ALSO the point, there are quests for other gear for your class, or items that almost anyone else can use at lower levels. Your going thru the ranks, so.. TAKE YOUR TIME. Rushing only ruins the fun of the normal progression of this game. This is'nt an action based game, its an RPG, things are SUPPOSSED to be slow. If you dont understand that, then you really should learn patience, or, just stop playing rpgs. Thats my 2 coppers worth.<br><br>" May the Mother of All watch over and keep you safe "<br>&nbsp;<br>Aarun Moonblade <br>&lt;Legends of Marr&gt; <br>Wood Elf of Kelethin <br>33 Season Ranger of Tunare</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well written and i agree completely.  I never thought about having the NPC only give info to the appropriate class. exellent idea.  i would also like to see the quest item istelf no drop. that would stop farming dead in it's tracks.  when my wizzy turned lvl 29, he could group port and could make a little money from porting.  some folks pay, some don't but on average i could do well money wise by porting.  by the time i moved up a few levels i was by no means rich, but i could afford to buy any item appropriate for my level. however i didn't.  it took a little time and work, but i quested for, looted a corpse myself or my group killed, or tailored myself every item my wizard has in his inventory.  I don't have the best items in the game, but I have earned every piece on me.  How many lvl 15 warriors sporting a wurmslayer in one hand and a ssoy in the other can say that?  Bottom line, it seems that making the class specific items no drop, and allowing the quest npc speak only to a class that could use the item will at least slow down some of the farming and twinking.  <br><br><br>OK twinks,  go ahaead and start whining and crying about these posts.<br><br>Zeddicous,  Wizard of the 46th circle<br>Quellious<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Helm of the tracker can't be done unless you are 55+ ranger of Tunare, same deal, not a 55+ ranger of Tunare no quest for you. So yes VI can restrict quests to classes, lvl, and religon.
