	   <tr><td colspan=2>Disclaimer: this is a partial spoiler, if you enjoy the thrill of exploration it might not be a good idea to read this. <br><br> Mistmore is a very dangerous zone with very nice experience and descent loot. It is a castle of vampires, completly equipped with anything you'd expect in a castle, a large courtyard, a front gate, a jail, a graveyard, a crypt and various other areas left unexplored by many.<br><br> I have hunted here from levels 20 to 30, and plan to until I have explored everything. I cant remember the amount of times ive died but the experience is excellent with a well balanced group.<br><br> People around lev 20 should stay in the front yard with the pool and maybe even pull from the tunnel sometimes. Its important to get in the corner, the hill or the zone line as trains of certain death will run around from time to time due to inexperienced pulls in the castle or the graveyard.<br> <br> People from 25 to 28 should hunt in the graveyard. This can be one of the safest places in the entire zone with a group that can single pull, deal a lot of damage or heal well. There are three apparent areas where pairs glyphed things spawn. If you break them up it can be real easy to stay alive. The best way to start in the gy is to invis and come out ontop of a pair of glyph's, then simply kill those two and then move on to the others, being careful not to step too far away from the wall. The glyphed warders and custodians heal so be sure to take them out first and stun or nuke them before they can get heals off. Ive seen one of these guys last a real long time, pretty tough if you let them heal.<br><br> The most fun, exp and danger is for those from levels 28 to 36. The places to hunt are the canyon (across from the gate of the graveyard), the jail (through false wall in far left of gy) and the castle itsself (through false wall just to the left of blocked door in jail). <br> The easiest of the three by far is the jail. The 3 jail doors are opened by using one door on the far wall. The things inside the cells themselves cannot move out of them, this makes them easy to kill. The thing to fear here are the casters who often cast spells hitting up to 300 in a single shot. Be sure to stun or mez these guys. Also some of them cast a damage shield on themselves that hurts reel bad so debuff them if you can. Most melee types are easy, if you take too mush damage just back off a bit, but make sure you leave someone outside to open the cells. Its not good to be trapped in there :).<br> The canyon is about as tough as the castle. The best way to start fighting here is to invis and run all the way to the back where the wolves are. Note: DO NOT touch the wolves, ive never seen them cos but they hit for 200dmg+ really fast, it would take a LOT to take them down , im talking lev 50's. SO at the wolves uninvis and you'll be fighting Enti(?, low lev fighter) and 2 lower type of gargs. Shouldn't be too hard if you have a good group. Next single pull things outside or is you must pull and mez. It would be really hard to take on more than two of these at once however. The things here are the same that are found in jail. If your group is really good and can single pull using monks feign death or some other method, the next place to pull from is the castle gates which are up the ramp in the canyon, this is very dangerous though.<br> The last place is the castle its self, the most deadly opponents come out of here. By following the stairs up and to the left you get to the torture chamber. Beware because you will most likely get cast upon before even touching the door, ouch, these casters hurt, as a monk I die really quick up here. Be sure you move your entire group quickly up the stairs, go left, open the door and bust in there and start tearing up some vampires, mezzing them or healing like crazy, otherwise people will get fried. Note: in emergency situations go right at the top of the steps ,jump off the bridge, you will land in the front yard again; be sure to pray you dont get fried on the way. After this room is taken The best thing to do is pull two gargs from the garg room, which is down the hall deeper into the castle. Move your group there, then invis up and move down to the second garg chamber. Too bad I forgot the way, but its downstairs and be sure not to go through false walls where it looks like there should be a door. Bad stuff back there. In the second garg room there will be downward stairs, warn everyone not to go down there. Down the stairs and through a false wall you will pull lots of bad stuff without invis, even some stuff there can see through invis so don't get cocky. One time I was in a group of 30's a wizard, shamen, enchanter, warrior, monk and necro. Our warrior wanted to explore so he went down the stairs, a few seconds later, 4 people were dead, one was lucky enough to gate and I was feigning death while a ton of red casters and gargs looked over me. They never moved so I had to FD move a little FD again and pray that it worked, I eventually made it to the bridge jumped off and ran like crazy to the zone. The real problem was when we tried to retrieve corpses from so deep in the castle, we got cocy with invis and my FD didn't work. More deaths: Mission failed. Eventually one of us had to train the entire castle out and get the corpses before they could get back in place. So be careful in there and don't scout around unless you have invis and FD or some other method of concealment. With a well oiled group you can move from GY to jail to TC to garg1 to garg2 and complete the cycle multiple times, gaining excellent experience at 30. <br>  <br>  Mistmore is usually near empty, not many people have the courage to venture into its depths. The experience and loot(fs, ringmail and 1pp or more on the majority of monsters) is excellent, but the risk is often not worth it without a well balanced group including at least one ranger, druid, enchanter, cleric or paladin. And of course one tank. Hopefully, this information will equip you with the knowlege you need to survive in this zone. I have seen countless high and low level people who instead of slowly testing the zone out run in, start fighting and die very fast. Be careful and take it slow at first.<br><br>Lestaparis Mushin<br>30th monk<br>Vallon Zek <br><br>   <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The grave yard is thought to be a 5 spawn camp with an occasional rare spawn in the back corner.  This approach can make it dangerous.  The gy acctually has 8 spawns.  The first five are obvious.  The best place to set up camp is behind the grave stones by the single spawn.  Controlling the sixth spawn is the key to controlling the gy.  It has been said, "Don't attack the roamers," and rightly so, they are ghosts, they could pull other mobs if attacked.<br>   The key is to know where the ghost actually is.  The sixth (ghost) spawn is HIGH above the gate to the gy.  It falls down after a few minutes and appears to walk accross the gy.  This mob can and should be attacked while it is still in the air.  <br>   After the songle spawn and the double spawn oposite the camp site are dead, target the mob high above the gate and cast on it, then run back to the grave stones, this mob will not run to you, it will just appear on top of you in a few seconds.<br>   The seventh spawn is a roamer who appears to travle toward the gate, this mob will not attack, nor can it be attacked, it will however join in when it sees you are killing its kin, so be prepaired, it has the same spawn rate as the rest of the mobs there, so plan out the break accordingly.<br>   The eighth spawn is the rare spawn in the back corner near the floating book.  Also be aware that the avenging cantiff is a rare spawn that spawns in the small room between the gy and the jail.  This mob is higher lvl than those in the gy, but not a hard kill. It drops crested (nice) armor.<br>   With my knowledge of the gy I am able to solo it as a lvl 34 ranger until there is a roaming spawn that is a healer (ouch).  I would recommend the gy be taken by a group of 3-5 lvls 28-33<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

So a Ranger (assumed that since you were looking for Etched Ivy) would be hard pressed to melee whatever is in there.

If no more than 1 of those 3 stationary ones (the ones behind the doors) are casters (you can pull the other one at your will), then u can sit back and nuke that ONE silly while the other 2 watch.  then pick a target and blow them senseless.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Took me a while to get around to this, but here is part 2 of my three part post on Castle Mistmoore.<br><br>Today we are going to talk about the Canyon, the Entrance area to the Castle, the Negotiator's Room, the Ballroom, and the Maid and Butler quarters.<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Everything I talk about today is aimed for people level 29 and up. Most of these things are deadly and account for 95% of the trains that occur.<br><br>The Canyon: All Mobs here are of high 20s to low 30s in level. You can reach this area by going the same route to the Graveyard but instead of turning right and going through the gate, you turn left and head down the passageway. When you get to the landing before it takes a sharp right, you should stop. If you plan on clearing out the Canyon so you can move to the back (where it's relatively safe), do so here. A single person with the spell Harmony is preferred here, but if you don't have one of those make sure you have an enchanter. Most of the Mobs in this area are linked with a few others so if you don't have a Hamrony puller expect company. You have your standard MM array of tough Warrior mobs mixed with the annoying Caster Mobs. I beleive (and correct me if I am wrong) that you will only find Necromancers in this area. I beleive (never got a true count) that there is roughly between 6 to 10 Mobs in the canyon, including a named which I will list later. If you manage to clear out the canyon, you may wish to head to the back of it so you can avoid any trains that come out of the castle.<br><br>Castle Entrance: When you reach the canyon, off to your left will be a ramp leading up. Follow it and you will come to the Castle Entrance area which I break up into two parts, outside and inside. Outside you have roughly 4 mobs to deal with, and they are the standard mix. You might get all four as warriors (have seen that before) but more than likely you will get a caster or two. Again, best way to clear outside is by use of Harmony so you can isolate. Once you clear the four outside you can get the inside ones. Two of the previous Mobs guarded a bridge, and two more guard the other end, just past a small gate. I have never seen these two as anything other than casters but you may get lucky. Once you clear these you can actually enter the castle but we are not done just yet. When you enter there may be a single roamer, if you see him, aggro and run outside. Fighting him inside can bring down the house if you know what I mean, unless you kill him quick. OK, once you enter the castle, head left, not right, LEFT. The right side is the path whioh every Mob in the castle takes on it's way out. If you take the left path you should be safe (as safe as you can be in one of the most dangerous zones in the game). The area you come to is the Main Hallway and is the final portion of the Castle entrance. In here we have but two Mobs, a couple of gargoyles. Harmony and Kill and you are done.<br><br>Negotiator's Room: You can reach this room by going through the center of the Main Hallway and taking a left to the end of that hall and opening the door. WARNING! This is the most dangerous room in the Castle as far as I am concerned. In it you have two very dangerous mobs that are surrounded by a deadly array of the standard fair (most still conned blue to me at level 45). The things in here can also see invis. Ok, first you have The Negotiator followed by the Gypsy Ambassador. The Negotiator is an Enchanter Mob (and thankfully the only one in the zone) and can decimate an unprepared group. Add in the other elements of the room and you are in for one of the toughest battles of your life. The thing that really makes this a room to hate is that considering it's toughness, nothing except the standard loot drops occur. So much for risk and reward. Also this room seems to be linked with...<br><br>The Ballroom: Another dangerous room but not as dangerous as the Negotiator's room. You can reahc this one simply by going htrough the middle of the Main Hallway and taking a right then following the opening immediately to your left. If you see gypsy musicians you are in the right place. If you come to a door, you have gone too far. NOTE: Occasionally when you fight here a few things from the other one will fight as well but only if you fight on the right side of the room. In here you have Gypsy Musicians and a named spawn as well as the standard fair. I think about 6 to 10 Mobs inhabit this room but it was real easy for a level 48 Ranger and myself, a 45 Mage, to clear the entire room without aggroing the whole castle. Granted not everyone will have that advantage but the info is there for you to use. There is a special interest in this room which I will discuss later.<br><br>Maid and Butler Quarters: This is one of the prime hunting areas for the low 30s in the zone and is of special interest for Rangers (discussed later :) ) You can get to this area as if you were going to the Negotiator's room but right before the door, immediately to your right is a secret passageway. Follow it to the end and you bypass the Negotiator's room entirely. Hang a left and go all the way down the hall and then hang a right. Hug the left wall all the way to the end and the door that is there is the Entrance to the Maid's Room. There are two Mobs inside, the one on the right side of the room is the PH for the Maid. If you go out this room and take the passageway to the left you will come across the door the Butler's Room. Again, 2 Mobs and the PH this time is on the right. Outside the Maids room and down the hall a bit is another door to your left. This is the Kitchen which spawns the Ancille Cooks, who are SKs and will HT you for an obsurd amount of damage. Another 3 to 4 mobs inhabit this room as well. People hunting the Maid and Butler generally pull this room as well.<br><br>Special interests:<br><br>In the back of the Canyon is a Named Mob called Enynti. He drops an item needed for an enchanter quest.<br><br>All gargoyles in the castle have a chance to drop MM granite which is used in Paladin Quest armor.<br><br>The Ballroom has two items of interest. A named Gypsy spawns in here called Mynthi Davissi who drops Lute of the Gypsy Princess (common) and Mistmoore Battle Drums (rare). Also the regular musicians have tow forms: Regular and werewolf ("Where wolf?" /em point "There wolf.") The regular drops a gypsy lute used for Bard quest armor. The werewolves drop a werewolf talon used for Warrior quest armor. Werewolves only spawn at night.<br><br>The Ancille Cooks in the kitchen drop Mistmoore Cauldrens which are used in Paladin quest armor.<br><br>The Maid drop a Nightshade Wreath (+5 int, +5 wis, AC:1) (common) and a tooth (rare). The tooth is one of two needed (the other is from the butler) for the Electrum Bladed Wakizashi which is used for the Ranger level 50 spell quest. It's also a decent weapon being 7DMG/21DLY.<br><br>The Butler drops a Cape of Midnight Mist (common) and a tooth (rare). See above for the tooth.<br><br>Also, at night the normal caster mobs will spawn as Vampire (they are hunched over females with white pasty skin). They see invis but are subject to all Undead type spells (Paladin's grease up the GB).<br><br>I think that is it. Also, if you form a train, know where you are going before you run. This place is known for lengthy CRs. If you are going to run I suggest, as a caster, to jump off the bridge leading to the castle and running for the crypt in the Graveyard. Open the crypt and drop down the sides, wait 2 seconds and cast Gate. Otherwise I suggest running to the zone. Oh and if you don't have SoW expect to die. Most of the Mobs run as fast as jboots. Ok that's it.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First, the correction--the name of the items dropped for the paladin Breastplate of Ro quest off the ancille cooks are "a dark cauldron".  You'll need two, so, good luck.  The kitchen has, of late, had its spawn timer re-set to about 45 minutes (approximately two spawns of the butler/maid rooms, which are 20-25 minutes each).  Two ancille cooks spawn in the kitchen, and, of the six that our party met (and toasted), four had the cauldrons.  I and the other paladin on the trip were happy as a pair of armored clams.<br><br>Now, the warning.  I have to say, without reservation, that the kitchen area is probably about the most difficult area to reach on the entire map.  I mean, I could almost solo Mayong himself and have a greater chance of surviving than getting back to the kitchen consistently.  The problem lies with the configuration and population of the three rooms separating the grand hall from the kitchen/butler/maid area--namely, the piano room, the ballroom, and the ambassador room.  Each of them are choked with mobs (6 or 7, each about 32nd-36th level), and, if you pull one, you've pulled them all.  Invis would normally do wonders for you, were it not for the fact that occasionally, in place of a DE spawn (like a deathly usher or deathly harbinger), you'll get a vampire.  And that's the one mob you'll end up pulling.<br><br>Now, there doesn't seem to be a clear rule as to either (1) when the vampires spawn or (2) how to avoid them, but my group knew of, and used the secret passage mentioned in the root thread to get back to the kitchen.  First time, one of our members ended up in the ambassador room by mistake.  Train.  Second time, though, was me returning from showing our tank the way out, both of us invis.  I run past the arch to the ballroom to the passage, hugging the left wall--boom, there's now a will pillager in the ballroom, and she pulls the whole room on me.  I must have dragged 3/4's of the zone out to Lesser Fay.<br><br>The best solution I can think of is to have your druid/ranger track and check for vamps ahead of you. If s/he doesn't see any, go invis and run in.  Excelsior!<br><br>--Edmund<br>&nbsp;<br>"Here is a purse of monies...which I'm not going to give to you."</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sorry about that post below, my #%&%!#* keyboard stuck and I missed putting in the N.<br>Anyways...<br>First off, the discription above is wrong, As a new player in MM, the zone holds almost no undead creatures.  Later on, in the graveyard area as well as some others and at night there are more undead.  <br>Now, if you haven't heard it already, MM is a zone for trains.  Of the three newbie areas, the zone ent, the hill, and the corner (these being around lvl 18-25) trains will pretty much hit all of them, but will for sure go through the zone ent, and most likely hit the corner.  If you are a low level, or don't feel fond of dying, or are already engaged with numerous mobs, when you hear the yell of TRAIN!!! zone as quickly as you can manage.  Those more adept at playing in MM or unengaged in combat, can usually take a quick glance to assess the need to run.  If you are in a good group, MM can be a great and safe place to lvl.  Also, an enchater is a great party member to have here, not only for a mana helping breeze, but more so for the need for their crowd control.  Other classes will do, but enchaters have the best ability in this area.<br>Some of the loot dropped here can make player rich, in a fairly short period of time, as well as gaining good exp.  As longs as you watch for trains, and don't overpull, MM can be a great zone to hunt.<br>Gedran<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>you're probably not going to like this answer, but as a 29 pally, your shot at camping the MM granite is low.<br><br>The mobs that drop it are Leering, Jeering, and Flouting Gargoyles, of which the minimum one is about lvl 30... and they mostly reside in the castle.  Every so often, a jeering will spawn in the Cave near the EEntyi spawn, but I have never seen this any more than 2 times in a 6-hour stretch; more usually, 1 every 6 hours.  With about a 1/4 drop chance per gargoyle, we are talking a LONG wait down there. <br><br>Unless you are part of a large group, or someone else kills one and offers the loot to the zone, you are going to have to lvl for a while to pick up that stone.<br><br>On the other hand, since the post you made says you might be living here for a while, go ahead and make the most of it.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This place is great! OK, so you have trains and unfortunatly with the way the zone is designed you better pray you know your way around if somehting bad happens, but overall this is one of the best exp places to hunt hands down.<br><br>Here's the skinny:<br><br>You can first come here at level 19 but it is recommended that you wait until you are level 20, especially if you are a caster. Level 20 spells help a bunch. At level 20 you must get into a group. This is not an option if you wish to survive. You will only hunt in the Courtyard area killing Initiates and Familiars. Every spawn here in the Courtyard is a two spawn. They are never alone so if you can bring a Druid or Ranger do so and have them use harmoney to make things easier. You can hunt in the Courtyard until level 27 when things start greening out, but some of them will still spawn blue so in a pinch you can always group up there or solo. Soloing is not recommended because of the Train situation (more on this later).<br><br>At level 25 or 26 you can think about moving on in MM, so keep an eye out for Graveyard groups. This area has 5 spawns total and two of them are double spawns. Most people set up where the single spawn is, directly to the right of the GY gate. The GY is good exp until low 30s. Be careful here. There is a ghost that walks through here that is usually a low-level sentry or guard, but never attack him cause he WILL disappear and he WILL bring out the entire castle to wipe you out. Also, people train stuff through the GY from the upper portion of the castle. When this happens, best bet is to go into the crypt and drop down on the sides of it. There is a false floor with a room underneath it. I have found this to be the ONLY relatively safe place in the whole dungeon. No roamers come through here and unless you aggroed something nothing will ever come down. You can get out by going up the ramp and hugging the left wall. You'll hit three false walls and end up in the back of the GY, behind the tomb.<br><br>Once you feel tired of the GY or if you lose the people needed to hold it well, if you have a couple of level 30ish people in the group you can head over to the Jail area and hunt there. Remember where you dropped down at if there was a train in the GY? Well do the same here and that area is your setup place. For mages and necros: No pets in this place. Too much goes wrong. OK, when you go up the ramp you go through a false wall and you'll see four doors. The one immediately to your right is the only one that opens and when you do that it'll open all three of the other doors. If the MoBs inside aren't casters you can pick them off easily with a caster of your own or simply engage and back off if things get hectic. You have three total mobs here and one roamer who is the PH for a named spawn (later on this). When you do this area you can also do the Torture Room. Here's how to get to that: Immediately left to the door that opens in the Jail is a false wall that will take you to some stairs. Follow them all the way up and immediately to you left is a door. Open it and the two mobs inside will aggro and follow you back down to the group. Most things here and in the Jail are blue to a 36 and still good exp. You can do the jail area with three people, with four you can do the TR too and with a full group you may want to do the GY as well.<br><br>Special interests: The Courtyard has a random spawn called the Glyphed Ghoul. He drops Vial of Vampire Blood (common) and a Crested Mistmoore Shield (rare). If he has the shield you will see it. It's very nice and my level 40 paladin mate still uses it. The blood is a one time use Magic Resist potion.<br><br>The Graveyard has a spawn called the Imp Familiar. He is quite rare and I have only seen him three times in all the times I camped the GY. He drops the Sacrificial Dagger (common) and the Bloodstone Eyepatch (rare). Dagger is +5 int and can be sold for about 300-400pp. The Eyepatch is something like a +3wis but only goes for 200pp or so because it really is a weak item.<br><br>Next to the Jail area there is a roamer. This is the Placeholder for the Avenging Caitiff (AKA the Cat). He is used for a quest but more often than not he is killed because he drops Crested Spaulders (common) and a Crested Helm (rare). The Spaulders are really nice and before Kunark were the second best in the game. They can be sold for about 150pp. The Helm is even nicer and goes for about 800pp.<br><br>FINAL WORD: Ok, trains here are deadly! This is called Trainmore by many people (myself included) and unless you are in a full group of 40+ expect all trains to give you problems. Hell, I have been in 40+ groups and we've had to zone it was so bad. If someone yells train and you are near the zone, then zone. Don't stop to heal or anything, just zone. Also, for some strange reason, every once in a while a Courtyard mob will haul arse into the castle area when someone nukes it. I have done this and seen it happen. What comes afterwards is not pretty and most of the time it ends up with a train for the record books. If you see a courtyard mob do this, zone. Don't think about it, zone. Tell you group you'll explain afterwards. They'll thank you later.<br><br>Ok, it's late so this comcludes part 1 of my 2cp on MM. Later.<br><br>"May Valor be your Virtue"<br>- Ignitz Gemcaller<br>Guildmaster, Heroes of Valor<br>Tribunal Server<br>&nbsp;<br>- Ignitz Gemcaller<br>53rd Season Magician<br>Tribunal Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>well, whoeversaid going in front was easier must have beeb level 55. I have never seen afront break in work. Terer is aroom off of the righthand staircase that, if aggroed at all, will not come through that door, but will go around through advisor room and BR then to the foyer. They will train the wholeupstairs in. This happened every single time more than one group has hit this place that I was in the zone.<br>My main advice is keeo the raid manageable: 2 to 3 groups max. here is kind of our major raid lessons learned from here.<br><br>Several things I saw that we ned to be careful of doing on our raids. <br><br>1) is pay attn. Group leaders and Raid leader call directions in shout. If even one person is busy or not paying attn to a direction it can kill everybody. this pretty much means not to get involved in tells during a raid.<br><br>2) Once a camp is set up and broken it should not be left. Rezes should be done at camp. Even draggin one or 2 corpses to zone for rez will make a whole new break in needed.<br><br>3) DON'T RUN! If somebody is hurt, stand and die. You will get a rez. Running causes trains.<br><br>4) If one whole group in raid is ded or AFK, dont pull. you might get something bigger than was expected and kill everybody.<br><br>5) Dont take short cuts. Just because you know a way that one or 2 people were ablt to get into a dungeon doesnt mean 30 people can sneak by smae place. The break in points are outlined by way too many people who have tried it and people who knmow those dungeons well.<br><br>7) relays to (2): dont bring along people who arent team players. if somebody wants to, say sit at the zone and just rez, but doesnt want to really be part of raid, say thanks for offer, but we will be ok. Raids are a team effort.<br><br> expect to die. no explanation needed.<br>9) WATCH WHERE YOU MED. Sitting is a big agro (it increases the range mobs will agro on you). Sitting next to a wall can agro mobs in the room next door to you can cause a train to come in and eat the party. Remember an agroed mob running through a zone to get to you will pick up any friends it finds along the way. So if you dont need to med don't sit, if you need to med you might ask whether it is safe to do or do it in the middle of a group or something. <br><br>10) HAVE FUN<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

That is almost always suicide due to the sheer number of guards, the agro, and bad pathing.<br><br>Go invis to the area outside the bridge, all the way on the left against the back wall is the safespot... Careful as you might fall off.  Have a druid/ranger harmo pull to make that spot safe.<br><br>check the time, as long as its no later then 4pm camo/invis up and head into the castle.<br><br>Head through the foyer, go left, take the hidden passage and then goto the servants quarters.<br><br>Start in the Butlers room.  Clear it, pull the hall into the room clear that.<br>Then invis up and goto the Maids room.  Clear it and then the crap infront of it in the hall.  BTW if you have no heavy nukers use root, if you got a wizzie/magi or a druid who likes his Cale use snare.<br><br>The kitchen is last to be done because you wont have to worry bout the wanderers.  Head in Invis so the tanks can get next to the Cooks (SK's 300ish HT each).<br><br>The drop on the pots just is horrible, be ready to camp a long time as the spawn is slow as well.  Its best to do all 3 rooms if you can since you'll have the time.<br><br>It can be done with a small group.  Last I was doing it the group was:<br><br>41 Ranger (me)<br>40 Pally<br>40 Cleric (he was there bout 50% of the time)<br>44 Druid<br>40 Wiz<br><br>Every room took less then a minute to clear, no deaths, and our Cleric spent half the time rez'n people in the zone who met trains.<br><br>Since the rooms are easy you dont really need a Warrior as tank, or a chanter for control, and any class with a pet is trouble in there.  Magi's who insist on their pet just shouldnt go, same with Necros.<br><br>good camping<br>&nbsp;<br>-Zig<br><br>'Dont look at me, I'm too lazy to get off my arse and pull that!'</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The Surgical Strike<br><br>1) Start at 8am gametime so there are no undead in the way. Get all buffs loaded and all casters med to full.<br>2) Invis all the way in to the kitchen, know the way and do not hesitate since invis is unreliable in duration<br>3) Have the main tank targeted by the healers and begin casting heal at the same time the tank breaks invis by attacking a cook.  The cooks are SK mobs so 2 HT's will be coming inside 5 seconds to the tank.<br>4) All assist the tank on the cooks then the 3rd mob.  Mezzing is a luxury which makes this go a little smoother.<br><br>The kitchen is on a 18 min timer, with the cooks skipping spawns, ie 3 mobs, then 18 mins later one mob[no cooks],then 18 mins later 3 mobs[two cooks].<br><br>At this point you then need to decide is this a surgical strike or are you here for exp and or other reasons.  Pots only, just stay in the room and away from the walls, med along the hearth.<br><br>If you seek more, then you can pull the hall next, then the Butler Room and following that the Maid Room.  Taking each batch of 2-3 mobs in turn you should find yourself then ready for the next Kitchen pop.<br><br>Important points.  <br><br>Absolutely no runners.  Runner = death.  In seconds.  The sheer number of casting mobs waiting in the nearby rooms is staggering.<br><br>Run up to the mob you want, don't pull from a distance, and then lead them slowly back to the kitchen.  Anytime a mob is out of sight the pathing in this place is insane and you can very well find the Ambassador Room and Ballrom together paying you an unwelcome visit.<br><br>Pets are a very bad idea here as well for the same reason, aggro is seemingly random in the 10 times or so I've been there.  <br><br>Have an evac-capable member in the party.  Be cautious and perhaps have an itchy evac finger =)  Much easier to re-break that room then to get 6 bodies out of it.<br><br>IMHO the surgical strike is the way to success here, especially in the 30's.  Overreaching your offensive ability is easy and CR here is a bear as soon as the sun goes down.  Undead mobs mix with live mobs effectively removing the ability to get in and out.<br><br>So far the most effective group was last night's.<br><br>Lvl 40 SK [me]<br>Lvl 34 SK<br>Lvl 39 Cleric<br>Lvl 40 Wiz<br>Lvl 36 Shaman<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Kaedian Ravenblade<br>Tier'Dal Shadow Knight<br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>Forever soulbound to Celest Ravenblade</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have to agree with this post and will elaborate on it some.  <br><br>First, DON'T try to pull the cooks to the butler room with a mid 30'ish group.  As has been stated above, the cooks are shadowknights and the puller will be hit with two simultaneous harm touches.  In other words, the puller is not likely to survive the pull.<br><br>Here's how we clear the maid/butler room.  First off, it can be done with a small group of mid 30's if you work well together.  Generaly, we buff up at the zone line, and then go invis to the butler room.  Inside the butler room are two spawns.  The left spawn is always a gargoyle.  The right spawn is either Butler Syncall or a PH.  There is a thirds spawn just outside, in the hall.<br><br>Go in invisible and decide which target is first.  Generaly, as a bard, I charm the other target.  If you don't have a bard or an enchanter to charm/mezz the extra mob, you will most likely need a full group.  As long as the group stays in the room and stands clear of the door, the mob outside will usualy stay out.  Make sure someone is doing runner control and do not let anything leave the room.  In mistmoore, runners mean death.  Our rule has always been if anything gets past the door, we evac, no questions, no thinking, no wait, it's almost dead.  Corpse recovery here is not fun, we'd rather rebreak spawn than risk it.<br><br>Once the 2 spawns in the butler room are down, pull the spawn in the hallway and dispatch it.  The spawns are on an approximately 25 minute spawn, so now you have time to med up and heal up.  Again, a bard is very usefull here.<br><br>Next, take the maid room.  Here you have a choice.  You can charge the maid room, but we've found it easier to pull the maid room to the butler room.  First, clear the hall spawns.  There are 2 spawns outside the maid room, and unless you can harmonize them (MM is considered an outdoor zone), you'll have to pull them both.  Occasionaly, but not generaly, this will pull the spawns inside the maid room as well.  If so, you'll have a good fight on your hands.  Charm or mezz the extras and take casting mobs first.<br><br>Once you've cleared the hall spawns, you're ready to pull the maid room itself.  Here you'll have another garg and Maid Issis or her PH.<br><br>Once you've done this, I've found it easier to spread the spawn in the following way.<br><br>Wait for Butler room to respawn, and kill it.  Then, before the spawn outside the butler room pops, move to the maid room.  Pull the maid's hall spawns into the maid room and kill them there.  NOW pull the Butler hall spawn to maid room and kill it.  Finaly, go back to the Butler room, and pull maid room spawn.  From here out, you can stay in Butler room and maintain the same pull order, with much less danger of having things spawn on top of you.<br><br>If you do want to take the kitchen spawns as well, you either need someone with a WHOLE lotta hit points to pull, or you need to move to the kitchen invis, and have your healers start casting heals right before the tank attacks.  Hopefully, you'll catch him before the two harm touches kill him.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, by now most people know I have hunted MM exclusively from 24-35, save for when I went to get Morin's sword.<br><br>Here's the low-down:<br><br>lvl 24-26:<br><br>You will be hunting entry-level mobs.  This is anything u can find before wandering into the mountain pass.  Soloing is ok for the enemy tanks, but i wouldn't solo casters just yet (unless you have mad resists or some other way of preventing them from casting on you).  Just stay near the zone if you do.<br><br>In a group, you can pull from the mountain pass, all the way up to the graveyard gates.  once you get to the area where you can go inside the gates or down a cave, do neither.  Stop, turn around, and sit until the familiars (low-level mobs) repop.  You'll thank me later for this wisdom... Wish someone had told me :)<br><br>27-29:<br><br>soloing the familiars should be easy by now, even the casters.  If the zone is not crowded, that is the way to go.  I pulled a full bubble of exp from soloing in 45 minutes at lvl 27 once (and proceeded to lose it shortly thereafter; see the bottom of this thread).  If the zone is crowded, a group near the zone will work... or, if you are daring, join a group inside the graveyard (remember, those gates you turned away from 3 levels ago?).  Make sure it's a good group though.<br><br>30-32:<br><br>if you are sharp (and have a harmony spell of some kind) you can solo the tanks in the GY.  Great loot (FS or ringmail at least), good exp.  In a group, the familiars are probably green by now, so the GY should be your first choice...<br><br>if the GY is taken, and although the group there has 3 open spots they insist that their 4 friends are going to join them, you are going to have to look elsewhere.  There are 2 main favorites:<br><br>Entyi:<br><br>go into the cave, and head straight back (if you feel like it, you can cast invis first), pass under the bridge, and hit a wall.  turn around, and you should see 2 gargoyles and a named mob:  Entyi.  The hill in the back of this room is a good space to rest; only a lone walker has any hope of seeing you, and she's on a 30 minute cycle.  This spot is usually taken too, but the groups here are far more accepting than the GY hunters (mainly because there are no rare drops here)<br><br>Bug room:<br><br>go into the GY, taunt the group for about 5 minutes, then run behind the crypt (NOT INTO IT, otherwise if you are new to the area you will never find your way out) to SSynthi.  If you draw a line from the gravestones to her left, straight through her, and to the wall behind the tree, you just pointed to a secret wall.  Go ahead in.<br><br>You are now in the bug room, named so because the monsters that spawn behind the doors CANNOT move any farther than 1 foot outside of them.  In other words, If you are fighting all tanks, you can spit them to death (a walker comes through here, but 90% of the time it's camped anyway, as it's the PH'er for the Avenging Caitiff; see later).  If there are casters present, I recommend turning around.  To actually OPEN these doors, open the one exactly opposite of where you entered the bug room in the first place.  They all open up.  Other tricks can be used to abuse these mobs, but saying them would be wrong... I'll let you figure it out :)<br><br><br>Your other option:<br><br>Occasionally, a partial group will be sitting right at the bottom of the cave opposite of the gate to the GY.  If you dont mind keeping a heads up for trains 24/7, this can be a good spot too.<br><br><br>lvl 33-35:<br><br>if you have any attack that interrupts casting, the GY is THE place to solo.  the only casters here are of the cleric class, so if you can interrupt their healing, they are actually easier than the tanks.  But the tanks are still fun to play with.<br><br>The previous mentioned camping spots for lvls 30-32 still apply, but now...<br><br>if you are feeling VERY brave, now is when you get the chance to explore the castle.  from the bottom of the cave opposite the GY, turn left to see a small ramp going up the mountain.  Follow it to the top, and you will see the castle gates.  Like the nice guy Mayong Mistmoore is, he doesn't lock them.  If you are invisible, AND IT IS NOT NIGHT TIME, venture inside and have a look (a further reason is at the bottom).  Find a group familiar with the area, and you might actually be able to camp inside here.  It's fun, as long as you don't get careless (if the casters say "10%" do NOT assume you can pass the time by attacking the walking, weakling familiar... she's got friends, trust me).<br><br>I'm still at lvl 35, so this ends the strats for now...<br><br><br>Tired of seeing the references to the bottom of the post?  Well here it is:<br><br><br>WHY you don't want to walk around invisible at night:<br><br>a good deal of the upper-level casters in Mistmoore turn into undead creatures at night.  You may have lapped the castle 4 or 5 times now, but if the game timer reads 5:59, you HAUL @$$ to at least the GY gates or the Eentyi spawn.<br><br><br>LOOTS:<br><br>here's the good stuff:<br><br>Mistmoore shield:<br><br>a monster named "glyphed ghoul" can spawn anywhere a familiar does (including the walking one in the castle :(  ).  He spawns about every 4 hours, and has a one in 4 chance of carrying the shield (his normal drop is a vial of +40 magic resist).  I've gotten half a dozen of these, and they are nice, especially for a vl 24 character, if u happen to find one.<br><br>Sacrificial dagger:<br><br>in the GY, there are only 5 spawn points, on a 20 minute cycle.  any one of these points might spawn an Imp Familiar (roughly once in 6 hours... but i've seen 3 in 1 hour b4.  Go figure.)  He has a 3/4 chance of dropping a dagger that 9 out of 10 dagger-using casters would just love to have. (his other loot, the Bloodstone Eyepatch, is less popular).  This guy can be soloed by a ranger at lvl 31, so he's not too much tougher than your average GY mob.  FYI, he looks like a red gargoyle, but sounds like a constipated cow.<br><br><br>The Avenging Caitiff:<br><br>this is actually the haed man to speak to to get the Electrum-bladed Wakazashi quest, but most people would rather kill him for his dropped armor... Crested Spaulders usually (I've been on a Diablo2 vacation, so his other drop is eluding me).  If you actually want to do the quest, you are going to have to call the zone ahead of time and reserve your spot to talk to him before he gets blown 5 ways from Tuesday.  Both the dropped armor and the quest sword are worth picking up, even though it might be upwards of a month (out-of-guild) to do either.  There is no faction hit with HIM, but killing him I believe reduces Beta Neutral faction, which makes getting wizzie spells a pain in later levels. (I've never harmed him, it's an RP thing)<br><br><br>Maid/Butler fangs:<br><br>the 2 parts needed for the EBW quest above.  They are common drops for their mobs, but the mobs themselves are RARE.  I went for a 16 hour period once without seeing one... then I collapsed on my computer and woke up without my armor and back in Gfay :).  Normally, they are on about a 6-8 hour timer.  Their other loots are the Nightshade Wreath for the Maid, and the Butler has... Hmm, I don't think I've ever actually killed him yet and saw his drop.  O well.<br><br><br><br>Note on Trains:<br><br>Whoever thought up the Play nice Policies must not have been thinking about here.  Trains are a daily part of life. If you go an hour without seeing one called, either you are the only person in the zone, or there is a guild raid in progress involving 4 times as many people as is necessary to run the entire zone over.  If train is called, you either A) invis, B) get to a predetermined safe spot, or C) run like #ell.  there shall be no "but the mob only has 4 more hits to go!", unless you like the death music.  A train only needs 30 seconds to get from the farthest reaches of MM to the zone, and most trains start just a teeny bit closer.  If u currently are in combat, pray its in an out-of-the-way area.  And don't bother reporting anyone... This is just Train central.  You'll end up starting them too, just roll with it.  You'll gain a lot more from this zone than u lose.<br><br><br>Average loots are about 6gp or rusty stuff from familiars (max I've seen is 3pp), or 1pp and FS/ringmail from the GY and farther mobs (max seen 6pp).  If you have group security (or maybe life insurance), you can get rich off this zone.  I was able to fund a fletching skill of 160 off of these guys, with cash to spare.  (P.S. 1 attempt now costs about 6pp per 5-pack of arrows, so a full quiver of these things is about 150pp.  Given a good time, you might get that in a DAY.)<br><br><br>That's it for now, happy runn-  er, I mean hunting!<br><br><br><br><br>ADDENDUM (9-21-00)<br><br>ok, after 9-19's patch, new stuff has shown up.  I am now going to add it, as well as my recent experience on some in-castle fighting.<br><br>1) the new mobs.  In Eentyi's spot are now a pack of 5 blood wolves.  they are NOT KOS (repeat NOT) to anyone... iksars have already walked up and petted the nice puppies :)<br><br>They are rather useful as life savers as it turns out.  if u are being dumped upon by casters weilding mean AoE spells, run into this mix of mutts.  1 hit from an AoE and they will relieve your caster problem (as long as you dont mind losing the kill)<br><br>In this pack spawns a Black Huntress... she sounds harsh, but she is actually not the main point to this pack.  She is actually a PH'er for a named Giant Wolf, Black Dire.  He si Dubious to everyone at this point, and as yet I have not discovered his faction (being lvl 50+ im not gonna try and kill him to see what goes down :).  Again, he is NOT kos.  Dark elves have hailed him at close range, and all they get in return is "oh look, a talking pile of Refuse.  How novel".<br><br>In other words, feel free to camp eentyi as you have before, just avoid those AoE spells.  and if casters get on your back, use the wolves to your advantage.<br><br>2) after some extra maid/butler hunting (including one hard-to-retrieve death:(  ) I figured some more info than just their loots was in order.<br><br>TO GET TO THEM:<br><br>go into the main castle gate.  go around either direction (its a rectangle) and u will enter the Main Hall.  don't go up the steps; instead, go in the passage straight ahead from the castle gate (assuming the 1st wall hadnt been there), and turn left.  Go straight all the way to the end of the passage, and turn right.  Now, facing the next passage, STRAFE a few steps right until u are face-2-face with a solid wall.  walk into it, and u find it's not so solid :).  go through that hidden passage, and then turn left.  go all the way straight, then turn right.  ok, u are just about there.  take 10 or so steps forward, and u have a choice:<br><br>A) turn right through a fake wall and find the ancille cooks<br><br>B) take 5 more steps, turn right down a passage, go all the way, then enter the door on your left to find maid(ph)<br><br>C) go all the way to the end of the hall and enter door to find butlet(ph).<br><br>before doing any of the above, i want you to promise me that you will NOT go in at night time, unless u like running into undead... and further, before you camp ANYTHING, if this is your first time here, as soon as you get to the ancille cook area, backtrack your ENTIRE route so u know how to get back out.  Or back in if u die.<br><br><br>(9-27-00)<br>Ok, ever new info... I have now seen the Black Huntress all over MM.  This includes AT the wolves, in the castle, trained through the GY, and in the bug room.  I.E. she may NOT be the ph'er for Dire, but she's still a pain.  As far as her type, I caught a glimpse of her casting diamondskin, so a circa-40's druid is most likely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wildkat, Xegony<br>Jendar, Tholuxe Paells<br><br>I post, therefore...

	   <tr><td colspan=2>nice post mousemaster, If I had the time I would finish off the details to castle, tower, back halls and anythin ya missed.<br><br>Anyway here are most of the rares and their drops... I'm not quotin a page, this is from personal exp btw.<br><br>Gylphed Ghoul courtyard area<br>Vamp Blood: 75%-80% drop rate<br>CMM Sheild: roughly one outta every 5 ghouls has it.  Clearly Visible when the ghoul has it<br><br>Imp Familiar Right tombstone, rear GY<br>BS Eyepatch: roughly every 3/4 drops is this.<br>Sac Dagger: roughly a 25% drop.  the Imp will peirce instead of hit when carring this<br><br>Avengin Cait Jail wanderer<br>Crested Spaulders: 90% drop rate at LEAST.  Killed 11 caits straight getting only these.<br>Crested Helm: 1/10 on average.<br><br>Maid 2nd Servants quarters *RARE*<br>NSW: this is her common.  This is also very desired.  Due to her spawn rate this will drop every 7th spawn per room.<br>Fang: 1/10 maid spawn.  due to rarity of maid this can take as long as 100 room spawns.  room is a 30 minute timer.<br><br>Butler 1st servants quarters<br>cape: very common. almost always has this<br>Fang: roughly 1/20th per spawn. slightly easier then maid fang IMO<br><br>Ancille Cooks  Kitchen. OK these are not rare, just on a 60 minute timer.<br>Cauldron (for Pally quests).  this is a 1/10th drop.  Thats at a minimum.  Worked the Maid/Butler/Cooks one day with a few friends.  we got 1 pot outta 30 cooks. 2 wreaths 9 cape and the butler fang.  thats 15 hours of camping.<br><br>Dhampyre  courtyard by fountain<br>Blood:  I have always seen this drop. my guess is a 90% rate orhigher<br>Cloak: I have never gotten this to drop, but I know they do come from there. 10% or maybe even a 5% drop on this item.  Also the Dhampyre's spawn is as rare as the Maid. roughly every 7 or so spawns hes up.<br><br>Mynthi Davissi  ballroom??<br>Loot and Drums are her drops. never camped her no real idea where she spawns or what the rate of drop is<br><br>Princess Cherista  throne<br>No longer is itemized.  Her scepter's new form drops in Kedge though.<br><br>Lasna   jacuzzi area<br>Diamonide Earrings: 65% drop rate from my experience.<br>Plat Skull Ring: 35% drop.  Would rather the earring instead of this.<br><br>Xicotl  small room near Lasna<br>Soulfire Hilt: this and only this is his drop.<br><br>Garton Viswen  Tower, on the symbol of the 7<br>GIP: easy to know when he has this.  He weilds it in combat.  carries this roughly 70% of the time.<br>BP: When hes without a pike in hand hes got this.  Great item for those who can use if they dont already have better.<br><br><br>Thats all on the rares.  for those wondering the longest camp is for the EBW fangs.  these can run a player 100+ hours of camp.  whats worse now is Rangers need these for their CoF quest.<br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>-Zig<br><br>'Dont look at me, I'm too lazy to get off my arse and pull that!'</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>My own personal experience has been different in a few areas.<br><br>First of all, I've killed the imp familiar about 10 times and have never seen the eyepatch.  It's had the dagger every single time.<br><br>Second, I've seen a lot more fangs drop.  Although rare, my guild managed 3 sets of fangs in 3 raids.  Each raid lasted about 6-8 hours.  In other camps w/out guild, I've seen approximately 1 fang per 3 1/2 hours.  We've done a bit better than 1 maid/butler per 7 spawns as well, I'd say the rate has been 1 per 4 for each.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Personally I've never seen my standing with Beta Neutral lower any myself. <br>The "Bug Room" isn't a bug, its a jail. That's why the mobs don't leave their area, its possibly the easiest/safest room to camp in MM. You can solo those mobs one at a time with out fear of training, and the jail also houses an ingot needed for cleric (I think thats the class) armor.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
