<hr size=1>
<p><font size=+1>Is this a message board?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes and no.&nbsp; It is anticipated that questions
and back and forth discussions will continue to be posted in the General
Everquest Forum rather than here.&nbsp; This forum is for more substantial
posts containing information you feel will help other players with the
game.&nbsp; As such, messages will not scroll off in the manner of a standard
message board.&nbsp; That does not mean that you can't comment on another
post to correct misinformation or add additional information.&nbsp; The
rating system should help eliminate the less useful posts.
<p><font size=+1>How do the forum filters work?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can adjust the forum settings to your personal
preferences.&nbsp; Simply make the changes and hit the change button.&nbsp;
If you also check save, the settings you choose will be your default settings
each time you visit the forums.&nbsp; The filters at the top of the forum
do the following from left to right:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)&nbsp; Flat vrs Threaded.&nbsp; Choosing flat will
bring up the full text of each primary message on the forum.&nbsp; Choosing
threaded will only bring up the subject lines.&nbsp; The default is threaded.&nbsp;
Be warned that choosing flat will significantly increase the loading time
for each page.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)&nbsp; Auto Expand.&nbsp; You may choose to automatically
expand messages higher than a certain rating so that the full text of those
messages appear while the rest of the messages only show the subject line.&nbsp;
The default is to never auto expand.&nbsp; Be warned that the more messages
you auto expand, the longer the loading time will be for each page.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)&nbsp; Order.&nbsp; You can change the order of
the messages to show you the newest messages first, oldest messages first
or highest rated messages first.&nbsp; The default is to show the newest
messages first.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)&nbsp; Filter @.&nbsp; This filter lets you eliminate
from view any messages rated below the threshold you set.&nbsp; Thus setting
it at no 2 (below average) will cause those messages rated 1 (awful) to
not appear on any forum you visit and setting it at 5 (excellent) will
only show you those messages rated excellent.&nbsp; The default is 2.
<p><font size=+1>Should I rate a comment that is already rated at the proper
level?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; The ratings system relies upon
many people adding their rating.&nbsp; Even if the post is rated about
where you think it belongs, be sure to still add your rating.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Because if someone else comes along and rates it at a significantly different
level, it will change the number.&nbsp; The more ratings a post gets, the
more likely it is that it will rise or fall to, or stay put at, its proper
level.
<p><font size=+1>How do I determine where to rate a comment?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is up to you to decide how useful and informative
a post is.&nbsp; In general, these are the ratings:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rating 1.&nbsp; Awful.&nbsp; Flames and generally
worthless comments.&nbsp; A useless post.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rating 2.&nbsp; Below Average.&nbsp; Contains some
general insight.&nbsp; A few people may find it useful.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rating 3.&nbsp; Average.&nbsp; Contains some interesting
information.&nbsp; Some people would find it useful.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rating 4.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Well written and informative.&nbsp;
Many people would find this information useful
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rating 5.&nbsp; Excellent.&nbsp; A post you think
almost everyone should read.
<p><font size=+1>Why are some comments not rated?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make sure it gets listed correctly, it takes at
least 3 separate ratings on a coment before it gets assigned a rating.
<p><font size=+1>Why should I register?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registered posters get their posts rated at a 3 right
from the start.&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, anonymous posts are initially
rated at a level 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; After 15 posts, registered users are assigned
a karma rating based upon the average ratings of their posts.&nbsp; (see
below for how that works).&nbsp;&nbsp; From then on, each post you make
is automatically rated at your karma level. Plus, your name gets highlighted
if you achieve and maintain a high enough karma. Because most users will
want to read the higher rated posts first, building up a good karma rating
will ensure that your posts are read more often.&nbsp; Registration also
applies to the rated forums on every rated forum on allakhazam.com, carrying
over your karma to new games as they are added.
<p><font size=+1>I'm already registered for the forum and the auction.&nbsp;
Do I need to register again?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately yes.&nbsp; This system is separate
from the ubb forums and the auction.
<p><font size=+1>What is my Karma Rating?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Karma rating is the average score your posts
have been rated at by site visitors.&nbsp; The rating comes from posts
made under your registered name on any of the rated forums for any game
covered by allakhazam.com.&nbsp; You must have at least 15 posts before
you receive a karma rating.&nbsp; Then any future post you make will start
out at your karma level.&nbsp; Titles are assigned to your posts according
to the following scale:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karma below 3 = user.&nbsp; Posts are in dark blue.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karma between 3.01 and 3.65&nbsp; = scholar.&nbsp;
Posts are in yellow.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karma between 3.66 and 4.34 = sage.&nbsp; Posts
are in green.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karma between 4.35 and 5 = guru.&nbsp; Posts are
in red
<p><font size=+1>What type of information should I post?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post anything you feel may be useful to the other
players.&nbsp; There is no limit on the topic and length of your post,
except that it should fit the category in which it is posted.&nbsp; In
general, the more inciteful and detailed your post, the more likely it
is to get a high rating.&nbsp; Also feel free to post follow-up comments
on other posts.
<p><font size=+1>How do I add things like bold and italics to my post?</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to use the standard ubb codes for this.&nbsp;
These are similar to html codes.&nbsp; Below are the most common:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [b]Bold[/b]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [i]Italic[/i]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [u]Underline[/i]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [quote]will use the blockquote
tag[/quote]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [link]link.link.com[/link]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [link=http://urlgoeshere]Label
