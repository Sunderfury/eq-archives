By order of the Council of Qeynos I have been given the duty of apprehending the individuals [responsible] for unleashing this terrible plague upon the people and the lands of Antonius Bayle. The more I look into this matter, the more I come to find that this will be no easy task. <br><br>You say, 'How can I advance further?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Interested in advancing further are you? Excellent, we are ready to begin the next phase of our operation. We have gathered a great deal of information as a result of the latest series of arrests. What we require most now are [interrogators] that are able to pry the information we require out those less then willing to talk. <br><br>You say, 'What interrogators?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'If you are interested in joining the ranks of our interrogators and helping Qeynos further as we bring these fiends and murderers to justice, turn in your investigator's Badge and I will give you the briefing document you need. I already know I can trust my investigator's, so there is no need to further test you. <br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Very well, here is the briefing document. Please read it very carefully. I wish you luck friend, this mission could prove to be dangerous. <br><br>The document leads you to an interrogator.<br><br>You say, 'Hail, an interrogator'<br><br>an interrogator says 'I see you wish to become an interrogator. This is not a duty for the weak of heart you know. This job sometimes requires. .. an interrogator coughs, 'a little muscle I guess you would say.' <br><br>an interrogator says 'Nevertheless, we have an important job to do. There is a man by the name of Theodore Exanthem who is a known member of the Bloodsaber cult. He fled from Qeynos some time ago and we have been hot on his tail ever since. <br><br>an interrogator says 'We have tracked this man down and we now know his whereabouts. However, we have bigger fish to fry today then just this low life. Theodore knows the location of two other individuals also suspected of hiding out here in the plains. <br><br>an interrogator says 'Sadly, these fiends were the two that slipped into Surefall Glade and poisoned the waters there. Though the druids were able to quickly combine their efforts and neutralize the toxins with their magicks, grievous damage was done none the less. Two of the great protectors of the hills and the glade, Holly Windstalker and Cros Treewind, became seriously ill as did one of the glade's sacred bears. <br><br>an interrogator says 'Holly and Cros, sickened as they were, removed themselves from the Hills to weather out their illness and to keep the disease from spreading further. During their absence, the Bloodsabers were easily able to traffic in the materials needed to complete their terrible work. <br><br>an interrogator shakes his head sadly and says, 'Tragically, Cros Treewind was attacked by one of the sacred bears which was maddened by its illness. In his weakened state Cros was unable to defend himself and was killed by this defiled grizzly, one of the very creatures he was sworn to protect.' <br><br>an interrogator says 'So our goal is to pry the information we need from Theodore Exanthem so that we may bring these two fugitives to justice. After getting him to comply, you are to collect a confession from Theodore and have him lead us to the two fugitives. Give me Theodore's confession and the heads of these two fugitives and you shall have your badge. <br><br>an interrogator says 'I believe I know where we can find him. Follow me please. <br><br>Follow the interrogator.<br><br>an interrogator says 'Theodore Exanthem by order of the Council of Qeynos and his lordship Antonius Bayle, I order you to come out of there immediately! <br><br>an interrogator says 'Theodore Exanthem, you will [take us to the location] of Marcus Cachexia and Morley Murrain immediately. <br><br>Theodore Exanthem says 'I think you've been breathing the air in the Northern Plains of Karana for too long. I will most certainly not tell you anything about their whereabouts, much less lead you right to them. You are not right in the head. <br><br>an interrogator says 'Vile beast! You are withholding information on two men guilty of terrible atrocities, not the least of which was causing the death of one of Qeynos' most respected and well known citizens, Cros Treewind! As an Interrogator I am authorized to use physical force if necessary. <br><br>Theodore Exanthem says 'What a joke! I'm not telling you a thing. You don't look like you could scare a moss snake. I'm not afraid of you! <br><br>You say, 'Take us to the location'<br><br>Theodore Exanthem reels back, his eyes wide with shock. Ow, he says nervously. <br><br>an interrogator says '[Take us to the location] of Markus Cachexia and Morley Murrain! <br><br>You say, 'Take us to the location'<br><br>Theodore Exanthem winces and says, Oh. Yeah right. Like I'm afraid of that moron or something. Theodore glances nervously over at you. <br><br>an interrogator says 'Take us to Markus Chachexia and Morley Murrain this instant or I'll turn you over to my friend here who appears to be much stronger then I am! <br><br>an interrogator smiles and says, 'Well, I'm getting tired. Why don't you hit him for a while. Maybe you will be more convincing then I have been.' <br><br>Attack him without a weapon.<br><br>Theodore Exanthem says 'Sweet father of rot, alright already! Stop hitting me and tell me what you want me to do! <br><br>Give him the unsigned confession document you got from the inspector.<br><br>You say, 'Take us to the location'<br><br>Theodore Exanthem says 'Fine follow me creeps. <br><br>At this point you follow the interrogator to the south to the abandoned druid ring. The culprits spawn along with some minnions and wraiths.  They are Morley Murrain and Markus Chachexia.  Bring back their heads along with the signed confession.<br><br>an interrogator says 'Excellent work, you did just fine today. You'll make a fine interrogator. Talk to Vegalys about advancing further. <br><br>You receive your interrogators badge</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A couple things to note from when I did this quest.  Min level of 30 doesn't mean solo, if a level 27 mob gives you exp bring a few friends, whatever you need to take 2 SKs and their pets (a tank for each SK, or an enchanter or bard to mez one, or whatever.)  The first time we went up against the 2 SKs was a 34 druid and 35 ranger and it didn't go well.  You turn in your old badge to do the quest so remember you have no neck item while doing this quest, not overly important but can make a difference.  Morley Murrain and Markus Chachexia are both shadowknights so having magic resist along with disease and poison resist will definitly help.  The interrigator is a serious blowhard, that guy rambles on forever, but I used all that time to buff and med (you can still listen and talk to him while medding.)<br><br>Read the book, it actually tells you to go get a confession document from an INVESTIGATOR, I never tried to ask the interrigator for one but I suggest getting one off the investigator from quest number one before running off to south karana.<br><br>When the part came up to attack Theodore Exanthem I jumped the gun early, make sure everything has progressed to this point BEFORE you attack him.  Also Turn off damage shields I think me having a DS the first time screwed up teddy.  Anyhow you can attack him, don't think it matters if you use a weapon, 1hp damage made him die and a new version spawned in his place (this is what turns off your autoattack, it also removes him from your target because it's a different guy) which seems to fix whatever everyone else was doing to screw up.  The most important point I have is don't attack Theodore Exanthem till you know for sure the interrigator is ready and make sure you have no damage shields on.  Also the quest can continue without getting a confession document out of him but make sure you get one because without it you get no badge.<br><br>Next up is the 2 SKs at the rings, the interrigator and teddy both stop up the hill and out of aggro range (he is NOT your pet like in the first quest) and you have all the time you want to jump these guys but I suggest get there before the interrigator and jump the SKs before they buff up.  I did not see "20+ green mobs" or "2 level 27 SK's, 2-3 wraiths (mini spectres), and 2-3 minions (skellies)" that the quest and some earlier posters implied, I simply saw the two (level 27) shadowknight NPCs and their pets, one pet was a mini spectre called a ghoul and the other was a skeleton called minion.  What finally worked for us was to snare one SK and drag the unsnared one and the 2 green pets out past "forget" range of the snared one to kill, the SK will be somewhat challenging if not green but we just let the pets kill themselves on the ranger damage shield until the first SK was dead.  We then finished off what was left of the pets and came back to the snared SK to dispatch him. <br><br>Turn in the heads from the 2 SKs and the signed confession from teddy boy and you get your second badge! If you fail it's possible to come back and finish off the SKs later, we did our CR and came back but one SK was missing, my guess is the one we almost killed ended up going NPC vs NPC with low life and lost as we watched the other SK aggro aviaks (one of them can solo an aviak avocet with no problems) and other NPCs while we rebuffed.  Also re-did the quest the second time and never got a confession from teddy or killed the second shadowknight (already had a confession doc and that one's head from the first attempt) so you CAN skip parts and the quest will still continue.<br><br>GOOD LUCK ALL!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Ran back to the interrogator and handed in the 2 heads and the signed confession and got my badge while the minions were tickling me.  for the heck of it, i ran off a little ways, memmed Upheaval and waited for them to join me.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>this is a good quest, and depending on your level, it seems to be fairly easy, but then i am a lvl 55 druid.  The biggest part of this portion of the quest is whether you are kos to the corrupt guard faction.  If you are you might try going wolf/bear form as qeynos is the only city i know where i can run around in as a wolf and I did so since form of the howler does give a mana regen.  My buddy, Blayda Winterhawk, ran around in bear form watching me perform this first step of the quest, that and he knew Qeynos much better than I, and helped me get to the locations necessary to obtain confessions.<br><br>I must say that reading the player comments helped immensely.  I have but one suggestion.<br><br>It is suggested to just go ahead and kill Donally Stultz and obtain his head without asking the investigator for an unsigned confession.  This is somewhat in error as the second stage of this quest (interrogator's badge) requires the use of one unsigned confession.  My suggestion is to ask the investigator for the unsigned confession, Do NOT give Donally the unsigned confession rather just put it in your inventory for the next stage of the quest.  Now you can attack Donally, kill him, and loot his head.<br><br>I guess I do have one other suggestion and that concerns the investigator.  As was posted earlier, he has a tendency to keep moving around and has lousy pathing.  Use the pet command /pet guard here to stop him from moving around when talking with each suspect.  When getting ready to kill Donally Stultz, make sure you park the investigator outside of your aggro range and Donally's aggro range unless you need him to fight your battle.  Unfortunately, Donally can and will kill the investigator.  When the investigator dies, he despawns and it seems to take a while for him to repop (maybe an hour).  If you have to wait to turn in the 2 signed confessions and the head, it is all well and good but remember that when you do turn in the items the investigator despawns again and there might be someone else wanting to do this quest..Happened to my son and i am afraid another player had to wait for the investigator to pop again.<br><br>Dekkon Fuzzyfeet<br>lvl 55 Preserver<br>The Final Covenant<br>Innoruuk Server<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hail, fellow Investigators!  I've been banging my head against this bug-ridden quest for about four days now, and thought I'd share my discoveries with you.  Now, to kick this quest off, you will need to turn in your old badge.  If you screw ANYthing up later, you will NOT be recieving your old badge back.  Please bear that in mind.<br><br>After turning in my badge for the Interrogator's Manual, it was off to SK.  He was nowhere to be found until I camped - as soon as I reentered Norrath, my Tracking guildie saw him pop.  Before giving him the Manual, be sure to /shout your intentions.  If anyone decides to loot one of the heads, or kill the suspect that pops in the hermit house, you are SCREWED.  Back to step 1 for you.<br><br>After Teddy is called out by the Interrogator, and you slap him around, he'll lead you to the abandoned druid ring next to the hermit's shack.  You may not see the Summoned Minions and Wraiths, but there ARE there.  I brought a friend for this step - he kited the undead around while I smacked Morley and Markus down.  They're in their 30s.<br><br>The first time I did this, someone took it upon themselves to loot one of the NoDrop heads, then refused to come forth and MultiQuest the damned thing with me.  Sigh.  After redoing the first part, turning in my badge for the Manual, and heading back, I was unable to find the Interrogator at his usual spawn point.  Instead, he was exactly where I'd left him, on the hill looking down on the druid ring ruin.  This was after logging a couple times, AND redoing the 1st part.<br><br>Good luck on this quest... you'll need it!<br><br><br>Markoff Chaney<br>Gnecro of the 41st Corpse<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>For those of you reading down here for hints about THIS part of the quest instead of the third part the only real hints:<br><br>The interrogator spawns in SK due east of the Hermit's cottage by a tree next to the zone "cliff".<br><br>Go ahead and give Theodore the confession document when you get to the top of the hill over-looking the druid ring.<br><br>The two guys are nastier than people let on.  They were green to me at 37, but the necro nukes for 150 and will happily snare you and fear kite you... as well the SK has a nasty harm touch and ahs no qualms about doing the same thing.  In addition BOTH of these guys can and will summon over 20 pets each! As a bard I died in my first attempt thinking I could just melee these two greenies.  Luckily everyone was still up by the time I got back and was able to get my corpse away from them....  they give you plenty of time to kill these two guys.  I ended up kiting the necro and his horde of undead around until he ran out of mana (the old kite until have dead then lose them for a time trick) and then just chant kited him.... the SK was easier... just a straight chant kite.  The 40+ skeletons and wraiths that were left over I just left to wander about the zone.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I did the third part today myself. I messed up first time and gave jar to one of the rats, doh! I'm a gnome and didn't see the "tiles", they are like shadowmen, only see thier name.  I redid whole thing from the start, took about 4 hours.  But I took some shortcuts like killed shilster and the gnome in wk on same trip to quenos to start it. And remembered to ask for confession document from investigator BEFORE I handed in the signed ones, so don't have to wait for repop.<br><br>Anyways, the pattern of the rats is definatly different both times i did it! You only have 6 "standard norrathian hours" to solve the puzzle. Thats about 20 minutes. <br><br>Its kind of confusing to look at the pattern from the ground, you are much better off diagramming whatever pattern they appear in on paper and solveing it before actually trying. The instructions hint at writing it out first too, say to use X for diseased and O for clean.  <br><br>If you've ever played the game Othello or Reversi, its the same concept. You souround you oppenent and capture the ones in a straight line.  Except in this game it doesn't work diagnol, and you can only put your pieces in certain spots.<br><br>This quest really did require some thought, really impressed.  Kudos to quest team! Do more like this.<br><br>Oh, when I messed up the first time, I put the jars in spots I KNEW were wrong and still got empty jars back. Apparently when you turn in the three empty jars, it will then check that all the rats are cured before gives you the Badge. I assumed if some diseased ones still up will say test was a failure, but seriously doubt if will give Interrogators badge back, so save some heartache and work it out on paper and be sure.<br><br>Result is a rather nice item:<br><br>Researcher's Badge<br>AC 4 Wis 3 int 3 Agi 3 Str 3 Mana 15 HP 15<br>NECK LORE MAGIC NO DROP  ALL/ALL<br><br>I replaced my goblin soulcaller as standard wear, which is 5 wis 10 magic. And actually 3 wis/15 mana is about the same for my level, maybe little less, but str is worth it since I carry a couple bags of resist gear around. Very pleased with item here!  :)<br><br>He doesn't allude to there ever being a forth part like the other quests ended in. Wasn't any "try back at later date".  But I got a feeling the next Qeynos newspaper will say something like "all researchers should report to NewNPC_00 for additional testing" or something along those lines. Rumours on main board were that this item will eventually have clickable effects, so get yours now!<br><br>As for the gnome in wk, if having trouble tracking her, try using sense summoned or sense undead, can lock onto her pet. Only two summoned things in most of WK. And if along north wall will get the gnome.  Also hang around choon and broon or whoever, she will fight them. I attacked while choon was already on her pet, so kept him out of fight.  Of course he jumped us when pet finally died.  She also will depop when gets between Ogre camp and NK zone, saw it with my own eyes, got loc in log file. She pops again in 2-3 minutes at far west side of zone, around corrupt guard tower, and walks east along north wall. Same path as Ghoul Messenger (killed him on way too). Will know when she up, because she talks trash in zone. <br><br>I am convinced a 49 cleric cannot solo her, can get really really close, but I had to zone three times before getting some friends (Thanks ZShaaka and Gallana! Also thanks to Utamr, Airanwen and Thiengy of The Kindred Soul for helping the first time around). Was no contest with group, complety crushed her.  She is level 40. Only spell I noticed cast was fear which was resisted everytime. No dots or engulf, however we were still fully buffed for necro battle.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>He, sorry I laughaed at ya, Reatsel, She does indeed seem to be a timed spawn. Went back there, and saw a Bard, who had not a clue about the Quest(but apparently just kills everything blue in sight)trying to kill her. Bard was red to my 46, but she *hardly* dented her with melee, she missed a lot, and hit for 17-22 points damage. Also the necro had nasty damageshield up, the bard said. Anyway, the bard lost her out of sight(they had feared eachother a bit too much)but still had her on tracking. After a while she despawned. I was looking around at the supposed triggerspot again, and about a minute later I heard Biddilets shout again. Now I wanted to be sure: I tracked her, and followed her from the Qeynos end of the zone to the NK end of the zone, taking about 10-15 minutes walk Real time. There she despawned, and I pushed my chrono. 90 seconds later I heard her shout again......<br><br>So, she seems to be on a timer all right, about 15 minutes real time. ANd during the walk through WK she refreshed "Shrieking AUra" (damageshield) twice, so she is a *bad* mob to melee, also because she hits so darn hard, and has major hitpoints.(well, about those of a Hill giant, maybe a bit more, which is rather much for a caster)<br><br>AGain, sorry about my presumptous manner, Raetsel.<br><br>Grove, Innoruuk. <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Haha, Raetsel, well, you can wait for her for 60 minutes, as Reatsel is suggesting, or you could go to the location I described below (loc +802 -4289) and trigger her spawn. The best way to do this, is with the old Pet trick many of us used in the 4th shawl quest. Go to that location(it is near the second batch of Merchanthouses from the Qeynos Hills entrance, summon a pet, or charm a bear, then tell the pet to "/pet guard here"  The pet will immediately face the nearest mob/trap/SPAWNTRIGGER. Then walk in a straight line from your pet to where he is facing and you'll hear Biddilets shout; "what a nicely diseased place this is, tralala, tralalie". <br><br>Credits go to Yubby, whom I helped with his quest, after I had done my own. He suggested the trick when we could not immediately find her triggerspawn, and about 30 seconds later we had her triggered through the old trick. In the 2 hours before, she spawned twice, both when I was at that same location. FIrst time pure luck, I was scanning the zone strategically(she NEVER was on track before I heard her do the SHout, at any given time), second time I went back there because I had a hunch I triggered her. And yes, there she was again(the SHout). Third time was with Yubby, and that one really convinced me. There was no mob around, the pet faced something unseen immediately, and we triggered her 3 seconds later, when we walked the line from the pets nose. SHe spawns not near btw, she spawns near the barb village, about half way there from where you triggered her. When you are near the guard tower that you can see from that first batch of merchant houses (nr 2 I think) you can prolly see her on track already.<br><br>What we didnt try was to get her spawntrigger targeted, in all the exitement we went right for her. So I would suggest people try the trick at that location, then do the old summon food, and try to "give" it to the spawntrigger trick. <br><br>SO she spawned thrice in less then three hours. Anyway, you can wait forever, or you can try to spawn her. Somehow the second seems more fun. ;)<br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To respond to your query above, "If anyone can confirm whether or not the rats can be attacked by passers-by, it would be appreciated."<br><br>While doing the rat test a newbie came by and started attacking the rats.  While they can be attacked, it looked like no damage was being done.  Maybe cause the rats despawn and respawn when attacked.  Not sure what a massive DD will do though.<br><br>After I sent a tell to the newbie not to attack the rats, they started attacking the tiles.  (weird players out there)<br><br>I still completed the quest and got the badge despite a newbie's attack.<br><br>My puzzle looked like this:<br>   o<br> xxx<br>  xx<br> ox <br><br>I noticed too, when you turn in the book, another Velarte spawns and the original despawns.  So I'm not sure you can turn in the empty jars to the original or not (why would you anyways?)<br><br>--Nidwyn Questmaster--<br>Bertoxx server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
