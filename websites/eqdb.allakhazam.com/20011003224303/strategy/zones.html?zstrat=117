	   <tr><td colspan=2>There is a quest in Stonebrunt for the Crystalized shadow armor and weapons, and fading shadow armor. You can look up the details but the rewards are: Turning an Crystalized shadow weapon, into a purified crystal weapon with exact same DMG/DLY but +4cha +5sv all. The dagger fits in range and is caster useable too so you could get a 4cha 5sv all range item. The Fading Shadow weapons turn into Purified weapons with exact same DMG/DLY but +2cha +3sv all, same with the dagger and range slot. On the armor it veries with the stat changes but it makes it so they are all druid useable. I looted the gloves belt and helm, they were plate only useable, then I did the quest and my HFL DRU could use them. Cool look, sucky stats, low wt on most of them so they would be ok for an untwinked lowbie monk.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fear the power of my Fishing Pole Of Death!<br>Prexus Server<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>On all levels there is a possiblity of crystallized shadow (for Stoneburnt mountain quests and fair monk armor), gnome skin (fair PR gear and monk armor), fading shadow and velium weapons (sell to merchant).<br>I have not done 6th and 7th floor often enough to give you a loot list for that floor, but I do know Tserrina drops a mage only no drop snowball, ghostly robes, and some type of whip.  Torchs drop a very nice no rent 1hb too (good to play with or give to pets if you are up there killing a lot).<br>I heard that the 7th floor is also good EXP for a 50+ group too and the one time I was up there is was pretty tough, kept getting lots of nasty adds.<br><br>On the first floor the key drops off a large undead gnoll who can be tiggered from basically any MOB on that floor.  The loot isn't too great on this floor, but shadowbones can drop some fairly nice "newbie" weapons and a shadowbone earring (2int 4agi).  It's fairly easy to clear, just levitate the puller and have him pull a few at a time and AoE them if you are a high enough level.<br><br>On the second floor the key drops off a angered or enraged librarian which is also a random tiggered MOB from any MOB on that floor.  She is the only one who will drop really decent loot, and she drops 2 nice caster range slot items:<br>Student's Homework which adds 3 int and mana (forget what else) and Teacher's Syballus which adds 3 int, mana, 3 wis, and 20 poison resist.<br>This floor can also be cleared with AoEs because the MOBs don't have much HP, just becareful of getting DOTed.  If you are taking a fairly low level group (30s-35) you can gain a good amount of EXP on this floor at low risk.  Look for a secret bookcase along on of the corners which leads to a zone out.<br><br>The third floor I have not camped much, but I do know that an enraged cook (which seems to be tiggered by any shadow beast cook) drops the key and a very nice crafted velium ring (2ac 3agi 3sta 15hp 8svfire).  I believe there is another named here, but not sure of the name or what she drops.<br><br>The 4th floor is a very nice, but significantly harder floor.  There are a few traps which will lead to a room with a flame in it, clicking the flame will take you back to the floor entrance, be careful there are MOBs near by.  One of the most difficult things about this floor is the intial break in, loads of MOBs will wander in once you head to the floor entrance, so be prepared for a hard battle.  One of the keys will open the locked door (was either first or 3rd floor key) to the right of the entrance.  Around there a named mummy will spawn named Amhotep, if you are looking for the key kill it and wait for Cara the key holder to spawn in another room a fair ways off.  Another name I remember is Narmak something another named MOB.  Drops include a nice helmet (for plate classes I believe) summon bandage dagger, magnetic dirk of distraction, and frost covered tome.<br><br>The 5th floor is the wedding, and this room is pretty strange foward.  Crash the wedding (I forget what actually drops what) and a few goodies will drop including Spiked Velium Helm and an extremely nice Wedding Ring: Some ac (2?), 5int 5wis 15mana 8svfire 8svcold 3dex and a Ceremonial Wedding Sword (quest or maybe just for show as it has no stats).  The enraged relative drops the key.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>ok me and a few friends spend lots of time here actually its me and one friend always dragging others there lol but by this point we know alot about it hope this helps a little<br><br>In general- take an enchanter cause trust me youll need one on every floor but the 1st it is so easy to get pulls you dont want the enchanter will save your life =) as always in dungeons have an evacer but ehre its even better cause sometimes the mirrors for teh exits arent so east to find =) and even worse sometimes there locked!!<br> <br>FLOOR 1-<br>  simple every time ive seen the key dropped on this floor(off a large undead gnoll) its triggered by the shadowbone in the last or second to last hallway on the left. Ive been told anything on teh floor can trigger it though but its easy enough to clear the whole floor so if all else fails kill everything =) once you have the key youll find the mirror in the right corridor after you run through the doorway guarded by teh lesser iceshades<br>  cool drops- Gnome skin!!! lol this armor sucks but looks really cool its simply black armor pretty much no texture to it. bracers are teh most common, Gloves are teh least common and arms are pretty rare too they seem to drop more on the 5th floor<br>   warnings- look out for the slippery floor!! there is a huge pit in teh middle if you fall in there are stairs to climb but you aggro a ton of stuff by falling in, larger races have a very hard time getting up the stairs lol<br>   levels and classes needed- this floor doesnt take much a mid 30's druid and tank could wipe the whole floor if there careful<br><br>FLOOR 2- The library<br><br>Key mobs- The Angry Librarian (she drops the key to the 3rd floor a teachers sylibus and a students homework these items are caster i think both range items i know the homewrok is for sure and goes for abotu 1k on the tunare server) the one time i got her to spawn we had to kill the entire floor before it happened seems shell spawn off of any mob shes not too tough though<br><br>its best on this floor to pull to where you zone. An enchanter comes in really ahndy on this floor. once youve pulled the first half of teh room and you ahve someoen who can cast invis to undead move to teh corridor across teh room from teh entrance and pull to there to get teh rest of teh room<br><br>cool loot- nothing to great here (cept teh stuff on teh angry librarian) ive heard of some crystal somethign or other armor but it doesnt look to great and after ownign the whole floor i never saw a single piece of it. <br><br>Entrance and exit- nothing importand about the entrance to this floor. the exit you have to click one of the bookcases i think its down the last corridor to the left but i cant tell you for sure wich book case it is (ive never had to exit of this floor) <br><br>Levels and classes needed- several times i have taken couger hunting groups from iceclad to this floor and things go pretty well i suggest that you have a chanter and an evacer if its your first time here cause the exit can be hard to find and to get to. im thinking full group of mid 30s can take it even just a chanter cleric and tank could probably do it.<br><br>Warnings- these mobs gate. And gate alot if your group isnt capable of stunning or blasting them at the end. ive never had a problem with them bringing back more than one or two friends but be prepaired.<br><br>FLOOR 3- this floor can be nasty if you dont have a map when you enter have your main puller take a right dont go too far cause stuff will aggro as soon as you move pretty much so have your tank clear a path down teh right corridor straight off that corridor is teh kitchen once youve cleared the room its  a good place to camp

floor<br><br>****- you enter here<br><br>--- door not sure whats behind it<br><br>XX -doorway (some of these may be fake walls)<br><br>XIX- defanitly a fake wall<br><br>....- path to get to 4th floor<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;- path to get to exit<br><br>V<br>^- secret wall marked with a tapestry<br><br>###- mirror to teh 4th floor<br><br>mobs on this floor are much harder than the 2nd if your in trouble and you cant gate the mintue you even think you might nto be able to handle something run for teh exit mirror and make sure your entire party will run the very second teh leader says RUN try to keep teh casters in front so they get to teh mirror first hate to say it but if a caster doesnt make the gate thats pretty much the end of teh line for them. after you clear the first hallway (marked hall1) if you hug the left wall pretty much nothing should aggro and if it does and your nto ready just make a straight run for wichever mirror your headed now if something aggros here and you cant handle it then your group defanitly will not serive the 4th floor so my suggestion just exit.<br><br>before going to teh 4th floor have your party buff and then med to full in front of teh 4th floor mirror marked ### <br><br>key mob- enraged shadow beast pretty sure he spawns in the kitchen<br><br>cool loot- dotn know much about loot on this floor =( its not a heck of an interesting place to camp but id asume that the cook or enraged cook drops soemthing good not sure what hes called. <br><br>Warnings- some stuff here is undead some is living so invis or invis to undead doesnt work thats what makes this floor so hard.<br><br>my map is very rough but the path to the exit mirror is very easy to find i found it for the first time by just running around looking  <br><br>***when you enter this floor have your part ready to back up to the wall theres lots of stuff that aggros right where you pop in***<br>FLOOR 4-<br>  i can not stress /assist enough here there tons of mobs close together on this floor an enchanter(or a very high level bard that knows what there doing) is an absalute MUST on this floor. have your chanter ready to mez as soon as the main tank calls for the first assist unless someoen has been here right before you you will ahve anywhere from 3- 7 mobs on you depending on how fast you get back to the wall. lots of stuff from this point on has dmg shields so have someoen ready to dispell, and with any dungeon to snare or root<br>   <br>main mobs- <br>   cara omica- drops the key to teh 5th floor<br>elmbalmers skinning knife (procs summon bandaids =D )<br>very very rare soreceress bowl- caster item<br>   narmak something or other-<br>Sk shield not sure on stats i think tis pretty good though<br>a melee class tome range item cood stats not bard usable not sure what other classes cant use i dont think rogues can either<br>   one more named mob not sure what it drops never seen it spawn amphetia or soemthing like that is what its called<br><br>you need a map to get to teh 5th floor from here there a ton of fake walls its liek a maze <br><br>FLOOR 5 - the wedding<br><br>simple have someoen single pull the ushers first<br><br>THE PATHING BUG-<br>   root your mobs cause as soon as they start to run away they dissapear and reaper at teh other end of teh hallway it can get nasty if you havtn rooted or snared.<br><br>after youve [ulled teh ushers you can either have that person pull the priest then nasja then daman or you can simply go in teh room and start killing them (if everyone is 45 and up theres not much in here that will aggro)<br><br>suggested killing order-<br>  priest, Nasja, Daman, the usher, undead dancers, then take out the 9 zombies <br><br>warnings- the pathing bug see above <br><br>BEWARE THE ENRAGED RELATIVE- he drops the key to teh next floor wow is this guy tough hits 100+ was red to me at 40 pretty sure hes teh highest level mob on the floor <br><br>well thats pretty much it ill add stuff later<br><br>ack sorry guys the message board doesnt show the map correctly =( its sorta fixed had to fill all the spaces inm with o's<br>&nbsp;<br>

Dunno if necros can summon pets to them. /shrug<br><br>Also, you don't always "go up" when you mirror, keep eye on /loc, the Z axis stays the same, so things from top and bottom floor won't attack you if you use AE. Its basically just a big flat zone, with teleports. At least thats the way I understand it.<br><br>If you do mirror while something is beating on you, it will come thru with you.<br><br>Also, someone was saying that there are no defined "levels", well if you identify the keys, they says like "Level 4 Key" and stuff, so there are levels :)<br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Terrisina is a joke if you know how to kill her.  If you have her key, skip to the top of the tower, buff up, and start pulling the room.  The first pull is made by walking out on the bridge *only lvl 51+ otherwise the whole room will come* 2 mob's will come from this first pull, kill these *most likely shaded torches*.  Kill the 2 mobs to your bottom left, then drop down into that corner, the room is on about a 1/2 hour spawn timer, so u have plenty of time. Solo pulling is easy.  Pull untill the room is clear, then have the cleric cast MR on everyone *including pet's!!!!!* and pull a bat. kill it, if terrisina spawns, kill her, just CH the tank a few times and she's cake.  If not, pull one more bat, then med up for room repop.  Kill the room again, then pull the remaining 2 bats... From my experience in the tower She will be one of the 4 bats... HOWEVER she seems to be a little more rare now.  So you might have to wait for a bat respawn, if she isn't in the first 4 bat's you kill, she WILL be in the next four. to get out just go up the stairs thru the locked door, and zone... Easy as cake. there are sever pathing bug's up there also, so be carefull.<br><br>54 necro <br>7th hammer<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've spent a fair amount of time in ToFS and I'm going to post everything I know about the zone, divided up by level.<br><br>Generic:<br><br>Each level contains at least 2 mirrors.  One mirror leads to Iceclad and does not require a key.  Each person must click on it individualy to exit the tower.  One mirror leads to the next floor (exception, 6th floor, see below).  Only the person with the key needs to click on the mirror.<br><br>Pathing, by and large, is very good here.  However, we have on occasion been attacked by mobs from a different floor than the one we are on.  Fortunately, they don't attack through the floor, but somehow show up on the wrong floor.  This leads us to speculate that going through the mirrors while mobs are still aggro is a bad idea.<br><br>1st floor:<br><br>Here you will fight lesser ice shades (spectres), shadowbones (skele's) and fading shadow guards (drolvargs).  All mobs on this floor are undead.  Nothing will aggro you as you zone in.  Down the hall you come to the main room.  Here the floor is very slick and there is a pit in the center of the room containing several shadowbones, so be carefull.  There are 6 passages leading out of the main room.  The zone out mirror is right where you zone in.  The mirror leading to level 2 is down the right hand passage on the back wall of the main room.<br><br>To get the key to lvl 2, kill everything you see until an enlarged shadow beast spawns.  It will spawn from the corpse of a random mob.<br><br>There are other minor drops on this floor, but nothing worth camping.<br><br>2nd Floor: This is one of my favorite floors in ToFS.  A mid 30's group can make good xp here and there are a pair of very nice drops to be had.  Once again, the zone in are is a safe area, no spawns and no wandering mobs to deal with.  This level resembles a library, full of ghosts.  Every mob here is undead.<br><br>As you zone in, you'll see a counter.  Behind the counter is the Librarian and Librarian's Assitant.  The Librarian is the toughest "normal" mob you'll fight here.  Like all mobs on this lvl, these 2 are casters.  <br><br>To the left is a small room with a ghostly teacher and ghostly student.  The teacher is probably the second toughest "normal" mob here.  The rest of the room is full of ghostly students and ghostly scholars.  The scholars are tougher than the students. <br><br>There is a rare spawn on this floor named Zorgliim the undead.  He's an undead dorf that has no drops that I'm aware of, but is higher lvl than most of the mobs on this lvl.  He can spawn in place of any mob.<br><br>The keyholder on this floor is the "angry librarian" who will spawn randomly from a mob right as you kill it.  The angry librarian will also drop either "students homework", or "Teacher's Syllabus".<br><br>The mirror to the next level is down a small passage straight out the back of the room.  The zone out mirror is behind a secret door.  Go to the back of the room and turn left.  The last bookshelf on the right side is really a door.  Click on it to open it, walk down the hall.  There's the zone out mirror.<br><br>3rd floor:<br>In my opinion, this floor isn't worth hunting other than to get the key for the next floor.<br><br>Half the mobs here are undead.  Armored shadows are not.  This makes movement a bit of a pain.  In addition, there is an armored shadow that wanders near the zone in point.  Generaly we cast regular invis before zoning in to the 3rd floor.<br><br>Mobs here have WAY too many hp's for their lvl making xp hunting here just silly.  The key is dropped by an enraged shadow beast, who will spawn from the death of a random mob.  The enraged shadow beast will also sometimes drop a finely crafted velium ring (fairly nice for melee's).  <br><br><br>We have found no easy way to set up camp here.  There are a few wandering armored shadows.  Kill until you get the key, then move on.  I also cannot adequately describe how to get to the mirrors and would suggest you find a map before going to this floor, unless you share my adventurous spirit.  In general terms, the mirror in the zombie maid's room is the zone out mirror.  The mirror to the next level is at the end of a hall with no mobs in it.<br><br>4th floor:<br>Another fun level with some nice drops.  I STRONGLY reccomend you stay on the path I lay out for you, else risk falling through a secret floor into a pit.  If you do fall into the pit, click the gem in the middle and you will port back to the zone in point.<br><br>The zone in point here is not safe, there are at least two wandering mobs that path past here.  Some are undead, some not.  We normaly use regular invis to port in and then quickly move to our camp spot unless aggro'd immediately.<br><br>As you zone in, there is a locked door to the right.  The key to get to the fourth floor is also the key to the door.  Down the end of that hall is the zone out mirror.<br><br>To camp the key, don't open the locked door.  Take the first right past the locked door and go down the hall.  Take the first right into a small dead end passage.  In this passage will either be an ancient mummy or Amanhotep.  Amanhotep drops either the sparkling soul necklace or the scroll of prophecy.  He also triggers Cara Omica, the keyholder for the lvl.<br><br>If Amanhotep is not there, kill the mummy.  Set up camp here.  Have your puller go out and to the right, continuing down the hall you were in.  The first mob he'll come to is "a shadow" (unless he finds a wanderer first).  Shadow's are casters and are a pain in the ass because they are tough to target.  On multiple pulls, I reccomend ALWAYS taking the shadows first, simply because your 'chanter will have trouble targeting them to remez.  Have you puller continue to pull mobs from the hall, working his way down the hall.  Just before the hall "dead ends" there are 3 more shadows.  This is, in fact, not a dead end.  It's a false wall.  On the other side of the wall are 2 more shadows.  Past that is a large room where Cara Omica spawns once the named mummy has been killed.  Have your puller pull all the way to Cara's spawn point.  Often times we've zoned in, set up camp, pulled this far to find that Cara is up (most likely someone prior to us killed the mummy but not Cara)<br><br>In addition to dropping the key to the next floor, Cara drops the Enbalmers Skinning Knife (common) and has 2 rare drops: the Magnetic Dirk of Distraction and the Sorcerous Bowl.  <br><br>Past Cara there are 5 more shadow spawns and then the mirror to the 5th floor.<br><br>Often we spend a little extra time on the 4th floor because the drops are kinda nice and the xp is pretty good up until 45 or so.  There are two other named mobs. Narmak is a named armored shadow that drops a book for tanks (range slot) and shield for SK's.  Maggot Infested Ooze drops Maggot Infested Flesh (presumably for an unsolved quest).<br><br>5th Floor:<br>All mobs here are undead.  Most are lower lvl than mobs on the 4th floor.  In fact, if your party is strong enough to get here, most of the mobs here will probably be green to you.  The zone in point is safe.  You'll be in a hall, with 8 Golem ushers in cubicles (4 on each side).  They are almost the only thing that still gives xp at lvl 45.  Pull them and kill them, the proceed into the main room, where the wedding is taking place.  Most of the mobs here can be killed w/out aggroing any of the other mobs in the room.  Everything is named, but only Daman (bride) and Nosja (groom) drop anything worhtwhile (supposedly, I've yet to see the nicer drops).  They have 3 drops, a veil for enchanters and 2 rings (one for int casters, one for melee types, I've only ever seen the veil).  They also drop the Ceremonial Wedding Sword and a "signet ring".  Both are presumably for unsolved quests.<br><br>The keyholder here is an enraged relative (spectre type).  Once again, he'll spawn from the body of a dead mob.  He also sometimes drops the spiked velium helm.<br><br>The zone out mirror is in the zone in area.  The mirror to the next level is down a small tunnel around behind the wedding room, guarded by two more golem ushers.<br><br>6th floor:<br>There are 2 main types of mobs here, icy shades (spectres) and shadow guardians (drolvargs).  Guardians have way too many hp's, but other than that are relatively easy to kill.  Xp here can be decent with a good group chain pulling.  The zone in line is mob free, so it's safe to zone in and then buff up.  Taking the second right from the zone in, and turning right again will take you to the spawn point for the incoherent spirit.  His death triggers the lucid spirit of Abrams.<br><br>Taking the second left (instead of right) takes you to a room full of shades... be carefull, the floor itself will attack you here.  If you're gonna pull this room, do it with ranged attacks from outside the room itself.<br><br>Taking the first right will lead you down a corridor.  On either side of the corridor are cubby holes w/ drolvargs in them.  at the end of the corridor is a stair case.  This leads to more doggies, and then a balcony.  Stay back from the edge, if you get too close, you'll aggro the spectres in the room below.  Just past the balcony is a mirror.  Each party member must click this mirror seperately to go to what is commonly called floor 6b.  It's where Val sherra, the key holder, spawns.<br><br>Val Sherra SEEMS to be a triggered spawn, however what triggers him remains unclear.  For us he popped up on track after killing one of the Drolvargs.  A friend reported something similar upon killing a shade.  Sound like it's fairly random.<br><br>When you zone into val's room, there will be a wandering shade bat.  Kill this first.  Be warned that it has a spell that will drain all of your stamina.  When it dies, an enraged vampire will spawn.  Male vampires are melee type, females are casters.  Again, WAY too many hp's for their lvl, but what can ya do.  After killing the vamp, buff up.  Make sure you put up your resistance buffs, Valsherra is a caster, and like many high lvl casters he draws his spells from several classes.  However, his main line of spells seem to be necro spells, so expect to be poisoned and diseased.  He also has a form of charm (called vampiric charm).<br><br>Send your puller up the ramp.  Unless he's higher than lvl 52, he will likely pull 3-4 bats along with valsherra.  When we killed Valsherra, we had the chanter mez the bats while we tanked the efreeti.  Be warned, Val will gate at low health, so get your stuns ready.<br><br>In addition to the key, Valsherra also drops some cruddy jewelry (an earring and a talisman).  In the back of the room is a mirror... clicking that mirror will port the party back to the zone in point for the 6th floor.  Up the ramp into the room Valsherra spawns and through the tunnel in back you'll find a hand holding a gem.  THIS is the "mirror" to the next lvl.  I do not know where the zone out mirror is on the 6th floor.<br><br>7th floor:  The zone in mobs here are not undead and invis works fine.  Bypass them and proceed until you come to a room with 2 drakes.  These drakes see through both invis and ITU.  They are not affected by undead type spells.  From here out, you'll have to kill everything.  Kill the drakes.  Take either passage out of the room (they both go to the same place.)<br><br>You'll arrive in a large room with a spiral staircase.  In this room are a few more drakes and a bunch of "shaded torches".  The torches proc a steal strength spell and are a royal pain in the neck.  Kill all the drakes and the torches.<br><br>The wall in the back of the room is a false wall.  It leads to a corridor with 5 rooms.  In each room is a shrouded bat.  Upon dying either an enraged vampire or Tserrina will spawn.<br><br>Be warned that these mobs are higly magic resistant and will run.  It's important to clear all the drakes and torches in the main room, then KEEP them clear or your likely to have a lot of adds on your hands, since it's so tough to stop mobs from running.<br><br>I can't comment on Tserrina since when we hunted here, she never spawned for us.<br><br>Up the spiral stair case is a locked door.  You need Valsherra's key to open it.  This leads to a room with a bunch of mirrors.  Click to zone out.<br><br>Hope this info helps.<br>&nbsp;<br>Keadaian Songborne<br>Guild Leader<br>Promethian Order<br>Vazealle</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>For the 3rd floor I'd suggest camping in the kitchen.  Turn right as you zone into this level and head all the way down.  May need to fight on the way and will need to clear the room.  But it's a nice large staging area without wandering mobs, just the room pops.  <br>On the 4th floor we tend to camp in Cara's room while pulling the rest of the floor to us.  DMF or levitate your puller, floor traps are annoying.  We've seen Cara spawn after ever kill of Amon the named mummy.  She's had the key and the bandage summoning dagger all 4 times I've killed her.<br><br>5th floor is a joke if you got through 4 without any problems.  Most stuff ends up green :(  We saw the angry relative 3 times out of 4 off an Usher death.  Our enchanter got a 'that spell will not effect this creature' message when attempting to Mez out the Usher the Enraged relative popped out of.  Did not get that message on any others.  We hit a bug on zone into this floor though, party member got sent outside the tower instead of the next floor when group leader clicked the key.  The rest of the group made it.  I think it was possibly because too many people in the zone in point.  Other group that went first was still standin there.  It might have thrown her to the side and into the exit mirror that's right next to the zone in point for the 5th floor.<br><br>On 6A you can track stuff on 6B, so you can know when keyholder is triggered.  I can verify the 'hugging the left wall to avoid the floor trap' works. ;)  Trap can get you on the stairs and right in the front hallway into this room too.  Pet control up here is a bit of a bitch, pathing makes them run wide to attack a mob, so watch out.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Fenira Jormungundr<br>Judge of Ice<br>Proud Member of the Sacred Brotherhood of the Wolf</td></tr>
