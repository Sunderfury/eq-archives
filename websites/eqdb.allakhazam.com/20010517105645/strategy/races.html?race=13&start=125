Currently, I'm amiable with Felwithe, Kelethin guards/rangers/druids, Rivervale, Qeynos guards/paladins/clerics/vendors, Ak'Anon, Fironia Vie, and Freeport militia; warmly with the Ashen Order, Silent Fist, FP paladins, High Hold guards/merchants; and dubious with several other factions including Ogguk and Grobb guards. Takes a long time and a lot of killing (much more than it did for my ogre...), but it is possible to get good faction just about everywhere. Prap's I'll post a guide on faction raising sometime when I have a bit more free time. Anyone have any ideas on how to raise Erudin and Hallas faction? Those two and Neriak are the only towns left, and methinks my Neriak faction was ruined moreso than it already was from killing a few hundred too many orcs...

	   <tr><td colspan=2>are you sure that Iksar Shaman dont have it as hard? We are still the same race and we both worship Cazic - Thule... the class on its own has nothing to do with it.. Shaman are not KOS by default like Necromancers and SKs are... play a barbarian shaman you'll know what I mean. Shaman fall into the same category as Rogues.. they are not "disliked" by, say, the freeport merchants.. they are "mistrusted" is. they will not be KOS to guards and they will be able to bank but some merchants will simply refuse to sell to them. It more annoying than anything. The smith in the Qeynos forgery is like this. He doesnt like high elf mages or halfling druids.... well NO ONE likes halfling druids ;) <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Nahualli Uoxtitla <br>Elementalist of the 52nd Summon<br>Symphonic Oblivion<br>Tarew Marr</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>FP faction, eh? I started out by raising the FP militia faction, which I did by turning in vast amounts of orc/gnoll scalps and goblin ears to the captains in HPH and HK. Took quite a few of 'em, you can also do it by getting a wolf form and turning in deathfist slashed belts to some guy in the militia house I've heard, haven't tried it though. After raising that, I killed many many many deathfist orcs, which raised paladin and monk faction. Once you get high enough with the monks to do the sash quests, you can do the first sash quest about 40 times to get warmly with 'em. So far, the only way I've found to raise faction with the arcane scientists is by turning in rat ears to some guy (his name escapes me at present) in Qeynos Hills. I started out dubious with the necros/SKs/rogues so I didn't bother with those factions. I think I raised the cleric guild faction by doing some paladin quest, can't remember which one right now, was a while ago... I think that's all of the factions, excluding the FP vendors. I always just sneak to sell to 'em, but I *believe* that turning in orc pawn picks to that guy in (east?) FP raises it, Qeynos merchant, and human rogue faction. You'll probably want to look most of these quests up on a website since I can't recall most of the names of the quest NPCs. <br><br>This was a bit easier as a monk, since I have the ability to sneak (raises your faction to indifferent if you approach a mob from it's back), than it was as the other evil races I've played which didn't have that ability. I'm pretty sure it's still possible to do this without sneak though, might need a friend who's high enough to cast some faction boosting spells for a couple of the quests though. Let me know if I left any of the factions out. Hope this helps. Ta.<br>&nbsp;<br>~~Aeglos Fayfist of Xegony~~<br>Scaled Monkey of the Lost Circle</td></tr>

Sounds like if you can get past the guards, you'll be able to transact with the merchants just fine.  If you can invis, you might be able to get to the Library and give wine to Lokar.  Giving him wine raises factions with the Dread Guard and the Bargainers.  I'm just afraid that you'll have to give him quite a lot, but I don't know if that will be sufficient if you're KOS.  You may have an easier time in Grobb, Ogguk, or Paineel.  Paineel especially shouldn't be that hard, since the religion faction is the same, so it's all just racial and should be easier to overcome.  Granted, I have seen Erudite necros in Neriak, so I know it's possible, I'm just not sure how you'd have to do it, without going into the city.<br>&nbsp;<br>Androsulach Phlithvelve, Shadowknight of Innoruuk.<br>Nation of Eridine</td></tr>

Necros get the regen for their mana(to necromancers health = mana mana = health, read my iksar necro guide 4.5 baby whoo hoo) In addition the armor availabe to the necros is usually not limited to the original races, So the armor disadvantage is not so severe. Shamans are often early on forced to tank, really useful at low levels, and iksar shaman start with a HUGE amount of wisdom, whats not to like their, it will help alot in those later levels when you don't need the large number of wis items in the game, you need HP and AC ;) .

	   <tr><td colspan=2>While Your post has merits, Other things need to be mentioned.<br><br>For you beginning warriors, shaman, and shadowknights, ANYONE for that matter, it is ill-advised to use the newbie weapons for long.<br><br>During the first several Levels of an iksars life we will be leveling up much faster than any other race and class Period.  Congrats for buying the expansion pack when you could ;) <br><br>With this super fast leveling comes an equally "difficult" challenge of keeping your weapon skills up.  Gordon said that DEX is responsible for the advancement of weapon skills, and While In my experience it doesn't seem completely accurate (ie: more to it) I definatly see slow weapon skill advancement for us iksars.  If you follow the advice of say eq.castersrealm.com you would have selected 5 points into dex, a fine choice.  Perhaps even more is warrented, but never underestimate the power of carrying more loot than other people / hitting harder than them ;)<br><br>I would recommend no one to use the newbie pike at first, unless you upgrade it early on, by questing for your next level pike as soon as you are able to. The next pike is 9dmg 46 delay and 2 ac, overall a better weapon than the shantok with just a slight amount of effort needed to accomplish this task, see the quest database under warriors to find this information out, you should probly be about 4th level before you do this quest.<br><br>Anyways I got a bit off what I was going to say, sorry, My advice to you warriors is to instead by a dagger at one of the merchants in the FOB and probly countless other newbie zones in Kunark, You know, the ones with survival staffs... Anyways this dagger is 3 dmg / 22 delay almost as good as magician summoned.<br><br>What??? has ezzlan lost his marbles even 8 / 46 is better than 3 / 22 .<br><br>Let me take you through some simple math to illustrate my point.  First you all know that until 20 there is a damage cap... That cap is double the damage of the weapon + 1<br><br>Therefore for a true comparison, the dagger is 7/22 while the pike is 8/46  (I wish I could do a data table)<br><br>With this +1 bonus on the dagger it is really not as much of a negative as one might think.  <br><br>Ok, also... As a warrior, perhaps you have been told the best weapons in the game are 1hslashing, and for the most part I would have to agree, however, there are awesome piercing and 2 hand slash weapons available, and if you happen to find one you are going to wish you had maxxed skill points in that area.<br><br>For example, even though the shan'tok has a slightly higher ratio than the upgraded pike, the pike would win because of the +2 ac  However, why not train both, because both are fine weapons and use different skills.  <br><br>Unfortunatly there is a lack of good 2handed weapons for us newbies in kunark, but thats ok, because as any non-large warrior can tell you it is often more important to use a shield for the benefit of bash, if not just for the extra AC in a damage heavy group (IE: monks and rogues galore)<br><br>Ok, so you are going to use your (perhaps its a sacrificial dagger) fast dagger to train, and a shan'tok for those close fights on yellows at level 5+<br><br>However, what if you have your upgraded Pike and close to full points in the Piercing skill, then things are reversed...  (Stupid random numbers)<br><br>Use your upgraded pike for those close fights, but use one of the other "fine quality" rusty weapons around, the feir'esh and the Tier'esh (or something similar to that) They have not quite the damage ratio of the Shan'tok, but a lower quality weapon at a skill of 25 would be much much more powerful than a high quality weapon at skill of 8.<br><br>But always realize, when I say poor damage ratio, remember you are using a heck of a lot better weapon that they are using on the mainland, so be proud and give praise to the great Cazic<br><br>New Iksar Warrior Convert, as well as player of every other class ;) (except wizards cuz they suck  hehe j/k)<br><br>Oh and btw I hope people read this even though its under a somewhat small post.<br><br>(oh and again I try to go for quality over quantity, but if you have any additions, feel free to tell me what weapons you have found around our fair city of cabilis) Or even better, could someone perhaps post a guide for the armor in the area, I'm currently using a mix and match set of the Raw Silk (the stuff sold in teh FOB)equivilent for us iksar, and a bit of curscale, waiting to go into kurns)<br>&nbsp;<br>Ezzlan 25th ENC Brell<br>Ninien ENC MT<br>and a bunch of others<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'm editing this the next day after what I wrote below.  Last night I checked out the elf island.  Verant has apparently changed the faction standings.  The elf had conned dubious to me last week is now ready to attack.  Once I realized that I was able to sneak around him so this route still works if you have access to sneak, invisibility, or levitation, but otherwise it's probably not practical until you're in the low 20's.<br>--------------------------------------<br>I'm editing this message the next day.  I tried this route again last night and for the first time ever I got killed on that elf island!  One of the elves in a building on the pier didn't like me and attacked.  I've traveled this way about 10-15 times including a previous time yesterday and two times earlier this week and this is the first time I was killed there.  I don't know if Verant changed the factions because they thought Iksar were having it too easy, if it was a fluke, or if they added another elf.  I'll try it again tonight and try to see how things go.  <br><br>If this fails then the only alternatives are via Overthere and Freeport or via teleport.  Since it isn't necessary to get off at the island on the way back to Kunark, it can still be used for returning.<br><br>Anyway, I just thought I should put in the warning.<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Hail!  I just found this board.<br><br>In my travels as an Iksar I often see Iksar going to Oasis via the Overthere but I don't see them going to Faydwer except via teleport.  My monk has been doing this since level 10 without resorting to teleport and I thought I'd pass along how I do it.  It's very tedious but except for one short stretch that all races have to go through it isn't particularly risky if you're careful.  It's actually possible to go to Oasis and then take the boat from Freeport to Butcherblock (I've done that too) but I'm going to describe using the boat from Firiona Vie to Butcherblock starting at Cabilis.<br><br>1.  Enter the Lake of Ill Omen.  It's behind the arena in Cabilis.  <br><br>2.  Follow the left mountain range until you reach a stream.  Follow that stream to the left until you zone into Firiona Vie.<br><br>3.  Prepare for the only really dangerous leg of this journey.  There are frequently high level groups just inside the Firiona Vie zone.  The next part of the trip will be a LOT safer if you can get them to make you invisible.  It's still doable without being invisible though.  If you can sneak or have any other way of reducing a monster's aggro radius by all means use it.<br><br>4.  CAREFULLY follow the stream to the sea avoiding the drachnids.  If you're low level you will almost certainly die if they see you so be careful.  SOW never did me much good -- they just cut me down from behind with their spells.  My monk uses sneak in this part.  At least it's short and is the only truly dangerous part of the journey.  After various disasters I now only do this during the day because I can see the drachnids easier.  Take whatever time you need to sneak past them even if that means making detours or waiting until one walks away.  I assure you that waiting for it to walk away is a lot quicker then running back to recover your corpse.  On the other hand you do want to get out of this stretch as soon as you can so don't dawdle.  If you sneak and are very careful you'll probably be fine. <br><br>5.  When you reach the ocean swim around the good outpost giving it a WIDE berth.<br><br>6.  When you reach the pier where the boat ties up and if the boat isn't there go past the pier.  There's a ladder up from the water a couple hundred feet back which you can reach if you approach it from away from the pier.  It's a good place to rest while waiting for the ship.<br><br>7.  When the ship arrives you can ride on either the bow or the rudder. If you have levitate you might be able to get on deck in which case you'll be able to skip the next step and arrive much sooner then you would otherwise.  I've never done it with levitate though.  If you're on the bow or rudder I'd suggest not moving around because it's very easy to fall off.<br><br>8.  The ship will eventually leave and zone into the Timorous Deep.  It will stop at an island in that zone and you'll have to get off if you weren't able to get onto the deck.  Just wait until you see the shuttle coming out to the boat on the port (that's left) side. Jump off the boat and swim ashore.  Run around to the pier and get back on the shuttle (which will have returned by the time you get there).  This is necessary because you have to be ON the deck of the ship for the next step to get into Butcherblock.  There are wood elves along the pier but I was not KoS to them. YOur mileage may differ so I'd suggest /conning them before walking past them.<br><br>9.  After the ship goes all the way around it's circuit and is again back to the island (I TOLD you this was tedius) ride the shuttle out to the ship like any other passenger and get on deck.<br><br>10. Eventually the ship will again stop and the shuttles from Butcherblock will arrive.  Get on one.  After it zones into Butcherblock but before it arrives at the dock jump off and swim ashore.<br><br>Congratulations! You made it.<br><br>The trip back is pretty much the reverse.  However there is one thing to keep in mind.<br><br>To get back on the shuttle at Butcherblock you'll have to navigate the dock area.  The dwarf at the foot of the pier for the shuttles will kill you if you get too close as will most of the merchants in the buildings.  I swim to the middle of the dock area and then sneak to the wall by the pier using a path which goes midway between that dwarf and the buildings.  Once I'm at the wall I hug it and go up the pier on the left side, getting onto one of the left shuttles.<br><br>You won't be doing any of that nonsense of getting off at an intermediate island and then back on when heading back.  Just go straight to Firiona Vie and jump off the ship when it docks on the side away from the pier.<br><br>Also, when doing the return direction through Firiona Vie there is one spot where the drachnids appear to not be visible until they "pop" into view when you're practically on top of them.  This is bad.  To avoid it, when you first start sneaking past them do NOT start right next to the stream, instead start a ways to the left as you're facing the land from the sea.<br><br>I've used this route several times and once I figured out the dangerous spots it's become fairly routine.<br><br>Gilasil of Xegony<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Gilasil of Xegony</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have done this route MANY times.  The one time I was killed by a guard when swimming in Firiona Vie was when I didn't give the wall wide enough berth.  In that case I got a good character to drag my corpse far enough away so I could loot it (dragging works fine when swimming).<br><br>Perhaps I didn't emphasize this enough.  You really have to give it lots of room.  I normally hug the west zone wall until my north-south loc is at least -5000 then go due east.  In fact just to be safe I often make it -5300 or so.<br><br>So it works fine and that part is quite safe but you really want to keep a lot of space between yourself and the wall.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gilasil of Xegony</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>So you want to be feared and loved by many at the same time, congratulations on choosing the Iksar Necromancer.<br><br>First I have to mention, The Intelligence is low for Iksar, this is THE primary stat for us, Put as much as you can into this Stat, but this is not a general necromancer starting guide for that go to eq.castersrealm.com<br><br>However.... Humans have been getting to Level 50+ as necromancers for a long time, Intelligence is one of the easiest stats to increase, so you won't have too much difficulty getting there, but more so than say an erudite. Where they get AC and HP Items once at 200 INT, we iksar have High AC already so this offsets this.<br><br>Now, on to other issues, Iksars have health Regen, Necromancers Have mana Regen that drains life, Its a perfect match, the Iksar regen coupled with the Call of Bones Series gives you a benefit greater than definatly breeze and even better than clarity, now... where the other races enjoy getting clarity or breeze casted on them so they don't have to worry about their hp draining, so instead of casting low efficiency lifetaps, you can cast your higher efficiency DOTS.<br><br>Necromancers life is about efficiency, To us MANA is HP, Mana is HP, and Enemy's life is our Own, but only because HP is Mana. Its a never ending cycle. Now... People who dislike iksar often don't realize that just like trolls the regen gets better over time, so increased efficiency results.<br><br>Now... As for the higher AC this is a huge benefit, if you decide to solo (stupid choice imho) or choose to go in a small group of say 2 or 3 (necro's are awesome for this) you may have to take a few hits to keep your Pet or Tank alive, We can do this better than Any other Race. <br><br>For Equipment, We can do our Temple of Solusk Ro Quests with little to no problem, So don't worry about that. Shadowbound Equipment is the best caster equip for the level.<br>Our Quests for Skullcaps are not that Great of an item, but better than what other casters get (nothing) and even at really high levels there is a lack of decent INT items for the head slot.<br><br>Now regarding what I said Earlier about efficiency, Perhaps you know this from playing that a good group consists of a tank to absorb damage, a healer, and an enchanter, we necromancers can do a bit of all 3 of those, and compliment them if your group already has all 3, its a wonderful class. Now... we lack INT but that is ok, because It is very very rare to have FM when you are grouping, if you do then your group is not pulling enough and get a new place or puller. Our Lower INT does not effect our mana Regen Rate, so we regain mana at the same speed as everyone else. But we don't regain at the same as everyone else, we gain FASTER. WHY do you think enchanters are popular, THEY MAKE PEOPLE GET MANA FASTER, we get mana faster on our own. Everyone in your group will benefit from you not having to med for mana as much.<br><br>As for starting location cabilis is wonderful, you never have to leave kunark, except for shadowbound quests. However... If you do the necromancer is the most suited for this, invisiblity helps you get around better than the other classes.<br><br>Being KOS everywhere sucks, but there is always anewbie to ATM you or buy food or spells for you, c'mon to them 1pp is god, to you it is chump change.<br><br>also regarding zones, the spiders in the Pit area (see a Field of Bone guide for this) might be heavily hunted, but at the same time this enables you to get raw silk armor earlier than any other casting class, further increasing your power over the other races.  Unfortunatly teens level in Kunark are not that great, but they suck for everyone in the world, our power helps us get out of theese zones quicker than the others.<br><br>Now... The one "problem" with iksar is their exp penalty, but think about it this way, its the same as a troll. And with ALL of the bonuses we recieve from the AC to the health Regen, More than makes up from that. I've had many many characters make it into the teens and above, The Iksar Necromancer was able to do it the fastest, and wind up with the best stuff at the end.<br><br>Oh yes not to mention kurns is a great safe dungeon full of undead right near where we start, and Sabertooth tigers (soloable around 12 better at 13) drop 1pp fangs. <br><br>We necromancers get all the benefits of the iksar, and don't have to worry about missing good plate armor like our warriors and even shaman do.<br><br>Did I meantion also that we have awesome swimming.<br><br>I hope you liked this guide<br>&nbsp;<br>Ezzlan 25th ENC Brell<br>Ninien ENC MT<br>and a bunch of others<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ezzlan, I read up some and noticed the hp rate of an iskar is 3hp per tick, right? Does the regneration rate change over levels or training? Does this equally factor with the hp decrease of a necromancer hp/mana exchange? Sorry if I am sounding like a moron here, I have not even played EQ yet but own the game and am planning to get suscribed today or tomorrow. ANyway, So how does the +3hp regn and the -# hp/mana exchange work out? Do you come out - or + or neither or what? Also, the EXP difference between a human and an iskar can end up millions upon millions of exp!!!! is this worth it? Also, can an iskar use all types of armor/weapons than other necromancers, or what types then? And, does every city in EQ hate you for being a iskar?!! that totally blows in my opinion, the evil cities should at least like iskar, do they? What types of skills do Iskar gain over DarkElves or lose compaired to DarkElves? THANK YOU PLEASE REPLY ASAP!!!<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Levels 1-3.<br><br>   You've just spawned in East Cabilis, you have a short sword, some food/drink, and a book of discord. First drop or destroy that book since there is no Priest of Discord in Cabilis. Second read your note, after reading your note, you want to head towards the large castle nearby, which holds the shadowknight and shaman guilds. Be sure to avoid the froglok slaves while you are in the city, they are yellow to you, attack on site, and the guards will not help you with them.<br><br>   Once inside the castle you will notice two sections of wall that look checkered and blink, those are teleporters to the top floor, which is the shadow knight section, take one. Now on the second floor enter the large room next to you with the ladder going up. Climb the ladder, stand on the top face away from the wall and jump to the floor nearby. Then climb the large wooden ladder and our guildmaster will be on a balcony directly in front of you. Hand in your note, recieve your Khukri, then proceed to gather the quests from Gikzic who is near our guildmaster.  Gikzic will give you a bag and tell you to fill it with the heads of four sarnak hatchlings, hold on to the bag for now.<br><br>   Now that you've been given your first quest you are ready to head out into the world. Head for the southeastern corner of East Cabilis and enter the Swamp of No Hope.<br><br>   I choose the swamp for 2 reasons.<br>   1. Less competition for kills from other newbies<br>   2. Less lag<br><br>   Once inside the Swamp head straight out until you come to a road and some large pillars. Hunt in the area between the water, hill, city ruins, and pillars.<br><br>   Kill Mosquitoes, swamp leeches, and decaying skeletons until lv 2, at which point you expand to the occasional even giant swamp leech and lone froglok tads(which you need to becareful of, since they swarm). Once you reach level 3 head out to the Lake of Ill Omen.<br><br>   To get to the lake once you enter back into East Cabilis go west(or straight ahead) into a tunnel which zones into West Cabilis. Once in West Cabilis follow the tunnel until you reach an island in the water with a little tent, from there you want to go left(or south) down another tunnel, they will lead to a wooden dock, and an area with two rows of large iksar statues. Be warned that is the arena area, so don't dilly dally in the center of it. If you follow the right wall past the pvp area, you will come to a cavern that leads to the Lake.<br><br><br>Levels 3-6<br><br>   Ok now you've entered the Lake of Ill Omen, and are ready to get yourself some sarnak heads, but first you must find one to kill. So what you do is head left from the city towards the grass, which is the newbie area for this zone. <br><br>   Hang around the left side of the newbie area and kill any sabertooth kittens, goblin whelps, decaying skeletons and the occasional even con sarnak hatchling(who yeilds the heads you need). Once you reach level 4 widen your selection to even Sabertooh cubs, goblin scouts, goblin watchers, and most sarnaks. Sometime between now and 5 you should gather enough heads to recieve your next Khukri, once you do head back and complete the quest then return here and continue leveling until you reach 6.<br><br>   Once you get level 6 head back to the guild and train bash. Then if you haven't already aquired a shield do so now.<br><br>  Once lv 6 and trained in bash, head out to the Field of Bone.<br><br>Levels 6-9<br><br>   Once in the Field, head straight out and follow the road until you reach the entrance of the pit(you'll know it when you see it).<br><br>  Now from here you have 2 options, continuing soloing like in your earlier levels, or start to group.<br><br> Option 1. Solo<br>   <br>  From  6-7 solo you will want to stay near the entrance, but a bit off to the side, so you will have the ability to make a break for it, or yell for help if your fights go badly, yet not be in the pathway of any trains that go up the ramp. <br><br>  Fight large scorpions, bonecrawlers, normal skeletons, or anything else in the area that cons blue to even.<br><br>  At 8-9 you will want to cross to the other side of the pit and pull from near the  large dragon skeleton to the wall near by. If you find yourself overwhelmed make a break for the city, but be sure to /shout Train! so you don't leave a trail of angry newbies in your wake.<br> <br> Stick with the same things you fought at 6 and 7, killing even cons and below.<br><br> Option 2. Group.<br><br>  Grouping takes a different approach.<br>  Use /ooc Shadow Knight Level (insert level) looking for a group levels (one level below you) - (one level above you).  Reasoning is so you still gain a decent amount of xp per kill. Try to keep your groups down to around 3-4 members max, to maximize the experience income.<br><br> Your group will probably be killing yellows and light reds non stop with relative ease, get a few groups like this and you will reach level 9 in day or two or even less.(Of casual 2-4 hour playtimes).<br><br>Level 9.<br><br>Once you hit 9 you will want to head back to the guild, train your magic skills, and buy your spells. If short on cash get your spells in this order.<br><br>1. Leering Corpse. Summons a level 4ish skeleton pet, but consumes 2 bone chips. Just always set it to /pet no taunt and it will just keep attacking whatever attacks you, working like a nice dot.<br>2. Siphon Strength. Drains 10 strength from the mob and gives it to you. The extra 10 strength nice atk boost, and lowers the mob's chances to do max damage on each hit.<br>3. Disease Cloud. 5 dmg, dot that does no real damage, but stops mob regen.<br>4. Lifetap. Drains 5 hp from the mob and heals you 5 hp. Useful for prolonging your life during those close fights.<br>5. Invisibility to Undead. Self describing, useful for traveling through heavy undead areas.<br>6. Locate corpse. Use without a target to point you in the direction of the nearest corpse. Used on self points you to your nearest corpse(never lose you corpse with this spell), used on another player, points you towards thier nearest corpse(find the corpse of a friend).<br>7. Sense the dead. Points you in the direction of the nearest undead creature. Useful for finding decaying skeletons when you need bone chips, but frequently it only targets another player's pet, or your own pet.<br><br>Thats basically it for levels 1-9 in the Cabilis Area.<br>&nbsp;<br>Eclipsis<br>Iksar Shadow Knight<br>Tunare<br>Shadow Strider<br>www.shadow-striders.com<br>www.tunare.com</td></tr>

It really sucks that I have to be careful going around town and be sure not to walk by certain people.  I have been able to bank in kaladim by hiding just around the corner from the banker so i can barely see him and i am able to bank that way.  there have been several occasions when i went into the bank to find him not inside his window and he attacked me when he saw me, pulling the guard into the battle as well.  I have also gained access to kelethin, but cannot bank there at all as far as i can tell.  the shape of the bank does not afford me any hiding places from which to bank.  I have not tried to gain faction yet in any other places.  Be warned all iksars or potential iksars, it is very hard and TIME CONSUMING to change your faction with different towns.  expect to die often and to be  somewhat disappointed with the results.  kermit the frog said that "it's not easy being green".  well we might not be green, but his message certainly applies to us.<br>Abbottmerk <br>18th season monk of the seventh hammer server<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'm not the one who figured this out so I cant take credit, but whoever did figure this out, we iksars owe you :)<br><br>   First take your Iksar over to east Freeport and into the caves underneath. Iksar start at dubious with the Freeport Rogues, Necros, and Shadowknights. Park your Iksar in the rogue area. <br><br>Next get a friend who is indifferent to the rogues or create a human rogue (have them worship Erollisi Marr so they start in Freeport).  Have them make 2 hotkeys.  #1 says "who are Janam and Rebby".  #2 says "what message".  You (or the nice friend) are now going to do 2 Note quests - Note to Janam and Note to Rebby.  <br><br>First Note quest is given by the female DE (Nestral T'Gaza I think) in the room near exit to seafarer's roost basement. Hail her and follow the prompts or Hotkey #1.  You get a note to take to Rebby in W Freeport, at the Theater of the Tranquil.  The second Note quest is given by the male dwarf (Harkin Duskfoot I think), and goes to Janam, who is standing right next to Rebby. <br><br>Janam gives a note to return back to the dwarf, and Rebby gives some whiskers to return to the DE. Both of these are not NO DROP, so you give them to your Iksar, and have them turn them in while sneaking to be at the necessary indifferent. This raises faction with FP militia, FP rogues, and FP merchants. Once you have done both quests about 50 to 60 times, you will be dubious to the militia, and can go above ground in east and west FP, and wander the Common lands.<br><br>The crappy part here is that the note to return to Harkin is a lore item, so you can only hold one.  This isnt so good if you are doing this quest yourself, as it means that you will have to do the first half of the quest, drop the items, log off, log on with your iksar and hand them in.  The Rebby whiskers, however,  are regular whiskers (they arent NO DROP or LORE) AND they are stackable, so I recommend that you do this quest at least 20 - 30 times first.  Then go back to where your iksar is drop the 20 - 30 whiskers and the one LORE note to Harkin, log off, log in with your iksar and hand em in.  Always remember to use sneak before you hand them in or else no faction for you. (do all iksar get sneak or only certain classes?  This may throw things for a bit of a loop if that is so)<br><br>Next you have to take your Iksar out into the Common lands and hunt Deathfist Orcs. This will raise faction with the ashen order monks, FP paladins, Rivervale guards, and Commons Residents.<br><br>WARNING: Hunt only the orc pawns and centurions. You get the same faction boost for these as for the tougher oracles, legionaries, and Shinree. However, your faction with DF orcs goes down more with the tougher guys, and so will bottom out your DF faction before your monk faction is high amiable. If your DF faction bottoms out, you will no longer get faction boosts with good guys. If this happens, you will have to let a DF orc kill you, which does something to DF faction, so you can start killing orcs for good faction again. There is no other way to raise your DF faction that I know of, so you have been warned.<br><br>This will eventually get you to high amiable with the monks, at which point you can do the white sash quest to raise your faction higher. The white sash quest uses one bone chip, one snake fang, and 2 orc pawn scalps. The sash quest raises monk faction, FP paladin faction, Qeynos monks, and some others.<br><br>In doing all of this, you will also be able to use the bank in north FP. At this point, the only places you will have to avoid in FP are the clerics temple, caster's guild, bard's guild, and possibly the warrior's guild.  <br><br>**Remember that North Freeport is off limits until you have killed ALOT of orcs.  I was being stupid and thought that the NPCs in N FP were the same as the ones in W FP, so I zoned in and got killed pretty quick.  I spent the next 2 hours trying to get several corpses back :(<br><br>As an alternative, if you have the money, you can pay a couple newbies x amount of gold or plat per note to harkin and rebby whisker that they bring your iksar.  Estimating that you can make a round trip to Janam and Rebby in about 4 minutes or so, that would be 15 notes to Harkin and 15 Rebby whiskers per hour, so if you had 3 or 4 newbies doing these for you, you could walk out after an hour or so and not be KOS.<br><br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Klok the monk (not the merchant)<br>Level 8<br>Nameless<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Around 9 or 10 you can start pulling to the base of Kurn's tower, zoning in when in trouble. I entered Kurn at about 10th or so and stayed till around 16 or 17, mostly. At some point I was able to easily solo the skellys, and even further I was able to take them in a bub or two of health. If you can do this, be daring and kill (near the zone of course!), bandage to half, kill, repeat...very fast leveling.<br><br>I then moved to Overthere. I prefer this to Lake, because the loot is incredible. Many times things will drop a plat or two and often drop an item that is worth a plat or more. I stayed here till around 21 or so and then moved into the Forest Giant fort in Warsliks. Here you can make even more money while gaining levels by selling the lucrative giants weapons to vendors. <br><br>When I reached around 26 or so I found the brutling ape things in the cave near Dalnir. I was not always able to solo them fully, but as a monk I could FD, and they are not agro...so attack, FD, bandage to half, repeat until dead. This process sailed me to and through my first hell level.<br><br>Then move inside Dalnir and work on getting your cresent armor and fighting batons. Dalnir is dangerous but very good experience and can take you easily to your next hell level at 35. It is probably then best to move back to Overthere to the FM side of it, and group. Also realize that from now on you will find it nearly impossible to solo.<br><br>Good luck!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I have followed the wall and most of the time was killed because i couldn't see the monster coming.  along the path there are mostly low-lovel monsters, 1-6, and a few skulkings.  Avois the skulkings because they hit pretty hard.  My computer is very laggy though so If I'm attacked by a monster much higher than me, I have no chance at all to run away, even with sow and plane clipping down.  After I reach over there, It is very easy, hop on the boat using the tilted barrel, and get going.  once you reach the docks, don't worry about the ogre, hes too far away from the docks to agro you, unless he's been pulled closer, then go left and wait for the barrel barge and go to oasis, but make sure to go directly to a bind sight.  Don't stop to kill ANYTHING, you could get agroed by specs or madman wizards, and even blue wizards are hard for non casters to beat.  If you die, type /who cleric 39 50 all because usually anyone over 50 is too stuck up to help newbies, and try to pick the closest cleric, If you don't need the xp back then do 29 30, then go up as you need to to find more.  give them a tell, and don't forget to mention you are an iksar who died in antonica and you are now in cabilis, this will raise your chance to getting a res alot better, tell them exactly where your corpse is,( you should remember) if you have a loc, even better,  and be nice.  Offer them money, If your low say "ill give you a whole lot of money". and when they ask how much, you say, I think i might be able to afford 10 platinum, and they will just do it for free most of the time.  WOW, this turned in to a HOW TO GET A RESURECTION<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I do something very similar but there are a few differences.<br><br>1.  My route through Warslick's woods is different.  You might want to get a map of that zone before starting.  As soon as I leave Cabilis I turn left (west) and more or less follow the wall.  I don't hug it (they seem to be discouraging that) but do stay reasonably close.  I try to pick paths which are less obscured by trees.  Most of the stuff I encounter here is green to my level 15 but it's not so dense that I can't avoid it once I'm away from the newbie area.  When my east-west coordinate is about 3200 I start traveling due north and turn on sneak.  The sneak isn't absolutely necessary but it does make things a bit safer since there are a few goblin battlemasters and such on this leg.  The trick is to cross the stream midway between the bandit lake and the ruins.  Once across the stream go around the base of the hill and then due west until you hit the zone.<br><br>2.  When swimming to the boat.  Climb up using the tilted barrels.  I use the one on the right rear of the boat.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>So you picked an Iksar? Well Kunark is probably new to you then and you are not sure where to go to level up.  You should start in the Field of Bone which the zone to is behind the big castle in East Cabilis. Swamp of no hope and Warsilks Woods are not good places to level but its possible. Lake of Ill Omen is ok for newbies but I still prefer Field of Bone.<br><br>For level 1 just kill scorpions, level 2-5 kill anything white or blue.<br><br>Once your at level 5 you can start going into the pit which is a big pit in the midle of Field of bone. The monsters stick to the middle so the outer wall is safe to sit and rest. Always pull what you want to attack to the wall. The side of the pit closest to Cabilis has the weakest mobs, the side near kurns tower has strong mobs so dont go wandering too far. I'd say past the dragon bones is where the strong mobs spawn but they can wander over to the weak side. Fight in small groups of two to three people, its faster then soloing. Be carefull of Iksar Bandits, Skeletons, and Scaled wolves there all agressive. Pull large scorps they are weaker then what they con but not much weaker and other scorps near you wont help unlike the beetles and spiders. Also sometimes the bandits and wolves will fight eachother so whoever wins the little fight you should pull beacause it will be weak.<br><br>Once your at level 12ish try the strong side of the pit in small groups again. Or you can try to fight in Kurn's Tower. Keep at it and you should make level 18 in no time. <br><br>At level 18 you can still get to 20 in Field of Bone, but Lake of Ill Omen is now a better choice. When you enter Lake from Cabilis just run strait til you hit the lake, but dont ever ever ever swim out in the  lake. There are level 40 Baracudas and level 45 goblins out there and there very agressive. Ok so when you get to the shore of the lake take a left and follow it til you cross a small stream.  Start Pulling anything you can handle to the shore or the wall by the stream. Do this for a few levels.<br><br>Once your level 23 or so start running around the lake til you see the sarnak fortress, keep running and look for a few colums sticking out of the lake. Thats where your going to pull the new mobs to. Pull Sabertooths icebones, Sarnaks, Iksar Pariahs, and anything else blue. I wouldnt solo here but small to medium size groups do well. You can get up to level 30 and beyond here. You can also go to warsilks woods and fight Wood Giants or Swamp of no hope and camp one of the camps there, but Lake is the easiest place to find people beacause Feriona Vie is only one zone away and many non-iksars hunt there too.<br><br>Since Im only level 32 I cant say much more. I go to Frontier Mountains often to get exp, but ive been going to Cazic Thule and the New Najena to get exp. Going to the main land is very annoying, there arent any banks you can use. <br>&nbsp;<br>Thrakazog SwiftScales<br>Level 43 Iksar Monk<br>Isengard of Saryrn</td></tr>

Vandalle (lvl 18 shadow knight)Iroth(level 18 ranger) and i rescued our little lizzard friend in the tunnels under freeport he was scared and cold and naked and weaponless (monks weaponless?) well he had just made the long trip from the field of bones but in his fear of death and loosing his Quest armor he hid them all in the bank.<br><br>and thus our journey began for making some robes to keep him warm and our journey began iksars from far and wide sent tells on paths and ways to recover money and riches in the bank and thus kusamotu (myself)learned of a secret bank under qeynos that evil aligned players goto. and we set off your percy was bound in west freeport then the long journey began... first major challange was when we hit HIGH PASS.<br><br>High Pass as we all know is a reletivly med level zone and your percy at lvl 10 had no busness fighting there. so we bound him at the start of zone. though trial and error we got young percy through the zone (some ranger who will go un-named forgot he had the camoflauge spell) well we got through ok then the horrors of east karana with the wildlife hungry to try lizard meat. we made bridge with little incident only a dead lion or 2 on path. <br><br>we zoned into north karana and seems we had an addition of an enchantress who her name slips my mind and pages of history will thank her for the 1 hour delay she caused us in asking us meet her by the other bridge... well we got to the bridge and well young percy's camaflouge wore off just as a guard decided to walk by and well ZAP!!! we had go back to high pass to get him... actually our resourcefull little lizard actually made it though east karana on his own (thank GAWD i bound him on other side of high pass)(on entering and once on exiting)<br><br>we our journey was un eventful for the next hour (real time whole trip actually from start through finish took us about 6 hours at least about 10 days of game clock time)  we made it to qeynos with only a dead warewolf to hinder us. we took young percy to the tunnel entrance in north qeynos and bound the entire group there.<br>we enter. first mistake if you're going to enter a zone that you're unfamiliar with best have someone who knows how to read maps lead the party.<br><br>well the 4 of us only young percy had a map and well its a maze that he was not able to disipher... well at this point is where we proceded to try to re-invent the wheel and remap this place each one with a pen and paper because our young monk was not skilled in the ways of reading maps :P sorry tom had to though it in... (since downloading maps i can understand why it was so difficult) percy found that a certain begger was KOS to him and tho it coned green to us would go nuts when he was anywhere near it  so he met his maker about 5 times... (you see at this point our enchanter friend had left and camaflauge only works outdoors. so this is where i go broke. there is for anyone who doesn't know a potion of invis sold in qeynos. 11pp a piece... well i bought about 5 of them gave them all to percy i gave everyone in group see invis and he quaffed... Vandalle our glorious leader led us though the laborynth till just short of bank where there was a mob that looked like the grim reaper who proceeded to kos any good char in group basicly i was hit for about 398 in 1 round by this thing. i boosted with my boosts and our ranger boosting i have about 244 hps well Percy at this point had his invis run out and well guess what those things that killed me and iroth were not kos to percy<br><br>1st thing not KOS to iksars since he left kunark.<br>(other then the swashbuckler in e-commons and 1st merchant) as Vandalle draged my body to me young brave percy recoverd his armor and proceeded to leave the tunnels and journey on to his next stop where he's at to date which is fighting in crushbone in hopes of someday being able to walk the tree city with me... but till then i'l be "LMAO" seeing a young iksar monk fighting crushbone orcs, giving money to newbies in exchange for food and water (no iksar has ever been able to raise forage so i have been told) and giving away crushbone belts to the more greedy amoung us. and that is the Tale you Percy and the quest for a bank.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
