	   <tr><td colspan=2>Samsheed,<br>No offense friend but I don't share your enthusiasm, and that may very well be because you started playing EQ early on and have been brain washed that these things happen.  But you know what I'm not buying it.  When a game is produced it should be playable from day one.  When I go to the store and drop $70 for a game then sign away a subscription for $15 a month  or more I expect at the very least that the darn thing works properly.  Anyone who tried playing in week one knows first hand how annoying that was, and although admittedly Funcom was fast and furious about improving game performance I am still not satisfied.  You are right that I could end my subscription, but everyone knows that I will never see my $70 again.  I feel disapointed that the game doesn't work well and feel like I was robbed of my initial investment.  Overall the experience was unpleasant.  If Funcom wants to take a financial bullet for it's subscribers, it may help them more financially in the end with customer satisfaction paying back in spades.  If Funcom could not produce a playable game, then they never should have released it in the first place.  If they ran out of money to finish it properly, that is their mistake.  Why should we the players and subscribers have to pay with our money and time for their inability to forsee the problems, that is their problem and their product and we are their customers who deserve satisfaction. <br><br>IMO<br>Sparrow<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I must just be lucky or something.  Or maybe my standards for what makes a game "playable" are a little different than others, I dunno.<br><br>My background:  Been running around EQ since barely a month after its launch, gone through heck and back with connection problems, but on the whole, nothing world-shaking.  Started with AO on July 4th.  My EQ time is generally every night during the week, and most weekends.  I only get into AO about every other weekend, but then I play about 8am-3pm Eastern.<br><br>So far, I've had a pretty good experience with the game.  I know that no product like this is going to be perfect "out of the box," so I do my best to be patient instead of going ballistic whenever it gets flaky.  I'll admit, logging in on the 4th of July, creating my character, and then as soon as I enter the training grounds getting "The servers are coming down now, please log out," did kind of irk me, especially since that day I only had about an hour and a half to play and really wanted to try AO out (didn't get into beta quick enough).  The patch time? 2 hours, natch. *shrug* Oh well, more time to study the manual better and learn more of the basic controls.<br><br>Got back in that Saturday, and had a pretty good time.  There were moments when lag got kinda rough, but I took advantage of it-- went over more of the in-game controls, read up and tested some of the emote animations (I don't know which made me laugh more, /disco or /moon *grin*), and generally fiddled around with settings.  I think it went pretty well-- learning everything from scratch, no gifts from any more advanced players, but I made level 6 in about 5 hours of play and only died once.  "Never enter a mission with only 24 bullets left if your only weapon is a slug-thrower, Sammy," I could hear the old men saying when I was reanimated.<br><br>There was ONE place where I had trouble with frame/lag that became irritating, and that was when I explored the main part of town looking for a Nano shop.  I got to close to what must have been the local "bazaar" because my FR went from smoothness to about 5 seconds per frame (no, I DIDN'T reverse that, I was moving in 5-second jerks by my screen).  Once I eventually stabilized back in the direction I had come from, I RAN away and didn't go back.<br><br>Overall, though, I have had a pretty good experience with the game.  Could it have gone better?  Sure, but you can test something like this to death and STILL not get everything ironed out until sometime AFTER it's released, simply because there's no substitute for trying it out for real.  The players after release can put in more man-hours in a single day than their whole company PLUS the beta testers could do in probably a week or more.  Wider range of system configurations, playing styles, thought processes that lead players to try different things in different ways (which is how most "exploit" bugs are found-- if the testers found 'em first, they'd have been corrected ahead of time, unless the tester who found it was unscrupulous enough to hide the fact from everyone, hoping for an advantage after release *shrug*), and just sheer numbers stressing the systems-- all stuff that's essentially impossible to duplicate in the closed environment of a beta test.<br><br>As for saying they should keep us in for free until they "get all the bugs out," how then do they make the money they need to recover their initial investment in developing the game AND the additional funds needed to keep things going AND pay their programmers, support staff, internal testers, etc. if they DON'T start the paid periods?  Bandwith and servers don't grow on trees, don't fall from the sky, and aren't left under the developer's pillows in exchange for teeth by some mythical fairy of MMORPG.  They've gotta be paid for, and the cash has to come from SOMEWHERE.  Of course, they COULD keep it free and keep going deeper and deeper into debt until they had the bugs worked out to everyone's satisfaction.  Then they'd just have to scale up their charge to recoup the losses at that point.<br><br>Am I the only one who'd rather go ahead and pay $12.95 now instead of having to pay $30, $50, $100 a month a while down the road?<br><br>Hey, if you're REALLY that put out by it all and don't want to pay for something "unplayable" (no, I'm not going to say "take it back"), close your account for a month or three, then come back and try again.  Why beat your brains out day after day trying to play if you feel it's unplayable?  Give 'em time to fix things up, and THEN try again.  Save yourself a whole lot of headaches and frustrations in the meantime.<br><br>Think.  Then think some more.  Then, if all questions are answered, consider how to act.<br><br>Samsheed<br>&nbsp;<br>Samsheed/MNK, Mahein/ENC, Memvarwen/BRD, Hisstesh/SHM, Sinestraln/SK, Tresk/ROG, From Rodcet Nife</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok. Thanks Allakhazam for opening up a discussion on this; I hope FUNCOM is listening.<br><br>a) The VAST MAJORITY of the playing public agree  that the game version now, as it stands, is relatively UNPLAYABLE. <br><br>b)Yes yes. Once you get OUTSIDE of the city, during the hours of 0230am to 0500am, the game gets less laggy. This is an opportune time to play for most people, I'm sure.<br><br>c)My first post was full of griping, as it should be. This post is serious- I can't understand or comprehend why they would activate our accounts while the game is, for MOST of us, still unplayable!(don't believe me please re-read all the message boards and enlighten yourself. No flamers here please...)<br><br>d)I would seriously like to know how this resolution is going to be solved, technically wise. We don't have a solid game, and we are being charged to Beta Test this final gold copy. Is this upsetting anyone else? I would LOVE to get through the city (Omni) and get to one of those lag less zones. GOOD LUCK! The hours I play are only 12am to 5pm! Gimme a f#@$ing break!<br>You mean I have to take baby steps for ten seconds through the city, crash, relog after five minutes, just so I can get to the outer boundaries of the city, mobbed by some high level clansman, and restart in the TRAINING AREA.<br><br>e)Yes, I am letting emotion determine what I write, but I feel that we SHOULD have learned something from EQ, UO, AC, Etc.. launches that were downright nasty. Really, all FUNCOM had to do was listen to the BTesters; AGAIN, IF YOU WISH TO FLAME ME, RE READ ALL THE MESSAGE BOARDS FROM BETA 2-4 ABOUT HOW ALL THE TESTERS SAID THE GAME WAS NNNNNOOOOOTTTTTT READY FOR RELEASE!!!<br><br>f)Ok. This is the clencher. Comparing the purchase of automobiles to the price of a game is a fantasy leap, for sure. But in all fairness, some of us (techies, nerds, etc. etc.) value our pc time as much as we would if we had kids and were to spend our time with them. Therefore, this is just as important to us. YES, we all want the game to work, and are willing to help FUNCOM out in the process; but why charge us for helping them solve the problems that they are putting us through in a game that shouldn't have gone gold for A MONTH at least!!!???<br><br>Thanks <br><br>Konami <br>"What is the riddle of steel, boy..."<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've had just about every problem with this game that everyone else is having.  I've also seen some dramatic improvements just since last week.  However, I did make some choices about what I was going to do that affected my performance.<br><br>Once I get logged in, which is still tricky as hell sometimes, I get as far from a city (especially Newland, Athen, Tir, Omni, etc.) as possible.  The reason is there are too many people there and the game is (in those places) unplayable.  Once out in the world I find a remote outpost with bank, mission, insurance and reclaim terminals and use that as my base.  I'd tell you all where some of them are, but for now I like my privacy.  ;)<br><br>Once in these remote areas I have no problems with frame rate and only rare problems with lag, crashes and no problems with frame rate.  Also, the money and reward items tend to be  better since you have to go a litte farther for your missions.<br><br>As for the missions not working, I only saw that for non-assassination missions *within* city limits.  In Borealis last night I accepted 4 missions that were for in town.  2 were assassinations, the other two were item retrieval and observation.  The assassinations ones worked fine.  The other two didn't and I heard others shouting the same results.  Then I took a couple of modification missions that took place in Stret West Bank.  Guess what?  They worked great.<br><br>As for tech support, I did send a message in last week regarding graphics display and login issues I was having.  I got a replay 3 days later asking if I was still having the problem.  I responded that I had corrected those problems but listed a whole lot of others I was having in detail.  The next day I got back a response asking me to send them a copy of a file from my AO directory which details all your system specs.  I sent them the file and am just waiting for the next response.  To me that shows me that they are listening and trying to follow up which goes a long way in my book.  I'm guessing that part of the reason I may be getting better response than some is that I took the time to calmly detail my symptoms, what I had tried so far to fix them and then *asked* them for help.  <br><br>Having worked tech support for a few years I can tell you that if you yell, scream and threaten the support folks you're shooting yourself in the foot.  They'll just tune you right out and move on to the next person.  Sure, you paid for the game and want it to work.  Guess what, they want it to work too.  If it works, people will keep playing, they keep making money and they can make more money by being able to reduce the number of support staff they need.<br><br>And to all those who compare buying a $50.00 computer game to purchasing a new car or other high ticket item, give it a rest.  There is no comparison.  You buy a car and you expect it to transport you and your loved ones safely and reliably around town and that's a justified expectation.  That's why they have warranties.  You spend $50.00 on a game to relax and have fun (hopefully).  Your personal safety and that of those around you are not at stake (unless you're homocidally psychotic to begin with) like it is with a car.  That means the developers don't have to spend billions (which, except for MicroSloth, they don't have) on testing every component for many years before they can even think about releasing it to the market.<br><br>If the game doesn't work to your satisfaction you have a couple of options...<br><br>1.  Quit the game and try to get your money back for the purchase price.  Depending on where you bought it, you might have little or no trouble doing this.<br><br>2.  Be patient and wait for them to work the problems out.  If they don't, you can still quit.<br><br>3.  Fly into a apoplectic fit because you can't play with the whizbang new toy you got and blame and threaten everyone in the world over it due to your psychological shortcomings.<br><br>That's about it.  Flame on.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I think we are all huge suckers, paying $45-$50 to be beta testers.  This game is not even close to being a final product.  That is evidenced by the fact that less than 2 weeks after it's official release (which was version 11.0), FunCom has already released a new master version (12.1) to print new CDs.  So, their initial commercial release lasted all of about 10 days.  We're not talking bout bug patches here folks, we're talking major client revisions.  Imagine getting Win98, and a week and half later Win98SE is released.<br><br>Connectivity and lag issues are bound to be a problem upon launch of such a product, it's simply too difficult to truly test for and estimate system response with 30,000 people logging on (or trying to).  So, I would give FunCom the benefit of the doubt on this.  However, too many other things are simply not working in the game.  That is inexcusable, and is a result of releasing this game prematurely.<br><br>ATI/S3 vid cards are not even supported as of yet.  I don't have an ATI myself, but come on.  How could you develop a game and go through sufficient beta testing without realizing such a popular video card is not supported?  You can't, not with SUFFICIENT beta testing.  It's clear to me that they did not do sufficient beta testing.  GeForce2 & 3 cards are only supported with one driver version, none older OR newer than the one they did testing with.  I have an Oxygen VX1 32mb AGP vid card, and probably will never see support for that.  You think I'm gonna go out and buy a GeForce2 GTS for $140 to replace a comparable board to play this game? Not a chance.<br><br>I would have cancelled my account already, but I can't login to my account at the FunCom website to modify my account details.  Go figure...just one more thing they can't get right.  Oh, and try checking the bulletin boards at anarchy-online.com to try and find solutions for the inevitable problems you will face.  Yet one more thing they can't get right, can't access them half of the time (and in-game style lag when you can).<br><br>I'm just glad I didn't cancel my EQ account yet.  I'm going to try to return my copy of AO to either the store I bought it from or to FunCom directly.  I want a refund, I don't want to support them, not even several months from now when the product may be decent.  They said the free month wouldn't start until the game was 110%, evidently it's there now.  And, if this is 110%, FunCom can kiss my ass.<br><br>anarkyTEKT<br>anarkytekt@kmfms.com<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Bah.  Listen.  How can you call a game playable ONCE you get out of the city?  How ... pray tell... do you get out of the city when you can't even move due to lag?  And how can you call a game "playable" when you claim you don't get lage between 2:30 and 5:30am?  What about players having lives... and doing frivolous things like sleeping?  And it is outrageous to point your fingers at the players for not optimizing their systems properly to play this game.  The problem, my friend, is not with the players.  We purchased a game and read the box for system requirements.. and the vast majority of us are sophisticated enough to modify our systems to bare bones graphics, etc, to attempt to reduce lag.<br><br>To attempt to argue otherwise and tell us to "relax" is simply ridiculous.  I am quite relaxed and in full capacity of my senses.. thank you.  And as far as having sympathy for the workers at Funcom... I have lots of sympathy for them as human beings, but that DOES NOT change the fact that this game was released FAR TOO EARLY in order to attempt to make a profit.  Those workers are not victims of the MMORPG community, they are victims of a greedy and poorly run business which goes by the name of Funcom.  The MMORPG communtiy is justifiably extremely angry over paying $49.99 for a game which does not meet anyone's reasonable definition of "playable".  Period.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>AO is playable.  Maybe not perfectly or without bugs, but it's playable.  Part of the lag problem is that nobody wants to leave the towns.  Let me tell you, you get out of the towns and the game gets VERY smooth compared to trying to run through a zone with 300+ people in it.<br><br>As for the EQ reference, I think it is very relevent.  You can't "learn from our mistakes" when your doing something very differently.  Also, keep in mind what a zone in EQ gets like when you pack as many people into it as possible.  I've seen zones crash during GM events due to the numbers that show up.  SUre, EQ's release was two years ago (not three--I've played since release), but that doesn't change the fact that they had their problems too.<br><br>On the credit to Funcom, they appear to be working as hard as they can.  The game has improved vastly since release, but keep in mind these people are human, they make mistakes, and they like to go home at the end of the day to do those ridiculously frivolous things such as eat, sleep, bathe, and say hello to the wife and kids. (/sarcasm there at the end, sorry).<br><br>I've noticed a lot of the people having problems haven't exactly done anything to optimize performance on their end either.  At least three people I know IRL out of the 5 I know that play were trying to use the most cranked up settings they could.  naturally this will degrade performance in ANY game if the hardware can't handle it.  Many I've talked to online have yet to attempt to optimize their systems as well, or at least adjust their settings for better performance.<br><br>I do think that the "one dimension" thing can lead to problems, but it's a wonderful idea.  Perhaps once they get the hardware they need it would work, or were the internet and communication technology perfect it would be better.  At either rate, connectivity alone has improved greatly, and I'm sure it will in the future.<br><br>Funcom has not been rude or said "we want you to play this way because that is our Vision" or anything like that.  They've responded quickly as possible (YOU try to respond to over 35,000 people in a day, let alone 6) to complaints/questions.  They've been working on the stability of the game and I'm more than sure they are picking up more and more hardware to try and compensate for the problems we are having right now.<br><br>As I tell anyone with any new game, MMORPG or just online or simply play at home, give it time.  It's not just this company that releases games with glitches: it's the game developement community as a whole.  They all do it.  I have not bought a single game that didn't need patched and bugs worked out.  Sure, game developement companies should release a perfect product, complete from the time it hits the shelves, but in todays competitive market, deadlines can make or break the company/game.  Same goes in any industry these days.  Hell, I can't count the number of vehicle recalls I've gotten in the mail after buying my Ford Focus...<br><br>So have some patience and understanding.  It will be fixed, and it will rock.<br><br>NytCrie<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Nytcrie,<br><br>Personally, I've tried to downgrade the visual and graphics settings, and have still had problems.  This is true whether or not I've been in a city.  I've had the "tell your character to sit down and have it sit down 3 minutes later problem" in the city, in the countryside, in mission zones, and in shops.  Also, I have a Pentium 3 1 GHz system with 256 mb ram and an Nvidia GeForce 2 MX-400 video card with 64 mb ram.  If that is not sufficient to run the game at top end or near top end setting without difficulties, then Funcom has a serious design problem.  Also, I spent 10 minutes last night "trapped" inside a store in Tir becuase I could not zone out to the city.  I've also been unable to zone out of the city into the country side.  In both cases I got the all to familiar "playfield shift failed message".  Clearly, Funcom still has huge problems.  Perhaps, as some have said, they clearly underestimated the number of people they would have trying to log on.  Also, considering that this is a new game, most people have to stay in the cities as that is the newbie zone for new players.  Clearly, Funcom has a great game here, but one that can not adequately support the number of people who are trying to play.  And to answer the main question of this forum.  Is Anarchy Online playable??  If someone with a Pentium 3 1 GHz system with 256 mb ram and an nVidia GeForce 2 MX-400 video card with 64 mb ram attempts to play using a 100Mbps network connection at work (at a time when everyone else has already gone home) gets stuck in a store becuase the game won't let him out of the store.. .well, I think that answers the question.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

And the oh so sincere apologies ... and earnest gratitude for our patience....<br><br>The fact is  ---  Just try and log on and play and you will have your answer.  This game is simply not playable.  Yes, I would try to fool myself into thinking that it is, because I would like it to be as much as anyone.  But I am not so lost in fantasy as to ignore the simple fact that my ping is soooo red that I can't even move the majority of the time, I get dropped constantly, and there are pathing issues which make EQ look sophisticated.<br><br>This is simply a business trying to make money and launching a product before it is ready in order to make profit.  This game is simply a rip-off.  I have already cancelled my subscription.  If they manage to survive what should be an inevitable backlash from legitimately dissatisfied customers... and still eventually make a playable product ( at least several months off, imho ), I will consider putting to get my $49.99 (so far wasted) investment to use.<br><br>And to those who say that this game is the wave of the future.... I say -- you have a pathetic view of the future if you support a company that releases such a poor product.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There are still a few major issues that need to be worked out before I would deem the game 'playable'.  All today there were giant issues (not only with lag towards zoning) but with the playfield connections, so when I wasn't dying of lag, I couldn't zone anyways.  Before that though, when I did manage to get in a few missions or so, it lags out so badly in combat that when the connection finally comes back, I simply die.  Now I don't feel a real need to use the insurance machines too often, seeing as I can kick the crap out of 2, maybe even 3 of the guys I'm fighting at level 7 (easy slider comes in handy there)  So when I lag out, and just die - when I know that if I were actually at the controls I'd be able to do something to fix the combat from going to hell, it really ticks me off.  In my opinion, that's far from playable.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
