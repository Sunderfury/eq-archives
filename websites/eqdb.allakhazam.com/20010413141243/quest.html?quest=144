This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest. The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it out.  When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.  He tells you to go talk to his sister Nolusia who is in the Erudin Palace.  Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.  When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.  Her brother is at Crows  (It seems he is sick and is in need of some Erud's Tonic.  This is a side quest).<br><br>Go to Qeynos and talk to him. Ask him about Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear, and he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dyllin Starshine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport).  Beware that any smugglers around him will come to his aid.  Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard, +Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers)  The faction hits for him are pretty large, so be aware after that of potentially slipping to KOS in Qeynos.<br><br>After going back to Qeynos, go back to Moodoro and say I want page 34.   He says ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I get it because the work is fiction anyway.  He then offers to play a game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a jester he will give you the page.  Along with the jester, you might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight.   [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward].  Once the whole thing is combined you get the Testament of Vanear, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop lore item.  You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum.<br><br>NOTE:  I am told that you can avoid Erudin completely by giving Moodoro Finharn 2gp (the same guy that you get page 34 from) and he gives you the 2-slot book of the testament of Vanear.  Once you get the book, you can combine the page you get from Moodoro (by playing his card game) and the other page from Dylin in HighHold Pass and you've got the book!  No need to go to Erudia.  And because Moodoro sometimes hangs out at one of the sewer entrances, evil races could sneak in and get the book, too. )</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I FINALLY got this guy the other night!  Hardest part was getting my spot in line as this is one of the most heavily camped spawns I've seen yet.  At lvl 20 all smugglers were green to me except one that was blue and one red guy.  These both wander, but as you camp there it won't take long to figure out their marching pattern. Druids, wait till the red guy turns the bend toward the water, cast harmony on the other wandering smuggler if he's close and he won't lay a hand on you as you pound Dyllin with every dot, dd and root/snare you have. Took all of twenty seconds to kill him..didn't get hit once.  If this helps, my kill was on Sunday night at about 1230am...as this is a rare 6-8 hour spawn this timing info woulda been helpful for me if I had it. As it was it took three weeks of trying, but it was worth it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Choriocapillaris Bentlash<br>Humble 20th circle<br>Halfling Druid<br>Xev <br>When in doubt, throw tracers<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Completed this quest last night, well worth the effort .... +10Wis is really expensive on any other item.<br><br>For those of you that have read about how difficult this is below, here are a few pointers<br><br>1. Do the short version of the quest by collecting the book and 1st page in Queynos.<br>2. I recommend not sitting and camping Dyllin for hours and hours. Play another character and check in on the dyllin camp every hour or so.<br>3. I was a 25 dru and killing him is easy if you are not rushed. wait for him to do his walk. He walks down to where you come out of the water to get to him in this area. Look around, make sure no reds are close. Snare, 4 careless lightnings and minimal melee will do it.<br>4. combine and enjoy .... havent addressed the Queynos faction hit yet.<br><br>no matter what else you read, do this quest. easiest quest for biggest gain there is .... in fact if you are lucky, u could do it in 15-20 min if dyllins out.<br><br>Thats about it ........ good luck!<br><br><br>Grawl Darkdawn<br>25th Dru<br>7th Hammer<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As a half elf druid the extra wisdom and mana provided by the ToV comes in handy.  This morning I finished the quest.  A couple of days ago I went to Qeynos and talked to the Erudite who stands out infront of Crow's Pub.  He gave me the book for 2gp, and then after spending over 100gp in 4gp increments he finally gave me the Jester Card.  I returned the Jester and recieved page 34 - easy.  I spent 3 days camping Dyllin off and on in High Keep.  Finally this morning when I woke up I checked to see if he was there.  He was.  There was a red smuggler walking back and forth, keeping the same path right in front of Dyllin.  I knew that if I attacked Dyllin I would be killed by the smuggler.  So, I bound myself to be on the safe side.  Sure enough, I attacked and I died.  However, when I returned to my bind point, the smuggler had moved on and Dyllin was still there.  I memorized Careless Lightning and Dizzying Wind quickly, and nuked him to death.  30 seconds later I hade page 30 and ported out of there before the smuggler could come back.  In the safe surroundings of the North Karana druid rings I put page 30 & 34 into the book and hit "combine".  VIOLA!  I now had my very own ToV =)  Just a tip:  I am of 19th season, and to me there was only 1 red smuggler.  This smuggler is lvl 50+ so be careful.  If you can, wait until the smuggler walks back toward the water and out of sight.  Once out of sight the smuggler will be gone for about a minute and a half before he heads toward Dyllin again.  I never got this opportunity because when I arrived the smuggler was caught in a new pattern walking back and forth in front of Dyllin.  Either way, make sure you are bound close by so that you can finish the job if you die.<br><br>~Anlah<br>19th Season Druid<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I camped Dylin last night for a few hours, never showed, gave up, went to bed.  Decided what the heck, first thing in the morning before I head out to work, I log in, Dylin is there, place is empty of players.  I wait a while for the red to me smuggler to move away, Dylin starts wandering.  He first goes into the cave with the rogues, then wanders all the way down the passage to the water.  The red smuggler just left the tunnel, I figure what the heck, root Dylin, spirit strike him a few times, root wears off, I melee him.  I was facing the water at the time, and when Dylin's health got low, he ran to the water, before I could root him again.  He comes back to whack on me some more, I manage to root him, and kill him.  No smugglers ever intervened, piece of cake.  Loot page 34, and the sealed letter while I'm at it.  Spent a total of 5 minutes from connecting to shutting down my computer.  Now I just have to get my faction high enough to go to Qeynos and finish the quest.  I wasn't planning on doing this quest at this time, just was in Highhold with friends, and decided to give it a try.  Good luck to anyone else trying, I would recommend waiting for Dylin to move, it was very easy when he was alone by the water.  Oh, and he conned blue to me at 21.<br><br>Graeme, Barbarian Shaman of 21 seasons, Erollisi Marr<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>While I was camping the place, I spent a lot of time watching the Red smuggler, he has a very regular routine.  I would highly recomend watching him.  He goes up to the exit that has the drop for a while, then wanders back down to stand near the area where Dyllin spawns, then he wanders down the entrance passage to the water.  He stays in that passage for a total of about 2 minutes.  There is also a wandering blue to me smuggler that follows approximately the same route, about 30 seconds behind the red one.  Dyllin also wanders, he goes into the cave with the rogues, and down to the water.  I personally found that waiting for him to go to the water, and killing him there was trivial.  It was far enough that no smugglers aggroed, and I had watched to see that the red smuggler had just wandered out of the passage, so I knew I had some time before he came back.  The important thing here is, watch for the patterns, so that you can pick the best time and place for you to take him down.<br><br>Graeme, Barbarian Shaman of 21 seasons, Erollisi Marr<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I killed Dyllin Starshine tonight. There were 2 other players there before me. I can't remember names but they both conned green to me (lv 36 shaman). I decided to get the testament because it would be a nice quest that i could do without too many problems. I sat in the open spot just up the ramp from where i swam in. Sitting near the tree looking across at the stove near the wall. I sat there for a little while and decided to play my monk for a while. I checked back off and on for the next 2 days. Seeing campers here and there all looking for him. Day 3 I logged on and started talking to 2 players who had been there for some time. Well we started talking about all the ksing that this Dylline Starshine has brought to highpass. I proceded to tell them that is wasn't my style to ks and if he popped i'd take my spot in line for him. Well as luck would have he popped and I said aloud "pop" for the person who was to go first. He attacked straight forward and was soon consumed by a nearby smuggler who conned red, even to me. I then told the next guy to go get him if he wants him...he lasted just about as long as the first guy, and was killed by the same red smuggler. It was my turn...I looked around and saw that the smuggler that had killed the other 2 had walked some distance away. Seeing that the coast was clear I hit him once with Winter's roar and he went down...one blow. I started to loot him and got the page and also a Bayle's List 3 which is for another quest, and noticed that the smuggler had returned and aggroed on me.. Having thought of this before hand I had my gate loaded and just gated back to safty. I feel sorry for the 2 that died but when it comes to a spawn like this.....it's every man for himself.....sorry guys :(<br><br>Just my experience, off to finish this quest.<br><br>Good Luck and Safe Paths :)<br><br>Synnzamarr Mezzimorr<br>barbarian shaman of the 36 season <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Read some of these messages on this quest, and considering the great prize, tried it out myself.  Pretty much followed the post of "Quick method..." It was about 6am and when i went into highhold pass it was just me there!  When I got to the spawn spot, he was there and conned blue to me at lvl 19.  There were two distinct types of smugglers in there too. "s smuggler" was red to me, so probably the high level mob the other posts were refering to. "a smuggler" was white to me.  Just sat against wall opposite him (camo'd of course) and waited till the smugglers made their way away from him.  Rooted him, dot, dd a few times, then an "a smuggler" started smackin me and he risisted my root spell, good thing though cause i was going to move away from him if it had stuck, and right then an "s smuggler" walked in between me and Dyllin, but didn't do a thing!! just walked past like nothin was happening.  So I quick ran over to my man, who was almost dead from my initial attack, all the while the other "a smuggler" was hitting me, and killed him with a few blows.  Looted the page (something else dropped too, but I was not interested right then) ran to where i came in through the water, luckily not running into any real bad characters, and swam to safety.  It seemed either these guys dont swim, or are terrible swimmers, because when I got to the other side I had plenty of time to med for mana for a gate out of there.  The rest of the quest is pretty easy enough (I got lucky and pulled the jester card on first try!) just read the other posts for more info.  That's it.  Traveling was the hardest part for me in this quest, but I think I was a little lucky too.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A month or so after hearing if the Testament of Verean I have one in my hand. My first attempt reaulted in a my very untimely demise. This last Saturday saw success though as fortune was with me. A guildmate and I went to check on Dylin at 3:30am saturday morning, as that is when I had seen him previously and die at the hands of his friend. Well at 7:00am I returned, my friend was the wiser as he was fast asleep. Well no Dylin. So is do a shout to see if anyone had seen/killed Dylin resently. A 54lvl warrior responds that he had killed Dylin and died at the hands of Dylin's friend at 7:00am the previous day. Ol well 24 hours Dylin was last seen so when would he next spawn. No up comes a, then, 34lvl Shaman, who politely ask if I'm camping Dylan. "Well yes, I guess I respond", though if Dylin shows up I'm not sure what I'll do. I then tell him that Dylin's friends are tough. "Ol dont worry they all con green to me", famous last words. So I start calling out to any guildmate, that is foolish enough to be on at 7:00am on a Saturday morning. Only one responds and we chat while I wait for Dylan and he waits to go into Sol B. "Well I'm sorry I cant help you I'm waiting for so and so to go......", so we chat and both wait. And who shows up but Dylin, in all his glory. The shaman ask me if I'm going to take Dylan, to which I say wait a sec please. One last heart flet beseach to my guildmate outside Sol B, but the distance is to far for him to make it in a timely manor. So I tell the shaman "Yeah go ahead and I'll see how you do it and get the page, or I'll get to loot the Dylin if you die." So spells start flying and Dylin is rooted and then the melee start, well 5 sec into it another smuggler runs up and starts beating on the shaman. The shaman take this for about 3 secs and then runs off. Well Dylin is there rooted and I stand staring for about 5 sec. Shaman doesnt return so four Careless Lightings and an ignite later Dylin is dead. I send a tell to the shaman are you dead or just running away. No reply, so I loot the body get page 30, and some other letter. Now what, had ring of commons memed, just in case, check my mana lvl it will be close. Five sec later Im in WC with the page. I send another tell to the shaman, well I'm polite, asking if he is okay. "This is B@#$S#$t" comes the reply. Ol'no did I KS this guy I though. "What happened?" I reply back. "He tells me he died in the water at the had of Dylin's friend that then conned red to him and had hit him for 175 pt a whack. He then ask me what happened after he ran. So I tell him Dylin is dead and I unfortunately have the page. Well he is in Iceclad, naked, and on his way back to get his corpse. <br><br>So here I sit with book in hand counting myself the most fortunate hobbit in the land. <br><br>The shaman went back and did get his page the next morning as well as revenge upon poor Dylin, but not his red friend. <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As a level 18 High Elf Cleric, I had made my way up to High Hold Pass to spend a few levels camping Knolls and Orcs.  I also had intentions of taking out Dyllin Starshine for the Library Book Quest, and was prepared to spend vast amounts of time camping him.<br><br>Just moments after logging in (my second day there), my Wood Elf Druid travel partner excitedly asks me, &#8220;What was the name of the NPC your after?&#8221; <br><br>&#8220;Dyllin Starshine,&#8221; I replied.<br><br>&#8220;He&#8217;s here,&#8221; my excitable Druid friend responded back, &#8220;I&#8217;m tracking him right now!&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Well surely Dyllin is being camped,&#8221; I thought to myself, but it would be fun to check it out anyway, talk with whoever is camping him for advice, and maybe get the spawn interval (to figure out his next spawn time).<br><br>So we invised ourselves and made our way to the hidden smugglers camp. I was going to strategize for his next spawn. I made plans to stake out the area, and prepare escape paths for when our turn at camping Dyllin came up. I was going to record who the other smugglers were, their patterns of roaming, levels, etc.<br><br>We popped up on the small landing after swimming through the underwater tunnel, and who should walk down to meet us (alone), but Dyllin Starshine himself. With no other smuggler in sight, Dyllin was an easy kill, too easy.  We swam out the way we came. No elaborate escape plans. No smugglers chasing us. No camping. No waiting my turn to camp him. I couldn&#8217;t believe it!<br><br>We immediately canceled our dates with the Gnolls and Orcs, and headed to Qeynos to find Moodor Finharn. I had no faction problems with any NPC&#8217;s in Qeynos. I completed the Quest, and am now the proud owner of the Testament of Vanear!<br><br>This was an incredibly easy Quest for the WIS+10 MANA+10 item. Incredibly easy!<br><br>Boruo<br>Priest of Solidarity<br>18th Season<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, after camping Dyllin for over 5 hours I finally finished this quest. Dyllin was green to me at lvl 24. And easily dispatched him without any trouble. I guess not having hunted here before with my druid was a good idea, as I was not mobed by them (they coned amiable). This quest was one of the easiest for the quality of the reward I recieved. I suggest all classes who can use this Item do this quest.<br><br><br>Falren Thorongil 25th Druid<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
