By: Anonymous <br>Posted @ Thu, Jul 12th 1:01 PM Score: Default[2.00] <br>While I am aware that console games are different in that they don't support MMORPG style games (yet) I would suggest that the same standards should be upheld for PC based games. Just because you "can" send out patches doesn't make it right. If I bought this game for a console I'd be demanding my money back. Why? Because right now it is unplayable and full of bugs (seriously, how can something shoot and kick me from across a football field). Of course, eventually the bugs will be worked out and this will be an excellent game but that doesn't justify releasing an unfinished, beta-quality product. If this were a console game, FunCom would be out of business. Until it could be released as a console game I don't think it should be considered a "finished" product.<br> <br> <br>  [Top] <br><br> Riddle of Steel?

By: Anonymous <br>Posted @ Thu, Jul 12th 9:38 AM Score: Default[2.00] <br>Samsheed, <br>No offense friend but I don't share your enthusiasm, and that may very well be because you started playing EQ early on and have been brain washed that these things happen. But you know what I'm not buying it. When a game is produced it should be playable from day one. When I go to the store and drop $70 for a game then sign away a subscription for $15 a month or more I expect at the very least that the darn thing works properly. Anyone who tried playing in week one knows first hand how annoying that was, and although admittedly Funcom was fast and furious about improving game performance I am still not satisfied. You are right that I could end my subscription, but everyone knows that I will never see my $70 again. I feel disapointed that the game doesn't work well and feel like I was robbed of my initial investment. Overall the experience was unpleasant. If Funcom wants to take a financial bullet for it's subscribers, it may help them more financially in the end with customer satisfaction paying back in spades. If Funcom could not produce a playable game, then they never should have released it in the first place. If they ran out of money to finish it properly, that is their mistake. Why should we the players and subscribers have to pay with our money and time for their inability to forsee the problems, that is their problem and their product and we are their customers who deserve satisfaction. <br><br>IMO <br>Sparrow <br><br> <br> <br>  [Top] <br><br> I must just be lucky then. By: Samsheed<br>11 posts <br>Posted @ Thu, Jul 12th 6:56 AM Score: Good[4.33] <br>I must just be lucky or something. Or maybe my standards for what makes a game "playable" are a little different than others, I dunno. <br><br>My background: Been running around EQ since barely a month after its launch, gone through heck and back with connection problems, but on the whole, nothing world-shaking. Started with AO on July 4th. My EQ time is generally every night during the week, and most weekends. I only get into AO about every other weekend, but then I play about 8am-3pm Eastern. <br><br>So far, I've had a pretty good experience with the game. I know that no product like this is going to be perfect "out of the box," so I do my best to be patient instead of going ballistic whenever it gets flaky. I'll admit, logging in on the 4th of July, creating my character, and then as soon as I enter the training grounds getting "The servers are coming down now, please log out," did kind of irk me, especially since that day I only had about an hour and a half to play and really wanted to try AO out (didn't get into beta quick enough). The patch time? 2 hours, natch. *shrug* Oh well, more time to study the manual better and learn more of the basic controls. <br><br>Got back in that Saturday, and had a pretty good time. There were moments when lag got kinda rough, but I took advantage of it-- went over more of the in-game controls, read up and tested some of the emote animations (I don't know which made me laugh more, /disco or /moon *grin*), and generally fiddled around with settings. I think it went pretty well-- learning everything from scratch, no gifts from any more advanced players, but I made level 6 in about 5 hours of play and only died once. "Never enter a mission with only 24 bullets left if your only weapon is a slug-thrower, Sammy," I could hear the old men saying when I was reanimated. <br><br>There was ONE place where I had trouble with frame/lag that became irritating, and that was when I explored the main part of town looking for a Nano shop. I got to close to what must have been the local "bazaar" because my FR went from smoothness to about 5 seconds per frame (no, I DIDN'T reverse that, I was moving in 5-second jerks by my screen). Once I eventually stabilized back in the direction I had come from, I RAN away and didn't go back. <br><br>Overall, though, I have had a pretty good experience with the game. Could it have gone better? Sure, but you can test something like this to death and STILL not get everything ironed out until sometime AFTER it's released, simply because there's no substitute for trying it out for real. The players after release can put in more man-hours in a single day than their whole company PLUS the beta testers could do in probably a week or more. Wider range of system configurations, playing styles, thought processes that lead players to try different things in different ways (which is how most "exploit" bugs are found-- if the testers found 'em first, they'd have been corrected ahead of time, unless the tester who found it was unscrupulous enough to hide the fact from everyone, hoping for an advantage after release *shrug*), and just sheer numbers stressing the systems-- all stuff that's essentially impossible to duplicate in the closed environment of a beta test. <br><br>As for saying they should keep us in for free until they "get all the bugs out," how then do they make the money they need to recover their initial investment in developing the game AND the additional funds needed to keep things going AND pay their programmers, support staff, internal testers, etc. if they DON'T start the paid periods? Bandwith and servers don't grow on trees, don't fall from the sky, and aren't left under the developer's pillows in exchange for teeth by some mythical fairy of MMORPG. They've gotta be paid for, and the cash has to come from SOMEWHERE. Of course, they COULD keep it free and keep going deeper and deeper into debt until they had the bugs worked out to everyone's satisfaction. Then they'd just have to scale up their charge to recoup the losses at that point. <br><br>Am I the only one who'd rather go ahead and pay $12.95 now instead of having to pay $30, $50, $100 a month a while down the road? <br><br>Hey, if you're REALLY that put out by it all and don't want to pay for something "unplayable" (no, I'm not going to say "take it back"), close your account for a month or three, then come back and try again. Why beat your brains out day after day trying to play if you feel it's unplayable? Give 'em time to fix things up, and THEN try again. Save yourself a whole lot of headaches and frustrations in the meantime. <br><br>Think. Then think some more. Then, if all questions are answered, consider how to act. <br><br>Samsheed<br> <br>Samsheed/MNK, Mahein/ENC, Memvarwen/BRD, Hisstesh/SHM, Sinestraln/SK, Tresk/ROG, From Rodcet Nife <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I have no trouble with fantasy games using hitpoints, when it comes to the use of guns however everthing changes.  I have just seen a little of D20's Star Wars and their concept of fatigue and physical hit points sounds good.  This might be hard to do for a hack and slash game, but think of the challenge!  The quote on the opening page of this web site says it all for me, how can a man with a bat beat someone with a sub machine gun?  Sometimes I'm sure, but it should not be totally dependant on skill level<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

It's a good game, and all my posts on this board tell the truth, but I DONT THINK we all should be paying starting a few days ago (A 'Free' month is actually included in the purchase price of the game...) and I know FUNCOM is kicking themselves in the leg right now. So, how do we help them out? <br><br>I'm very mixed up on this right now, for one. I just don't really have the time to get screwed over day in and day out trying to log on to an unplayable game. I have a life outside of it thats much more interesting, so I'm o.k. there. But I'm an adult... What about the kids who are out of school for summer and bought this game with their 55 dollars of lawn mowing money hoping to have a good time with it? That's who I feel sorry for. Them and FUNCOM. <br><br>I wonder if FUNCOM will step up to the plate and re-neg on their decision to start the free month almost a week ago now. I hope so, but most likely not. They are almost a real life Omni Tek for sure.  :(<br><br>Konami Ballbuster<br>R.S.G.E.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here's a message I sent to AO Tech Support & Marketing, and though I'm listing it here, it is NOT meant to bash the developers of this game:<br><br>Subject: Apartment Bug; Hotkey Issue; Action Window Issue; First Free Month... <br>To: support@anarchy-online.com <br>CC: marketing@funcom.com <br>         <br> <br><br><br>To Support:<br><br>1. Apartment Bug: Cannot access apartment. Have key in<br>inventory, but zoning sequence will not initiate.<br><br>2. Hotkey: I cannot find any information in the box<br>manual or on AO community sites regarding how to<br>Hotkey<br>commands, such as for my Opifex Agent. I want to be<br>able to access in the Action Screen a button for the<br>use of Martial Arts in combat mode. I currently have<br>Fire, Aimed Shot, Brawl, Riposte, Dimach, and the<br>other basic commands. I've been maxing-out Martial<br>Arts<br>with IP's because several player forums have suggested<br>that Martial Arts should be the primary form of hand<br>to hand combat. Question: Is the Brawl Button what I<br>would use to initiate Martial Arts in combat? When I<br>click Brawl, my Agent begins punching the oponent but<br>no use of kicks, while my NPC oponent has full use of<br>kicking and punching. So, specifically, how do I<br>Hotkey<br>Martial Arts into my Action Window or onto the<br>keyboard?<br><br>3. Action Window:  Since my first day of gameplay<br>buttons in my Action Window have been randomly<br>disappearing and reappearing. Now I understand that<br>when I equip a weapon or item the icon for it will<br>appear in the Action Screen, but WHY after stacking<br>certain buttons does my predefined sequence go into<br>disaray? <br><br>4. Free Month: Obviously it's expected that an MMORPG<br>in it's infancy stages is going to have bugs and<br>performance issues. I'm 38 years old and am an avid<br>MMORPG'er, so I understand that the best way to test a<br>game for bugs & performance issues is to have<br>thousands<br>of players filling the servers.  But, one day after I<br>registered it was announced that AO's first free month<br>would go into effect because the developers felt that<br>the game was now playable. Yes, it is true that I can<br>roam the Omni-Tek Training Ground and engage in<br>combat.<br>I was able to go from level 1 to 5 in two days, and<br>have raised my skill points adaquately and have<br>accumulated over a thousand credits. But, that's about<br>it. Though I was able to accomplish an easy mission in<br>Highrise 12, when I attempted to zone out of the<br>newbie area and into the big city of Omni-1, I was<br>plagued with extremely-slow framerates, zoning crashes<br>to my desktop, impossible to implement nano programs,<br>extremely-slow implementation of action buttons to the<br>point that the game would become completely<br>unplayable.<br>I had to go back to the newbie zone because outside of<br>the newbie zone was ABSOLUTELY-UNPLAYABLE! NOTHING<br>FUNCTIONS AT ALL OUTSIDE OF THE NEWBIE ZONE! So, with<br>that said, I do NOT believe that Funcom should be<br>implementing the Free Month at this stage in the games<br>development! This is NOT fair to the AO gaming<br>community, since you are very simply using us as<br>PAYING<br>GUNEA PIGS to BETA-TEST YOUR UNFINISHED GAME.  I'm<br>stating FOR THE RECORD that if performance outside of<br>the newbie zone continues to be unmanageble for the<br>next 3 weeks, then I will have NO CHOICE in regard to<br>cancelling my subscription until I read a CREDIBLE AO<br>REVIEW at a Review Site such as GAMESPOT.COM stating<br>that AO is playable/definitely worth paying a monthly<br>subscription rate for. How you could POSSIBLY consider<br>AO playable at this stage so soon after LAUNCH is<br>something of an EXTREME mystery to me. But, I suppose<br>that is the nature of MMORPG's these days. Online<br>gaming is still in it's infancy stages and I would<br>expect that within the next couple of years<br>development companies will start to realize that<br>releasing unfinished buggy games will NOT attract<br>positive sentiment from the gaming community,<br>especially when we have to pay for the privelege of<br>BETA-TESTING your games :) Nothing personal friends.<br>This is just my opinion. Aside from the performance<br>issues and my disinterest in paying past the free<br>month<br>for an obviously unplayable game at this early stage,<br>the graphics are very nice considering TLJ engine you<br>implemented, and being an avid Adventure/Roleplayer<br>it's not difficult to see that AO has GREAT POTENTIAL<br>to be an outstanding game. <br><br>              Thanks for your time. I will be eagerly<br>awaiting your response :)<br><br>My PC Tech Specs: PIII/500MHz - 128 RAM - nVidia<br>TNT(version 1)graphics card - SoundBlaster X-Gamer - I<br>defrag my Hard Drive and run RAM<br>Recovery(MemTurboII)tool to recover up to 45M of RAM<br>before login to servers. I do not run (MemTurbo)<br>during gameplay. After attempting to zone outside of<br>the newbie area into Omni-1 I was forced to go back to<br>newbie area, log-out, and when I ran (MemTurbo to<br>recover up to 45M,<br>I was able to recover 95M...which further suggests to<br>me that there is DEFINITELY RAM LEAKAGE in-game. <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

But after playing AO for a week,<br>the sound quality has diminished greatly. Now it sounds as though my soundcard has been dragged across granite, torched, doused in acid, and sun-dried. Perhaps it's time for an upgrade. But I'd hate to think that my computer needs to be upgraded because AO fried the syetem.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I tried to Log-In to the Account page, not specifically to cancel just yet, but to see what procedure was involved in cancelling the account.<br>Every effort I made to Log-In was immediately thwarted with a "Log-In Error!" message stating that my Username and Password were unacceptable. Yet, with the same Username and Password I was able to Log-In to the servers on countless occasions, including immediatly before and after attempting to Log-In to the Account page. Interpret this as you will. To be honest, I don't really want to cancel my account. Because when the game works, which in my case happens VERY infrequently, AO actually IS quite fun. When I called EBX in Santa Monica, a staff acquaintance who is a self-proclaimed EQ fanatic, fellow adventurer, and local EQ expert told me when I inquired about EB's policy on exchanging AO, he told me that it's considered "normal" in the MMORPG community for a game such as AO to be released with SO many bugs and performance issues.<br>He had been playing EQ since Launch Day and stated that the problems AO is having now are NOTHING compared to the issues EverQuest had the first 3 months after release. He suggested that if I truly like the game & think it has potential and am hesitant on returning it now, then I should keep it and be patient for a couple of months. He said that's about how long it took EverQuest to get to the point where it was playable. And believe me this guy is a VERY serious EQ'er. He has an impressive playing style and has made tons of EQ friends in his guilds and has developed an impressive line of characters. I currently have 16 interesting EQ characters that I was VERY much in the process of developing on Antonica, Kunark, and Velious, but have placed their development on hold for a time, while I explore Anarchy Online. I'm not entirely displeased with AO, simply because I see SO MUCH potential. Granted, the graphics are nice but could be better. And the sound could be better, considering my X-Gamer soundcard and Altec Lansing 880 speakers with subwoofer. I guess Ragnar Torquist & Tommy Strand thought that utilizing the graphics engine, from THE LONGEST JOURNEY, would allow them to incorporate a massive fantasy world with many possibilities for vehicular travel and teleportation between many huge zones, and would enable players not to have to use a High-End Gaming Rig to play this game. But, quite the contrary, what I read recently and you can take it for whatever it's worth players should be aware that you WILL need no less than a high-end system such as a P4/1.5GHz with a minimum of 256 RAM, and a Gforce card to get the game to a state where it's even playable. Don't quote me word for word on that, but from what I've experienced on my PIII/500, 128 RAM, TNT, SoundBlaster, 56K V.90 system is that AO is NOT playable now, nor does it "look" as though it will be in the near future. Things could always change, though. I'd been looking around for a new high-end system at Falcon-nw, Voodoopc...& Alienware recently and am having a 1.5M/128Kb DSL line installed in a few days, but for the time being I'm suffering through ALL the frustrations & heartache that everyone else is. So Do I return the game or keep it? Hmmm...Don't know, yet. But Electronics Boutique gave me the ultimatum: "Return it now", or as Donnie Brasco says, "FOGETTABOUT IT" :)  <br>      <br>             "Food For Thought"<br><br>      I may or may not keep this game. I'm thinking that I could return AO, go back to playing EQ, and wait until AO is playable and worth shelling out thirteen bucks a month for. Yet, on the other hand, I've already created two AO characters that are pretty cool and I'd like to create other class/professions to see the differences in playing-style. It's pretty cool having the ability to create an infinite number of characters as either Omni...Neutral...or Clan affiliate, to explore the world with. What would be REALLY cool is if instead of ending the conflict in four years, which if I'm not mistaken is the developer's plan to end the game permanently, if they did what Lucas Arts is doing with Star Wars: Galaxies by creating the ability for galactic interplanetary travel, that would be enough to keep me GLUED to this game four the next four years and endure whatever problems are going to plague AO in the coming months...& uhhhh (Years?).<br><br>    Espiria        Fazzel          Mathazar<br>    Level 6        Level 1         Level 1<br>    Opifex Agent   Atrox Enforcer  Nano Nano-Tech<br>    Omni-Tek       Neutral         Clans<br><br>                       <br>             <br>                    <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

It took me two nights of camping just to get to the other side of the city so that I could zone to another area and go explore the countryside. Granted, once you get out of the city, it's a little better, but not by very much.

Considering that AO was following in the Very Large footsteps of EQ and had the opportunity of learning from their mistakes,  I don't understand how FUNCOM could make such a HUGE marketing blunder by releasing this LAME DUCK of a game.  Though I did create a few characters, It wasn't because the game was SO good and playable.  I created all these characters with the idea that I'd be spending the next few months in the newbie arear because the game was for the most part completely unplayable outside of the newbie zone.  And though I did cancel my account and returned the game back to Electronics Boutique,  I would consider repurchasing it if the problems were for the most part solved,  and the game was playable.  I don't particularly want to lose the characters I've created and I do still believe the game has huge potential.  Unfortunately,  by the time AO IS playable,  there will be a whole slew of new games available for the Xbox and PS2 consoles along with some exciting new PC games.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I understand that there are bills to pay and publishers to worry about but the company should look upon this with shame.  Just because other MMORPG started out as badly does not mean that the consumer should not expect a quality game.  I understand that there is no such thing as a bug-free piece of software but the unending lag and disconnects that game with the first release should never have been brought to the stores.  Just because every other company does it doesnt mean that it isnt wrong to f*** the consumers.  We expected a quality game when it releases (quality as in bug-light).  The company must realize that this poor start just means a loss of revenue in the future.  I have pleaded patience to the customers that come in to the store I work in, because I  know eventually Funcom will get it right.  THIS DOESNT MEAN IT ISNT STILL F*****G THE CUSTOMER.  It was a very Bad Thing to do.  If it was delays vs. a crappy game.  Look at Blizzard, the gamers buying their products know that even though there are (massive) delays they will get a product that works (and will also kick ass but thats beside the point or maybe not).  Funcom should have learned by now that gamers dont like stuff that breaks and that they shouldnt do it anyway.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>While I am aware that console games are different in that they don't support MMORPG style games (yet) I would suggest that the same standards should be upheld for PC based games. Just because you "can" send out patches doesn't make it right. If I bought this game for a console I'd be demanding my money back. Why? Because right now it is unplayable and full of bugs (seriously, how can something shoot and kick me from across a football field). Of course, eventually the bugs will be worked out and this will be an excellent game but that doesn't justify releasing an unfinished, beta-quality product. If this were a console game, FunCom would be out of business. Until it could be released as a console game I don't think it should be considered a "finished" product.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Honestly, last night was as bad as some of my Beta 4 nights.  The lag was terrible, and at one point during a mission, I couldn't walk through a door, the whole jiggy screen lag effect.  But the Mobs could shoot me through the doors, and cast harmful programs at me as well.  I couldn't get to them, problem with being a Martial Artist.  I had to quit out, and come back in.
