	   <tr><td colspan=2>  Ok, so now I have completed this quest twice. Once, I gave the harness to the broodmother and she just became a pet to a dire wolf without ever reaching the giant fort. The wolf then attacked, and so did she, but I panic animaled it, and she stayed with it as it ran away (I ran to Thurg). So, no leggings that time.<br>   The second time I did the quest, I killed fergul, no prob, got the leggings. Then the servers malfunctioned and booted everyone as I was medding. When I finally was able to sign back on, Poof! no leggings. Also, I now had the harness back. Lovely.<br>   So keep in mind, kiddies, that the quest is bugged, and so are the leggings themselves, it seems. Oh, and yes, it did save my character when I looted, so it's not like I just lost them to a rollover update.<br>   As for whether Verant cares and will help...lol. <br>  Ulfborn, 44 ranger, Veeshan<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just finished this today. I was able to do it solo at 52. (204 wis though) <br><br>I handed in the harness of control to the broodmother. As soon as I did this, invis droped, and I got attacked by the wurms near her. This is no big deal, I just ran to the giant fort. You will outrun the wurms and they will not follow that far.  I got to the fort and sat on the left side (as you look at it) invis. A few min later (enought time for me to cast chloro and med) Broodmama showed up. Targeted FF and pulled with Starfire. Got him to follow UNSNARED past the zone to EW, following tight to the wall. On the far side of the zone path,snared, doted, immolated, ro, root and med'ed. Was down to 2m at this point. From here on out I root/dot'ed. I am not sure if I pulled him far enough away or what, but Broodmother never came to his side. I had to re-snare only once.  Best advice, pull very far from fort, then snare. Root dot if you are doing this solo. And take your time. You can't do this if you get adds, and if you zone, he WILL REPOP.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I did this quest last night and it seems that everyone seems to say "THIS IS HOW IT IS...I DID IT AND IT GOES THE SAME WAY FOR EVERYONE EVERY TIME."  I am here to say this is how it went for me when I did the quest.  <br><br>I got the Harness of Control from Vores, and went near the river to bring up track to see if the Broodmother was up.  As it happened, she was, however, some UBER guild was doing the 10th ring quest and shouted to the zone that anyone who did not want to get slammed by 200+ giants to get out of the zone.  I figured why chance it...and lose my leggins, Im out of here.  I came back after the quest was confirmed to be over and all the normal mobs in the zone re-popped (including the Broodmother).  I refreshed SoW, Invised up, medded to full, and headed into the first cavern to the left which twisted around a bit.  I got behind the Broodmother and turned the harness into her.  it gave some message like "her neck snapps and she begins heading out of the cave".  I re-invised up and followed running along side and near her. (BTW I highly reccomend having someone do this quest with you, stand near the Frost giant camp to ensure that no one steals, or attacks Fergul before the Broodmother gets there)  I took a chance and decided to /shout to the zone that I was doing a Quest and to please leave both the Broodmother and the two giants alone until I was finished.  It took about 2 to 3 minuites for the Broodmother to get to the camp.  She first goes up to the entrance to the camp as if she was going in, then circles back and attacks Grakkal.  At this point Fergul despawned.  I turned tward the zone, and he popped running away from me.  Due to seeing many posts here saying that get Fergul away from the action before aggroing I waited a bit before actually attempting to snare.  Snare held immediately (54 Druid) and then I kited him to the zone wall to avoid any adds.  I rooted, and casted Winged Death and meditated.  Im assuming after the Broodmother killed Grakkal, she made her way over to Fergul because I saw her come up and stop by his side.  I then knew that the "pet" stories are true.  I was almost afraid to reaply Winged Death on Fergul for fear that the BM would come up and attack (like normal pets do).  I casted, and she remained next to him.  I continued rooting and Dotting until he was half dead, and then I ended up not getting root fast enough and he came within Melee range.  This is where all hell broke loose, the instant i was in Fergul's range, the BM attacked and assisted Fergul.  I gained some distance between the two NPC's and  re-rooted Fergul.  The broodmother stopped by him and again acted like an unaggro pet.  Eventually I killed Fergul, the Broodmother then Depopped, and looted my leggings.  After this ordeal, I petitioned a GM and mentioned what had happened, he said to please do /bug and report my findings, and that he was happy to see  that I was able to get my leggins even with the reported trouble I had.  I /bug and hopefully all will see the patch repairing the problem in the near future.  I went as far as to tell the GM I would duplicate it for him if he wanted, but he said its not necessary.<br><br>This can be done solo as I am a 54 Druid with 171 wis, just use Form of the Howler and med while he is rooted and dotted.  I was oom when he was 10% health left, so  memmed Creeping Crud to keep him from regenerating HP back while I med and actually found that it took about 3 casts of that spell to drop him.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Beebe Lytcaster 51 Necromancer<br>Hiyeedi Fliess 54 Druid<br>~Rallos Zek~</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've been a victim of the bugs in this quest as well.  A friend who has done this before helped me collect the items and turn them into the right folks to get the harness of control.  When we found the broodmother up one day (in the shardwurm caves where she belongs), we ran in and I gave her the harness.  Then we both invised and ran up to the fort and waited for her to catch up.  When she did, all went as it should, she engaged the other giant and Fergul despawned, respawned, and took off running.  We gave chase and caught up to him on the plateau just above the pass to Great Divide.  His health was down around the r in Fergul when he vanished.  Poof.  Gone.  We were not anywhere close enough to the zone that he could be said to have escaped.  He was no longer in either of our target windows, so it's not that he gated or ghosted.  There was definitely no corpse.  We ran back to the fort but he was no where to be seen.  We watched a little longer, but nothing happened other than the yellow broodmother becoming the pet of a green giant.  <br><br>I petitioned and was told to email the head GM.  I emailed her and after two weeks with no reply I tried writing to the eqmail address.  They wrote back a few days later and said they'd tested it and it was working fine and referred me back to my GM.  When she finally replied she said that she could find in their logs that I had owned the harness of control, but she found no reference to me giving it to the broodmother.  <br><br>The moral of the story?  It's buggy and don't expect any help from the powers that be if you don't get your reward.  They're convinced that this quest is working perfectly, but it's not :(<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok I had been wanting these legs for couple months and finally hit lvl 54.  Well a friend of mine and guildie lvl 52 ranger(minian) told me he would help me do the quest.  So we start in thurg and go after the drakkel dire wolves to get the blood wolf to spawn.  At first we just kill the wolves one by one.  But after a while a druid tell me to just train like 12 of them at a time and its much quicker.  So we started training wolves, giants, basically anything that lached on to the guards.  So after around 40 wolves or so I see a message in ooc to come to loc neg 2300 and post 2500 or something.  I go there and nothing and then find out he ment both negatives.  So we continue training wolves and after around our 60th wolve my friend minian sees a blood on track.  So I go wait at druid spires and the he brings the wolf.  Killed it pretty easy and just rooted or snared the adds.  So now we are off to cc and about 2hrs in the quest.  We get to cc and think we can just go down to the queen and kill her.  So we head down get to dwarf city and take a med break when we see someone say something acid near zone.  So we go up and loot it.  Well about this time IM getting 5 tells for rezes and kind of pissed at all these people when we see herbalist spawns.  So minian levs both of us and we go to kill him.  We get about 5 adds and hes fine but im dieing.  So I jump all the way down the pit and try to run to city when I die.  He dies shortly after and I lose lvl 54. hah  Well I got a port back and went and rezed him and then he invis me and I went and got corpse.  So we go to the broodmother who was up 1 hr ago.  Well there seems to be a group that decided to KILL the broodmother thinking she dropped good loot /em sigh.  So we decide we have done enough tonight.  So the next nite I log back in and call to see if the brood is camped.  Yup she is so I tell the person to tell me when she spawns so I can start counting 10hrs.  Well I go back to kc and get lvl 54 back and the person tells me he is giving up on camp and logging.  So I get my ranger friend and we go back.  We call camp check and the broodmother isnt camped so I call her.  We start pulling wurms out and then decide to go in.  We see a monk run past us while running in and sit where the broodmother spawns.  I ask her what shes doing and she says camping broodmother.  I say WTF I got her cmaped and we get in this huge argument.  Anyways she realizes she cant finish the quest alone and leaves BAH.  So we sit down and begin medding.  I get info its going to be 2 hrs till broodmother spawns and decide ill wait it out.  Then all of a sudden this big wurm spawns while medding on top of me.  Im waiting for it to argo on us but doesnt.  WIERD ... so I target it and see Its the broodmother and start shouting woot .   So my group runs to the fort and I give her the harness.  She takes her time to get there(bout 3 mins)  and I follow her.  She gets there and attacks one of the giants.  We run after the other.  I cast root (Resist).  So I think im screwed but it argos on me Yayyyy!!!  So the ranger takes argo off of me and me the other cleric and shaman just root the adds and heal the ranger.  BOOM giant goes down.  I loot legs and im real happy now.  Great legs and the quest I would rate pretty easy if you got patience.<br>-Bagdak lvl 54 cleric on cazic<br>-Thanks for all the help Minian and the other shaman cleric<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This is an outline of the quest as I did it on the 12/05/01<br><br>Firstly, you do not need to hail or use keyphrases with any NPCs. I handed all items in whilst invis (and thus indifferent, my normal Coldain faction is dubious). There are 3 basic steps:<br><br>1) Get the sceptre from the Queen in CC. When I went in, a group had just killed her and, since nobody needed the sceptre (which I believe drops every time) they allowed me to loot. Return this to the named NPC given in the quest outline (he's located in a building on the left as you head past the guardhouse towards the hall where the Historian's giving his lecture).<br><br>2) Leave Thurgadin and head left from the river to the drakkel wolf area. I can confirm that the other wolves are placeholders for the blood wolf. Again, I got lucky as a bard was kiting the wolf and, not needing the drop, let me loot. Then, hand this and the gem to Vores, who is in a shelter by the river on the far side of the wurm caves from Thurgadin. You'll recieve a harness of control.<br><br>3) The final step is to hand this harness to the broodmother. She's on what I can only guess to be around a 24 hour spawn, and yet again I got lucky, logging in the following day to see her on track. She sets off on a trek up to the fort, and the 2 giants repop outside the fort. When she attacks, the one with the leggings runs and you should attack him once he's a resonable distance from the fort yet before he reaches the EW zone.<br><br>Now this is where I was surprised. I'm only a level 51 druid, and had a 58 druid for backup, but I could easily have killed him solo. I can only assume he's been changed since the last patch because the epic struggle outlined by another guy below was nothing like what I faced. Snare stuck on the second attempt, and my roots had about a 50 percent success rate, holding him long enough for the ES vambraces to do their work. I even had enough mana to throw a few starfires a him. He does have quite a few hps, but caused me no trouble at all.<br><br>I have no idea what happened to the broodmother, once the giant was dead I looted the leggings and left. Considering the stats, this is a remarkably easy quest, and well worth doing. When equipped, I can confirm they look like Tizmak. I just hope everyone else doing this quest is as lucky as I was )<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have a druid that solo'd this quest at 51, but it WAY easier to do it with 2 people, cause this guy has a TON of hp.<br>Here's how you need to do it:<br>Keep your level 5 root spell (grasping roots) up, and if god forbid you don't have ES vambs, you'll need drifting death and starfire.<br>You have to root, snare, DoT him to death, and you'll be oom for most of the battle. Snare won't tack him until he has about a sliver of hp, and he loves to resist root. When he doesn't resist it, you'll be lucky if you have 10 seconds of medding time before he breaks it, but you MUST have the level 5 root spell up so you can be sure to have enough mana to root him. I almost got smeared doing this by myself, and I didn't have ES gaunts at that time. I found myself shouting for someone to come help me because I was oom and he had close to half health left, but I did end up getting him eventually without help. Keep enough mana to snare him again, cause it will wear off before he goes down. You'll have to fight him for about a half hour or so to kill him.<br><br>Since getting mine, I've helped a number of guild mates with this quest (all 45+ druids). 2 druids can take this guy down pretty easily, but you still have to use the same method with one person DoTing him, and one casting a DD. And in all cases, both druids were oom by the time he fell, and I had ES gaunts for these.<br>If you're bold, and your AC is good with 200+ wis, you may attempt this with a 51 druid - but I really recommend finding someone else to help.<br><br>And in case you hadn't realized, these legs are far superior to Vermiculated. Still not as good as the new PoF dropped Harmony Greaves tho (which look like BADASS light green plate for druids). Kromiff leggings look like tizmak by the way - oh well =p<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

He is in the first door on the left, its a bar. You get nice exp at 47 for giving him the sceptre (dont know if the acid will work or not).<br>The second person you speak with is just west of the river, and South of the wurm cavern, good exp as well, watch out for wandering wurms in the area! Give him the gem (looks like a lightstone and the bloodwolf harness).<br>Broodmother is a 8-10 hour spawn, and you dont hail or anything, you just give her the control harness, and then you haul ars to the giant fort.<br><br>Here is how it went for me: My group isvis's and waits at the fort for me. The 2 giants pop, and we all target Fergul. Broodmother comes and attacks (YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR HER TO ATTACK OR YOU GET NOTHING), and I snare pull Fergul (resisted of course). My group hauls ars to a safer spot, with Fergul in tow. Well, Broodmother never killed the other giant, in fact the other giant just wandered around by the fort. Broodmother became the pet of Ferful the giant, and totally kicked my ars (red at 47). So, my cleric is now the subject of the broodmother attacks, and runs around in huge circles, while the rest of us (me naked still) attack the giant. The giant dies (fairly easy), and broodmother depops.<br><br>I was told if you are in melee range of the giant broodmother attacks. Please remember this quest is very buggy, and Broodmother in my case immediately became the giants pet. She was hitting for 174 x2 over and over on my poor druid, but the death was worth it. The leggings are relatively easy to get (gave them to my paladin with a fast log out/in and loot, and a 90% rez was given to me as well. The named giants are about as hard as a berserker, just a little more magic resistant.<br><br>I would also like to thank my guild for their help, and the help of about 5 other people who not only helped kill the giant, but who took serious damage from Broodmother, and who also did not loot the body (they did the most damage). It's nice to know people are still nice in parts of EQ. My thanks goes out to those folks.<br><br>I would also like to thank VI for Eci crashing for 30 minutes last night, since it reset the spawns, and Broodmother was up when I finally was able to log in, and only 3 people in the Great Divide. See, sometimes server crashes are good!<br><br>Oh, right after I got the leggings a Blood wolf wandered by... how handy to have another harness :)<br><br>Blackisis 42 Paladin<br>Lilwolf 47 Druid<br>Caracarn 53 Mage<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I did this quest last night solo with 19 others in zone no one helped me and had no problems with broodmother attacking me or being the giants pet. Heres how i did it solo<br><br>First i shouted that i was about to start it and asked that every one please not pull or go near the fort and that they dont bother broodmother as she left the caves. then i followed her invis to the fort were i selected the one i needed to kill and she attacked the other giant the one you need to kill the depops and repops right away and starts to run walk to the zone. if you attack him any were near broodmother she will become his pet wait tell hes half way to the zone then snare and kite him around or have your group come in and kill if, you attack or are attack by anything near broodmother, broodmother will become that things pet be a giant or wurm or wolf. I seen one night were some one turned in the harness and was attacked by a elder on the way out and broodmother became that wurms pet. After i was done kiting the giant for 30 mins finally taken him down with no mana i went to look for shardwurm and she had become a Dire wolfs pet hehe kinda funny seeing a level 40 wolf with a level 50 pet lol. If im correct when shes done killing the giant if theres another npc close by she will become that things pet if not she depops or maybe comes after the other giant not sure.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
