	   <tr><td colspan=2>This item can be obtained through the corrupt guards bracer quest with the Qeynos guards. Simply kill a corrupt guard in WK and turn it in (with indiff or better faction) in NK to Capt. Linarius for a chance, and it is a chance, to get teh Bunker Battle Blade. I've turned in maybe 20-30 bracers and I've got 3 Blades so far. I destroy them since my weakling enchanter self has no use for them. Good luck.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I've handed in over 100 bracelets and only seen this bunker battle blade once. Too bad i'm druid and can't use it...or sell/trade as it is lore/no drop.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Does anyone have any info from Verant on if this is going to be replaced/fixed/nerfed completely? I talked to cain last night and he told me how to complete the quest but said that he had no more bunker blades to give out. Does he give an alt. reward? If it has been nerfed are they going to pull the quest text? I love the premise of the quest but I dont want to drop four lego pads for nothing. Any info would be most appreciated.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
