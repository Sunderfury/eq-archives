	   <tr><td colspan=2>Links are from web site www.everquest.allakhazam  <br><br>Fletching kits are needed to make arrows and bows. They cost about a platinum and are available in Surefall Glades, north of Qeynos Hills, on the other side of Blackburrow from Everfrost zone. Arrow making supplies are available in Halas at Bloody blades. To get bow making supplies when your skill level is up to 40 or so, you will need to go to the city of Surefall Glades. You will need to be able to survive a run to Blackburrow (at South End of the zone in the valleys), if you go due south (when going down the ramp into everfrost peaks area from two tent area you are heading south), following the animal traffic, past 3 igloos, past 1 igloo, then turn east shortly there after at the large round rock, and follow the right wall you will come to Blackburrow entrance which looks like a large tunnel. If you are below level 10 you will want to travel in a group because the musicians are rampant along that path and the tunnel is guarded by several gnolls ready to jump on newbies. If you can&#8217;t survive them, you won&#8217;t survive the run through Blackburrow. You can run through blackburrow fast enough that you can live a full scale attack if you know the exit to North Qeynos. Blackburrow is a very tiny zone, it is a circular zone, with a large pit in the center that you will not survive as a newbie. Once you zone into BB, you pass 4 side chambers, 2 on each side, then the open area. Follow the left wall past the cave with a door (that leads to the dungeon), on to next cave which leads to North Qeynos. There are several small dead end caves there. The correct one has a log laying across the entrance, and just past it is a tree with a large opening into it. That is a pit trap, do not go into the tree. If you fall into the center pit and you are low level try to get on land rather than water, and just wait to be killed. You will then need to find someone to loot your corpse for you. Your only chance at survival is to yell for help, /y , and ask to be protected and guided out. Most hunters in the dungeon will be glad to do this. There is no way you will survive out on your own if you are under level 10 and unfamiliar with the zone. If you see other players, just say help me, if you don&#8217;t see anyone use the /y yell command. It puts a call of help out to close by people and tells them where you are. Once you get into the open again in NQ go straight out (this will be west), until you hit the path, and then take the path to the right. It leads to Surefall Glades. In surefall glades go past the building over the pond, and to the next building. In there are several venders that sell fletching supplies. Knarmon  <br><br>Arrows:  <br><br>Halas: Bloody Blades.  <br><br>Kelethin: platform of the Fletcher and the Emerald Warriors Guild, merchant Lanin at the tree in the middle  <br><br>Surefall Glade: in Jaggedpine Treefolk, merchant Livam T'Lant, and at the archery range, merchant Jarse Kedison  <br><br>East Commonlands: the inn at the very extreme northwest corner of the zone.  <br><br>Bows:  <br><br>Kelethin, platform of Trueshot bows, merchant Sylnis outside  <br><br>Surefall Glade, in Ranger Guildcabin, merchant Tonsia  <br><br>South Karana, in Centaur Camp (loc 246, -2504), at Centaur Ulan Meadowgreen  <br><br>Archery: Put in 1 practice point and then skill up by shooting.  <br><br>Get a bow from a fletcher, a hickory bow will be much better than what a vender sells, and a fletcher will either sell it cheap at 5 to 10 gold or give it to you. People that hunt in Blackburrow get hunters bows that they may sell or give to you. Shout out that you need a starter bow and see what happens.  <br><br>Put the bow in your range weapon slot. Get some arrows. At the vender at Bloody Blades you can buy them for 1s each, or you can get cheap arrows from a fletcher for a bit less. The minimum cost to make for a fletcher is about 6c, not much under 1s. You put up to 20 of these in your ammo slot. Hot wire a key for shooting and you are ready to go. You will need to be close to target but not too close, not too high above or below the target either. You will learn from experience. Once you use up your arrows move more from your inventory into the ammo slot if you have them. Arrows are great for getting a first hit in on hard to catch monsters, and can be used very effectively with other strategies as below in Sabrael&#8217;s guide. When you read on you will be astonished to learn that archery gives the highest hit points of any weapon in the game when you have a high class bow and arrows.  <br><br>Knarmon  <br><br>Making Arrows:  <br><br>Overview. Put a practice point into fletching. If you are really really cash poor put up to 20 practice points in it, but I think those points are better used for other things, as you will level up pretty fast making arrows. Basically you put one of the four different components (knocks, shafts/vanes, points, fletches) each into the fletching kit and hit combine. A success gives you 5 arrows which appear on your cursor, and you drop into an inventory slot. In general use the cheapest components until trivial, then use the next cheapest components until trivial. Below is a table of a reasonable progression to use. Do not stack components. I&#8217;ve gotten to skill level forty just by making my own arrows as I needed them, without trying to rapidly skill up. You could sell excess output to players if you are eager. You have a hard selling job ahead of you though. Note, vanes are for special high damage arrows latter on in your skilling up. They look like much cheaper shafts, and have the same function. Failure rates are such that it probably makes most sense to make the longest range arrow for its damage class, and when that is trivial move to next damage class. When you get to skill level 102 range 150 damage 3 arrows will be trivial, and you will have a 75% success rate with damage four arrows.  <br><br>Knarmon  <br><br>Making Bows:  <br><br>Overview: You get the components in Sure Fall glades, and combine them in same fletching kit that you make arrows. Don&#8217;t make bows until skill level is 30 or 40, due to high failure rates. In general, until you are a master you will just be using two components, the stave (4 types), and the string (3 types). Put them into the fletching kit and hit combine. When you are a master you start using planing tools OR a knife, cams, and apparently multiple strings to make bows that are extremely powerful and costly. Below is much information of the making and selling of bows. You have a choice of 100 or so combinations of things. When you examine the statistics, the highest damage bows are the simpe stave and hemp string. the planes, knives, cams, and other strings just decrease the delay slightly. You will be able to make a damage 13 bow at level 40 with good success rate. I suggest you not even attempt high damage bows until you are a master fletcher, as they cost to much to fail on, and the damage is not significantly high, with the cost being almost 100 fold greater to make. Knarmon  <br><br>Brief notes on archery and what bow and what arrow to use:  <br><br>On webs sites there are immense tables of the possible combination of materials. The important parameters are damage which is a combination of the arrow damage and bow damage, and range which is also a combination of the two. If you use the bow simply to get the initial hit in to get an animal to stop running from you, just use the cheapest bow and cheapest arrow. If on the other hand you use the bow as a repeat weapon to inflict damage, you want a high damage bow and arrow, short delay, with range allowing you more room in keeping distance as you run backwards sinking arrows into the beast. Total damage over time is a combination of damage and delay, with a shorter delay allowing more hits per time. So the best bows will have a high damage, short delay, and long range. The cheapest bow has a damage of 5, range of 50, and delay of 43. It is the hunting bow that vendors sell for 311c, and you get as loot at blackburrow. The cheapest arrow is damage 1, range 50, and costs a fletcher with no failures 6.2c per arrow to make, or 140c per 20. At slill level 60 I can make an elm bow about 50% of time with damage 13, delay 51, and range 75. It costs me 2523c per attempt. I sell them at cost, hopefully at profit as my failure rate drops at 5p. Customers are infrequent, but when interested never quibble over the price which makes me think I may be chargeing to little. A higher level bow which I hope to make later would be an oak bow with hemp string, and would have 21 damage, delay 65, range 125 and costs 86 pp per attempt to make. A darkwood bow with hemp string has damage of 25, delay of 68, and range of 150 and costs 281 pp per attempt to make. You can use whitling and planing tools but these seem to drop the delay at the cost of dropping damage too, are more difficult to make, and looking at the charts don&#8217;t seem to be worthwhile.  <br><br>There is a similar scenario for arrows, at 60 I made an arrow with a field point, bone shaft, rounded fletch, and medium knock that is damage 2 range 75. My success rate is 20 out of 34 attempts at skill level 59, cost per attempt is 25c per arrow if successful, or about 50c per arrow overall, or 1pp per 20. Talking to a successful fletcher, he keeps track of all his numbers, makes bows and arrows that he can succeeed at, sells them at a moderate profit, then goes back and makes more. My experience was I didn&#8217;t find any customers at all, until I started selling damage 3, range 150 arrows at 6pp per 20. Then I couldn&#8217;t hardly keep them in stock. Customers wanted 5 to 8 stacks at a time. Customers seem to be out in the field, not in the cities.  <br><br>Skilling up: You have infinite choices, but basically:  <br><br>Skill 1-10 put practice points in  <br><br>Skill 10 on up: start with making arrows, field point, wooden shaft, rounded fletch, large knock, and make until trivial. Then upgrade an ingredient and make until trivial. I chose what I upgraded to looking at the arrow charts, and what makes a useful arrow with the least upgrade in difficulty. I judge difficulty by cost of making, which seems a useful enough way to do it. So, just by going on this basis I suggest the following. If failures are too frequent look at the charts on the web sites, and back down your difficulty.  <br><br>NOTE Changes have been made in fletching, some are magical now, I think the steel bladed ones, and costs have changed, will update and correct these numbers as I gain first hand experience. <br><br>First I will give you the brief skilling up list, in which you make only the range 150 arrows for a given damage class. After that is a more exhaustive table that includes only useful arrows out of all the possible combinations. My impression is the150 range arrows gets the customers attention, and the price difference to make between a 50 range arrow and a 150 range arrow is trivial. There does not seem to be a difference in success rates either.  <br><br>1. field, wooden, parabolic, small. cost 99 damage 1 range 150  <br><br>2. field, bone, parabolic, small. cost 190, damage 2 range 150  <br><br>3. hooked, bone, parabolic, small. cost 574, damage 3, range 150 trivial at 102  <br><br>4. hooked, ceramic parabolic, small. cost 1909, damage 4, range 150  <br><br>5. hooked, steel, parabolic, small. cost 2991, damage 5, range 150  <br><br>6. bladed, steel, prabolic, small. cost 8550, damage 6, range 150  <br><br>7. bladed, steel, bone vane (carefull!!!), small. cost 10,210, damage 7, range 125  <br><br>8.

One attempt yields 5 arrows, so arrow 29, the most expensive will cost 12pp /5 or 2p4s per arrow if 100% successful.  <br><br>I welcome info confirming approximate costs (will vary due to charisma differences. I buy with a crude stein and it lowers costs about 10% and more importantly, the stats on each arrow, and triviality on each arrow, and which ones are now magical. I vaguely remember reading that the magical ones might produce more arrows per attempt.  <br><br>Skilling up on bows: I found that if I carried a few damage 13 bows around (rough elm) I sold them from time to time. Bows are too expensive to make to use for skilling up. There are 65 different bows that are reasonable to make as listed in <a href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/equipment/Bows.htm" target=_new>http://everquest.gamestats.com/equipment/Bows.htm</a> I&#8217;m going to list far fewer. I pay less attention to delay and look at damage and range in choosing which bows are worth making.  <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Knarmon Ironsmythe<br>www.geocities.com/sbc_huzzah<br>go to the vault</td></tr>
