	   <tr><td colspan=2>We have spent a lot of time down here and here is a edited post we had on our guild message board concerning this place.  This is primarily geared towards getting to and holding the library, but much of it applies to the entire place.<br><br>One other thing.  A well organized group of level 28 - 34's can move through 90% of the dungeon.  It will be a challenge, but it can be done, even without an enchanter.  Xalgoz and thr Runelord are the only two who probably can't be done by this group make up.<br><br>Here is the info....<br><br>It's one way and it's a LONG way back to the way out. This means if RUN! is called you don't try to get out (unless your a caster). Instead, you run to a "good dying point". That point is the place where you drop in. It is the ONLY place that can be gotten to without fighting stuff. So, if you can gate or feign, die there. <br><br>The FIRST things you fight are 3-4 spiders who can see through invis. They come as 1 pull. They cast and heal. They are a resonably tough kill with 6 armed and equipped characters. With everyone naked they are virtually impossible. So, I repeat, don't die behind them. And when you drop in, stay REAL close so as not to cause agro. (No peeking!)<br><br>Those of Evil alingnment will receive faction hits that will prevent you from being able to trade at the Outpost. Be aware of this. It may mean after Kaesora you wont be able to trade anywhere in Kunark.<br><br>There are healers down here as well as undead. So, stunning becomes important. Also, healers will assist from a distance so it is important to find them and either engage the healers or move the combat.<br><br>Pets are OK, as long as they are on a tight leash. Mobs in here are very close together in many places so, no one, pet or otherwise wanders around.<br><br>Respawn is 12-18 minutes. This is REALLY important as it is very easy to go from fighting 4 things to 8 because you have not moved or forgot to time the respawns. PULLERS! BE VERY AWARE OF THIS! IT IS THE NUMBER ONE KAESORA KILLER!<br><br>Combats are often with 3-6 things. This means diverse tactics and long fights. This also means exteneded down time between fights. Efficiency can be the difference between life and death. So everyone needs to talk to keep mana in balance and insure you are spending as little of it as you can.<br><br>Often a tough fight will still be won down here. More than half of the really bad fights I have seen in Kaesora were won by the party, not the Mobs. The result was often 50% or more party wipe out, but not complete. Keep this in mind. You probably should not run unless it is clearly going REALLY bad. It also means people may end up "sacraficing" themselves. Be smart if you get into that situation. Spend all your mana, all your skills, do everything you can to save the party if your going to go down. If someone drops everyone MAY need to change tactics. Be aware of this and be prepared to split mobs, take over healing, step up and take some damage. Again, once party members start dropping coordination is essential.<br><br>Lots of stuff down here casts mean spells. For pullers this means you may come back a bit "under the weather" and it may be best if you drop out of the fight for a bit so the cleric doesn't have to heal you until some decent agro is built up. For Clerics this means - buff your enchanter and keep an eye on him.  (assuming you have one) If his mez doesn't stick he will get evaporated. He needs to be hit immediately with greater heal or he will drop. (Greater heal because while your casting it the second nuke will hit him. Light heal will barely cover the damage from 1 of those nukes and you can't win a "nuke vrs. heal" race in this situation.)<br><br>Things wander in. Everyone needs to be aware and anounce adds. The wanderers can be BIG trouble. If it's a healer and the enchanter doesn't see it, it's going to cause havoc.<br><br>Nukers, be ready to alternate incineration techniques. Burn down the healers, leave the tanks, etc...<br><br>Pullers/targeters. It is often best to leave the healers for last. The enchanter will get them mezzed and having them trying to cast heals on others helps keep them off the enchanter while he is getting them under control.<br><br>Some things just plain don't want to be mezzed down here! So, the enchanter may make a shout - "I can't control %T!". Be prepared to SWITCH TARGETS or SPLIT TARGETS should this happen.<br><br>Many spiders things have damage sheilds. Opening with a "strip" will help the cleric out tremendously.<br><br>Ziff Harbinger<br>Enchanter of the 31st Trick<br>Loyal Founding Member - House of Bastards<br>Guild Leader - Dusk Eternal<br>Ayonae Ro Server<br>&nbsp;<br>Guild Leader - Dusk Eternal<br>www.dusketernal.org</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The Runelord Room:<br><br>Note, my party of two has not and will not attempt to take the runelord room.  Simply too many for us to handle at once.  My group of four however (Warrior, Ranger, Cleric, Bard, all lvl 40) had no real problems once we learned the trick.<br><br>There are two ways to reach the Runelords room.  One way is very quick and should only be attempted by groups with an enchanter or a large group of higher levels, around 46 or so i would think.<br><br>Upon entering Kaesora, you are prompted by two ways to drop down.  See my other message here for my findings on that.  Basically start off at the Frenzy room, (My other post describes how we got there).  Now instead of entering that room, continue onward, passing by that room and you will most likely meet a single spider spawn.  It was a quick and easy kill for our group.  In front of you, you will see a larger room that has a broken up floor in it.  There will be holes out in the floor and below it you can see another cave/room.  Go ahead and drop down, none of the times my group did this have we encountered a spider waiting there.  So it appears to be clean.  You will only take minor falling damage, Bardic safefall(caps at 25) is enough to keep you from taking any damage.  Now, looking at the EQ atlas map on Allakhazam's site, this room is labled as "7".  As you drop down, directly in front of you and to your left will be a tunnel.  This is the tunnel you will need to get back to the beginning of Kaesora so you can exit.  More of that later.<br><br>Now, directly behind you and to your right you will see another tunnel in the debris.  this will ultimately take you to the Runelords chambers.  Take that tunnel and follow it.  You will come across single spawns of spiders along the way, they will pose no real threat to you.  Kill them and keep on moving.  Eventually you will come to your first room.  In this room there may or may not be a wanderer, kill anything there and then take the exit tunnel to your immediate right.  This is a small tunnel that will take you to another room.  There is only really one other way to go from this room even though four tunnels lead from it.  The exit to your left dead ends immediately.  The exit in front of you has a ramp down to a tiny dead-end room where a single spider spawns.  With those two dead ending, and you having come from the third tunnely, that only leaves the one to your right.  Take the right tunnel and it immediately ends in another small room with a passage way to your left and straight ahead.  The one to your left is a drop down and leads to the same room with the single spider spawn that the previous rooms straight path lead to.  So if your ranger happens to go flying down the drop off for some odd reason (As ours did), never fear, you can easily recover him by having him walk out of the room and circle back to your position.  (takes about 8 seconds to traverse that loop, so these rooms are very close together).  NOTE:  It is important that you go ahead and kill the spider at that single spawn if you use a fear tactic to break the next rooms.  Since the left hand passage drops off and makes a loop, that only leaves the passage in front of you, take it and very soon you will come to a slight ramp up and above it you will see a small landing type area with a couple spiders in it. If you take a look at the EQ Atlas map that is on Allah's site, the top of this landing is at coordinates (300,300).  The landing actually goes a bit more to the right and out of sight, where there are two more spiders waiting.  Total of four spiders here.  Our group tried invis two times here and both times there was a healer in the mix that saw through invis and attacked us, turning it into a VERY nasty fight.  These spiders tend to be straithbones.  The Bristleweb and the Briarweb are nothing, the straithbones however are the necro/clerical types that I warned about in the previous post.  (Bristleweb's can also be caster types, but they are much lower and not really even a nuisance).  Meeting four casters at once, was very bad for our morale, we tried to fight but it was obvious we were going to loose this one.  We ran for the exit (Having scouted it out previously) and miraculously, we all lived, though several of us zoned on vapors.  Not having a reliable way to Mez out the mobs had us wondering how to take this.  We found a very nice and simple way to do it :)...Fear.  The area of effect version.  Normally doing this in a dungeon is asking for instant death and a train of epic proportions.  However, we killed every spawn from the broken floor room to this landing..so we got to thinking what is there to add on us??  We tried it and were correct.  Our ranger picked a target and rooted it, the bard used his AE Fear song (Any other clases verison...clerical comes to mind...would do as well).  Most of the spiders fled on the first pulse, and any there were left fled on the second.  The ranger followed his root with a snare on our mob so that if root broke it would give us some time to re-apply.  All the other spiders are away and its now a 4 on 1 fight.  If root breaks and he starts to run too far away, let him go and wait for them to come back.  Pick him out, root and take him down. Because we wanted to trim the odds very quickly, we had our cleric burn a little mana and assist the spiders death with a few nukes.  Otherwise our Cleric would have only used about a bar of mana during the entire fight.  Much better than our first horrible attempt.  When you are down to just two, I would suggest taking them straight up unless your resources are low.  Having mobs running around freely in a dungeon just gives me the willies, even if we did take precautions.  You should finish them up rather quickly.  Definitly buff yourself with any magic resistance you can get your hands on, these Straithbones will often cast Fear2 and if it lands it can ruin your day quickly.  Now, you've taken that room, rest up and med, its a long spawn cycle.  If you have managed to get through that fight without loosing hardly any mana and are full on hit points, then proceed to the next step.  Otherwise, rest up and wait for another spawn cycle of that room.  This time however you will be camped in that room and you can take them as they pop.  So you will be fighting singles again and taking very little damage.  Also note that on the other side of this landing, the corridore continues via a small ramp.  At the top of that ramp another spider will spawn and then proceed to roam around the tunnels.  Be ready for that as it will most likely add during one of your fights, maybe even your initial break..bringing your total to 5 spiders to clean out.  Once you've rested and taken the room a second time, immediately leave and continue on up the ramp, killing the wanderer if he happens by.  Now a short ways ahead the tunnel will continue to go up a ramp and ahead you will see the opening of a small room.  The ramp leading up to that is a bit wider than the one you are currently in...on that ramp up will be two spiders on the left hand side of the wall.  If you pull one, it will pull the other as well, but will not aggie anything from the room.  We had our ranger root the farthest one, causing the first to add.  We killed it easily (four on one against blues tends to do that :), we let the second one break root and come to us and took it out as well.  The room you now see above you is the Runelords area.  Inside there will be four spawns.  There is a small alcove on the left side of the room that will hold the Runelord or his Placeholder(PH). Spread out in the center and the right of the room will be three others (the tad pole mobs can spawn in these spots as well).  We had our ranger root one of them, wich brought the other three, our cleric then Atoned the rooted one so it didn't add during the fight when its root broke.  Next the ranger picked his target, rooted it and the bard turned on the fear.  Boom, down to a 4 on 1 fight again.  The runners will make it all the way back down to those couple of rooms that loop before fear wears off.  You've killed all the spawns from there to here so there is nothing that will add.  (this is the reason you want to take the time to kill that four spawn landing a second time if you don't kill it quick enough.  You have to take and finish the Runelord room before the landing repops if you wish to use fear tactics)  If you are unlucky enough to have the Runelord on the initial break (Lucky/unlucky is in the eyes of the beholder I reckon), then kill it first and fear the others.  The Runelord will cast a magical skin on himself and appears to be a Wizard or Enchanter class every time, (not sure but I think he is only Wizard class).  So take him out PRONTO.  The other spiders/tad poles will keep getting feared and running away and eventually you will get them all.  Again, we had our cleric burn a bit of mana and help nuke out the first few so we had the numbers slimmed down in our favor.  Once that is done, you now have the Runelord room and it will be no problem to hold.  So that it wasn't a boring camp, our group held the runelord room, the two-spawn outside that room, the wanderer on the landing below and the four-spawn on the landing, plus another random wanderer from below the four-spawn.  So we had a tottal of 11 spawns to kill every 18 minutes (Again, I don't have my notes, so this may be slightly off, but I believe they are on an 18 minute cycle).  We found we had more than enough mana to do this, keep our buffs up, med and still have some time where we just had to wait around.<br><br>Anyway, these are some things we learned the hard way and I thought I'd share :)<br><br>Tinywulf of Veeshan.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey all, hope this helps some of you who've never been to this great place.  There are some really good and informative posts here already.  Very worth reading over if you wish to adventure in this place.<br><br>A couple things to note,  This dungeon for the most part can be done with various party compositions.  Unlike a lot of dungeons, you are not necessarily locked out of this one if you don't have an Enchanter or a Bard.  In this case though, I wish to relate to experiences.  One is with a group of four, (Bard 40, Cleric 40, Warrior 40, Ranger 40)  and the other is with a group of two (Druid 45, Warrior 43<br><br>First thing to note is the maps to this place are still kind of confusing. When you enter, you will see two ways to go, both of them drop down.  NOTE: Once you drop down, it is a long and mob filled trek to get back out.  The drop down directly in front of you as you come in has two levels to it.  If you levitate (or just run and jump forward) you will land on the second level.  This level will allow you easy access ot the Frenzied room and beyond it, the library.  If you drop down that second time however..you wind up in the Runelord's chamber.  There will almost always be a healer there that can see invisible and there are four spawns in the room.  Bad place to be if you have no chanter.  NOTE: Corpse recoveries in this zone are HORRIBLE.  Due to the nature of the dungeon. They regularly mix living, undead and mobs that can see invisible together.  So unless you are a rogue, you will find corpse retrievel extreamly deadly.  If instead you drop off the left passage way, you will find that it goes down one level only.  Take a right and you'll be at the Frenzy room, much safer to take this route than to try and hop down and catch the second floor.<br><br>Now, after several tactics, I've found that the best method for both my groups was to basically fight their way all the way to the point they wished to camp.  (We've taken frenzied room, runelord room and Library).  Fighting your way down seems to be the best bet.  At lvl 40, you will find that almost all the mobs are blue to you, with a few greens mixed in, no gambles or tombs. <br><br>Going to the Library:<br>Taking the library is pretty easy, for my group of 2 and my group of 4.  Much easier in fact than taking the Runelord.  <br><br>Start off by hitting the Frenzied room.  when you enter the frenzied room there will be three spiders lined up against the back wall.  The frenzied, if hes up will spawn in the center position.  The little tad pole looking mobs can also spawn in these positions.  My group of four decided to take these three. We found out that if you take the spawn on the far left, you will only aggie the middle one and can basically keep it down to only fighting two at once.  Dont go far out into the room or you will aggie the third and be careful of backing your mob up into him.  Our warrior had the tendancy to knock the mob back minute distances until he finally got within aggie range and the third one added.  Things to note about this if you are using a bard.  The area of effect mez song we get at low levels is useless here.  At level 40 I could not mez a single mob on some of our bigger breaks.  I just aggied them all on me and almost got wiped out.  Instead, stick to your pixie strike (Mez) and your Bewitching Bravora (lvl 39 charm).  These two work wonders, and you shouldnt need them very often, just on the initial breaks.  Another note, you really need some kind of snare or root in this dungeon, even the undead like to run away and aggie others.  If you have a wizzy on runner duty, fine otherwise a druid, ranger, necor or Sk can do the snare job.  Make sure they get each one.  Next up are the two spider behind the door that leads to the secret passage you need to travers.  These two mobs are usually spiders.  With our group of four 40's we took them straight up.  Had the warrior aggie them, Let the ranger and warrior pummel away and the bard twist whatever buffs you prefer.  I would suggest that at least one of the buffs you twist be your level 13 song, Purifying Rythyms.  Gives you a poison, diseas and magic resistance buff, plus a little AC bonus.  The reason being isnt the poison effect on the spiders..that's really negligable.  tis the fact that the spiders can come in a couple flavors, Necromancers, shaman/cleric.  The necromancers are by far the worst, You will want diseas and poison resist to increase your chances of resisting their DD and Dots.  You will mainly want that Magic resistance because they will cast Fear2 and clinging darkness on you.  If Fear2 hits one of your party members, they can be in very deep trouble and it will most likely end in a corpse recovery.  So twist those res buffs!<br>the other songs you will want is charm/mez.  Mez is mainly to interrupt the spiders castings more than for crowd control.  Charm is just a nice bonus to save your healer a bit of mana.<br><br>Now, we've completed the Frenzied room and the 2 spiders behind the door.  Walk on through that door and find the secret passage thats on the left wall.  behind here you will go down a ramp, halfway down that ramp is a realtively safe place to med back up to full and recover if you need it.  Once in a blue moon you will find a skelatal warder that wonders to that area, but he stops at the bottom and won't aggie you if your halfway up the ramp.  Your other option with the spiders above was to invis and bypass them.  As long as there is no healer present the spiders wont detect you. Down below you at the bottom of the ramp is a landing that opens up into a small room/cave.  Inside are always 3 spawns.  They will be mixed undead/living usually, sometimes they spawn all undead.  In addition to this, there is a wanderer mob that roams the tunnels, usually a warder.  Warders are your biggest problem as they are clerical and have a hefty heal spell (i'm thinking superior healing).  They will turn the battle against you quickly if you dont neutralize them.  For our group, we jumped warders above any other target.  When they get right below half their life, the cast a heal.  Our warrior timed his bash and our cleric tossed a nuke while the bard was back up interrupt with his mez song.  Back to the room at hand.  The lul series of spells will actually work here it seems, we lull'd/pulled safely and at worst got 2 at once.  However our preferred tactic was to have the ranger root one to start the pull, then pick one of the two that come and beat it down quickly.  The damage to our party was pretty low downtime, taking three at once of course increased the amount of downtime.  After this room you will continue on down the corridor, taking any roamer you find.  you will also encounter another room-like area, very small.  This will contain 3 mobs as well, usually undead/living mixed.  Take them the same way. Heal up/med after that, you have some time.  I don't have my notes in front of me, but I believe the spawn cycle is on the order of 18 minutes.  Plenty of time to rest.  Continuing on from this room, the tunnel will open into a vast cavernous room.  This is the library.  Immediately to your right will be a single spawn, it can be a warder, minion or spectral guardian.  Take it down as well.  If you stand in the spot where that mob is and look forward you will see a staircase gradually leading to the "deck" type area that has a fountain on it.  to the left of that staircase, in the very back will be another spawn (minion/warder/spectral).  There is a spawn point just to the right of that staircase, on the "deck", it can be any of the normal types, but it seems to be a warder most often than not.  Our group took out all those spawns singly and then camped by the fountain and pulled to it.<br>When you sit in front of the fountain and look forward you will see the entrance to the library.  there are usually spawns in that open entrance area.  there is a spawn point on the right corner and usually one wanders by and takes up residence in the middle.  They may be pulled safely to your kill spot.  Be aware that the pull path is a little tricky when they come to the fountain.  It tends to come straight at you then path to the right near the stairs and walk along the bannister.  Now with both those spawns out of the way, you'r library awaits.  This is the tricky part..in the library will be two spawns and the possibility of a third.  After you round that initial corner, the Library is a small room with crashed bookshelves on the floor, the two normal spawns pop there.  The hallway continues on its right side and disappears around another corner to the left.  If you follow it you will find that it opens up onto a back porch with another three spawns right there.  An additional five more spawns are very nearby.  Now, if there is a wanderer in that corrider and you try to pull from the library, be very careful.  Watch that wanderer, if you back up and he turns around and runs out the back (As he is prone to do) you are going to have one MEGA train on your hands.  This is what wiped out my Two person group a couple times till we figured it out.  Always when pulling from the library, have your puller watch them close.  If they path out the back, run forward and they will re-aquire you and come back.  If that happens, take them right there in the library or you risk a train.  The librarian, tortured librarian were not very difficult.  They hit harder and more often than the other mobs you will have encountered, but they fell easily with little downtime on our part.  Be warned that the failed crypt raider looks like a skeleton and is a caster.  He almost wiped our party out before we discovered this.  Make him your target if he is in the spawn mix.  Once you've done this, you can med up and keep the library cleaned out.  Do not attempt to pull from the back porch.  Our group was doing great and wished some more exp, we had plenty of mana to spare once the spawn was broken.  Our pull from the back wiped us out and cost us a half-day corpse recovery process.  Here is why.  To the right of the library is another area kind of like the left side of the stairs.  There is a tunnel way that leads to a small house that has another named mob in it.  On the right side of the stiars is a spawn of 4 mobs.  When a wanderer comes down from that house, one of the mobs at that position, gives his up and becomes a wanderer, (almost always a warder!!!).  He has a very large heal range and can actually heal the mobs you are fighting without aggying himself on you.  to avoid this make sure you take all mobs that you pull to the fountain on the left side stairs.  This will avoid that long range healing.  But back to the point, when you pull from the back, those mobs will path around and get close enough to the spawns on the side to aggie them.  NOTE:  the side and back do not connect, they are physically separated by a barrier, but evidentally the mobs are close enough to aggie each other.  Well, when the side aggies, one of them tries to get to you by going up that tunnel to the house, thereby pulling all of those mobs on you.  very very ugly.  If you think a runner has gotten away from you, or a pull mysteriously does not show up as expected.  My advice is to get out of there PRONTO.  I know you dont want to, but corpse recovery is a major pain in this dungeon.<br><br>Ok, last thing to note.  As you are facing the library, to the right side is a narrow path around deck strip around the library, over the railing and below that strip is the four spawn on the right side that i mentioned earlier.  A warder will spawn on this strip and will aggie through the library onto you and he will heal the mobs you are fighting from around the corner.  You should also keep this spawn clean to hold the library.  NOTE:  to pull this warder, do NOT go after him.  Getting on that path will be close enough to aggie all four of the spawns over the railing.  If however you pull him with a snare or any other ranged spell, the mobs below will not aggy and you can safely dispose of the trouble maker.<br><br>wow, this got kinda long.  I'll post my findings on the Runelord in a separate message.  But to sum it up, both my 2 person and 4 person groups had no problems with this area once we understood how it works.  Cost us many evacs and several deaths to figure it out, but since then we've had no problems.  If taking those spawns is not enough, i would suggest going back up the tunnel and pulling that three spawn, you can do it safely without additional aggies.  you can also attempt the four spawn on the rightside of the stairs, however fight them where they stand, dont pull or you risk a train.<br><br>Thanks all,<br>Tinywulf of Veeshan.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Just the four of us...<br>Thayn Bloodraven, 43 Mage aka Fearless Leader<br>Aamok Tirebiter, 40 Cleric aka Bar Tender<br>Ryeux Lupine, 45 Druid... Village Idiot (and Evac)<br>Wryn, 45 Ranger Babe...*yowza*<br><br>We destroyed the Spectral Guardian at the entrance post haste and dropped down the shaft to the left... After dispatching some ill tempered arachnids, (Spider silks were dropped.) we proceeded to the Frenzied room and killed 2 rotations there, scoring a Cryptrobber's knife in the second round. Not much to sweat, but if you pull from the far end while standing in the hallway, you WILL agro what is behind the far door. FYI.<br><br>We passed through the door and killed the Ravener that was there... there was no apparent exit, but after consulting a map, we found the left hand wall to be fake and proceeded down the next ramp and sat at the bottom to med and heal up. (This is a safe place with only a wandering Guardian to disturb us... which he did, and we scored a dusty ransacker's pack.)<br><br>Notes on the next encounter: 2 visible mobs, one out of sight around a corner. Often these carry Fine Steel Great Staves, and they all fight like monks.. which is to say LOTS of damage output, low HP. Keep your tanks healed in the initial surge and you will win out fast.<br><br>Proceeding down to library level... 3 or 4 mobs encountered, all undead, and all dispatched easily. They are spaced well and no extra pulls were had. <br><br>Upon approach to the library, we carefully cleared out the front area and proceeded to the Fountain level in front of the entrance. Once there, the whole library aggro'd, about 4 mobs, including a librarian. These were dispatched and we entered the library proper.<br><br>In the next 4 hours we cleared the library consistantly and had 6 Librarians, 2 Failed Crypt Robbers and assorted trash pops...<br><br>We got a Kunzar Mantle, (No Drop 2 Wis, Dex, Agi and some AC) for lovely Wryn, a Sage's battle Staff, 4 Tomes a Spectral Mantle (Only good for twinking, 2 ac and some resists -yuck) a Spear of Mortification, and assorted other items. <br><br>NOTE ON MOBS: Do not count on single pulls, many mobs are concealed or just out of sight, but will aggro on otherwise simple pulls. The Skeletal minions are sometimes healers. This means while a single one will heal itself and be a nuisance, 3 or more spell disaster as some will heal the main while the main dishes out damage Monk style and hammers your tank. Damage Shields and DoTs are good to counter these and bringthem down faster. Tactic we used that was nice was also to begin a nuke (Or 2) when the Mob was at half that way when it is down to 1 bub and getting healed, you can nuke it into oblivion...<br><br>When we were done and bloated on Phat Lewt, we ported out to avoid the arduous trek to the top.<br><br>Bottom Line Here:<br><br>Illuminati of Light: 1<br>Kaesora Minions: 0<br><br><br>Thayn<br>&nbsp;<br>Thayn Bloodraven<br>Erudite Mage<br>Master Smith<br>Journeyman Tailor<br>Vazaelle</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Kaesora can be a nasty place if you don&#8217;t know it or if you are not careful.  It can also be very rewarding in terms of items, xp, and overall fun. <br><br>I've had three experiences in Kaesora that I will tell you about.  I hope those who read this will benefit from our failures and successes.  <br><br>First time in:<br>Party members &#8211; 35 Enchantress (me), 36 and 39 Paladin, 36 Mage-no pet, and 34 Druid<br>Destination &#8211; Library<br><br>As we entered, we killed the single undead that spawns in the entry area.<br><br>We buffed up in the entry and then made the two small drops to the left that lead to room 3 on the EQAtlas map.  We peeked around the corner into room 3 to assess the situation. There were 3 Spiders and a Ravener.  The Pallys attacked one spider while I Entranced (72 sec Mez) the remaining MOBs.  I AE stunned when needed on the casting spiders (Necros and Healers).  We take them out with some effort, but not too much.  Don&#8217;t let them run or you could get into trouble.  They can also stun you pretty good so don&#8217;t let them mob you.<br><br>Behind the door to the next small room are two more spawns. Usually a Ravener and a Spider.  We took them out easily by mezzing one of them.<br><br>A false wall to the left leads to the next area.  Between this wall and the next small room is a safe area to rest.  Invis vs. Undead is useful here for scouting and pulling as most MOBs are Undead after this point. The next small room has 3 Undead, which we took out in the same manner as before. Careful of the Guardians of Xalgoz or other creatures here that are somewhat transparent and hard to see.<br><br>The corridor past this room and up to the next room is a safe area.  The next small room has another 3 Undead.  Again we dispatched them with no problem. We had a healer (Warder) wander up and try to heal, but he was mezzed before he could even think about it. He was summarily beaten down for his actions after we took care of his buddies.<br><br>The entrance to the Library area might have a few more Undead, nothing difficult.  After clearing this area, we moved up the stairs to the Library courtyard/fountain area to set up camp.  Things were going good until we had a medium sized pull of 4 to 5 turn into 7 to 9.  I was able to control them mostly, but one of the transparent Guardians latched onto our Druid (which I failed to notice as I couldn&#8217;t see it)  and the next thing we knew, he was dead. I contribute his death to our lack of familiarity with the area/MOBs and his not being part of our normal group.  We finished the rest of them with moderate effort. AE mez at this point comes in useful, but I don&#8217;t like to use it unless there are more than 5 or 6 to mez because all mezzes break at the same time.<br><br>I decided to go back up and get him since I have Invis and Invis vs. Undead, which we thought we could use to sneak past everything back to the Library. Wrong! The Straithbone Healer spiders can see through normal Invis and Camo so the only way to get past them is to kill them.  If no Healers have spawned, then you will have no problem getting down to the Library. Just invis past the first two rooms and switch to Invis vs. Undead after you clear the room with the false wall.<br><br>Our situation turned bad at this point.  One of the Pallys was scouting, while we were figuring out how to get back down, when his Invis vs. Undead wore off and he pulled a small train that wiped himself and the other Pally out. The Mage was ordered to Gate after both Pallys used their Lay on Hands and were about to die.<br><br>We ended up having our Mage summon some weapons for the Pallys who had died and had to travel back from their bind points in Firiona Vie. We then attempted to take out the spider room again so that someone could go down and get the bodies.  Basically everyone ended up dying at least once and some several times, but we finally ended up getting all the bodies out to the drop point.  Casters could loot and then Gate out, but for non-Gaters it was a bit tricky. The best way is to have someone port you out.  If you don&#8217;t have a porter, you can have a caster jump down and drag your corpse to the edge of the lower drop and then Gate.  Have the caster jump back down on the first ledge (there are two) of the drop and summon the corpse up to this ledge and then let the owner summon it to the entry area from there. <br><br>One of our Pallys was able to use this method, but it didn&#8217;t work for the other.  Our Druid (and only porter) had already left so the other Pally was still stuck at the drop point (camp immediately if you are ever in this situation &#8211; get a porter to come when you can) when more stuff spawned and he ended up dying.  Needless to say, he logged after that. The next day he came back with a Necro and who summoned both of his corpses back to him.  If you know a Necro who can summon corpses, they would be a good thing to have along. =)<br><br><br>Second time in:<br>Group members: 36 Enchantress (me), 37 Mage, 38 Paladin, 37 Cleric, 36 Rogue, and a 35 Druid<br><br>Our group is a little more balanced this time around.  We go down again, but another group of low to high 40&#8217;s is just getting ready to go in front of us to take the Library. Hmmm.  We follow in their wake, letting them clear the MOBs on the way.  Once at the Library area, we decide to try the Hut room (number 4 on Atlas map).<br><br>One member, our Rogue, remembered a time here with another character where a pull of what looked like 2 to 3 turned into 8 or 10 so we were very wary at first about what to do.  We decided to go for it since we really had no other options.  The Rogue was right, it was a pull of around 10.  I waited until all of the MOBs were on the Pally and Rogue to cast my AoE mez, which caught all if not most of them. If any were missed, I Entranced them. Every twenty seconds I would recast AoE mez again (lasts only 24 secs) and Entrance any who resisted and aggro&#8217;d me.  Eventually, we whittled them down to only a few and finished them off.  No one was close to dying, but I was OOM and having to sit and med between mezzes.  Whew, the hard part was over and we were able to move into the cave behind the hut room (fairly safe area) to set up camp.  From here we pulled as they popped, which meant one to two at a time with occasional pulls of 4 to 5.  It was very easy considering what we had already gone through.  <br><br>After an hour or so of holding this area and getting a few good drops, I decided to see how far I could wedge myself into the back of the cave in order to safely AE mez without mezzing myself in the process.  Ugh! I moved forward into the furthest cranny I could and BAM, I got stuck facing the wall.  I couldn&#8217;t do anything to get myself out including ducking, jumping, sitting, etc.  I ended up camping to see if that would help. Hmmm. As I logged back on, I was at the zone line.  My party tried to recreate this in order to easily zone out without porting, but they couldn&#8217;t recreate what I&#8217;d done. Interesting bug.<br><br>No one died this night and we got a few good items, good xp, and had a great time.<br>Drops included: Deathwatch Sword and Icy Blade<br><br>Third time in:<br>Group members: 38 Enchantress (me), 37 Paladin, 34 Druid, 34 Wizard, and a 34 Monk<br><br>Same process as before to get down to Library. Camped at Library.  <br><br>Everything was going good for awhile.  Killed Tortured Librarian who dropped a Spirit Tome.   Things went bad when our Pally made a mistake by pulling a mob around the right side of the library instead of through the library. The entire hut area (10 or so more mobs) was pulled as a result of this.  We held them for awhile, but the last 2 or 3 were too much.  I ran out of mana and was killed.  Pally ordered the Evac shortly thereafter, but the spell fizzled 3 times and then the Wiz was OOM. Doh! Everyone died.  Always pull through the library!<br><br>After a few failed attempts to get our bodies out, we quit for the night.  I came back the next day and was able to invis past the spiders, as no healers had spawned, and get my body.  I later learned that the Pally had died 6 or more times doing suicide runs to drag his and the Druid&#8217;s body to the drop point.<br><br>Well, that&#8217;s it.  Sorry it was so long.  Hope you got something out of this.<br><br>-Kistalea <br>41 Enchantress on Saryrn<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>When Kunark first opened, one of the first dungeons we explored was Kaesora. As you first enter, you'll notice that dead ahead of you is a tunnel, which terminates in a long shaft downwards. With a high-30s, low-40s group, it's not an entirely bad idea to just drop down the shaft into the middle of a pack of npcs, and just start fighting. There's around five there, with one rare spawn - the strathbone runelord. Although none of the spiders see invis, some of the nibblers do - if you hug the left wall (I think), you -may- be able to get by them. At the back of the room is a little closet that can be safe, and has been used for resses before.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
