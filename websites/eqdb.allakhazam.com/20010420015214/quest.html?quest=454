He wants you to bring him the Pestilence Scythe and heart found on Lord Grimrot in SK.  Lord Grimrot spawns in two versions- a weak skeletal form (level 30 or so) that drops the heart, and a stronger human form (level 35 or so) with the scythe.  The strong form is a very rare spawn  (I have been told that he may be a triggered spawn, but I don't know how to trigger him).  Both have harm touch and all the other appropriate SK abilities.  The big version is very magic resistant, can solo a cyclops quite easily, and has no problems making mincemeat out of anything less than a full 35'ish group.   If you bring him back the scythe and the heart, he may reward you with the Aegis of Life, a very nice shield.  Here is the catch.  You need to have a very high amount of faction to complete this quest.  High end warmly is required. If you really want this item, I would suggest you kill putrid skeletons until you get no more faction hits, then do one of the lower end quests at least several hundred times to raise your faction (the bone chips, bandit sashes and donations quests all raise this faction), and then cross your fingers and hope it is enough, since there is no way to know if your faction is good enough until you actually give him the items.  (You can check faction by giving the scythe and seeing if you get more than a thank you, since the scythe is a little easier to get than the heart).  The faction you need is not as high as it used to be, but you still want to be careful with it.</td></tr>

I suspect there is something to getting this guy to spawn, like killing at 7am for undead, or whatever to make it spawn at midnight.  But nothing has worked for me.  Did the kill everything, did the 5/7 thing.. nada.<br><br>And these weeks multi-patches didn't help either.  Seems when the zone comes back up there isn't a ph.  So I had to wait around 3.5 hrs just to start my timer.  Sucks big time.<br><br>The worse thing is that's 2 weeks of no exp gain.  Yet I will go home after work and kill 2 more ph before bed.  Did the faction, got live one, 'am to far to turn back or run away.  And believe me, I really really want to run away.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I turned them in to the paladin in south qeynos using the "box for bones" quest and went from low indif to high kindly.. I believe this gives more bang for the buck than the regular 2 bonechips at a time with Novashine. I also handed in about 600 gold lol.. I will in a few days turn in 500 bone chips the Lashun Novashine way, maxing my faction without having to kill putrids or hunt rabid bears, all while waiting on a normally boring camp :) HINT: Level 45 High Elf worshipper of Tunare who killed a damn fish when he was little.. so I KNOW this is good faction.. from low dubious to high kindly.. <br><br>HINT FOR BONE CHIPS: Get a Velium Brawl Staff, 30/40 2HB, great look 3.6 weight all/all minus rogue and bard.. GREAT for camping spawns where low level thingsspawn in high numbers.. I can use them to kill and Donal's vambraces to heal, therebye saving mana for nuking the runner types :)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>POC to fix faction.<br>I killed Master Whopal in Nek forrest to get a halfling mask (my faction from PKing hummies needed a bit of extra help and the mask moved me from threat to dubious in South Qeynos).  Then I moved to LR and killed bandits for their bandit sashes (LR is a dark team owned zone on the PvP servers, safer).  My first time I turned in 70 sashes in halfling form from the mask in South Qeynos.  Luckily there is a merchant there to sell all the bronze that weighs you down from the quest reward when you turn in the sashes.  The faction hits I took were pleanty to move me from threat to indifferent with the guards, Paladins, and the Temple of Life (ones who give the quest), even in DE form.  My bloodsaber faction (evil hummie guilds in the catacombs of Qeynos)is gone though, but who cares, they did not like me anyway.  I have probably turned in another 160 to 200 sashes and am now warm in faction.  The temple of life loves me as do the good guards.  Couple things of note, there are "raiders" in SK that drop bandit sashes too.  They are along the water line between the bridge to NK and the treant camp.  I think there is 7 of them there.  Also killing the Putrid skeletons at Grimrot's camp will get you faction (but it is very small compared to the sash qeust).  So, while you camp Grim, kill the putrids and then every once in a while run over to the water and wipe out all the bandits.  Soon you will get pleanty of sashes and faction hits all while camping Grim (which is a LONG camp!).  Now if that stupid undead Grim will spawn, then this DE will soon be wearing a nice new shield from lighty land on his back.  BTW, it is fun as heck walking right through the front gates of Qeynos past the guards as a DE on a PvP server as all the lighties freak out!<br><br>Auz<br>Vallon FG<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I was able to get the undead version of grimrot to spawn 3 hours after i killed very first ph..&gt; after that, I camped the spot for 39 hours straight, and was finally able to get the live grimrot..&gt; As  49 cleric, i didn't think it would be to hard of a fight, as i was buffed to full, and had 1900 hitpoints. I started off by killing his pet in one hit of banish undead, and then grimrot proceeded to beat me like i owed him money. He 100% resisted everything i cast on him, and totally owned me. It took him all of about 2 minutes to kill me dead, and not one of my spells landed. After that experience, I decided to try a different tactic. This time, i switched to a 53 warrior, and started camping him. I got lucky, and he spawned after the first ph went down. As a 53 warrior, I had 2023 hitpoints, and was using a 2h mith staff. i comenced to kickin his butt. grimrot was casting quite frenquently, and was draining my strength, and also casting a life tap or something..probably vamprice embrace.  I completely ignored his pet, and just wacked at him. He fought till the very last swing, when he was dropped. His pet was a wuss, and could barely hit me at all, so after grimrot dropped i was able to kill him pet in about 4 or 5 swings of staff.  When it was all over, i added up all of hp's for the times i hit him, and it came to 2,143hp's.  This is probably due to the lifetap or something...i don't really know. Anyways i finished the fight with 294 hitpoints left, so it was a close call, I wasn't sure who was gonna run first...me or him, but i stuck with it and just prayed for the best..heheh.  i was able to loot both the lore, and the no drop versions of the scythe from him, and hope to be able to successfully multiquest the Aegis of Life.  GL to all who try this quest, and congratulations to those who already have it. It is hard to get, but well worth it.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hail fellow Norrathians!  I completed this quest a while back.. just been too occupied with other things to post.  Here's a basic rundown of what, where, how needs to be done and the faction to get it.<br><br>1)  As you know Camlend Serbold gives this quest which is in North Qeynos in that flying saucer thingy.  Don't worry about getting the quest now.. just go for grimrot.<br><br>2) Grimrot has 2 versions as you also know.. live and dead.  His PH is always a Standing Putrid Skeleton which stands underneath the tent with NO gold marker in the middle of the circle.  <br><br>I've found the best times to kill the PH to get the Live version is at 5pm to 8pm EQ time.  And the best times to get the Dead version is at 5am to 8am.  Just randomly killing it doesn't work.  Also the PH DOES NOT despawn at 7pm game time.  That has been changed apparently.<br><br>Both versions have a skely pet and they both will use their Harmtouch once attacked.  So have some buffs or a regen up. Live version has pretty good MR while the Undead version doesn't.<br><br>*Now I've heard that people kill the Undead Spawn and get both the heart and the scythe.  This is correct to an extent.  But both versions carry a Pestilence Scythe!  The difference is that the Live Version of Grim drops 2 versions of the Scythe.  One is a NO DROP Pestilence Scythe which has some poison/disease resist and 1 charge of Word of Shadow. (lifetap DOT)  That is the correct scythe!  The other version is just a LORE Pestilence Scythe with no stats. So the Undead drops the heart and LORE scythe and the Live drops the NO DROP scythe and LORE scythe.*<br><br>**Also you can use the charge on the Pest Scythe and it will still work in the final quest.**<br><br>3) Once you have both the NO DROP Scythe and the Heart it's time to work on that faction.  And the best way to check if you faction is good enough is to go to Camlend and ask him about Lord Grimrot.  You can get only so far before he says "I don't think I can trust you with this information yet" Or something to that extent.<br><br>I am a Agnostic High Elf Cleric and conned Amiable when I first started working on the Priests of Life faction.  This is what it took to get the quest (finally) from Camlend.<br><br>1) I turned in 30 Bandit Sash's in South Qeynos.  (info for bandit sash quest is in the South Qeynos quest section)<br>2) I turned in 10 stacks of bone chips to Lashun Novashine (who roams from the Temple of Life to the Newbie area, 2 bonechips at a time per trade slot)<br>3) Also turned in 800gp to Lashun. (2gp at a time)<br><br>By this time I was so Warmly I could have kicked Antonious Bayle in the privates and he would've hugged me for doing it.  ;)<br><br>I then went to Camlend and asked about Grimrot and finally he responded about finding Grim and bringing him his heart and scythe.  I am now the proud owner of an Aegis of Life.<br><br>Hope this helps and sets the records straight.<br><br>Seraphic Invasion<br>Brell Serilis<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I was in SK killing bandits for faction, when someone shouted that the live grimrot was up. I quickly sent the guy a message, as he said that he was going to kill him, and he agreed to let me loot. Unfortunatley, by the time i had got there, the corpse had rotted, and it got zilch.  I then sat down immediatley to pick up camp, and about 2 hours later the ph spawed. he was a standing putrid skelleton standing under the little plat with nothing on top of it. I promptly killed him as soon as he spawned, and about 3 hours and 20 minutes later, the undead version of grim spawned. I buffed myself up with everything i had, and killed him and his pet.  His pet died with one nuke, and i then rooted grim, he died with about 3 shots of banish undead.  it took all of about 23 seconds to kill the both of em.  I was really excited, because he dropped both the scythe and the heart, and then i read the boards here, and found out it was wrong scythe...i proceeded to cry..heheh. I am hoping to get lucky with the live version as well, but i won't hold my breathe. btw, im a 49 cleric, so i will prob have to get lots of help to kill the live version if what i hear about him being magic resistant is true<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello everyone,<br>This is a very ardous quest as I'm sure you have figured out so far.  I wanted to say a few things about my trials during this quest.  As far as killing him at different times of the day to get the different spawn types...&lt;shrug&gt; I did the 5&5 and the 7&7 and it never ensured that what I wanted would pop.  But since everyone that dosnt' agree with this method says just kill it whenever, why not.  As far as all that goes, Do yourself a favor and bind right in front of where he spawns.  Every time you get a chance log in and check to see if he's there.  If you get the PH, you know when you kill him he's gonna be back in 3-3.5 hours.  Just be persistant.  You will get him eventually.  In between spawns a good way to kill time is to hunt the RAIDERS that spawn east of the stone bridge along the water, about halfway to the treants.  They are not bandits but do drop sashes that you can turn in to the pally guy in Qeynos and get faction for this quest.  Second, about having enough faction to complete it.  If you talk to Camlend Serbold and say "Lord Grimrot" this will start his speech about the quest.  If he asks you if you are ready to "defend life"  then you DO have enough faction with him to turn in the components.  This happens when you have WARMLY faction with him.  Hope this helps at least someone out there.  <br><br>Zedeki, Cleric of Marr<br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First, let me say that I do not claim to be an authority on this quest.  I have completed it once and will share my experience in case it may help others.  <br>This quest took me about 40 hours to camp give or take an hour.  I decided to follow the 5 am / 5 pm recommendation.  The first night I killed the place holder at 5 am 3 times.  I never got Grim to spawn.  The next morning when I woke up, I loged on just to check and see if he was up and the undead version of Grim was up.  I can't guarantee it was because of the time I killed it as there may have been others that came during the 8 hours I wasn't online but it is possible I guess.  I have two accounts (no I don't have a life) so I had my level 50 cleric and level 51 warrior camped there. I loaded my warrior and easily killed the undead Grim.  My cleric didn't even have to heal my warrior and my warrior had no buffs on at all.  <br>I then spent several long days camping Grim.  I was killing at 5 pm at that point.  I was about to log to go to dinner and was waiting on my last spawn since I was timing it.  Much to my surprise (after about 40 hours total) the live version spawned.  I loaded my warrior and had my cleric there for heals.  I had a friend who was there playing his 45 wizard and we engaged Grim.  He was MUCH tougher to kill.  I had to heal my warrior several times with Celestial Heal and my wizard friend nuked several times but was almost resisted every time.  I could be wrong but I think the only spell he landed was a fire based one.  If anyone is interested, leave a post and I will double check and respond later.  <br>When the live Grim spawns, he is in pally armor (which kind of surprised me).  The place holder is the standing putrid skeleton under the little ruin.  I don't believe that killing any of the other skeletons in the area helps to force the spawn.  I turned in about 30 bandit sashes, 700 gold pieces (2 at a time), and killed probably 100 or so putrid skeletons.  Killing the putrid skeletons gives you the faction you need for the quest so I recommend killing them the entire time you are there to work on your faction while you work on this quest.  I have also heard that you can turn in bone chips to Lance Nova.....(whatever his name is) instead of gold pieces.  I don't know that this is correct but it might be worth a shot.  You turn them in two at a time just like the gold pieces.  If this works, just loot all of the skellies that you kill and you can turn their bone chips in for faction too.  <br>Like someone mentioned before, there is a pestilence scythe that drops off of both the live and dead versions that is not the one you need for the quest.  Each of the items have to be no drop for the quest.  Also as mentioned before, if you go to the guy in the temple and say "I come to defend (protect, can't remember the exact wording) life" and he tells you about Grim, then you are high enough faction to turn in the items for the Aegis.  <br>I realize that this isn't a lot of new information, but I just wanted to say that at least the 5 pm thing worked for me and that there is a possibility that the 5 am worked too.  Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to spawn time so I really can't say if they spawn at midnight or noon.  I hope this helps someone out with the quest though as this is a really good item.  If you have any questions please feel free to post them and I will answer them if I can.<br><br>Shalon Shadowwolf, 52 Druid<br>Keggar Dabrewmeister, 51 Warrior<br>Ruumm Forrezz, 50 Cleric<br>Mithaniel Marr Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I started this quest today, killed the ph at 5am game time and then after the three hours another ph spawned.  It was at 10pm game time.  I considered waiting because of the rumor about the 5am thing, but I thought what the heck and killed him.  After another three hours I logged in and the live version had spawned.  Someone had killed him before I got to him, but only because he attacked them.  They let me have the scythe which was fortunate :)<br><br>I raised my faction with the bone chips.  Give Lashun Novashine four at a time and you get two faction hits.  When I ran out of bones, and was at warmly, it took me about 30pp to get enough faction for them to tell me about the quest.  It took a LOT of bone chips from apprehensive, many backpacks full.  I lost count after a while.<br><br>I think it really is just random, not sure there is anything to this 5am/5pm thing because like I said, he spawned after I killed the ph at 10pm.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well I have started my quest for this bleeding shield. But I have spent 2 evenings killing placeholders and sleeping in 3 hours shifts. (/sigh) I have been killing the placeholders at 5 pm in the hopes of spawning the live grimrot since he is the harder of the two. Now, has anyone noticed as was stated in the previous post, that the live is a much rarer spawn? I have killed 10 placeholders now without so much as a grimmy spawn. Am i just that unlucky?<br>-Brother Sofaltis D'Estrella<br>Rallos Zek<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I got aegis of life in 2 real life days..This is how its done but this is gonna be brief for I dont have much time.<br><br>Undead version:<br>Go to skele camp in Sk. Look for a putrid skeleton that is already standing up. Note that all but one putrid skeleton is standing up. The only standing putrid is the Place holder of either version. If you see the standing putrid wait to kill him till 5am ish eq time. Now the next spawn will be either the undead grim or another standing putrid. If its the grim then grats! If its another ph dont kill until 5am ish again. The spawn time for either the ph or grim is 3 hours 15 minutes on average, varies from 3 hours to 3 hours 30 mins. So log out of the game and set a timer if you like thats what I did =)<br><br>Live version:<br>Same thing as above, same spawn times except you gotta kill the ph around 5pm eq time. Now for the live version, you will get lots of phs, if you get a ph wait to kill him around 5pm again-This is important people. I got 4 phs for the live grim rot, And I only got 1 ph for the undead version.<br><br>I got aegis in 2 real life days but I was not on line much. I timed all the spawns and logged off and logged back on a little early before the ph/grim spawn.<br><br>Not sure if you HAVE to kill the phs at 5 am or 5pm but that is what I did. If you do not kill them 5am ish or 5pm ish at least be consistent with your kill times of the phs! Grim is a random spawn but can be helped out by killing his phs at consistent times! There is no despawn people. And there is no 12am 12pm crap!<br><br>Faction:<br>I did soulire and my faction is already pretty good. I did do the fish quest for about an hour near the temple of life. I then turned in my no drop stuff and presto I got it!!!<br><br>Good luck<br>51 cavalier<br>Bristlebane<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Low HP and MR.<br><br>The live version concidered 3 different levels at three different spawns. White, Yellow and Red. All three very nasty. High HP and MR.<br><br>I can say there is NO logic to the spawns, just kill the PH and go on, I tried killing the PH at all different times, 5am/pm, 12am/pm nothing worked it was random. <br><br>The PH DOESN'T despawn. The PH is under the "tent" in the middle of three gold topped tents, the tent the PH spawns in does not have a gold top. <br><br>The PH is the STANDING putrid skeleton with a rusty Bastard sword. NOT the sitting small putrid skeleton with the bastardsword that spawns.<br><br>I never did anything to messup or improve my faction with the ToL before beginging this quest. I killed about 100 putrid skeletons, got the faction hit for killing 3 live Grimrots, and turned in 100pp to Novashine and that was plenty of faction for the quest.<br><br>Hi to everyone I met doing this quest on the Emarr server.<br><br>Crescentnight Brokensoul<br>34th DE Cleric of Innoruuk<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
