By order of the  Council of Qeynos I have been given the duty of apprehending the individuals [responsible] for unleashing this terrible plague upon the people and <br>the lands of Antonius Bayle. The more I look into this matter, the more I come to find that this will be no easy task.<br><br>You say, 'what responsible ?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'The plague unleashed upon the Plains of Karana is the work of the followers of Bertoxxulous. Those responsible belong to group known as the Bloodsabers though there were others involved as well. <br>Some time back, they launched a plot to overthrow Antonius Bayle and our ruling<br>council. Their [plan] failed.<br><br>You say, 'what plan ?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Their plan was to unleash a plague so deadly and virulent that it would wipe out all life from here to Highpass Hold. They planned to brand themselves and their foul allies with a rune that would have rendered them immune to the effects of this plague. From that point<br>they would have been able to simply walk in, easily defeat the weakened stragglers and declare themselves the rulers of this kingdom by default. But they were [careless].<br><br>You say, 'how they were careless ?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'The sudden influx of scoundrels and loathsome individuals was our first tip off. They required a rather enormous number of supplies, materials and manpower to construct the ornate altars, craft and enchant their runed branding irons and supply their armies with the weapons<br>needed for the cleanup work afterward. They needed to rely upon [outside help]. <br><br>You say, 'what outside help ?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'They mostly chose to hire bandits and brigands who are foolishly more concerned with immediate profits than the long-term effects of their actions. But once they knew we were on to them they even<br>started hiring some of the more 'civil' gnolls, if there is such a thing.  Gnolls tend to be easy to push around, stupid, and they work very cheaply.  They knew their time was short and they were desperate. Choosing to work with untrustworthy, lazy scoundrels caused the whole thing to begin to<br>[unravel], praise Rodcet!<br><br>You say, 'what about unravel ?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Their workers were careless. Aside from noticing the unsavory element in our city, our citizens began to run across many of the strange items and materials that were being trafficked into our city en masse. It was at that point that the citizens began to [complain] quite<br>loudly about all of this.<br><br>You say, 'what complain ?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Obviously, they questioned the meaning behind these events and rightfully so. They were frightened much as they are now. I admit, I was remiss in my duties for not noticing it sooner. One of the<br>biggest complainers during this time was a man by the name of [Earron Huntlan], proprieter of the famed Lion's Mane tavern. Though he is just a simple merchant, he did us a great service.<br><br>You say, 'who is Earron Huntlan ?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Earron is quite a character. He gets all kinds of travelers stopping by his inn for a drink or whatever other business. His patrons started telling stories of being mugged and harassed by these<br>loathsome individuals in the very streets of our fair city. Of course, he was concerned. So he became a kind of advocate for this cause, ringing the [alarm] bell as it were. I admit, at first I did not believe the <br>conspiracy.  I simply could not believe it was all happening under our nose.<br><br>You say, 'what alarm ?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Well, he succeeded in whipping the populace into a frenzy. He even got the famous wizard Al'Kabor to help him out by determining the nature of the strange items many of our citizens were finding. Getting that man to do anything not directly related to his research is not an easy thing to accomplish either. Needless to say, at <br>that point I saw the truth and the Prime Healer forgive me for not seeing it sooner. Were it not for the investigations and general outcry of [concerned citizens], we might not be standing here talking today.<br><br>You say, 'what concerned citizens ?'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Yes, it was citizens like you that helped to save Qeynos that day. We uncovered their plot, captured the man who was in charge and put him to death. Of course, the Bloodsabers retaliated and using their incomplete research still managed to unleash the plague we face now. <br>Though devastating in its own right, you must admit it is rather mild compared <br>to what it might have been. I thank you for your interest. Perhaps you would be willing to [help] me?<br><br>You say, 'I am willing to help you'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Excellent! The more I learn from my investigators the more I find that these Bloodsabers have stretched their tendrils of influence all throughout our beloved city. Nevertheless, we are committed to exposing these fiends once and for all. Perhaps you would like to become an [investigator]? <br><br>You say, 'I would like to become an investigator'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Very well then, Durix . We will not allow just anyone<br>to wear the official Investigator's Badge and please forgive me. . . But it is hard to tell where one's loyalties lie these days. If you are truly [serious] then there is a duty you must perform first to show you are <br>on the side of Antonius Bayle, the council and the good people Qeynos.<br><br>You say, 'I am truly serious'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'There is a guard by the name of Robbie Shilster that patrols the Northern Plains of Karana. He is allied with our enemies and completely corrupt. He is flagrant in his trafficking of contraband <br>goods.  His orders are to guard the great wooden bridge to stave off the insect<br>swarms. But our investigators report that he simply stands to the side and watches as the swarm rolls through. You are to execute this man for his treason and bring me his helm. Then, we will talk.<br><br>Go North Karana  and go north of the wooden bridge, near the wall.  Find Guard Shilster and kill him and loot a Cracked Corrupt Guard Helm.<br><br>Run back to Qeynos<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Vegalys Keldrane'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Thank you for bringing this person to justice. Please<br>read this manual very, VERY carefully. Commit it to memory. We do everything<br>strictly by the book. We are a people of law and order and I simply won't tolerate a breach of protocol. Investigators are expected to accurately report findings, are authorized to issue warrants and to notarize <br>official documents for all lands under the jurisdiction of Antonius Bayle and the<br>council. I sincerely hope you can earn your Investigator's Badge.<br><br>Your faction standing with AntoniusBayle got better.<br>Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got better.<br>Your faction standing with RingofScale got worse.<br>Your faction standing with KaneBayle got worse.<br>Your faction standing with MerchantsofQeynos got better.<br>You gain experience!!<br><br>Go to South Qeynos. At a tree south of the Lions Mane tavern you will meet an investigator in a yellow robe. Give him the book.<br><br>an investigator says 'Grouping with Durix'<br>an investigator says 'Very well, let's get to work. I assume you have read the briefing and committed it to memory. This is how you will be tested. I shall play the part of student and you shall play the master who <br>directs me.  I promise I won't make it easy on you either, we want only the best. <br>We'll see how you do and then I'll decide if you are worthy to wear the badge or not. <br><br>You say, 'where is the first suspect ?'<br><br>an investigator says 'The first suspect was last seen near the shop called Fireprides. <br>(Its the armor store near the bank)<br><br>You say, 'follow me'<br><br>an investigator says 'Following Master.'<br><br>(The investigator follows you like a pet but the pathing of S Qeynos is VERY buggy so you need to wait and go very slowly of you want the investigator to really follow you. Each time you ask for a confession, you have to ask the investigator to follow you again. <br><br>Look for Riley Shplots <br><br>You say, 'are you a member of the Bloodsabers ?'<br><br>Riley Shplots shakes visibly and says, 'Oh, no. I knew this would happen one day. Please don't hurt me! I had very little to do with this plague, though it is quite a nice one, you must admit. I was just a courier. I'll come quietly. I don't want any trouble. My small contribution to the glory of Bertoxxulous has already been given but I certainly don't want to go to <br>meet him just yet!' <br><br>You say, 'give me a confession document '<br>an investigator says 'Here you are.<br><br>You say, 'summon a guard'<br><br>Guard Sylus says 'Come along, prisoner.<br><br>You say, 'where is the second suspect ?'<br><br>an investigator says 'The second suspect was sighted below the Grounds of Fate. (under the arena, near the cells)<br><br>You say, 'follow me'<br><br>Look for Willie Garrote <br><br>You say, 'are you a member of the Bloodsabers ?'<br><br>Willie Garrote says 'A Bloodsaber? Of course I'm not, don't be ridiculous!<br><br>You say, 'give me a confession document'<br><br>an investigator says 'Here you are.<br><br>You say, 'summon a guard'<br><br>Guard Sylus says 'Come along, fiend. We haven't far to go.<br><br>You say, 'where is the third suspect ?'<br><br>an investigator says 'The last suspect has been known to hang around that low life known as Raz the Rat.  (near the docks, on the shore)<br><br>You say, 'follow me'<br><br>an investigator says 'Following Master.'<br><br>Look for Donally Stultz <br><br>You say, 'are you a Bloodsaber?'<br><br>Donally Stultz says 'Of course I'm a Bloodsaber, you fool! I've just returned from the Plains of Karana where I was reveling in the glory of  the Plaguebringer. Now then, since I see that this foolish investigator is with you, I suppose you want me to sign a confession document or something like that? Well, let's have it then!<br><br>You say, 'give me a confession document'<br><br>an investigator says 'Here you are.<br><br>Donally Stultz crumples the document into a ball, throws it to the ground and spits in your face, yelling, 'You are a fool if you really believe I would sign such a thing. Prepare to die!'<br><br>Kill him and loot his head.<br><br>Give the investigator the two confessions and the one head.<br><br>an investigator says 'You have done our city a great service and helped to bring several criminals to justice this day! Wear this Investigator's Badge with pride! Speak again with Vegalys Keldrane, he may have information about [advancing further] in rank.<br><br>Your faction standing with AntoniusBayle got better.<br>Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got better.<br>Your faction standing with RingofScale got worse.<br>Your faction standing with KaneBayle got worse.<br>Your faction standing with MerchantsofQeynos got better.<br><br>You get your Investigator badge<br><br>You say, 'I want to advance further in rank'<br><br>Vegalys Keldrane says 'At this point, I am mainly in need of loyal and trustworthy investigators. I must first gather information on who these people are and exactly how far their influences stretch. However, once I begin to implement the next phase of this operation, you may be able to assist us once again if you prove to be talented enough. For now, simply continue to observe and report. </td></tr>

Harm Touched me for 171 points of damage, consistent with the level cap of a shadowknight's HT.  He had no pet, and was cake really.  As for spawn time, that was unusual.  When we first got there, he didn't spawn for quite a while.  It was about 2 or 3 PM that he spawned and he wouldn't spawn again until the dead of night, roughly around 2 or 3 AM.  Hope this helps, he might be a 12 hour (game time) spawn.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>-Battousai the Manslayer<br>-Sahaqiel O'Neil<br>Brell Serillis</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>this is a good quest, and depending on your level, it seems to be fairly easy, but then i am a lvl 55 druid. The biggest part of this portion of the quest is whether you are kos to the corrupt guard faction. If you are you might try going wolf/bear form as qeynos is the only city i know where i can run around in as a wolf and I did so since form of the howler does give a mana regen. My buddy, Blayda Winterhawk, ran around in bear form watching me perform this first step of the quest, that and he knew Qeynos much better than I, and helped me get to the locations necessary to obtain confessions. <br><br>I must say that reading the player comments helped immensely. I have but one suggestion. <br><br>It is suggested to just go ahead and kill Donally Stultz and obtain his head without asking the investigator for an unsigned confession. This is somewhat in error as the second stage of this quest (interrogator's badge) requires the use of one unsigned confession. My suggestion is to ask the investigator for the unsigned confession, Do NOT give Donally the unsigned confession rather just put it in your inventory for the next stage of the quest. Now you can attack Donally, kill him, and loot his head. <br><br>I guess I do have one other suggestion and that concerns the investigator. As was posted earlier, he has a tendency to keep moving around and has lousy pathing. Use the pet command /pet guard here to stop him from moving around when talking with each suspect. When getting ready to kill Donally Stultz, make sure you park the investigator outside of your aggro range and Donally's aggro range unless you need him to fight your battle. Unfortunately, Donally can and will kill the investigator. When the investigator dies, he despawns and it seems to take a while for him to repop (maybe an hour). If you have to wait to turn in the 2 signed confessions and the head, it is all well and good but remember that when you do turn in the items the investigator despawns again and there might be someone else wanting to do this quest..Happened to my son and i am afraid another player had to wait for the investigator to pop again. <br><br>Dekkon Fuzzyfeet <br>lvl 55 Preserver <br>The Final Covenant <br>Innoruuk Server<br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have a number of alts that can use the badge series item. After doing this quest about 5 times I found a couple of ways to make things easier.<br><br>1. the invesitagtor never has to leave the spot for the scripting to work. so after you give him you book park the investigator there. like the previous posts suggested I used /pet guard here. <br><br>2. a majority of the events are sequentially triggered by the investigator. so you don't have to read the story if you don't want to.<br><br>3. anyone can kill the mob for you, you just have to do the looting.<br><br>4. not all the mobs are triggered. just ones after you hand in you book. If the investigator should disappear for whatever reason, he will respawn in 30 to 60 min, whether you trigger him or not.<br><br><br>The step by step method went like this.<br><br>1. kill Guard Shilster north of wooden bridge in N. Karana, loot helmet.<br><br>2. hand in helmet to Vegalys Keldrane (he is on the upper wall above gate to N. Qeynos). Vegalys will give you a book.<br><br>3. hand in the book to an Investigator by the tree near Lions Mane inn in S. Qeynos. He will become your pet. park him right there (i used /pet guard here, don't know if the other pet commands work).<br><br>4. say, to the Investigator, 'where is first suspect'. then say 'give me a confession document', the investigator gives you one. then run to fire prides and give confession document to Riley Shplots. In your inventory will be the signed confession. <br><br>5. go back to Investigator and say 'summon a guard'. Then say 'where is the second suspect'. then say 'give me a confession document', the investigator gives you one. go to the cell area below the arena and give confession document to Willie Garrote. In your inventory will be Willie's signed confession.<br><br>6. go back to Investigator and say 'summon a guard'. Then say 'where is the third suspect'. then say 'give me a confession document', the investigator gives you one. I then had a friend kill Donally (who is on the shore by the docks)and I looted the head.<br><br>7. go back to the Investigator and say 'give me a confession document'. He gives you one. Then give the investigator the 2 signed confessions and the head. In your inventory will be the investigator's badge.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've been trying to complete this quest over the last 4 days now.  After doing this 4 or 5 times, the info is close to blurring in my mind, but I'll try and keep each step seperate.<br><br>First of all, you'd better have decent faction with the QGuards, Corrupted QGuards, Steel Warriors, and the various churchy caster guilds.  I was happily dubious with the last 2 groups, so it was just a matter of making up with the Qeynos Guards - they didn't dig my treant massacree. <br><br>Faction is easily fixable using the Honey Mead for Trumpy quest to get up to Amiable with the Circle of Unseen hands, then the Rogue's Errands to get to Ally, then forcefeed Captain Rohand brandy to get in good with the Qeynos Guards.  With this technique, my faction with Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Tradefolk, Coalition of Tradefolk Illegal, Qeynos Merchants, Antonius Bayle, Guards of Qeynos, and Corrupt Qeynos Guards could not possibly get any better.  You'll fing Trumpy either by the 2nd dock by the Erudite chanter, or in the bar just behind said dock.  The rogue guild is found under Crow's Bar in QN, go in the closet in back then through the butt fugly painting.  Rohand is all alone in the Mermaid's Inn - and he's on a strange faction.  The QGuards were screaming for my blood, the Circle was Allied, he looked on me Warmly.<br><br>Now that your faction is good enough to wander around Qeynos without confrontation, head to the North Gate.  In the keep above it, you'll find Vegalys.  Feed him his lines, bind yourself, and try to get a SoW for the run to NK.  As has been widely reported, Guard Shilster is at the furthest NorthEast point in the zone, and will not wander.  Turning in his helm got me 1/2 a bluebble at 41, each time - I'm a little curious to find out his spawn rate.  A porting class could farm some serious xp making the run between Vegalys and Shilster.  Oh yeah, to state the obvious; he's a Bloodsaber, and therefore a necro or SK.  He was petless all four times I killed him, so I'm guessing SK.  You get the following faction hits: -Corrupt QGuards, +QGuards, +Temple of Life, +Knights of Thunder.<br><br>Now, on to the Investigator.  He spawns a few minutes after to give Vegalys the helm, in QS next to a tree by the docks.  He's a pet, so I couldn't make another - I WAS able to Augment Death him, tho :D  The first suspect is in the forge directly West of the docks.  Get the Document, ask him if he's a Bloodsaber, then hand him said Document.  You'll get the NoDrop Signed Confession in exchange, then ask the Investigator to summon a guard.  Be sure to target whomever you're talking to.  If you're worried about your new pet wandering off, tell him to /pet guard here.  The second suspect is under the Arena - the Investigator won't wanna take any other route.  Just lead him straight West from the forge to the ramp leading down.  Make 2 lefts through the gate/door, you'll pass a Barbarian guild guard into a bloodspattered room with hooks on the ceiling.  Do your thing with Willie, then off to the docks.  I suggest posting your pet AWAY from here, he loves to join in - and if an NPC gets the last hit, goodbye Donnaly.  On that note, keep an eye peeled for any wandering guards; I have been KSed by Corrupt Guards, QGuards, and (once) was tripled for 350 by  guildmaster Kazlo Naedra.  Donnaly is a fistfighting necro who maxes for around 50.  Big Sissy.<br><br>IMPORTANT: Get another Confession Document BEFORE handing An Investigator the 2 signed confessions and the head.  If you forget to (I did, a few times), you can get one from him if someone else repops him.  If no one else has, it's back to NK for you.<br><br><br>Markoff Chaney<br>Gnecro of the 41st Corpse<br>Caterer to the Dwarves<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The main thing wrong with this crappy quest is that it is not like the multipart velious quests.  Unlike the coldain ring and shawl quests, you do NOT get your badge back after turning it in to start the next part of the quest. This means that until you reach the final badge, you're never going to get to use the item, since most people will turn it in after they finish one part to start the next.  The only way you'll get to use it is if your ead spoiler boards and see that you're not ready for the next part.  <br><br>Know what else this means?  It means that if you screw up one part of the quest, you do EVERYTHING OVER!! Starting at the first freaking one.  Most of the people I see waiting for investigator are redoing the damned quest because they screwed up.<br><br>Some things to remember before you start:<br><br>Pathing in NQ sucks.  Keep the investigator close.  I am KOS to steel warriors and bards, and when I go under arena, the pet runs all the way around to the other side instead of going through tunnel, therey killing himself.<br><br>Do not cast invis with the pet up, he won't poof, but will attack you.<br><br>There is no faction hit for killing investigator (I mention this because people like to piss others off by killing investigator).<br><br>After you kill the final guy by docks, MAKE SURE you ask the investigator for another confession document before giving him the head and signed confessions.  You will need a blank confession document for the 2nd part of the quest, meaning that if you don't get it here, you have to kill the guard in NK again and go back and make the guy your pet again.<br><br>Whoever designed this quest has obviously never tested it. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You realy would have a hard time doing this if your KOS. Actualy doing this will make your faction even worse with the corrupt guards. Your best bet is to try to change you faction with them, of course most ways to do that will also drop your faction with the  good guards. <br><br>The easyest way is if you have some way to alter your form.  a druid hase wolf form. Shamans have Bear froms. Enchanters have every other form in the world. I play a druid and i know at 34 druids get share wolf form. find one of themto give you wolf form then run the quest that should fix your KOS faction as least enought to keep you form being KOS.<br>&nbsp;<br>Edward is BUIISSY! </td></tr>
