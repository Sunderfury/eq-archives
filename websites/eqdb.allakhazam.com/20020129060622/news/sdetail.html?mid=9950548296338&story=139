	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here's a message I sent to AO Tech Support & Marketing, and though I'm listing it here, it is NOT meant to bash the developers of this game:<br><br>Subject: Apartment Bug; Hotkey Issue; Action Window Issue; First Free Month... <br>To: support@anarchy-online.com <br>CC: marketing@funcom.com <br>         <br> <br><br><br>To Support:<br><br>1. Apartment Bug: Cannot access apartment. Have key in<br>inventory, but zoning sequence will not initiate.<br><br>2. Hotkey: I cannot find any information in the box<br>manual or on AO community sites regarding how to<br>Hotkey<br>commands, such as for my Opifex Agent. I want to be<br>able to access in the Action Screen a button for the<br>use of Martial Arts in combat mode. I currently have<br>Fire, Aimed Shot, Brawl, Riposte, Dimach, and the<br>other basic commands. I've been maxing-out Martial<br>Arts<br>with IP's because several player forums have suggested<br>that Martial Arts should be the primary form of hand<br>to hand combat. Question: Is the Brawl Button what I<br>would use to initiate Martial Arts in combat? When I<br>click Brawl, my Agent begins punching the oponent but<br>no use of kicks, while my NPC oponent has full use of<br>kicking and punching. So, specifically, how do I<br>Hotkey<br>Martial Arts into my Action Window or onto the<br>keyboard?<br><br>3. Action Window:  Since my first day of gameplay<br>buttons in my Action Window have been randomly<br>disappearing and reappearing. Now I understand that<br>when I equip a weapon or item the icon for it will<br>appear in the Action Screen, but WHY after stacking<br>certain buttons does my predefined sequence go into<br>disaray? <br><br>4. Free Month: Obviously it's expected that an MMORPG<br>in it's infancy stages is going to have bugs and<br>performance issues. I'm 38 years old and am an avid<br>MMORPG'er, so I understand that the best way to test a<br>game for bugs & performance issues is to have<br>thousands<br>of players filling the servers.  But, one day after I<br>registered it was announced that AO's first free month<br>would go into effect because the developers felt that<br>the game was now playable. Yes, it is true that I can<br>roam the Omni-Tek Training Ground and engage in<br>combat.<br>I was able to go from level 1 to 5 in two days, and<br>have raised my skill points adaquately and have<br>accumulated over a thousand credits. But, that's about<br>it. Though I was able to accomplish an easy mission in<br>Highrise 12, when I attempted to zone out of the<br>newbie area and into the big city of Omni-1, I was<br>plagued with extremely-slow framerates, zoning crashes<br>to my desktop, impossible to implement nano programs,<br>extremely-slow implementation of action buttons to the<br>point that the game would become completely<br>unplayable.<br>I had to go back to the newbie zone because outside of<br>the newbie zone was ABSOLUTELY-UNPLAYABLE! NOTHING<br>FUNCTIONS AT ALL OUTSIDE OF THE NEWBIE ZONE! So, with<br>that said, I do NOT believe that Funcom should be<br>implementing the Free Month at this stage in the games<br>development! This is NOT fair to the AO gaming<br>community, since you are very simply using us as<br>PAYING<br>GUNEA PIGS to BETA-TEST YOUR UNFINISHED GAME.  I'm<br>stating FOR THE RECORD that if performance outside of<br>the newbie zone continues to be unmanageble for the<br>next 3 weeks, then I will have NO CHOICE in regard to<br>cancelling my subscription until I read a CREDIBLE AO<br>REVIEW at a Review Site such as GAMESPOT.COM stating<br>that AO is playable/definitely worth paying a monthly<br>subscription rate for. How you could POSSIBLY consider<br>AO playable at this stage so soon after LAUNCH is<br>something of an EXTREME mystery to me. But, I suppose<br>that is the nature of MMORPG's these days. Online<br>gaming is still in it's infancy stages and I would<br>expect that within the next couple of years<br>development companies will start to realize that<br>releasing unfinished buggy games will NOT attract<br>positive sentiment from the gaming community,<br>especially when we have to pay for the privelege of<br>BETA-TESTING your games :) Nothing personal friends.<br>This is just my opinion. Aside from the performance<br>issues and my disinterest in paying past the free<br>month<br>for an obviously unplayable game at this early stage,<br>the graphics are very nice considering TLJ engine you<br>implemented, and being an avid Adventure/Roleplayer<br>it's not difficult to see that AO has GREAT POTENTIAL<br>to be an outstanding game. <br><br>              Thanks for your time. I will be eagerly<br>awaiting your response :)<br><br>My PC Tech Specs: PIII/500MHz - 128 RAM - nVidia<br>TNT(version 1)graphics card - SoundBlaster X-Gamer - I<br>defrag my Hard Drive and run RAM<br>Recovery(MemTurboII)tool to recover up to 45M of RAM<br>before login to servers. I do not run (MemTurbo)<br>during gameplay. After attempting to zone outside of<br>the newbie area into Omni-1 I was forced to go back to<br>newbie area, log-out, and when I ran (MemTurbo to<br>recover up to 45M,<br>I was able to recover 95M...which further suggests to<br>me that there is DEFINITELY RAM LEAKAGE in-game. <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've been having quite a bit of trouble getting this game to work on my PIII/500 system w/128 RAM & nvidia TNT. I think AO is frying my system because prior to installation, my pc's X-GAMER soundcard and Altec Lansing 880 speakers provided pretty good sound. But after playing AO for a week,<br>the sound quality has diminished greatly. Now it sounds as though my soundcard has been dragged across granite, torched, doused in acid, and sun-dried. Perhaps it's time for an upgrade. But I'd hate to think that my computer needs to be upgraded because AO fried the syetem. The game is almost completely-unplayable, even with my newly-installed T1 internet line. Granted, it's better than dial-up, but not by much. <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I tried to Log-In to the Account page, not specifically to cancel just yet, but to see what procedure was involved in cancelling the account.<br>Every effort I made to Log-In was immediately thwarted with a "Log-In Error!" message stating that my Username and Password were unacceptable. Yet, with the same Username and Password I was able to Log-In to the servers on countless occasions, including immediatly before and after attempting to Log-In to the Account page. Interpret this as you will. To be honest, I don't really want to cancel my account. Because when the game works, which in my case happens VERY infrequently, AO actually IS quite fun. When I called EBX in Santa Monica, a staff acquaintance who is a self-proclaimed EQ fanatic, fellow adventurer, and local EQ expert told me when I inquired about EB's policy on exchanging AO, he told me that it's considered "normal" in the MMORPG community for a game such as AO to be released with SO many bugs and performance issues.<br>He had been playing EQ since Launch Day and stated that the problems AO is having now are NOTHING compared to the issues EverQuest had the first 3 months after release. He suggested that if I truly like the game & think it has potential and am hesitant on returning it now, then I should keep it and be patient for a couple of months. He said that's about how long it took EverQuest to get to the point where it was playable. And believe me this guy is a VERY serious EQ'er. He has an impressive playing style and has made tons of EQ friends in his guilds and has developed an impressive line of characters. I currently have 16 interesting EQ characters that I was VERY much in the process of developing on Antonica, Kunark, and Velious, but have placed their development on hold for a time, while I explore Anarchy Online. I'm not entirely displeased with AO, simply because I see SO MUCH potential. Granted, the graphics are nice but could be better. And the sound could be better, considering my X-Gamer soundcard and Altec Lansing 880 speakers with subwoofer. I guess Ragnar Torquist & Tommy Strand thought that utilizing the graphics engine, from THE LONGEST JOURNEY, would allow them to incorporate a massive fantasy world with many possibilities for vehicular travel and teleportation between many huge zones, and would enable players not to have to use a High-End Gaming Rig to play this game. But, quite the contrary, what I read recently and you can take it for whatever it's worth players should be aware that you WILL need no less than a high-end system such as a P4/1.5GHz with a minimum of 256 RAM, and a Gforce card to get the game to a state where it's even playable. Don't quote me word for word on that, but from what I've experienced on my PIII/500, 128 RAM, TNT, SoundBlaster, 56K V.90 system is that AO is NOT playable now, nor does it "look" as though it will be in the near future. Things could always change, though. I'd been looking around for a new high-end system at Falcon-nw, Voodoopc...& Alienware recently and am having a 1.5M/128Kb DSL line installed in a few days, but for the time being I'm suffering through ALL the frustrations & heartache that everyone else is. So Do I return the game or keep it? Hmmm...Don't know, yet. But Electronics Boutique gave me the ultimatum: "Return it now", or as Donnie Brasco says, "FOGETTABOUT IT" :)  <br>      <br>             "Food For Thought"<br><br>      I may or may not keep this game. I'm thinking that I could return AO, go back to playing EQ, and wait until AO is playable and worth shelling out thirteen bucks a month for. Yet, on the other hand, I've already created two AO characters that are pretty cool and I'd like to create other class/professions to see the differences in playing-style. It's pretty cool having the ability to create an infinite number of characters as either Omni...Neutral...or Clan affiliate, to explore the world with. What would be REALLY cool is if instead of ending the conflict in four years, which if I'm not mistaken is the developer's plan to end the game permanently, if they did what Lucas Arts is doing with Star Wars: Galaxies by creating the ability for galactic interplanetary travel, that would be enough to keep me GLUED to this game four the next four years and endure whatever problems are going to plague AO in the coming months...& uhhhh (Years?).<br><br>    Espiria        Fazzel          Mathazar<br>    Level 6        Level 1         Level 1<br>    Opifex Agent   Atrox Enforcer  Nano Nano-Tech<br>    Omni-Tek       Neutral         Clans<br><br>                       <br>             <br>                    <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2> As far as I'm concerned, this game is completely unplayable and I have already cancelled my account. Now I can go back to devoting PRECIOUS gaming time to EverQuest! I played before cancelling last night: (7-17-01) and the newbie zones were SO playable, that I thought they had finally fixed the game. So I ventured into the City of Omni-1. Wow, what a mistake! It took me two nights of camping just to get to the other side of the city so that I could zone to another area and go explore the countryside. Granted, once you get out of the city, it's a little better, but not by very much. AO is showing marked improvements everyday, but NOT enough to keep this gamer glued to the screen for hours & hours every night. My account IS cancelled. Read Review at Gamespot. AO is going back to EB today.  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Considering that AO was following in the Very Large footsteps of EQ and had the opportunity of learning from their mistakes,  I don't understand how FUNCOM could make such a HUGE marketing blunder by releasing this LAME DUCK of a game.  Though I did create a few characters, It wasn't because the game was SO good and playable.  I created all these characters with the idea that I'd be spending the next few months in the newbie arear because the game was for the most part completely unplayable outside of the newbie zone.  And though I did cancel my account and returned the game back to Electronics Boutique,  I would consider repurchasing it if the problems were for the most part solved,  and the game was playable.  I don't particularly want to lose the characters I've created and I do still believe the game has huge potential.  Unfortunately,  by the time AO IS playable,  there will be a whole slew of new games available for the Xbox and PS2 consoles along with some exciting new PC games.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
