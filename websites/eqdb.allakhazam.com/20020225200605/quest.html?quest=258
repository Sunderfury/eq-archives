There are 3 NPC's standing along ice wall near Starn bearjumpers place. Talk with the human wizard Sulgar and he will tell you that he is looking for tartons wheel.  (you must have good faction with beta neutral to get this quest).  He gives you a glowing case and a tome of hints that spans all over the 3 continents. The case is to hold the spokes of the wheel and the tome gives you hints on where to find the pieces.  Be aware that the case is a no rent item and will disappear when you log out, so don't put any rods in it until you are ready to give them to Sulgar.  You combine the pieces you find in the box and get The Staff of the Wheel (a 1HB weapon) and the star of eyes (a gem which casts unlimited identify spells).  When you give them to him, he will give you the runes of frost and astral needed to research the ice comet spell.  (Then pray your research doesn't fail).   There are 10 pieces that you need scattered across the face of<br>Norrath. The names of the 10 rods are: Azia, Beza, Caza, Dena, Ena, Fana, Geza, Heda, Izah, Jaka. They are just called "a rod", and identify as wizard only. <br>The locations are as follows:<br>(1) [azia] On the ocean floor in Eruds Crossing past the zombie boat where the zombie sailors hang out.  (location - neg 1162, pos 2340);<br><br>(2) [beza]  In the underwater cave in the Everfrost plains.  It is in the "house" all the way back and right in the cave, where 3 dry bones guard it in the center of the room; <br><br>(3) [caza] Lake Rath.  Underneath the first island you see is an underwater tunnel leading to a stone tower.  Its on the top floor of the tower. (You need enduring breath<br>for this one);<br><br>(4) [Dena] Dagnor's cauldron, right outside the entrance to Kedge Keep.  If you face with your back to Kedge, it is directly diagagonal left, in a corner - or you can swim straight out and down from Unrest;<br><br>(5) [Ena] Lower Guk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is the only one you need a group for, unless you're brave and kamakazi it. Warning, the floor is the same color as the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find with the hand and the dar beating on you;<br><br>(6) [Fana] Oasis of Marr in the underwater tower next to the above ground tower, on the top floor;<br><br>(7) [Geza] Highhold Pass in the water near the waterfall closest to the Tiger Inn. There are 2 waterfalls there.  The rod is in front of the one closest to the inn;<br><br>(8)  [Heda] Qeynos Aqueducts, in the shark pit;<br><br>(9) [Izah] Neriak in the water in front of<br>the bar called "the blind fish".  The bar has 4 glass windows that are underwater, and the rod spawns right in front of those windows; <br><br>(10)  [Jaka] Unrest in the water outside the right side of the house near where the the gnome speulunker is.  Instead of going into the tunnel that leads to him, you go a little right of that entrance and there's a very short passage where you can find the rod. </td></tr>

However, when I did the quest, I simply sat at the zone and asked in OOC if anyone would be willing to kill the hand for me if it wasn't camped. A 50+ necro offered to do so, I then went in and picked up the rod. He even let me loot the Serpentine Bracer from the hand. Many people in LGuk are camping boring... slow spawns. You shouldn't have too much trouble finding someone to help you get this one. Beyond that, I didn't have to fight or kill anything for this quest, and it took me about 2 hours to complete.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I did this quest at lvl 17 with my wiz, and just finished. Pretty sure it can be done solo except for guk and maybe EF. I had a druid friend there for ports when I did most of em, all he ever cast on me was lev and breath, thats why I think most of it can be solo at my lvl. In qaynos, I went in at the rouges guild, and just fell down the pit into the chark pool, the 2 mobs outside the pool were non-aggro. Did get dog form for lake rath, deep was there, and me bein lvl 17, I didn't mess around, forget the loc of the tunnle opening, its the island with deep, cause you'll prolly get to see her if you get the rod. You don't need breath for oasis, I used invis. Look thru these posts, you'll find a loc for the one in dagnor's. Unrest was a bit trick, if you had vis vs undead it would be cake, I caused a small train cause the undead in the water aggro me, then I ran back befor they walked back to thier spawn points and grabed the rod, if you stand with your back to the gazebo and right next to the water and the zone wall, you can jump in, turn aound, and the ledge with the rod is right in frount of you. Lguk was without a doubt that hardest one, not at all posable solo, had a group of around 35 with me when I tried, that didn't work, but they had friends, so I got to watch 3 lvl 60's ( war, wizzy, and chanter )with thier epics clear everything from the safehall to the ghoul lord in about 5 mins with no brake, that was the hand and mage spawns to, pullin mobs about 20 at a time, no exageration ( the wizzys al kabor aoe whiped em out in about 3 casts ). EF was last cause thats were ya turn the stuff in, got breath and vis vs undead, ran in grabed the rod, and waved at the lich on my way out. Thats how I did it, hope it helps ya some.<br><br>Lamder Icestyyker<br>48 Warrior<br>Burnsalot<br>17 Wizzy<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This post is in response to the LUCKY wizards who looted rods (3) [Caza] from Lake Rathe and (6)[Fana] from Oasis with ONLY invisible and NOT WOLF FORM.<br>I did my homework regarding the Staff of the Wheel Quest and the comments to use wolf form and not were 50-50. Initially when I arrived in Oasis, I intended to follow the safer path and find a 39+ Druid to cast wolf form on me. <br>I shouted in OOC for hours with no avail; nonetheless, I bumped into several wizards who assured me enduring breath and invisible will do the trick.<br>So, I drank my enduring breath potion, cast invisible and off to the underwater tower I go! But this was not a happy ending... The underwater tower consists of 35+ Goblin Casters who SEE THROUGH INVISIBLE. When I reached the second story with rod in sight, several goblins chased me as I swam to the shore in desperation. I died of course but even worse... The goblins that chased me trained everybody on land! When I returned to my bind spot in Oasis I died 3 more times as I attempted to loot my corpse because the goblins would not return to their spawn spot underwater!In addition, I think these goblins are underconned. The only way to really know is to see for yourself.<br>This experience frustrated me SO much, I never considered looting the rod from Lake Rathetear without wolf form. <br>Nonetheless, got the rods and successfully quested for The SotW. If you have any questions and require help on Zeboruxok Server, send me a tell friends.<br><br>Clariel Myndfyre<br>Wizard of 35 Seasons<br>Graysons Few<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok... I started reading up on this quest since I was lvl 10 (9 lvls ago), and I decided to make it an every once in a while thing. Well, I can tell you, I was hunting in Oasis at lvl 16 when I decided since I was there, I might as well grab a rod.<br>I'm sick of people giving tons of wrong info on quests! 1) EB is not nessesary for that rod! It took all of 30 seconds to swim straight down to the top floor, grab the rod, and get the hell out! Jeez, what did you do, stop for some coffee? and 2)I wasn't stupid. I invised myself before going down, and NO ONE SAW ME... I even poked a goblin.<br>I'm still a newbie in the world of EQ, but having searched for guitar tabs for years, I can recognize when people have no clue about something. I'd appreciate it if someone posts some actual, USEFUL advise for finishing this quest. Thanks<br><br>Urzai<br>Lvl 19 Wiz (MM)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>ACCUTALLY....there are diffent classes of gobblins that spawn on top of the tower.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your spawn is caster...THEY SEE THROUGH INVIS!!  My friend (26 wiz) and i (23 wiz) found this out the hard way.  After one death we decided real quick to get help.  We had a 48 Pally go in and clear it out but by the time the 2 were dead and he had healed and buffed me and himself to go back in they had respawned.  Luckly this time they were war. class gobblins who didn't see through invis.  I looted the wand and swam out without any trouble.  I had NO wolf form or even SoW and didn't have enduring breath.<br><br>Anyways, just my 2cps worth.  I am doing this quest slowly just as I go along.  6 rods down and 4 rods to go!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I started this quest a few weeks ago, I was a yellow into 24. I will put this in order as how i did it but leave the numbers the same for a reference in hope that it helps<br><br><br>(7) [Geza] Highhold Pass in the water near the waterfall closest to the Tiger Inn. There are 2 waterfalls there. The rod is in front of the one closest to the inn; <br><br>This is the first one I did just have sow and invis run in jump in the water at the loc and look in the corner there it is. 1 down 9 to go<br><br>(8) [Heda] Qeynos Aqueducts, in the shark pit; <br><br>Number 2 Just invis and run in. You will need a map I entered thru the hidden entrance in North Quenos. Print a map and follow it to the pit. The orge was up when i got there and i just clicked on the rod and picked it up without getting into the water.<br><br><br>(1) [azia] On the ocean floor in Eruds Crossing past the zombie boat where the zombie sailors hang out. (location - neg 1162, pos 2340); <br><br>Number 3 I would suggest getting enduring breath for this one. For when you swim down you get drift away from the loc you started from. I finally found the rod after several attempts then died 1 second from the surface by drowning. One death and a stupid one at that. (3 hour corpse run because i was looking for my corpse on the floor when it was suspended in the water above me and just out of sight)<br><br>(9) [Izah] Neriak in the water in front of <br>the bar called "the blind fish". The bar has 4 glass windows that are underwater, and the rod spawns right in front of those windows; <br><br>Just gated to the closes gate invised ran north to entrance to zone ran in and jumped. Invis ran out but i just hid in a corner in the water recast and went swimming again. One note the windows are under water, i was looking for them above water.<br><br>(3) [caza] Lake Rath. Underneath the first island you see is an underwater tunnel leading to a stone tower. Its on the top floor of the tower. (You need enduring breath <br>for this one); <br><br>This was easy zone in swim strait out to island. when you see the platform with the avicks on them go to the other side of the island and with invis and enduring breath swim in the tunnel. I have seen post that you need wolf form to do this or other parts of this quest or you will fail. Don't listen to that never used wolf form got the rod with no death here.<br><br>(6) [Fana] Oasis of Marr in the underwater tower next to the above ground tower, on the top floor; <br><br>More swimming and alas another invis too, get enduring breath for this one too after my death getting the 3rd rod i did not take any more chances more than nessessary<br><br>(4) [Dena] Dagnor's cauldron, right outside the entrance to Kedge Keep. If you face with your back to Kedge, it is directly diagagonal left, in a corner - or you can swim straight out and down from Unrest; <br><br>I used levate here and went to the the cords and went down looked for it and there it was. Was going to go get the next one but invis ran out on the way up so i zone back to bb ran to the bank and came back to do the next<br><br><br>(10) [Jaka] Unrest in the water outside the right side of the house near where the the gnome speulunker is. Instead of going into the tunnel that leads to him, you go a little right of that entrance and there's a very short passage where you can find the rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Remember to swim up for this one it is on a ledge that while still under water is not down in the deep part. It is hidden in the corner with skellies swimming around as were other stuff. Nothing agro on me I just went in follow the wall to the right till i hit a building that i could not run behind then went around that building giving every mob a wide berth as i did not have invis to undead but did have regular invis then jumped in the water and swam to the cords then gated out on the ledge.<br><br>Then I took a break and went back to lake of ill omen for a 2 weeks and gained 5 lvls and started the last 2 rods 3 yellows into 29. All the ones above this i did with only food and a summoned light source so if i died I did not need to worry about corpse retrival<br><br><br>(2) [beza] In the underwater cave in the Everfrost plains. It is in the "house" all the way back and right in the cave, where 3 dry bones guard it in the center of the room; <br><br>Get enduring breath as this is a long swim to the cave. I did not use invis here and was not agro by anything in the water. once i was above water i cast invis for the bear and hugged the wall to the right until i found the rod hut. I only got agro by a ice bone skellie in the tunnel to hut once and quickly nuked him. The rod is in the hut and the 3 skellies are now all INSIDE the hut. Seeing that i medded up in a corner behind the hut and then went to the front door and slowly moved in and with each step tryed to pick up the rod. Got the rod without any agro from the 3 skellis inside the hut. back out quick ran to edge and gated out 9 down and 1 to go.<br><br><br>(5) [Ena] Lower Guk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is the only one you need a group for, unless you're brave and kamakazi it. Warning, the floor is the same color as the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find with the hand and the dar beating on you; <br><br>I waited a day or two until friday after doing rod 9 for this one I even went to ec and then gated back to ef for mammoth hunting. Well when the hunting got bad i started my long journey to Guk at 9:30pm yesterday a friday. I gated to North ro and with sow and invis a ran all the way south to guk.<br><br>Upper guk was easy and took the same path i saw someone recently posted here via the ancient crocs to the undead side. A bit of warning when you zone in to lower via the water this route you will be under water. do not freak out like i did and just swim forward. It not a long swim so you do not need enduring breath. I got to a ledge by the bedroom and someone that was running from the lower side live pulled an undead and died ( i know cause i saw his corpse later when i started swiming again) once he was dead the ghoul came and pounded me to death (2nd death). got a rivive from someone in the bedroom and poof i was back binded myself on the same spot after looting my corpse and waited until the bedroom was under control went to the bedroom got a invis to undead ran down the hall past the ice bones (greater) and jumped down to the lower part (just past the icebone you come to a room go to the left and jump, yes take the damage for me it was 45hp)<br>then head north watch out for the pits stay in the center. i saw a post on another site that said stay out of the center i did and fell into the pit. But all is not lost after deciding not to gate back and seeing no undead down there which was good cause the invis to undead had wore off now i found a ladder and climbed back up. try to continue north and saw an aminated hand cast a spell and knew i was close saw another undead north of me did a loc and relized that the pit had taken me north of the hand room so moved back south and found hand passage bound my self right before the hand room and while the spell was being cast the hand and undead mob was pulled out not good. was able to focus enough to finish the bind and was bound right where i was going to die. At first i thought great i was going to be in a death loop but the puller pulled the 2 mobs out or the hall and when i came back i had an empty hand room ran to room swam up ran around found rod picked it up ran back into water ran to courpse looted and gated out woo woo woo woo <br><br>Forgive a spelling errors. Some notes use invis everywhere have sow and get enduring breath whenever you go into the water the extra time will reduce the stress of finding the rods if you don't have to worry about breathing. I did the first 8 naked the last 2 fully dressed. I never had wolf form and i bound myself on dry land at almost every site after the eurdin crossing death<br><br>My only question now is how do i use the Star of Eyes<br> <br><br>&nbsp;<br>Burlarr<br>Wizard 51st Season<br>Mr Nipanch<br>Pally 17th<br>Aueaddar<br>Enc 9th<br>Caeppun<br>Druid 8th</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just finished this quest yesterday after putting time into it off and on for 15 lvls.&nbsp;&nbsp;This quest is relatively not hard considering you really don't have to kill anything if you don't want to.  It just takes some time, patience, and sometimes a couple of corpse runs, hehe.  I recommend printing the quest out from www.graffe.com.  This printout helped me considerably.  These are my experiences with the different rod pieces and some of my observations:<br><br>Erud's Crossing: The rod is located at loc neg1162, pos2340.  Just to the right of the front of the ship, just off of the deep end.  I levved out to just before the loc and dove down to find it right in front of me.  The killer sharks mentioned earlier in these posts weren't there for me nor my friend.  However, I would recommend invis just in case this was a fluke, hehe.  Also, you really don't need enduring breath unless your swimming skill sux (you will get a chance to get that skill up considerably with this quest, Lol).  With a skill of 126 I was able to go down and search for a few secs before having to come back up.<br><br>Everfrost Caves:  I did this one last because it was close to Sulgar.  The entrance to the underwater cave is at pos2420 neg4060.  You WILL need enduring breath (EB) for this one.  I just bought an EB potion in Halas and dove in.  A word of caution here, there is no light in this cave.  It is extremely hard to see so have something that will get you to see well in here (if you're an Erudite like me, it's a necessity).  If you swim North, you will eventually hit land.  Just stay right the whole time and you'll get to the house.  I walked in and grabbed the rod.  Only one of three ice-boned skellies aggroed (green to 29).  I rooted and nuked the skellie and Gated.  I never saw the Lich that spawns in here.<br><br>Lake Rathe:  You need EB and wolf-form for this one.  Wolf form is the only way to ensure the DW Gobbies won't aggro.  It is a long, dark swim to the tower.  It is on the top floor of the tower.  With wolf form, all the gobbos were indiff and I grabbed the rod and gated.  To find the cave just swim directly out from the dock as you zone in from SK.<br><br>Dagnor's Cauldron: It's loc is neg890, neg740.  From the Unrest entrance, just swim straight out and a little to the right.  You don't need EB for this one, but invis is a must because of the Gobbos swimming around down there.<br><br>Lower Guk: AHHHHHHHH!!!!! Talk about frustrating for a lower lvl to get, Lol.  Ok, face it, you will die on this one unless you are really lucky and have a couple of great escorts.  Luckily for me I only died once.  Just make sure you have an exp buffer for this one and expect to die a couple of times :).  I was lucky enough to have a kick-ass chanter to escort me to the Hand room and mezz them while I grabbed the rod (Thanks again Yizenu!!!!).  I zoned in and offered to donate for an escort.<br><br>Oasis:  EB and wolf form again because of DW Gobbos.  Underwater tower again and again on the top floor.  The tower is east of the Specter tower right next to it.  Just swim in and grab it.<br><br>Highpass Hold:  This is the easiest one to get unless you're a darkie, which then you're going to have to invis the whole way there.  It's right next to the Tiger's Roar Inn at the base of the closest waterfall to the Inn.  Even a lvl 1 with no swimming exp can get this one, Lol.<br><br>Qeynos Aquaducts:  Go in the Queen Klicnik entrance and go into the sewers.  You are going to need a map for this one unless you want to search for hours on end, hehe.  Everything in the aquaducts conned green to me at 27, including Riggin Vix, but I invised anyways and nothing aggroed including the sharks.  I did have to get in the water to pick up the rod unlike someone said earlier where you didn't have to.<br><br>Neriak: I made a mule darkie to scope out my route for this one being I am of the lighter persuasion hehe.  There are plenty of safe zones to re-invis here so don't worry about this one really.  Just run in invis and jump in the water off of the small cliff as soon as you zone into the commons and swim over to the windows of the Blind Fish and grab it.  Be advised though that was some other bag in front of the window also.  It might have been coincidence, but the one you want is the orange rod looking one, hehe, it looks like all of the other rods.<br><br>Unrest: Located in the underwater tunnel just passed the gazebo.  When you enter the tunnel, look for a passage above you, it is up there.  There are zombies that swim in there (all green to a lvl 23), so watch for them.<br><br>So there you go, I hope this helps you in any way possible, and if you have any questions, send a tell to me if you're on the Zeb server :) and I'll answer any questions you might have regarding this quest if I can.  Thanks again to Azal, Atlanka, and Kireina for the help with the different pieces ;).<br>&nbsp;<br>Raiestlyn Wrathcaster<br>Fates Messengers<br>Zeb Server</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just finished this quest with my Level 10 wizard, with some help from a friendly 12 Enchanter.&nbsp;&nbsp;This quest can be done at this level if you have someone willing to give you invisibility and enduring breath from time to time, and you don't mind asking for help in Lower Guk. I bought some Invis. Vs. Undead potions that were (literally) a life-saver in some parts of the quest.  Even with these, and buffs from the Enchanter, I still died half a dozen times and lost a level.  So, be sure you start the quest with a cushion of experience so that you don't drop a level when you get killed a few time (which you almost inevitably will).  Get more potions (Invis.vs.Undead) than you think you will need, as they don't last as long as you might think. Be patient and take your time.  It took me most of a week, several hours a night, but it is satisfying to complete the quest and get the Staff.<br><br>So, here are a few tips that I can offer. If I had known these things (or read the posts here more thoroughly before I started) I might have died less times.<br><br>Erud's crossing: Stay well north of the ship so that the zombie sailors don't get you. Get enduring breath for this one - it is fairly deep. Also, use invis here to help avoid the sharks. I grabbed and gated, contrary to other advice given here.<br><br>Everfrost Caves: Go north under the ice in the river.  You can't miss the caves if you just continue north.  I wasted quite a bit of time searching the river bed near the ice hole for the entrance to the caves. Just go north past the ice goblins and into the cave. They will con green and will leave you alone.  Be sure to follow the RIGHT wall around to find the house containing the rod.  I went left and wandered lost in the caverns until getting killed by Lich.  When you follow the RIGHT wall and get to the hut/house, use an invis vs. Undead potion and you won't have to fight the skels for the rod.  Just grab it, get away from the house and gate outta there.<br><br>Lake Rathe: This one requires enduring breath. Invis is a good idea too.  I found I was able to loot the rod through the window, while staying out of the sight/aggro zone of the MoBs inside.  Stay to the left side of the window and try to just peek inside and grab the rod.  It took several tries, but I got it this way.  Move away from the tower a little and gate out.<br><br>Dagnor's: Enduring breath is a must here.  Invis is a good idea, as there are a lot of aqua goblins and other creatures that would just love to pound on you if you are lower level as I was.<br><br>Lower Guk: Just face the fact that you will need help for this one unless you are already a high level. I was able to make my way to LGuk on my own, as I was only dubious to the Frogloks. (Thank goodness I have never killed a Froggie.)  I told everyone in the zone my story (/ooc) and asked nicely for an escort to the hand room and help clearing it.  A nice 54 Monk (I think) and 52 Cleric got me there (with only one death), cleared the room, and refused my offer to pay them something for their trouble.<br><br>Oasis:  This one was easy with enduring breath and invis.  Just swim in invisible and grab the rod. No sweat.<br><br>Highpass:  This one was easy too.  I swam in with enduring breath and invisibility, but probably could have done without either one or both.<br><br>Qeynos: This is a breeze with invisibility. Jump in, grab and jump out.  Other posters on this site have said they had to kill one of the characters standing by the pit in order to get the rod to spawn.  I had no such trouble.  The rod was sitting there when I arrived.  Had to get in the water to see it, though.<br><br>Neriak: This one was not a problem either.  The guards in Neriak conned unfriendly, but invisibility handled that.  Then, I swam in to get the rod and had no problems.  Some say you can loot through the window of the "Blind Fish," but I didn't want to take a chance by being in there and having my invis fail.<br><br>Unrest:  Here is another case where Invis.vs.Undead is needed. Follow the directions given elsewhere on this board to find the rod.  Then CARRY it out.  I tried to gate and was immediately smashed by the nearby undead MoBs because (of course) my invis broke when I started to cast.<br><br>If you go to Sulgay (loc pos 3000, neg 2400) and try to talk to him, be aware that he talks about [Tarton's wheel], but you MUST ask about "Tarton wheel" (singular, not possessive).  I wasted quite a bit of time trying to ask about "Tarton's wheel."  That just doesn't work.  Better still, just walk up to him and ask about the wheel case.  That is much easier.<br><br>Lower level Wizard take heart - you CAN do this quest early in your life, as long as you don't mind the thought of dying a few times.  Just take your time and do your homework.  Parts of the quest are VERY nerve wracking, but can be done.  And I enjoyed seeing many parts of Norrath that I had never been to before.<br><br>Enjoy the quest and enjoy the staff when you get it. <br><br>Niaden<br>10 Wizard <br>Karana<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As a 42 wiz I did this quest in about 4 hours with only one death. I looked at many websites and pc posts before starting so I had lots of info to start with. This is what I found out during the quest:<br>1. No sharks spawned in Erud's xing. If you lev to the loc and dive down invis should be no problem. There are a couple of zombies near the ship but they won't bother if you are at correct loc. -1160 +2340<br>2. EF rod was a cinch. +2420 -4060<br>3. LR was a little stressful. Definitely need enduring breath or DMF. I swam down once to scope it out and lost all my stamina so didn't loot until second trip in. Some of the dwgobs saw invis and some didn't. I stayed close to the ceiling and floated down just close enough to grab the rod and swim away.<br>4. In DC you may want invis to undead as low lvl skellies are just annoying but loc is correct. -890 -740<br>5. LG is tough. I went on a weekend when the whole dungeon was camped so aggros were less likely. I used invis and invis to undead interchangeably (got a nec friend to help with that). When you get the Hand room you actually have to swim up.<br>6. Oasis has dwgobs also. Some saw invis so similar approach was used like in LR. I forget to get an loc but the tower is near the shore close to the inn. These guys are tough. They cast so if you aggro them prepare to run or gate.<br>7. HPH was really easy. I just invised, swam down and got it right below the waterfall.<br>8. The aqueducts in Qeunos was the only "tricky" one. I arrived and there were two npcs. Riggin Vix and Timvu. Timvu kept picking something up but I couldn't see what it was. There was no rod in the shark pit so I decided to kill the two npcs. Blue and green to me. When I killed them an ogre popped and the rod appeared in the shark pit. Invis worked fine for picking it up. So apparently Timvu is picking up the rod when he pops so you have to kill the greedy guy.<br>9. Nek was easy. I am DE =) Not sure how to do this if you aren't. I guess you could zone in and jump off the bridge or go to the Blind Fish and loot it through the window upstairs. That's how I did it.<br>10. Unrest is easy but get invis to undead and stick to right wall when you get in. Jump in the stream and the rod is actually up on a little platform in the stream. Loc is +520 -285<br><br>The stats on the staff are really great (10 int/hp/mana and wt 1 stone)and a death or two is worth it in my opinion until the epic quest. Also, if you turn in the Star of Eyes that Sulgar gives you you get exp. I got 2 blue bubs at 42 so it's nothing to scoff at. You get the no drop rune of the astral as well. Feel free to give me a tell if you play on Terris Thule server.<br>~Aelrye Manastorm~<br>42 Wizard<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just did this quest, and it took me 2 nights to accomplish and I was lvl 23. Here is how I did it. <br><br>1. Oasis, Towers easy to find, just swim into the top floor with invis, grab it, swim out. It doesn't seem to stop invis.<br><br>2. Neriak, I am a Dark Elf so this was easy. Just swam in, and grabbed it. Easy.<br><br>3. Unrest, Ported over to GFay and had no problems getting to the moat. Took a few minutes to grab it, but it was safe. <br><br>4. Dagnor's cauldron, Just swam out straight from Unrest and foundit no problem.<br><br>5. Erud's crossing, Ported to tox and went on the boat. Went to the ship wreck and started to swim around looking for it. I was attacked and quickly slain by a Shark. It hit consistently for 95s. I came back, got my corpse, and kept invis up this time. Found it after searching for a bit. Death count 1.<br><br>6. Qeynos, From Erud's crossing went to Qeynos, took the underwater entrance, and followed my map the shark pit. Went in Invis and had no problems. <br><br>7. Lake Rathe, gated to N. Karana and went south to the lake. Found the entrance, got enduring breath, went in invis. Swam to the tower, looted the wand, swam out. Here is a tip, If invis wears out, swim to the top corners of the cave, and recast. You should be far enough away to not aggro.<br><br>8. Lower Guk. Brought an sk friend with me. We got an escort down to lower guk, we made it as far as the bed room before a bat aggro'd us, and we were swarmed. Death count 2. I found a different way to lower guk, and came in above the waterfall. I recomend this route. My sk friend was able to wait there in saftey, invis vs undead. The river winds all the way down to the bedroom, so corpse retreaval was easy. I left my body at the bottom of the waterfall, since I knew I was safe. I then got IVU'd, and found my way to the Hand room. Jumped up in, and was killed. Death count 3. I now knew the way, and the layout of the room. I ran down again, got aggro'd by a bat, and swarmed. Death count 4. I tried again, lured the hand into the water some how, grabbed the wand with the ghoul beating on me, and was luckily able to get my gate off. Went back in, collected my friend and my corpse, and got the hell out of there.<br><br>9. High Hold. Gated to N. Karana, ran to HH, Invis'd, got the wand with no difficulty, and gated back to N. Karana.<br><br>10. Everfrost. My first time in the zone, found out where the cave was, got enduring breath because I thought the caves would all be under water. This is the only wand above the surface. Before I went in, I got the bag, swam in, and cleared out the skele hut with no trouble. I gave a warning to the zone to stay out of the caves in case the lich spawns, and grabbed it and gated out. <br><br>I am now the proud owner of the staff, and had a death count of 4. It could definatly have been less, but I was inexperienced in those 2 zones. If there is a next time it will go much smoother.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Thank you for the advice, but I am still stuck. =(<br><br>I have gotten all of the rods, but Sulgar still won't give me the wheel case. <br><br>I know that I am saying the right keywords, because I recruited about five other players to come to Sulgar. I told them word for word what to say, and they all got the case. Here's what we used:<br><br>what tarton wheel<br><br>I am interested<br><br>give me the wheel case<br><br>So, I figured it was my Beta Neutral faction. I went to High Pass Hold and did the bloodstone quest to get those gloves from the Erudite. I did it many many times, but I noticed, that while it would give me experience, I was not getting any Beta Nuetral faction messages, or any other faction boosts for that matter.<br><br>Thinking that maybe they'd changed his faction, I got mine up with the Order of Three in Qenyos ( its' the closest wizard guild to Sulgar ) but still no luck. Oh, well. Gotta try something.<br><br>Finally, some people telling me that I had to petition a GM to reset my Beta Nuetral faction. I petitioned, and was instructed to Email customer support. Customer support told me that the quest was not broken, and that Beta Neutral faction was still in the game.<br><br>So, that's where I stand. 10 rods, but no wheel case. hehe<br><br>Anyway, if anyone knows any way for me to boost my Beta Nuetral faction and get in good with Sulgar, could you please let me know? I have tried the bloodstone one, but it did not work. There are two other ones listed on the Allakazam website, but I am not high enough level to do those yet.<br><br>Any advice would be HUGELY appreciated. <br><br>The next thing I am going to try is to improve my faction with the Barbarians. The guards still regard me dubiously, although I have my doubts that this is connected to Sulgar, as he regards me indifferently.<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Azlin, <br>Level 23 wizard cause I died so much in Lower Guk getting the last rod, hehe<br>Bertox<br><br>Man, I wish I knew what I did that screwed up my faction with Sulgar.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
