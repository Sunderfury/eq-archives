	   <tr><td colspan=2>.......Yep, I do think it is GREAT for darkelves, am I crazy? No. I have my own opinions... For one you earn wood/high-elf faction...though your own race may hate you after a while the elves will remain a reliable source... Still think I'm crazy?? Then READ------&gt; I am not crazy, the orcs con: Looks your way apprehensively -- ***** **** *** ***** **** *** ***** ****, so you can feel save, DVinn wont attack you for a LONG time aswell, even when the orcs scowl at you Ready to attack. I have it so that DVinn glares at me threateningly, I cannot possibly get any worse faction with the CB orcs, the elves.......you don't wanna read, but if you truly thinks you won't shiver then read down ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt; Regards me indifferently... seems average huh??? ok then listen to this, I went through this process: Scowls at me ready to attack, glares at me threateningly, glowers at me dubiosly, looks my way apprehensively, *what it currently is for me*.... lets stop talking about what I accomplished in more than 1000 kills or so, lets talk about what you CAN accomplish and how easy it is... I reccomend this. Start fighting there at level 11. Get in a group and fight at bridge 1, in a group with a tank a caster and a healer(you).  When you get to level 12 get in a FULL group with about 2 tanks 2 healers and 2 misc. in the throne roon, fight there till level 14 then go and get healing. Then get a person to buy you your spell, First get Healing, then Bind affinity, then get smite, then get symbol of transal, then get whatever you please, atleast that is what I reccomend. Then fight at Slaver cave, get keys 18 and 19 and free woodelven slaves to get merchant faction. Then do whatever you please in this zone till level 16 then do you might wanna fo what I'm gonna do when I get 16 go to Lake of Ill Omen, and that is how to get from... but I am only level 14, good luck!!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Jump across the ramp and into the secret area.  No orcs spawn up here, and it is very high in the air. Great medding spot, and if you have enough wizards you can snare and DD a monster in the lego tents or Orc town to death.  Orcs can get up here, but only if you pull them, and even then it takes them about 1-2 minutes to get there, and when things get tough, you can jump into the river.<br><br> 11th season Shaman, Alexandraake<br>Fennin Ro<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I've read all of the posts on tactics for this zone and they all seem very well thought out and accurate, so I won't add to them here.<br><br>However, I didn't see mentioned my favorite safe spot for medding/healing, so I'll post it for everyone to use.<br><br>As you come out of the tunnel, and slightly to the right, you'll see the hill that the trainer is on. To get there you must jump onto the ledge on the left then (depending on race) jump again to the next higher ledge.  Once on this second ledge, put your back to the wall and sit down to med.<br><br>I do this between battles when soloing crushbone.  Nothing wanders past here unless it's running from Trainer hill or chasing someone who's training from the hill.  Should this happen and you're outclassed, the zone is only a few short steps away.  <br><br>The bonus of this spot is that you get to watch the trains run past, to the zone, and then you get to see them all wander back.  The vantage point is great for conning mobs between 6 (when I started here) and 9, and you can pick & choose your battleground(s).<br><br>All in all, a great spot for lower levels who just want the pawns, or low teens who just need a safe location to med/head/get-drunk<br><br>Hope this helps, and Flame on if you wish.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>For the past few days, I have been hunting in CB. Usually with groups in the castle. One day I was chasing down Lord Darish with my group. With 2 legos following me I fell out the window. Laughing, I shrugged it off and went back inside, but it hit me, what happened to the 2 legos following me? A few minutes later, we were suddenly attack by D'Vinn. Unfortunately, he set his on me. After panicking for a minute, I realized I needed a safe way to escape, so, I jumped out the window. D'Vinn wasn't behind me, but I still ran for my life. Since I had SoW I looked behind me. He wasn't there.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The name of the game in CB is faction.  You can go in this zone apprehensive to the Kelethin guards, and come out Warmly, or even Amiably.  You also gain faction with the Storm Guard, which is the BB guard faction, I believe.<br><br>I'd say the best strategy for CB is working your way from left to right in the zone.  When you first enter, you can fight a few cents and the odd pawn still in the cave, as well as about 6 or 7 cents/pawns just outside.  To the left, past the moat running through the zone, is a good place to camp out and kill slavers.  The lego tents at the back of the zone are good for a while, but watch out for blind spots.  <br><br>Trainer hill is a good place to fight, with the Trainer and his 6 cents.  The Trainer sometimes drops the SBS, which is a pretty good shield for most players that are in the zone.<br><br>Further right, there's a long wall separating the castle area from the slave pits.  Be careful at the slave pits.  Two or three slavers spawn there, with a Taskmaster sometimes showing up.  The most important thing to watch out for, and I haven't seen this mentioned yet, is Retlon Brenclog.  He's a Gnome caster, and he hangs out with a pet.  He spawns in a pit just out of view until you actually enter the center camp, but will quickly leave that pit if he goes aggro.  He may not seem high level (he's been blue to me since 16 or 17), but he packs quite a magical punch, and his pet can really tear it up.  I mention Retlon not only because he's a strong enemy, but also because he'll ruin your faction in Steamfont and Ak'Anon, which you may not want to do.  To play it safe, sneak up to him and give him key number 15 (I believe that's the correct key).  He should immediately despawn (just like the slaves in the zone).<br><br>On the other side of the wall lies Castle Crushbone.  This area is dangerous for a number of reasons.  The cents are a bit higher level than elsewhere in the zone, so watch out.  Legos will sometimes spawn near the bridge on the left.  If you go about halfway between the two bridges and look towards the castle, you'll see an open courtyard between the tower and the entrance.  At the opening of the courtyard a cent will spawn, sometimes a lego.  Further in, though, spawns an oracle, that is blue at level 19.  This bad boy will be triggered if you pull the other orc, so be careful.  He packs a punch, with a magic attack that has been known to do between 5 and 74 damage.<br><br>Once you've cleared that outer area of the castle and decide to go in, do yourself a favor and get a group.  From the moment you open that door, you're in danger.  Three or four cents spawn just inside the door.  When you go down the hall, two legos spawn at the opening to the throne room.  They'll come at you as soon as one of them spots you.  Inside, I believe there are 9 spawn points.  Behind the table will spawn an oracle, always an oracle.  Tell your casters to be careful when they med back there.  If the oracle pops, he'll immediately go on a rampage.  In the throne area are 8 spawns.  Two legos will spawn by the first two benches.  An emissary will spawn at the right wall, in front of the lego (I've seen the Warlord spawn in the em's place).  Two more legos will spawn on the last two benches. On the left, another nasty oracle will spawn.  To the right, an emissary.  In the middle, at the throne, is Lord Darish.  His placeholder is a lego stronger than the others.  The best way to break the room is to pull the two legos at the opening to the room first.  Then kill the oracle behind.  You want to try to pull as few orcs as possible, breaking up the kills.  This way, as new orcs spawn, you shouldn't have to deal with more than three at a time.<br><br>Behind the throne is the entrance to the tower, which winds up a staircase to the right.  In here spawn Emperor Crush, Ambassador D'Vinn, the Royal Guard, and The Prophet.  Oracles and cents are the placeholders.  The Royal Guard and Prophet aren't too much to write home about.  While they're stronger than the other orcs, they're not terrible.  Crush is a bit higher up the food chain.  He can pack a punch for lower teen groups.  Upper teen groups can take him without incident.  The real menace is D'Vinn.  He's an extremely strong Dark Elf, conning white at 19 and 20 for me.  He's hard to hit, parrying and riposting a lot, and also packs dual wield and double attack fists, with which he can do 40+ per hit.  He's fast, so don't think you can just outrun him.  D'Vinn is the reason why most of the under 20 crowd stay far away from the Tower.  I've seen him pulled by accident, and wipe out half a group before they can even leave the castle, and take another one or two before they can zone.  If you do train him and make it to the zone, he'll wander around for a couple of minutes, picking fights with anyone in the area.  After that I've seen him walk back to the tower.  However, I've also seen him Gate, apparently, back to his spawn in the tower.<br><br>The moral of the story is be extremely cautious when fighting in CB until you hit level 16 or so.  I've seen 10s and 11s walking around freely, but they usually wind up running into a few legos, slavers, or oracles, and training back to the zone.  Warriors can walk around rather freely once they hit around 14 with decent gear.  Casters have to be very careful, but should be able to wander by 15 since most orcs won't attack.  Mixed melee classes can walk around by level 15, though Rangers might have to wait slightly longer.  Rogues have to proceed much like casters, unless they've got very good gear.<br><br>My final tip: save at loot.  You use the belts in Kaladim until around level 10 for decent XP, and the pads work until around 17 or 18.  Once the XP dries up for the belts, you can collect them and sell them in GFay.  I've seen them go usually for 1pp per belt, though some are sold for as little as 5gp.  Pads are worth a lot more, fetching between 2 and 4pp per pad.  The Bracers of Battle drop from the rarely seen Warlord once in a while, but are worth a decent amount of money in GFay and beyond.  The Dwarven Ringmail Tunic Crush drops is good armor for those who can wear it, or can be sold for 20-25pp in GFay.  It's also a component of the Screaming Mace quest detailed in previous posts.  D'Vinn drops the Dragoon Dirk, which I've sold for around 40pp.  It fits in the range slot, and the added Dex and Save is useful if you have the space open.  The Shiny Brass Shield the Orc Trainer drops is a good low-level shield for those that use them.  If you can't or won't use the shield, sell it in GFay for around 10-15pp.  Or, if you're feeling generous, you can give it away to grateful newbies at the zone.<br><br>That's my story of crushbone.  I've spent countless hours in the zone, hunting for fun, profit, and XP.<br><br>P.S.  The moat that winds through CB is a great (safe) place to work on your swimming skill.<br><br>Drienne Gardairne<br>20th level Ranger<br>Saryrn Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yesterday, while trying to free the elven slaves in Crushbone, I was mobbed by 4 slavers.  Not wanting to start a train I decided to run to the rock ledge and cast an AOE on the group.  Being SOWed I made it to the ledge but failed to take into account the fact that only the first Orc that I was fighting had been snared.  I tried to cast my AOE but got an out of range message.  When the spell finally started, the first orcs came on me and interrupted (should have changed targets).  Frightened now, I ran backwards and fell into the moat.  This is when I learned that I had time to open my spell book, memorize gate, and then cast it before the orcs reluctantly entered the water.  Since I left from the middle of the area, hopefully this group of apes did not train to the zone.  But you never know, orcs mostly have very little brain.  Anyway, good to know you can gate from under water.<br><br>Tsuga, Druid of Tunare, 16 seasons<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I wasn't accually "trying" to fall in the moat but I tried to run from dvinn (while he was hitting me for 40 dmg) and fell in. for some reason dvinn just patroled arond the moat where I was. I decided to try gate and it DID work. unfortunatly i can't cast ignight under water lol. well I'm just giving advice but if you have gate it is MUCH NICER to gate in the moat rather that take a huge train to cb ent.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This zone is packed to the brim with good exp oppurtunities if you work it right. It is good for anyone levels 9 plus, or lower if you have a group. At level 9 you should probably hunt in the "orc commons" that is the area right outside the zone on this side of the river. there are quite a few centuron spawns here, and most of them arent linked (if you get in trouble the zone is just a stone's throw away anyhow). One note at this level, if you hear someone shout train, get out of there! the best place to hide(which also gives you a good veiw of the fools) is halfway up the big hill to the right of the commons. you can just sit there and nothing will agro you and you can watch the train disperse. i've been caught unawares several times and it's not pretty!<br>   at around 11 the spawns here will get so you can sweep through them with ease, so i suggest relocating to the slaver caves(located over the bridge to the left of the commons and then over the pile of rubble), here you can pick off the cent guards and occasionally there are slavers that spawn outside the caves. look out for the lego that sometimes spawns near the entrance, cuz he can really do you in at this level. If you get in really big trouble, you can run up to the sanctuary at the top of the hill(you'll see a steep slope to your left a little past the cabin) <br>. this place offers a nice place to heal before running to the zone because mobs usually cant folow you up here, it also provides a nice view of the lake. <br>  around level 12 the legos should start conning black, so it's time to hunt them. there are quite a few unlinked lego lego spawns:<br>1. at the entrance to the slaver caves area at the bottom of the slope<br>2. follow the river once in the slaver caves until you come to a bridge. on the other side, a lego or a cent is up on the ledge standing guard.<br>3. on the other side of that tunnel(accessed by following the left wall past the cabin) lego spawns in the mouth. make sure he doesnt run, because there is another spawn point a little farther in (with a cent to boot)<br>4. in the camp at the back of the caves area. this is usually populated by cents and pawns, but the occasional lego has been known to spawn here. most notably though, if you follow the wall to the left you will se several exits to their tents, legos usually spawn here, but they usually run back through the tent collecting more in the process. there is a lone sentry at the back of the camp, near the moat who is always a cent or a lego.<br>5. the moat area. this is probably the single best place to hunt legos. mainly because of the large concentration of people here willing to help you out in a pinch, dont worry there are plenty to go around... legos spawn at the bridges and slavers spawn behind the wall near the pits. just watch out for the throne room trains and you'll be fine.<br>   At level 14-15 you're ready for the the throne room itself, before you go in, make sure that it IS camped, otherwise you may find yourself in a lot of trouble. try to work out a deal with the camping group, it will usually work because there are so many spawns here that are so frequent, often groups have a hard time keeping up, and you should be able to pick off an emmissary here and there, or possibly even Lord Darish if the group lets you. outside the throne room, you can still hunt the moat area and the courtyard just outsid e the castle. if you get into trouble in the TR jump out the window, it's a lot faster.<br><br>Avaleor <br>Night Dragon of Xegony <br>15th level ranger  <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, my experiances are from a Half Elf Ranger and Paladin (both grew up around here!) <br><br>First, the first time i ventured into Crushbone was with my level 7 Paladin. I had hooked up with a good large group around lvls 8/9 and we went in. First place we hunted was the Slaver caves (or Cabin, whatever!) I was foolish enough to venture into the caves and was quickly dispatched by the two slavers there. I howvere leveled up to level 8 brfore running outta there, praying to Tunare to keep me alive. I leveld up Orc Camp in Greater Faydark till 9, thats when it first started geting interesting.<br><br>Once again, i grouped with some ppl my lvl (who also donated some armor pieces and weapon!) and we ran to the Slaver Camp (the tents) and hunted legos, i died several times using my LoH on our tank and getting snapped shortly after that, but i got more than enough exp to cover the deaths. That quickly got me to lvl 12, thats when you take a peek at Castle Crushbone.........<br><br>I got a well rounded group (getting as many healers as i could!) and hunted by the wall near the bridge outside the Castle Door. BIG MISTAKE! You do not realise how many trains go past and aggro onto you while your medding from a fight with a lego or emissary! I would suggest setting up camp around the other bridge (across from the castle... the warlord is frightening when he shows!) and kill the cents, legos and slavers, with the occasional Taskmaster thrown in. Be careful of the Taskmaster, hes pretty hard even for a level 13 to solo (but i can, and im proud of it!) Hunting around here should get you pretty close to 14, if not getting you to 14.<br><br>This is where having a group where most members are 1 or 2 lvls higher than you is vital! and for one reason...... this is when you first venture into the castle itself! Expect the spawns to be fast and furious, with the healers and casters frquently shouting "OOM!" and the tanks being reduced to under one bubb of health VERY quickly. I hunted here till lvl 16 and high tailed it out....... (hey, Half Elves are supposed to travel!)<br><br>Those are my tactics for a Paladin, but can easily be used for another tank (my ranger did nearly the exact thing). But for a rogue, i would suggest leveling up to around level 10 before going in (groups will want you more probably)<br><br>So good luck killing those accursed orcs...... :)<br>&nbsp;<br>"Constantly looking on the map for the road to success"</td></tr>

I been wandering around hidden so that I can get my bearings, and I think I can get some good loot and experience there if I'm careful. <br><br>I decided to hunt down and kill Rondo Dunfire for his tongue (yep, I'm a Dwarf!).

I could take the slaver by myself, but not that traitorous little snot at the same time.  <br><br>But the best part is that not only did Rondo jump in . . . but also one of the Elven slaves.  Said "You'll not ruin my lands!" or something like that, and cast a frost spell on me.  WTF?  Was this the Patty Hearst syndrome among the captives?!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>CB is where everyone of Faydwer comes to hunt till their low teens, if they've stayed at all (but who'd wanna leave, look at all the beautiful trees.....) Anyway, dont come in till your around level 7 or so, just to be safe ( i didnt enter till i was level 8, but i was busy with the 'doormen' just outside the zone). Level up around the entrance, outside the tunnel thingy, very dangerous, till around level 9. <br><br>Apon reaching level 9, get a solid group, maybe around 5 or 6, and head off to the slaver caves and cabin. There are medium level cents, slavers and an occasional legionaire. This is good hunting untill round level 11 0r even 12.<br><br>Then your ready for the slaver pits, or moat. Get another well rounded out group of similar level and set yourself against the bridge closest to the pits (trust me..... all the nasty trains go over the other bridge) kill the cents, legos (usually only 1 by 1) and slavers when they spawn. This sets you up until level 14/15. <br><br>This is where all the fun starts, upon hitting level 14, i found a good group (lots of people levels 16/17) and camped the throne room. The spawns are fast and furious, you MUST have a healer, but more the merrier. Oracles, Legos, and Emmys spawn relatively fast, and offer a couple of minutes of insane killing, then a few minutes a healing. BUT BEWARE! sometimes if you pull a emmisary that has just walked out of the tower, you will pull the inhabitants of the tower (always DVinn AND Crush, with my bad luck!) But the killing will be fun. You can deffinately get level 16 there, IF you have a good group and dont die to often. <br><br>By then, your ready to leave Crushbone, or even Faydwer!<br><br>Good luck young Elves/Dwarves/Gnomes..... the Faydark is counting on you............

	   <tr><td colspan=2>(Disclaimer: This tip involves making use of a pathing bug that may no longer exist. It worked quite well for me in my CB career, but it may have been fixed since.)<br><br>Here's a tip that I find many people don't know about in Crushbone...<br><br>When fighting in or near the legionnaire's tents or slaver caves, there is a safe spot nearby. As you head from the caves to the lego tents, look to your left. Immediately to the right of the lake is a tree, behind which you should see a steep uphill ramp. If you run up this ramp you will take a short drop (you will take no damage) and find yourself on a cliff overlooking the lake and slaver's cabin. To leave, simply drop off the edge into the lake and swim to shore.<br><br>This spot is important for one reason, which has two practical uses: Mobs cannot follow you up there, even if they are aggro.<br><br>(Note: I have learned that this is not true. I've been followed exactly ONE time, out of about 50-60 uses of this spot)<br><br>The first use of this tidbit of knowledge is obvious...if you're overwhelmed, you can buy yourself time to heal before running to the zone. I wouldn't suggest spending too long up there, as the aggro'd mobs WILL run around looking for you, which makes the train that much larger when you leave. This tends to irritate other players. Furthermore, this spot if not foolproof - just close enough that it's worth mentioning.<br><br>The second use is obvious for any casters. A nice, quiet spot to med with little to no chance of being interrupted by any big stinky blue orcs? Boo-yaa!!<br><br>Other, less practical uses of this spot are as follows:<br> - Photo Op!!! If you're into screenshots, this is a good one. I suggest the 3rd person far view. Try to time it so you are waving when you snap the pic. ("Greetings from Crushbone, wish you were here....")<br> - Alternate Exit... If you're careful (and don't mind taking a some hp's of falling damage) you can maneuver yourself further along the top of the cliff and jump to the top of the slaver's cabin. I admit, it's not the most useful knowledge in the world, but in a pinch it does make for a quicker escape than dropping into the lake and swimming.<br> - Spring Break...Crushbone Style!! Okay, I can't even pretend to twist this into anything useful. However, if you're bored and have a few plat to spare, go buy a large amount of alcohol (readily available in Kelethin) and take a group of your closest friends up the ramp for Drunken Cliff Diving. Yes, getting walleyed drunk and plummeting into icy water is rather pointless and stupid...but it's fun, and if you make enough noise about it you can quite accidentally get quite a party going in this otherwise rather grim zone. Some people will do ANYTHING for free booze.<br><br>Poco Lightfist, 24 Paladin, E Marr<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Given the popularity of the Gfay/Crushbone zones, I'm not suprised that the Crushbone is one of the most heavily camped areas in Faydwer. Because of this, its almost impossible to get a particular item (the infamous Bracer of Battle comes to mind) when you need it since there is most likely some group already camping the area if not that particular spawn, and unless you can slip in right after they leave you probably will return to find it camped by a different group. Given this situation, I've put down a few ideas that can help you get that item your after even if the spawn is already camped.<br><br>First off, unless you've already tried the nice approach and gotten a nasty response, ask the group camping the area if they are after your particular spawn, a particular spawn, or just hunting the entire area. If they aren't after your spawn, then ask if you can have whatever the creature is when it appears, or if they are or are hunting the general area see if you can strike some form of bargain with them in exchange for the item (particullary if they plan on getting more than one). In either case you have to keep a very level head and keep things as polite as you can. If this doesn't work you may have to fall back on the "play nice" policy - if they are in some sort of violation of it point it out, then offer to reach some arrangment instead of petitioning for a guide or GM. If neither of these work (and it won't with some groups or item farmers) your only option left (outside of a violation of the play policy or training them) will probably be to wait until they've been killed then moving your group in to take the camp then holding it by force.<br><br>If you you do reach some sort of arrangement (even if its under the threat of petition), offer them something in return for sharing the camp. If they seem a bit low on casters, offer to provide buffing and/or healing to them while your waiting for the spawns yours after. Even high-level groups will usually be more than glad to be able to save their casters spells for during the fight instead of healing and buffing afterwards. If their tanks are always busy with the target, have your group offer to body-guard their casters (maybe parking them in the center of your group so the orcs have to get through you to reach them). With the orcs spawning everywhere in the room casters are in constant danger of being attacked while the rest of the group is busy. If you've developed a superior ability in a trade skill (smithing, tailoring, flecthing, or the jeweler/enechant combination) you might be able to offer those skills after the group leaves the camp. An offer to make high-grade armor (banded, cured silk, reinforced leather, etc), superior bows and arrows, or enchanted jewelry below market cost might be even better recieved than a direct payment for the item, plus its a good way to get your name out as a craftsman (advertising never hurt anyone).<br><br>Third, if you do get an offer into the group or some other arrangement for what you're after, try to be as helpful to them after you have it and the camp is left as when you were still after the item. If they aren't familiar with the area (especially Kelethin) and want to sell or train there, offer to act as a guide. With groups that include races/classes that are KOS or have very poor faction with merchants, offer to do the sale yourself at no charge and to buy anything they may need from the merchants (usually best bought from your own guild if possible so they get the best price). If they express an interest in making this their new home and you have friends able to (assuming you can't yourself) offer to try to find them free or low-cost binds; if they intend to move on after this instead, make the attempt to find them useful traveling spells such as Group Gates and Spirit of Wolf for free or little cost. By making the obvious effort to help them out as best you can even if you won't ever see them again, you insure a good reputation for yourself, and in the event you do meet them you might find yourself with offers to group or a few free enhancements.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A good way I've found to use your starting spells with the bow (especially in places like CB that restrict a creatures movement) is to open up with a Flame Lick, then shoot it full of arrows as it closes. Save the snare until the orc is out of the others agro range - otherwise you can get several of the buggers on you at once. Once it is snared just keep backing up and shooting until your ready to close into melee. The Flamelick makes sure the orc doesn't heal and adds a bit more damage in the process - plus if your in a group it makes it more likely to attack you (a tanker) rather than a caster.<br><br>If you have a partner (or are ranger of 15+ levels) with a root-type spell (I pefer clerics since they also have blinding spells), when you get the target into place, have the caster root it so it can't go anywhere. Then just sit back and shoot it full of arrows while the DoT keeps it from healing. The blind spells are used to keep the creature from running towards help (or you) if it breaks the root/snare combo. This way you don't have to worry about that centurion running back to the camp and grabbing a few Legionaires to help him out.<br><br>As a last little tidbit for groups hunting in Crushbone: if you plan on camping the lego's tents, get a caster or bowman up on the ridge that overlooks the camp. Because of its position someone with a ranged weapon or spells there can rain death on the camp and the only way for the orcs to reach him is to go completely around the edge. This gives your artillery plenty of time to run, hide/sneak/invis from the target, gate out, or any other nasty little ideas your minds can envision.<br><br>Hope this makes things at bit easier in Crushbone, since with the constant threat of "D'Vinn to zone" we certainly have enough trouble as-is. Good luck, happy hunting, and don't meditate on the birdges (trust me, its a bad idea).<br><br>Rendale<br>Fier'Dal Ranger of 15 seasons<br>Drinal<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
