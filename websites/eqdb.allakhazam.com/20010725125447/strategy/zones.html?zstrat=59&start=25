Just go in the zone with a few friends, 2 or 3, when it is basically empty like late on a sunday night and raise some hell.  It was so much fun.  Three of us from 20 to 24 killed absolutely everything in  there, over and over again.  And BTW the Dwarven Ringmail drops way too often.  Its ridiculus.  We must have killed Crush like 15 times and he dropped the thing all but once.  So if you ever get bored or cant think of anything to do, go to CB and own the place.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Here is a little something i knocked up for my guild and im posting here (please email comments to Basho@particle-design.co.uk<br><br>Crushbone tactics<br><br>This map is a lot of fun to play but very crowded.  I have played here for 5+ lvl's and have some advice so people new to its charms.<br><br>General:  When quiet be careful: more Orks will spawn and pulling Two Lego&#8217;s is no fun for any lvl.  When busy be careful: a quick check on /who will tell you the likelihood of Bad to Uber trains here.  Lots of lower lvl&#8217;s = Kings Cross-Station.  Lots of higher lvl&#8217;s (people with surnames) = forget it, only weaker (Upney) Throne Room Trains.<br><br>Tunnel:  Trains to the tunnel will be the tougher Ork&#8217;s people run from.  If you are low lvl or health fight with your back to the zone border and you can escape the Train whilst keeping your eyes peeled for more baddies arriving (the infamous &#8220;Second Wave&#8221; which usually is the Last guy to run from castle followed by Emperor Crush and some Royal Guards).  The Orks have a strange pathing route through here so learn it and you can avoid any Train in time.<br><br>Trainer hill: When not camped you can pull the Trainer on his own by standing close to the tree and using your bow.  THEN run down the hill and wait for him at the slope up.  If in trouble just fall back off and run to zone.  Trainer drops the Shiny Brass Shield once in a blue moon.  Trains from here take FOREVER to reach the tunnel (because of a strange routing path) and consist of the Centurions, Trainer, and some buddies they picked up on the way.  Don&#8217;t shout &#8220;TRAIN&#8221; too quickly because you will look very foolish when ten PC&#8217;s run up to help and nothing can be seen.  Wait&#8230;<br><br>Outside Castle Main Drawbridge: Main Train route from castle, but a lot of people camp here and send in a puller.  A nice spot but usually not anything better than the guard Lego&#8217;s.  If the Throne Room Group come tumbling out the castle doors and windows, then a big train is coming directly after them.  Be careful to avoid anything you can&#8217;t handle.<br><br>Outside Castle Rear Drawbridge &#8220;The Pit&#8221; : This is a multidirectional camp.  You have Slavers from the rear, Lego&#8217;s and Centurions from the front and sides, Oracles from the castle grounds and sometimes trains from the Throne Room following a jumper from the window.  Nice!  A good group on a quiet day will get almost constant Mob&#8217;s attacking them if that&#8217;s your powder.  However, when CB is full and all the camps are packed, then this camp spot is not for groups above 12 as passing traffic will be dead before you get it.  One thing to note this camp is usually first to spot the Warlord (rare spawn &#8211; needed for Screaming Mace Quest) who I've mostly seen on the castle-side of the bridge.  If you should be so lucky to get to him first then make sure you loot him as SOON as he drops because Kill Stealing is rampant on this MOB.<br><br>Tent City (Lego&#8217;s Camp): This is an area for a nice small group of around 4 and is never camped because it&#8217;s a bit boring.<br><br>Slavers Hut (Slave Pits) : This camp is great for 10 &#8211; 14 lvl&#8217;s because (again) you will get hit from all sides.  A good number of Melee Classes can avoid the casters getting jumped.  The pits themselves have slavers who drop keys to the Elf Slaves around the Zone.  Get the keys and give them to the right slave for some nice EXP.  The Top Slaver there conned Blue to me last night (Very Quiet &#8211; 5 players in zone) and I&#8217;m lvl 16 warrior.  The named Dwarf here drops his tongue for a Pally quest.  The Big hut has the NPC&#8217;s needed for the Screaming Mace Quest.<br><br>Screaming Mace Quest: Follow these instructions to complete this (long) quest.<br><br>1. Get 15pp and buy the Dwalfen Ringmail Tunic in Greater Faydark.  Don&#8217;t pay more than this.  Alternatively get a KICK arse group and camp the Throne Room Tower (see below)<br>2. Wait, and wait, and wait, and wait for Warlord to spawn.  Various theories abound about getting him to spawn, but my two favourites are that Crush and Dvinn Must have been slayed first.  Or that All the placeholders have to be killed (Ork Pawns).  I try both.  When you finally get him you are looking to loot the Bracer of Battle.  Once you have it you will be pestered by everyone in the map to sell it to them &#8211; DON&#8217;T!  It is a very rare item.<br>3. Goto Slave hut.  Talk to the FIRST Dwarf blacksmith and say &#8220;the king is dead&#8221; and &#8220;what about ringmail?&#8221; Sometimes it takes a few tries&#8217;s for him to respond.  Once he asks for the Tunic give it to him for a Mace<br>4. Move to your right and say to the Elven Priest &#8220;the king is dead&#8221;.  Once he responds give him the Bracer and he will give you the Prayer Cloth.  He will then ask for both the cloth and the mace.<br>5. I gave him both at the same time.  <br>6. He will give you the screaming mace back.  This is a magical mace which Yaulps in battle (occasionally, depends on level and DEX)  Yaulp buffs you STR by 10 and your AC by around 7.  It can sell for around 75pp in Greater faydark right up to 125pp in Freeport or further away.<br>7. For PITY&#8217;S sake if you keep it be sure to have trained 1HB or your be in the same boat as me pouring in all you points after levelling (DOH!)<br><br>Throne Room: This camp is hard for two reasons.   <br><br>1. The route into the room is thin and if you have big players in your group you will be stuck in one-on-many battles.   <br>2. It is possible to pull the whole damn room in one go and die very quickly due to the above problem.   My advice is too Wait outside by the caslte walls, and pull the MOB&#8217;s carefully to lessen the resistance left inside.  Once trimmed occupy the doorway to the throne room itself with the casters WELL BACK, and then pull the room and rush to the table.  Once you have the room you will come under a lot of MOB pressure almost constantly.  Get the group to stay by the table and don&#8217;t go up to the throne or you will pull those MOBs in the tower as well.  <br><br>To hold here you will need (in my opinion) at least lvl 14+ PC&#8217;s.  One pure Melee, Two or Three Mixed Melee, One or Two Wizards, and One or Two Healers.  Bards (the warrior&#8217;s best friend) are my favourite mixed melee as well as rouges.  <br><br>When I grouped here best: the Wizard stood back and concentrated firepower on the magical Orks or the toughest fighter.  <br><br>I like it when everyone fights and no one quits or chickens out, but that sometimes cannot be avoided and when RUN is called, jump out one of the windows.  DO NOT try and run back through the corridors because you can run into Two Lego&#8217;s inside and another outside on the bridge.  (This is how the Uber train gets going).  Also, when running don&#8217;t be afraid to jump into the moat as long as you can swim well, this can sometimes gain you valuable seconds on your retreat.  Dying here can be a right pain so AT LEAST make sure you get out of the castle before dying :)<br><br>The Tower: This is the final challenge on this zone.  All the TOP Orks spawn here (Crush, Prophet, Dvinn) and subsequently this can be a very camped area by the higher lvl players (Prophet has a head for a high quest etc).  Be aware that space is at a premium so I would only recommend fighting here if you are 20+ and with friends.  Dying up here is a very bad thing to do.  Dvinn is a Dark Elf and has some nasty hit stats to say the least.  <br><br>All the Tower Orks will train after you all the way to the zone if you run! Especially if you run back through the throne room and out the main door (/em Shakes his head in disbelief) I&#8217;ve seen a train at the tunnel that took twenty people to sort out, which for a Lower Teen lvl zone is very bad.<br><br>One thing to note, a good bowmen or high lvl spell caster can sometimes pull Crush from outside the castle by shooting up at the tower.  This can sometimes result in only crush coming out to play (I&#8217;ve seen a high lvl player farm him this way).  Although, its worth noting that I&#8217;ve ALSO seen this cause the wobbly group holding the TR to run pulling the rest of the castle along with him. CHOO CHOOO!<br><br>One final thing: Killing Orks puts you in the Faydark Guards good books and I&#8217;ve gone from Apprehensive to Warmly in no time.<br><br>All in all Crushbone has something for everyone.  After the listlessness of East Common Lands and the barren death trap that is North Ro I have found CrushBone to be the best Lower Teen Zone I&#8217;ve yet come across.  I still get EXP, meet good people, mix with higher lvl&#8217;s, get my skills up, and make some good profit here (off the unique items at least).  Myself, I mix this zone in with a couple of runs to Steamfont (Love those Minotaurs!) and make around 20pp a night selling their axes to Newbies (and I&#8217;ve gone up 7 lvl&#8217;s in a good time).<br><br>Enjoy!!<br><br>Yours in Combat,<br><br>Basho the poet<br><br>16th Lvl Human Warrior of Saryrn<br><br>	&#8220;First intention, then enlightenment&#8221;<br>					The Buddha<br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

The times I've seen a group at full-strength and ready for a fight just sitting around the zone waiting for a train are very, very rare (I've seen zero so far in the 10 levels I've been there). A train that hits these people can be much more dangerous than just levels indicate since most casters are at low mana levels and the tanks are delepted in health. Add in the chaos that can result from the lower levels running to the zone to escape the train and the mid-levels trying to determine if they can stay and help (and have a reasonable chance of living) or should run, by the time any sort of response to stop the train is ready a lot of people are going to be dead or severly hurt and a lot of groups plans temporairly derailed.<br><br>While I doubt any player exists that hasn't caused a train, there is a considerable difference between someone who makes a short-distance pull that goes badly because of cirmcumstances beyond their control, and the person that deliberatly pulls some of the most powerful creatures in a zone to the only escape route simply for the fun of it or because his group is afraid to fight without a zone to their backs.<br><br>To sum up the entire post: the best advice for deliberatly pulling a higher-level train to the zone in Crushbone is don't. The added saftey of fighting with the zone to your back isn't worth loosing your account, or finding yourself an outcast.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Tired of having your spells interupted when trying to get the legos? With a little practice, there is a glitch that makes them fish in a barrel for 8-12 wizzy. There is a ledge just past the flag pole when entering the zone. It starts almost in front of the pole and extends toward the bridge on the left.<br><br>The trick is that the orcs have to get up on the ledge on the far left hand side nearest the bridge. If you get on the far right hand side, you can jump up and down the ledge causing the orcs to turn around, run back to the end of the legge then come back to attack. By the time they get to you, you just jump back up/down. The have to run all the way back again to get you.<br><br>It takes a little practice to get the timing down, and be careful not to pull more than 1 or 2 legos. If you do, the zone is near. Also BEWARE the trains! They will run very near this area, so be prepared to zone if some one pulls a big train from the castle.<br><br>This strategy works well for lower level partners where one can pull while the caster waits on the ledge. <br><br>Good luck and happy hunting!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The experience is good, but there are a few things to be really careful of there and a few ideas that might help you avoid that boring run from the Orc lift to get your body (or getting a train dragged onto you by an very irrate ex-group member that has a valid reason to be PO'ed). I've watched a number of groups (good, bad, and mediocre) try that room and I'd like to believe I've learned atleast a few things about handling that place.<br><br>One, regardless of what anyone says there is no completely safe spot to rest in there even for a short time. You always have things with large aggro ranges popping up all around you and for such big ugly mugs those orcs are stealthy. Add in the background "noise" from the groups hunting outside and you won't know that that lego is after you until "An Orc Legionairee hits YOU for 20 damage." Always have atleast 1 (2 is better) people on watch so if something does pop up you get warning and it can be dealt with quickly.<br><br>Two, if there's a group in the tower be prepared to have trouble dragged onto your head and have an escape plan ready. Unless the tower hunters are very skilled and/or massively powerful you will likely have Crush, D'vinn, the Prophet, or Royal Guard heading your way and a bunch of irritated legos and cents trying to get inside if they make it to the passage. I've been caught mid-evacuation several times in a press between the two group and its not pretty. I've been in most low-to-mid teen areas and I think that castle is about the worst for getting a body back if you don't have some form of invisibility handy. Between having to cross a guarded bridge then the entrance and that narrow passage you have little if any room to slip past an orc, and when you do loot your body unless you've been able to drag it back outside (remember point one?) your at constant risk of being blind-sided while half-naked by orcs known to be bash-happy. Get stunned when your down and your going to be retreiving 2 corpses this time.<br><br>Third, make sure you know who is doing what when and to whom its being done. Since normal pull-and-butcher tactics don't work well here with the spawns popping up all around you its very hard to get just a single critter alone for killing, the ability of your group to coordinate becomes vital. If you have people capable of crowd control (enchanters are best but anyone with harmony, stun, or even root spells will do in a pinch) you need to use it. Single out one orc and have your traffic cops neutralize the rest, then completely elminate the target before moving to the next one (and make sure that all the nukers/tankers are going after the SAME orc). If you don't have good crowd control then the tanks have to deploy to engage mupliple targets so your casters don't get slaughtered by a stray legonairee. This means your casters will really have to work overtime in the coordination deparment. Instead of "pick your target and vaporize it" they need to concentrate on knocking out each target in turn as quickly as possible; I recommend starting with the smaller orcs unless there's a real threat of one tank beind killed (and freeing up one orc to reap mayhem). The tougher orcs seem to have better resists so its more effective to fry the small stuff to free up the tanks to deal with the big threats.<br><br>Fourth, and this is a particular peeve of mine, get a fair loot plan decieded before the loot drops then stick to it even if its means booting a member. Since the majority of the money to be made here (and it can amount to a decent amount on a long camp) is in the form of non-lore items sold to players like shoulder pads and the occasional dwarven axes rather than cash or high-price lore items, you need to insure that everyone gets a fair split. Even when someone whines that they just need "3 more shoulder pads so I can level" make them wait until their turn comes up. I've seen (and been in) a number of groups that disintergrated with very nasty feelings because one or two people grabbed all the loot while the rest were busy healing/meditating or watching out for new spawns. This normally results in a group that can't hold the room and either has to leave or gets slaughtered and then still has to leave. The solution I've used most often is to have a single master looter (usually the most-trusted person or someone to whom the loot is relatiively useless and if no one like that is available I try to get a person from a guild with an ethics policy and/or substantial collateral) who loots the bodies then divides it up into equal shares. If someone expresses a particular interest in an item (for example, the cleric wants the Bracer of Battle or the fighter is eyeing that dwarven axe) consider letting them have it - but ONLY if they are willing to surrendor a portion (or all) of their share of the loot. I normally exclude coin purchases from this since CB doesn't give any large payouts and its already divided up by autosplit.<br><br>If anyone else has any tricks, ideas, or ways to make that room work better let me know. Next time I'm in the CB area I'll give them a try. Ill Omen gets repetitive (plus down right hazardous when the SoW goes on a long pull) when your elected group puller constantly. Nothing like cutting helpless orcs into pieces and leaving their decaying bodies for the younger generation to loot to remind you why its all worth it. Plus getting the occasional item you can use is nice too.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Now if you can  kill the Orc Warlord or Dvinn solo, thats great! The only thing that isn't is that you bring a huge train of orcs out with him, and anyone in there path without an mid level teen group, will be slaughtered. So please, if you know you can't handle all of those Orcs stay out of the tower.<br><br>I personally like to camp by the wall with a group or even the throne room itself, but this can be a very deadly camp. Many people run out of the tower with Crush or Dvinn on there ass and they try to make it to the zone, running right past the wall with a big train. 9 times out of 10 they die. Even more-so if they are going at it Solo. That leaves your 12-16th level group to take the fall, in which you have two choices. 1- Die (not so popular) 2- run for the zone. When running (the orcs give chase of course) even if you make it to the zone you leave who ever else is in the entrence to CB, to die. Was it your fault? Maybe.... but I'd blame it on the person who pulled Dvinn out of the castle before the person who was just trying to save there neck. Anyway, if this ever happens to you you will be blamed for pulling a train to the zone when it wasn't even your fault. Sound fair?...... Well it isn't. These trains are death to most and don't care if your level 30 or level 5, so watch out for that one person who you know is going to get your group killed.<br><br>PS - When someone shouts TRAIN, it could be a slaver, a lego, or even Dvinn.

It's quite easy to make some really good experience soloing here as low as level 5 or 6. You just have to be careful. Some tips are to stay out of the way of trains. There are a lot of them, and they can kill you fast. Of course, that's true all the way up to the 20s, crushbone trains are never friendly. Look at the size of the centurion before fighting it. The higher the level, the bigger the cent. This isn't so noticable with Legionaires, but with Cents especially you can get an idea if it's on the high end of blue or the low end by it's size. Assuming it's blue, of course. My favorite spot at low level is the first bridge if you go left out of the zone. Rarely camped, most of the spawns there are low level, and if you see something you don't want to fight, there's a good chance that the next group going past on the way to the slaver camps will pick it off for you.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

The other, is The Warlord who is remembered for his BoB, a fairly ex@#%^ve wrist slot item that adds Str, Dex, and AC, and is also used in the Screaming Mace quest.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>     So you are bored of orc hill? GOOD!!!! Now you come to crushbone.  There are many fun and rewarding quests here.  It would take a long ime to name them all and describe them but here are a few.  The Shiny Brass Shield quest give you the shield which is fairly rewarding for most classes since they can use it.  Look through ALlaKhazam's quest guide for information on the quests here.  Some very popular spots here are trainer hill, orc camp, crush castle, slaver mine, and slaver camp.  <br>      Trainer hill is home to the orc trainer who hold some decent items.  On the hill there are also cents,and an occasional pawn.<br>      Orc camp is home to must of the most common orcs like pawns, cents, legos and sometimes slavers.<br>      Crush Castle is popular inside and out.  Out side is home to legos and cents.  Inide however hold all the orcs including Emporer Crush and D'vinn.<br>      Slaver Mines or caves are the most common place for slavers.  Most people go there to free slaves but there other slave spots.  In case of an emergency there is a back way out of the cave.  In an absolute emergency there is a waterway in the back that leads out of the cave.  Make sure you swim fast or have a speed spell or you will die in the water.<br>       Slaver Camp is basically the same thing as the cave but is the outside part of it.  It consists of a couple cabins and apond in the back of it.  Manily the same stuff from the mines are here but less slaves and orcs.<br>       A word to the wise there are many stray unmentioned orc around that Ihave not met personally.  I am only lv 9 but I invised myself and explored a lot.  D'vinn has a pet I believe or some other but I beilieve it looks like an elemental and is about lv 10 or 11.  <br>       Crushbone can be very dangerous for the solo artist so be careful alone.  Try to stay in groups because you never know when the orcs will call you their next victim.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Terinan Iceforest</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you play it safe however and kill only what you can, CB can be an enjoying and money making experience. The loot is very good (CB belts sell for 1-2pp to other players and Lego pads sell for 2-3pp), the exp is good and the faction gain is great for all but dark elves. If they do hunt in CB, they will become KO's in Neriak which then gives them a very lonely life, being welocome in even less places. For all you non DE tanks out there, this is a guide i have compiled which will hopefully make your life easier. The level guides i have included are for non-twinked players, twinked chars can handle the mobs at significantly lower levels.<br><br>As a tank you can go into CB from about level 4 or 5 onwards. At this level GET OUT OF THE TUNNEL. It is said to be safe by many but IMHO it is the second most dangerous place to be in CB (first being the TR) because this is where ALL the trains will end up. <br>You should start by going left from the entrance to the bridge, everything here should be easy to kill in a group of 4-6 members of your level (because the all aggro) but once you reach 6 or 7 you will be able to solo all of them at once. After this, you should move on to trainer hill. In a group you will be able to take all the spawns with ease except when the trainer spawns high. The trainer also occasionally drops the SBS which can be used or sold for about 10-20pp. <br>At about level 10/11(or lower if a big group), you and your group can safely move into the slaver caves with the group waiting outside by the slaver hut (with the NPC's for the screaming mace quest) and the tank pulling from inside. Slavers and cents are the main spawns here with the occasional pawns and lego's. The lego's are great exp if there is only one but if there are more it can get tricky.<br>At 13you have the choice of several hunting areas:<br><br>1. The tunnel and entrance to GFay - mopping up the trains from the castle that happen regularly<br><br>2. The slaver pit where the taskmaster spawns<br><br>3. Outside the castle killing lego's slavers and the occasional emissary and royal guard from the throne room that is trained out - don't go INside unless there are at least 10 of you at your level because nobody likes low levels training crush and D'Vinn and wiping out half of CB's current PC population!<br><br>This will give you good exp till about 15 or 16. Now is the time for the fun to begin. Many people will have left CB by now because of the repetition of killing orcs, however now you go into the throne room (in a LARGE group - at least 4) and get some real action. The TR has a reasonably fast spawn rate and you WILL need a healer and its also nice to have a couple of pet classes as the pets can take the strain from you. Make sure you kill oracles, royal guards and emissarys first. These oracles are not like the others you fought before. They are mid to high tens in level and can hit in the 20's whilst casting lots of nasty spells on you. BEWARE. If your group is the only one there and D'Vinn spawns, run like hell! The best option is send a pet on him and jump out the window and run to zone. Don't stop otherwise you WILL die at this level. Level 20's still shiver at the thought of being put up against D'VInn. He hits for up to 44 HP a hit and has dual wield and double attack and stuns regularly. This means that if he attacks you you will lose several hundred Hp in a matter of seconds.<br><br>Nabot - 13 paladin of Bristlebane (always LFG)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You have tried all the spots mentioned and still get trained by some fool?  Well, take a meander over by the slaver hut, going the route that start with a left out of the zoen tunnel.  After you clear the slaver hut there is an incline that elades up to the lego / cent camp area.  Dont go there, someone is starting a train there.  INstead, step inside the little alcove to the left just past the water.  In here is a double spawn point, and 50% of the time one of the two will be a lego.  If you are medding in the alcove corner nearest the camp I just mentioned, you are out of aggro range for this spawn.  The lego spawn is on the same level as you, the cent spawn is on the ledge up and to the right.  The tunnel up there just elads to the back of the small hut across from the slaver cave - nothing ever comes through there.  My level 10 paladin was soloing legionaires at this spot.  If the spawn is going slow, you can pull a mob from the camp above, with caution...<br>&nbsp;<br>Warven Soulwraith<br>Eci Server</td></tr>

To the left of the zone ent where the bridge crosses the river. instead of going over just follow the wall and there is a spot where you can safely med and pull from 4-5 spawn points. this works really well with pets though i havent used a wizzy. you can lvl quickly here and not get hit by trains =-) Good luck and good hunting<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I first really started hunting in crushbone around level 8 as a ranger. I always looked for a group to do something higher than I could do solo, yet groups aren't always able to find, so I realized where I could and couldn't hunt.<br>Level 8-10<br>  There is no real "Good" place to camp in this zone as a solo ranger at this level, I advise wandering around the entrance pulling the solo centurions who spawn in the general area, always snare at the begining of the fight, so should every orc in the zone decide that you are the next canidate for being a bloody pulp, you can escape, not that that is a unique ranger stragedy, but it deserves reiterating.<br>Level 10-12<br>   At these levels I would suggest going to trainer hill. If the hill is clear when you get up there and camp all the spawns, getting occasional blue cents and the trainer should be killable solo most of the times, with an occasional one that will beat you, if the hill is full, I would suggest heading into the slaver caves, maybe with a partner, and handling the orc slavers.<br>Level 13-14<br>    The hill and the caves are still great places to solo at these levels, and a partner could make essentially every lego in the zone, if one could be found. The hill is less preferable at this level due to the only spawn that consistenly will give exp is the trainer, The slave pits can be done, just be careful of the Taskmaster, who could be taken down with few problems, Just be fully healed.<br>Levels 15-16<br>    The lego camp was great for these levels when I couldn't find a group. The legos spawn consitently enough to yield constintent EXP and almost no one ever camps the area. Virtually all the centurions in the zone will stop aggroing on you. The castle is also a place to go if another group is in there, politely ask to take a split of the spawn, and many groups will let you take a lego or 2 off their backs if you ask politely (always play nice)<br>Levels 17+<br>    I would personally advise leaving this zone around this level, The legos who are the bread and butter of this zone will still give exp, but are begining to con green, and better exp lies elsewhere. If you still feel you want to stay I would advise going into the throneroom... <br><br>Partners-<br><br>Normally working fighter/healers pairs will work well in this zone (and basicily any Zone). You could basicilly take the step up the little list I have and take a higher group.<br><br>Group play-<br><br>Lower level groups seem to handle both of the slave areas with ease.. Higher groups (13ish) can start venturing into the throneroom for better exp and even the throne room is some high level is camping Dvinn. <br><br>This is what worked for me as a ranger, It would probably work for any of the melee classes, I think that the Casters would do things differently, and I can't comment on any of the caster classes, Don't follow my little speech if you are one of those classes, or don't yell at me when it doesn't work. Crushbone is a great low level zone, with less trains than Blackburrow and an easier map than Blackburrow too. Anyway, thats my 2cp, enjoy<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Aw, com'on, make the monk pull-<br>Vaquero</td></tr>

But at level 5!You should hunt the orcs inside Crushbone near zoneline. Why? because: a.) you can run zone. b.) Belt for quest.(the orcs on hill no belts.)It just sounds dumb to run from orc hill all the way to guards when you know you can't take them.Why don't hunt near zoneline? Just be aware of the trains from castle is ok. =(  And yet, when you are level 10- 15 go hunt near the slavers for key quest. Ask the players there, there is a SAFE POINT near the pond and the village for the legionaries. That safe point still working. If you got a train and you are a melee, run up there and rest until you got full hp and ready to run zone.If you a caster, just go up there and gate. I love there.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>There is a really easy way to make a mark nuking in Crushbone that will get fast experience.  Dispite having a downtime, it is a great way for wizards to murder solo due to difficulty getting spells off while being hammered by mobs.<br><br>As you enter CB to the left is the bridge and the river.  Move forward until you are about parallel to the ramp leading off to the slaves on the opposite side of the river.<br><br>For some reason, NPC's are scared of water.<br><br>First of all, ignore the bot spells.  The mobs will move.<br><br>Cast your first offensive spell at a mob on the ramp and wait.  It will run towards you and take the long way to get there.<br><br>Keep blasting.  If you pull it off right you can kill it or bring it to one spell from death before it reaches you.  Yeah it will run your mana into the ground but you don't have to dirty your hands.<br><br>Some tips:  <br><br>1. Make sure the bridge is clear before pulling.  It gets ugly when three or four centurians rush you all at once.<br><br>2. The space between the two trees on that side of the banks is relatively free of spawns and, except for once in a blue moon, rarely trained.<br><br>3. If you pick your spot well you can see three spawn points; the ramp, and the two bridges.  More spawns is a good thing in CB which is habitualy over-crowded.<br><br>4. The pawns are green but kill them anyway.  They are place holders and the quicker they die, the quicker better mobs will show up.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First, if centurians are still tough for you, you're better off fighting the many that spawn outside.  What, centurians too easy?  Welcome to Crushbone!<br><br>After cents, slavers are the next targets.  In addition to the better exp for killing them, you get exp and faction for freeing the slaves with the keys you'll find.  Slavers can be found near the slave pits on the right or the caves on the left.<br><br>The key faction varies by the race of the slave you free.  Here are how the keys work:<br><br>#15 - Frees Retlon Brenclog, the gnome mage in the far right pit.  He doesn't go aggro on everyone when you free him with a key as many suppose.  If you see him on a killing spree in the zone, it's likely because someone attacked him or his pet and either ran or paid the consequences.  Any slave pulled from their spawn in this manner will aggro on people killing orcs.<br><br>#16 & #17 - Free male and female dwarves, respectively.<br><br>#18 & #19 - Free male and female wood elves, respectively.<br><br>#20 & #21 - Free male and female high elves, respectively.  It's good to free these folks quickly with keys because they'll heal the orcs while you're fighting if they're held captive nearby.<br><br>I have no idea what keys #22 - #24 do, though the slavers drop them.<br><br>You'll still have the occasional cent or legionaire spawn instead of a slaver.  If you're fighting by the pits on the right, the taskmaster also spawns there.  His earring is a kind of wild-card key that will free any slave.  If the slavers are giving you much trouble, you'll have a lot of trouble with the taskmaster.<br><br>In addition to slavers, the orc trainer on the top of the hill sometimes drops a shiny brass shield, so he's frequently camped.  There are also three pairs of cent spawns on top of the hill.  The trainer spawns just the other side of the fire.<br><br>Once slavers are easy, move on to legionaires.  The two popular places to fight them are the two bridges near the castle entrance.  Warning, though, the one closer to the zone sometimes gets trained from the castle.  Remember to save those centurion belts and legionaire shoulder pads for the quests in Kaladim... the experience adds up.  The legionaire bracers aren't a quest item that I know of.<br><br>Once you can take on legionaires with no sweat, you're ready to move into a group for the castle's throne room.  If the room is fully spawned, it's got a lot of orcs there, and many an unwary adventurer has pulled half the room just trying to get a peek.  You need a fairly full group at the low end (actually, two lower level groups or one higher level can comfortably hold the throne room).  This will see you well into your teens, but you really need a good-sized group if they're still good exp for you.<br><br>Behind the throne is the passage up to the tower, where Emperor Crush and Ambassador D'Vinn spawn.  D'Vinn is a dark-elf rogue in the high teens, but hits a lot harder than his level if he were a PC.  A full group in their upper teens or a few higher level folks are needed to wipe him out.  If you can take D'Vinn, Crush is no problem (unless they happen to spawn at the same time).  Crush often drops the dwarven ringmail tunic, nice to wear or use it for the screaming mace quest.<br><br>One last notable spawn is the warlord, who is much-sought-after because he sometimes drops the bracers of battle needed for the screaming mace quest.  He roams around the castle area, so you may run into him inside or outside the castle.  He seems to be the hardest orc to kill aside from Crush.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
