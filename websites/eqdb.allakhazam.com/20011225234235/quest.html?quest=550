You must do the first part at least once.  It is possible that once you have done the first part, you can just get the shackles each time you do the quest.  You also need to do the Steel Warrior initiation quest before doing this.  You probably need a high faction with the steel warriors to complete the quest.   Here are the details:<br><br>[1] Go to the basement of the arena in South Qeynos and talk to Grahan Rothgar.  He will ask you if '...you have a report of the [escaped catman].'  Ask him What escaped catman.  He will give you the story and ask if you want to '...[retrieve key seven].' You can continue the quest anyway, but you will get nothing for it; no faction, no xp, no item, no nothing.<br><br>[2] Grahan will tell you to go to Wisp Isle (in Erud's Crossing) and kill the catman named Nomala.  Yes, there is a catman named 'Monola' but that is the wrong catman.  The correct catman is named 'Nomala'.  He is not as high level as any of the other cats but tends to gather a mob.  Best strategy to kill him is in Step 3. <br><br>[3] Go to Wisp Isle (the only one in Erud's Crossing).  Nomala will spawn by the fire.  Once killed, he will not spawn again for another hour or two, so figure on taking a while to do this.  Be warned that you lose faction with Prexus for killing these catmen. Anyway, he will stand there for a bit, then walk off toward the shore down by the dock.  Milla is standing around close by, but if you wait about one minute, she will walk off and leave Nomala all alone.  Kill him - but don't let him run, kill him quick.  Best bet is to hit him once then run a few feet down shore away from their village.  He does not always have the key.  <br><br>[4] Return the key to Grahan and you get xp, faction, an item (along the lines of a bronze short sword), and a second quest.  (faction results: +Steel Warriors, +Guards of Qeynos, -Corrupt Qeynos Guards, -Freeport Militia, +Knights of Truth).<br><br>[5] The 2nd Quest:  He wants you to go hunt down  '...a [second escaped gladiator]'  Fine, sounds easy... nope.  He wants you to return the shackles of the Minotaur Hero of the Steamfont Mountains.  <br><br>[6] Go get em and bring em back.  The hero's placeholder is the minotaur slaver in the front of the minotaur cave.  When he dies, there is a chance that the Hero will spawn on the other side of the valley.<br><br>Minotaur Hero + Shackles = Hero Bracers. </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This quest IMHO is one of the best ingame :)<br>I am a high elf Paladin, and purely from a roleplaying point of view its great, but you get a damned nice item as well. I have so far done the quest 6 times and counting :)<br><br>I first did my faction for steel warriors by gnoll teeth - like 500 of them - still wasnt enough, but nice side effect being get ally to Halas guards etc :)<br>Then I did the kobold hides quest, much better faction improvement for steel warriors, plus killing the kobolds gives good faction with erudites :)<br>Nomala quest-Blurred map quest- I'd say dont bother, too hard/long do them whilst on the way to warrens for the kobold hides quest but otherwise I dont see much point.<br>As to faction needed- you CAN do it at AMIABLE, but it must be HIGH Amiable. When I was first amiable Graham would NOT give me the quest, but after doing the kobold hide quest (5 backpack fulls of hides) a few times, although I was still amiable he DID give the quest.<br><br>Neways, to the camp- I have popped Hero 6 times so far longest took 6 hours, shortest took 1 hour.<br>Honestly dont think there is ANY way to speed up his spawn I think its purely random (ala AC spawn)<br>Having said that it does SEEM that if you butcher everything in the area repeatedly during camp he has popped somewhat quicker but might just be coincidence, certainly killing Mino lord and/or Necro has NO effect on Hero spawn.<br><br>Whilst camping the PH (which is the first mino slaver in the tunnel) you can keep busy by doing lotsa stuff which makes this not to bad a camp even if it takes many hours.<br>1- Kill the minos in the caves behind- They drop axes which sell for plat or are good for newbies. I give them to newbie melees in gfay :)<br>They also drop gold sometimes, and mino horns which can be handed in two at a time in akanon for good faction hits to the little gnome behind library. The minos also have a nice faction hit + gnomes :)<br>2- Kill rogue clockworks- They drop black boxes which can be handed in at Akanon, also scrap metal which can be handed in 4 at a time in Akanon, for small coin reward, faction, small xp. Also killing these is SUPPOSED to help trigger the spawn of Nilits clockwork which drops the gnome toy which is needed to complete the kerran toy quest, nice range item for mellee classes. I have spent 40+ hours at mino camp however and have only ONCE ever seen Nilits spawn. It is very rare indeed and talking to the inventor seems to have no effect on its spawn at all.<br>3- Kill EVERYTHING around caves in an attempt to get MIST elementals to spawn, their rare drop is Swirling mists which is a much sought after component in HIGH level cultural smithing- I have seen smiths offering 20pp each for these. There are also several ground spawns at mino cave area of components which are needed in tradeskills- pick these up too they might come in damn handy for someone :)<br><br>Happy camping!<br><br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Fri Dec 14 08:22:06 2001</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Knight of Tholuxe Paells</td></tr>

The catman quest blows, isn't required to get a bracer, and doesn't give any special amount of faction to make it any better than milk or gnoll teeth.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I'm doing the hero bracer quest, and i guess i got really lucky, the best thing to do I guess is for the Mino hero get to the camp kinda late and ask the person (if there is one) how long they hvae been camping the quest, if its been at least 6-7 hours ask them to send you a tell when they are finished. Now I dont know if that really works but I went to SF to camp the hero and there was a guy camping it who had been there for 6 striaght hours. He let me take the camp and almost exactly 1 hour after I took over I got the shackles. For the key I don't know what to tell you about Nomala spawn, I just went to the island and killed em got the key, sorry have no suggestions for that. But what I need to know is will amiably faction to SteelWarriors be enough for the quest, I was apprehensive and now I'm almost amiably, lthough now every guards in East and West FP haet me now, NFP love me though, thats what matters. But can it be done with just indifferent? I sneaked behind him and he still wouldn't say anything to me and told me just short of get lost. Anyone know for sure?<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Really takes the fun out of EQ.  it's bad enough we spen alost three weeks getting shackles from mino hero (another joke) and getting faction up with SW, but this is supposed to be a game, not a test of patience!!!!

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey all.  Had a bad experience today.  After camping Namala for 12 hours I finally got the key. I'm a druid helping a fellow guild member get hero bracer.  After my excitement of getting the key I teleported to NK and continued my journey to SQ.  <br><br>When I opened my inventory to turn in key, it wasn't there!  It poofed.  I made no stops during my trip to SQ, so I couldn't figure it out.  After going thru the typical q&a with a guide, they transferred me to a GM.<br><br>I retold the story to the GM and he/she went thru the logs and came up with nothing!  NOTHING!  I don't get it.  They said that it wasn't in the log files so they could help me out.<br><br>I have a rollplaying website I've been working on (nothing up yet) and I've been documenting alot of the quests that I do and put a story behind them.  So I had a screenshot of me getting the key.  I'm sure it wont hold its weight, but I sent it to the two email addresses that the Guide had given me to report my problem to if a GM wasn't able to get to me before I logged.<br><br>So here I am again, checking on Namala every 85 minutes (seems to be right about there for spawn), in hopes that I'll get a key before 12 hours are up this time.  Everyone wish me luck.<br><br>Regards,<br>Travlyn<br>40th Druid<br>Veeshan<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Don't sit down next to them to "wait" until they are done. You might be waiting a long time and then the time it takes for you to complete your camp on top of that. The NPC will always respawn and will always be there. Just ask them kindly if they will send you a tell when they are done and 9 times out of 10 they will. These players are tired from camping that long of a period and quite understandably a little grouchy and become extremely nervous at the thought of someone possibly stealing their kill.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey all, 45 wiz here - just wanted to let you all know how I did quest, in case some of you need some help with it.<br><br>First of all, you have to have amiable faction with the Steel Warriors.  Even to do some of the faction parts of the quest you have to have this lvl of faction with them.  You can do this several ways.  Here is what I did.  I went and coned the warrior in Qeynos - I was indifferent.  I went and did escaped catman quest, killed the kitty and brought the key back to warrior in guild.  But did not get any xp or faction for it.  So if he does not tell you where the catman is at, dont bother, you wont get xp for it.  It was a waste of time.<br><br>So I was off to wc, killing orcs and collecting belts.  I had a group wanting to hunt them, so I gave them the camp, and just rooted them, so I would get the faction hits.  They gave me all the belts.  Did this for about 2 hours, or so.  Went over to Hixpin, next to lake fishing - he is the one sitting down.  I tried giving him milk at indifferent too, guess what?  No xp or faction.  But after two hours of killing orcs, I now coned amiable.  Turned in belts to the pally in Freeport.  Then bought 200 milks, and gave them to Hixpin at WC lake.  He gets up and runs after some dude, when you give him the milk.  I was able to give him several times before he got up and ran after the guy.  So I would just sit down and wait for him to come back.  After about 200 milks, I coned amiable to Hixpin and warmly to the Steel Warriors.  But still not KOS to the Freeport militia - they cant stand me, but not much.  Doubiously - one step above KOS. It seems that to get Steel Warrior faction up, you lower it with the Freeport Militia. <br><br>So now that im warm to the warrior in Qeynos - I head out to Steamfont to hunt the Hero.  I get there several times, and its camped.  Oh well, no biggie.  After two tries, I go back a third time, during the day - and no one is there, only 3 people in zone.  So here is what I do.  Sit in front of the cave, when the first mino slaver pops, I snare him (Bonds of Force), then pull him out of the cave - then root him.  Blast him with Ice Shock (tried Inferno Shock, that wont kill them in one blast).  Right when he dies, turn around, and run across the yard - just east of the big metal sprocket.  The Hero will pop right next to a tree.  He will spawn immiadetly after you kill the slaver.  Or he wont,and you will have to wait for Ph to spawn again.  First time, I was looking at the wrong place for his spawn point.  I killed Ph, and did not see him - so I sat down and began to med.  All of a sudden, you are hit my Mino Hero, you are slashed by Mino Hero;  im like, what the heck.  I turn around, try to root him.  He hits hard.  I only have about 900 hp at lvl 45.  He hits for 90 max, so you can see, I wont last long meleeing him, lol.  So I finally get him rooted, then snared, then he dies - really fast.  Did not resist any DD spell, he went down in 3 shots of Conflag - 610 each pop.  Loot the bracer, pretty happy.<br><br>So I give camp up to someone who was waiting for it, and I asked him to please tell me when he leaves, because after I turn in bracer to warrior in Qeynos, I want to head back and camp him again.<br><br>Sure enough, as I am turning in the bracer, I get a tell, and he just killed the Hero again.  Sweet, so I gate back to gfay.  Run over there, and guess what.  I kill the ph, and Hero pops again.  Wow - 3 times in about an hour.  It was a good day, and very lucky day.  All these quests in EQ are all about luck, or stupidity - I camped the AC in OOT with friend, for 33 hours.<br><br>Good luck to you all, hope this information helps.  The bracers are going to my 31 ranger and my 21 bard, I might go back and do the quest for cash next time.  It helps alot knowing exactly where he pops at, if you do like me, and wait for him, if he has already poped, he will jump you, and hurt you - he can hit hard.  I thought I was done for first time, had a bugger of a time getting him rooted, kept interrupting me.  But once he was rooted, then snared, he was toast.<br><br>Later all, and once again, good luck.<br><br>Philibus Sophisticus<br>45 Wiz (ATM), Sons of Hate  :op<br>Bertox <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I just killed the mino hero (havent gotten good enough faction to turn it in yet). What I did was I sat a bit inside the cave, at the first slight bend, facing the PH spawn point. I would kill the PH, but my friend told me the hero popped near the gears, so about a spawn time between pops, I would start checking my tracking for a Minotaur Hero. Sure enough, I killed a PH, but it hadnt been very long before I was hit by the hero, again... max 90. He resisted ensnare twice (38 druid) but didnt do too good at resisting my dd spell Fury of Air, which is resisted quite often by other mobs. I just cast fury of air to stun, then started casting root with my warden symbol of tunare (clickable grasping roots). I then proceeded to DOT him with Drones of Doom, and continued the process, medding while not casting. Overall this was an easy kill, he seemed to not have TOO many hp, but still quite a bit... my estimate is between 1000 and 1500hp, but thats just from memory. Anyways, good luck with this quest, and if you dont find the hero, the hero will find you!<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi All, and especially to fellow rangers.<br><br>This is the best way i found to get the faction you need without even travelling to WC/FP, i just ran from South Qeynos to B-Burrow to Everfrost to Halas. I did this as a Lvl 34 ranger, since any less would be asking for trouble when trying to take down the mino hero (lvl35) solo.<br><br>I started on faction work (prior to this i had done nothing out of the usual hack and slash to build SteelWarrior faction) abt 1 day ago and now i am able to get the "What second escaped gladiator" quest.<br><br>1)Started in Qeynos, and didn't want to waste time/money getting ported around to check if the milkman guy (Mojax) would accept the 1000milks i had the intention of bringing to him. However i do know that you need to have high amiable KnightsOfTruth faction with Mojax before you can get the secondary faction hit for SteelWarriors.<br><br>2) Ran over to BlackBurrow, and informed the newbies there that i was Gnoll Fang hunting and that i would kill anything that so much as smelt funny. If they wanted a particular spawn just tell me and i would leave that one alone. So i spent about 5 hours in Blackburrow, getting gnoll teeth and avenging the transgressions and trains that killed this ranger in his pre-teens. After 5 hours straight, i had 2 gnoll hide lariats, 1 blackburrow Cask, 2 Blackburrow Skins, 8 Blackburrow Pelts, 13 Studded collars, 2 Spiked Shoulderpads, 8 Onyx Earrings, 7 Spiked Collars, 1 Runed totem Staff and 96 gnoll teeth. After distributing the drops at random to passing newbies, and making the entire sub level 10 population of Everfrost/Halas smell like Gnoll, i made my way to the Lady in the Halas PvP Arena. Gave her 3 at a time.....from Apprehensive i went to Indifferent. Wow big deal.<br><br>3) So i was kinda disappointed, and on my way out i hailed this Dargon chap. He asked if i was a [Wolves o' the North], and i said to him. "I am a Wolf of the North."<br>He then asked if i wanted to deliver a warming elixir to the freezing guards around everfrost and i said "I will assist you in delivering an elixir to young warriors."<br><br>4) He gave me the elixir, and told me to give it to the guy just inside the EF zone, before going down the ramp, this guy with 2 gals selling sewing stuff and whatnot.<br><br>5) I gave the Elixir to him (+MerchantsOfHalas, +ShamanOfJustice, +WolvesOfTheNorth, +SteelWarriors) and he told me to look for the dude that is SnowFlake's trainer. (he is the one standing next to the tree with snowflake by his side and with 2 higher level guards)<br><br>6) Gave it to that guy(same faction hits), and he told me to go look for Arnish McChicken or something like that. He is the running around naked 'cept for a kilt and when you Hail him he says he is cold (i wonder why) and needs to keep running. Anyway i gave the elixir to him, and same faction hits, and he told me to go look for Meagan O'riley, so off i go.<br><br>7) I got there, and 3 snow leopards were busy having Meagan for lunch. she died before i could even try to help. Oh well. Passed my time waiting for her to spawn, killed Redwind, Icy Orcs,etc. Finally she spawns and i give it to her, and same faction hits. She finishes the bottle and apologises if i had needed any for she drank it all. Told me to bring it back to Dargon in Halas.<br><br>8) So i bring it back to that Dargon chap, and he rewards me with the same faction hits (for a grand total of 5 times to merchants, wolves, shaman and steelwarriors) and some chump change (below 5gp total) and 1 useless-to-me-at-level34-rusty-dagger.<br><br>9) So anyway, he was Indifferent to me before the quest started and i conned him after. Amiable? Wowies. But it was late and i had to sleep so i waited till next day to try it.<br><br>10) New day, i log in and did the quest again. and again. and again and again. I did it about 8 more times. Somewhere in the 2nd time i jumped from Amiable to Kindly, and on the 8th time when i conned i was a Warmly. So now these guys love me more than my Surefall buddies. Each journey, with SoW only takes abt 10mins, including zoning time. But after the 2rd Journey i was itching to fight... so i added another step in this quest.<br>After talking to Arnish, and going to see Meagan take 20-30mins to hunt mammoths or Matar Icebear. I kept all my mammoth tusks coz i wanted to wait till my faction was as high as possible before selling. Anyway to cut a long story short, by the 8th time, i have 21 Mammoth tusks in my bank and 3 cloaks of the Icebear from Matar. All this i did while doing faction work.<br>Anyway, by the end of 4hours of faction building, i sold each tusk at 10pp for a total of 210pp+change, and managed to sell all 3 CloakOfTheIceBear at 80pp each for 240pp, earning me 450pp in 4 hours for supposed faction building. Pretty neat huh? Of course, this works best when you're a ranger.<br><br>11) After that i bummed a TP to Steamfront, where i camped the Mino Hero for abt 40mins before he popped. <br>You may say "Nonsense, this guy is talking crap! Mino hero is 35 and this ranger is 34! No way in heck the ranger will beat up the Mino Hero"<br>Well, kinda right. I started the battle with 100% health and 80%Mana and Skin like Rock, Feet like Cat, Strenght of Earth, Barbcoat, ThistleCoat and Firefist and Spirit of Wolf. Let's just say i pumped about 150 arrows into him, and bow kited him all over Steamfront. That brought him down to abt 1/3 life, together with 3 StingingSwarms and a few Ignites thrown in for good measure. I entered the battle at 100%life and 20% mana, and left with zilch mana and 2bubs of life let. He got lucky with 2 double 80's in a row the damned Mino. So i grab his shackles and i am now the proud owner of Green Plate look Hero bracers... which go nicely with my Ivybracers.<br><br>Go Go Norrath Rangers! :)<br><br>&nbsp;<br>35 Ranger<br>Xev</td></tr>

Watch tv or something between spawns cause you'll hear him snorting when he pops.  Drop a bomb on his head and then hit track or run out to see if hero is there.  Rinse and repeat.<br><br>Qeynos, I've found, gets tricky after doing the quest once or twice.  The corrupt guards dun like ya much.

I had alrady bought four stacks of milk at one of the inns in EC, expecting to finally finish this quest - I've already got the key and shackles. But when I tried to talk to the guy, I couldn't get him to give me a quest for love or money. Hailing him gets you no bracketed words, and after trying a bunch of things, I finally came across 'what job?', at which point he rattles off some more stuff about [Antonius Bayle] and [Qeynos], and if you ask him about either of those he just says (more or lesS) "How could you never have heard of qeynos/antonius??? Have you been living in a cave???"...I can't seem to get him to give me a quest! Somebody help me out here!<br><br>-Kethkol &lt;Mark of Honor&gt;<br>35th Ranger of Tunare, Ayonae Ro<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, listen up. I found the easiest way to get faction for this quest is to just do the steel warriors initiation quest. It is extremely easy, and it made my faction amiable (enough to do the quest) when it was indifferently before. And another thing is, if you don't get good enough faction the first time around I THINK (key word "THINK") you can just do it again for more faction. And here's a tip for getting the hero to spawn. Me and my friend killed the place holder/spawn triggerer for 2 hours, and nothing happened. But then we tried this strategy, and he popped the third time we killed the place holder/spawn triggerer. Here's the tip,<br><br>If you go right from the entrance of the minotaur caves and follow the wall until you get to the intersecting wall (will be a left turn), once there, follow that wall until you get to a little hill with a tree on it, that tree is where the hero spawns. The place holder/spawn triggerer is a minotaur slaver, however, minotaur slaver <br>( without the "a" at the beginning, and yes, there is a difference)sometimes pops too. But you have a much better chance of spawning the hero if you kill the "A minotaur slaver" which spawns about 10 or 20 paces into the cave, next to a pillar on the left side of the cave. He spawns once every 6 minutes and 10 seconds. When the slaver pops, --PULL HIM OUT NEXT TO THE HERO'S SPAWN POINT--, don't ask me why this works, but it does speed up the spawn rate drastically. Have fun guys, hope this has been helpful.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yes, you can do this quest when you are amiable. But here's the deal. WHen I started my lvl 1 warrior who would be handing in the shackles, he was amiable to rothgar, and he still didn't give him the quest. But when I handed in my recruitment letter to the guild leader, my faction went up with steel warriors, and although I was still amiable to rothgar, he gave me the quest. Here's the easiest way to do this quest(if you don't already have high-amiable or ally faction)<br><br>1.) Start a new Human Warrior in Qeynos. Have him turn in his recruitment letter to the guild leader, and then he will have good enough faction for the quest.<br><br>2.) Go down to the basement of the arena (take a left as you enter and you will see a little clearing in the wall with a ramp leading down) and hail Grahan Rothgar. He will say have you heard about [the escaped catmen], but ignore that, and just say "What second escaped gladiator" and he will tell you to get the mintotaur hero's shackles from steamfont mountains.<br><br>3.) Camp your new warrior right next to Grahan Rothgar and log in with whatever character your using to kill the hero. Go to Steamfont Mountains and kill the Minotaur slaver in front of the cave. NOTE-- THE SLAVER IS NOT THE HERO'S PLACE HOLDER -- Killing the slaver is the way to trigger the hero's spawn. This doesn't mean he will spawn everytime you kill the slaver, but after you kill the slaver, go check on the other side of the valley to see if you have triggered the hero's spawn. If not, keep trying till you do. It took me about 6 times of killing the slaver before the hero spawned, but once the hero spawned, he was yellow to a lvl 33. Me and my 46 buddy took him easily, and I think that with my lay hands, I might have been able to solo him (maybe). He dropped the shackles when I killed him, but I am not sure if the drop is definite or not. But if he drops the Minotaur Hero Shackles, head back to Qeynos.<br><br>4.) Once in Qeynos, go back to Grahan Rothgar, and do either one of two things.<br>a.) find a safe place to drop the shackles ( and THEY AREN"T NO DROP! I KNOW, I DID THE QUEST THIS WAY) and log back in with your new warrior to pick them up, or<br>b.) Find a trustworthy friend to hold the shackles for you and then give them to your warrior.<br><br>Either way, once your warrior has the shackles, have him turn them in to Grahan Rothgar for the hero bracers.<br><br>Remember folks, this is only the easiest way to do the quest if you don't already have high-amiable, warm, or ally faction with Steel Warriors, I suggest you just make sure you don't already have good enough faction for the quest. Have fun guys, and get rich. 8)<br><br>Treno Shadowbuster &lt;Wolves of the Tundra&gt;<br>33rd Paladin of Saryrn<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Sorry, if you were only lvl 33 you would not be able to solo him unless you are twinked beyond belief, If you are a pally or warrior i would not recommend trying to solo him until lvl 36 at the earliest, as a 35 pally i have tried to solo him twice both times after rooting, then healing myself with spells to full and also using LOH after that i got him down to 1/4 health.... a hit or two away from getting him to run but the first time he killed me, the seconded i opted to run a live to fight another day, so in conclusion if you are a meleer such as a pally that gets No DD or any kind of dmg spells do not attempt to solo until 36+, if you are a mage or a meleer who can snare and cast dmg spells then you could solo ealier probably 33 or so, he only has approx. 1100hps but he hits very hard a max of 90 and when your going toe to toe with him, that adds up really quick.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
