	   <tr><td colspan=2>The heartsting telson with poison-<br>This component is fairly easy to get because heartstings are low level and will always drop a telson, the problem is there are 2 types of telsons, one with, and one without poison, however both are lore items and if you have one you can not have the other, so before plucking the telson be positive it is the one you need. its fairly easy to tell the difference, the telson with poison will have the effect of poison bolt, this is the one you want. The other telson will just be a waste of time and space if you try to use it in your component bag, find this in the field of bone.<br><br>The Scalebone femur-<br>You cant miss this one, easiest of the 4 components carried by Greater Scalebones.  It identifies as "a cracked femur" but i assure you that it is the correct component and you can usually find a dozen of them lying around in kurns tower on corpses.<br><br>The Brutling choppers and Creeper cabbage-<br>I camped both of these boys for days at the above locations and never came across any, however thats not to say they dont spawn there, i just never seen one there.<br><br>i found the brutling at appx. 1600, -1800 as i was passing through with my shaman on the way to the GF and tossed a few nukes on him and made a fast camp and a haul butt trip with my necro to get my intact brutling choppers.  i have seen a brutling corpse in this area before right on the main trail from FOB to the GF where the trail to the goblin fort intersects.<br><br>the creeper which i found at appx. -1800, 2600 appeared to spawn after i knocked knuckles with a froglok tuk shaman right next to me, conned blue to me at 16 but didnt drop the cabbage.  5 minutes later i offed another froglok tuk shaman and in the same fashion a creeper spawned within my sight and my no mana half-dead self and my near dead pet started whaling on it, this one conned white and killed us, but as i got back to my corpse he was in the area and was a quick tango and dropped his cabbage.  For the record so there is no mistake the cabbage IS a meal and can be eaten, so it might be a good idea to carry your component sack 3/4 full and plenty of food and water so youre not re-doing this portion of the quest, or quickly making it to the bank to preserve this invaluable veggy.<br><br>After combining these items in your compnent bag it will seal itself off, return that with youre 3rd rank skullcap to Master Kyvix in the tower of death and you'll get your darkbinder.<br><br>Just a note FYI... I was hoping since the 4th rank of necromancer was the end of your "appreniship" so says Master Kyvix that it would have a different, more sophisticated and experienced look to it past the apprentice skull caps but was sadly dissapointed, so dont be suprised when your hard work and accomplishment leaves you looking like a newbie all over again.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I managed to find two brutlings after a lot of looking and eventually having help from a druid who had tracking. The first brutling was in the valley as described below around loc neg 1900, pos 2500 (middle of the valley). I stood there for quite a while (few hours) and saw a few other skulking runtlings but no brutlings. With a druid's help we found some pygmy brutlings (which are blue dangerous to level 21) near the iksar camp that's west of the giant fort along the path. We killed a couple of those. The pygmy brutlings had intact pygmy choppers, but I don't think those are the right items. Not sure if it's related, but we then found a brutling who seemed to be stuck with some goblins around loc neg 1210, pos 4050. It's hard to see anything with all the damn trees around there, but there was about 4 or 5 mobs seemingly stuck there between some trees. One was a brutling. Be careful though cause the gobs will gang up on you. Luckily the 2nd brutling had an intact chopper. The druid had also gone around killing any runtlings on track which may have helped. <br><br>BTW, I found the creeper cabbage on a man-eating creeper in the swamp of no hope around loc pos 2730, pos 730. I spent about 6 hours in that general area around the spire and saw two creepers. The first was beyond the spire and the 2nd at the above loc. The 2nd one had the cabbage. <br><br>Good luck. <br><br>Sivas <br>26th Season Necro from Morell Thule <br><br> <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I camped the spot for 5 hours each day for the past few days.  Last night I was a bit frustrated, so I grabbed my ranger, and started looking.  My tracking skills are up to 105.  I searched all over the zone, and could not find one.  I finally started tracking a brute in the hopes that it would lead me to a brutiling.  I tracked the brute only to discover that it was bugged, and located under the world!  I petitioned, and the GM located 30 mobs stuck under the world.  I logged back on with my necro, hopeing that it would spawn correctly.  Waited another hour, before switching with the ranger.  Once again, I tracked many mobs under the world.  Tried petitioning, and waited an hour before giving up.  Does anybody think this is just a problem with XEV, or is this something that happens on all the servers??<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Uhg.  I absolutly hated this quest.  I tryed at 14-15 to complete and my advice is to wait.  I waited till 22 went back took out my aggresion wiping out the areas i had died at level 14 looking for the things. Here is my advice<br><br>Telson: yeah yeah mentioned already.<br><br>Femur: The only thing about the post related to this part was that ever where it just says femur, the femur in quest is called a "Cracked Femur"  I was skeptic about it when i pushed the combine button do to the sensativity towards shattered and intact choppers.  The Cracked Femur works and is what your supposed to have.<br><br>Cabbage: At 14 I gathered shadows and ran through the whole damn zone, died once or twice due to underwater skeles I didnt see, but saw me.  I never once saw a creeper until i came back at 22 went to the thrid(forth maybe? cant remember) the one with the 3 pillars right beside the path straight out from cabilis, path ends on this island too.  I looked around the 3 pillars for like 10 min right after getting 22 and there was one just sitting on the hill off to the right.  He was green but just to make him pay for my trouble I blasted the hell out of the flower. No pet, every dot, rapid succesion siphon lifes.  No problem, except he didnt drop the damn cabbage.  I was pissed, went and looked around the entire zone shadowed for about an hour, then in the middle of nowhere i saw one all by him self no mobs for miles, same thing beat the crap out of his aspen, again, no cabbage.  As if this quest isnt hard enough, that the have to make the rare spawns loot uncommon.  Called it a night after that, next day went back to the three pillars, got jumped by a skele and then a gaz shaman after i lost invis, no pet, was an interesting fight, came out of it with about a bub of life and mana.  Gathered some shadows and sat down to rest, right as i did i saw a flower in the distance, got back up targeted, creeper.  Followed invis, very carefully, he stoped and i pulled a trick mentioned in someone elses post here.  Turned my sound way up and sat right by him so i could here if he moved.  got halfway healthy and he took off, followed him around some skeles, next stop was a a clearing by the iksar head on the ground, and this time i just use one dot a few siphons and slowly beat him to death with my staff, prolly made no diference how i killed him but i got a caggabe off the last one, put it in my last inventory slot so i wouldn't eat it and was very happy :)<br><br>Choppers: The valley that Sathis refers two is where i found my skulkings, once again came here at 14-15 never saw one, came at 22 just as i got there i started to talk to a friend and saw a monkey, thinking it was a runt i targeted and it was a brutling.  Got up started to give chase and another one walked right infront of me.  Uh-oh which one, going opposite directions.  One was going down into the valley one was going laterally accross.  Logic would dictate that i follow the one that would go out of sight first, well it was late logic didnt take.  I killed the one going down into the valley and got shattered choppers, and i couldnt find the earlier seen one.  So i went back to the place and after 5 min again saw two, this time i killed the one going out of the valley, got intact choppers, came back killed the one going into the valley, got shattered.  Wonder if the intact holder always walks a different route then the other, shrug might be usefull.  The spawn point has got to be close to that valley though cause one minute all i saw was a bonecaster, then instantly there where two brutlings came out of noiwhere, im tempted to think that is the spawn point and if you see the come and go they might just be rewalking their path, shrug.  <br><br><br>Good Luck everyone, I got 22 right after patch day, so it might have made it easier to find the spawns.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

It took me bout an hour to find this guy after crisscrossing all over the swamp...now the real pain was the skulking brutling...i spent probably close to 20 hours in warslik woods checking every spot posted here and in the listing on the creature and at lvl 20 everything in the area just about was green to me and me and my pet musta slaughtered hundreds of bonecasters, hunters, witchdoctors, battlemasters ect for hours on end and finally after selling(i had almost 1000 copper and 750 silver that i needed to bank to show how much crud i cleared)i stoped at the giant fort to kill a sapling and got jumped by a bonecaster and then what should wander over the hill behind the fort but a brutling an he droped the choppers intact and that was the only one i have seen in the whole zone period...just wanted to mention it as yet another place to look for em but that was the only one i've seen there or anywhere...found 9 runtlings and one brute in all the areas i checked...also if you try to clear the spawn stuck on the wall by the bandit lake round neg 1125 pos 4270 be careful as there can be tons stuck there and pulled a nice half dozen critter train the first time and got slaughtered at lvl 20 by all the greens...hope this helps someone as this quest is aweful hard for the lvl of the critter and reward but i got my dark binder skullcap...good luck all<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, I got this quest done at lvl 20 today.  The telson and femur were dead easy, of course, and I've been sitting on those for 8 or more levels.  The choppers and cabbage were more inline with the damned escaped froglok slaves from the previous quest.  Huge ass thanks to Sathiss for the loc of the skulking brutling.  It's a biatch of an area to solo, as whenever you med, you get jumped, but it worked.  Got the choppers from the first bruteling I found.  Sathiss's loc for the creeper seems to be more of a pathing bug that creatures will get hung up in.  Everytime I checked there, I only found some kind of mosquito that was yellow to me.  Tried to take it out, and nearly succeeded, but many of my spells were wasted as it was in the water and I was on land.  Grrrr....  At least I got my exp back by beating on the nearby forglok gaz knight on a 20 minute timer.  So then I check the area by the rogue iksar campfire with no luck.  By this time I had to log for the night and came back to check today.  I searched the area near -2700, 2700 to no avail and decided to return to the campfire.  I took out a couple of blues on the way and was low on mana when suddenly I see the creeper near the camp, and it was on the move.  I decided to follow it, as I didn't want to lose it while medding.  It walk a pretty straight line to the base of a pillar near 1300, 700 or so (didn't think to get the /loc).  I kept my sound up as I meditated so I could hear it walk away if it chose to.  Good thing too, because as I neared full mana, the creeper turned around and started heading back the way it came.  That may be it's standard patrol route...  Give it a try.  After killing it and getting the cabbage, I headed straight back to cabilis and found another creeper standing still at 1800, 1800.  It may be it's static location, or merely a spot on its patrol, but at least it's another place to look.  Good luck to everyone trying this.  Now I'm on to the next one (already have the pariah mask and I'll just ask people for the right to loot a no drop ivy band in WW).<br><br>Rovylern Shadeclaw - Broodling of Kotiz with 20 moltings, member of Armageddon on Brell Serillis<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Now I am not saying that the creeper doesn't spawn near the pillar to the left of town, but I hunted there at least once each level from 13-20, and never found it. Then last night a friend and I were hunting there when I saw a couple of soft skin females hunting in the same area. I asked them if they would give me a tell if they saw a man eating creeper. In unison they both responded, "Those are found in the South of the zone". I thought, really? That goes against everyting I have been reading here. Just about that same time, another friend of mine had zoned in and was going to join us. Well his sense heading skill seems to have been neglected, and he got lost. He said he was at -2700, 2700 roughly. I told my friend to stay at the pillar and keep an eye out while I went to fetch our friend. For those of you without a map in front of you, that is at the tail end of the path that leads out from the city to the south, past the first two islands. I went down to fetch my friend because he had run into trouble a couple of times when some frogloks had jumped him and had to feign. After gathering him up, I was going to head back to the pillar. When lo and behold a Man Eating Creeper crossed the path right next to the pillars, approx -2250, 2600. Killed it and it had the cabbage. I do believe that the creeper can spawn near the pillar, just very rarely. Judging from the response of the soft skins to my question, they made it sound that the creeper was a fairly common mob in the part of the zone I found it at. For the Brutling, I went to the spot that Seronami had given in his post (-2233.50, 2729.43), near the valley that Sathiss had referred to. I roamed around for a bit and was just about to give up when he popped up right in front of me. Killed him and he had the choppers. Interesting note though, he seemed to have two green conning goblin friends. As soon as I hit the Brutling, a caster goblin and a melee jumped me and my pet. My 16th level pet took on the melee goblin and brutling, while I took out the caster. That pet kicked some serious tail, and even though the caster was green, since our Cold Resist is pretty low, his Cold DD spells packed a wallop. I finished with 1/2 mana and health and the pet was at 1/2 health also. Kind of an exciting battle. They may have been just wandering by, but they got on me really quick. So keep an eye out for goblins in the area when you find him. Good luck, this quest was much more of a hassle than the previous one in my opinion.<br><br>Troy<br>Kreliss Thekzul<br>20th Level Iskar Necromancer (Bristlebane)<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I got a location for the skulking brutling a friend grabbed the 8 goblins which was protecting a skulking brutling on the hill by the bandit lake and chased them to me, I killed the bruteling finding out he dropped the shattered choppers.

That is the exact location I found him. He is the one that drops the intacted choppers.  Skulking Brutlings are the ONLY choppers you can use.  No Pygme Brutes or anything else like that.  Just Skulking Brutling.  Rumors are that they fall under the world so petition a GM to check up on this.  If you still have a hard time finding them, see if you can get a Ranger or Druid to track them down for you. <br><br>Also, the Man-Eating Creeper was easy to find for me as I got him within 5 min of entering the swamp.  Go straight and follow the trail to the left side.  Go half way down the trail and head off to the right.  Go straight til in the middle of the clearing and just wait.  He will come by all the time.  He walks from the island across the water but will come to this island and walk right by you.  I'll get the loc later.<br><br>Also, make sure the heartsting telson has a poison charge on it otherwise it won't work.  <br><br>And the scalbone femur drops off any Greater Scalebone.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Someone responded on EQ msg boards with the following tips.. <br><br>Actually these 2 mobs are quite easy to get. You just need to know where they spawn.<br>There are a lot of Kunark Quest mobs that operate this (Shaman have the 2 rouge shaman (on in WW ruins, one behind kurns, and the Undead Crusader in Kurns).<br><br>The trick is that very few people hunt in the Swamp or woods (except giant fort) and the spawn areas are not well mapped out, the placeholders are not killed and you have to wait forever.<br><br>The creeper spawn is on the bank 9not an island) in swamp right of town. it spawns at the pillars (the only ones that are on the shore (not islands) in that direction. Everything there is around 4-5 levels higher, and you can't solo the are until the creeper is green. The placeholder is a green common mob that spawns at the pillars and heads towards the FV one and back.<br><br>The Bruteling Spawns near bandit lake , waks kina towards town through the woods and back. There is a lot of bad pathing at the lake and the mobs that placehold for him (or him himself) often get stuck on the rock wall there. Again, the bruteling is lower than the goblins and other baddies in the area, also clearing wall-stuck spawns can be rough solo, as you can pick up a lot at the same time.<br><br>Basically, these aren't broken, just the zones were not popular enough for the spawn info to become readily available. K have leveled an Iksar Necro on several servers, never spent more than 2 hours on either of these, since.<br><br>-T<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I hunted the Skulking Brutling for 3 days (about 4 hours at a time) and had a very hard time of it, but I have learned some things.  Sathiss's posts on the locs neg 1750 pos 2156 and neg 1950 pos 2600 are quite good.  But I think a little clarification is in order.  Those to locs are the far sides of a narrow valley that runs west/east.  The valley is just past the river on the left side of the zone as you leave cabilis.  The Brutlings do occasionaly run through there but it is just a route that all the other runtlings take too.  I hunted for 3 days and only saw one in the valley, killed it, it dropped the broken choppers. ARG! so i got myself a ranger to help me track it (no self respecting iksar necro should be running around in the darn woods by himself anyway).  This is what we found out:  The Brutlings do indeed get stuck underground, if you've been looking for hours and haven't seen one, it's because it's stuck.  The mob actually isn't so rare, they just have a nasty habit of getting stuck.  Well fear not! If you are looking for this mob, go to location neg 425 neg 1120.  It's a little hill near the path where the brutlings ALWAYS get stuck, if you can target a AE at the hill you can get it to agro on you, then you kill it, then it will repop, go back to the valley and wait for it! (unfortunately you can't loot the corpse that's underground).  In the end I had to track the darn thing to that spot 3 times (logged on with my druid) unfortunately I could never find the darn things spawning point.  So eventually I waited untill patchtime, LO and BEHOLD, they were everywhere 3 of the suckers, killed the first one with my druid, then logged on quick with my necro to loot, badda-bing!  I realize that everyone doesn't have a lvl 29 character to do this with.  But this quest really is hard for a lvl 15 necro, get help!  Anyone who can track is a must.<br>&nbsp;<br>You don't know the power of the dark side.</td></tr>
