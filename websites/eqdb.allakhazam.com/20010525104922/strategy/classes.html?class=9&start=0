	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hi everyone,<br>A friend and myself are interested in pairing up from level 1... creation. I'm interested in making a Troll Shaman, and wondering what would the "best" (tongue firmly in cheek) partner for a Troll Shaman would be. <br><br>Here is a bit of background, sorry if it reads like a logic riddle-<br><br>I am partial to dark elves - especially shadow knights, though this might not be a big deal because I will probably be the one being the shaman. <br><br>If I am the shaman, I am certain my partner would prefer to be a melee class. <br><br>Should I be looking for 2 hybrids? Or should I be looking for 2 "straights"? Neither of us would want to be a Cleric, for instance. (again, since my partner wants to be a meleer). <br><br>Some of the combos I've been coming up with are:<br><br>Troll Shaman w/ DE Shadow Knight (shaman as range / healer / buffer) shad knight tanker w/both meleeing up front at first.<br><br>DE Necromancer w/ DE Shadow Knight (straight ahead rapage... bad thing would be the downtime & lack of healing between pulls, though the carnage time might make up for this?)<br><br>Trollie Shaman w/ ???????????<br><br>??????? Shaman w/ ???????????<br><br>Basically the whole gist of this is:<br>1. Not too much conflict with gear<br>2. Maximized killtime/downtime ratio<br>3. Longest amount of "fun" to be had before having to find a third.<br><br>Thanks in advance - <br><br>Frotteurist Bourreaux<br>DE Shadow Knight of the 24th<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I think a Troll Shaman groups well with any melee class. The only reservation I'd have about a Dark Elf Shadow Knight is the distance between Grobb and Neriak. Shamen can't bind until level 14 which means a long trip for someone if they die. Why not instead create a Troll or Ogre Shadowknight? This way your starting cities are either the same or nearby. Besides, though I have nothing against Dark Elf Shadow Knights, I can't see how they can tank as well as a Ogre or Troll. The only downside to both playing large races is that at very low levels you'll both be competing for the same patchwork/leather armor. Very soon, though, the melee class will move on to Bronze and better, which Shamen can't wear.<br><br>All in all, this seems like a fun and sound combination.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>  Have noticed the big argument here on Wisdom, and to a lesser extent AC.  I've got a lvl 34 Troll who I occasionally solo with, and he solos with two buffs on.  Sow and Regen.<br><br>  Malaise, Root, Disempower, Dot, Root if Dot broke root when cast, then cannibalize a couple times, sit and med.  med far enough away so that when the mob breaks root, you can stand and get a root attempt on it before it closes into melee range.  I kill blues easily with this method, and can kill whites and even the very occasional yellow if I can't find blues or whites.  I don't go after massive hp creatures though.  Your choice of a target is important.  I have 140 Wisdom, (and 2 +mana items, platinum tiara and moonstone ring)  I normally finish low blues with half mana/health, high blues with 2 bubs health/mana, and whites/yellows normally have me skinning the bottom of the barrel for mana.  Two thirds of yellows that I fight end up chasing my butt to zone, but I can get them now and then.  I never under any circumstance will melee when soloing - I do more damage with my mana from cannibalizing than I can do with melee combat during the same time frame required for me to lose an equivalent amount of hp.  Of course I am not optimized for AC, but neither am I optimized for mana.  At lvl 34 my equipment is borderline at best.  I have just gotten lvl 34 spells, and will experiment.  I believe the only change to my tactics will be that I will no longer root, as a rooted mob will kill my pet quickly.  The pet should be able to make up for lost mana due to non-meditation during root cycles, provided that I keep Scourge and Envenomed Breath running on mobs.  I might even experiment with Flash of Light to see if there is any useful effect to it when kiting.<br><br>  I can't claim any sort of expertise, nor uber equipment, but I can claim that what I do works.  Anyone who wants to come take a look, feel free to do so.<br><br>Allezoop,<br>The Rathe<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Beyong a certain point, FOR THE MOST PART, a high wisdom is just eye candy.  You try to come back and say AC and stuff is nice, but then turn around and say again and again, Wisdom is all that matters.<br><br>I am not going to get into a pissing match with you.  My guild did this, we did that.  You know, I seriously doubt anyone cares about who did what first.  Considering that Vox/Naggy/other dragon tactics have been out there much longer than your server has been in existence, it is not a big deal.  If you had been the first guild on an older server to kill something big, then I would have been impressed.<br><br>Yes, my mana drains when I cast spells.  Can't refute that logic *rolls eyes*  But I NEVER get the point where I endanger the group.  Where does the mana come from for the slows?  Let's see.  Um, meditating.  Cannabilizing.  Clarity or Clarity II.  A Bard playing the mana song.  A Lich Necro dumping mana.  As to medding more, Um, what is YOUR point?  Oh, I know, you melee.  Wheeee.  A Shaman = meditation, just like any other pure casting class.  Considering I never go OOM except on a gross overpull, how is you having 250 more mana (at 50 with 200 vs 175 wisdom for example) going to let you stand and chain cast more than that player?  You get one more slow spell with that extra mana, IF YOU MEDDED TO FULL.  I wouldn't turn it down, but it will not make or break me.<br><br>As to the max mana, it has NOTHING to do with how much you need to med.  Get it through your head.  In an established group situation, we will meditate THE SAME AMOUNT of time.  Why?  Because we cast the same spells, the same number of times, and use the same mana.  Do you really expect your group to wait on you to med to FOM each time after a pull?  If you do, well, I won't go there.  <br><br>"Yes, people are free to pay any race they want for any class that race is an option for, but as for you "loving" people who say, halfling druids are best, etc., well, ok, if you think they are not then you can't read a stat page and thats your opinion. "  <br>I can't read a stat page?  Gee, thanks, I am illiterate.  You tell me how halflings are so incredibly superior.  The 5 wisdom?  I think not.  Know your stats and you will see that that is the only area where they have an advantage &gt;that makes a difference&lt;.  Humans get 25 more CHA.  Charming for a human is a little easier if you are inclined to do that to break certain areas.  Does that make a human better?  No, but it certainly does not make them worse.<br><br>"But just because you apparently have a following here does not necessarily make you correct, and because there are different ways to play a Class that WILL work, does not mean their is not an OPTIMAL and BEST way to play it, nor an OPTIMAL and BEST race for a particular Class, it ust meands that yes, you can make it work."<br>Wow, you are an Everquest Game Designer now?  Brad told you all the inside stuff eh?  Noone can claim that their class/race choice is "OPTIMAL" or "BEST". Certain ones have, perceived or otherwise, advantages over other races.  But there is no "BEST" race.  All together now, there is no BEST race.<br><br>"Those are the facts and realities of it, and i guess if you want to believe otherwise then thats your perogative, but i don't appreciate you insinuating that i or anyone else for that matter do not know of which we speak because you have a "fan club" here at this site. "  <br>At least I do not make an entire post dedicated to alienating entire groups of players because I feel superior.  I do not have a fan club here.  People have read what I have posted, and rated me accordingly.  See my name in green?  That means, for the most part, what I have posted has been received positively.  Evidently, enough other players who read my stuff agree with me.  But, I am totally wrong, I bow to your superior knowledge.<br><br>Please, do not speak down to me.  When I have done this and that.  How do you know I haven't?  Because I am not Uber like you?  *snort*  What(pause)ever.<br><br>You also tell me where I said at 55+ 165 Wisdom was OK?  I said 40+, 165ish should be the &gt;floor&lt; for wisdom.  Any person who has played Everquest to any extent know that the ballgame changes after level 53 or so.  How many people do you think that ask about a low wisdom score will make it to 55+?  The comments were aimed at the people who ask, and will, more than likely, never see higher than level 51.<br><br>Looking back, I see where I said AC, hp, and resists don't matter.  /sarcasm off.<br><br> <br>"Yes, as you go from 50 - 60, this means more and more , especially after 55, half way gear don't cut it , half way players dont cut it, and halfway stats won't either. If you want to be the BEST, anyway. You want mediocre, then fine, if thats what you want." <br><br>You know, how many times does someone have to tell everyone that the person playing the character is much more important than equipment.  Great equipment helps, but a crappy player means it is worthless.  A good player works within his boundaries, and knows his limitations, whatever they may be.  5 points of Wisdom at creation (or 10 for an Iksar) are not going to make a huge difference at level 50.  That 100 mana means JACK when you start using 1500 mana in a fight later on.  Sure it helps, but it is not going to make or break you.  Say all you want, because it won't.<br><br>"But if less than the best is okay with you, then fine, i just hate you are seemingly trying to convince everyone else that half - azz is good enough."<br><br>If I wanted everyone to be "half azz(ed)", I would tell them to play Gnome Clerics.  You show me where, in ANY of my posts, I say it is OK to suck.  Show me where that I say Wisdom doesn't matter.  Show me where I tell someone that a 125 wisdom is OK at level 50.  All I have done is told the TRUTH.  If you do not have 200 wisdom, the world will not end. <br><br>"Nebulonn Darkevoid <br>35 Iksar Shaman <br>Drinal Realm <br>&lt;High Council of Norrath&gt; <br>192 WIS at lvl 35 "<br><br>You know, this is what gets to me.  You know everything, but yet you post that you have a 35 Shaman with a 192 Wisdom.  I bet that Shaman has earned it all, too.  You dare accuse me of not knowing what I am doing, yet you post here anonymously, then post your twink information.  I saw the 55 Shaman part, but when you then turn around and try to flaunt a twink, you lose any credibility in my eyes.  What is the matter?  Aren't you a good enough player to have a realistic wisdom stat at level 35 and still get the job done?  I guess having a 160 wisdom at 35 (which is more realistic) handicaps a player of your caliber, as you NEED that 224 extra mana to play your character.  Sure it helps, and I would not turn it down.  But for some reason, I think I could manage without. That is one extra Gheal and a buff.  Yeah, that's a nice bonus at 35.  But ONLY if you med to full.<br><br>I am done posting directly to you.  People can read my posts, and other's reactions to it and draw their own conclusions.  I never said once that you HAD to do something this or that way.  But by the same token, you should do the same.  Telling someone they do not know how to do something is a surefire way to make them not believe you.  I always take anonymous posters with a grain of salt, but for some reason, you came across in a not so great manner that I felt needed a response.<br><br>As I said, I am done posting directly to you.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>look here, i don't know about all these people saying they 125 WIS and are not having any trouble, if that is true, then they are either :<br><br> A. level 12 or under.<br><br> B. not doing their job.<br><br> C. Die an awful, awful, lot.<br><br> Let me see if i can make this clear to starting shamen. WIS EQUALS MANA.<br><br>         MANA = POWER<br><br> To the poster that said they are only ever at half mana so it doesn't matter, what a bunch of BALONEY. <br><br> Yes, it DOES matter, half of 100 for example is 50, with a low WIS index, half of 200 is 100,<br>with a HIGH WIS INDEX, even at half mana it is still DOUBLE the available mana of someone with a much lower WIS index!<br><br> Your goal, is to MAX your WIS at 200, then SLOWLY back off, to max your AC as much as possible, while retaining your WIS index of 200, or as close to it as humanly possible.<br><br> This requires a diligent and arduous search for the right pieces available in the game, but yes my friend, to a Shaman, WIS is king, and 200 is<br>your goal, after 40 if you dont have it, you are in for a world of hurt.<br><br> don't sacrifice a ton of AC for it, it can be done with a combination of the right pieces, but if you dont have at least 185 WIS or so by level 40, you are simply not going to be able to keep up, whether with canna , regen , and clarity or no, your TOTAL available mana pool will be so low at say 140 WIS that yoiur spell costs will be so high that to be effective your pull rate will have to be so slow before you go oom that no one will want you after you start slowing the groups pulls down , or even worse someone dies as a result of you going oom in a fight.<br><br> 200 WIS gives you your max mana pool at any given level, and it becomes increasingly important as you get higher, and anyone here or anywhere else who try's to tell you different is pulling your chain, clueless, or both.<br><br> Yes, in some situations you can get by with a lower WIS, but not below 185 or so past 40, and thats pushing it.<br><br> You are not a melee oriented player, you are caster oriented, and its kind of hard to cast with no mana, and low WIS equals low mana pool, is that clear?<br><br> Try this, take ALL you WIS gear off, and med to FULL. Then quickly put all your WIS boost gear back on, you should notice your mana bar drop WAAAAAY down, this represents mana gain, off your boost gear, which is your then, total available mana pool.<br><br> That means thats much more you can cast before going oom. When creating a shaman, you put EVERY POINT you can inti WIS it will let you, anything else, drop in stamina for HP.<br><br> Yes, if you didnt do this, you can maybe make it, but it ain't right, and it is not OPTIMAL.<br><br> Thats the way it is, and if anybody try's to tell you different, they are either just plain out wrong or trying to cover the fact that they created their character with crappy stats and are now trying to say it doesn't matter.<br><br> It does so matter, and the further along in game you go, the more obvious it will become if your total WIS index is way low.<br><br> Not trying to be a wise guy but thats the bare facts , go to any INT based caster board and try to sell them on the premise that 150 INT is as good as 200, and they will laugh you right off the Board, and just because Shaman have some limited tanking ability  and a  pet does not <br>change the fact that their / our primary role is a caster and to be the best you can at this requires you to have the largest mana pool you can get, and the way to do that is to obviously <br>have as high a WIS as you possibly can. <br><br> I hope all this is now clear to any people wanting to start a new shaman, and to the cluless wonder that downed iksar for a starting race because they were "weak" , you have got to be kidding me, high natural AC is a great asset, and high natural regen = constant mana  after 34 when you throw a regen on and the two effects "stack", then you use canna to convert regened HP to mana.<br><br> With the new Iksar armor drops in HATE , i'd be hard pressed to justify objectively anyone starting a shaman  that WASN'T iksar based solely on starting stats, not saying you CAN'T make another race work, but it wouldn't be OPTIMAL.<br><br> i love playing both my shaman and am trying to help, i cant believe some of the misguided info put up here, plse. people learn the FACTS about your Class and its attributes and abilities BEFORE creating one and if you didnt, well ,you <br>certainly are not the first one to have made that error,but please don't post here that "it don't matter", because yes, it DOES.<br><br> It is the difference between being good, and being the best. being most of what you can be, or being all of what you can be.<br><br>                Nebulonn  <br> <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yar, I'd have to concurr with both these guys on that point. We SHOULD have a high base of wisdom points (say 150-180) but by no means at all do we need 200 wis and I doubt that we'll ever get to use that much in one fight. There are some classes that need ultra-high wis/int points such as clerics and wizards because their job is strictly mana expensive and is NONSTOP casting in many situations. Shamans however are not meant to work in such a way, they assist, supervise, dot, and buff and inbetween get many a chance to throw in a few hits & regain mana/HP  through regen,cannibal,etc. We're a very balanced class as shamen with great highlights and lots of character that's what makes them the class to be for me, probably the only class I can stand to play for too long. Plus hey, at least playing a shaman takes more personal strategy than say, playin a warrior or a necro. There's no clear cut way to play a shaman it's very versatile so do what works for you but remember what the shaman's purposes and strengths are.<br><br>Annoc<br>Preist of Cazic Thule <br>Innoruuk Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Noone has claimed at 40+ having a 125 wisdom is not a big deal.  I happen to agree that 165 is the floor you should have by level 40 if at all possible.  However, your assertion that 200 wisdom is &gt;required&lt; is completely false. <br><br>*edit*<br>I believe I made the claim that I am seldom over *75m* in a group, and that it doesn't make a difference.  So I am full of it?  Whatever.  A huge mana pool is only good for three things.<br><br>#1) Camp break ins.  More mana= being able to control or recover a situation better.<br><br>#2) Soloing.  By the time you hit 40+ as a Shaman, if you are still soloing as your main means to gain xp, then be a Necromancer or Druid.  We are the spell caster equivilent of a rogue.  We can do OK by ourselves, but our effectiveness is multiplied in a group.<br><br>#3) Showing off.  Hey d00d, I have a 200 wis, +600 in mana gear, so I take 10 minutes longer to med to full than you, HAHAHAH.  *rolls eyes*<br><br>I guess I am "pulling your chain, clueless, or both".  You assertion that under 200 wis is not &gt;optimal&lt; is a joke.  Yes, it is nice to be able to swap in more Ac/hp/resist gear at higher level.  But unless you are someone who has made it to the point where all you do is raid, it is not the be all end all.  No, 150 wisdom is not as good as 200 wisdom.  Noone will argue that point.  But it is not 100%, you have to have it or you can't do your job, you SuX0r important.<br><br>I guess I should point out your optimal comment is essentially correct.  However, you use the word as if it is a requirement, not the ideal situation.<br><br>As to not being optimal if you pick a non iksar...  Whatever.  I love people who try to claim that one race/class combo is the only way to play.  It is like the Woodelf/Halfling Druid vs all the rest debate.  While they have a little more flexibility when it comes to swapping in and out gear, they start out with 5 more wisdom than a human.  Oh, no.  Human Druids have no chance of getting a 200 wisdom, they suck, don't play them.  Uh, oh, Half Elf Druids have no chance of getting a 200 wisdom, they suck, don't play them.  Built in regen is a wonderful thing, but it is not a must have item.<br><br>The only time that lower wisdom makes a difference is when you HAVE to swap equipment out for resists.  And the times this is important (read life or death) is the 55+ game.  As long as you can manage a 170ish (or higher) wisdom by level 40+, and still manage to crack the 800 AC barrier, you are absolutely fine.  Once you can raid and get the Uber gear, then worry about 200 wisdom.<br><br>And just to let you know, I run with a 185ish Wisdom at 51, and an 800+ ac as a Barbarian.  I have yet to "go oom that no one will want you after you start slowing the groups pulls down , or even worse someone dies as a result of you going oom in a fight."  How many times have you seen this?  Level 51 Shaman LFG.  What is your Wis?  185.  Oh, you Sux0r, you HAVE to have 200 wis, n00b33.<br><br>Do you even know what a shaman does at the higher level game?<br><br>#1) We token buff.  Stats are &gt;generally&lt; useless with a few exceptions.  But we buff everyone up because it makes them happy, and adds a minor amount of effectiveness. Our other buffs (speed, Tuna etc) or more important in general.  Read some of the more serious messege boards and you will see the experiments testing stats.  It is almost laughable.<br><br>#2)We slow the mob.  This is the #1 priority of a Shaman.  If we do NOTHING else in the fight, this is it.<br><br>#3) We root park.  This is more of a function of AC than wisdom...  And it only normally happens when the enchanter is either swamped with a bad pull, or you do not have an enchanter...<br><br>#4) We backup heal.  This includes regen type spells, and downtime healing.<br><br>#5) We keep the Cleric alive.  This is the #2 priority of a Shaman in a group.  Unless the Cleric has to aggro heal because of an icky situation, you Slow first, then watch the cleric's life bar.<br><br>#6) We keep the Enchanter alive.  Dead Enchanter= Dead party more often than not.<br><br>How much mana does this require?  Not a whole lot, at least not constantly.  We can get away with a lower mana pool because, when the chips are down (not buffing), we require LESS mana than just about any other class to have an impact.  We can spend less than 250 mana per fight (if specialization kicks in) for Turgur's Insects, not cast another thing, and everything is just fine.  If we can chip in with something else, great.  As any high level group will tell you,  that slow spell is the ONLY thing they want a Shaman for, it is our #1 priority.  75% slow is 1000 times more important than a 400 point nuke.<br><br>When mobs have 20k hp, nuking for 400 is just a sure way to get summoned.  Ebolt is almost a guaranteed way to get summoned also, especially after a slow spell.  Guess what, when you get summoned, that 200 wisdom does NOTHING for you.  AC and hp do.  They only reason you will live is because your slow spell keeps you alive in combination with your AC long enough for the tanks to taunt the monster off you.  Try emergency tanking a Frosticube in Icewell that quads for 220, and see how much good that 200 wisdom does for you.  And please, don't try to tell me that if you get aggroed, you aren't doing it right.  Getting aggroed is a way of life in the higher game.  Mob aggro 50+ is so screwy, you have a hard time avoiding it occasionally.  Sometimes, not matter what that warrior does, the monster just refuses to let go of you.<br><br>200 wisdom is a goal, not a requirement.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is either jerking your chain, clueless, or just trying to up the price of their wisdom gear the want to sell.  Or maybe all three.<br><br>Gorthin Spiritcaller<br>51 Shaman BB<br>188 Wisdom 800+ AC, and always did fine when his wisdom was in the 170's    <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>A shaman is the best class to play in my opinion even though I only made it to 28 then stopped might come back soon though but anyways. From the lower levels mainly 1-14 u can solo anything green,blue,even and if ur lucky or twinked probably a yellow. You can continue soloing levels 15-20 but once u hit 20 u should start grouping u earn more exp faster and again if ur lucky u might even make a great profit out of it. Once u hit level 20 or 21 try hunting Treants in a group in South Karana, faction can easily be solved by hunting another 500 gnolls in BB lol. After a while I think when u reach 24 or 25 u can start soloing treants or the Miller's in Qeynos Hills, good exp till 34. My last night in EQ was camping the Miller's had lots of fun there. Well if anyone remembers me my character was named Aerodin Czaran a level 28 barbarian shaman on the bertoxx server. Well thats just my 2 cents. Good luck to everyone on leveling and getting the stuff u want.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

I'm not familiar with the armor quests for Iksar shamen, but given your AC is not quite 500, you might want to look into them.<br><br>Hehehe  yea, not being hit is always cool, but you're going to get hit anyway, so you'd might as well be prepared for it if you can.  I would suggest you start doing some research via WWW to find out what you can do to boost your AC.  Good luck!<br>&nbsp;<br>Badjur Bravehartt<br>52 Mystic of Druzzil Ro<br>Tar Valon</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Okay, here's my advice:<br><br>You're probably way KoS in all parts of Freeport.  So here's what you do:  Get in on a couple of Lucan raids.  At level 50, you are certainly of sufficient level to do this.  Helping to kill Lucan (who is Freeport Militia) only lowers West and East Freeport faction.  Also, killing Lucan RAISES your faction in North Freeport.  Tthe pally guards in North Freeport just looove people who whoop ass on Lucan.   After a few raids on Lucan, you just might be non-KoS in North Freeport.<br><br>note:  Lucan is extremely magic resistant (if not 100% MR), so in order to get some of the faction hits, all you need to do is throw a heal to a single tank fighting him.  Trying to dot or nuke is just a waste of your mana.<br>&nbsp;<br>Badjur Bravehartt<br>52 Mystic of Druzzil Ro<br>Tar Valon</td></tr>

However most of the time your total wisdom is not that important.  In groups how fast you regain mana is more important than how much mana you have.  After you get canablize shaman can regain mana faster than most other classes.  While soloing AC and the damage your weapon does are very important as well.  When I solo my wis is 149 (lvl 49) and I have yet to run out of mana on something I can kill.  <br><br>There are two times when total wisdom is important.  1 When learning skills like tailoring. 2.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>No, Weissblau, this is not necessarily a huge mistake.  Being a dumbass and not knowing what I was doing, I didn't put a single point into wis when I started my shaman (my first EQ char ever)...so my base wis is 80.  I was maybe level 25 by the time I truly had a good understanding of stats, by which time I felt it was too late to start another shaman, so I labored on.  Even if you don't put extra points into wis, it IS possible to get your wis up to an acceptable level.  Sure, some high end items are required, but it can be done.  With velium jewelry, gebs, imbued ivory earrings, reed belt, crystallised shadow tunic, Tserrina's Talisman, howling harpoon, spine chill spear, CGS, mammoth hide cloak, tot helm, lizzie mantle, and RMB's, I've managed to get my wis to 175.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>  If you are in a group with more than one melee type, and there is a cleric for healing, I have found that (at least at lvl 30) it is possible to cast Affliction and Envenomed Breath on mobs that both melee types are working on.  The melees do enough damage most of the time to keep the mob from turning on you, but at the same time, you do significant damage to the mob, and keep it from regenerating during the fight.  If the melees drop the ball and miss a lot, even a low AC shaman can stand up to a blue or white mob long enough to cast root and get away, or let the melees taunt the mob off.<br>  DoT casting for a high AC shaman is a great way to make a rogue you are working with very happy as well - I've been in duos with rogues and between my DoTs and the rogue's backstabbing whenever the mob turned to attack me, we were quickly destroying mobs.<br>  When there is no bard/enchanter handy, DoTs also work well to keep extra mobs from assaulting your cleric when he heals the Melee types.  DoT and Root.  When the cleric heals, there is a good chance that the mob will not go after him as root breaks, since you put the DoT on it to make it mad at you :)<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I agree with what you say and would like to add to it.  If you need to taunt the mob for some reason, dot it and then heal a group member.  That will instantly send that mob running to you.  Also healing or doting and then sit to meditate will make them run to you if you are not too far away.<br><br>When I parter with just one other person or maybe two people depending upon the makeup of the group, I will just usually use my poison dot and not bother with the diesease dot.  More than likely, the melee will go quick enough that only the envenomed breath will complete its damage quickly.  Affliction will usually not finish its damage before the melee is for.<br><br>In a full group setting, I never cast dots unless it some really bad arse mob that is super red (and even then, it is most likely resisted).  Generally with other casters and tanks on the same mob, it will go down pretty quick and your poison dot would probably not even finish.  It just doesnt seem mana efficient.  Instead I will either debuff or DD in battle and back up heal or be main healer.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have another use for DoTs in groups.  I usually act as the designated "root parker" if we pull multiple non-casters - I attack the NON-primary target, back away, then root it and assist the prime tank again.  If I have mana, I will DoT the parked MOB to soften it up.  If I know the first target will take long enough, I might even hit it with the slower disease DoT as well.<br><br>This is only applicable if you don't have a chanter for crowd control, of course.  And you have to be careful if you're the main healer, since usually if the tanks need a heal they need it NOW, and you can't always do that if the parked mob breaks or resists root.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>  At one time, while playing around with an enchanter "Dueling" we tested the Malaise and Tashan's line of magic debuff spells.  They stacked about a year ago, in PVP at least.  Even if they don't stack any longer, if you are in a group with a wizard or a mage and a enchanter, let the enchanter cast his mag debuff, then cast yours on top of it.  The enchanter line of mag debuff seems to stick better, but after it sticks, the Malaise line of spells will stick readily.  Even if they no longer stack, if there are people in the group casting elemental attack spells, your mag debuff will be better for the group.  Working recently with an enchanter, I was sticking Malaise on red mobs at level 30.  Group of 6.
