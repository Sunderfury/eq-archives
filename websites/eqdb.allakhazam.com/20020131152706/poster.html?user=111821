It was going to be the first masively multiplayer first person shooter, but i there's another game that beat them to it. planetside i think.  BUT what neocron has, that planetside lacks, is a role playing element.  In neocron, you can roleplay more than a dumb grunt. there isn't much of tradeskills, but the set up of the game, as well as the ambience and the graphics all create a very convincing atmosphere.  (hopefully) coming in 2nd quarter 2002! get it when it comes out, you won't be sorry<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>the forest smelled faintly of pine and wildflowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim starlight filtered in through the mighty crown of trees towering above the forest inhabitants.  Here and there, gently glowing pixie trixters flitted about pulling their pranks on unsuspecting Wood Elves.  Admidst all this action, there stood an enchanter who almost seemed serene.  He slowly looked left, then right, and strode away from the towering grace of Kelethin.<br>a short ways from the Wood elf city, he allowed his illusion to drop.  While he had few qualms with his lighter cousins, he knew that they still carry many predjudices, and wouldn't hesitate to eradicate him for the crime of being Of the Enemy.<br>With barely a rustle of his pale green silk drape gliding over the grasses and rocks, as he slipped from shadow to shadow, a darkness within the darkness.<br>The orc lookout never knew what hit him, as the orange sparkles swirled around his head, and then settled on his throat, squeezing the breath out of him.  his eyes bulged as he scratched at his neck, trying to free himself from the choking he was feeling, but in the end he collapsed.  Dartagian emerged from teh shade of a tree behind the orc, and with a swift flick of his obsidian blade, he made sure the orc would not wake up.  &quot;i could have been a rogue&quot; he thought to himself &quot;never be seen, and always catch your enemies off their guard.&quot;  with the help of his magical strength, he dragged the weighty orc's corpse beneath a copse of trees away from the camp, and made a quick check of the orc's pockets. &quot;Rat's tails, snail shells...what's this? a rabbit's foot.&quot; he muttered quietly to himself &quot;a lucky charm for a primitive and inferior race.  why cannot these creatures carry useful things? ah! here we go! 2 silver pieces and a copper piece.  not much but it will buy my meals for a day or two.&quot;<br>Like the rustling of a breeze, Dartagian slipped away into the night, leaving the orc lookout for the night forest's scavangers.<br>He felt and smelt the yawnimg maw of the cave before he saw it.  The heavy sulfurious fumes that continually poured forth from the cave were indication alone of the orcs, but thesight of several firey braziers and orcish centurions  milling around it's mouth were clear indication of the residence of the foul beasts within.  Dartagian sat back on his haunches, drawing his fine Shadowhaven cloak around himself as he pondered his situation.  in the end, after some minutes of examining his spell book, Dart decided to Charm an Orc, and then cause it to start fighting it's fellows.<br>He rose up from the thick underbrush like a hell-spawned wraith and began weaving the elaborate traceings of his charm with his fingers as he muttered the words ever so quietly.  And yet through the magics of the spell the quiet, soothing words reached the orc's ears and made it drowsy, gradualy turning its mind over to that of the Enchanter.  AS Dartagian was about to complete the spell, he percieved something move beside him, and he was distracted by the flashing of a rust-covered hatchet swinging at him.<br>he cursed as the hatchet bounced off of his magical shielding, however the damage was done.  The tiny orc pawn started hollering a warning to its compainion orcs as Dartagian's black blade slashed the orc's throat in two.<br>The Orc centurions were immediately on their guard.  Two cautiously ventured forth from their guard posts to find the cause of the disturbance.<br>A pair of throwing knives flashed through the night and pierced one of the two investigating orcs in his upper thigh.  The knives did no significant damage to the orc, however it encouraged both orcs to holler bloodcurdling war yells, and they charged Dartagian's position, with the rest of their pack closely behind them.  Dartagian smiled, and complete the creation of his Animation.  a tiny image of a dagger grew cracks in his palm, and then crumbled to dust.  He blew the dust into the air in front of him and it coalesced into an invisible Axe wielding warrior before him.  &quot;Defend me now, my pet. defend me against these Orcish Hordes.&quot; he said as the whooping shouts of the 10 strong orc company grew closer.  Mentally checking his magical armour and enhancements, Dartagian took a deep breath, and stepped from behind his tree, arms raised and a new spell upon his dark lips.<br>The orcs skidded to a halt, unsure of how to react to this new development.  Were not the Dark Elves their allies, which their Emperor Crush had so frequently proclaimed?  When the first of their company fell with his charred brains bursting forth from his head, all doubt fled their collective minds.<br>With a cacophony of cries, they lept into battle, and met the Animation of Dartagian.  With a mighty axe which slashed orcs, and a shield which battered them, the orcs had trouble felling their new foe.  One by one, the orcs dropped to fell magics, or to fatal dosages of metal to their heads, until finally an expiring orc, showing an unheard of reserve of strength, cleaved Dartagian's animation into two pieces, which then left this plane of existance.<br>The battered and bloodied orc pulled itself off the ground and leveled a bloodshto glare at Dartagian.  &quot;You, who are my foe, and a traitor to thy people,&quot; the Orc began, &quot;You shall never pass me, and shall never defeat my people within Clan Crushbone.  you shall never return to your home, for your people shall know of your treachery&quot;  With those words, the strongly muscled orc leapt at Dartagian, a wild scream contorting it's already twisted face, and struck Dartagian a blow such that he hadn't felt in many years.<br>Dartagian's first thought was to flee, for he had little reserves from which to draw his magical powers from.  Dartagian was almost overcome with despair when he realised that if he ran, he'd have nowhre to run to.  He was in the middle of the Wood Elves territory, and despite his recent treachery, they would still happily strike him down.  Dartagain danced away from the Orc, and drew his Obsidian Shard, grinning evilly at the orc, as he remembered his advantage over all other  Spell-casters: He had trained himself to be proficient in combat as well as spells.<br>Dartagian and his Orc opponent danced around each other, each scoring hits upon the other, until dartagian felt he had enough energy for one last spell.  Nicking the orc across it's eyes, he then danced away and began the motions for his Chaotic Feedback spell.  The orc, regaining sight, stared at the wildly gesturing Dark Elf, and grabbing up a spear belonging to one of his fallen comrades, he charged the Enchanter.<br>Dartagian sat with his back to a tree, hidden from view by a screen of branches and grasses. The noise of soft footfalls stirred him as he watched a group of Elves walk by, barely noticing the company of fallen orcs.  They merrily trotted into the cave, to begin their share of Orc bashing for the day.  Dartagian shook his head and went back to bandaging his many nicks and cuts.  He'd have to see a healer about that piece of spear stuck in his ribs, but it looked like the bleeding was done with.  Where his drape was pale green and flowing on his left side was now brown and crusty, but he had survived the dieing orc's blow. He had survived the charging monster, and now has told his tale.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>author's random note:<br>I know i'm not the best writer in the world, so i'm depending on you people to give me feedback about my writing.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>When i woke from a pleasant night's sleep, i found myself in the western commonlands. All around me i could hear the competing calls of birds and peoples hawking their wears.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was nearly defeaned by a merchant next to me bellowing his offer to buy anyone's Wurmslayer sword, however a quick application of the Choke spell solved that problem.<br>I looked around me, peering at the various beings surrounding me.  All of them were lower peoples than i(by virtue of not having the good fortune to be born as a Tier'dal; but hey we can't all be lucky) and so were not worth my time to engage in conversation.  Then someone shouted something about the moon, Luclin.  She was very far distant and her shout had little strength left in it, however my sensitive ears picked up her shout, and i was inclined to ask her more about it.  I rose up from my meditation, and proceeded to lithely slip through the underbrush in the direction i had heard the shout from.<br>I must admit i almost stepped on her, but it really wasn't my fault.  She was a gnome, and you know how short those guys are.  I stepped back and began the incantations to make myself resemble one of her kind.  5 minutes of conversing, coercing and bribing later(Innoruk be praised; it's great being an enchanter) i divinned that the erudite wizard Al'kabor had reopened the portals to Luclin, and had discovered the remains of the Combine Empire there.  This in itself was facinating, but the prospects that intrigued me even more were that there was a library there...with ancient and power spells of the Combine Empire.  I may be a mere 4th circle Enchanter, but i know a good thing when i hear it.  My new, overriding goal was to get to the moon Luclin, no matter what the cost.<br>As i dispelled the illusion of a gnome and replaced it with one of a Wood elf, I could not help but to feel a rising bile in my throat.  The Tier'dal, who had hounded my people and driven us underground, into our subterranian lairs...I digress. it's just the thought of these &quot;fair folk&quot; who hold themselves so noble and high and mighty makes me sick.<br>With my new wood elf form i headed into the city of norrath.  I am familiar to the guards and merchants in the city and they accept me as an opponent of the Deathfist Orcs, however my goal this time is no Townsfolk of Freeport, but instead a kindly Druid to take me to the Karanas.<br>My sly eyes, do they spy nought one but several druids of sufficient season to perform the work i needed from them.  Even better, there was one i had seen in my dream-travels in luclin.  Lufa Lynx, Woodelf Druid of many seasons, would take me there...<br>I slipped up behind her, and with a gentle word in her ear(and a quick alliance spell on her thoughts) she agreed to take me to the Karanas.  She rationalized it as &quot;i was already planning on going back to luclin...&quot; but i know that my spells are plenty effective. My, what big horns i have...<br>A quick teleport later and i was on the ground clutching my gut.  I don't know why, but whenever i coerce a druid into teleporting me, i always get sick.  Never happens with wizards though.  Must be the pure goodness of the goody two-shoes treehuggers.<br>I ran through the plains towards the spires, and upon arrival, i discovered that the Scion of the Nexus who remained there to open the portal for travelers didn't care for the Fier'dal.  Not that she killed me outright, but that she simply ignored me.  Well, that's an advantage of being an enchanter.  I cast an illusion of a kindly older Human Mage upon myself, and found that she was more than willing to talk to me and prepare me for my travels.  Such bumblin, unsuspecting humans.  Any Fier'dal would have seen right through my disguise, but this human fell for it, hook, line, and sinker.<br>A mere moment later i was transformed into magical energy and was shot to the moon.<br><br>Diary of Dartagian D'Fierzo, 4th circle Enchanter.<br>Enchanting people, places and things for 12 seasons.<br>~~~~~~~~~<br>Stay Tuned for Dart's adventures on The Moon!<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>We entered the lair silently, seeking to find a stronghold, and keep it.&nbsp;&nbsp;the air was damp, smelled of dung and worse.  Here and there on the walls i saw paw-prints.  It wasn't too unusual, until i saw that the prints were in blood.  my stomach turned inside-out.  Far ahead of us, i could hear the horrid panting-breathing of one of the Gnolls.  it was a handsome specimen, white fur, dark paws, and it was wearing a brilliant red tunic.  Memory revealed it to be a member of the Lteth caste, the gnoll's laughable attempt at Rogues.  quitely, Narly, the dwarven warrior stole up behind it, with grace surpassing his small size, and delt it the first of many blows it would feel. it howled and spun around, striking Narly with many swift strikes, few of them finding the chinks in gnarly's armor.  The skilled barbarian i looked over my shoulder to see our skilled barbarian shaman already weaving a spell.  a second later, the hair on the back of my neck stood up right, as a wave of painfully cold frost swept past me to slam into the Gnoll.  it paused in it's attack to shake away the pain of the coldness.  i saw my chance and rapidly wove a spell of my own.  A moment later, the gnoll was no longer worrying about the iceicles hanging from it, but rather it's hair which was all burnt off.    Narly was looking in a bad way now; the gnoll's dagger had been poisoned.  I cast a healing spell on him, and pored through my spellbook for a spell to heal him of the poison. there it is! i memorised the spell, and cast it on Narly as the gnoll fell, choking on it's own blood.  Narly and hador, looked around, triumphant, bleeding and covered with blood, as i and our shaman worked feverishly to heal them of their wounds.  We had won only the first of our battles within the lair of the splitpaw, but we had won nonetheless.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>So I decided to try my hand at blacksmithing today.<br>100pp later, i have a 44, up from 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;i start to get the feeling that i have bad luck at this, espescially when i failed seven times in a row at making metal bits at 44 skill.<br>ah well. things could be much worse.<br>This very nice gnomish enchanter gave me Insight, which is remarably helpful.  Buddy, if you're reading this, THANK YOU.<br><br>On luclin, with my enchanter, i learned today that: Having Mist and Lesser Shielding a God Does Not You Make.  I was camping Derv 1 with a full group, and we were doing rather well. we had 2 enchanters, a druid, a bard and 2 warriors.  We did rather well...until Dorn showed up.  We were in the middle of a pull, and he decided to come along for the ride.  Death numero Uno.<br>Next time, after the freshly killed group reassembled, they suggested i create a pet to hold him off so the rest of us could flee. Okay, sez I.  So i animate a nice axe wielding animation.  2 minutes later, an orc attacks me.  i take no notice of it because my pet is already whupin it's tail.  the orc runs away, through the dervish camp, and my pet dutifully follows it, determined to avenge my name.  Next thing i know, is LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<br>turns out that on it's way back my pet aggro'd the entire camp, inculding Mr. Dorn himself, who all beat my pet into submission with a chair leg, and then proceeded to play the bongos on my skull.  or so my group says, who all fled when they saw my pet's train.  Oh no, let's not tell the enchanter who is busily meditating so we won't all die when we pull next.....i'm not bitter really.<br>The third time Dorn popped, we had just cleared out the camp and were waiting for respawns.  the level 14 monk says "he's only yellow to me, we can take him" so the rest of us agreed.  the monk pulled him, and we started to whale on th' foo'.  Bad, bad, bad, bad.  i should've taken the oppertunity to run instead of fight.  As luck would have it, Dorn is rather magic resistant, and to the spells of a mere 12th level enchanter, he's invulnerable.  one by one i watched my party either die at Dorn's feet or run and then die.  I tried to run, but not only is he magic resistant, but he's buff.  after a couple sucker punches, i'm out cold.  and then *WHAMMO!* i'm gone LOADING, PLEASE WAIT time.<br>About that time i went to get my corpse, and decided it was time to go to work.<br>Net result of camping Derv 1 for 4 hours: Same level of exp as i started with(1 yellow/2blue) and 7 cutthroat insignia rings.<br><br>Until i remember about this again, Adieu<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
