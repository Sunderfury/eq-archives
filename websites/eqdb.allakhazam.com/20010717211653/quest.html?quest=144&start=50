This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest. The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it out.  When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.  He tells you to go talk to his sister Nolusia who is in the Erudin Palace.  Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.  When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.  Her brother is at Crows  (It seems he is sick and is in need of some Erud's Tonic.  This is a side quest).<br><br>Go to Qeynos and talk to him. Ask him about Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear, and he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dyllin Starshine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport).  Beware that any smugglers around him will come to his aid.  Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard, +Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers)  The faction hits for him are pretty large, so be aware after that of potentially slipping to KOS in Qeynos.<br><br>After going back to Qeynos, go back to Moodoro and say I want page 34.   He says ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I get it because the work is fiction anyway.  He then offers to play a game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a jester he will give you the page.  Along with the jester, you might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight.   [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward].  Once the whole thing is combined you get the Testament of Vanear, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop lore item.  You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum.<br><br>NOTE:  I am told that you can avoid Erudin completely by giving Moodoro Finharn 2gp (the same guy that you get page 34 from) and he gives you the 2-slot book of the testament of Vanear.  Once you get the book, you can combine the page you get from Moodoro (by playing his card game) and the other page from Dylin in HighHold Pass and you've got the book!  No need to go to Erudia.  And because Moodoro sometimes hangs out at one of the sewer entrances, evil races could sneak in and get the book, too. )</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have killed Dyllin about a week ago. I was level 26 at that time. I am writing this to make sure nobody does the mistakes I did and dies like I have.<br>Before going there, I read some of the posts saying only two smugglers will help Dyllin, one of which is about Dyllin's level and the other one is mid 40s. I camped there and after 6 hours he popped. I didn't want to take any chances so I cast harmony on both of the patrolling smugglers. Harmony worked even on the level 45 smuggler. I then attacked him, only to find out 4 smugglers jumped to help him. One of those was red to me so I died pretty quickly.<br>The smugglers were all dubiously to me before I killed Dyllin, so I therefore believe the only way to kill him without dying is having a druid cast Harmony on ALL smugglers near Dyllin, there are about 7. Harmony lasts for long so it's not a problem.<br>After I spawned, that's exactly what I did. Just ran around and cast Harmony, there are three exits to the zone where Dyllin spawns and near each one stand 2-3 smugglers. After that I snared Dyllin and killed him in 4 nukes.<br>I didn't notice any significant changes to my faction with Highpass or Qeynos guards, but if anyone wants to improve his faction with Highpass and Qeynos guards I suggest he does the Goblin Ears quets in Highhold Keep - I was dubiously to highpass guards, turned in 6 ears and became apprehensively.<br>Anyway, after killing Dyllin, here are my advices for killing him without dying or having to run to zone:<br>1. When he pops, cast Harmony on all smugglers in the near area, including the two patrolling ones.<br>2. Cast Snare on him and then just nuke him with the best you got - I killed him with Dizzying Wind for about 120 dd a pop. That spell usually gets resisted a lot but he was green to me so did full damage. I continued nuking him even after he engaged melee with me, he interrupted me only once and missed a lot. After 4-5 nukes he was dead. If you don't Snare him and he's green to you, he will run away quickly and alert any smugglers he can, possibly highpass guards too.<br><br>Follow these two guidelines and you will be safe. I felt proud that my Harmony worked on creatures that are 20 levels higher than me.<br><br>Marblond Beastmasterr<br>29th season Druid of Morell-Thule<br>&nbsp;<br>Marblond Beastmasterr<br>52nd Season Druid of Morell-Thule</td></tr>

RARELY is there ever anyone camping Dylin on Sol Ro. I've seen him pop 4 or 5 times myself in the last week and only one time was anyone there camping him. So last night I decided to go after him. I guess I got lucky because the red guard had just started making his walk down to the water when I attacked Dylin. He resisted my roots so I snared him, threw Swarm on him and Hit him with 4 or five lightning before he fell.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>   I think most people just wont sit there for 6 to 7 hours and thats what it takes. The red guard was red to a 37 that was there and he is definitly on a clockwork schedule. You just have to get there when hes not camped and camp. Kick back have fun bring some friends. All the smugglers were amiable so no problem there. When he spawned he was toast before he took many steps.<br>  We were there for almost the full seven hour spawn time as he had recently been killed when we arrived. As long as the smugglers dont see ya no problem keep him in the alcove and slaughter him when the red walks up the walk acroos the way, not the one right where he spawns. Havnt been near corrupt guards yet but ivre heard that 1 kill was enough to be Kos to them.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Camped Dyllin for 5 hours the other day, alot of other friendly players stopped by to check out the camp - Thanks for the extra buffs and advice.<br>Well, after 5 hours of waiting, I was giddy when he spawned.  Managed to control my excitement and time the guards as they passed (this only added another 3 minutes to my wait) and the cost was clear.  Cast Root, Smite, Smite then Root broke!!!<br>First thing Dyllin does is run for his buddies - the coward!! <br>So I'm fighting Dyllin missing, every other hit, and his buddies are poking me for 1 point of damage - just enough to interupt my casting.  Need a few more point to AC I think.<br>Dyllin is down to about 50% hp and I'm at about 70% and I'm thinkiing I just might make it trying to tank with my cleric.<br>The red smuggler shows up and his me hard a few times so I run for the zone. Barely made it - the drop from the cliff brought me down to just a sliver of health - cast healing and made it to the zone.<br>Med and heal, Gate back to my bind point near Dyllan and he's there just standing by the cave with his blue buddies.<br>I checked to see who was in the Zone and ask a kindly warrior to give me a hand.  He was up for it.<br>Brought him in and warned him about the red smuggler.  Dyllian had moved back to his tent, so we waited until the red one was gone.<br>This time there was no casting at all we just whacked away at Dyllin so the big crybaby would not run until it was too late.<br>My thanks to the Warrior.  I sure do like this book.<br><br>I guess what I really wanted to add here was if you need help, ask someone (expecially someone with no use for page 30) hehheh.<br><br>Illende<br>17 lvl cleric of Tunare<br>Terris Thule<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

At lvl 20 all smugglers were green to me except one that was blue and one red guy.  These both wander, but as you camp there it won't take long to figure out their marching pattern. Druids, wait till the red guy turns the bend toward the water, cast harmony on the other wandering smuggler if he's close and he won't lay a hand on you as you pound Dyllin with every dot, dd and root/snare you have. Took all of twenty seconds to kill him..didn't get hit once.  If this helps, my kill was on Sunday night at about 1230am...as this is a rare 6-8 hour spawn this timing info woulda been helpful for me if I had it.

Do the short version of the quest by collecting the book and 1st page in Queynos.<br>2. I recommend not sitting and camping Dyllin for hours and hours. Play another character and check in on the dyllin camp every hour or so.<br>3. I was a 25 dru and killing him is easy if you are not rushed. wait for him to do his walk. He walks down to where you come out of the water to get to him in this area. Look around, make sure no reds are close. Snare, 4 careless lightnings and minimal melee will do it.<br>4. combine and enjoy .... havent addressed the Queynos faction hit yet.<br><br>no matter what else you read, do this quest. easiest quest for biggest gain there is .... in fact if you are lucky, u could do it in 15-20 min if dyllins out.<br><br>Thats about it ........ good luck!<br><br><br>Grawl Darkdawn<br>25th Dru<br>7th Hammer<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
