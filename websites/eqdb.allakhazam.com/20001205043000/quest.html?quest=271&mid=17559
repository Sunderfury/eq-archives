He is possibly the worst creature to camp in the game. You can expect to be camping him straight for a week. <br><br>My friend and I moved our alternate characters into the cave. We left them there and continued to play our main characters for a few days until the server went down for a patch. Taking advantage of this, we got on the server as soon as we could as it came back up. There are two placeholders for the bear, both are wandering Icebones. As both of our characters could track, we just sat in the cave and tracked to see if any of the 7 icebones within range were moving. Then we maneuvered past the lich and killed them. Then we noted the time. After this we camped our characters and waited six hours. We logged on and "claimed" our rights to the bear. The best place to wait for it is in Sulon's room. It will spawn either in the middle of the room, or right near Sulon. Once the bear spawns, you will have to avoid the lich, and watch out for Sulon, a level 51 paladin searching for the dusty jawbone got slaughtered by him in about 5 seconds after walking too close to him. <br><br>I would not suggest camping this bear with your main character(shaman). The reason for this is simple.  The cave is very dangerous, things can go wrong fairly quick. And you won't be able to depend on SoW or gate if Sulon or the Lich decides to kill you. We could afford the death of our alternate characters if we messed up. <br><br>Some things to note:<br><br>This camp will suck! We started it just after our server came back up after patch. Killed both place holders. For the next 5 days, we logged every 6 hours, "claimed" our spawn, and waited about an hour (the camp is an average 7 hours. We timed it exactly, but it would always be no more than 8 hours after the last kills, and no less than 6 hours). Starting at noon, going for 5 days, here an average time of how our camp went: <br><br><br>12 (right after patch) 2 icebones<br>7pm 2 wandering icebones<br>2am 2 wandering icebones<br><br>9am  2 wandering icebones<br>4pm   "<br>11pm "<br><br>6am "<br>1pm "<br>8pm "<br><br>3am "<br>10am "<br>5pm "<br><br>12am "<br>7am BEAR SPAWNED the other spawn was a placeholder<br>9am Server went down for scheduled maintenance<br><br>If you add up the hours, that's over 14 hours of waiting on the placeholders.<br>The thing that makes the camp so terrible is that if you do it like we did, you will suffer from accute fatigue only getting about 5 hours sleep in between each spawn. We used multiple family members to help camp this. Another nasty thing is that sometimes the bear doesn't drop the pelt. If this happened to us, I'd think I'd cry. I have heard some say that the bear isn't that rare, but we observed about 26 placeholders. Other websites say the bear spawns one in 4. But not ours.<br><br>YOUR BIGGEST FEAR if you attempt to do this as we have, will be the danger of server going down, resetting the spawn, a zone repop, missing a spawn and losing the timing of it, or losing the spawn to someone who arrived earlier than you.<br><br>Did I mention Kill Stealers?<br><br>We had several people threaten to take the camp out from under us. Luckily  they didn't know the timing so we always had the advantage. When we did finally get the bear, another higher level shaman was standing right next to us. We were worried he might get greedy and KS it, but he did not. Nor did he heal us =) in hopes that we would die. But, we got the pelt and had the helmet after a short 5 hour camp in Cazic Thule temple for the chamoise. I hope this info helps any that are attempting to get it. Make a temporary character in the cave to check the spawn every couple of days. It seems we saw the most competition at odd early morning hours (I guess they expected it wouldn't be camped then) and at one point there was actually a line to wait to camp him. I think this is one of those camps where you just get lucky and see it. Don't do it like we did =) Best way to get this helm is to trade for it =)<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=1 >&nbsp;</td><td  align=right valign=bottom><span style='font-weight: normal; font-size: 9px;'>[<a href=#top>Top</a>]</span></tr></form></table>
