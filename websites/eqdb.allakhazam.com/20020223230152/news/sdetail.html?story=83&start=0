Verant claims they did it by using an exploit.  I'll leave it up to you to debate whether or not that is what happened.<br><PAUSE><br>Here's the explanation they posted on their website:<br><br>We were fighting the 4th warder (ventani) and had it down to 60% or so when kerafyrm spawned, and wiped us out. Kerafyrm then killed the 4th warder.<br><br>Roughly 15 minutes laster, GM Valdelmar comes in and has this to say.<br><br>[Tue Jun 05 00:37:10 2001] Valdelmar shouts, 'Everyone that is in this zone, has a corpse in this zone, or was involved in the invasion of this zone is receiving a warning for Exploitation.'<br><br>Now this is where it gets good. When asked what exactly we exploited, here was the answer:<br><br>[Tue Jun 05 00:44:50 2001] Valdelmar tells you, 'We witnessed your clerics below the bridge keeping the warders agro by complete heal so that the tanks could safely kill. That's exploitation'<br><br>Now, anyone who plays the high EQ game or has a reasonable knowledge of EQ game dynamics knows that this completly IMPOSSIBLE to exploit.<br><br>The mobs summon ability negates this exploit 100%. If the clerics are top on aggro list, they get summoned up from below the bridge, and killed nearly instantly. The mob was on ME (the warrior) the entire battle, besides when it decided it was mad at my clerics - which is when it killed them in no time flat.<br><br>The full story, with screenshots, is at <a href=http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/>this link</a>.</blockquote></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hmmm exploits ?? For those of you who played RP<br>games for quite awhile you remember such silliness<br>as rules that wprked out so that going by them a<br>PC could carry more than a horse and go farther<br>or just where did u carry that 10 foot pole you<br>are using to check the ceiling?? How are you<br>fighting and carrying a heavy crossbow and a 50"<br>coil of rope and using a  2 hand sword at the same<br>time?? anyways verant appears to be full of people<br>in dire need of some counseling. The game was always about having fun that was the point if things looked bad for the party a good GM worked it out somehow and the party lived to fight another day if the GM was a @#%^wipe and killed you all time and again yo told them to piss off and  left them sitting at an empty table looking<br>at their books and dice) So VI smarten the @#%^ up<br>you bunch of self absorbed control freaks we are paying customers or you will find yourselves sitting with a beautiful adventure world that no one wants to play in. No i never used an NPC to go<br>take a look in the cave around the corner or open<br>a closed container  try a potion on touch the shiny red button P if you beleive that I got a bunch of stuff i wanna sell you in EC ) Cheers at<br>conquest exploit or not I was not there cant say<br>When mobs take fall and drowning damage then we can talk about player abuses of @#%^ty programming<br>IMNHO If you killed something its dead you win<br>and in all my time on this earth i have never seen<br>anything outside of a sporting event that resembled a "fair fight" the object is to leave the enemy dead or incapicitated not follow some @#%^ing silly rules&gt; anyways its late am tired and kindly forgive the punctuation and spelling errors  hookd on fonix owes me a refund<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

And when you do, I hope your endevours are as successful as Verant's.  350,000 ppl (est) are currently subscribed.  Did Verant ever plan for such success?  Doubt it!

You might want to come to DAOC, I have a lvl 60 necro on eq, heh, willing to give that up to play with a game that has some sincere and caring people developing it.  It shows here that Verant is a control fanatic.  Common sense tells you that if the clerics are healing and the warriors are doing the damage, then they have the highest aggro.  However, it also shows that the ones that were doing this actually had a strategy in making this happen.  I salute the people that came up with a strategy to overcome this.  As for Verant, you will lose more and more people every day.  Just keep this bs up and I can see you losing even faster.  I personally will enjoy your downfall.  I might even "..ss on your grave.

(it's not the same as fleeing the water to escape death, it's more like fishing with dynamite...very unsportsmanlike).  <br><br>on conquest's behalf, the GM could easily have stepped in and warned them that they were breaking the rules instead of watching silently and accumulating evidence in order to ban players.<br><br>but a query to all the conspiracy theorists who beleive that "verant doesn't want it's game beaten": please explain the motive.  <br><br>would any of us have stopped playing (and paying) when we heard the sleeper had been beaten?  doubtful. everyone in the game cheers when an unconquered mob gets conquered (though i suppose there is some jealousy between the super-guilds).  why would they risk all the negative feedback they knew they would have to endure?  so a couple of programmers can boast about the "unbeatable Everquest"?  not likely.  <br><br>why would they spend money to pay programmers to put features into a game and then not want anyone to see them?  <br><br>we all love to hate the faceless corporate giant, but in this case, what is the motive for this "evil"?<br><br>imho,<br>nimbledigits<br><br>ps everyone who is of the "well, verant allowed the bug to be in the game, so it's their own fault" are missing the point entirely.  the rules state that exploiting a bug can result in banning.  end of story.<br>  <br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>To make money in this world, you need a gimmick. Also, you need to exploit the people who are customers, and/or the people that work for you.<br><br>As fun as EQ is, it's a business. By making it take forever to go up in levels or requiring lots of people to do anything, Verant protects its cash flow. Introducing new zones, mobs, items, and quests are all ways to keep players into the game.<br><br>Anyone ever see the bumper sticker that reads, "Don't steal, the government hates competition" ? This situation reminds me of that sticker. Verant doesn't want any player exploitation of the game because it undermines their own exploitation.<br><br>As a player, I could care less what uber guilds do or what they do first. That does nothing to hamper the "roleplaying" aspect of my game. NPCs that give the same responses over and over again and mobs that "exploit" their ability to hit me from the ceiling and floor without my being able to hit back do more to lessen my enjoyment of the "roleplaying" aspect of the game. The same with broken spawns. Yet there is no one to ban when the game works badly or when there are server issues that lead to frequent disconnects for many customers.<br><br>The members of Conquest are paying customers. They should be thanked for finding the bug and offered jobs as testers. Verant has no one to blame but themselves for this fiasco. If the zone was so drastically bugged in a way that such major mobs could be killed with relative ease, then the zone should not have been released. If the main reason Conquest was doing this was for their own ego, then it's Verant's own doing as well. They made the game geared towards rewarding uber guilds. And most uber guilds are bound to get uber greedy and uber arrogant. (Aren't most large corporations this way? *cough* Sony *cough*)<br><br>Since this is a place for opinions, there's mine. As long as I continue to enjoy the game, and am a sucker for this gimmick, I'll keep playing and paying. <br> <br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Verant gets scared when conquest is threatening to kill the 4th warder and spawn the sleeper because the zone is not yet finished and their program is buggy, so they spawn kerafym(human model, so obviously their program IS buggy) right there to wipe out conquest and the warder....obviously not an appropriate way to handle the situation on verant's part<br>2.When the 4th warder gets down to 60%, it spawns kerafym, and verant had him beefed up to be unkillable while they are attempting to fix the coding in sleeper's tome...when people start taking screenshots of the "sleeper" being a human model, which is obviously messed up and proves the zone is not completely finished, they come in and make claims about conquest using exploits to kill the warder and start banning them so that as few people as possible will learn of the warder(this didn't work apparently, because the contraversy has made many people go to conquest's boards and see the screenshots)<br>3.Conquest actually did 'sploit(which is very unlikely, seeing as how it is IMPOSSIBLE to nullify a mob's ability to summon, and it is not likely that you could find a certain spot where you could stand there and a mob could not hit you.)<br>well, thats just what i put together from the facts i have heard about this incident. if anyone from conquest is reading this, i feel really sorry for ya and you guys must rock if you have the force to get the 4th warder down to even 60% i hope you guys are able to prove that verant was lying and that you will have success in the future. =)<br>p.s. verant blows goats<br><br> <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Yes folks, this is the official statement from VI. <br><br>It is also an embarrasment to the company in which it is attributed to. Never have I seen a VI calaber company act in such an unprofessional way as to take our guildchat COMPLETLY out of context, and at the same time have it filled with OUTRIGHT UNDENIABLE LIES.<br><br>Lets take a look, shall we...<br><br>basically the 28 Conquest players were (among other things) purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate list, the "z" coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that it took to kill the monster. <br><br>This is just an outright lie, period. EASILY proveable with the testimony of hundreds of everquest players who have killed the warders, and many other everquest mobs. YOU CANNOT EVER nullify the npcs summon ability - it is simply impossible. Hell, even VI employee's who play the high level game can vouch for that.<br><br>And to top it all off, we never even came CLOSE to killing the monster. The mob was down to 65% at most when we lost (yes we LOST the fight badly - VI decided it was wise to spawn kerafyrm anyways to kill the last few of us off - thus triggering their entire script)<br><br>In addition, SOE staff observed various members of the guild discussing the cheating -- these comments include:<br><br>...<br><br><br>These lines are totally taken out of context. They were NEVER in reference to the exploit you are describing (which isnt even possible to execute - you can even ask various co-workers like narris, kendrick, etc - you know, the guys who have a CLUE how the game works). These guildchat lines are in reference to useing rez effects to prevent the slow spell from stacking. The SAME tactic EVERY guild who killed yelinak used (casting clarity to overwrite yelinaks AE), the SAME tactic every guild who fought aaryanar used (lots of spells overwrote his AE), and the SAME tactic every guild who killed the 3rd warder used (useing snare so its AE wouldnt take hold). The statements were made IN JEST, because useing this border-line exploit is about as illegal as jaywalking. Verant watches people use these tactics EVERY DAY and doesnt even care - not to mention this isnt what we have been charged with doing.<br><br>Give me 8 hours of guildchat of ANY high end guild, and ill cut and paste you a reason to disband them.<br><br>As far as the guild being disbanded, the rules state:<br><br>Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct . . . may be disbanded.<br><br>How is ONE INCIDENT habitually violating the rules of conduct?<br><br>The last paragraph is particularly embarrasing to your company...<br><br>(i) Conquest did not complete the encounter &#8211; SOE staff inadvertently spawned the Sleeper during its efforts to stop the cheating <br><br>SOE staff spawned the sleeper due to their superiority complex... They could have very easily killed the CQ members with death touch. Spawning a lvl 99 mob that quads 1950 and death touches, that is KOS to anything and everything (even the npcs in teh zone) AND that sets off serverwide scripts is SURELY not the handbook procedure for killing off a dozen people who are allready LOSING BADLY to the mob you claim they are exploiting.<br><br>ii) the &#8220;human figures&#8221; in some screenshots are a result of the screenshot taker not patching<br><br>How can you feel comfortable spreading such blatent lies? Perhaps you should view this screenshot which shows both the human kerafyrm model AND the sleeper model in the same shot. <br><br><a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/sleepers/sleeper01.jpg" target=_new>http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/sleepers/sleeper01.jpg</a><br><br>DOH, didnt think we had one of those i bet.<br><br>(iii) the zone is complete and working -- once SOE has patched fixes to these exploits we encourage players to wake the Sleeper.<br><br>Not really. The script is worse shape then ever before. <br><br>Patched fixes to the exploits eh? All you've patched is upgrading the 3rd warders AE to make it COMPLETLY impossible, so noone will EVER complete your unfinished zone.<br><br>New 3rd warder AE (get this)<br><br>7500 dot over 1.5 mins<br>15 second stun<br>12 second reset<br>Whirl till you hurl (makes the player spin)<br><br>Needless to say, 3rd warder will never die in this form.<br><br>BTW you screwed up veeshans peak by changing the 3rd warder's ae - Nexona shares that spell. May want to patch that.<br><br>    -Tiak<br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

Cleric with FA resses them, but they do not click on the box.  Tanks fight, get AE damage, click box when a heal is needed.  Cleric re-resses, rinse and repeat.<br>7.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I must say that although I do not know all the facts of this event, it does sounds as if they were using a tactic that they KNEW would limit the mobs ability to fight back.  It just sounds unfair to use a known bug to prevent a mob from hitting you JUST so you can claim that your guild was the first PROVEN group to complete the kill.  <br><br>I feel that this is NOT just a hack and slash type game...it is a ROLE PLAYING GAME.  And as such, this type of behavior takes a GREAT DEAL away from the realism of the game for everyone else.  Sure, I have to admit, that I would LOVE to claim that I was the one that killed this mob, but I would NEVER want to do it using a strategy that includes using a known bug in my favor.  Verant should have fixed this problem yes, but it was not and therefore....should not have been used to benefit the guild.  <br><br>Besides...how many people even try this?  Wouldnt Verant's time and resources be put to better use by developing new realeases and dealing with bugs that effect a larger portion of the player base?  I am sorry but since I know I wont be going to this zone any time soon...I feel that it's more important to asure the majorities ability to play the game the way it should be played..using fair and honest role playing.<br><br>This is just an opinion that I have.  One that I am sure is not viewed as the popular one but still...it is my opinion.<br><br>Perhaps instead of a complete banning...Verant should ban them from the zone and knock all of them down a specified amount of levels( say 10-15) and put them on probation.  Just a thought...<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

A few other posters have said they read all the info, or have been following the story, ... blah blah blah!<br><br>Here's a question for you, if you've read all the info, what do SOE's logs say about what happened?  How long were the GM's there watching without being seen?  Are you a member of either SOE or Conquest?<br><br>You HAVEN'T seen all the info.  You HAVE seen Conquests very one sided (and I understand why) version of the events as they occurred.  You may have read the short statement SOE put out to address the issue.  But you have not read/seen ALL the info.<br><br>It's bad business to publicly talk about things of this nature.  SOE gave their statement, and that's it.  But being in business they'd have to be colassal idiots to do something like this without cause.  And the reasons proposed are not good causes.  You really think SONY, you know the company that has more money than God, is going to take bad PR unless they have legitimate and just cause?  People, this is a business and you don't make arbitrary decisions in business.  Especially if you want to be sucessful.  And I think SOE want's to be successful.<br><br>That being said, if Conquest was knowingly exploiting bugs in the system, do you think they're going to admit it?  I think they were, and you can read my other post to find out why, but they'd be stupid to admit it.  They want SOE to look the villian, that's a standard defense tactic.<br><br>Unless SOE were to release their logs of the incident, which they won't and nor should they, we'll never know the whole story.  But being as Sony wouldn't take the PR hit without reason, I'm inclined to side with them.<br><br>PS NO I don't work for SOE.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
