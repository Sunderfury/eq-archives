	   <tr><td colspan=2>alright, i was down right assaulted for comments i made concerning clerics that melee in groups.  basically, i said, clerics shouldn't melee.  yep, they shouldn't.  now i am talking basically 30+. personally, i stopped carrying a weapon around level 15.  <br><br>my reasoning is this, if you are hitting a monster, you are not medding.  good clerics med as much as possible, they sit there telling bad catholic priest jokes=)--i am catholic, so it is ok, heh...--and med.<br><br>stunning, and the occasional nuke, i didn't have a problem with, i have a problem with clerics that try to chain stun mobs with high MR--since they are being constantly resisted and are wasting mana that can be used for heals.  someone, reacting to the idea that clerics only buff and heal, jumped to conclusions and listed all the things clerics do well.  i agree, clerics do a lot more than heal and buff.  <br><br>clerics serve many key roles in groups besides buffing, and healing.  root-parking extras, stunning casters, finishing off runners in dungeons with nukes, atoning mobs that won't leave chanters or other casters alone no matter how many times they are taunted, calling a run to zone, or evac(early, so everyone makes it, there will always be more mobs to kill, you don't have to kill the 5 someone just pulled, you can always get more)<br><br>BUT, and it is a big BUT, one of these jobs that clerics serve, is NOT melee.  i understand it may be difficult to come to terms with, but clerics melee like chanters tank, poorly.  we are not a melee class, we are casters.  we cast spells.  we do not melee.<br><br>i have been using complete heal nearly exclusively since level 44, i have greater and superior heal memmed.  greater heal is for chanters, superior heal is for rangers and monks that can't control agro--and the occasional fast heal on a warrior that is being beat down fast.  but still, using the most mana efficient spell in my arsenal(complete heal)i still have trouble keeping up--mana wise--with fast and steady pulls in the dreadlands and LGuk.  <br><br>the idea that a cleric could stand up and melee mobs says one thing to me, your groups aren't pulling fast enough.  i don't want to hear how your groups chain pull and you are always at full mana either, because it isn't true, so just save the time it will take you to type the lie.<br><br>as for fear kiting mobs.  WOOT! clerics love fear kiting.  clerics usually stay near full mana when a group fear kites.  but hitting a mob in this scenario isn't as effective as chain stunning the mob that is being fear kited--depending on level of mob, heh, a level 42 trying to chain stun a fear kited wurm in the BW is silly, i tried it. one out of six stuck--live and learn.<br><br>to sum this up, good clerics med as much as possible.  bad clerics don't.  that is why i ask for items people loot, instead of getting up and looting myself.  i give up my coin loots, for gems and such, so i can sit and med.  try it, people, love it.<br><br>if you are hunting mobs ten levels below the group, and like you want to melee mobs because it is fun, feel free, as long as the group thinks it is ok.  but don't confuse hunting near green mobs with high blue, white/black, yellow, and red mobs.  mobs that con even around 45 and up, will rip your tanks apart to begin with, if you are up meleeing the mobs, you are risking the lives of the people in your group, because you might not have the mana to cast that last superior heal on a tank that needs it to finish off a mob.<br><br>if you need to pound the stuffing out of mobs, to feel like a big tuff god.  heh, do what i do.  go back to your old hunting grounds and pound the snot out of your old enemies.  for me it is orcs in CB.  i usually head there once a week to work out my frustrations of being a weak high elf.<br><br>Clerics are the best healers in the game.  our hitpoint and AC buffs are very nice.  our stuns and root parking abilities add another dimension to us.  the ability to wipe a hate list is invaluable.  but we melee very poorly.<br><br>heh, and to the guy that said he hoped he never grouped with me, sorry, it is your loss.  people in my groups don't die.  and the reason for that is, i don't forget i am a healer.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hmmm, well I checked and it wasn't me who said he'd never group with you.  (I was worried there for a minute too :))<br><br>My question (politely), What is your defense and AC right now?  Without having your Defense skills maxed your AC is possible 200 or more less than it should be.  When a Shardworm Brood Mother turns on you (and she was just hitting me for almost 200 a shot) and your AC/Defense is low how are you going to survive till the tank can taunt her off.  If there is a trick to this then I'm very interested.  The only time I ever die with a cleric present is when the cleric agro's something and gets killed before I can taunt it off.  Higher AC, maxed defense/dodge all are important for that event (and it will happen) when the MoB turns on you.<br><br>I also question the logic of always using C Heal for tanks.  Again the 45 Cleric who keeps me alive almost never casts C Heal, Selestial Heal is his main heal.  I know not everyone has this spell, but once you get it, this is a much lower agro spell and seems to be more mana efficient.  Oh yeh, and being as I am an SK, I do "chain pull" MoB's (even whites) with out Cleric staying at 80-100% mana all the time.  In fact if we have to stop its becasue I need more mana to pull with.  And what I know of Clerics is from watching this guy keep us alive.  He melees at lvl 45, and asks to let the low blue stuff agro him to keep his Defense skills maxed.  Maybe you are an awesome cleric (don't know you're anon here) but the guy I group with is also a great cleric.  He can do damage and heal.  there is more to the Cleric than medding.<br><br>Neptunis<br>lvl 45 DE SK<br>Vesheen Server <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>first of all, my AC is around 747, if i remember right.  defense is a bit low, 155.  i have been working on it lately, going to OT and pulling the weakest blues i can find.  but that is something i do during my time, not group time.  i see it as as something i need to fix, not my group.  within a couple weeks it will be where it should be, 200.  which, if i am not mistaken, is where it maxes out for clerics.<br><br>i haven't died in 5 levels now playing the way i do.  if someone in the group dies, it is because of a bad pull or pathing issues caused by a pull.  oh yeah, lost a ranger because he decided to stay and fight when everyone else called zone on a pull of five mobs, and a warrior because he said no to my evac order, and i was 00M like i said in the evac call.  but everyone has those stories.<br><br>don't have Celestial Healing yet, can't get my hands on it.  hopefully that will change.  but currently, complete heal is the most mana efficient heal spell i have, and every level it gets more so, as the tanks hitpoints increase, it becomes more effective and mana-wise.  <br><br>mobs agro me extremely rarely, cause i am careful.  if you play carefully, mobs should very rarely touch you as a cleric(wow, i know i am going to get nailed for this one by someone, but with the lessened hate for heals, agro is a lot rarer now, honestly, it feels wrong somehow in comparison) but, when the big nasty ones do, i use divine aura and divine barrier to keep myself alive until mob is mezzed, taunted, or root parked.  i use root to keep lower level mobs off me and the rest of the group if we are chanter-impaired ;)<br><br>as for the idea that you chain pull and your cleric isn't between 80-100 mana, that was my point.  clerics need to med as much as possible so you can continue chain pulling like that.  the point i was making about that was, if a cleric isn't at full mana, he has no business standing up and hitting a mob, he/she should sit down and med.<br><br>i am happy for your cleric friend that has someone to play with like you.  but the truth is, if you are grouped--with people not your friends--and your cleric friend has been in melee, and someone needs that last heal, and your friend doesn't have the mana, it is his fault that player died.  and the person who died is going to let him know about it.<br><br>what i was trying to do with my posts was, warn new clerics not to think they can melee whenever they want.  because they can't.  i talked about a list in my other post, those lists are real.  everyone has had someone say, "no, don't get him, he is a jerk"--KS, melee druid, idiot, perma-AFK, got us killed with a bad pull, doesn't med enough, whiner, well, you get the idea here.<br><br>i just want new clerics to be warned that if you aren't medding full time, and someone needs a heal that you don't have the mana for, it is kinda your fault.<br><br>let me also add this, i am not trying to steal your fun.  i am not trying to take the game out of EQ.  i am just saying, if you want to play a cleric, accept the role you have chosen.  not everyone is going to be as forgiving, or nice, as this SK is. <br><br>i apologize for any spelling issues, or grammar problems, it is late for me, and i haven't slept;)...wonder why <br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>That is so rediculous! You have to be the funniest person I have ever met. All you do is, "I'm so down with the cleric playmode" attitude. The point is, you don't get to decide. Give it up, get a real life, EQ is a game. Not life, who gives a crap! Stop your thinking you know how to play a class and just f***ing play! Your style can be totally different than another persons and it doesn't matter! And about that little "we pull a lot" and you said a cleric can almost never be full mana when they are chain pulling, your wrong, I have been in a group on Tarew Mar where the puller has 3 computers at his disposal, we had an enchanter (who pulled with my SoW and mezzed creatures for us to kill), besides us there was a cleric (my cousin, he's cool), and three warriors, the leader of the group was a warrior who had his cleric healing us while he was fighting things with his other two tanks. That cleric was NOT in the group, he was a lvl 56 cleric that was healing us, we were in the mid-level 30s at the time in OT. The cleric IN the group was always full mana and was meeleeing. So I um guess that your wrong, It is possible to be full mana and still be a cleric. Oh and by the way, that door or window or whatever next to you, open it, and look at the real world. Go into it, and enjoy, Everquest is not life.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hide and sneak are fine, so long as people understand that no class other than rogue can combine hide/sneak at same time.  Many don't seem to understand that and it could confuse people that don't.<br><br>Also, low charisma has no effect on fear.  And neither does high charisma either.  Necros with horrible cha and enchanters with 200ish cha using the same fear spell and both same level, will both fear the same.  Sure, you could get a string of resists or short fears as either of them.  But that's chance.  Fear kiting with either is great, really only determining factor is level deifference, MR of mob, and what fear spell is being used (higher ones generally work better, or least they SHOULD, hehe).  So the cha of cleric means nothing for fearing...  What it will mean is he'll need a lot more cha boosting items or have someone cha buff him with a spell so he can buy his all important gems for hp buffs.<br><br>BTW, I have a DE cleric, and his cha sucks at 60 (i think).  Gotta get him buncha plus charisma items so he doesn't go into the poor house buying gems and spells in later levels.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gestalt<br>52 Monk<br>CT</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>DUH Necros can beat clerics!  Clerics in my opinion are the weakest solo class in Everquest and that definitely includes duels.  Heals are no good when you are getting pounded on, and a duel against a necro would have 2 things beating on you.  I don't even think a cleric could beat a necro pet summoned by a same level necro.  If you want to solo your whole damn life, be a necro, that's your business.  But clerics are for large groups and healing and buffing.  Go find a warrior that wouldn't support a cleric, because they know without em even they can't tank long in the mid to upper levels.  Clerics can be the most difficult class to be for many reasons, and if you hate to group I wouldn't be one.  I just hope that before you reach 54 every cleric you ask for a res declines, just because you think you are so much better because you can beat anything one on one.  But try to group without a cleric and see how slow everyone else needs to go because they need their health back.  I just feel sorry for the poor groups who ignore clerics looking for groups when they aren't full, because the number of mobs a group takes on when adding a cleric increases drastically.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

At level 40 I'm sitting at a 197 wis and a 121 str without terribly high end equipment. As for a 1hb you might try a Wraithbone warhammer. They're selling for about 300-600 plat on Xegony and are +5 str and +2 wis. Might not sound like much but if memory serves they're an 8/26 so you'll be outdamaging tanks until level 7 or so. If you've got more money to spend go for two bloodstone rings asap. The extra str and mana will make you a healing machine early on. I would suggest not buying silver jasper rings at all. The extra 2 wis won't add to your mana as much as the extra 30 mana gained from those rings until level 30. Then just go straight to plat/jasper or velium/jasper rings. <br>If you'll post price ranges I can give you a list of equipment suitable for clerics in a hearbeat.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Your best bet for earrings are gold/jasper. They're cheap and since most enchanters are working jewelry skills up like mad if you find a jeweler starting out he might make them for cost. The +3 wis in each ear will outweigh 10 mana. <br><br>If you're hunting Great Divide you might hit the next zone over and fight Ulthorks in Eastern Wastes for a while. They drop some 8ac +3wis -3dex sleeves that are nice for clerics. The plat arms are another bet, a bit more expensive (ulthorks free if you loot it) and they have no AC but they're +3 str and you don't take a hit on Dex.<br><br>Wrist slots are a bit tougher, I used a bracer of Erolisi(sp?) on one wrist and a banded bracer on the other. Remember, I wasn't a twink :) The bracer of Erolisi is +5 str and that's actually a fairly important stat for clerics I've found. If you wish you can buy two Chipped bone bracers or two polished bone bracers. Either are nice for nearly any level. I went with a RMB and a CBB when I could afford new equipment. You can camp either of these drops btw, no use in buying if you don't have to. <br><br>The mammoth hide cloak is almost a must. I stayed in Perma for 16 long and very boring hours at level 35 camping it. The alchemist seems to be a buggy spawn as well. It's supposedly a 20 min spawn timer. In the times I was there I got a PH about 12 times and the Alchemist twice. That's in 16 hours and none of the spawns were regularly timed. Either it skips or isn't really *fixed*, and since I've not heard of a spawn that didn't have a time I supposed it skips.<br><br>If you're high enough level to hunt at the giant fort and are a casting class I'd highly suggest it. Just offer to buy the weapons dropped by the giants as your group is disbanding for the day and before you log off ooc to the zone you're running an ATM service. I've gotten a TP to BB and limped to Kaladim with a 192/110 weight factor before. I made 400 plat that night and about 100 of it was off drops I had won. Then just gate back :) This is even better if you're a druid or wizard.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You are correct in assuming that the armors are nigh-impossible to acquire. You'll need at LEAST, and I mean very least, one group of 55+ to consistently pull and drop the mobs that hold the corroded for Thurgardin armor, and from all the guides I've read it's considered the easiest armor to complete. I've seen these mobs fought by a full group of 50's and I've watched the full group of 50's run like little children as fast as they could with the mobs on their tails. <br><br>I don't know what server you're from but I know on several there are guild alliances such as the XA where high level members of several small guilds band together to take out MOB's that couldn't be dropped by any guild individually. This seems to be a highly effective tactic and allows the guilds to keep their higher level members without fear of losing them to the larger guilds.<br><br>As for armor upgrades, there are some fine armors out there. Many are better than the gold/bronze you're wearing. Bronze has good ac but is a bit on the heavy side. The clerical quest armor is crap IMHO. It's got nice ac but the stat modifiers are a bit dissapointing.<br><br>Chakfor, The Dwarven Cleric of Brell<br>Reminding you that size really doesn't matter<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Dwarves make great clerics, and they are so much fun.  I love the way they do the roll when they jump while they are running.  Makes for a grand entrance when running up to a group. :-)<br><br>I am now a level 42 Dwarf cleric and I made 40 in about 13-15 days played.  If you want to level fast, then this is what I found to work.<br><br>I have mixed feelings about power leveling, but a friend helped me out through about level  6 - 8 or so.  If you have a friend that can help through that much, then great.  If not, then simply do the standard things through that level.  I think that the orc camps in EC and the Derv camps in Nro are the best places to level through about 10 or 12.  After that, as much as I hated it, I moved over to Oasis until about 17.  I then headed out to Lake of Ill omen.  Incredible exp and modest loot.<br><br>Once I hit 25, I moved to the spires outside Split paw.  This is good until about 30 or so then you are ready for the Overthere.  The Overthere is the most amazing exp area in the game.  I usually got a level a day there, and even did 35 in one sitting on a Saturday.  Took about 4 1/2 to 5 hours, but it really was not that bad a hell level there.<br><br>You can do through about 40ish in the Overthere, then it is time to move to the north wall of Karnors Castle in Dreadlands.<br><br>About this time I got tired of the exp grind and have been just adventuring around.  I finally went back and did some of the Sol Ro quests for the armor.  The bracer, legs, and boots are the only real pieces of this armor that are worth anything.  Although if you want to have a complete set of it, go for it.  I already had better +wis stuff, so I only got the bracer, legs, and boots.  I then got Gatorscale legs, so I don't even use the legs anymore.<br><br>You also may try Great Divide in Velious.  I have heard the Kodiak caves are some pretty good exp from the low to mid 30s up to 40ish.  Once you get about 40, you can also camp the Guardian and Ancient wurms outside Thurgadin for your 44th level spell, Celestial Healing.  I have camped this two or three times and still don't have the spell yet.  The exp is pretty good, and you can get some of the other classes spells to sell as well.<br><br>One last thing, never neglect your combat skills.  When you level fast, sometimes your combat skills will not keep up.  My dodge, defense, and 1hb really suffered by leveling so fast.  Take some time to beat on some creatures occasionaly, and have them beat on you.  Have a fellow cleric or a shaman/druid heal you while you fight some creatures that are high green to low blue to you.  This will help keep your defense skills up, and believe me, that is important given the new heal aggro.  You _will_ be getting beat on, and the higher your defensive skills, the better chance of surviving those encounters long enough for the tank or enchanter to pull them off of you.<br><br>I will say it again, never neglect your defense/dodge skills.  They add to your AC and are most important at higher levels.<br><br>Hope this all helps, and good luck on your venture.  Playing a cleric is indeed a group thing after about 20.  Although there are things you can solo for exp at almost every level, the cleric really shines when in a group.<br><br>Boradaf Starforge<br>42 Cleric - The Rathe<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>As a dwarf pull all your points into wis and then put the spare 5 into str. Your strength is already high but it never hurts to have a bit more. You'll find the extra wisdom bonus allows you to sacrifice on +wisdom equipment and wear things with a higher AC which helps with the aggro. <br><br>As soon as you get dodge start taking hits. Do it on purpose. You want dodge maxxed out asap. <br><br>Always keep divine aura memmed, it's even more important than dodge. If I'm fairly close to a zone and the tanks are taking a beating, wizzies are oom, I'm oom, and we have to make a break for it. Just pop DA and tell the tanks to leave the mob on ya. Then bolt. You'll likely save a tank and have a friend for life.<br><br>Remember that if you're Full Mana there's no use for you to keep medding. I've been in groups with two clerics where one will be full and still sitting. You might not do much damage but it all adds up, at least you're taking care of the mobs natural regen :) And it's a wonderful time to work on those combat skills.<br><br>The xp in Lake of Ill omen plays out at level 30 so you got some very good advice there. I didn't hit Paw though. I went to the next zone, Frontier Mountains. My cleric is first character so I needed cash, I made enough there to completely cover a new set of armor and have some left over for a vacation to Velious. Overthere is a nice place as well but I happen to think that the cougars in Iceclad are MUCH better xp than OT..And once you hit 34 the Ulthorks in Eastern Wastes make OT look like a nerfed zone.<br><br>The most important thing to playing a cleric is this though....HAVE FUN!!!! You'll never lack for a group, you'll make a LOT of friends, you'll help a lot of people. But if you're not having fun it's really not worth it.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

From either of these its possible to hunt in Everfrost, Black Burrow, Qeynos Hills, West Karana, and the Qeynos Aqeducts. In Qeynos hills you can hunt Rabid Grizzlies and do the quest related to their pelts (gets you in good with the local clerics guild as well) for 1 to 3 pp and a cleric spell. Everfrost & the Karanas both have bears and cats for high-quality pelts, with Everfrost adding mammoth calf groups & the Karana's bandit groups - both are always in need of skill healers but true clerics are rare. Black Burrow can be much harder with all the trains but it is possible to make a good bit of money by selling gnoll skins to monks (helps to have 2 non-ruined gnoll pelts with them), and a decent cleric weapon (runed totem staff) drops in there.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Everyone here has had some excellent points made concerning how a cleric should be played, but I would just like to clarify some things. Basically, a cleric can be played in a variety of ways, and whether or not a certain method is more productive than another depends on the intentions of the user. If you're a selfish cleric, people will die. If you're a unobservant cleric, people will die. If you're an uneducated cleric, you and other people will die. BUT, if you're having fun, I guess how you play your cleric isn't important (just don't expect to make many friends). There is certainly a difference between a cleric and a GOOD cleric. Few people really understand how to use a healer effectively, and those who don't use a cleric that benefits others is playing a cleric that isn't EQ ideal. I have a 14th level cleric, and I can tell you that playing a cleric seriously is a difficult and draining experience. When you really care about your group members and really do your best to be a good cleric, EQ turns into either a night of terror or a night of celebration. And I hate bad nights. O-k, so maybe I'm just an overly sensitive user, but I've noticed that when I play my cleric effectively I make a crap load of friends, allies, and gain huge experience and loot. As of now, I've had the longest friends list that I've ever had playing any other character. My point is, I think everyone here is right in one way or the other, but I think I can sum up what everyone is saying in just 2 simple rules regarding the use of a cleric: RULE #1 ... Close combat should be reserved only for soloing or when grouping with few players. Another exception is if you are grouping with casters primarily. Why a cleric would want to group only with casters is beyond me, but I have experimented with the idea on occasion, and I can tell you that if you do plan to do it ... well, plan on being the tank, bub. A cleric, when it comes to close combat, is little more than a weak fighter. Sure, a cleric can be effective in close combat, but you better be grouped with people that have lots of patience because you're not going to do much damage. In fact, chances are, the casters in your group are going to do more damage, which means that the monsters are going to leave you alone real quick and make a B-line for your weakly clad casters. Doh! ... All this brings me to my next rule of thumb, RULE #2: I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but every spell a cleric has is situation based. In other words, you don't really know the true effectiveness of a spell until you're in a situation that calls for its use. The trick is this: know which spell is most effective for a given situation AND anticipate what situations might arrive so you can have the necessary spells memorized in your gem slots. The only way you're going to anticipate what spells will be needed is to get to know an area. I always solo an area carefully before I group in that same area. Why? That way I know what's there and have a pretty good idea as to what buffs and attack spells I'm gonna need when I bring my fellow adventurers in. For example, Protection from Fire for an area plagued by monsters that breathe fire, Ward Undead for an area plagued by undead; etc. Nothing is worse than having a total party wipeout (TPW) because I didn't have a spell memorized in time that could've saved some lives and experience. But knowing what spells work best for what areas also applies to specific situations. For instance, if your party is at an orc camp, and you know the camp has lots of Oracles, maybe you should think about memming a stun spell to keep the enemy caster from casting. Root spell is real handy when you're in an open area where wounded monsters that are chased can break up the group and leave others vulnerable. Also, if you're pulling monsters that swarm, I suggest memming Fear spell. I once saved my party from a TPW because I kept the resistance to a minimum using Fear--there were 3 of us and we killed thrice as many Centurions. As my party member once put it: "There were few of us, but we killed many." Nothing is more satisfying than knowing your brains and talent made the day. So chapter summary, right? Well, basically, my point is that what separates a good cleric from the bad and the ugly is a cleric that uses a lot of love and a lot of tactics. Know your spells and know your area. Also, show a genuine concern for your party, but express that concern by not being stupid. Pay attention. The cleric that spends time sniffing daisies and playing fighter is the cleric that gets the cold shoulder. You've placed a huge burden on your shoulders once you've taken that oath to serve your god or goddess in the realm of Norrath. When the night is over, if you're not sweating from the responsibility of saving lives or bored from the incredible effectiveness of your ingenuity, you've messed up somewhere. It's like a car mechanic that comes home with clean hands ... something just ain't right.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>You go girl.  =P<br><br>Some other things to point out;<br><br>/em clears his throat....<br>A lot of people out there don't know how to play their class, let alone another they've never even tried.  I once grouped with a ShadowKnight (We were all mid 20's in the group, at the Sarnak Fort in LOIO) who did not know what a Cleric was....<br>And this left me wondering...how did someone survive to their mid twenties and have NEVER heard of a Cleric?  It's all situational.  This was probably someone who went out, bought the game, and made an Iksar as his first character.  Nothing wrong with that, but he (Like me) had probably soloed his way up to there.  (I soloed until 21, when I started seriously grouping).  And having been born and raised in Cabilis, the only healer class he would have ever encountered was a Shaman, who many times at our level still try to melee.  Anyway, my point is this.<br>If you come across an uneducated person, try to teach them how you work.  If they don't know the full abilities of a Cleric, then they will get people killed.  Explain to them that you DON'T melee, that you sit on your butt to buff and heal people.<br>Also, I've sat groups down and explained to them how other classes play, too.  I had to halt the pulls from one group because our Chanter almost died; the Ranger was NOT assisting, and kept breaking mez.  So since out Enchanter wouldn't tell them what was up, (She was SOOOOO nice, to a fault.  =P)  I did.<br>I also, at lower levels, grouped with a monk who didn't know what mana was.../sigh<br>Anyway, I was the same myself.  I learned a lot from an Enchantress I grouped with in my low teens.  She had a high level Cleric alt, and taught me everything I know, even some stuff I can't do yet because they involve spells I don't have yet.  =P<br>I've been put in situations where I only had enough mana to cast one heal, but two people were dying...sometimes you have to let that happen...so you pick the more important group member.  Don't let your tank die to save someone who can't absorb damage anyway; you lose your tank you lose your group.  It's all a matter of situation.  In higher levels you'll be wanting to save the wizzie/druid, so they can evac out.  I've been told that in this case, you cast an area effect or group heal (This'll taunt most anything onto you), cast Divine Aura to go invincible, and be ready to click it off a few seconds before the wizzie/druid's port spell is complete.  (If you're invincible, then the port will not take you.  You don't want to be left behind.  =P)<br><br>Anyway, enough rambling from me...<br><br>Jarochai Alabaster<br>28th Dwarven Cleric of Brell Serelis<br>Proud member of Exile<br>Brell Serelis server<br><br>Anyone have any questions, pop into brell and /who me.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Well, (takes a DEEP breath), some good some bad being said here.  I'm only a beginning cleric, although I have a high level Shadow Knight and have grouped with many GOOD Clerics.<br><br>First Clerics always melee, the good ones tell the group theyy will be doing it ahead of time, but they all have to melee at every level.  If you don't melee your defense skills fall behind and when you agro a MOB (and you will) at level 40, if your defense is not max YOU WILL DIE.  Even a 45 SK with HT and Desease cloud can't taunt off a MOB once your life drops below half from a couple of solid hits from an enraged MOB.  Use moderation, once your defense skills max for level then you can sit on youe rear through the whole fight, but keep defense MAXED!<br><br>Next, use your full range of spells, a Cleric is not just a healer.  If you have someone that can snare and are fighting outdoors use fear.  Fear Kiting is a tremendus life saver.  If the MOB isn't hitting anyone then you don't need to heal them.  A Cleric fears as well as a Necro or SK, so use it if you can.  <br><br>Stun and Root can also be effective, but Root takes a tremendous amount of mana, use it sparingly, and remember a rooted MOB never turns and stops hitting the tanks, it is sometimes counter productive (especially if its already snared and someone is fearing).<br><br>Smite:  another great spell if used properly, just remember your not a Wizard.<br><br>Healing, bread and butter stuff here.  If people are yelling for a heal your wrong.  But conversly letting a Warrior get below 2 bubbles of health is sometimes a good thing (berzerker furry).  I've seen Tanks request to be kept between 1 and 2 bubbles of life for this reason.  If they trust the Cleric this is a good thing, but until you earn the tanks trust don't try this.  Healing is an art, i never worry about my life when I am grouped with my regular Cleric, I've been below 1/2 a bubble of life and didn't even consider asking for a heal, I knew it was coming.  He also knows when he yells "On Me" I'm GOING to pull the thing off quick, even if I have to HT it.  <br><br>GOOD Clerics are a great asset and don't freelance alot because a GOOD group is hard to find for them too.  Any cleric at lvl 40+ thats looking for a pickup group is immediately suspect to me.  I know our Cleric can't log on more than 10 minutes without us asking him if he needs to get a ride to join us.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
