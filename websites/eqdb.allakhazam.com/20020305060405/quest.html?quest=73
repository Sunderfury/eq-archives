Here are the steps to complete the quest:                                                    <br>1.  Speak to Lord Qyzar (2nd floor SK guild on balcony) ask him about a [matter of betrayal} he will mention the Hero Goxnox is investigating the issue, and you should meet him at once. <br><br>2.  Dash down to the bottom of the tower closest to where you and the lord are speaking (westward).  At the bottom you will see that "an iksar crusader" has spawned. <br><br>3.  Greet him as follows: "hail Goxnox" he will explain about the [traitor] and the [charasis tome]. Follow the ladder of chat until you say "I am ready to depart".  He will then give u a SILVER COIN and tell you to meet him at the skinless outpost (which is in FV) <br><br>4.  Get some Sow potions if possible and head to Firiona Vie. You begin by going SW from the Lake of Ill Omen until you hit a cliff area and a few rocks (there should be others camping Drovargs a few steps away ... go invis... When you reach this point, at a larger rock, you should find "tracker azreal" <br><br>5-Only attempt the following at Night (7ish game time).   Remove your invis and con the tracker from far away. If he cons "scowl" wait for the next one.  (It may be that both are present all the time, but one is just invisible).  If he cons "indifferent", then it's the Hero Goxnox in disquise. You have to do the next part quick because pilgrims and drixies love to wander past this area.  Hand "tracker azreal" the SILVER COIN" and it will say "Tracker Azreal begins to pull off his face... It is a disquise! AHA! You have made it! "I cannot see well in this disquise, but, I thought I smelled you. I have [news of the Charasis Tome] <br><br>6.  Ask him "what news of the charasis tome" and he will then reply: "The Charasis Tome has been scribed and now another copy exists. The traitor obviously wants to keep a copy for himself. I am told you will deliver both copies to Lord Qyzar along with your Zealot Khukri and you shall be awarded that of a crusader. Let us rest for a minute, and then I shall show you the meeting place" <br><br>7.  Here's where you must be sowed.  You will follow Hero Goxnox straight through FV. I recommend using a far awat camera angle (F9) to avoid any suprising MoBs. <br><br>8.  Eventually, he will stop and say: "Look!! there past the wolf people, near an ancient tunnel can be found the meeting place. I fear we may be too late. I thought I saw a shodow dash from the tunnels, but, I did not see any of the spider riders. We will see when we reach it. (follow him once again) <br><br>9.  Now you will confront the "drachnid spy".  Make sure that when you are fighting it you remain FAR way from the posted Drovargs near the tunnel's entrance. The Drachnid spy will say "You shall not take the tome from me!! I shall snack upon your blood drained corpse. <br><br>10.  Slay the drachnid spy.  During the fight, you should take note that Hero Goxnox has been healing the drachnid spy. After you loot the CHARASIS TOME from the drachnid spy's corpse, Hero Goxnox will say : He sighs slowly, seeing the confusion on your face. He says "Yes (your name here), I am the traitor. What I can gain by giving up this tome outweighs and patriotic obligations, I may have once had. That city is dead, it is now time for you to choose Iksar. You can walk away and never speak of this to anyone.... or you can die...what will it be? <br><br>11.  Slay hero goxnox (be cautious of his harm touch).  Loot his corpse. Grab the CHARASIS TOME COPY and the FS weapon (a few pp can never hurt).  Proceed back WEST to LOIO and back to the city of Cabilis, SHD guild, second floor (lord Qyzar) <br><br>12.  Hand in the 2 copies of the tome, and your Zealot Khukri, and finally...you will own a CRUSADER KHUKRI.<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I ran this quest at 39 just like Jhogo said...He is right is much easier and the posted LOCs are right on.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only info I would add is this.  The pilgrims were blue to me at 39 and I had one attack me just as Tracker Azreal approached the first meeting place.  Azreal conned red and indifferent at this point but he still assisted the pilgrim.  My Fd failed and I was dead before I could recast it.  He tripple pierced me for 130 pts damage several times.  However, he stood over my corpse long enough for me to run back through swamp of no hope and FV (without SOW) loot the coin and hand it to him.  I then looted the rest of my gear and ran to the drovlog underground entrance and he was alreadt there with the spy.  I killed the spy,looted, killed Groxnok and pet, looted and headed north back to SONH and got the Khukri.  One step closer to greenmist.  Good luck fellow SKs.<br><br>  <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I did this quest at lvl 39.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my way is similar, yet a bit less nervwracking than the way we were told to do it in other posts. <br>I left Cabilis and ran SE through Swamp of No Hope to the SE zone into FV.  I play on Sullon Zek, so I not only had to beware MOBs that see invis, but other players as well.  I cast Gather Shadows, and zoned into FV, ran due south to the coast, then proceded west to the boulder where Goxnox is sitting disguised as Tracker Azreal (approx neg 2550, neg 1550).  I droped invis and conned the tracker and he was indifferent, so I ran up and handed him the coin.  I then hailed him and asked &quot;What news of the Charasis Tome?&quot;  He said his bit and said we would rest there for a bit.  A minute or so later, he took off.  I chose not to follow him all through FV, because on my server, as I noted before, it is just too dangerous because of enemy PKers.  As he skittered off into the distance, I ran to the Drolvarg Tunnel entrance of the east wall of the zone (approx pos 560, neg 1760).  I did not have sow, so it took me a couple minutes to find my way there.  Goxnox was already there with a pet and the Drachnid Spy.  At lvl 39, the Spy was light blue con, and Goxnox was a green con.  The spider conned amiable, so I ran up and hailed Goxnox.  He admitted to being in league with the enemy, so I killed the Spy, looted the tome, then turned to Goxnox.  I attacked Goxnox, and got him to half health when I was overrun by a few blue-con drachnids that wandered by, and just befor I could kill Goxnox, they dropped me.  I of course paniced, and ran naked back through the swamp to FV the way I had before.  I looted my corpse, but Goxnox was nowhere to be found.  I went back to Cabilis to the SK guild and asked Lord Qyzar &quot;What matter of betrayal&quot; again, and then ran down to the iksar crusader, hailed him, said &quot;I am ready to depart&quot;, and he handed me the silver coin again.  I AGAIN ran back to FV through the Swamp, then on to the boulder where Tracker Azreal was sitting, found him to be indifferent, and handed him the coin again.  Thankfully, it worked and he revealed himself as Goxnox again, and I again said &quot;What news of the Charasis Tome?&quot;  He said we would rest, then after a minute or two, wandered off into FV agin.  I had sow this time, so I took off straight to the tunnel and beat him there.  I waited around a few minutes and was just beginning to panic when he walked up, cast a pet and the Drachnid Spy popped in.  I walked up to him, Hailed him and again he said he was in league with the enemy.  Now, I had the tome from the Spy from my first attempt, so I feared the Spy, Feared Goxnox's pet, and killed Gox.  He had the tome, so I happily ran back to Cabilis to turn in the 2 tomes and my Khukri and got my reward!  The Crusader Khukri.  8/26 3 Int  3 MR  3 PR.  Hope this helps you out, especially those of you who have to try this quest more than once due to death.  Good Luck.<br><br>Jhogo J'Godon<br>39 SK on Sullon Zek<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Tracker Azreal (aka Hero Goxnok) spawn = neg 2553 by neg 1546 (by a rock at the edge of the cliff)<br><br>Drachnid Spy spawn = pos 657 by neg 1762 (right in front of the drolvarg temple area)<br><br>Other points of interest ...<br><br>Almost everything sees through invis.<br><br>Once you give the tracker (he'll con indifferent) your coin, he'll take about 5 minutes to FINALLY get to the drolvarg tunnel. Trust me, standing in the middle of a dangerous area waiting for him to move is a particularly delightful experience ... if you're a masochist!!!<br><br>Pilgrims and drixies assist ... count yourself VERY lucky if you get to the tunnel area without picking up a straggler.<br><br>Hero Goxnok WILL attack if he is blue to you. If he is green, he will instead heal the spider during the fight.<br><br>You will need the drops off both Hero Goxnok AND the Drachnid Spy. Make sure to keep them both alive (if a pilgrim attacks) ... so YOU can kill them! :)<br><br>**********<br><br>On to the particulars of the hunt. I, Raduus Cryptreaver (level 46 iksar monk) just helped my friend Mikazu (level 35 iksar shadowknight) finish this quest. Honestly, the most difficult part was avoiding those stupid drixies and pilgrims. They assist and heal, and the fights go on WAY too long. Throw in a damage shield, and it's a recipe for disaster! Because we didn't have a clear loc where the tracker spawned, we had to run back and forth along the cliff area, and were jumped pretty much non-stop by drolvargs, pilgrims, drixies, pirates, and even goblins. Most distressing.<br><br>Anyhoo, in a HUGE bit of serendipity, I happened upon the Drixie Queen (for the dreadscale mask quest) and finished her off lickity split. A nice bonus, as Mikazu has now finished her Dreadscale armor collection. :)<br><br>When the actual fight began in front of the drolvarg tunnel, the hero led off with a harm touch against Mikazu. We also had a pilgrim add. *sigh* I tried to move to where I was taking the hits, but all the baddies seemed quite intent on finishing poor Mikazu off. We had finished off the Hero (who was green to me at level 46) when I notice Mikazu was pretty much out of health! I desperately called to her to feign death ... which she did ... with 10 hit points left!<br><br>At this point I feigned death as well, leaving the drachnid spy to fight again *two* pilgrims. It finished off one and was engaging the second when Mikazu told me &quot;We need the tome off the spy!!!&quot;<br><br>Well, needless to say I sprang up and aided the spy in its battle against the pilgrim. No contest, as the puny wood elf fell quickly.<br><br>As the battle ended, the spy turned to me and smiled. A sickly smile. I like to think it knew that it was about to die. With a fierce battle cry I flung myself into battle! Mikazu stood up and aided in the battle. Within seconds, we stood victorious among the bodies of our foes.<br><br>Returning to Cabilis, Mikazu was proclaimed a hero of the Iksar, and I, Raduus Cryptreaver, stood proudly by as my friend received her just reward ... a shiny new Crusader's Khukri. :)<br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Sun Jan 13 00:17:17 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Actually if you have killed A LOT of goblins it's possible you could not be kos to the outpost at FV but I mean A LOT of goblins, probably something like 800.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, if you are KOS remember that SOME of the drixies and pilgrims can see invis.  They also hate wolf form so don't expect to find some dr00d to save you from them.  It may be easier to zone into FV from the swamp of no hope, there are two ways to zone to FV from the swamp and one puts you pretty close to the shore AND on the opposide side of the zone from all the drixies and the outpost, this should be an easier way than coming in from LoIL as this is also the side of the zone where our Tracker Azreal shows up.  While I'm mentioning dangers and such remember that all of the drolvarg I've ever seen and a few of the drachnids see invis so try to avoid the drolvarg if you can and con the spiders so you can avoid any that don't con indifferent.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>If you've ever gone on killing sprees in N Ro, you might know what I'm talking about. Upon killing Dorn Bdynn out of boredom one night, I was suprised by the spawning of a Dark Elf Spy or something of the sort. I killed him, and suddenly a little spider darted out of the corpse. It was also scowling at me. I killed that too, but rather than getting Neriak faction hits, I got Mistmoore. The only other spiders I could think of involving MM faction were the Drachnids from DL and the FV landscape. Hrmm, whadda ya know? Charasis tome! It's written in . . . some language I don't know, but my Iksar Monk friend got one also, and he could read it fine. I don't know if this is the same thing, but it might help. I know that killing Dorn doesn't always trigger the spawn of the Spy, and killing the spy doesn't always trigger the spider. I also know that some items may have the same name, apperance, and writing on them, but might be for entirely different quests. IE, the testament of truth droped off of the guy in Lava Storm is not the same as the one dropped off Lucan or the one quested for in N FP. I hope this does more good than harm.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First of all the first person you see is Arch Duke Xog and he says to find Argest who has been captured, killed or digested in Frontier Mountain. Many people have gone down to the jail in Droga and indicated they found either the guy for the Monk shackle quest or another Iksar in bluish armor who doesn't really respond to anything. There is also another Iksar there in yellow (crazed something) who attacks on sight. It turns out there are at least 4 different prisoners there and Argest doesn't spawn until late game night. About 8pm game time the mobs in the cell despawn and if you have killed the crazed when they respawn either you get the crazed and the shackle guy, the crazed and the no comment guy or Argest and one of the others. The way you can tell Argest is he has gold colored chain armor on. Asking him the usual questions gets some response. <br>What he wants is the three keys to get out of jail. The two keys to the inner and outer doors spawn from the Penmaster outside the doors. He doesn't spawn until the afternoon game time and if you kill him and his place holder (a spider) you will get at least three and maybe 4 spawns between noon and when Argest spawns. The Penmaster alternatly drops a no drop bone key and a no drop bone neclace. The necklace is the key to the outer of the two doors and the bone key is the key to the inner of the two doors. Kill him and loot these keys. <br>Now when Aregest talks to you he says that the reason he was here was to find the Stupendous Machine (it is in another cell and Verant renamed it Always Works, they SHOULD have redone the quest spam). He has a part to make the machine work and he will give it to you when you give him the three keys. He also tells you that you must find the scrolls of Vok Na Zov and combine them in the machine to make them readable before the quest for Greenmist can go forward. He says you should tell Arch Duke Xog about the scrolls. <br><br>When you do tell the Arch Duke he says that if you bring him a readable set of the scrolls of Vok Na Zov and your Hero Kukhri he will give you the "grand Lord Khukri". <br><br>Now for the scrolls of Vok Na Zov. Argest says they are in Kaesora. Well only one is. It is on the Failed Crypt Raider in the library. He drops an Illegible Scroll which when you cast ID on it is Scroll of Vok Na Zov I. There is also a note on his body which says that there are three scrolls on the Spectral Courier in a city of name with a T???? that I don't remember at the current time, but it is City of Mist anyway. The T???? is the original name for the city. When he dies he says something like "I will never feel the mist on my skin again." This is VERY obscure but will come into play later. <br><br>The guy in CoM spawns in the stables (go left after the gate all the way to the side and then left again into the stables). When you go to CoM the Spectral Courier is in a room with a huge crowd of spawns, about half green and half blue to a level 50 SK. You will need a good party to kill him three times, if you are lucky and you get no duplicates. You don't need to identify them as they are no drop lore and you can not pick them up if you already have one. It took me four kills to get all three. I never figured out who his placeholder was so just kill all the stuff in the stables. <br><br>So now where are the other two? Well they are in Mistmoore, and this is where the obscure comment came into play. So go to MM and go near the Princess room there is a short hallway and a door to two bedrooms. During the night time nothing spawns but undead, but during the day the Assistant Dark Librarian spawns in the left bedroom. I waited forever for the Dark Librarian to spawn in the other bedroom and she never did. She spawned in the library on the second floor near the back. They drop scrolls V and VI. <br><br>Now you have everthing but the key to Pen #1 that Argest has to have to give you the part to make the machine work. I thought about this for some time and finally decided that it had to be dropped from the Goblin Coerced Penkeeper in Dalnir. It seems there are two different spawns in Dalnir of the Coerced Penkeeper. I camped both of them and so far only got a Nickel key to drop. When you cast ID on it it ID's as "Coppernickel key(..1)". This led me to believe it is the correct key for Pen #1 (name is close with the 1 in it). But when you try it on the door to the cell with Argest it doesn't work. Giving it to Argest doesn't get any response other than "we had a deal get me the right key" or words to that effect. <br><br>I can not think of any other key it could be, this is the only one that makes sense. In my opinion it is broken, but then maybe there is another key or maybe the Coerced drops a different key if you camp him long enough. <br><br>I apologize for the lack of posting the quest spam and the lack of a final conclusion, but there it is - after 6 months we can get moving a little bit and maybe we can get a response on the key being fixed. If it does spawn elsewhere there are no hints I have seen and no one has reported a Key to Pen #1 on any boards I have found. Good luck guys and let this poor little Iksar girl know if you find the right key someplace. <br><br><br>Seku, 51st level Reaver and proud member of Celestial Tomb on Veeshan<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>wqe need this item for the next khurkri- i copied and pasterd here for referance:<br>BTW this is VERY tough at 39 IMO..although it is a level 25ish quest:<br><br><br>I decided to try the quest again for the Visceral Dagger, and after some effort was successful. <br><br>I am Necromancer level 45. Currently I use a Gnoll Hide Tome and Stein of Moggok most of the time, so getting the dagger was not all-important. Nonetheless something that doesn't lower STR is handy to have (GHT lowers STR by 10). <br><br>The three Kly Imprecators are uncommon. I believe it takes luck and patience to endure the camping. The Blacksmith is common. <br><br>I arrived in the morning outside Dalnir, DMFed, and Invised. Went straight to the 2nd floor down to pool area and on to shackle room for first Imprecator. Summoned pet. After 3 placeholders he appeared, got the No Drop Hilt (looks like a tube). The placeholders were Goo, a Kly Follower, and a Nibbler (all green to level 45). No robe dropped, however the Imprecator did have FS and an Ancient Coin. In same room another mob spawns (for me was first a Kly and then a Coerced Erudite). <br><br>Down I went to church area. Kly Imprecator or placeholder spawns directly behind table. I went into "safe room" next to church to summon pet. I began clearing room, working my way to back, pulling to safe room. A random 'wanderer' paths to between 'safe' room and church. Kill this to avoid problems. <br><br>PET CONTROL IS ESSENTIAL! You must not allow pet to get pulled into or near church from "safe room", or it will die, followed by you. This happened to me three times due to lag, at which point I decided not to bother clearing room. <br><br>I realized I could single pull the Imrecator or placeholder once I ensured remaining Kly were not Kly Evokers. I am guessing Evokers are a higher level than the rest (Follower, Believer, Cohort) as they would aggro on a pull. When pulling with Dooming Darkness I was able to not get aggroed on at all by casting from outside aggro radius. <br><br>Here is where the pet control comes in: the casters being pulled will nuke or root you, and pet will barrel into church. Hot key "/pet back off" and be sure to use it to keep fight in the relatively "safe room". This means taking some spell damage, until target is in safe room and in melee range of pet. Of course lower than level 45 means that the single pull might not be possible. <br><br>While there drops were FS, lots of coin, a Sarnak Pitchatka(unsure of spelling: a 1H Slash weapon, looks like claw), 2 pieces of the no drop Crescent armor, and when Imprecator finally popped the item for dagger quest. <br><br>The church was longest camp for me. Did about 6 placeholders, then stopped for lunch. Went back a few hours later, did about 8 placeholders, stopped for dinner. Afterwards returned,and after about 10 placeholders the Imprecator finally appeared. About five of the kills were /con blue, and maybe four greenies gave exp. <br><br>Off I went to the lab area. While invised I watched a few minutes to observe the pathing of the wanderers. Between the water and the 'doorway' to lab/beds area I summoned pet and cleared wanderers. Again, pet control was key to ensure it was single pulls. <br><br>Once the wanderers were cleared I moved into lab room where Imprecator spawns (left side lab). There are two Kly in this room, and to break it I just rushed in and had pet on one and used Screaming Terror on the other. <br><br>The spawn interval in the lab room seemed about 15 minutes. All mobs /conned in and around here were green to me, although two did give experience. After about seven placeholders the Imprecator finally appeared. Loot was some coin, some FS, and the item needed for quest when Imprecator finally spawned. He also had an Ancient Coin and a tube of somekind for a different quest. <br><br>Months ago I had already gotten the Forged Hammer of Dalnir from the blacksmith, so I was able to skip that part. Once invised I went to the Always Works Forge and combined all four components. The Visceral Dagger was the result. <br><br>Spell used: Dead Man Floating, Gather Shadows, Harmshield, Feign Death, Screaming Terror, Call of Bones, Cackling Bones, Dooming Darkness, Torbas Acid Blast, Drain Spirit, Vampiric Curse, Steelskin/Diamondskin. <br><br>Hope that helps <br><br>Tenelin V`Ryl <br>(Lanys T`Vyl server) <br><br>PS Thanks to Kenolyen for the company, good luck, and assistance during latter part of camp. <br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>YO! the MoB quest is now working heres the spoiler if u guys don't know what to do yet...<br><br>1-speak to Lord Qyzar ( 2nd floor SK guild on balcony ) ask him about a [matter of betrayal} he will mention the Hero Goxnox is investigatin the issue, and you shouild meet him at once.<br><br>2-Dash down to the bottom of the tower closest to where you and the lord are speaking (westward) at the bottom you will see that "an iksar crusader" has spawned.<br><br>3-greet him as follows: "hail Goxnox" he will explain about the [traitor] and the [charasis tome] follow the ladder of chat until you say "I am ready to depart"-he will then give u a SILVER COIN and want to meet you at the skinless outpost (which is in FV)<br><br>4-GET A FEW SOW POTIONS AND BUFFS...even at level 41 i had trouble with this part of the quest. You begin by going SW from LOIO to you hit a cliff area and a few rocks (there should be others camping Drovargs a few steps away (good to get buffs from btw)) the loc is ABOUT -200, -200 i think... go invis... when u reach this point, at a larger rock, should be "tracker azreal"<br><br>5-ONLY ATTEMPT the following at NIGHT (7ish game time) remove yur invis, and con the tracker from far away. if he cons "scowl" wait for the next one, if he cons "indifferent" than it's the Hero Goxnox in disquise. you gotta do the next part quick because pilgrims and drixies love to wander past this area. hand "tracker azreal" the SILVER COIN" and it'll say.... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tracker Azreal beginsd to pull off his face... It is a disquise! AHA! You have made it! "I cannot see well in this disquise, but, i thought i smelled you. I have [news of the Charasis Tome]<br><br>6- ask him "what news of the charasis tome" eh will then reply: "The Charasis Tome has been scribed and now another copy exists. The traitor obviously wants to keep a copy for himself. I am toldt you will deliver both copies to Lord Qyzar along with your Zealot Khukri and you shall be awarded that of a crusader. Let us rest for a minute, and then I shall show you the meeting place"<br><br>7- here's where you MUST be sowed. you will follow Hero Goxnox straight through FV. I recommend using a far awat camera angle (F9) to avoid any suprising MoBs. <br><br>8- Eventually, he will stop and say: "Look!! there past the wolf people, near an ancient tunnel can be found the meeting place. I fear we may be too late. I thought I saw a shodow dash from the tunnels, but, I did not see any of the spider riders. We will see when we reach it. (follow him once again)<br><br>-9 OK. now u will confront the "drachnid spy" make sure when u are fighting it. you remain FAR way from the posted Drovargs near the tunnel's entrance. The Drachnid spy will say "You shall not take the tome from me!! I shall snack upon your blood drained corpse.<br><br>-10 slay the drachnid spy. during the fight, you should take note that Hero Goxnox has been healing the drachnid spy. After you loot the CHARASIS TOME from the drachnid spy's corpse, Hero Goxnox will say : He sighs slowly, seeing the confusion on your face. He says "Yes (your name here), I am the traitor. What I can gain by giving up this tome outweighs and patriotic obligations, I may have once had. That city is dead, it is now time for you to choose Iksar. You can walk away and never speak of this to anyone.... or you can die...what will it be?<br><br>-11 slay hero goxnox (be cautious of his harmtouch) He whoudl go down kinda quick. Finally loot his corpse. Grab the CHARASIS TOME COPY and the FS weapon (a few pp can never hurt) proceed back WEST to LOIO and back to the city of Cabilis, SHD guild, second floor (lord Qyzar)<br><br>-12 hand in the 2 copies of the tome, and your Zealot Khukri, and finally...you will own a CRUSADER KHUKRI<br><br>good luck <br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
