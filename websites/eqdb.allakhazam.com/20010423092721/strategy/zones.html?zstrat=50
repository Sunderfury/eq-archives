	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ok, so there are many strategies for defeating Lord Nagafen. Let's discuss a few. I just particpated in his slaying for the first time today. All i can say is that for 60 people our stategy seemed highly inefficiant. As a matter of fact too many died. I'm under the impression that we had way too many. I think that 4 (maybe 3 or even 2) well balanced and "talented groups" could take Naggy with little difficulty. The key seems to be resists. Bards (with their resist song) and Druids (with Circle of winter) are crucial even though i'm sure there are ways around having them i.e. good resist items and other class buffs. Naggy also has an aoe fear that can be resisted with the /disc fear and a good MR. AS far as melee, i had NPC hitting me off, but he seemed to be do little more damage than a common wurm (100-200 points of damage).I thought he cast Rain of Fire once, but with all the resists it was barely noticable. <br><br>Most of the people on our raid died because of mass confusion regarding heals. Very few remained as Nagafen fell. Again, I think that fewer people with more skill would have little to no problem taking down this dragon. Although i wasn't keeping track, he didn't seem to have many hit points and fell rather quickly.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Be very, very, very careful when zoning into Nagafen's Lair. If at all possible, I'd recommend doing so from Solusek A, the zone that leads directly to the Window Room in B. The reason for this is simple. There is, rarely, a Lava Duct Crawler that spawns near the zone line and starts ripping everyone who zones in to shreds while they're vulnerable. He wanders away, but while he's there you can kiss your casters goodbye if they zone first.<br><br>I have also heard that, extremely rarely, the Noxious spider will spawn there. Even worse, for those zoning in, but the only time I can personally claim to have seen this happen was right after the Hole was added, and SolB was a lot buggy for a while after that. This little problem might have been fixed, but it's something to be aware of just in case.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Fire giants are some of the most challenging monsters for their level range. Immune to magic cast from outside their melee range, giant flagged (meaning they cannot be stunned or mesmerized), with respectable melee damage and health, they can be daunting foes. However, there are additional hazards to fighting them simply given the terrain. A fire giant must never, under any circumstances, be bashed into a wall or allowed to enter lava.<br><br>When a fire giant enters a wall, I have heard that it removes all debuffs upon it and heals fully. While I haven't seen this happen to fire giants, I have seen it with ice giants in permafrost. However, there is an additional hazard here that I was able to experience first hand. Once, a fire giant was knocked into a wall... and it never came back. We waited for it, then all camped out and reentered to eliminate hate. No trace of it. We all thought it must have destroyed itself, and continued as normal. The next pull of fire giants consisted of around 9 fire giants. Every pull thereafter, until the zone was repopped due to a patch, was that way. I believe that the fire giant was possibly stuck under the world, aggro'd during any pull but unmoving, and pulled just about every giant in the vicinity during a pull. In any case, that one little fire giant wiped out at least two subsequent raids after ours.<br><br>Giants can also be knocked into the lava. While I've heard similar things about them healing, I haven't been able to verify this. They can, however, summon people to them while merrily fighting people inside lava. While I suppose a group with heat resistances of 160+ (due to bards or just great equipment) might be able to carry the fight to the giant inside the lava, it generally just means the clerics should camp and hopefully you'll have a necro to retrieve corpses lying at the bottom of a lava pool.<br><br>Further miscellaneous notes on fire giants. The first room has 3 fire giants, one of whom is a roamer. If you float across the lava from near stone spider room, you can come out behind the giants, kill the roamer, then face the remaining two. Feign-pulling makes life much easier. I preferred having two feign pullers to make things go smoother. Enchanters level 49 or higher can charm fire giants with Allure, although the casting time of their charm makes it nearly impossible to charm a fire giant that is beating on them (unless it is slowed) - two enchanters trying to charm a single giant generally will work, as one of them tanks it and the other gets Allure off uninterrupted. Slowing the giant with either their own slow spells or the stronger insects line of shamans will also allow them uninterrupted charms. It's a good idea to have along a shaman regardless, due to the power of their insects line and additional hp buffs on tanks. In a pinch, root-parking giants -can- work. Rooted npcs don't summon, so if you park a fire giant warrior far enough out of melee range, you may be able to keep him out of the fight. Keep in mind that there are fire giant magi, and root parking them isn't nearly as effective.<br><br>It seems like the most troublesome pull is Magi Rokyll and the giants with him should Lord Nagafen be up and about. If Nagafen is dead, this isn't a problem at all. If he's alive and well, the pull of Magi Rokyll can be difficult enough that some groups just stop at Warlord Skarlon and leave.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This has to be one of my favorite zones to hunt in between levels 35 and 45.  Not only is the experience great here, but the loot is great for these levels.  <br><br>common mobs<br><br>Near the zone, in the pool room, and in the noble room is where the Greater Kobolds spawn.  Greater kobolds are good experience all the way into the 40's in a group and great solo experience as high as level 46 (when some of them become green).  GK's (as they are called by many) can drop up to 5PP worth of coins, Fine Steel (FS) weapons, medium sized Bronze armor, Poison components (which are stackable and sell for about 1PP apiece to vendors), and various research components.<br><br>In the area called the King Room, and as the placeholder for the Kobold Noble, are where the Solusek Kobolds spawn.  SK's (another slang term) are very good group experience all the way up to level 50 and great solo experience (if you can pull them.. which is tricky) clear into the low 50's.  They drop all the same loot as the GK's but with more frequency.<br><br>Farther down into Sol B, past the kobolds is the area called "Bats and Bugs" because it is populated mostly by Sonic Bats, Lava Beetles, and Lava Duct Crawlers (spiders).  This area is exeptional experience, for a group that can handle it, Clear into the low 50's and good solo experience until the mid 50's.  The loot isn't as good down here as it is off the kobolds, but they still drop up to 5PP worth of coin and research components.<br><br>Past the Bats and Bugs, there are two ways to go (basically.. there are lots of tunnels but they all lead to one of these two places) The Efreeti, and Nagenfer.<br><br>The route to the Efreeti is populated by Lava Guardians (fire elementals) and Imps.  This is Quite possibly the best experience in all of Sol B, and also has really good loot.  I would reccomend going with someone who knows the area though, cause it is very dangerous if you are not prepared.  The imps and elementals are great experience all the way until the high 50's and I know a few people who have solo killed them (with help.. they are tough) all the way to 60.  They drop up to 6PP, FS weapons, and research components also.<br><br>The Last area, the road to Naggy (as he is commonly referred to as) is where the Fire Giants of Sol B live.  The fire giants give good experience, but due to thier long spawn times, are not that efficient to hunt for experience.  The main reason to hunt the Fire giants is for thier loot.  The normal fire giants drop up to 30PP and thier toes (used for magician quest) and research components.  <br><br>Named Spawns<br><br>The Noble<br>Just to the right of the entrance (from Lavastorm) is the spawn known as the Noble room.  The noble is a high level enchanter with a pet who sits in this room guarded by numerous GK's.  The noble is Tough to fight, mainly because he likes to charm members of your party and send them against you.  Give your group a good MR spell and you should have no problem taking him down.  He drops the Petrified Erudite Heart Amulet as his rare drop, and the Staff of Writhing as his common.<br><br>The King<br>Just to the left of the same entrance, and up a big circular stairway, is the lair of the Solusek King.  He is a high level Shadow Knight and is a very dangerous adversary.  His room is usually camped at the same time as the priest room and the champion room (which are all right next to each other) He hits very hard, has a pet, casts some pretty mean dot's and HT's.   His rare drop is the Fleshripper, and his common drop is the Runed Mithril Bracer<br><br>The Priest<br>Next to the king, behind an illusionary wall, is the Priest spawn.  The priest is a healer, hits fairly hard, and complete heals himself if given the chance.  If you keep him stunned he is an easy kill.  His rare drop is the Mithril Breasplate, and his common are the Carnal Pauldrons.<br><br>The Champion<br>Next to the priest, and viewable from the king's room, is the Solusek Champion.  The champion is a high level warrior, and hits about as hard as the king.  He is the easiest of the 3 to kill, and has the poorest loot (in my opinion) his rare drop is the Painbringer sword, and his common drop is the Shield of the Slain Unicorn<br><br>The Guano Harvester<br>Down in the bats and bugs area, sometimes instead of a bat or a bug spawning, a goblin spawns.  This is the guano harvester.  He has no set spot or time to spawn, so catching him relies purely on luck.  Also, as soon as he spawns, he turns himself invisible, so if you are in this area try and keep a see invis on at least one person int he group.  He is extremely easy to kill and has some incredible drops.  His rare drop is the Cloak of Shadows and his common drop is the soiled bag.<br><br>The Death Beetle<br>On the way to the efreeti lord, is the death beetle room.  The death beetle is a named lava beetle, hits really hard, and has more hitpoints than the normal ones.  His common drop is a single use DD item (I can't remember the name at the moment :( ) and his rare are the Black Chitin Leggings.<br><br>Efreeti Lord Djarn<br>Past all the imp protectors and lava guardians is the spawning place of one of the prizes of Sol B.  Efreeti Lord Djarn is a level 50 caster who also hits very hard and has a ton of hps.  If you aren't prepared he will whipe the floor with you (although if you made it past the imps and elementals, you can probably handle him) His common drop is Djarn's Amathyst Ring, and his rare are the prized Golden Efreeti Boots<br><br>The Noxious Spider<br>On the way to Nagenfen is the spider room.  In this area the Noxious spider spawns.  Nox (his pet name) has a mean poison, hits very hard, and has alot of hitpoints. His Rare drop is the Gold Chitin Bracer, and his common is the Green Silken Drape<br><br>The Stone Spider<br>In the same area as Nox, spawns the stone spider.  The stone spider has a similar abilities to Nox, but can stun as well.  He dropps the Brown Chitin Protector.<br><br>Warlord Skarlon<br>This is one of the first Named Giants you will see when killing off the fire giants.  He hits hard, and has a ton of hps.  He drops the Razing Sword of Skarlon as his ultra rare drop, the Mithril Arms, and Mithril Legs as his more common drops.  <br><br>King Tranix<br>He is very similar to Warlord Skarlon, he hits hard and has a ton of hps.  His rare drop is the Crown of King Tranix and his common is the Polished Mithril Torque<br><br>Magi Rokyl<br>The toughest of the named giants is as mean as the other two, but also a powerful caster.  His rare drop is Rokyl's Channeling Crystal and his common is the Polished Mithril Mask<br><br>Lord Nagenfen<br>well I will leave this one up to you.. I could go on for days about the strategy behind this guy.  Every guy I have seen kill him has done it differently.  You need to be smart and talented to take this guy on ;)<br>He has too many great drops to name ;)<br><br>I think that about covers it all, but if I have missed anything or am wrong please correct me ;)<br>&nbsp;<br>Gurglespit Froggybasher<br>Level 54 Troll Champion<br>Retired<br>Erolissi Marr</td></tr>
