He wants you to bring him the Pestilence Scythe and heart found on Lord Grimrot in SK.  Lord Grimrot spawns in two versions- a weak skeletal form (level 30 or so) that drops the heart, and a stronger human form (level 35 or so) with the scythe.  The strong form is a very rare spawn  (I have been told that he may be a triggered spawn, but I don't know how to trigger him).  Both have harm touch and all the other appropriate SK abilities.  The big version is very magic resistant, can solo a cyclops quite easily, and has no problems making mincemeat out of anything less than a full 35'ish group.   If you bring him back the scythe and the heart, he may reward you with the Aegis of Life, a very nice shield.  Here is the catch.  You need to have a very high amount of faction to complete this quest.  High end warmly is required. If you really want this item, I would suggest you kill putrid skeletons until you get no more faction hits, then do one of the lower end quests at least several hundred times to raise your faction (the bone chips, bandit sashes and donations quests all raise this faction), and then cross your fingers and hope it is enough, since there is no way to know if your faction is good enough until you actually give him the items.  (You can check faction by giving the scythe and seeing if you get more than a thank you, since the scythe is a little easier to get than the heart).  The faction you need is not as high as it used to be, but you still want to be careful with it.</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I was in SK killing bandits for faction, when someone shouted that the live grimrot was up. I quickly sent the guy a message, as he said that he was going to kill him, and he agreed to let me loot. Unfortunatley, by the time i had got there, the corpse had rotted, and it got zilch.  I then sat down immediatley to pick up camp, and about 2 hours later the ph spawed. he was a standing putrid skelleton standing under the little plat with nothing on top of it. I promptly killed him as soon as he spawned, and about 3 hours and 20 minutes later, the undead version of grim spawned. I buffed myself up with everything i had, and killed him and his pet.  His pet died with one nuke, and i then rooted grim, he died with about 3 shots of banish undead.  it took all of about 23 seconds to kill the both of em.  I was really excited, because he dropped both the scythe and the heart, and then i read the boards here, and found out it was wrong scythe...i proceeded to cry..heheh. I am hoping to get lucky with the live version as well, but i won't hold my breathe. btw, im a 49 cleric, so i will prob have to get lots of help to kill the live version if what i hear about him being magic resistant is true<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello everyone,<br>This is a very ardous quest as I'm sure you have figured out so far.  I wanted to say a few things about my trials during this quest.  As far as killing him at different times of the day to get the different spawn types...&lt;shrug&gt; I did the 5&5 and the 7&7 and it never ensured that what I wanted would pop.  But since everyone that dosnt' agree with this method says just kill it whenever, why not.  As far as all that goes, Do yourself a favor and bind right in front of where he spawns.  Every time you get a chance log in and check to see if he's there.  If you get the PH, you know when you kill him he's gonna be back in 3-3.5 hours.  Just be persistant.  You will get him eventually.  In between spawns a good way to kill time is to hunt the RAIDERS that spawn east of the stone bridge along the water, about halfway to the treants.  They are not bandits but do drop sashes that you can turn in to the pally guy in Qeynos and get faction for this quest.  Second, about having enough faction to complete it.  If you talk to Camlend Serbold and say "Lord Grimrot" this will start his speech about the quest.  If he asks you if you are ready to "defend life"  then you DO have enough faction with him to turn in the components.  This happens when you have WARMLY faction with him.  Hope this helps at least someone out there.  <br><br>Zedeki, Cleric of Marr<br>Lanys T'Vyl<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>First, let me say that I do not claim to be an authority on this quest.  I have completed it once and will share my experience in case it may help others.  <br>This quest took me about 40 hours to camp give or take an hour.  I decided to follow the 5 am / 5 pm recommendation.  The first night I killed the place holder at 5 am 3 times.  I never got Grim to spawn.  The next morning when I woke up, I loged on just to check and see if he was up and the undead version of Grim was up.  I can't guarantee it was because of the time I killed it as there may have been others that came during the 8 hours I wasn't online but it is possible I guess.  I have two accounts (no I don't have a life) so I had my level 50 cleric and level 51 warrior camped there. I loaded my warrior and easily killed the undead Grim.  My cleric didn't even have to heal my warrior and my warrior had no buffs on at all.  <br>I then spent several long days camping Grim.  I was killing at 5 pm at that point.  I was about to log to go to dinner and was waiting on my last spawn since I was timing it.  Much to my surprise (after about 40 hours total) the live version spawned.  I loaded my warrior and had my cleric there for heals.  I had a friend who was there playing his 45 wizard and we engaged Grim.  He was MUCH tougher to kill.  I had to heal my warrior several times with Celestial Heal and my wizard friend nuked several times but was almost resisted every time.  I could be wrong but I think the only spell he landed was a fire based one.  If anyone is interested, leave a post and I will double check and respond later.  <br>When the live Grim spawns, he is in pally armor (which kind of surprised me).  The place holder is the standing putrid skeleton under the little ruin.  I don't believe that killing any of the other skeletons in the area helps to force the spawn.  I turned in about 30 bandit sashes, 700 gold pieces (2 at a time), and killed probably 100 or so putrid skeletons.  Killing the putrid skeletons gives you the faction you need for the quest so I recommend killing them the entire time you are there to work on your faction while you work on this quest.  I have also heard that you can turn in bone chips to Lance Nova.....(whatever his name is) instead of gold pieces.  I don't know that this is correct but it might be worth a shot.  You turn them in two at a time just like the gold pieces.  If this works, just loot all of the skellies that you kill and you can turn their bone chips in for faction too.  <br>Like someone mentioned before, there is a pestilence scythe that drops off of both the live and dead versions that is not the one you need for the quest.  Each of the items have to be no drop for the quest.  Also as mentioned before, if you go to the guy in the temple and say "I come to defend (protect, can't remember the exact wording) life" and he tells you about Grim, then you are high enough faction to turn in the items for the Aegis.  <br>I realize that this isn't a lot of new information, but I just wanted to say that at least the 5 pm thing worked for me and that there is a possibility that the 5 am worked too.  Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to spawn time so I really can't say if they spawn at midnight or noon.  I hope this helps someone out with the quest though as this is a really good item.  If you have any questions please feel free to post them and I will answer them if I can.<br><br>Shalon Shadowwolf, 52 Druid<br>Keggar Dabrewmeister, 51 Warrior<br>Ruumm Forrezz, 50 Cleric<br>Mithaniel Marr Server<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I started this quest today, killed the ph at 5am game time and then after the three hours another ph spawned.  It was at 10pm game time.  I considered waiting because of the rumor about the 5am thing, but I thought what the heck and killed him.  After another three hours I logged in and the live version had spawned.  Someone had killed him before I got to him, but only because he attacked them.  They let me have the scythe which was fortunate :)<br><br>I raised my faction with the bone chips.  Give Lashun Novashine four at a time and you get two faction hits.  When I ran out of bones, and was at warmly, it took me about 30pp to get enough faction for them to tell me about the quest.  It took a LOT of bone chips from apprehensive, many backpacks full.  I lost count after a while.<br><br>I think it really is just random, not sure there is anything to this 5am/5pm thing because like I said, he spawned after I killed the ph at 10pm.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I got aegis of life in 2 real life days..This is how its done but this is gonna be brief for I dont have much time.<br><br>Undead version:<br>Go to skele camp in Sk. Look for a putrid skeleton that is already standing up. Note that all but one putrid skeleton is standing up. The only standing putrid is the Place holder of either version. If you see the standing putrid wait to kill him till 5am ish eq time. Now the next spawn will be either the undead grim or another standing putrid. If its the grim then grats! If its another ph dont kill until 5am ish again. The spawn time for either the ph or grim is 3 hours 15 minutes on average, varies from 3 hours to 3 hours 30 mins. So log out of the game and set a timer if you like thats what I did =)<br><br>Live version:<br>Same thing as above, same spawn times except you gotta kill the ph around 5pm eq time. Now for the live version, you will get lots of phs, if you get a ph wait to kill him around 5pm again-This is important people. I got 4 phs for the live grim rot, And I only got 1 ph for the undead version.<br><br>I got aegis in 2 real life days but I was not on line much. I timed all the spawns and logged off and logged back on a little early before the ph/grim spawn.<br><br>Not sure if you HAVE to kill the phs at 5 am or 5pm but that is what I did. If you do not kill them 5am ish or 5pm ish at least be consistent with your kill times of the phs! Grim is a random spawn but can be helped out by killing his phs at consistent times! There is no despawn people. And there is no 12am 12pm crap!<br><br>Faction:<br>I did soulire and my faction is already pretty good. I did do the fish quest for about an hour near the temple of life. I then turned in my no drop stuff and presto I got it!!!<br><br>Good luck<br>51 cavalier<br>Bristlebane<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Just got this one so here are some hints:<br><br>It's a looooong camp.  The spawn varies from 3:10 - 3:35 with lots of PH's.  If the spawn is in the day you have a *chance* at the live Grimrot, if at night you have a *chance* for the undead Grimrot.  The best time to kill the PH is 5:00 am or 5:00 pm (EQ Time).  Don't believe the boards that say he has to spawn at 12:00 noon/midnight to get the real grimrot, that is not so.<br><br>As for faction, the single best way is to collect bandit sashes.  This will give you something to do between spawns.  There is a nice bandit camp due east of the grimrot spawn in SK and has about 10 spawn possitions.  Buy a lot of backpacks and go to town on these guys.  It's great faction AND great money, I turned in 30 bandit sashes and made over 100pp (after selling the bronze weapons).  Here's another fact I didn't learn until I did it -- you get XP for the sashes!  And good xp too.  At level 51 I received a full blue bub for 30 sashes.  That's the quivelent of 2 hours in an xp group (yes 51+ xp sucks).<br><br>Good luck with the camp, the best advice I have for you is to make it an around the clock camp (you can log out or sleep between PH's).  That way you always know when it'll spawn and you can be there ready to kill it.  To give you some idea of wait time, I killed him every 3 (or so) hours for 3 days straight (yes during the night as well).  So for me it was a VERY long camp.  Others have had better luck with the spawn, but it is random, there is no formula other than the Day/Night spawn.<br><br>-Fuz<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>This morning, I got the Aegis, at long last.  I have never felt such a sense of accomplishment.  In total, I have spent upwards of 25 hours on this quest between the necessary faction work and the actual pursuit (well, camping LOL) of the pestilent Lord Grimrot in both his forms.<br><br>I can confirm that at least as of when I got my Decaying Heart a month ago, the system of killing the PH around 5AM worked like a charm.  Although I had to kill 7 PHs, he spawned exactly when he was supposed to.<br><br>But there may be some changes afoot in this quest yet again.  This morning, when a bard in my guild announced that he had Lord Grimrot on tracking and it was the live (Paladin) version (which promptly caused me to freak out and scurry like a rodent to get to South Karana as fast as possible for a svelte Erudite cleric), it was nighttime in game - about 9PM.  At first I just assumed that Lord Grimrot had been sitting there unmolested until the bard engaged him to keep anyone else from killing him.  <br><br>But then we ran into a cleric who had also been waiting around in SK for the dead version of Grimrot, and he asked me why live Grim had spawned at night, a question for which I have no answer.  He insists that this version had spawned at night, not in the daytime.  He also said that he'd heard of one case recently where even though the quester's faction was high enough with Priests of Life to get the quest from Camrend Seybold, turning in the items did not result in the shield.  You can imagine my terrorof a similar fate, which lasted from that moment forward until I saw the message giving me experience and delivering my shield (at which point I nearly swooned).<br><br>So if what the other cleric said was true, Verant may have introduced some new random factors in the Grimrot spawn and the quest, where you can't be guaranteed of getting the live Grimrot just in the daytime or of getting the shield even with high-end warmly faction.   On the other hand, I'm hoping he was just a highly disappointed cleric since he too was working on his Aegis and had more waiting ahead of him.<br><br>Anyhow, good luck to all.  This thing ROCKS  (even though I'm glad I never have to kill another bandit for a sash as long as I live ROFL).  This is the best feeling I have EVER had in EQ - even better than making level 50.<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I finally finished killing the two Grimrots this morning after spending 50 or 60 hours camping him on and off for a month (largest stretch was 15+ hours). The following is my opinion on the whole spawn thing.<br><br>There is only one spawn and one PH (always carries a rusty bastard sword and is the only standing putrid) in a fixed spawn place. I've read elsewhere that he can spawn in any of the putrid places, but this is not true. When Grimrot does spawn, the time of day decides if you get the live or undead version. The live always spawns during the day, and the undead during the night -- never the other way around. As I have seen observed elsewhere, the time that is considered "night" is shorter then the "day", so the live version seems to be more common.<br><br>I have killed the PH at 5am, 5pm, 12am, 12pm, at random times, and watched others kill it at 1am, 3am, 1pm, and 3pm -- all of which resulted in a PH excepting 3 spawns. I don't think there is anything special about these times except that the death of the PH determines the time of the next spawn. The spawn time seems (as observed on another board) to be 3 game days minus roughly 7 hours. So killing the PH at 5am will result in a 10pm spawn (meaning undead version, if he spawns), give or take a couple of game hours. <br><br>The PH that spawned the live Grimrot for me was killed at 12pm and resulted in a 7am spawn. The PH that spawned the undead Grimrot was killed at 5am and resulted in a 11pm spawn.<br><br>Also, I'm told that the quest can be shared, but that all parties much have the same super-high warmly faction. I do not know for a fact that it can be shared, but this is what I'm told.<br><br>I don't think killing the other putrids has any effect on the spawn whatsoever. But if you kill time by killing putrids then beware the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos. There is a nasty level 50 SK Corrupt Guard that hangs around the PoD in NQ sometimes. He has harm touch is killed me (level 50 cleric) with one melee hit (300+- as I recall) and harm touch.<br><br>As for the spawns themselves, the undead version seemed to have about 1k hp. Banish Undead and Sound of Force took him down 3/4. The second Banish Undead killed him.<br><br>The live version is much tougher. He must have close to, but not quite, 2k hp. He seems very resistant to cleric nukes, other classes have less trouble casting on him. I killed, or help kill, him twice. I found that my nukes were next to useless against him but that it was possible to melee him down, saving mana for self-heals. Pumice (sp) stones (purchasable) are useful for debuffing him -- he seems to like to cast some sort of steal strength or similar spell.<br><br>Building faction with the Priests of Life is pretty easy, but almost as boring as the camp. Find Novashine in North Qeynos (either at the temple or wandering around outside) and give him either 2gp or (and this is quicker) 4 stacks of 2 bone chips. Keep doing this until the you can receive the quest from Camlend Serbold.<br><br>Good luck...<br><br>O<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hello and thanks to all who have posted information here regarding this difficult, if not arduous, quest.  Without the information posted here, this quest would have been almost impossible, and i still haven't figured out how anyone unraveled the mysteries of the VERY specific timing.  Anyway, i feel obligated to share with you all my Grimrot experience, which thankfully was quick and easy :)<br><br>First thing to note, is that I heard that to get the version of Lord Grimrot you want (i.e. the live or the undead version) you need to kill the place holder at a specific hour of the day.  For the undead version, kill the STANDING putrid skellie PH at 5AM (eq time).  To get the live version to spawn, kill the ph at5pm (eq time).  <br><br>The way that I did this was to camp at the spawn site, and log on once in a awhilke throughout the day until the PH was up.  I then protected him as best I could until the appropriate eq time for the kill.  The biggest dangers to killing him early are other players wandering too close and aggroing him.  I then buffed myself to max (I am a 44 cleric) and medded to full and camped.<br><br>3.5 real time hours after the PH went down I made sure i was back on line, and BOTH times the approprite Grimrot spawn popped!!  That part may have been a tad lucky, hehe.<br><br>The undead version is a total, utter puss for a 44 cleric, he went down like a sack of potatoes.  For the live version, who is around level 37-38 and has about 1700 hp's, I did a quick search in the zone and found a 50 ranger who was willing to help me:  Most folks are definitely willing to help:)  The live version was tougher, I only nuked him twice (I had a 50 ranger helping me, remember :).  One time the nuke was partially resisted and the 2nd time it went through full.  I am confident that I could have taken Lord on my own, assuming the resistance was not full.<br><br>Anyway, loot the pestilence scythe (no drop version) from the live grim and the heart from the dead grim.<br><br>I hope this clears some things up :)  Don't just randomly kill the place holder or you are in for a LONG LONG camp.<br><br>good luck, and may Brell smile upon you :)<br><br>Anders Sacrifizen (level 44 cleric) The Tribunal<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have some interesting information about Multiquesting for this.<br><br>I have had the scythe for some time while a friend had the heart on a pali he doesnt play much. He offered to try and multi it with me. I felt that camping grim for 40+ hours without a dead spawn was about my limit so I agreed. If it didnt work, I would return in a month or two to try it again.<br><br>Something wierd happened though:<br><br>-He didnt have enough faction to do the quest.<br>-I had enough faction.<br>-We were grouped.<br>-When he handed in his heart, he received the aegis.<br><br>YES, let me say again that he did not have faction and only handed in heart and received his Aegis. We didnt realize and I handed in scythe also, after which he said "WTF, I got the aegis".<br><br>I saw his message before I handed in my peice so there was no error in which was first. He got his aegis without faction and handing in only the heart.<br><br>I then got extremely lucky last night and woke up at 4am to find a dead grim standing there. I handed in the heart and received my aegis. But, that doesnt prove a bug because the scythe I handed in 10 hours earlier might completed my quest.<br><br>One of two things happened here. Either someone handed Carmend a scythe before we got there (which was what we first figured on). Or, the quest is bugged in some way. I for one cant think of any reason why someone would hand a scythe in alone. If you knew enough to hand it to him, you would know that a heart is also needed.<br><br>I feel that the probability that the quest is bugged is greater than the one that someone handed in a scythe before us.<br><br>If anyone out there has a heart only *AND* is willing to take a chance I would like to hear how handing in the heart only worked out for you.<br><br>If anyone else out there multis I would also like to hear what happened. Let me know which persons involved had enough faction too please.<br><br>If you would like to ask me questions regarding this, send me a tell in Xegony as Aurelius.<br><br>If it is a bug, I am sure alot of people without the scythe will be very happy. Would be interesting to see if grouping with someone that has faction does anything also.<br><br>Thanks and I am sure people will be reluctant to try this. I am really asking those people who have kind of given up on the quest but have the heart. Maybe have a friend with live peice standing by in case the heart does nothing.<br><br>I hope some try this and post something.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Aurelius <br>Circle of Vengeance<br>&nbsp;<br> </td></tr>
