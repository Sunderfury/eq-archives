	   <tr><td colspan=2>I have been very busy with work and such for awhile now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, I haven't been posting much.  As Verant still has not properly completed my transfer request for Judd Jaggedoak, my 33rd level ranger (who should be level 40 by now); I have been playing my Dwarven Paladin, Ironhom Hammerforge.<br><br>Ironhom's recent adventures have taken him from the basement of Unrest, the Dawnshroud Peaks and Netherbian Lair of Luclin, the Tower of Frozen Shadow in Iceclad, and most recently, the Stonebrundt Mountains of Odus.  In the Stonebrundt, I have been attempting the Swiftclaw Sash Quest, which is extrememly difficult when you do not have track.  So far I have killed only one Heretic Invader and many tigers, leopards, gorillas and pandas.  Animal rights activists will be very upset.<br><br>As far as PVP, I haven't seen too much action.  Awhile back I did kill two Tildes (a newer xteaming PK guild that has appeared on Tallon Zek) that attacked me while I waited for the portal to Luclin in North Karana.  It was extremely satisfying to take out two people who tried to attack you, especially when they are &quot;lights&quot; doing the nasty deed of attacking other lights.  I must give them credit for following the unwritten rules of PVP by &quot;scooting&quot; after they had been defeated.  I am applying to join the guild Chivalric Order, where many of my friends are members.<br><br>I'll see you all soon.  Well met and safe questing.<br><br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Dwarven Paladin<br>Tallon Zek Server<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Usula inspected the rapid construction going taking place in the shipyards of Warsliks Woods and was sufficiently impressed with the progress that was being made.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wished that Pusbag had concentrated his efforts on Ak'Anon, because as it was, the one Gnome slave she currently had was hindering production.  Nevertheless, she could be patient, as this particular little gnome was quite clever, and many of his innovations had pleased the military hierarchy of Cabilis.<br><br>The new Iksar navy was something to behold, and the monks from among the Iksar proved extremely adept sailors.  Soon, very soon, Cabilis would have a naval force powerful enough to challenge the current Elven supremacy of the seas.  Work was indeed progressing better than she had anticipated, and with that thought she smiled.  It was time for her to return to Cabilis and spare some attention for the former Troll King.  She had delicious things in mind for him today.<br><br>~~~<br><br>When she entered the chamber, Pusbag was a collapsed mass of blood.  The ever-tireless Embalmer had skillfully removed his skin several times in the past week, but Usula was getting bored with the regular routine of torture.  Secretly, she suspected that Pusbag was beginning to take a perverse pleasure in the torture.  Now, however, she dismissed the Embalmer with a wave of her hand.  He gathered up the flayed skins and left the chamber.<br><br>Usula cast a spell, and Pusbag began to heal.  Once he was conscious and no longer bleeding profusely, he eyed Usula with a wicked grin.<br><br>&quot;I grow tired of you, troll, but do not think for a moment your torment is over.  No, indeed.  Today we travel to Kaladim, where I will make a gift of you to the Dwarves.  It shall be their turn to wreak revenge upon you.  The Lunarsa will be here shortly, and she shall conduct you to Kaladim.  I do not think I would be particularly well received there, after my reputation had grown by my young hunting of the Dwarven guards.  They have long memories, do the Dwarves.&quot;<br><br>A moment later, Pusbag saw the same High Elven Wizardess appear in the room, look at him with nothing more than detached interest, and then consult briefly with Usula in Usula's own tongue.<br><br>&quot;Come with me&quot; the lady said.  She spoke Troll as if a native of Grobb.  Before he could even prepare himself, he was standing before shocked guards at the entrance to Kaladim.  The Wizardess was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Usula Wurmbane<br>Iksar Necromancer<br>Empress of Fear</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Captain Aluvidiel peered throught the Gnomish spyglass.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no mistake.  The ship attempting to pursue them was manned by Iksar.  It was a bulky construction, but seaworthy.  From this distance, Aluvidiel estimated the ship to be about sixty feet in length and twenty five feet in width.  The bow and stern were well crafted timber, probably form Warslik's Woods, with bronze armored plating.  A large fifteen foot iron ram was mounted to the front of the ship.  It was mounted low in the water, which would increase it's effectiveness.<br><br>The Iksar vessel had two main masts.  From these the Iksar had arrayed a variety of cloth sails.  While Captain Aluvidiel wasn't sure about the layout of the sails, he could not ignore the fact that the Iksar vessel achieved a respectable speed.  This despite it's bulk and armor, in addition to the peculiar sail array.<br><br>Aluvidiel completed notes in his journal, then signaled to his first mate to open the Sails of Tunare.  The wind was strong today in Timorous Deep.  It blew in a northwesterly direction off the coast of Kunark.  Like a butterfly emerging from it's cocoon, the membranic sails unfurled from the sides of the Elven clipper.  Instantly the strong winds filled the sails,  and the Elven craft lept forward through the waves.  Within minutes the Iksar vessel dissapeared over the horizon, left far behind.<br><br>Aluvidiel moved to the front of the ship.  He pondered what King Thex would make of the return of the Iksar to the seas of Norrath. <br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc<br><br>Zykon got me again last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he was teamed with another Erudite wizard named Evocon in Mistmoore. They were pking.  I had enough trouble already with morons pulling constant trains from the jail.  All I had to do was sit near the zone line and kill mobs as they trained in.  At one time there were two full groups plus about 5 or 6 solo characters like me all fighting one massive castle train.  It was true chaos, nearly 20 characters and about 30 mobs, everybody hitting everything.  <br><br>Well, I got in a few kills.  I was sitting and medding at the end of the ramp when I saw &quot;Zykon begins to cast a spell&quot;.  Uh oh. The two of them took me down fast, but, I got some shots in this time.  Zykon is an honorable pker and I don't have a problem with him.  I asked him how many times he had died since he deleveled to 35.  He informed me that he had died only once out of approximately 100 battles.  Deleveling works.  I'm never going to do it though.  I'm not on this server for just pvp.  I'm on this server for the challenge and the excellent roleplaying opportunities it provides.<br><br>Didn't get much done so I logged off after about two hours.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>No activity yet on Jaggedoak.&nbsp;&nbsp;No email.  No nothing.  I will resubmit my request.  I hope I don't get charged twice for one transfer.  He is still sitting naked in Kelethin on Torvonillous.<br><br>Ironhom had an excellent day on Tallon Zek.  I hunted in Unrest with a 36 Monk.  He was pulling the mobs to the path near the fountain where we would waste them.  In three hours of hunting I only had to use LOH once.  Made about 2 yellows of exp at hell (30) and made one run to the Dwarf on the island in Dagnor's to sell when I was encumbered.  <br><br>A Wood Elf Druid named Ghnibby who was in a dark guild (can you say X-teamer) did attack us while we were engaged with a festering hag and the ghost of the undead noble (drops bloodstained mantle).  This jerk snared both of us and started nuking while were fighting at half health.  GMs and Guides will no longer intercede when this type of play takes place so we had to fight it out.  I don't like it, but it is legal to exp kill and corpse camp/bind camp now.  We had to finish the fight before looking for Ghnibby so we did that.  I was snared and moving quite slowly.<br><br>I did manage to root him once, but then I was oom and at half health.  My LOH was down.  He eventually killed the 36 monk I was with.  I looted the bloodstained mantle so no one else got and put it on.  He started to nuke me, but was doing less damage.  I ran to the zone line to med.  Ghnibby found me and hid (Wood Elf), then started nuking me again.  I zoned.  He zoned.  I zoned again.  He did not follow.  When my partner returned we continued to fight undead.  <br><br>About an hour later, while the monk was inside pulling, Ghnibby attacked again.  This time I was at full health/full mana and my LOH was up.  I was wearing the bloodstained mantle (I won the roll when the monk returned) and carrying a MM shield and wearing Dwarven Ringmail Tunic.  My MR was 58.  This time I resisted every single spell he cast on me (which was a snare and about 8 or 9 nukes).  When he obviously went oom, instead of fighting, he ran and did not return.  Since he attacked while we were engaged with mobs and is an obvious xteamer, I have this to say:<br><br>&quot;Ghnibby, you are noted and all who know me now know you.  You are a slick, yet cowardly piece of crap and we will keep an eye out for you.  Have a nice day.&quot;<br><br>Eventually I split loot with the monk and bid him farewell.  I was overloaded with fine steel weaps and gems when I left plus a ton of grave molds. I also looted a thick leather apron and several pieces of bronze and ringmail armor.  Between the time I hunted before the monk and afterwards, I made over 200 plats on this haul.<br><br>I purchased a Dusty Breastplate (AC22 20 hps +10 sta) when I returned to Kelethin and sold my tattered mantle (shoulder AC12 +20 hps +10 vs dis) for 100pp to complete the purchase for the Dusty Breastplate.  I was left with 90 pp (broke again - but I can make money now) and forged some skewers and pie tins so Jagmo can make Gnomish Telescopes or something like that.  Bought ales and was drunk while I smithed.<br><br>I sold most of the stuff in my locker (thats what I call bank from LOK days) so I am ready to start filling it with some serious loot.  Hail Lashara!  You can have my old Dwarven Ringmail Tunic.  The MR on it is important for PVP and I need the AC the Dusty Breastplate provides.  The Bloodsatined Mantle will make up the MR difference for me.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc<br><br>Ironhom dinged 30 last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened while raiding Mistmoore.  It is the second character I have reached level 30 with.  It felt good.  I had all my spells on me and memmed them right there.  Unfortunately the group disbanded at that time.  <br><br>I decided to leave MM and head to Gfay to meet a new young High Cleric named Truet.  I am sure you will be hearing about him soon.  Just read Tochail's journal.  I twinked him up a little because PVP can be rough.  This is known because I was killed by an Erudite Wizard in Lfay as I proceeded to Gfay from MM.  His name is Zyklon if I remember correctly.  Later on I saw about 50 of his corpses in front of Felwithe.  I sent him a tell asking him how many levels he had deleveled himself.  He said he went from 43 all the way down to 35!  Thats 8 levels for you math majors.  Since you only retain 5 levels of skills when you delevel, he lost 3 levels of skill.   But, being level 35 he could attack a level 27 player with the magic skill level of a level 40 wizard.  Tricks of the trade on PVP.  Needless to say I resisted nothing he cast at my level 30 (MR was 48) and he rooted me and killed me with bolts from  a great distance.  I died fast.  Kudos to him.  Good kill.  It's not easy for wizards, but he was hardcore to delevel all they to 35 from 43.<br><br>I hooked Truet up with some stuff.  Said hello to Mireena who was on again.  I gave her some stuff to get started the other night.  I hope they both have fun.  They are on the same team and I know they were ridding the Faydark of Cents together later in the evening.<br><br>I also went to Luclin last night.  It was my first trip there with one of my main characters.  Strange place, strange noises.  I spent 2 hours wandering around learning they lay out of the place.  I found the paladin/cleric trainers and purchased my Luclin Paladin Spells.  I can't wait to use Instrument of Nife.<br><br>I am sorry that I did not say good night to Truet and Mireena, but, I booted and was tired and never logged back on.<br><br>So, goodnight friends!  Good luck on Tallon Zek.  I hope you enjoy it.  You know I will be around and I am not too far ahead of you in level, so soon we may group together.  I don't level very fast and I'm going through a hell level now.  I cant wait to read about your first PVP.<br><br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Dwarven Paladin<br>Tallon Zek Server<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc on<br><br>Wow, as usual, a lot happening over in the storyline.&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for the story of &quot;Illusion Queynos&quot; was given to me by Jagmo (Tallon Zek Server) who used to be Gnomoh Gnoless.  He had to remake that character because for an enchanter his base charisma wasn't high enough for PVP.  Gnomoh now lives only in these stories.<br><br>When I read Usula's story about the Heretics I began to wonder if the forces of Light would ever have any victory other than killing a few Iksar in Kaladim and a Troll or two in the Butcherblock.  So I got rid of the Hole.  Icewind should be happy.<br><br>As for my characters, Gnomoh is going to stick around Odus for awhile.  Zanaq and Ironhom are in Faydwer.  I have a seperate storyline I would like to write there, but, alas, it seems the Tier'Dal are asking for help.  I hope you guys write about that one for a little while.  I want to write about Ironhom's youth a little bit.  <br><br>Then there is the matter of Jaggedoak.  Well, he's dead.  I'll write about him again at the appropiate time (that being when Verant get's their butt in gear on my transfer request).  I don't envision him jumping into the fray anytime soon, although.<br><br>I am not being at all concieted, but, I think as an offshoot it would be interesting to write about what happens on the Elvish voyage to bring the Barbarians to a new homeland.  I have only vague ideas at the moment, but it could be something entirely seperate to write about.  Please feel free to take off with it.  Maybe somebody new will join our little storytelling group and get that one started.  I'm not going to touch it for awhile.<br><br>And regarding my earlier post about Brotherhood of the Wolf.  I think the &quot;beast&quot; is a lion.  The size was appropiate, and that wicked bastard said he was maimed by a lion and taunted the Iriquois about his being half lion.  It was also said at the end that he brought back &quot;cubs&quot; from Africa and kept only the strongest one.  I think it is a lion.<br><br>Still, I am doing a lot of PVP on Tallon Zek.  Tochail, if you read this today, I will be on tonight and headed back to Faydwer.  I have to grab some stuff from Neriak for you along the way, but I can set you up pretty well.  Throw in some plats also.  We have some low level characters on Faydwer that can hunt with you occasionally.  We are working on getting into a really good guild, and will invite you when the time is right.<br><br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Dwarven Paladin<br>Tallon Zek Server <br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The following letter Gnomoh would discover in his robe pocket, shortly after the fall of Qeynos.<br><br>&quot;Gnomoh:<br><br>&quot;Firstly, allow me to intorduce myself to you. This letter is scribed by the hand of one Mistress Chaesendra D'Morte, Ambassador of Neriak and leader of the Order of the Raven.<br><br>&quot;I am deeply shocked and disturbed to discover that you feel we murder your high elven associates in cold blood. That is simply not the case, and while it has occured to me that the Lights had no method of communicating with myself, I am insulted you would jump to such a conclusion.<br><br>&quot;The Netekulous Forest is plauged with a considerable amount of vermin, as you might well know from your own Steamfont. Wolves, spiders and undead roam just outside our city, and since we do not opt to live up in the trees, we must enlist other means of preventing our city from being overrun by these pests. The means implied are of course, the stone guardians you may have heard tell of. Unfortunately, they cannot discern a pasty elf from a skeleton (they do have quite poor vision) and it was such that resulted in the erradication of the elven heralds. Please accept my apologies on the matter and note that the guardians have been reprimanded.<br><br>&quot;The Order of the Raven has its eyes everywhere, Gnomoh. There is not a day that goes by that I am not informed with every step you take. However, it is not you who are vexing me currently. This &quot;Pusbag Infection&quot; has taken hold of Antonica, as you are likely well aware. Only our city of drow remains on the continent (save for the Ogres, of course, who are far too stupid to stand clear of harm's way). We have no doubts that Pusbag's next move will be to claim our home in Neriak.<br><br>&quot;We would offer our assistance in helping the armies of Light reclaim Antonica and destroy the Infection. We are poised in the Netekulous and ready to strike with your assistance.<br><br>&quot;As I have noted, the Eyes of the Order of the Raven are ever-watchful. The wild elf Lashara has enlisted the entire populations of Faydwer (being the gnomes, dwarves, cat-people, and the elves of Tunare into a full fledged assault to be launched on the Troll; Ironhom will likely be quickly assembled in to those ranks as soon as he returns to the Faydwer. Lashara has also been sent a similar copy of this letter, and her reaction, while not yet noted, is expected shortly.<br><br>&quot;All that remains is support from the West of Antonica. I would ask your assistance in the matter, and note that it may be imperitive for you to be ready, whatever your stance on our plight may be. Our efforts in the East may flush the Trolls West, in which case you do not want to be caught unawaress.<br><br>&quot;It will not be necessary to forge a reply to this letter, Gnomoh, and doing so may not prove wise. Once you have decided, simply state your decision aloud in some private corner of your chambers. The Order of the Raven sees all, hears all, knows all. I will receive your comment, and via some means, make reply to you.<br><br>&quot;Cordially,<br>Mistress Chaesendra D'Morte<br>Leader of the Order of the Raven<br>Ambassador of Neriak<br>Daughter of Innoruuk<br>Childe of Hate&quot;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>"Little Miss Bow & Arrows"<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 35th sun <br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc<br><br>After seeing Lord of the Rings 3 times since it came out I decided it was time to see another movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw Fellowship of the Ring alone the last two times since my girlfriend does not like fantasy or science fiction and doesn't like computers.  So you can imagine how she feels about EQ, but, I rant - back to the subject.<br><br>My girlfriend is French, so I said to her, &quot;Let's go see Brotherhood of the Wolf.  It is in French with English subtitles.&quot;  Of course, she was overjoyed.  She says she is not nationalistic at all and she does not like my fanatical American Patiotism, but, she lept at the chance to see a French movie. <br><br>Now she didn't have any idea what the movie was about.  I did.  She also despises horror movies.  I didn't say anything.  I figured, she does like period movies, and this takes place a little while before the French Revolution.  Maybe that will help.<br><br>Well, right away at the beginning a woman is gruesomely slain by the &quot;beast&quot; in the movie.  It is actually a pretty violent scene.  I was totally geared up.  I looked over and saw my girlfriend peeking out from behind her hand, but she wasn't upset, she was entranced.  You see, Brotherhood of the Wolf is that kind of movie.  The cinematography is rich and colorful.  There is a lot of action.  There is romance.  There is mystery.  Everything about the movie is well done.  Some of the scenes were frightening, as evidenced by the screams in the theater.  It was a great movie.  It is 2 hours long, so pee before you go in.  You won't want to leave once it starts.<br><br>I always remember to pee before I watch a movie now.  Ever since I saw Titanic and didn't pee before it started.  By the middle of the movie before the &quot;iceberg&quot; I really had to go.  Of course, from that point on the whole movie was running water, bursting water, ships sinking and water, people sinking in water, water in water and more water.  I thought I would explode.  I could barely walk out of the movie theater by the end.  I still have dreams about that.<br><br>I digress once again, but, this is a &quot;journal&quot; after all.  Go see Brotherhood of the Wolf.  Great movie.  Also, I am convinced what the &quot;beast&quot; in the movie is.  My girlfriend agrees, but, once of my friends does not.  Post what you think here.  I will post what I think later.  I think it's pretty obvious. <br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Brotherhood of the Wolf was a great movie, I agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;I went there with some japanese friends of mine (heh, 'bout time <b>they</b> were the ones having to read the subtitles with me) and I loved it.  Personally, I haven't figured out what the beast could be, and what I would have suspected given the body shape doesn't make sense when compared to the size of the beast and the statement that it originated in Africa.  What did you think it was?  BTW, my girlfriend HATED this movie... seems the first scene was a bit harsh for her. *shrug*<br><br>ON another topic, I started two new characters over the weekend... the first is Tochail, a High Elven cleric on the Tallon Zek server (so you'll have some company Ironhom) and the second was a Vah Shir Warrior back on the Mith Marr server.  My rl older bro plays a ranger on Mith Marr and came up to give me a minorly better weapon... sad thing is that it's a 2hs weapon... and being a warrior, I don't know if I really want to work on 2hs or whether I should stick with 1hs so that I'm proficient with dual wield.  He also gave me a sacrifical dagger from Mistmoor (heh, so my warrior is slightly more intelligent now) so that I could keep up my piercing skills.  Made it to level 4 that day ~ very interesting to play a warrior, I'll say that much.  (and just as a side note, I was playing on my friend's computer as mine is not yet prepared to handle Luclin).<br><br>The final thing that happened was that I brought Icewind up to Luclin for the first time.  I wanted to go explore Shar Val, and wandered into Shadeweaver Thicket.  Overall an easy zone, until I met the warlord face to face.. everyone around conned dubious, then he attacked.  Being a level 40 cleric (less than 1/2 blue to 41 at that time) and having this guy con even to me (very scary for a cleric, let me tell you) I immediately began to gate out.  The gate was successful, but when I popped back in Felwithe, I was naked with lost experience and unmemmed spells.  Naturally I petitioned.  The guide said it happens quite often and there was nothing he could do.  I told him wasn't a good answer as I had logs showing I gated out and there was no way that the &quot;last hit&quot; could have killed me.  He said I should go to chat and talk to a gm.  So.. I logged off and went to chat, talked to the gm who was too busy aggrandizing herself to bother answering my question until I had asked 4 times (she kept saying things like I'm the mighty gm, or gm gm gm or other similarly idiotic stuff).  Needless to say, I was extremely angry perhaps for the first time in the game because of the game.  Without maps (yes, I know it's stupid to go off exploring new areas without a map especially if you are a cleric, but oh well, life is an adventure anyway) I went back up to Luclin.  A gnome necro noticed I was nekked and asked if he could help.  I said sure, if he could help me overcome a level 40 warrior type and help me recover my corpse.  He said he could summon the corpse but I would have to pay the cost of the coffin (approx 200 plat).  I apologized as I did not have that kind of money (heh, clerics are also notoriously poor) and thanked him for his concern.  He then volunteered to do it for free, saying something along the lines of it being an advertising ploy on his part.  He then guided me through the Palsomething caverns to shadeweavers and promptly summoned my corpse to me.  I ressed myself (a rather irritating thing to do, I must admit) thanked him profusely and promptly contacted his guild leader and commended them (the guild on Mith Marr is Council of Truth).  Overall, a vexing experience with a semi-happy ending.  ~ Verant, I've never had cause to complain about your support until now ~<br><br>My apologies for ranting in your journal Judd.  Hope you look up Tochail (level 2 cleric now) in Tallon sometime, as I'm sure he'll be needing some assistance.  Perhaps a bad choice for a pvp server, but oh well..<br>&nbsp;<br>Icewind Novastorm<br>Koada Dal Cleric of Tunare<br>&lt;&lt;Mith Marr&gt;&gt;</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Hey.<br><br><i>The gate was successful, but when I popped back in Felwithe, I was naked with lost experience and unmemmed spells. Naturally I petitioned. The guide said it happens quite often and there was nothing he could do. I told him wasn't a good answer as I had logs showing I gated out and there was no way that the &quot;last hit&quot; could have killed me. He said I should go to chat and talk to a gm.</i><br>I've been through <b>exactly</b> the same thing with the death after zoning thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was actually asked by the guide to do a <i>/report</i> of the lines where it showed I had successfully zoned, for the GM to see.<br><br>None-the-less, the response was that the GM couldn't prove there was a fault, so I'm on my own!  (I sorta thought he should be proving there <b>wasn't</b> a fault, but obviously I'm insane!)  The GM wasn't even online.  He was apparently talking to the guide through IRC.  When I asked to speak to him, I was told to email.<br><br>I'm sure you will be shocked and horrified to discover I never received a reply.  *Shrug*  Personally, I've gotten to the point, where I don't even bother petitioning.  It's, frankly, not worth the wear and tear on your keyboard...  (The guides are, of course, always charming, but apparently they're not actually authorised to do anything.)<br><br>On the up-side, you should be grateful that you were just short of L41.  You know that hideous awful death penalty that follows <span style='color: red;'><b>Hell</b></span style='color: red;'> levels?  It doesn't scale if you lose a level!  <i>(As in, if you die half way through L41, you lose something like five blue bubbles of EXP.  But, if you die a bubble into L41, you lose that bubble and four in L40!!!  I found this out the hard way.  It didn't make my day.  (And, this was the occaision, with the death after zone!))</i><br><br>Anyhow, you have my sympathy.<br><br>AlAaraaf.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"Te aurdire no possum.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>Ironhom Hammerforge, Dwarven Paladin, stared deeply into the camp fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zanaq had gone to Halas to purchase more ales for the long Everfrost night.  Gnomoh had traveled to Queynos to meet with one of his many mysterious aquaintences, and should return this evening yet.  McAmber and her cronies, Barbarian rogues all, stood across from Ironhom arguing and gesturing wildly.  They were starting to get quite soused.  McAmber motioned to Ironhom for another ale and he grabbed it out of the snow and threw it to her.  She ripped the cork out with her teeth and continued to drink and argue.  Ironhom truly admired Barbarian women.  Too bad they weren't shorter.<br><br>A human wearing a crimson robe approached the camp fire.  The color and fabric of the robe seemed to shift and melt together.  A staff of obvious power was in his hand.  He walked directly to Ironhom and sat down.  The Barbarians hushed and moved a small distance away from the two.  The human was clearly a powerful magic user.<br><br>Ironhom knew better; it was his old friend Gnomoh Gnoless; Gnomish enchanter extrodinairre.  Gnomoh might at various times appear in the form of any race that inhabits Norrath.  He was actually good friends with the merchants and bartenders of Oggok.  He had shopped the magnificent markets of the Iksar.  Gnomoh was probably the most traveled adventurer Ironhom had ever met.<br><br>&quot;Grave tidings, Ironhom,&quot; Gnomoh stared into the fire with Ironhom as he spoke.  &quot;A Champion of Faydark is dead,  Lord Jaggedoak has fallen.&quot;<br><br>Ironhom face twisted up in pain,&quot;Who did this?&quot;  He reached to his back and drew his massive Blade of Xalgoz.<br><br>Gnomoh continued,&quot;I do not know yet.  The details are just arriving.  His companion Lashara is missing and presumed to be on a blood hunt.  There were reports that she threatened Maesyn Trueshot himself, but, I don't know if that could be possible.  Whatever the case, it is known she is out for revenge.  Most diturbing is....&quot;  Gnomoh stopped and looked at Ironhom.  He was applying Dwarven war paint to the braids in his beard.<br><br>&quot;As I was saying, there is a rumor that his corpse was reanimated and now walks the land as the undead.  It is said that this vile deed was performed by one of those Malfunction idiots.  I know no more than that at the moment.&quot;<br><br>Gnomoh looked at the Dwarf again.  Now Ironhom had placed the Blade of Xalgoz across his lap and was polishing it's edges.  He had also drawn his Centi Warhammer and placed it at his feet.  McAmber looked to him for another ale, but decided it would be better to fetch it herself.<br><br>Zanaq approached back from Halas.  &quot;Hail Ironhom, I have have more ale.&quot;  Ironhom simply stared into the fire and continued to polish the blade.  He began to sing an old Dwarven war chant in his native tongue.  It told of the heroism of the Bloodforge Brigade and how they saved Kaladim from the armies of the Ogres.  His visage was dread to all enemies of light.<br><br>Zanaq stared for a moment, then seated himself next to Gnomoh.  The two also began their preperations for adventure.  McAmber and the other two Barbarian rogues stopped their discussions, looked to the three, and began to tighten their leathers.  Ironhom sharpened his blade...........<br><br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Dwarven Paladin<br>Tallon Zek Server<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>It was all she could do to keep from screaming.<br><br>Helpless to stop the newest turn of events, Lashara watched from her hiding place in the underbrush, weeping softly as she watched the troll and gnome walk away together, with what remained of her ....love. Yes, she would admit that now, and what an idiot she had been to refuse to see it until he was dead. What a fool she was.<br><br>Braag's cry to Rallos Zek had awoken her, and scenting blood, the elf had abandoned her camp at such haste that she had forgotten to gather her weapons in her own defense. It had not mattered. She had arrived on the scence just in time to watch the troll mount the head of her former companion on his spear. Choking back a sob, the woman had fled the brush the minute the troll was out of sight, and with her great agility, scaled down the cliff to retrieve the ranger's broken and battered body on the rocks. Strapping the mutilated form to her back with so much love, she climbed back up and gently lifted the head from the stake and with her thread and needle, sewn the head back to the body. The spear, in her anger, she had tossed over the edge.<br><br>Of course sewing the head back on the corpse would not re-animate her friend. That was not her intent. No Ranger of Tunare's body would be left in such a fashion of dishonour, for scavengers to feed upon. This little techincality performed, Lashara paused an instant. She had every intention of tracking down a wizard so that he might freeze and preserve the remains. She did not know the extent of the powers the Clerics of Tunare possessed, but she was not without hope, and if nothing could be done to revive Judd, at least he would be given a proper burial.<br><br>But there was no time. The troll was comming back. Unable to flee in time with the cumbersome body in tow, and unable to stand and defend for her lack of weapons, she had no choice but to flee back to her place of hiding in the undergrowth and watch. She prayed softly that the troll would not note the changes in the state of the corpse and thus discover her presence. Luck would have it, that trolls are far too stupid, and Braag was too preoccupied to care much about the positioning of the body. Lashara watched in horror as the gnome reanimated the corpse of her beloved, and the group walked off together.<br><br>She started to persue, and then stopped. Such a fight would prove fatal, she had quickly determined. The troll must have been mighty in battle to defeat Judd, she was unarmored and weaponless, and, most importantly, there was little doubt in her mind that if she attacked, the troll would send Judd after her. Even though he was dead, and the body a mere shell, Lashara did not think she would have the heart to raise a sword against him, even if she had one.<br><br>In tears, the woman wandered back to her camp and cleared up her things. She could not stay here, sooner or later the troll would realize that Judd's head was sewn on to his body with stitches, and that someone would have to have made those stitches. She headed East.<br><br>In the middle of the night, something brushed her cheek. Lashara snatched at it angrily, her temper rising to a boil from all she had witnessed. She would crush it in her palm, til she glanced down at the tiny struggling form and realized it was a faerie noble. &quot;You!&quot; She spat angrily, though the Champions and the Fae share no ill will. &quot;You will go to Felewithe for me and bear a message to Icewind Novastorm. Inform him that the blade of Rallos has struck to heart of the Champions and our banished general has fallen. Inform him that the broken hearted will come in short order to his doorstep for guidance, and courage, though he serve the same great goddess that allowed this greatest of tragedies to occur. Tunare do I no longer serve, it is Erolissi who moves me now. Go now....small one, or in my woe I will hunt down your kith and kindred and feed them one by one to the frogloks.&quot;<br><br>Releasing her hand, she allowed the tiny fae to flutter out across the sea, directly to Felwithe. And Lashara walked onwards through the dark, unseeing, unthinking and unfeeling, save for the grief in her heart.<br><br>In Memorium,<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>"Little Miss Bow & Arrows"<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 35th sun <br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc - I take tremendous liberty in the storylines with the following story, but, it mainly affects only myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also allow Lashara to follow her own storylines (and possibly write about her power in battle).  I also have several stories that I may write once I get them straight about Ironhom Hammerforge.<br><br><br>Judd Jaggedoak left Lashara sleeping at the camp early that morning.  Never unaware she awoke and asked where he was going.  <br><br>&quot;I am restless, m'lady, and I will wander the hills until the sun arises.  Then I will return&quot;, with that he set off into the darkness.<br><br>Something had been nagging at the wood elf's consciousness since the news of Icewind's woes reached him.  Jaggedoak was sorry he and Lashara had not reached High Keep in time for the high council.  His wounds from the battle with the Tier'Dal assasin had slowed him down.  <br><br>Lashara suggested that they camp at the foothills to Highkeep in East Karana for a few days.  Judd eargerly agreed.  He had reached a point where he could not imagine being without Lashara.  Although he had not spoke to her of his feelings, he hoped she felt the same.  Perhaps this had something to do with his agitated state of mind.<br><br>After traveling far from the camp Judd approached the road carved into the side of the mountains leading to Highkeep.  He continued for sometime up into the mountains.  A night fog obscured much of the way before him, so he began to move with more caution.  Luclin brightened the night sky from high above.  <br><br>A massive form appeared on the road in front of him.  It wore a great horned helm and armor of black steel.  Spiked gauntlets covered it's fists.  The evening fog swirled around the mysterious warrior and Judd gripped his sword and spear.  The figure stood still and offered no hail.<br><br>&quot;Hail stranger, who goes there?&quot; Judd called to it.   The massive warrior simply drew out a tremendous sword at least twice as long as Jaggedoak was tall.   The ranger quickly drew his weapons.  &quot;I have no quarrel with you stranger, why do you draw on me?&quot;<br><br>At last the other spoke,&quot;Quarrel Jaggedoak?  You have no quarrel with me?  How mistaken you are.  You left for me dead in the Eastern Wastes,  you betrayed me.  Now my revenge is here, it simply walked up to me no less.  Rallos truly honors me.&quot;<br><br>Shock and disbelief crossed Judd's face,&quot;Braag?  Who sent you?  What is going on, whom do you serve?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am free Jaggedaok,&quot;  Braag raised the breat broadsword towards the sky,&quot;I serve no one but Rallos Zek.  To him I give all glory from battle!&quot; and with that said the troll charged Jaggedoak.<br><br>Jaggedoak cast a snare on Braag as he rumbled down the road.  It did nothing to slow the enraged warrior.  Judd thrust his spear; Braag deftly parried it and brought his sword up and around in a move too fast for even Jaggedoak to be ready for.  The blade crashed through Judd's ivy leggings and sliced his muscle to the bone.  Stunned, he stepped back.  His footing slipped at the edge of the road.   Judd began to flail, realizing it would be a rocky fall to death in the crevice far below. <br><br>Braag, now perhaps the greatest trollen warrior, lost no time to take advantage of of Judd's predicament.  Grinning evily, he ripped his sword upwards splitting open Judd's midsection.  With what agility Jaggedoak had left he fell forward, away from the precepice.  Braag grabbed him by the hair, and with a tremendous roar of triumph, cleaved Jaggedoak's head from his body. <br><br>&quot;RALLOS, TO YOU ANOTHER VOCTORY!&quot; Braag bellowed into the night, holding the ranger's head high.  Laughing, he looted Judd's lifeless corpse and dropped into the ravine far below.  His spine shivered with delight as he heard the corpse tunble and splat off of the rocks into the bottom of the ravine.  He threw most of the &quot;junk&quot; he found on the ranger over the side also.  He kept the sword, although it was rather small.  Braag figured for him it would make a good dagger.  He jammed Jaggedoak's spear into the middle of the road, made sure it held fast, and mounted Jaggedoak's head upon it.  The head lolled to the side a little so Braag shoved it down a little futher, relishing in the squishing sounds it made.<br><br>Not looking back, Braag continued down the road towards the Karanas.  He would make his way to Grobb now.  There were those in the troll city who deserved a firsthand demonstration of his ne devotion to Rallos Zek.<br><br>So ended the life of the noble Champion of Faydark, Judd Jaggedoak.  He died banished from his homeland, slain by one he betrayed.  His dreams never lived out and his feelings never made true to those he loved.  Only one being witnessed his demise, that being his goddess Tunare, and a new tree was planted on the Plane of Growth in his honor. <br><br><em id=fs8>Edited, Thu Jan 17 12:55:56 2002</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>After speaking with many &quot;experts&quot; I have decided to return to the Windows XP operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly this comes on the reccomendation of an EQ computer engineer I talked to and the person who originally built my computer.<br><br>First I had to purchase a UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply).  This handy little device maintains a consistent 115v to my computer of &quot;clean electricity&quot;.  My friend tested the outlets in the room where my computer is set up and they had severe &quot;dirty electricity&quot; problems.  The current to my computer was dipping as far down as 75v to surges of 120v everytime the furnace, refridgerator, washer, dryer or microwave was turned on.  It is winter here, although a mild one, and the furnace runs all day long.  This &quot;dirty electricity&quot; was severely messing with my computer.  The FAT32 I was using was becoming severely corrupted.  This power supply problem was most likely the root of all my computer woes for the past 5 months. <br><br>As for the switch back to XP: anyone who reads here knows I was not happy with it.   But, I was assured with proper maintenance it is the optimal operating system to run.  Plus, my computer geek friend and EQ tech support said that since it uses NTFS instead of FAT32, that I should have far fewer problems in the long run. <br><br>I have been playing all my EQ at a friends house when I have spare time.  I have only been using Ironhom Hammerforge, my dwarven paladin.  He's level 28 and has died six times in the last week during Permafrost raids.  At least some things never change.  I will most likely be on this Sunday morning on the Roleplaying server as Subutai my barb beastlord.<br><br>I am still considering the move of my ranger to another server.  Most likely I will move him to Lashara's server so he can be with a ranger who knows far more than he does about being a ranger.  I have to wait until next month though because I just purchased a new car for my girlfriend and dumped money into my computer and paid taxes and bought groceries and finished of the very last of my school loans and I am flat broke.  Besides, I have some serious gaming to catch up on with Ironhom.  All my pvp friends are now level 33 to 35 and have passed me during my computer troubles.  <br><br>See you all In Game!<br><br>Ironhom Hammerforge<br>Dwarven Paladin<br>Tallon Zek Server  <br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>

He had survived countless battles of training against the Frost Giants of Kael Drakkal.  Only when the giant's began to run out of opponents for Braag did they accept him as a follower of Rallos.  Then he ventured out into the snows and slew one hundred Coldain.  He did not eat them; he simply left their lifeless corpses to freeze on the wastes.  Once dead, a foe meant nothing to Braag.  But, the Frost Giants said Braag must avenge any betrayal against him, and so, Jaggedoak's life was forfiet before Braag's might.<br><br>He came upon the Gnomish Pirates who once treated him as a friend.  Braag wondered what kind of foes they might be.  He slew them all and moved on.  Jaggedoak would be his, and anyone else who stood in his way.

	   <tr><td colspan=2>The two walked in silence through the snow and the wind. Lashara continually glanced over her shoulder to make sure they were not being followed. Judd, who was obviously lost in thought, did not make any attempts at conversation, and she was equally careful not to interrupt him. <br><br>--<br><br>Hours later the pair was almost to the opening of Blackburrow, the lair of the gnolls. Suddenly the woman stopped. Judd stopped too, and looked curiously at his friend. He was about to question her, when she turned her head and fixed him with a worried look. &quot;Shhhhh. Can you hear that?&quot;<br><br>Judd strained to hear in the silence of the falling night. For a long moment, he heard nothing but his own breathing and the pounding of his heart. Then quietly, he was able to pick up the crunch of feet in the snow. Several feet. He glanced at Lashara questioningly when the shrill yapping of a gnoll pierced the air. Lashara ripped her Dragon Horn Ykesha from its hold and ran around the snow drift that obscured her view. Then she screamed.<br><br>Unnerved, Judd took off after her, brandishing his weapons as well. Her scream had bothered him deeply. The last time he'd heard such a noise escape her lips had been when her fingers where cleaved off in the dungeon of the troll king. But this scream was no scream of pain, rather, one of fury. He rounded the corner to find a gnoll scout flopping weakly in the snow, its fur afire. Judd grimaced as the stench of burnt flesh filled his nostrils, and turned his gaze away, towards the wood elf female who was kneeling in the snow a little further off.<br><br>Judd approached her quickly, concerned for his friend. Her weapons lay fallen in the snow, dropped in her haste, and she was bent over the body of a white wolf, craddling its head in her lap. She was trying to hold a deep gash in the animal's side closed with her fingers, and at the same time wrap it with a bandage. The wolf lifted it head weakly to snarl at Judd as he approached. Lashara laid her hand on the wolf's neck and softly whispered. &quot;It is okay Miokono....he is a friend.&quot; Reassured, the wolf's head slumped back down into her lap.<br><br>Judd knelt by the wolf to help his friend, by taking over from her in holding the gaping wound closed. But the blood spurting between his fingers continued, and despite their efforts at closing the wound, soon thereafter the animal's form went slack, and it's breathing ceased. The wolf was dead.<br><br>Judd stood up in silence, and respectfully bowed his head in acknowledgement of the animal's passing. He watched in silence as Lashara gathered the limp form in her arms, and cradled it softly, like a baby. Then she slowly stood up. Judd moved to help her, then stopped, something instinctive telling him that his help would not be welcomed. He only watched as the woman carried the dead animal over the side of a snow drift and laid it gently down, then picked up her sword and thrust it into the side of the bank, loosening a cascade of snow that fell over the body. She stepped back from the mound of snow, and with a few softly spoken words and a wave of her hand, thorn covered vines sprang up from the frozen earth and wrapped around the icy grave to ensure that the body contained therein would not be disturbed by scavengers. She paused for a moment, then turned and walked back to where Judd stodd, picking up her discarded equipment as she came.<br><br>&quot;We can continue now.&quot; Lashara said softly, almost apologetically. Though she was careful not to look directly at him, Judd thought he saw tears in his friend's eyes. Wordlessly he nodded, and the two walked on in silence through the snow.<br><br>They continued through the Everfrost Peaks, and then up the hill that would lead them into the tunnels to Blackburrow. In the gloom, a gnoll growled threateningly at the two elves. Lashara swung her bow off her shoulder, and sent an arrow sailing into the creature. But instead of putting the bow back on her shoulder, Lashara took down another arrow from her quiver and proceeded further into the caverns, bow at the ready. The instant another gnoll stepped into view it's life was terminated by the twang of her bowstring. She took down another arrow, repeated the process.<br><br>Judd glanced in suprise at his normally soft spoken, mild-mannered friend. Her jaw was set stubbornly, and the hate and anger that flared in her green eyes when she looked upon the gnolls reminded him all took much of a child of Innoruk's. They passed through all of Blackburrow in this manner, the woman slaying any gnoll she spied.<br><br>As the pair stepped out into the Hills of Qeynos, Lashara finall swung her bow back onto her shoulder. Judd, who had been holding his breath up til this point, finally felt it was safe to speak, without risking getting an arrow fired in his direction too.<br><br>&quot;I am sorry for your loss, Lashara. Was the wolf a companion of yours?&quot; He asked gently, trying to be as kind as possible in his enquiry.<br><br>The woman paused, and swallowed hard. He realized she was struggling to speak without breaking into tears again. She looked down at the ground a moment, then up directly into his eyes. Judd marvelled at the rich green of her eyes. It seemed they grew more lovely each time he looked at them. The woman smiled gently, and answered.<br><br>&quot;No. The wolves are all my children.&quot;<br><br>Then she turned away from him and headed east.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lashara Dyran<br>"Little Miss Bow & Arrows"<br>Keeper of the wolves<br>Ranger of the 35th sun <br>Lanys T'Vyl</td></tr>

	   <tr><td colspan=2>/ooc<br><br>I started my Barbarian Beastlord on the roleplaying server Fironia Vie.&nbsp;&nbsp;I made it to level 3 so far and I have started several quests.  For now, he is just fighting with his bare fists, but I will have him learn piercing also.  Subutai will not learn 1HB or 2HB.  He doesn't like clubs and sticks or hammers.  That's just the way it is.  But he will occasionally spear something.  Most of all, he likes to beat on mobs with his fists.  It sure is fun beating up polar bear cubs with your bare hands.  He is a true Barbarian.  Mostly, these early levels are about beating on things constantly until level 9, so that's what I'm doing.  Subutai follows the Six Hammers and I suspect he will choose a neutral alignment at level 10.  For now he is just going to run around Everfrost as a pugilist and flirt with barbarian women, as any barbarian should.<br>&nbsp;<br>Judd Jaggedoak <br>(deceased)<br>Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br><br><br></td></tr>
