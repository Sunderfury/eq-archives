	 </table> Druid Epic Quest Walkthrough <br><br> The Start <br><br> - Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods: ask "what action" and you will get a note. if not, then your faction is too low. Faction can be built up fast by doing the muffin-quest in Freeport <br><br> - Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark: give her the note and you receive a ring. Faelin roams the northern part of the zone near Crushbone. She is a rare spawn and can have orcs as placeholders. After giving her the note she depops. <br><br> - Giz X'Tin Kithikor: give him the ring, get a dark metal coin. Giz roams along the path. After u hand him the ring a lvl 50 Darkelf Reaver spawns and attacks but u can run away with SoW. <br><br> - Go back to Telin Darkforest and give him the Coin. He will give it back to you as worn metal coin. He tells you to find Athele. <br><br> - Athele in East Karanas: give her the Coin and receive a worn amulet. give this amulet to Sionae, then to Nuien and finaly to Teloa. The last step is the trigger for the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Darkwlf Reavers (all about lvl 50) to spawn. <br><br> - Find the Corruptor and kill him fast. He will depop after 10 seconds if not attacked. The 2 Reavers will head to the 4 Druids and kill them. You dont need to kill the Reavers. Just kill the corruptor and loot the tome. If the Druids die, never mind....Athele spawns again in about 1 hour. Give Athele the tome and get an earthstained Note. Bring this to "she who walks the land in service blabla...". <br><br> - Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket is this wanted women that wanders the zone. Give her the earthstained note and she will tell you that she needs a mixture. She will give you her mixing bowl. It is a Container so you need a free slot in the Inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl that she needs. <br><br>The Hardened Mixture <br><br> - You must forage 4 items that you have to combine in Ella's mixing bowl. <br><br> - Frozen Tundra Root from Everfrost Peaks <br><br> - Sweetened Mudroots from Misty Thicket <br><br> - Speckled Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp <br><br> - Heartfruit from Greater Faydark <br><br> - This can take several hours. Combine those 4 items in the bowl and you get a Hardened -Mixture. <br><br>The Runed Bowl <br><br> - Go to the Chess Island (succor will take you there when you have enterd the zone) in Timorous Deep and ask Alrik Farsight "how do you make an ancient bowl?". He gives you a crushed pot and sends you to Felwithe. <br><br> - Talk to Farios Elianos in Felwithe south. If he dont respond to you then your faction with Keepers of the Art is too low. You can build up faction fast with the batwing-quest in Felwithe south. If Farios talks to you, give him the pot and you receive a grocery list. He will give you the receipt for the bowl if you do a job for him. <br><br> - Bring this grocery list to Merchant Nora in Felwithe north and she gives you in return a bag of Provisions. Bring it to Farios and he gives you the receipt for the ancient bowl. <br><br> - Head back to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep . He will give you an ancient pattern when you give him the receipt. <br><br> - The pattern says that you have to combine it with a piece of echanted clay and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel. NO skill in pottery required.<br><br> - Platinum speckled powder can be obtained through another subquest. Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan Fleetwood in Surefall Glades. The old wooden painting that you receive has to be brought to the human skeleton that roams the western part of Frontier Mountains. Head back with the silver chained locket you got from the skeleton to Surefall Galdes and give it to Niera Farbreeze. She hands you the platinum speckled pouder. <br><br> - Enchanted clay can be obtained through Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's Everhot Forge. If you ask him "what mud" and "do it for me" he will tell you that he would like to have a colored axe for his service. This is a Jade Reaver that can be found in the City of Mist. Hand him the axe and you get the enchanted clay. I think that if you are kos to the dwarfs then you can do this part invisible. Just go to the Everhot Forge and hand Kinlo a Jade Reaver to get the clay.<br><br> - Now combine the pattern, clay and powder in any pottery wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl <br><br>The Stones <br><br> - Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the hardened mixture and the rune crested bowl. She will make for you a softly glowing stone from it. <br><br> - Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the Druids this means to seek out Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie. <br><br> - Ask her "are you one such as myself?", "what answers?" and "what about Venril Sathir?". She tells you to bring her the stone you already have from Ella and the gem that can be found on Venril Sathir. <br><br> - Kill Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle and loot the gem he drops. Venril is a very tough level 55 Necromancer that can only be beaten by very strong guilds. <br><br> - Give the gem and the softly glowing stone to Foloal Stromforest and get a warm pulsating stone. Now this is the time where the quest splits up into the Druid and the Ranger parts. Foloal tells you to take the stone and walk your path. <br><br> - The Druid's path leads back to Ealla in Misty Thicket. Give her the stone and you will get the Elaborate Scimitar (10/30 9wis 10mana 5sv poison and disease)...now you have one of the four final pieces. She asks you to collect the Cleansed Spirits of Antonica, Faydwer and Kunark and hand them along with the scimitar to Xanuusus. <br><br><br>The Cleansed Spirits <br><br>The Cleansed Spirit of Antonica <br><br> - The withered treant in North Karana tells you to find the corruption in the land. He means the Corrupted Mammoth (below lvl 30) in Everfrost Peaks (pops near Permafrost, Mammoth Calfs are PH), the Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman (mid lvl 30) in Lake Rathe (PH are the sidespawns on top of the underwater-tower. Middle spawn is for Cleric Epic. Use wolfform to be non-aggro to the other goblins. They heal each other so kite him away. It can take several tainted to get the corrupted) and the Corrupted Hill Giant (mid lvl 30) in Rathe Mountains (HG area south of the hill with the Guard Tower).<br><br> - Give the 3 items looted from them to the treant to receive the treant heart. Go to Yeka Ias in South Karanas and give him the heart. He will give you the Cleansed Spirit of Antonica. <br><br>The Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer <br><br> - You will meet a pained Unicorn in lesser Faydark. Collect for him the items looted from the Corrupted Seahorse in Kedge Keep (lvl 52, 1 or 2 groups needed. As far as I can remeber you have to pass the area where Estrella is and the named Seahorse), the Corrupted Cyclops (3-4 ppl, best tactic is fearkiting because he is lvl 52. PH are the Seafury Cyclops) in Ocean of Tears and from the Corrupted Brownie (Brownie Scouts are PH. They are green to 56/57 and give exp. Each can pop the tainted so it is possible that 2 or even 3 tainted roam the area. They are druids and the corrupted is a lvl 52 druid so you need help from 2 or 3 people. Fearkiting is the best tactic) in Lesser Faydark.<br><br> - The Unicorn will give you a gleaming horn for the 3 items. This has to be handed to the gnome Silox Azrix in Ak'anon to get the Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer. He is near the mines on the left side of the green river. There is another greeny gnome near him but you can do this part with super camou on you if you are kos or otherwise disliked there because you need no faction for Silox.<br><br>The Cleansed Spirit of Kunark <br><br> - Ulump Pujik, a named Froglok in Swamp of no Hope tells you to give his own essence along with the 3 corrupted things to the gnome that hurts the land.  Kill Ulump and loot his Essence. Ulump is a lvl 55 warrior that doubles for 250 and he has 32k hp. He can't be slowed or tashed. You should have 2 groups with 4-6 melee and 2-4 nukers (all as high lvl as possible) to kill him. Lure spells hit for full damage.<br><br> - The 3 corrupted mobs of Kunark are the Corrupted Gorilla (mid 40)in Emerald Jungle (root/dot him and stay far away. He has sow-speed and pops in the northern part of the plateau. Tottering Gorillas are PH of the tainted and only non-undead tainted will pop the corrupted), the Corrupted Barracuda (high 40,loc -900, -900) in Lake of ill Omen (only the blue tainted will pop the corrupted. Pull it on the land and kite him becaus root breaks fast. Would be much easier if you have a friend that helps you kill the corrupted) and the Dragon Faydawer that lives in the sea in Timorous Deep (Guild needed to kill him).<br><br> - Hand the 4 items to the Gnome Nekexin Virulence in overthere to get the Cleansed Spirit of Kunark. <br><br>The End <br><br> - Hand the 3 Cleansed Spirits and the scimitar to Xanuusus the treant in North Karanas to receive the Druid Epic Weapon. <br><br>All the parts that haven't mentioned how many poeple you need can be done solo.</td></tr>

There have also been a large numbers of re-posts of previously determined facts as well as posts of things that have already been ruled out.<br><br>Cheyenne Goldenleaf wrote these EXQUISITE sumarys and except for a new gnome spawn in L-fay seem to be the most complete to date.<br><br>PLEASE DO NOT WASTE SPACE BY FLAMING PEOPLE ASKING FOR INFORMATION.<br><br>PLEASE DO NOT WASTE SPACE BY FLAMING PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO LAZY TO FING THE INFORMATION OUT THERE.<br><br>PLEASE DO NOT FLAME PEOPLE FOR PROVIDING REDUNDANT / INACCURATE INFORMATION.<br><br>If the board was cleaner they wouldn't be making these posts.....<br><br>.... now lets get out there and solve this quest!<br><br>(wulfborn only 31st lvl druid Karana)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>This may nots be correct until someone finishes and listes what them did, buts me haves seen a few requests for listin, so me will list it outs. First, it seem to haves two main areas, Telin in Burnin Woods, and Corrupted animals across Norrath. Their are many that believe that this area is nots for druids, buts rangers. Or other area is for rangers and nots druids, buts since no one haves finished it, me will just puts the information outs for everyone. <br><br>Telin Darkforest - Burnin Woods - location p3250, p2850 <br>- gives Worn Note to takes to Faelin Bloodbriar - Greater Fay - location p1501, p522 <br>(orc is place holder, keep killin orc and Faelin will show) <br>- Faelin gives you ring dor dark elfie, Giz X'Tin in Kithicor Woods - locayion Him wanders abouts <br>(a dark elfie reaver instantly appear, you not haves to kill him, so RUN !!) <br>- take Coin from Giz backs to Telin in Burnin Woods <br>- Telin will gives coin backs and ask you takes it to Arch Druid Althele in East K - location west of waterfall with halflin and wolf. <br>(haves friends, lvl 50+ with you for this part) <br>(high lvl Ranger as tracker would helps, Ranger not haves to be in fight if them too low) <br>- Althele will give necklace for Sionae - East K use trackin <br>- Sionae gives amulet and tells you to find Nuien - East K use trackin <br>- Nuien gives back amulet and say find Teola - East K use trackin <br>- Teola gives amulet backs and ask you to follow to gatherin <br>- a dark elf Corruptor and two Reavers appear. Kill Corruptor and loot book from him. <br>- Give Book to Althele, she gives to Tholris, Tholris gives you Earth Stained Note <br>- Ella Foodcrafter - Misty Thicket - Location she run from wall to near RiverVale <br>- giver her note. She gives you bowl so haves one OPEN GENERAL INVENTORY space or bowl will not appear and you MIGHT haves to repeat all this. <br><br>Ella talks of mixture and of Ancient Bowl. Me haves found, and confirmed, that Bandit Runner in Qeynos Hills haves Enchanted Clay and Accursed Paint. Is clay to make Ancient Bowl ?? Is Accursed Paint for Ancient Bowl ?? Me not know until quest is complete but me wants to mention it so you know this too Runner start near zone pass to West K, and run behind guard tower toward Qeynos. Runner is half elfie fighter. <br>It thought that their is recipe to makes ancient bowl outs their somewhere. It haves been reported, buts NOT COMFIRMED that if you gives Ancient Bowl and Mixture to Ella, she gives Druid only Helmut and then tells you abouts Corrupted animals. That is section 2 me will types next. <br><br>The new foraged, druid and ranger only foods. Them will NOTS have small number in bottom right corner cause them are lore and no drop. <br><br>- Chilled Tundra Root - Everfrost <br>- Ripened HeartFruit - Greater Fay <br>- Speckled Molded Mushroom - Innothule Swamp <br>- Sweetened Mudroot - Misty Thicket <br><br>Placin them in bowl and combine will gives mixture. <br><br>Remember, this is not postive listin of druid quest, it mights be ranger or someting else. Me have Paladin friend that got Worn note from Telin, so until new epic druid quest IS solved try to keeps open mind. Helps by findin clues or answers so all druids can win together. <br><br>Cheyenne Goldenleaf <br>of Bubbling Falls <br>- Xegony -<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Hello again !! *waves* This section covers Corrupted animals across Norrath. Once again, their are some that say this for rangers, or this for druids. Until Ranger or Druid quest is finished and listed, it not solved. So keeps open mind, helps by finding answers to clues and maybe all druids or rangers can win together <br><br>Since their is no clear beginnin to this section, and yes their are many thats will argue even abouts this, me will list Hurt Animal Quest givers from West to East across Norrath. <br><br>** Important ** <br>If Treant, Pained Unicorn, or Ulump not where them supposed to be, me do nots know how to gets them backs.

Him mean Nekexin Virulence - OverTheir - p3670, p785 near outpost so be carefuls <br><br>When you ask Nekexin abouts corruption... <br>[Sat Sep 30 11:49:47 2000] Nekexin Virulence glowers at you dubiously -- what would you like your tombstone to say? <br>[Sat Sep 30 11:50:01 2000] You say, 'hail Nekexin Virulence' <br>[Sat Sep 30 11:50:04 2000] You say, 'what corruption?' <br>[Sat Sep 30 11:50:05 2000] Nekexin Virulence grins wide at you. 'Corruption? I know nothing of corruption.' He goes back to staring out over the water. <br><br>Their many guesses abouts what 3rd animal of Kunark is, or why Ulump say, you must kill me and take essence to tiny priest, buts no one know for sure yets. <br><br>Me sharing information so everyone can win together, druid or ranger.
