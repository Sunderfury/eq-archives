This clan was created because me and saucy<br>
were pretty damn bored because our original<br>
clan ( [sNs] - <a href="http://www.slapsnskinner.com">www.slapsnskinner.com</a> ) pretty<br>
much died after our co-lo server got killed.<p>
I'm not going to do anything for this page<br>
because 1) I'm a lazy bitch, and 2) there is<br>
no need to update it considering we are only<br>
two people, and we don't need to have everyone<br>
know what is going on.  Anyways, me and Saucy are<br>
also now clanned in <a href="http://www.b00m.net/omega9/">Omega 9</a> cause they r0x0r.<p>
<a href="http://kotisivu.raketti.net/wadez/ter.jpg">This</a> picture is just wrong. Hopefully this site<br>
will die soon enough. They should rot in hell.<p>
