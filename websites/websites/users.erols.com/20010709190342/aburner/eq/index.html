Some folks on the Gnome Message Board on EQStratics wanted to see pics of Gnomes In Action(tm).  So here are my pics!<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ruatha001.html">Picture #1</a> - Here's me fooling around with a big ol' smelly ogre! 
<li><a href="ruatha002.html">Picture #2</a> - Here I am perched precariously on the pointy part of a pedestal in one of the fountains in the Unrest courtyard. 
<li><a href="ruatha003.html">Picture #3</a> - That big pile of snow suuure looks familiar! 
<li><a href="ruatha004.html">Picture #4</a> - Here I am showing off my bronze armor.  This was taken JUST after I'd bought the breastplate. 
<li><a href="ruatha005.html">Picture #5</a> - Hey!  What's that over there? 
<li><a href="ruatha006.html">Picture #6</a> - Here I am modeling the leather armor for female gnomes.  Note how it looks a LOT like a pair of pajamas with footies. 
<li><a href="ruatha007.html">Picture #7</a> - Woo!  What an array of feminine beauty! 
<li><a href="ruatha008.html">Picture #8</a> - You'll just have to imagine the keen "Six Million Dollar Man" F/X here... 
<li><a href="ruatha009.html">Picture #9</a> - Me and a halfling druid take on a mammoth! 
<li><a href="ruatha010.html">Picture #10</a> - Here I am in Neriak, my home away from home!  I like it 'cause it's underground, just like Ak'Anon! 
<li><a href="ruatha011.html">Picture #11</a> - Here I am making friends with a giant skeleton in the Rathe Mountains! 
<li><a href="ruatha012.html">Picture #12</a> - Here's me and my friend Dakagar after we'd just dispatched TWO Cyclopes.  (Okay, so we had a little help from Draekil the Druid and Raniella the Cleric.  But still!) 
<li><a href="ruatha013.html">Picture #13</a> - Dak and I go at another Cyclops.  Draekil the Puppy...er...Druid is in the background keeping us both healed up!
<li><a href="ruatha014.html">Picture #14</a> - This was taken JUST after I'd spent 819pp and traded an Avenger Axe to get my Crafted BP, the last piece of Crafted Armor I needed.  I'd been trying for a couple of months to get the Crafted BP, and FINALLY I had it!  WooHoo!  Note the signature 2-handed sideswipe we gnome females use for our 2-handed slashing weapons.
<li><a href="ruatha015.html">Picture #15</a> - And this is a picture of me taken exactly one week after I'd bought my Crafted BP.  I spent 2 months real time trying to get a Crafted BP, I wore it for exactly a week, and then someone made me an offer I couldn't refuse on an Enamelled Black BP.  SAVOR THE IRONY!
<li><a href="ruatha016.html">Picture #16</a> - FLASHBACK!  Here's a pic of me as a young Gemchopper (fresh from getting my last name!) meeting with another female Gemchopper, my friend Srenye.
<li><a href="ruatha017.html">Picture #17</a> - Here's me in my low 30s (still with the bronze BP) with Hatsumomo, a fellow Gemchopper.
<li><a href="ruatha018.html">Picture #18</a> - Gnomes are the only race in Norrath that cannot be shrunk by the Shaman <i>Shrink</i> spell or potion.  There's a reason for this, as my Barbarian warrior buddy Hilorm demonstrates in this picture.
<li><a href="ruatha019.html">Picture #19</a> - This is the (cleared out) front of Mistmoore Castle.  This was taken during our first (and only, and eventually fatal and aborted) attempt to make it to the Kitchen via the brute force method of just fighting our way to the area.  Shortly after this picture was taken, two of my group members lay dead in the front entrance hall of the Castle, and I was standing dazed and confused in the Druid circle in East Karana.  It was very shortly after this incident that we adopted the "sneak in invisible" method of reaching the Kitchen.
<li><a href="ruatha020.html">Picture #20</a> - This is me immediately after getting my first Wakky.  The toothpick in my offhand is a Dragoon Dirk.
<li><a href="ruatha021.html">Picture #21</a> - This is me immediately after getting my second Wakky.  All I need now is a haste sash and you can call me Little Miss Whirling Blades of Death(tm)!
<li><a href="ruatha022.html">Picture #22</a> - This is my good friend and guildmate Ibamn Greyfalcon, shortly after he became the first Erudite Paladin on the Brell Serilis server to obtain the coveted Soulfire!  Way to go Ib!
<li><a href="ruatha023.html">Picture #23</a> - A gnome's-eye view of a Kunark rhino!
<li><a href="ruatha024.html">Picture #24</a> - I'm not sure WHAT this is, aside from RILLY BIG!  I think it's a globe of Norrath's moon.  There's another one that looks like the Sun, maybe.  And still another one that looks like Norrath itself.
<li><a href="ruatha025.html">Picture #25</a> - Cue the John Phillip Sousa march music!
<li><a href="ruatha026.html">Picture #26</a> - Looking out of a cave into the jungle known as Trakanon's Teeth!
<li><a href="ruatha027.html">Picture #27</a> - Here I am, about to get my butt kicked by a flower!  <I>&lt;Feel free to insert jokes about Triffids, "flower power," and so on here&gt;</I>
<li><a href="ruatha028.html">Picture #28</a> - A skorpikis.  I <I>used</i> to not be KOS to these critters.  A lotta time spent hunting in Karnor's Castle fixed <i>that</i> pretty quickly...
<li><a href="ruatha029.html">Picture #29</a> - Everybody should take the time to stop and smell the flowers!
<li><a href="ruatha030.html">Picture #30</a> - My view as I run levitated over the snow-covered mountains of the Dreadlands at dawn.
<li><a href="ruatha031.html">Picture #31</a> - Woo!  Check my AGI and my encumberance in this shot!  Man, that ore weighs a TON!

<ul>
<li><a href="ruatha032.html">Picture #32</a> - My friend Boppo the Halfling Rogue loaned me his Phase Spider Carapace Breastplate so I could see what it looked like on a female gnome warrior.  Isn't it just spiffy looking?
<li><a href="ruatha033.html">Picture #33</a> - Somewhere inside this cloud of yellow and green is a bad guy I'm trying to kill...
<li><a href="ruatha034.html">Picture #34</a> - And for my next trick...
<li><a href="ruatha035.html">Picture #35</a> - My friend Draekil says that this is supposed to help your complexion.  I'm a bit skeptical, frankly...
<li><a href="ruatha036.html">Picture #36</a> - This is the Geonid Menhir.  Shortly after this picture was taken, the Menhir exploded all over my friend Draekil and nearly killed him.
<li><a href="ruatha037.html">Picture #37</a> - This is a nifty picture of an Othmir Shaman.  I like the Othmir 'cause they're silly!  (They smell like fish, though...)
<li><a href="ruatha038.html">Picture #38</a> - It's my long-lost Barbarian cousin!
<li><a href="ruatha039.html">Picture #39</a> - Lady Vox in all her glory!
<li><a href="ruatha040.html">Picture #40</a> - My new friend Jelen turns into a Grizzly Bear to protect me!
<li><a href="ruatha041.html">Picture #41</a> - This is a pic of Stalkous the Iksar Warrior standing on the head of Rodarin the Wood Elf Warrior.  (Don't ask me why.  Wood Elves and Iksars are a little wierd sometimes...)
<li><a href="ruatha042.html">Picture #42</a> - WARNING:  Never try to teach a Troll how to play "pattycake".  Mere seconds after this picture was taken, I was halfway across the room and upside down.
<li><a href="ruatha043.html">Picture #43</a> - Up close and personal with Lady Vox!
<li><a href="ruatha043a.html">Picture #43a</a> - My new friend Nynalie the Wood Elf Druid took this picture.  I grabbed it 'cause it's got a great shot of me standing under Lady Vox thwacking at the dragon's stomach!  That's me there under Vox's front leg.
<li><a href="ruatha044.html">Picture #44</a> - And she's down for the count!  This was my very first time to fight a dragon, and it was FUN!  (Especially 'cause I didn't die...)
<li><a href="ruatha045.html">Picture #45</a> - Hiya everybody!  Having a great time killing dragons!  Wish you were here!  --Love, Ru.
<li><a href="ruatha046.html">Picture #46</a> - After we killed Vox, I ran around and checked out her lair.  Looks like <i>this</i> guy didn't quite make it.  Creepy, isn't it?
<li><a href="ruatha047.html">Picture #47</a> - Here's my friend Scaleroo bunny-hopping back from irritating a Fire Giant.  This was the very first raid ever hosted by Wings of Honor, and Scaley did a FANTABULOUS job!
<li><a href="ruatha048.html">Picture #48</a> - This is Xaxx, the Iksar Monk who helped us on our FG raid.  Here he is teasing a fire giant.
<li><a href="ruatha049.html">Picture #49</a> - Woo!  Now that we've gotten rid of that silly King Tranixx, I can play around on his throne!
<li><a href="ruatha050.html">Picture #50</a> - I am <i>so</i> glad these Fire Giant models aren't anatomically correct...
<li><a href="ruatha051.html">Picture #51</a> - While preparing for my 2nd Vox raid in 3 days, I found a gnome-sized Ice Giant to play with.  Isn't he just the cutest?
<li><a href="ruatha052.html">Picture #52</a> - And here we go again!  I'm sure that we all looked very scary as we slowly <i>walked</i> up to Vox en masse...
<li><a href="ruatha053.html">Picture #53</a> - Vox goes down again!  And I didn't die this time, either!  Woo!  49 levels without ever doing a Plane Raid or a Dragon Raid, and *whammo*, two successful Vox raids in three days.
<li><a href="ruatha054.html">Picture #54</a> - This is what a dead dragon looks like from the front.
<li><a href="ruatha055.html">Picture #55</a> - Here's me with my new friend Pelorus the Ogre Warrior.  No, he's not normally this tiny I don't think.
<li><a href="ruatha056.html">Picture #56</a> - I was completely speechless after I won this.  Only my 2nd Vox raid ever, and I win one of the most sought-after Tank items in the game.  WOW!
<li><a href="ruatha057.html">Picture #57</a> - It's a mini-Faydedar!
<li><a href="ruatha058.html">Picture #58</a> - Another picture of the mini-Faydedar, just 'cause I think they look neet!
<li><a href="ruatha059.html">Picture #59</a> - ERROR!  ERROR!
<li><a href="ruatha060.html">Picture #60</a> - Moments later, the two elf females sensed that the transporter experiment had gone horribly, horribly wrong...
<li><a href="ruatha061.html">Picture #61</a> - Boy, it sure does get chilly in Firiona Vie sometimes.  Fortunately, I found a handy fire...
<li><a href="ruatha062.html">Picture #62</a> - Here's me sneaking up on my friend Qualtar.
<li><a href="ruatha063.html">Picture #63</a> - This is a pretty picture of one of the mermaids in the Ocean of Tears.
<li><a href="ruatha064.html">Picture #64</a> - The pinnacle of Gnomish technology!  The flagship of the Gnomish Navy!  It's the ICEBREAKER!
<li><a href="ruatha065.html">Picture #65</a> - This is a neet looking windmill thingy near the Lake of Ill Omen.  It almost looks like Gnomes built it!
<li><a href="ruatha066.html">Picture #66</a> - This is the Tinkered Helmet for Gnomes.  Personally, I think it makes me look kinda nerdy...
<li><a href="ruatha067.html">Picture #67</a> - Seeing the world through the Tinkered Helmet for male gnomes...
<li><a href="ruatha068.html">Picture #68</a> - Getting ready to fight a Wurm in the Burning Woods.
<li><a href="ruatha069.html">Picture #69</a> - Okay!  Werewolf Calesthenics!  Jumping Jacks!  Ready?  Go!

<li><a href="ruatha071.html">Picture #71</a> - Never trust a merchant with his face on the side of his head...
<li><a href="ruatha072.html">Picture #72</a> - Sure does get windy in the Commonlands sometimes...
<li><a href="ruatha073.html">Picture #73</a> - Even though I'm in a tent, I can still see the moon!
<li><a href="ruatha074.html">Picture #74</a> - Up next in the Norrathian Olympics...  Synchronized Ogre Butt-scratching!
<li><a href="ruatha075.html">Picture #75</a> - Here's me stabbing myself in the head with an EBW.
