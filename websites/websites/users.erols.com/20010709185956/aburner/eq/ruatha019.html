<center><h3>This is the (cleared out) front of Mistmoore Castle.  This was taken during our first (and only, and eventually fatal and aborted) attempt to make it to the Kitchen via the brute force method of just fighting our way to the area.  Shortly after this picture was taken, two of my group members lay dead in the front entrance hall of the Castle, and I was standing dazed and confused in the Druid circle in East Karana.  It was very shortly after this incident that we adopted the "sneak in invisible" method of reaching the Kitchen.</h3></center>
