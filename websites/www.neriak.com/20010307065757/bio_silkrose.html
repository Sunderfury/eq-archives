Greetings,
</P>

<P>
My true birthname is Y’Trel N’Val, but please, call me Silkrose.  Why you ask, would one such as I, a Teir’Dal, wish to be known by such an unusual name?  I will explain it to you, so please take a seat, refill your glass and listen.  This is my story.
</P>

<P>
I was born the only daughter of R’Tath, master of house N’Val, in the dark city of Neriak, to a serving girl, whose name was never spoken after my birth.  My mother, whoever she was, died during childbirth and secretly, I think my father had something to do with her demise.  
</P>

<P>
Life in my father’s home was harsh.  I was treated with little to no respect by my three older brothers, or by my father.  I lived the life of a common servant from as long as I can remember.  Apparently, my father was a powerful necromancer and wished all of his children to follow the same path.  Shortly after my sixth birthday, it was discovered that I was magic-dead, and could not bring any glory to our house, so my fate was sealed.  I was cast out of my home, and sold as part of a contract between houses by my family.  I spent the formative part of my days as a serving girl in the Maiden’s Fancy, a terrible place where men, and some women, would go to enjoy the pleasures of both alcohol, and of the flesh.  
</P>

<P>
I spent many of my young years in the Maiden’s, cleaning tables, straightening rooms, and doing general cleaning duties, all the while dodging the lustful advances of lecherous men and women, who wished to partake of the activities of the houses fame.  As I grew up under these conditions, it was apparent that some of the ladies who resided therein, did not do so of their accord, such as I.  One lady, a human by the name of Cherise, took a kind of motherly liking to me.  She kept many of the patrons from taking advantage of me while I was young, and secretly trained me on how to take care of myself, if the need arised, thus giving the initial push towards the career that I now follow; that of a warrior.
</P>

<P>
Cherise was a kind soul, though very abused here and mistreated even worse than I ever was.  Apparently, she was viewed as a “delicacy” by the patrons, who would have their way with her, in 
whatever manner they so chose.  I could see in her eyes that she secretly longed for death, but inwardly, she felt a need to make sure that the same fate did not befall me.  In our few moments of peace, when we were alone, she would tell me of the world that lay outside the cold dark walls of Neriak.  The things she described to me, trees, animals, peoples, and mostly of the flowers that grew in the sunlit world, enthralled me and gave me a passion to strive to be free of my yoke of slavery.  For my fourteenth birthday, Cherise made for me, a dozen roses made of silk scraps that she had managed to gather.  These were my most cherished possessions.  Shortly afterward, Cherise was taken from the world in a fit of anger by one of the patrons who wished to have their way with me.  She had moved to protect me as the vicious bastard of a mage dragged me to a private room and he burned her to death before my eyes with his magics.  I cried out with all my heart and turned on him as he glared at me with malevolence in his eyes.  I pulled his own dagger from his belt and stabbed him repeatedly in his chest until his last gurgling breath ceased, his magics never to harm anyone ever again, least of all me.
</P>

<P>
The bar fell silent as I strode from the room in shock, the bloody dagger still gripped defiantly in my unshaking grasp.  Almost instantly those that were there set upon me, and if not for the other ladies of the Maiden’s, I most assuredly would have been slain that instant.  I was taken away from there and delivered to the Guild of Warriors.  The girls had bought my “freedom” with the little money they had managed to save for themselves, seeing a chance to save one of their own, by sacrificing their selves to the continuing slavery, but at least one would escape those hardships.  I almost wish I had stayed or been killed.  I can never repay the debt to those women, but I remember them in every breath I breathe as a freewoman.
</P>

<P>
Life in the Warrior’s Guild was harsh and brutal, but I proved myself time and time again in combat with the other students and even managed to occasionally impress one of the guild leaders.  Other than a few verbal assaults from the others there, usually about my lack of family and title, I continued to advance my training unhindered.  One day I was taken aside and told that my training was complete and that I would be released into the world as a member of the Indigo Brotherhood, to do as the guildmasters ordered.  Since I essentially had no true home, and hence no name, I chose to be known as you see me today, as Silkrose, in reverence for the one woman who truly seemed to care about me.  Cherise, I owe you my life, and I vow that I will use every bit of my skill to see that others do not suffer the fate that we had been forced into.
</P>

<P>
My new life, in the outside world of Norrath has been one of trials and tribulations, but also of one of profound wonder and amazement.  Many enemies have I fought, and many friends have I made, of those, my sisters in arms, the Daughters of Innoruuk are with me always, whether nearby, or simply in my heart.  I do not hold the same values as many of kin, but having seen much of the world, I do not tolerate the blind hatred of other races towards my people.  Though hatred, slavery and deceit have been the bane of my life, and the reason for my own personal outlook, it has also opened my eyes to the other possibilities that can be achieved.  And despite all the hardships they have brought, they have led me to where I am today; free of slavery, surrounded with friends, and in control of my own destiny.  There is no greater treasure a person could ever hold.

<P>
I am Silkrose.  This is my continuing story.
