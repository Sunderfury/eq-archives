The EverQuest Quote Rating Association of America (EQQRAA) has established
this rating system to reduce the amount of flaming a site maintainer
receives based on certain quotes from the game.  Basically, you were warned,
so don't go bitching at the site admin if some quote offends you ;p
</P>

<BR>

<H4>G</H4>

<P ID="main">
This rating denotes that the quote is for general audiences.  Please note
that EQ is not like the movies, and a G rating for an EQ quote has nothing
to do with a G rated movie!  These quotes might contain mild sexual
references and even some mild swear words (ass, damn, hell, etc).  These
quotes are things you would see in the game anywhere at any time.  If you
play EQ, this stuff shouldn't really offend you ;p
</P>

<BR>

<H4>R</H4>

<P ID="main">
The R rating denotes quotes which have moderate to slightly explicit sexual
content and/or &quot;Carlin word&quot; swearing (fuck, shit, etc).  Some
people are offended by this sort of thing, but they're asshats.
</P>

<BR>

<H4>X</H4>

<P ID="main">
X denotes quotes with very extreme sexual content.  Facials, bukkake,
felching, teabagging, and so forth, are things you might find mentioned, or
even described in explicit detail in these quotes.  They will, however, be
funny.  That's why someone posted them.
</P>

<BR>

<H4>B</H4>

<P ID="main">
This is reserved for quotes with highly Blasphemous content, and is mostly
reserved for quotes from the one-and-only Kardin and yours truly (Sevok). 
These quotes generate the most flaming, oddly. ;p
