<H3>Character Creation</H3>

<P>
This  is perhaps the most important part of your characters life, as the values you choose here cannot be altered with the exception of statistic boosting items. Throughout this guide I will assume you are playing the Dark Elf race (hence the title). For the Dark Elf I recommend adding 20 points to Intelligence and 10 to Agility. This will give you a good amount of mana, the agility is a lifesaver at low levels as you will get hit much less often. After spending your statistic points you will look something like this: 60 STR, 75 STA, 100 AGI, 75 DEX, 83 WIS, 129 INT, and 60 CHA. Your next choice will be which deity to follow. Unlike statistics you will never be able to change who you follow. As a Dark Elf Magician you are only given two choices: Innoruk or Agnostic. Selecting Innoruk will lead to you being accepted everywhere in Neriak (this is somewhat important, because when you turn in your guild note your faction with The Dead [Neriak Necromancer's Guild] will drop). However, following Innoruk will lead to 
guards in many of the good-aligned cities to murder you on religious background. Agnostic is probably the better choice here, you will have some chance of surviving in good-aligned cities long enough to do some faction boosting quests. Your last choice will be starting location; I won't humiliate you by analyzing the wide variety of choices.
</P>

<H3>Finding Your Guild</H3>

<P>
Neriak  can be a very confusing city for the brand new player. When you begin your life you will start out in front of the Dashing Form tailor shop. To your side will be a small tunnel, enter it and follow the ramp up to your right. Not too hard, you're now in the casters guild of Neriak. Inside is the guild master for the Enchanter, Wizard, and of course, Magician guilds. You will notice two stairways; the one on your right leads up to the top floor and additional Enchanter vendors. You want to go down the stairway to the left, go straight forward through the right door. Inside you will find 3 guild leaders and a few spell vendors. Your guild note will tell you which NPC to give the note to. After turning in the note you'll receive your guild tunic and a small amount of experience. You will also have 5 practice points, I recommend investing all 5 into Piercing. After memorizing your first two spells (one will be a form of direct damage spell and the other a shielding type) head out to the Foreign Quarter. If your not familiar with Neriak, see if you can get someone to lead you.
</P>

<H3>Level 1-4</H3>

<P>
While many Dark  Elves stay in Nektulos Forest in their early days, this is a very bad choice. Not enough monsters spread out over too much space. Instead, you will want to head out to East Freeport. Getting there from the entrance to Neriak is pretty straightforward. When you step out of the tunnel coming from Neriak run straight forward until you find a road. Turn to your left and follow the road straight; do not take any of the side paths (you will run across two). After awhile you will come across a bridge, while it's tempting to raise your swimming skill a bit, I wouldn't jump into the river unless you feel inclined to feed the piranha. After crossing the bridge continue straight (only 1 side turn this time, ignore it) until you run into a green chasm, continue inside and you'll zone into East Commons. To make the trip quick, follow the zone wall to the left and you'll soon find yourself in East Freeport! Before you begin hunting, approach the gate leading into Freeport and consider one of the guards, if they con dubiously your safe. Anything worse than that and you'll be making a quick sprint for the zone. Fighting at this level is pretty simple, cast your level 1 direct damage spell (most likely Burst of Flame) on your target and melee it to death, learn to cast in between enemy attacks to add extra damage. At level one most everything will con white to you, at this level I suggest going after rats and snakes, if you hunt at nighttime you should also seek bats and decaying skeletons. Fighting these creatures will get you to level 3 fairly 
quickly. At this level you can begin hunting deathfist pawns, these are not 
only good for experience but they drop some minor coin and cloth armor (which 
you will probably be wearing well into your teens). Soon enough you'll hear 
the lovely &quot;DING!&quot; of a new level up, this one you will be especially glad 
for because you can now buy your level 4 spells!
</P>

<H3>Level 5-8</H3>

<P>
Congradulations!  You now are able to buy your first set of pet summoning spells. When you reach level 4 I recommend you buy the following spells immediately (in this order): Elementalkin: of your choice, Burn, and Gate. At this point you should have also purchased the Summon Dagger, Drink, Food, and Bandages spells (these will let you extend your time away from towns out hunting much longer than other classes). Regarding elementals, it is your choice as to which line to buy; but it is foolish to buy all 4 unless you can truly afford them. Air Elementals have a high agility and tend to get hit less, plus they cast invisibility on themselves. Earth Elementals have very high hit points and good damage dealing capability, they also cast a root spell; they suffer in the areas of agility and armor class, though. Fire Elementals have almost no defensive capability but do the most damage in the shortest period of time; they also have a permanent fire shield cast on them. Water Elementals are the well-rounded ones, having moderate hit points, agility, armor class, and damage dealing; they can cast an ice-based direct damage spell and are immune to poison of all strengths. At level 5 to 8 you will want to return to Nektulos forest. Follow my directions for getting to the East Commons zone but do not cross the line, turn around and go to your right. You'll come across a  pretty large obelisk that will probably have a few people sitting around it. Here you will find skeletons, zombies, and lesser mummies spawn. At level 5 you will probably want to group with just one other person until you reach level 6 (which will come surprisingly quickly). After this level you can take skeletons on your own, but be cautious about taking more than one at a time. And until you get to level 7 don't even think about touching zombies or mummies! While the loot here is 
mediocre (minor coin, occasional cloth armor, & bone chips) the experience is 
terrific until you reach level 8 at which point it slows down drastically.
</P>

<P>
When you reach level 8 you are  once again ready to buy new spells. Right now 
you should purchase only what you need, as the level 12 ones will be pretty 
expensive (and considerably more powerful). You should buy these first: 
Elementaling: of your choice, Shock Of Blades, Lesser Shielding, 
Invisibility. Elementaling is obviously an upgrade to your pet, you will 
quite quickly notice the difference. Shock Of Blades is a Conjuration direct 
damage spell that does 31 to 40 damage. While you get Flame Bolt at this 
level, I advise against buying it; even if it does more damage, you must aim 
it and be on level ground to get a hit off. Invisibility is obvious, it 
renders you invisible to players and (almost) any non-undead NPC will regard 
you indifferently. This is very useful when traveling through hostile areas, 
but be careful! The duration is totally random.
</P>


<H3>Level 8-12</H3>

<P>
You are now considerably  more powerful, and you can now head over to East Commons to fight some more difficult creatures. At level 8 you can handle white, yellow, and even low red creatures if you are cautious. The basic tactic is to use a direct damage spell against your target, send your pet in, sit down to meditate, and pepper the creature with more DD spells if necessary. Remember: Your first priority is keeping your pet alive. If it dies, you will soon follow. Around this level I suggest you hunt asps and darkweed snakes. If you decide to do this you should use the water pet, as they are immune to its poison. Both asps and darkweed snakes will drop Giant Snake Fangs; these are fairly good piercing weapons for both you and your pet, they also sell for a solid 3 gold and change. Hunting these will get you well into level 10 and even level 11 if you work at it. At level 11 you'll find most creatures you've been fighting are now blue and don't give as much experience as you'd like. At this point you can either head over to Northern Ro to fight dervishes and wandering desert tarantulas or you can hunt wisps in East Commons. I personally have chosen to fight wisps, because they will pretty often drop lightstones and greater lightstones. &quot;But why would a Dark Elf need a light source?&quot; Well, they don't; but lightstones sell pretty well to vendors (7g-1pp each, depending on faction and charisma) and greater lightstones can sell for as much as 10pp to other players. Why go for good loot and low experience gain? Because you will you be finding yourself doing this more and more as you progress in levels. Plus your level 12 spells will be costing you 6pp each and the extra platinum certainly isn't going to hurt.
</P>

<P>
Once you reach level 12 you should  (as always, maybe you noticed the pattern) buy your spells!  You'll want to purchase these spells: Summon Elemental: of your choice, Bind Affinity, Burnout,  Ward Summoned, and Cancel Magic. Summon Elemental is the upgrade to your pet line. Bind Affinity will set your bind point (and can be casted on anyone in your party), this is where you will return after dying or gating. While casters can bind themselves anywhere, they can only bind others in zones that contain towns. Burnout is a pet-only buff that will greatly increase its ability in combat, you'll always want to have this on your pet when fighting. Ward Summoned does 41 damage to summoned creatures, very useful in Lavastorm or anywhere you fight summoned creatures. Cancel Magic will remove the last buff spell cast on the target, this is extremely useful when taking the fire shield from hostile Fire Elementals down, or removing that Root spell from yourself.
</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>
That's all for now. I'll  be adding to this guide as I continue on with my own Magician. While I didn't include it in this version, I'll be adding some basic to advanced fighting tactics for using our pets to their fullest potential. Hoped this guide helped some aspiring Magician ; ) Last Updated 2.10.00
