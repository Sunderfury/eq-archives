		November 29th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>*Patch Day*<p>Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay issues:<p>- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum.  Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction.<p>- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player character rather than an NPC.  The change last patch reduced them to a rate below player characters.  As part of this patch, target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the intended type.  For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything.  <p>- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few minutes.  For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this should address the issue.<p>- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards.  Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it.  <p>- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting to get back in.<p>- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping is enabled.  Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is adopted.<p>- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace".  This means that you can now assign "Backspace" to a function in game.<p>- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances.  There is still a potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near future.<p>- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while.<p>- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons.  The calculation used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability.  It is possible that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet that will not have this ability. <p>- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant.  Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune.<p>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill.<p>Remember! Only a few days left until the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious.  Reserve your copy at your local retailer today!<p><br>- The EverQuest Team<p>

		November 21st, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>*Patch Day*<p>Today's patch addresses a few problems noted by customers since last week's big patch.  The following changes were made:<p>- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum or below the minimum.<br>- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br>- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified whenever the volume slider was moved.<br>- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association with mipmapping.<br>- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the wrong slot.<br>- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those carried by dwarves. <br>- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of experience in slight disagreement with the server.<br>- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that would do around one million points of damage if left to its own devices.<br>- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable.  <p>In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up following the patch today.  Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god of fortune.  We would have named the new server under its full name if not for an attempt to avoid confusion between the existing "Bristlebane" server (named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<p>- The EverQuest Team

		November 15th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>***Patch Day***<p>Today's patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology included with DirectX 7.  You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play EverQuest.  Please refer to http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml prior to contacting technical support for procedures prior to contacting technical support.<p>Today's patch also includes the new "Sound Engine" that we've been speaking about for some time.  The new sound engine supports additional EAX features and should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted in the past.<p>*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*<p>The /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday 11/18 and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-8) to Midnight.  All players wishing to have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) from those servers to the new split-server should execute "/movelog yes" during the windows.<p>The physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for a firm time when it is decided.  Remember that corpses will not follow you to the new server, so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all corpses are looted prior to the time of the actual move.  <p>As this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people being left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention after the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during the window.  You will need to be present and execute the command in order to move.<p>*Spell Changes*<p>-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist.<br>-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing the secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day.<br>-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item.  The effect was checking resist on each tick instead of running full course.<br>-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item.<br>-- Fixed the "Modulating Rod" so that it can be used by the appropriate races.<br>-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned<br>-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength spell.<br>-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack appropriately with other spells that have similar effects.<p>-- Modified the "Jonathan's" line of songs to remove the "skin" effect in order to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat.  In addition, we made them "Self Only" spells rather than "Single Target" spells in order to allow bards to remain in combat while singing them.<p>*General Fixes/Changes*<p>-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on "Sister's Isle" to attack people who were fighting pirates.<br>-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game since they do not have the piercing skill.<br>-- The "Belt of the River" quest should now work correctly.<br>-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.<br>-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.<br>-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items.  Please check your items to see your changes.  Note:  Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item.<br>-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the correct loot.<br>-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.<br>-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.<br>-- Made the "Gravebinder" a magic weapon.<p>-- Repaired the Forager Bag.  It was causing people to lose weight when placing items in the bag.  It is supposed to have a weight reduction component, but was not supposed to cause weight loss.<p>-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50.  Previously, creatures above level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill.  Now, most creatures below the character's level can now be successfully taunted.  As a note, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller than that of a creature below 50th.<p><br>*Client Enhancements*<p>-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.<br>-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the total number of available socials by 108.<br>-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to translate incorrectly.<br>-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at higher resolutions.<br>-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<p>-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider.  Users should now see differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones that support an adjustable clipping plane.<p>-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show "[LD]" over their heads when linkdead.  In addition, these same players will no longer show as "LinkDead" in the /who list.<p>-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game.  /usercolor:  Usage "/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B" where "UserColorNumber is the number of the color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are red, green and blue respectively.  All changes will be automatically saved to your EQCLIENT.INI file.<p>-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the character name indicating the server number.  As such, you will now be able to have characters of the same name on two separate servers with different custom options.<p>-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number and character name.  For instance, if your character is named "Bobb", and you are on Server 1, your log text file name would be eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.<p>-- Added two new entries to the "Defaults" section of the EQCLIENT.INI file:  AttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack turns on automatically when assisting.  Defaults to "TRUE".  ShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not you see the "Soandso is inspecting you" message.  Defaults to "TRUE".<p>-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced.  You can now set two keys, a primary and an alternate, for each function in game.  In addition, things that were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your preference.  Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key, right-click to set the secondary.<p>-- Added the /note command.  /note will append the following text to a file called "notes.txt" in your EverQuest directory.  For instance, typing "/note This is a note" will put "This is a note" on the next line in the notes.txt file.<p><br>- The EverQuest Team<p>

		September 28th, 7:00am<br>------------------------------<p>***Patch Day***<p>The following changes have been implemented on the production servers as part of today's patch:<p>*General Changes*<p>- NPC corpses level 55 or over will now last 30 minutes before decaying.  This should help those on large multi-group encounters who need some prep-time before looting items.<br>- The item "Woe" has been repaired.  If you receive the "Item out of charges" message when your "Woe" attempts to fire its spell, please contact a GM to trade out the item.<br>- The spell "Mark of Karn" has been changed.  The recast-time has been reduced significantly and the Hitpoint-return is now scaled inversely based upon the delay of the weapon.  In addition, a hitpoint return will only take place when the target is hit with a primary melee weapon, or the primary hand if you are unarmed.<br>- Some more tradeskill component vendors have been placed within the world to make certain tradeskills easier to use in your home town.<br>- "AFK" and "LD" status will now be reported above player's heads.<p>*Fleeing NPCs*<p>Last week's patch caused NPCs to flee more than before due to a bug that was fixed.  After evaluating the situation, we decided to reduce the chance to flee, but not to the extent that it was reduced before.  NPCs were previously much more "brave" than they should have been.<p>As part of the same change, charmed NPCs also began fleeing when low on health.  We've determined that this is not a good situation for the players.  As such, we have stopped charmed creatures from fleeing per player request.<p>*Level 1 Character Purge*<p>The Level 1 character purge has been completed.  All level 1 characters that have not been played within the past 30 days have been deleted.<p>*New Server Active*<p>Tholuxe Paells, a new server open to new characters only, is now active and ready for play.  Enjoy!  As a reminder, /movelog registration will take place on Mithaniel Marr and Tunare Friday evening from 6PM to Midnight (PDT: GMT-7).  Registered characters will be moved to a second new server, Drinal, early next week.<p>***User Interface Changes***<p>Many UI enhancements were made in today's patch:<p>*Moving and Resizing Windows*<p>The data windows in the full screen "HUD" mode may now be moved by clicking in the upper left-hand corner, moving them to where you want, then clicking again.  The "spell effect" and "chat" windows can be resized by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging to the appropriate size, and then clicking again.  Coordinates for window locations in each resolution are stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<p>*Bugs with Several Commands Fixed*<p>We fixed a problem with /book, /sit, and /doability that allowed them to be executed at inappropriate times, such as while charmed or feared.  They should now only function when the native button would have functioned if pressed.<p>*Miscellaneous Additions*<p>Added the following /-commands:<p>- /camp: Causes your character to camp out.  You must be sitting to use /camp.<br>- /disband: Will disband you from your current group, or turn down an invitation to join another group.<br>- /invite:  Will invite the target into a group, or accept an invitation if one is pending.<br>- /attack: Will toggle the state of "Auto-attack".  You may also add a parameter of "on" or "off" to explicitly set the state.<p>In addition:<p>- CTRL-1 through CTRL-8 will cast the spell in the specified spell-slot.<br>- ":" (colon: Short for /emote) and "'" (apostrophe: Short for /say) will now bring up the chat line in the same fashion as the /-key and ENTER.<br>- The "R" key (by default) takes you into reply-mode as always, bringing up a reply to the last person sending you a /tell.  However, you can now TAB and SHIFT-TAB to cycle through the last 10 people that have sent you /tells. <p>*Pauses in Socials*<p>You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).  <p>For example, a social consisting of:<p>/sit off<br>/cast 1<br>/pause 100<br>/sit on<p>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<p>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.<p>For example:<p>/sit off<br>/pause 100,/cast 1<br>/sit on<p>...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line.  <p>*Emote Codes*<p>The @ symbol has been replaced with a series of %-codes that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in ALL chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild). <p>The new %-codes are: <p>%T - Returns the current target.<br>%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).<br>%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).<br>%P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).<br>%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).<p>For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote:<p>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O.<p>...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it."<p>- The EverQuest Team<br>
