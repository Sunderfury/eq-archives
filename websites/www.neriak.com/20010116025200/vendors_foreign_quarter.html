<P>
Lighter races have been given full rein in this quarter to have their own businesses set up.  *sneers*  I will try not to pass too many of my feelings on this decision made by the Council and will concentrate instead on telling you what is sold here.
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Those vendors that are labelled as selling 'Adventurers Supplies' typically sell rations, bandages, water and other general supplies you may need on your travels.  Those labelled Bartenders generally have every kind of drink available in town, as well as usually selling empty bottles and casks for your own brewing ventures.
</P>
