</FONT><HR>How many people do you see truley roleplay?  Not many can nor want to simply because they will be lonely for their EQ life.  Depending on your class, to get some real experience in the higher levels, you MUST join a group.  If you don't watch your groups back, you will never find a group.  If you are roleplaying and refuse to speak to any race or anyone for that matter because you hate them... then unless your a wizard, you will be spending most of your EQ life walking to the zones you need to at your normal walking rate.<P>The game might as well be single player and not play online.  The reason Everquest is so successful is the online capabilities and comraderie. (forgive me if it is spelled wrong)  I vastly enjoy grouping with friends and if they were all dark elves, then that would be fantastic.  My roleplaying comes when i begin to kill the guards and merchants i see wandering around.  My ultimate goal is to be in a high level guild that has the number and caliber to really destroy cities.  That won't happen for a while if it ever does, but we can always hope.<P>Most of what you said makes sense and is true... i hope my statement helps you to understand why roleplaying isn't very popular for us dark elves.<P>Irba Ghez'unan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.28.78.164</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>There's is an ongoing debate about the logistics of how the Teir'Dal worship their patron deity.  Some argue as Winnd does, saying that it becomes a cutthroat backstabbing society inwhich the strongest survive through a torrent of constant political chaos.  The second theory is the one I prefer and, indeed, is the one that I roleplay on the Rallos Zek server.<P>The idea is that the Teir'Dal are a fierce caste society.  Every Dark Elf knows his or her place within the whole of society, much like a colony of ants.  Depending on class, individuals are met out with roles to which they adhere.  They may become the best of their class, but they will never truly be able to challenge the next heighest tier in Dark Elf society.  This formed a debate amongst the players about which caste was most dominant.  Immediatly, the following were discarded:  The 'Outcast' mages, namely anything but the Necromancers.  So too were the Rogue Assassins and Warrior Guards of Indigo Brotherhood discarded.  This left Shadow Knights, Necromancers and Clerics.  Clerics seemed ill suited according to the masses, speaking the word and providing advisory to those in power.  It took little exploring through Neriak to reveal that the real power behind the throne existed in the Shadow Knights as the palace honour guard and the Necromancers as the object focussed power of darkness.  No other race truly welcomes and seeks the dark powers of necomancy like the Teir'Dal.  In all other societies, they're outcasts.  Not so here.  They're leaders.<P>So a fierce loyalty begins to devellope with this cast system.  Each relies upon the other because simply, it's the Teir'Dal against the world.  Yes, the Ogres and Trolls are their allies, but how far can they be relied upon?  Some conversions have been made among the ranks of Trolls and Ogres, swaying them to the side of Innoruuk, but not all.  Out of a common goal to ruin the world and shape it for themselves as their Father, Innoruuk, shaped the Elvin King and Queen, the Dark Elves must band together.<P>Do marriages happen?  Perhaps.  Treaties, favours, and yes, even undying loyalty can form lasting partnerships.  By our standards, it probably might even seem like love.  Honour, devotion, even a trust could be observed.  Children born of such unions might have the advantage of class depending on parentage.  The son of a Priestess and Necomancer might indeed enjoy a fullfilled life in either role, as their Lords dictate.<P>Roleplaying isn't about finding out what *can't* happen and what *shouldn't* happen.  It's about exploring possibilities and making discoveries.  Shutting down ideas is the wrong way to go.  Flesh out those first inspirations and see where they take you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.112.88.229</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

(btw i'm lev 47) Evil does not have to be alone... you just have to be smarter than the rest. if you need something.. use somebody else to get it.<BR>I have some GREAT allies.. who would back me up on any fight. be it Nagafen. or one of the gods themselves. they just think I am something else. roleplaying evil gives you rights to lie.. or so i think. but my character has been 'round since the dawn of Norrath. and will always be evil. and will ALWAYS have allies. good an evil alike.<BR>laterz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 203.101.49.43</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>I do not believe that generally societies who are terribly hated by others or opressed eventually go to a caste society *or* to infighing and hatred of themselves.<P>The Teir`dal - as I see them - are in the position to take back what they have lost.  They have lost lands to the humans and are trying to negotiate a treaty (Ambassador DVinn) that will give them a foothold for taking over the continent of Fayd.<P>Infighting and backstabbing does *not* mesh in well with this plan to drive the other races from their lands - since the smartest war strategist knows that you must stand together in spirit and intent (not divided) to make and go through with plans of war.<P>I personally do not see the caste system working for the Teir`dal for the same reason - it causes divisiveness.  I do see in Neriak, though, that apparantly the guilds that go from the Foreign Quarter on into the 3rd Gate go from least honored to most honored.  I feel that warriors (as seen in society, heavens I surely don't mean to give my friends who play warriors any reasons to frown!) are seen mostly as failed shadowknights and that the Indigo Brotherhood is tolerated for defense, but somewhat the town joke.  Especially seeing as how most of them are so weak!<P>The Third Gate houses the guilds that are the most honored and the most close to Innoruuk and the King and Queen.<P>All in my own opinion,<P>Zariu Qu`el`velguk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.78.66.223</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

</FONT><HR>I play my Teir'Dal cleric somewhat similarly to how Morbid_Knight plays. Djalai doesn't shun lesser races. Instead, she demonstrates an openess that would be uncommon among the Teir'Dal... She recognizes that the light races have their strengths and unique skills that simply aren't available to dark elves, and she has seen that associating with commonbloods, thereby gaining their trust, could very well be an effective way of strengthening and furthering her Dark Elven brethren.<P>Hm... That didn't contribute a thing to the conversation.  <IMG SRC="http://www.neriak.com/ubb/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 209.186.240.14</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>Evil is merely a convenient label the self-described good races use to justify their prejudices. They call us evil for using powers they fail to comprehend yet kill each other over petty material possessions. The few who will open their minds to the ture path are my allies; the rest must be subjugated or killed so they can no longer spread their hypocrisy and threaten our way of life.<P>Why should I fight my brothers and sisters who walk the same path? Then I would be no better than those who seek to destroy us. Why should I not provide any aid possible to those who follow Innoruuk's will? To do less diminishes our cause and weakens us all. <P>Those who would sow dissention in our own ranks are traitors to everything we stand for, a cancer that must be cut out before they contaminate others with their deceitful ways. One only has to observe the other races to see how such a disease can corrupt an entire society if not dealt with swiftly.<P>To try to define my character with a single word is the epitome of foolishness. Am I not a doting husband and loving father? Do I not provide my family every advantage so my children will grow strong and wise? Will I employ any means necessary to ensure our way of life? Yes. If one calls that evil, so be it. <P>Chazmyrr<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 4.54.49.155</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

These are a people that are hatred personified.  They were molded, shaped, and created by the god of hate.  They don't love, they don't care, they don't protect each others back.  They don't get married.</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This is precisely the view of "evil" that I do not agree with.<P>I view evil as a label used by the uninformed, ill-informed, and jealous outsiders to justify their hatred of us and make it possible for them to slay us without remorse.<P>"Good" and "evil" are simply labels used by two sides of a coin to describe those different from each other.  Nothing more, nothing less.<P>Do we hate each other?  NO!  Why should we?  Unless we have REASON to hate an INDIVIDUAL for what they've done to us, we want to HELP our fellow Teir'dal so that our race can grow stronger and stronger and one day finally rule Norrath.<P>Innoruuk is the Prince of Hate, yes, and he gives us the FREE WILL to hate those who deserve it, rather than requiring us to love everyone and everything without reason or explanation.  Innoruuk represents the freedom to hate, to kill, to be power hungry and seek power, wealth, and whatever we desire.  <P><P>------------------<BR>Sevok Celith'ar<BR>Teir'dal Necromancer<BR>Darkmoon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.78.66.223</font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000003&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000003&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
