A Law Unto Himself
</P>

<P>
I think you'll enjoy this wine, my dear.  Granted, all the To`Biath merlots 
are quite good, but this is a particularly excellent vintage. What? You wish 
to hear my story?  Whyever not?  Our target will not arrive for some time 
yet, and it will surely pass the time...
</P>

<P>
The beginning is somewhat difficult, as the details of my birth are, alas, 
rather unknown to me.  What can actually be recorded of my origins begin 
instead shortly after my birth.  You see, I was found in a basket by a group 
of gypsies near their kumpania in the Nektulos Forest.  T`was they who raised 
an abandoned babe as one of their one, and who dedicated my soul to 
Bristlebane, the Lord of Cunning.  
</P>

<P>
How can I possibly describe the wonder of my early years?  My loving 
foster-family was a part of a travelling circus.  I dare say I learned to 
tumble well before I learned how to walk!  Moreover, I proved to be an eager 
and talented student of the mysterious (and often extralegal) traditions of 
my regal foster-family as well.  Regal?  My dear, are you not aware that all 
gypsies are princes and princesses?  They are the Free People, living outside 
Society, unfettered by its rules.  They recognize no law but that of the Road 
and the laws of the Road basically all come to the simple truth that there are
no laws ... and no sins except for failure.  Therefore, every gypsy is a 
Prince, as every gypsy is the absolute master of his own Life, and governs it 
accordingly.  A provocative philosphy, is it not?  
</P>

<P>
But I am digressing, I fear.  In the warmth of the kumpania, I grew swiftly 
and surely.  By my tenth winter, I had become their star acrobat and a fairly 
rising talent in their various games of confidence.  The mental and physical 
superiority that was mine as Teir`Dal set me well apart from my foster 
siblings:  I was nimbleness itself, able to all but fly though the air.  I 
could become as part of the shadows themselves, juggle daggers blindfolded, 
part fools from their bulging purses with ease, and charm wine from the teats 
of a goat.  I must confess, I revelled in my abilities.  
</P>

<P>
Eventually, the idyll of my childhood gave way to the siren call of the Dark 
City.  I was but thirteen winters when I decided to leave.  It was with a 
genuine sadness that I left my merry foster-family and set forth on to 
Neriak, and I am not ashamed to admit to tears.  Are you surprised?  Even 
outraged?  Recall that I was raised with the blessings of the Master of 
Guile, not Father Innoruuk.  As Teir`Dal, hate is my privilege ... but it is 
not my master.  Come to think of it, my dear, no one is.  In any event, as 
The Prince of Hate despises even his own children (even those who dedicate 
themselves body and soul to Him), I doubt very much that my heresy will 
endear me less to Him.  Besides, Mischief is so very much more fun, not to 
mention profitable.  In sum, I was loath to leave, but neither Destiny nor 
Blood can be denied.  Or so sing the Bards in their lays.
</P>

<P>
Neriak.  Sweet Neriak.
</P>

<P>
Forgive me my sigh, but I can still recall with perfect clarity how my 
youthful pulse raced when I first stepped beyond its mighty gates.  The 
sublime beauty of the Dark City filled my heart to almost overflowing.  Eh?  
How could a gypsy-bred ragamuffin like myself at that time survive in Neriak? 
You jest, surely.  Survival was not difficult.  The gypsies had taught their 
fledgling well enough to ensure that my nimble fingers could secure food, 
drink, and the occasional garment when needed.  The rooftops were my allies 
in avoiding guards and in providing safe shelter during the night.  It is a 
basic thing to be noted that sentient beings rarely look up.  Remember that 
in future.  
</P>

<P>
I also soon discovered that my lean good looks and gift for storytelling were 
most welcome at the Maiden's Fancy: Patrons favored me with a silver or two 
for feats of juggling or a good story as they waited to sample the lithe 
treasures of the House.  As for the ladies themselves, well ... I often 
obtained a good meal and a warm bed there from them.  Sometimes even company 
for the night.  I have the Fancy to thank for the beginning of my education 
of women (a scholarship I still fervently pursue to this day), and for my 
present profession (which I pursue with at least equal enthusiasm).  Who 
would have suspected that they would have been so closely connected that one 
night?  The Twists of  Bristlebane are many, dear lady, and cannot be 
fathomed ... merely enjoyed.  Merely enjoyed.
</P>

<P>
That fateful night, a powerful noble was spending the evening at the Fancy, 
one who had made powerful enemies.  All that I knew of him was that he wore a 
bracelet with the largest gemstones I had ever seen.  A single jewel from it 
would have provided me with sustenance for a quarter of a year.  So, at the 
Hour of the Wolf, I left my companion to her rest and padded down the hall, 
with larceny in mind.  A wire in the lock and oil on the hinges led to my 
silent entry and to the shock of my life: A hooded figure looming over the 
noble's body, a bloody dagger in his hand ... staring straight at my highly 
unexpected and quite unwelcome presence.
</P>

<P>
Slamming the door shut, I tore through the Fancy, exiting headfirst out of a 
window and into the streets (Mischief bless my tumbling skills!).  T`was here 
that my vaunted speed and my knowledge of the City were to be tested to the 
fullest measure, as I knew that the assassin would not let a thread such as I 
remain loose.  Oh, my dear, but it was an epic chase!  Bards would sing of it 
had they seen it.  All through the night we raced, through streets, sewers, 
and alleyways ... bounding over rooftops, awnings and balconies.  All the 
while I dodged vicious knives and shuriken hurled by my opponent until he had 
exhausted his supply.  I tried everything I knew (and could make up on the 
spot), but nothing I did shook him off.  My spirits began to ebb, even as the 
pounding of my heart was such that I feared it would burst asunder and rob my 
assailant of the prize of ending my life himself.  Then, like a miracle, I 
saw it.  The opportunity I needed.  Praying that my pursuer (who was at this 
point so close behind I could all but feel his heated breath upon my back) 
would be so intent upon seizing me that he would not realize my scheme, I did 
the last thing he expected: I stopped short, ducked and whirled to face him.  
Grasping my pursuer by the legs as he slammed into me, I rose, and let his 
momentum send him hurtling helplessly into a burly pair of City Guards who were idling by a corner.  As they lay writhing and cursing in a pile, I disappeared into what remained of the 
night, my very soul listening to the enthusiastic, divine applause of my 
beloved patron, the King of Thieves.  
</P>

<P>
The next few weeks were indeed tense, my lovely one.  I was living miserably 
in the Foreign Quarter, amid the Trolls and the Ogres and the Mon-Kie (Your 
pardon.  I believe that they call themselves Humans.  A new race, rather 
unsophisticated, but versatile and not unlovely, in their own way).  So.  
With grime on my features, rags on my back, and an artful twisting of my 
body, I wandered about the Quarter, confident that few would bother to notice 
yet another poor cripple in the area.  There was no future for me.  A bounty 
was surely on my head, and I could rely on no one now in Neriak.  Leaving was 
also impossible.  The gypsies had long ago moved on and the forest was, of 
course, too dangerous to be traversed by a solitary, unarmed youth.  Wracking 
my brains at this, the nadir of my life, I suddenly felt the cruel edge of a 
knife at my throat, and a whispered voice say, &quot;I could kill you here and 
now, but that would be a waste beyond measure.&quot;  The knife vanished, and I 
looked up to the hooded figure I thought I had escaped.  My astonishment 
doubled as he laughed loud and long.  &quot;Bristlebane's ballocks, boy!&quot; He 
roared.  &quot;A finer chase I've never had in all of my years.  You would have 
escaped me sure if you'd have left Neriak as late as even two days ago.  Why 
did you stay?&quot;  The look on my face and my silence were  answer enough.  
&quot;Nowhere to go, eh?&quot;  He asked quietly.  &quot;Perhaps we can find you a home 
worthy of your talents.  Come.&quot;  And such was my introduction to the great 
Hekzin G`Zule,  he who would become my mentor, teach me all I know of 
refinement, and bring me to the bosom of the Ebon Mask and my life as a 
Rogue... a perfect profession for one who was, after all, raised a Prince of 
his own Fate.
</P>

<P>
What happened thereafter can wait for another night.  See, our target has 
arrived, and with a hulking friend in tow.  Foolish man, as if a bodyguard 
will safeguard him from our questing fingers.  You'll tend to his large 
companion?  Most kind.  Now follow my lead and we'll have both the artifact 
and the opportunity to drink another bottle of  this most excellent wine 
before daybreak.  Ready?  Let's go.
</P>

<P>
My way is Shadow; My ally, Silence; My virtue, Surprise.<BR>
My creed? If you can't be Good, be Elegant.
