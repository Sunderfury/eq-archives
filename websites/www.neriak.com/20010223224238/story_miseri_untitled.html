<P>
The mist shrouded trees stretching their arms to the heavens came alive with the morning sun.  Tiny songbirds in their infinite hues flitted about the branches and chirped at the two Teir'Dal walking briskly below.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Don't those things ever shut up?&quot; Almasy muttered, dodging a log on the path. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;I rather like them,&quot; Miserikordi said.  &quot;At least it's birds and not wolves out and about.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;No,&quot; he spat, &quot;those don't come out until sunset, from what I've heard.  Damn these things for being so talkative!  I'd much rather it be wolves, or even bears.  Neither of the two chirp.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Miserikordi laughed, wrinkling her nose.  &quot;You're bound and determined to complain about everything beforehand on this journey, aren't you?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;No, I'm really not,&quot; Almasy answered.  He took care in leading Miserikordi away from another treebranch in her way.  &quot;I only hate things that make it IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK!!&quot; 
</P>

<P>
As if by some magick, the treetops fell silent.
</P>

<P>
&quot;THANK you,&quot; Almasy shouted.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Wait, Almasy,&quot; she said in a hushed tone, putting her free hand on his shoulder.  &quot;Why did they stop?&quot;
</P>

<P>
He stopped, turning to face her, slightly confused by her worried expression.  &quot;Huh?  Oh, I don't know, but it's a whole lot easier to hear one another talk--&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Shh!  Listen....&quot;
</P>

<P>
A low rumble began, followed by a crash as something enormous began lumbering through the brush along the side of the path.  With a roar that seemed more out of curiosity than anger, the young kodiak padded out of the trees ahead on the path.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Oh, good, a bear. Just what I need,&quot; Almasy mumbled.  &quot;Like we learned about Tunare's followers in class.  First, they take the mind, then the bod--&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Be quiet!  It's probably is too busy to notice us.&quot;
</P>

<P>
A set of amber eyes locked onto Almasy, and the Teir'Dal automatically took a step back.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Umm, Miseri?  How fast can you run?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I don't kn--&quot;
</P>

<P>
There was a split second before six hundred pounds of bear began to charge, and in that moment, Almasy pushed Miserikordi into the ferns between the trees.  Another second was enough time for him to do a spin on his heel and stare into the kodiak's open maw.  He threw up his arm into the farthest reaches of the bear's mouth, confusing it when it tried to close it's jaws and nothing happened.  Almasy let out a scream, red trickling out of the side of the bear's mouth.  He began smashing his elbow into the bear's face, trying to get at it's eyes.  A clawed foot came up and swiped at his chest, tearing his flimsy cloth robes to shreds and leaving four neat stripes across his flesh.
</P>

<P>
Suddenly, the bear groaned, it's jaws slackening enough for Almasy to pull free.  He cradled his badly mangled arm with his good arm, grimacing in pain.  Looking up, he saw the figure of another Teir'Dal, and a shaft of bright steel that peirced the bear's hide.  As the young kodiak fell onto it's side, the Teir'Dal pried the sword from it's carcass.  Bedecked in polished silver armor, it was obvious to any who had grown up in Neriak that this was a Shadowknight. 
</P>

<P>
For a moment, the young Teir'Dal stared openly at the Shadowknight, working his mouth, trying to think of something to say.  The silence was broken only by the struggling Miserikordi, trying to find her way out of a tangle of vines.  Regainig some of his wits, Almasy went over to help tug her free and get her on her feet. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;You kids are far from the safety of our home,&quot; the Shadowknight rasped.  &quot;You're both quite lucky I hadn't already left for the Commons when I heard you scream, boy.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;T-thank you, s-sir,&quot; Almasy stuttered.  
</P>

<P>
From beneath his skull-shaped helm, the Shadowknight pulled his lips back over pointed teeth in a sneer.  &quot;You can thank me by returning to your mother's apron, boy, and not causing anyone else to slow down to help you!&quot;  He then tore the scabbard from his waist and threw it on the ground beside the dead kodiak.  &quot;There is all you need to get back.  Take it and make bloody sure I don't catch you two again!&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Y-yes sir, I will, sir,&quot; Almasy murmured, lowering his eyes.  Slowly, the chirping birds resumed their songs, adding insult to injury.
</P>

<P>
&quot;What an awful thing to say,&quot; Miserikordi said once she heard the Shadowknight clear the path ahead.  
</P>

<P>
Almasy looked from his crushed arm to the sword in its decorated scabbard at his feet.  &quot;He was right, though,&quot; he said at last.  &quot;I'm not meant to be outside like this.  Look at what I got us into, Miseri.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You aren't saying that you're agreeing with him, are you?  After the way you tried to face down that kodiak?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;No, I'm...well, maybe I am.  One thing's for sure, though.  I'll need to grow strong if I intend to go out and live to tell about it.&quot;  He let out a ragged breath of air, and swayed for a bit.  &quot;Oh, my.  Well, I might not have to worry about...surviving...till then....&quot;
</P>

<P>
She reached out to his arm, pulling back when she felt the slick coating it.  &quot;You're bleeding!  We have to go back.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;No, no, it's not that...bad...here, I'll tie it up now, and we can stop somewhere for the night.&quot;  Almasy took what little there was of his apprentice robe and tore it into strips as bandages.  He carelessly brushed the claw marks on his chest once or twice and winced.  Surprisingly, they weren't nearly as deep or as painful as they should have been.  &quot;Good as...ohh...well, practically new.  Hey, don't look like I'm already dead and buried, Miseri.  It's not helping me any.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said quickly.  &quot;It's just that this was my idea to begin with, and now look at you!  It's all my fault.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I would have come up here and done the same thing whether or not it was you who suggested it.  After all, I don't exactly have a home to return to.  Come on, let's get going before it gets too late in the day.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The path took several turns and dips as the area of the forest became more rugged, with little foothills and large standing boulders.  Jagged peaks, far from the forest, reflected a reddish glow and stood like giants brandishing weapons.  At the end of the path lay the mouth of a cavern, with no discernable end to its depths.  Heat came away from the opening in visible waves.  Neither fledgeling adventurer pushed following the path at that point, but decided to wander southwards, path or no. 
</P>

<P>
By midday, the sounds of water were heard, and they were soon at an impass.  A river, bubbling as it ran fast as quicksilver, blocked them further.  Thick clouds of mist spawned by the river clung to the ground and hovered in the air about them.  Another hour passed slowly, spent on trying to find a more suitable area to cross.  
</P>

<P>
Miserikordi suddenly stopped in her tracks, claiming to have heard singing.  &quot;And not just singing,&quot; she said, half-smiling, &quot;they're singing dirty songs, too.&quot;
</P>

<P>
With a skeptical look, Almasy drew the sword hanging loosely from his belt.  He followed behind her, emerging at last from the blanket of fog into a small open area.    
</P>

<P>
The singer rolled his eyes up to stare at them, his mouth hanging open.  He sat with his legs stretched; one shaky hand clutched the neck of a bottle, the other hand gripped a staff with a skull rammed onto the top. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Wusgn gnoinon?&quot;  he drawled, punctuating with a hiccup.
</P>

<P>
&quot;A drunkard singing dirty songs,&quot; Miserikordi chuckled.
</P>

<P>
&quot;What now?&quot;  the drunk mumbled, trying to get to his feet using the bottle and taking a swig from the staff.  He groaned when the staff struck his forehead.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Sir,&quot; Almasy began, taking a short bow, &quot;we're travelers looking to cross the river and leave the forest.  Would you happen to know the way?&quot;
</P>

<P>
After a moment to stare at the enchanter with a sword, the drunkard gave him a nod and a small hiccup.  Leaning on his staff, he rose to his feet, and pointed with the bottle across the river.  The mist swirled and cleared a path, revealing a hanging bridge.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; Almasy said, sheathing his sword.  &quot;Miseri, do you have anything we can give the man?&quot;
</P>

<P>
She reached into her bundle and brought out a loaf of bread and a bottle of milk.  &quot;This shouldn't give you a kick in the head like that brew, sir,&quot; she said.  With a smile, she set them at the drunkard's feet.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Mmmhh...mmmhh, thank you,&quot; the drunkard said, sitting down again, setting the bottle aside.  &quot;I haven't been sober for nigh on to...well, for a while.  Don't think I've eaten in that time, either.  Thank you, young lady.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;It's not much, but you're very welcome to it.&quot;
</P>

<P>
A brief grin, the kind that gets people locked up, passed the drunk elf's face, and his hand went into the pocket of his robes.  Instead of the bit of fluff or shiny coin Almasy expected to see, the drunkards hand held a cirlce of bones, strung one next to the other, side to side.  Just big enough to fit around someone's neck.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Here you are,&quot; he said.  &quot;A fair trade.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Miserikordi took the bone collar, running her hands over it lengthwise and inside.  She got a questioning look from the drunkard, who stared long and hard at her face.  Finally, she smiled and fastened it around her neck.  &quot;Thank you again.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Not much as far as jewelry,&quot; Almasy said.
</P>

<P>
&quot;It'll help her cast,&quot; the drunk muttered.  &quot;She's got a talent for it, eh?  Can feel it coming off of her like leaves in autumn.  She's just about good as me!&quot;  He went into a fit of laughter that made Almasy cringe.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Let's go,&quot; Almasy whispered to Miserikordi, taking her elbow and pulling her to the bridge.  &quot;Well, it was certainly nice talking to you, sir!&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Hahahahahahahahaha, goodbye, children!&quot; he laughed, waving the loaf of bread about in the air and bringing his staff up to his mouth.  Miserikordi snickered when the drunk screamed about splinters in the bread.
</P>

<P>
&quot;He'll get it figured out,&quot; Almasy laughed.
</P>

<P>
With the river past them, they followed the path with even more enthusiasm.  Almasy was fairly certain that the wall of mist would shield them from unwanted sight.  Still, he made sure they were moving through the flat expanse at a quick
pace, wary of any more kodiaks lurking about.
</P>

<P>
&quot;This isn't good,&quot; he said to himself, looking skywards.  The mist was tinged a golden red, a sure sign of sunset.  &quot;We need to find somewhere to stay the night,&quot; he said.  &quot;I don't want to risk getting caught in the open by a pack of wolves.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;There are some people over through there,&quot; Miserikordi offered, pointing to their right.  &quot;I can't tell who, but I know there's a good deal of sounds like dinner being made.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You're sure?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Well, a peek won't hurt us.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Letting Miserikordi lead, they took a worn way through a stand of trees, towards what looked like torchlights.
</P>

<P>
Almasy crouched beside a natural wall of logs, moving Miserikordi next to him, telling her to keep absolutely silent.  
</P>

<P>
She was right on about dinner being made; the smells of meat rosting wafted out through tiny brick chimneys and round windows.  Both stomachs began wailing to one another with false hopes of stew and cider.  Almasy wondered for a moment what their chances of stealing something were, but stopped when several burly Halflings sauntered out into the middle of town, swords strapped at their thick waists.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Well?&quot; Miserikordi asked.
</P>

<P>
&quot;It's nothing,&quot; he answered.  &quot;Just a lot of treehugging Halflings, that's all.  But, burn me, I'd risk getting run through for some of whatever that smell is.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she said.  &quot;It might not be so bad if you keep on your feet.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;No, I need something other than those awful muffins you've got packed.  Stay here, I'll just be a moment.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I don't like the sound of that,&quot; she said, frowning.
</P>

<P>
A pie of some sort lay on the windowsill of the nearest house, steaming and golden.  Almasy grinned as he crept up to it, hugging the side of the house, until he was directly beneath the window.  Balancing carefully on the balls of his feet, he slipped his hands under the pie and eased it away from the windowsill.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;See?  Nothing to it,&quot; he said to Miserikordi, holding the pie under her nose.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;And what have we here?  A little small for Teir'Dal,&quot; a distinctly Halfling voice said.
</P>

<P>
Almasy turned and just barely kept his heart from leaping out of his mouth.  
</P>

<P>
Five sparsely armored guards stood before them, thick arms folded across barrel chests, and scowling in unison.
</P>

<P>
To the side, an angry looking woman in her frilly pink apron glared at him.  She held out an open hand.
</P>

<P>
Sighing heavily, Almasy gave the little woman her pie, apologizing; something he never thought he'd do to a Halfling, but it seemed the right thing to do when there were multiple swords directed in his face.  &quot;I'm really very sorry,&quot; he explained.  &quot;My friend and I are both very tired and hungry, and I--&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Thought you'd just waltz on into my kitchen and take my best pie!&quot; the little woman finished.  &quot;The deputy ought to cut out your black heart, you thief!&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Now, I gave it back, apologized, even,&quot; Almasy said quickly.  &quot;What else do you want from me?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Just your life, you son of a gnoll,&quot; the deputy growled.  &quot;Companeeeeeee!!  Charge!!&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Oh, gods,&quot; Almasy breathed, grabbing Miserikordi's wrist and taking off through the trees.
</P>

<P>
She stumbled, but kept up with him, and said, &quot;What did I tell you, hmm?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;All right, all right, I'll listen next time,&quot; he yelled.  &quot;I'm sorry, you little creeps, just don't HURT US!!&quot;  An arrow whistled past his ear.  &quot;They've got arrows!&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;So I've noticed,&quot; she said, pulling a shaft out of the new hole in her apprentice robe.  The sounds of the chase were growing further and further away from them.  &quot;I think we've outrun them,&quot; she said.  
</P>

<P>
A howling cry went up from ahead, and another answered from behind.  One after another cried, until the forest wailed.  Black shapes darted out from between trees, their yellow eyes glowing in the sun's last light.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Keep running,&quot; Almasy called, &quot;we've almost made it to the pass out of Nektulos!&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I'm not sure I can outdistance wolves,&quot; she panted, her feet slowing to a stop.  &quot;I'm too tired, Almasy, I can't keep that up.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You'll have to if you want to leave this place alive,&quot; he said, tugging on her arm.  &quot;Now, move!&quot;
</P>

<P>
A wall of stone lay ahead, too tall by far for them to scale.  When they grew closer, the mists parted, and they could see a path cut into the living rock.  She ran behind him another hundred paces into the passage, and promptly collapsed.  Drawing his sword, Almasy took a defensive position in front of her, peering into the dark.  His mind's eye saw hundreds of shapes looming in the blackness, but he could see only one; the form of another person, standing against the wall across from them.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You're out a bit late, aren't you?&quot; the stranger chuckled.  &quot;What brings two baby Teir'Dal out here in the middle of the night?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Wolves,&quot; Almasy said, glancing at him.
</P>

<P>
He tapped a pipe off on his boot, then motioned with one arm as though drawing a sword.  &quot;Well, then, I can't have two visitors gettin' themselves killed so soon, can I?  Why don't you and your lady friend take off through the pass?  I can hold 'em here long enough for 'em to forget you.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Almasy sheathed his sword, and helped get Miserikordi to her feet.  She was barely concious, but she draped an arm arcoss his shoulders, and they limped along past the stranger.  The day had taken it's toll on him, as well; there were undoubtedly blisters forming on his feet, from the sting when he walked.  He looked across at her face, streaked with dirt, and noticed the tears cutting lines down her cheeks.  Hard as it was on him, the journey was already killing her.
</P>

<P>
On the other side of the pass, a small fire burned in a ring of stones.  Someone had a camp on the sloping sheet of stone, with a slab of meat on the spit over the fire.  Almasy didn't stop to wonder whose camp it was before setting Miserikordi on the ground, using his coat as a pillow for her head.    
</P>

<P>
A figure appeared in the firelight, wearing green and brown cloaks.  He smiled briefly at Almasy before tearing a leg off of the roast.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;A...Half Elf?&quot;  Almasy caught himself saying.  &quot;A ranger?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; the ranger said, mouth full of meat.  &quot;I was comin' back from the Halfling village when I heard the ruckus going on.  Lucky I was there.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Lucky, yeah.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Hey, don't sit there starin' at me like a fish, son,&quot; he laughed, &quot;have some.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Slowly, Almasy took a bit of flesh, and chewed on it.  &quot;It's good,&quot; he said.  &quot;You know what you're doing with those spices, huh?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You have to cook everything you eat when you're on the road,&quot; the ranger said.  &quot;Lion doesn't usually taste too wonderful on its own, so you have to soak it in beer.  You never answered me, though; what are you two doing all the way outside Neriak?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;On a journey,&quot; Almasy answered between mouthsful of food.  &quot;She's trying to find out why she was born.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Blind, is she?  Yeah, I thought so, by the way you were leadin' her around earlier on the bridge.  No, I wasn't stalkin' you, just curious.  Hey, whoah, hold on.  What's that from?  A wolf?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;A kodiak.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Got you a nice scar there, son.  Here, let me get you bandaged up nice.  Maybe get you and your friend new clothes, too, something more suited to travel.&quot;  He stood, taking the longbow off of his shoulder, and digging through a large hide pack on the ground.  He tossed Almasy a lightweight chain shirt, and a clean white shirt.  &quot;That'll help stop the smaller ones pokin' new holes in you.  You can wear it under the cloth one, so no one sees it.  I had a hard time wearing that chainmail in Freeport, what with all the stares from townsfolk.  And this is for her, when she comes to.&quot;  After tossing him another folded bundle, the ranger closed the pack and sat down near the fire again.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; Almasy said, the ranger taking his wounded arm in both hands.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Nah, don't mention it, just hold still a moment.&quot;  He unrolled a strip of cloth and began winding it around Almasy's arm.  &quot;There, all tied up, nice and pretty.  Here's some more bandages, you can finish your other wounds yourself.&quot;
</P>

<P>
After tying the last knot in the bandage around his chest, Almasy slipped the chainmail shirt on, followed by the cloth shirt.  He set the folded up robe next to Miserikordi, and stretched out on the rock next to the fire, watching the stars.
</P>

<P>
The ranger lit up his pipe again, gazing upwards at the night sky alive with twinkling points of light.  &quot;Y'know,&quot; he said softly, &quot;when I was a lad, my father used to listen to me whine about wantin' to go into the caves behind the waterfall with the other boys and play like we were druids and necromancers.  He told me I couldn't go with them, that I needed to take my bow out to the target range in back of the house and practice for the big day when I became a ranger.  Heh heh...I'll never forget him laughing at me when I insisted on being a druid like the rest of my friends, and sayin', we all have a role in life, and yours is to be a ranger.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;So...you let your father choose what you were to be when you got old enough?&quot; Almasy asked, raising a brow.
</P>

<P>
&quot;No, lad,&quot; the ranger said, &quot;he could already tell what I really wanted to become, just by lookin' at me.  He told me after I got accepted to the guild that I could always find my little druid friends by the messy tracks they left.  Now, tell me something.  Are you an enchanter that just needed a pointed stick?  Or is that sword you bear proof that you long for blood in combat?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I don't need to answer that,&quot; Almasy hissed, turning onto his side.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Well, give it some thought.  Sometimes, we already know what we want to become, and sometimes, it's handed to us by fate.  The trouble is knowing who has what coming.  But, if I were your father, I'd say something to you like, get away from those sissies in the robes, son, and get back to your sparring instructor!&quot;
</P>

<P>
Almasy gave a small laugh.  If he were my father....
</P>

<P>
&quot;I think you and I need to get some sleep before too long.  Tommorrow, I've got to head back to Surefall Glade and help a family friend with some duties.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Duties?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;My father died evening before last.  I have to help my two sisters perform last rites at his funeral.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Suddenly, Almasy felt a shiver like it were frozen outside.  He curled tightly on his side, inching closer to the fire.  Light skinned elves, half breeds especially, were always toying with the mind.  Never before had he heard of one so powerful in the way of magick that he could play with a man's heart, as well.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Good night, son,&quot; the old ranger said with a yawn.  &quot;I'll see you two off in the morning.  Sleep well.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Almasy closed his eyes, and was lulled into sleep by the sounds of crickets chirping.
