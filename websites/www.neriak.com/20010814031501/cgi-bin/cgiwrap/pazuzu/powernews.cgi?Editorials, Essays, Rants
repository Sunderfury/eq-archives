		No, this isn't going to turn into a sob story about how we need money or the site has to come down or any such rubbish.   You may have noticed that we haven't had banner ads up for a few months.  That's because the Ad Network that Allakhazam was part of (and we are/were an AllaK affiliate and so were a part of that Ad Network) went kaput.  We earned anywhere from $75-$200 per month off the ads (depending on how many patches were in the month; more patches means more hits to EQ fan sites).  We basically blew the money on fun things (if you didn't know, this site is run by a husband/wife team).  So honestly, we don't overly miss the ad revenue and we really like having the site AD FREE and I imagine most of you do too.<p>How much does operating this site cost us each month?  Well it's hard to say.  We own and operate a large net-based retail shop that has two domain names, and we also host a site for a friend who runs a non-profit large cat (read: lions and tigers) refuge.  So, with Neriak.COM added in we have 4 domains hosted.  The web hosting service we use is <A HREF="http://www.pair.com/" TARGET="new">Pair Networks, Inc</A>.  We pay $40.95 per month for hosting the 4 domains and the Secure Server addon for our net business.  <STRONG><EM>THAT'S IT</EM></STRONG>.  $40.95.  <p>Granted, we don't pull down nearly the bandwidth we used to since we haven't actively updated in ages.  We still pull a lot of bandwidth though, since people come here for reference information.  The charity (animal refuge) site pulls a bit and our net business and our personal sites pull A LOT.  We are allowed 400mb per day average daily transfer.  That's average.  If we pull down 2gb one day and for the rest of the month only 100mb a day that's only 163mb per day average.<p>If we needed higher bandwidth allotments it wouldn't cost much more.<p>What is my point?  Well to be blunt I don't understand why the <STRONG>f****</STRONG> people are paying <STRONG>SIX THOUSAND</STRONG> DOLLARS PER MONTH to host their EQ fan sites!  $6,000!  What the hell!?!!?<p>Now, I figure these people believe for whatever reason they need a dedicated server.  They don't.  This site (and all our sites) is on one of Pair's normal webservers.  There are several hundred in their datacenter.  It works fine.  It works great!  NO ONE (short of someone like SimTel) needs a dedicated server!  What's the point?  Even our lower-end account allows full custom CGI-BIN; you don't need a dedicated server to run your own CGIs.  Nor for SSI, PHP, MySQL, or anything really.  We have it all.<p>And, EVEN IF YOU DID, for whatever reason, feel you couldn't live without a dedicated server even THAT would only be $599 per month from Pair!  That includes 2gb average daily transfer.  The overage rate is $0.25 per MB on the average daily transfer.  So that works out to $256 per gig - but remember that's <STRONG><EM>average daily transfer</EM></STRONG>!  To pay $6,000 a month to Pair you would need to be on their highest end dedicated server plan and have an AVERAGE daily transfer of 24 GIGABYTES!  AVERAGE!  That's insane and honestly I doubt ANY fan site hits that.  Sure, maybe an active site like Allakhazam's hits 24 gigs on their busiest day but that's a PEAK, not an AVERAGE!  Big difference!<p>So, in short, we are never going to have a subscription system or banner/popup ads ever again here.<p>And, we URGE all other fan sites to consider all options.  You don't need a dedicated server and if you're paying anywhere NEAR $6,000 a month you frankly are getting robbed.<br> <P> (<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> This isn't meant to be an ad for Pair's services -- while they are excellent they are by no means the only game in town for web hosting... Check all your options!) </P>

		While on Test Center to capture some images of The Hole, I was fortunate enough to run into another roleplayer.<p>It's rare that I've seen people on Test Center roleplaying, usually they're exploring, sometimes testing quests and sometimes playing just like roleplayers and non-roleplayers do.  <p>He made a couple good points about Test Center that I'd like to share with you.  It's never very crowded.  You don't usually have to worry about something being camped, because chances are that the spawn isn't even broken!  And, something that I've found on Test Center too, people are usually really friendly on Test.<p>Yes, there is a chance that another player wipe can happen.  But, although I love gaining levels, I love playing with friends too!  Starting over doesn't bother me - because for me it's the fun of being with friends, roleplaying, adventuring and making new ones that makes EverQuest enjoyable for me.<p>If you have this same sense of adventure, and would like to adventure in a less crowded server, Test Center may be for you! =)<p>With thanks to the Enchanter I met this evening in Paineel,<p>

		For those of you who are evil and either plan to or who do currently hunt on the new continent, these words probably give chills.<p>For those of you who are unfamiliar with them, this is one of the factions that the evil outpost on Kunark is aligned with. Unfortunately this is also a faction that three dungeons on Kunark are aligned with.<p>One would think that this would allow us of evil bent to stroll into the dungeon unharmed (after all, why would allies attack us) but this is far from the truth. It seems that these allies perhaps have forgotten that we're their friends and attack us just like anything else would.  And then if we attack back, our VenrilSathir faction lowers.<p>What this means is that if you continue to hunt there that in time, you'd no longer be able to bank or purchase at our evil outpost, and would be kill on sight there.<p>This affects everything for evil races on the new continent, from not being able to kill freely, to not being able to hunt for your own equipment, to getting just frustrated with Verant in general for this factioning.<p>In Verant's defense, they have stated that we should get help from light races to procure items in these dungeons.  As if we would rely that heavily on slaves!  It has also been stated that this is part of a larger story that has yet to unfold.  But, all we of the Evil races of Norrath (not including those cold-blooded Iksar) know is that this seriously limits our hunting grounds and has lowered our morale.<p>We hope that Verant re-considers this factioning and comes up with a compromise instead. While we dark races love a challenge, this one has turned from fun into frustrating.

			Hail All-<p>	      Just last night I was at a friends house, and the uge to just bash some Froglok Tads entered my body, so I turned on EQ and decided to create a warrior. I started to make a Troll warrior as most other people might, but I realized I have yet to try an Iskar Warrior, so I created one. Needless to say, I am very impressed by the race/class combination. I was started off by being given an awesome pike, which I am still using at lvl 8. Yes I made 8 levels in one night (I'll get to that later). At level one, with skill level 0 for piercing I was jabbing frequently for 16 damage. That is a one hit kill for swamp leeches, mosquitoes and decaying skeletons. I level up to two within 15 minutes, and I am sure "good" playes could do it within 5 mins. (not counting giving your letter and all). Now as for the number of creatures, and the newbie zones, I love them. There are creatures literally everywhere on in the Feild of Bone and the Swamp of Hopelessness. They have guards semi-nearby to help you if you need it, and far off away so they won't kill steal. I really enjoy that the most, (it is great not having to worry about a nearby Dragoon or Iron Guardian). Additionally, they have the regen of a Troll! This was so fantastic for me b/c I could go out, beat for a while, get hurt, sit down for a short time, and then go beat some more! Thet get 4 HP per tick, and I just think it is awesome. Additionally, they have a auto Swim Skill of 100, and Foreage ability for all. I really think we need to look more into this class, and I hope we can see some more Iskar Warriors, and less Shamans and Monks =) j/k. <p>LONG LIVE DARKIES!

		        In EQ almost every class has its share of glory. I mean clerics are praised when they go anywhere, Enchanters are constantly being asked to group with someone, and Necros are able to stand alone if they really want to. There is one class though that recieves almost no respect, and is constantly over looked, what class is that you might ask? The Magician of course. I mean look at it this way, I once asked who all knew a level 50 wizard or Necro, and I recieved an overwhelming 20 /tells. After that I asked who all knew a level 50 Magician, and I recieved 2, where one /tell was "isn't there a lvl cap for those guys =)". Magicians are constantly abused and mistreated in my book, and I think they deserve alot of respect for what they do.<p>	How many other classes at lvl one can let your pet attack and damage something like a Will-o-wisp or a Ghoul? How many classes can summon you bandages to heal you after or during a battle? How many classes can summon you a magical backpack to cut the weight in half? There is only one, the Magician. We have a great lack of these casters in our dark world. I personally know only 30 serious Magicians on the entire Rathe server. We look at the class, think they will be cool to play, but at the first sign of trouble what do we do? We push the delete button, and bye bye goes our Magician. <p>	We need to hold on a second before we become frustrated, and try to solve whatever problem we have with our Mage. Sure he may not have the nukes like the Wizard, sure he may not have the pet like a Necro, sure he can't charm or heal like an Enchanter or Cleric, but what he can do is be totally self reliant. <p>	On any other class I guarantee you will spend well over 3000pp easily on a combination of food, water, weapons, armour, and components for spells by the time you are level 50. With the Magician you can do almost all of this for free. Think of just saving half that much, 1500pp, that is a whole new skill you could learn, that is a VERY nice suit of armour for a new character you might create, thatis a whole lotta money for anyone at any level. Why not save it?<p>	I don't ask for everyone to go out and make a DElf Magician right now, all I ask is you give the class a chance, and if you see a struggling Magician in trouble, help him out, and maybe thank him for adding a little variety to the Dark Races. Just respect the class, and realize, the overlooked can easily be your best friend.
