<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Travelling, while basically required to be successful in Everquest, is very 
difficult for Dark Races.  Light race characters can basically enter any 
&quot;travel&quot; zone at will, and the guards and NPCs there will be friendly 
and helpful.  Dark Race characters, for the most part, will be slain on sight.  
Our only benefit is that some NPCs, such as Dorn in Northern Ro and the Dragoon 
in Western Commonlands will leave us alone.  Yet the guards in these zones will 
kill us quickly.  This guide will hopefully serve to guide those new to 
travelling far from their home zones, and help them to avoid certain death.
</P>

<P>
This guide covers my travels so far, which may be quite limited, but this guide 
should still serve to inform the curious as to how to best travel in safety.  
Last update: December 8, 1999.  I am level 17 as of this update.
</P>

<H3>Antonica</H3>

<P>
Since all Dark Race characters begin on the continent of Antonica, this is where 
the guide will start.  All of the popular and lucrative dungeons are on 
Antonica, so it is likely the most of your time will be spent on this continent.  
I'll start with Nektulos, the Tier'dal starting area, and move out from there.
</P>

<P>
In Nektulos Forest, and the adjoining Lavastorm mountains, you are 100% safe 
from guard troubles so long as you have not damaged your faction standings.  
Light race characters will be attacked on sight by the guards in Nektulos, but 
we dark races are left alone.  There is an NPC Bard named Travis Two Tone 
in Nektulos, near the border with Eastern Commonlands.  He will attack 
dark races and is about level 22 or so.  The guards will kill him if you 
take him to them.  There are no guards in Lavastorm, but there is an NPC Paladin 
that spawns RARELY, and who is about level 16 or so.  Watch out for him unless 
you can slay him.  
</P>

<P>
Nektulos has several agressive monsters, these are young  kodiaks, black wolves, 
shadow wolves, skeletons, zombies, and lesser mummies.  Black wolves are easy to 
kill, they are level 1-3 or so.  Shadow wolves are around 3-5, maybe 6.  Young 
kodiaks are 8-10 or so.  Skeletons run from 5-8 or so; zombies, 7-11; and 
mummies are 9-13 or so.  All of these will attack on sight regardless of race or 
faction.  Additionally, fire beetles and spiderlings will assist their brothers 
and sisters should you attack them.  Newbies beware -- it is common to see a 
poor newbie mobbed by 10 spiderlings or fire beetles when all they wanted was 
one.
</P>

<P>
Lavastorm has a host of aggressive MOBs -- these include fire imps, fire 
elementals, and fire goblins.  <STRONG>Beware</STRONG> of the /con messages of 
these MOBs!!  When a fire elemental /cons blue to you, think 
<STRONG>yellow</STRONG>!  They have fire shields that damage you every time you 
hit them and unless you have the spell Cancel Magic to take it down, it's going 
to hurt you badly.  I've been killed by blue fire elementals and imps at level 
15 and 16, and it's not uncommon.  Even higher level rogues and monks will 
refuse to fight these things unless the fireshields are taken down.
</P>

<P>
As far as hunting in Nektulos and Lavastorm, the guide to levelling in and near 
Nektulos, available on this site, covers this quite well.  The focus of this 
guide is travel, not what to do once you reach your destination. :)
</P>

<P>
Leaving the relatively safe area of Nektulos and Lavastorm, we first reach 
Eastern Commonlands -- this is the only connection between home sweet home 
(Nektulos) and the rest of the world.  The Commonlands are a human-controlled 
area, patrolled by Freeport's Knights of Truth and corrupt Freeport Militia.  We 
are not liked in the human areas, and there are several very high level, very 
aggressive guards in EC that love to kill us dark types.  Additionally, most of 
the vendors will attempt to kill us!  EC has connections to Nektulos (of 
course), Northern Ro, Freeport, and Western Commonlands.  Aggressive MOBs in EC 
include lions and lionesses (levels 8-13 or so), orcs (widely varying in levels, 
found at the orc camps here), griffins (level 35+, WATCH OUT), and various 
undead - lesser mummies, zombies, skeletons, and ghouls (up to level 18 or 19 
[ghouls]) -- found at the undead ruin. 
</P>

<P>
Northern Ro is reached  by heading straight out from the Nektulos tunnel, past 
some huts with &quot;Plague&quot; flags around them, and straight on to the 
opposite zone wall.  You will see a huge tunnel in side of the desert wall.  
This will lead you to Northern Ro.  Beware, there are often guards in this 
tunnel who will certainly attack you.
</P>

<P>
To get to Western Commonlands, simply follow to the right as you leave the 
Nektulos tunnel.  Stay up on the zone wall and you will zone into Western 
Commonlands.
</P>

<P>
To get to Freeport, Innoruuk only knows why you'd want to, follow the road you 
see as you exit the Nektulos tunnel.  Eventually you'll find a fork, follow it 
to the left to the desert area and keep going straight.  You will zone into 
Freeport.  Good luck, the guards will likely kill you. :)
</P>

<P>
Moving further away from Nektulos, we have Northern Ro and Western Commonlands.  
I will first cover the route through the Ro Deserts, finally reaching the 
Troll's home of Grobb, and then will cover the route through WC to Highhold 
Pass.  </P>

<P>
Northern Ro is one of the first really high-danger areas you will probably come 
across.  It's not overly dangerous, but there are some very high level, very 
aggressive MOBs here.  The first thing to note is that SAND GIANTS can be found 
here.  They are rare, but they are here, they will hit you for over 90 pts and 
have double attack, and you will probably die if one hits you.  On the bright 
side, they are very, very big and do look very impressive the first time you see 
one.  From a distance.  Don't get close. :)  There are some inns near the 
Freeport/North Ro border, I've not been over there, but I assume they hate us 
over there.  There is also a Dark Elf NPC in this zone that likes to kill light 
races, but he will leave us dark types alone.  Other aggressive MOBs include 
ghouls, skeletons, zombies, mummies, orcs (widely varying levels), and Dervish 
Cutthroats (level 8-15).
</P>

<P>
If you head southeast (use your sense heading skill!) after leaving the tunnel 
from EC, you will eventually hit water.  Turn south and follow the water, and 
you will zone into the Oasis of Marr, often referred as just &quot;Oasis&quot;.
</P>

<P>
I once zoned into Oasis and was greeted with four Spectres staring at me.  
There is a dead zone where MOBs can't really see you right as you zone in, so I 
was in no real danger, but I thought of taking a screenshot and titling it 
&quot;Another Day in Oasis&quot;.  Welcome to real danger.  Sand Giants (level 
35 plus, very big, very impressive, very deadly - double attack for 90+ a pop) 
and spectres (level 35+, undead, VERY impressive and scary looking, very 
aggressive, and very deadly) are quite common here.  There are also lesser 
mummies, shriveled mummies, crypt mummies, dry bones skeletons, desert madmen, 
orcs of varying levels all the way up to level 20 or so, and some very deadly 
snakes (though thankfully they aren't aggressive) -- don't attack a cistern asp 
unless there is a cleric nearby.  The venom will kill you.  All this is 
dangerous enough for the light races, but we get to be attacked by the 
innkeepers and gypsies that the light races love as well!  Certain Dark Elves 
(usually Agnostics) will be left alone, but I can tell you first hand that the 
gypsies and innkeepers will kill trolls.  I was double attacked for 2-3 rounds 
for 96 a pop by a female innkeeper.  Excuse me, a bar wench smacking a big 
strong troll around for over 300 damage?  WTF? :) Just watch out.  If you follow 
the water upon zoning from Northern Ro, you'll come to a zone wall, follow it 
way from the water and you'll see the zone to Southern Ro.  
</P>

<P>
Southern Ro is far less dangerous than Oasis, but there are still Sand Giants 
about, though very uncommon.  No spectres, thank Innoruuk.  The usual desert 
stuff -- undead, orcs, and Dervish Cutthroats.  If you follow the zone wall to 
the right, you'll come to the zone tunnel to Innothule swap, the Troll newbie 
area.
</P>

<P>
Following the zone wall left after you zone in from Southern Ro, you'll first 
come to the entrance to the fabled dungeon, Guk.  It's a cave with 2 froglok 
guards standing outside.  Don't go in unless you know you can handle it.  It's 
the largest and most popular dungeon in the game, and it's also quite deadly.  
You'll be able to hunt there soon enough.  Keep following the zone wall and 
you'll eventually come to the entrance to Grobb, home of the trolls.  You'll 
know it by the tents with Bashers (troll guards).  As far as I 
know there are no aggressive uber-MOBs here except for the  Bashers, but they 
leave dark races alone. Congratulations, you are now as far South on Antonica as 
is possible!  
</P>

<P>
Moving back to the Commonlands, after zoning into Western Commons from Eastern 
Commons, you can either follow the north wall or head to the south wall and 
follow that.  Along the north wall is an undead tower, a Dervish Cutthroat camp, 
and an orc camp.  Along the south wall is the entrance to Befallen, a level 7-18 
or so dungeon.  The guards in this zone are quite aggressive to dark races and 
will certainly kill you on sight.  Also in this zone are griffins, Hill Giants 
and Nightfall Giants (WATCH OUT!), kodiaks (level 15-20 or so), werewolves 
(18-22 or so, hit VERY fast!), and the usual young kodiaks and black bears.  
Following either zone wall will lead you to the zone tunnel to Kithicor Forest.  
</P>

<P>
Kithicor Forest used to be an alternate Halfling newbie area (basically you 
could choose either Kithicor or Misty Thicket), now it is nothing but a complete 
deathtrap.  If you are going to travel through Kithicor, do it ONLY during the 
daytime (use the /time command), and do it only with SOW (Spirit of Wolf) on.  
Immediately upon zoning in, get out of the tunnel, head right and climb as high 
on the zone wall as you can and DO NOT STOP!  During the nighttime, some very 
very high level undead (35-40+) spawn and wreak havoc, and often they are not 
killed off and so they last into the daytime.  Do not take any chances, get SOW, 
get high on that right zone wall and don't stop.  Eventually you'll come to the 
zone valley into Highhold Pass.  If you don't stay high enough on the wall, 
you'll also come across the zone entrance to Rivervale, the city of the 
Halflings, certain death to dark races.  So stay high up on the wall and you'll 
be fine.  You'll be forced to come down when you get to the zone to Highhold 
Pass.
</P>

<P>
Highhold Pass is a fun zone to many, while others hate it completely.  The 
reason is that it is considered (by convention, and this is on Xegony, may not 
be true on other servers -- ask around!) a Free-for-all (FFA) zone.  Anything 
that spawns is fair game.  When an orc spawns, everyone smacks it with 
everything they have in an effort to get the most damage thereby winning the EXP 
and loot.  It's really fun IMO.  Also it's great EXP and loot here for levels 
14-20, and beyond as you travel deeper into HH.  The orc area is right at the 
zone to Kithicor and that is as far in as I've been.  This zone is the only safe 
way for Dark Races to get from the Freeport/Neriak area to the Qeynos area.  
Rivervale isn't an option, so you have to use HH.
</P>

<H3>The Other Continents</H3>

<P>
Travel to the other continents is difficult. Odus can only be reached via the 
ships in Qeynos or Wizard/Druid teleport spells.  Faydwer can only be reached 
via the ship in Freeport or via a Teleport from a Wizard or Druid.  Odus would 
be folly, it is a very small continent and there is nothing of note there.  
Faydwer is likewise folly as we are very KOS there, but there are several zones 
of note, including Estate of Unrest, Dagnor's Cauldron, Kedge Keep, Lesser 
Faydark, and Steamfont Mountains.  Rogues can use hide/sneak and casters have to 
use the Freeport tunnels to reach the docks where the ship sails from.  I've not 
traced out the tunnels yet, look for that info in an upcoming update.
