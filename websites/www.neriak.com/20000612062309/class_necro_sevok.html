<H4>Introduction</H4>

<P>
Among the four &quot;pure&quot; casting classes, the Necromancer is perhaps the 
most unusual, with the Enchanter being a close second.  Wizards are pretty 
straightforward -- they beat the crap out of things in very short order; 
Magicians are basically a weakened Wizard with a pet to make up for it; 
Enchanters get some awesome buffs and debuffs, and a near-worthless animation as 
a pet that they can't even control; Necromancers get some incredibly wicked 
Damage Over Time (DOT) spells, a very powerful pet, the ability to charm the 
undead or ward them back into the grave, and some very good personal buff 
spells.  Playing a Necromancer is not like playing any other casting class.
</P>

<P>
This guide is meant to be used in conjunction with the Necromancer spell listing 
at <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">Casters Realm</A> [clickable].  That 
site contains an exact, detailed list of all spells you receive, with accurate 
damage statistics and so forth.  I won't list the names of each pet spell, for 
instance; you can instead can that information from Casters Realm.
</P>

<H4>Creating your Corpse-hugger :)</H4>

<P>
If druids are tree-huggers, then Necromancers are corpse-huggers.  Or 
corpse-makers, depending on how you look at it.
</P>

<P>
Anyway, creating a Necromancer character is very simple.  For Race, choose Dark 
Elf.  Other races can be Necromancers, sure -- Humans (Welcome to Mediocrity!), 
Gnomes (walking footstools), and Erudites (bah), but those races hate their 
Necromancers and even in your own hometown you would be shunned.  On the other 
hand, Necromancers are honored and revered in Teir'dal society and are loved in 
all of Neriak.  Additionally, Dark Elves have the second highest starting 
Intelligence among all races, making them excellent casters.  So, choose Dark 
Elf.  For Stat allotment, simply put all you can into Intelligence.  No 
reason to argue -- INT equals Mana equals your power to hurt MOBs and 
thereby gain experience and wealth.  More mana, more killing, less  downtime, 
end of story. :)  Deity, Innoruuk (only choice); starting town Neriak (also only 
choice).  You'll get a warning about this race/class/deity combo being of high 
difficulty, accept that and realize the path of the Necromancer is never an easy 
one.
</P>

<P>
After doing all of that and logging in as your Necromancer, do the normal new 
character stuff -- your guild quest, scribing and memming your first two spells, 
and so forth.  This isn't a beginner's EQ guide, you should already know these 
steps, if not, then read a more basic guide to EQ.
</P>

<H4>Early Strategies</H4>

<P>
Once you earn enough money killing the standard newbie creatures and selling 
their loot, start buying up your level 1 spells.  First buy the level 1 pet 
spell (Cavorting Bones), then the rest of the spells.  Your level 1 pet frankly 
sucks but it's better than nothing and will train you on how to use a pet, 
which you're going to be doing for the rest of your life, so use it at all 
times.  
</P>

<P>
Pets are pretty easy to use -- there are only a few commands they respond to, 
and you will use even fewer.  The commands are: /pet guard me - tell the pet to 
guard you - redundant, because the pet is <STRONG>always</STRONG> guarding you; 
/pet follow me - tell the pet to follow you; /pet sit down - has the pet sit 
down, causing it to regain HP faster; /pet stand up - has the pet stand up again 
after sitting down; /pet guard here - tells the pet to stay in one place, 
guarding;  /pet taunt - tells the pet to taunt what it's fighting (the default); 
/pet notaunt - tells the pet to not taunt the things it's fighting; /pet back 
off - tells the pet to stop fighting what it's currently fighting - note that if 
the MOB hits you or the pet, forget it, the pet is going to continue fighting; 
/pet attack - duh; /pet get lost - kills the pet.  Most Necromancers make a 
hotkey bank with the 6 most used pet commands -- these vary from player to 
player, over time you'll find out what works best for you. 
</P>

<P>
If you hand your pet a weapon (just like trading with a player), it will wield 
it.  Note that there is no way to get it back, so don't give it anything good.  
Unlike players, the only thing weapons do for pets is possibly make them attack 
faster.  Each pet spell has a maximum damage the pet will do, regardless of 
weapon.  So the only reason to give it a weapon is to make it attack faster.  A 
pet's fists attack at a speed of 30, so any weapon with a speed of 30 or better 
will help the pet, whereas a weapon with a speed over 30 will hurt the pet 
because it will make him attack slower.  Also note that later on, your pet will 
gain the ability to dual wield -- so giving him two weapons will be desirable.  
</P>

<P>
From level 1 thru level 4, you basically are going to make sure your shielding 
spell is active, then pull a beast to you with a Lifetap or some other offensive 
spell, and then beat on the thing in melee along with your pet, and cast more 
Lifetaps here and there until the thing dies.  You are insanely weak at these 
levels.  Do not worry -- it's more than made up for by the power you will soon 
start to feel
</P>

<P>
Once you reach  level 4, you get Meditate, which will make your life a LOT 
easier, and more new spells.  Get the pet spell first again, and then Clinging 
Darkness, then the rest.  The level 4 pet is a <STRONG>huge</STRONG> upgrade and 
will serve you quite well.  Clinging Darkness is the first spell in the Darkness 
&quot;line&quot;, line being a term for a group of spells that you receive 
updates to throughout your career.  The Darkness line is a great group of spells 
because they reduce your target's movement speed, allowing you to get off more 
spells before they reach melee range.  The Darkness line also does Damage Over 
Time (DOT).
</P>

<P>
Typical level 4 strategy goes like this:  pull with Darkness, send pet, hit with 
poison bolt, maybe then drop a disease cloud and/or siphon strength, then help 
out the pet with melee or maybe a few lifetaps.  This is a pretty sound, easy, 
and safe kill strategy.  You'll probably use all your mana, but at these levels 
you don't have much so medding back up to full shouldn't be a big deal.  The 
medding time will also give your pet time to heal back to full.  Make sure you 
don't start a fight unless your pet is at full health -- you can check this at 
any time with /pet report health. 
</P>

<P>
If you get into trouble, you can also use your Fear spell to make the monster 
run away in fear.  This is not a permanent solution -- the spell will wear off 
and when it does the monster will come back, possibly bringing his friends to 
kill you.  So you'll need to either zone, or find a way to kill it when it comes 
back.  Still, Fear can save your life.
</P>

<P>
This type of strategy will continue pretty much up until level 12.  Level 8 
brings new spells again -- as always get your pet spell first, then the rest.  
There are a few things to note at level 8.  
</P>

<P>
The first is that you get Ward Undead. This will allow you to do (for the 
level) a high amount of damage to undead creatures.  It's not mana-light, it 
uses quite a bit of mana, but if you are fighting the undead you will be more 
efficient than most other classes because of this spell.
</P>

<P>
You also get Dark Pact, the first in a line of fairly unique spells.  What it 
does is trade some of your HP for Mana over a period of time.  It's not a 1:1 
trade, you get more Mana than you lose HP.  To some players, especially those 
who have experience with melee classes, this spell seems terrifying.  They can't 
understand why you would want to trade HP for Mana.  Well, it's quite simple -- 
you are a Caster, and Casters are NOT supposed to get hit much, if at all.  It 
is FAR more important that you have Mana, because as long as you have Mana you 
can cast spells and do damage.  Dark Pact is also great to cast right before you 
sit down to meditate as it will greatly reduce the time it takes to med up to 
full.
</P>

<P>
Finally, you get Dark Empathy.  This may not be useful to you at this level 
because you are likely exclusively soloing, but if you do want to help others, 
you can finally do so.  The spell transfers some of your HP to another 
character.  So, at the cost of your own health, you can heal others.  Just 
something to take note of.
</P>

<H4>Level 12</H4>

<P>
Level 12 brings another change in your power, and probably in your killing 
strategy.  You get the first in another line of DOT spells -- Heat Blood.  This 
is a VERY nice DOT, and you will be using it a lot.  Please note that it is 
heat-based and DOES NOT work in Lavastorm.  You also get an upgrade to the 
Darkness line, Engulfing Darkness.  Also of note you get Bind Affinity, so you 
can finally Bind yourself anywhere you like.
</P>

<P>
You will probably want to change your tactics at this point.  You can continue 
killing Blue-con creatures and possibly some White/Blacks with your same tactic, 
but if you like, you can take on some much tougher beasts, including yellows and 
reds, but you have to change how you fight.  Your pet can no longer stay in 
melee with these beasts long enough for the MOB to die, so you'll have to make 
the creature not hit your pet.
</P>

<P>
The way to do this is with Fear.  What you do is this, find a yellow or JUST red 
beast (i.e., just barely red... not a spectre for instance), pull it with 
Darkness, send the pet, hit it with Heat Blood and then FEAR IT.  It will turn 
and run, the DOTs will be doing full damage because it's fleeing, and also the 
pet will be following it and beating on it.  If the Fear breaks, just re-fear 
it.  If the DOTs wear off before it's dead, just re-apply them or just use 
Lifedraws to finish it.  You need to use the Fear tactic to do this because MOBs 
of yellow/red con will kill your pet long before the DOTs kill it, and then it's 
coming for YOU.  For example, Kodiaks (ADULT kodiaks, not young kodiaks) con 
yellow and red (it varies) at 13 and 14.  They hit very hard (high 30s) and 
pretty fast.  They'll shred your pet pretty quick -- if you don't believe me try 
it. :)  But, I can solo them with this tactic at 13 and up.  
</P>

<P>
Save a small amount of Mana in case something goes wrong.  If your pet dies or 
you run way too low on Mana to finish the thing, just Shadowstep a few times to 
get far away from the MOB and then run for the zone.  You may still occasionally 
die but this will seriously cut down on it.  Shadowstep uses very little Mana 
and has a very short casting time, so it's great for putting quick distance 
between you and something that's beating you up bad.  The beast will still come 
for you, so you need to either run for the zone or gate.  Don't try to cast gate 
while in melee, it will never work.  Shadowstep 1-2 times first.
</P>

<H4>Level 16</H4>

<P>
As with all previous spell groups, the level 16 spells bring yet another huge 
jump in power.  As before, buy your pet spell (Restless Bones) first, and then 
the rest.  Most especially Heart Flutter.  Heart Flutter is a new DOT -- and it 
is a good one!  Not only does it do pretty decent damage, it also drops the 
target's Strength and AC as well.  It makes your pet and any other melee fighter 
much more effective, and makes them take less damage due to the MOB's reduced 
STR.
</P>

<P>
You also get a huge amount of new buffs, most of which are as always self-only.  
You get Shielding, an upgrade to your personal shield spells (starts at level 1 
with minor shielding -- you've gotten 2 or 3 upgrades to this series already, 
you should have been buying them all along).  This should be kept active on 
yourself at all times.  It adds Magic Resist, Hit Points, and AC.  Another new 
spell is Shieldskin -- this is a strange sort of spell that doesn't add to any 
stats, instead it adds a 100-point or so damage sink.  The first 100 points of 
damage you take while this spell is active simply sink into the shield; you take 
no damage.  It's expensive to cast, requiring a Cat's Eye Agate at 0.2.5.3 per 
stone, but it's well worth it.  And finally, you get Spirit Armor.  This is a 
<EM>targetable</EM> (believe it or not!) armor class (AC) buff that you can cast 
on anyone -- including your pet!  It adds 15 AC, which doesn't seem like much, 
but it's at least a little helpful.  And it's targetable. :)
</P>

<P>
Another spell you receive at this level, Feign Death, is quite controversial.  
What it does it allow you to &quot;play dead&quot;, hopefully tricking MOBs into 
thinking you're dead and hence leaving you alone.  Opinions on this spell's 
usefulness and safety are extremely varied, and I have yet to test it in the 
field, so I cannot comment on strategies for using it.  I'll update this once 
I've tested it, but for now, I am simply mentioning that Necromancers do in fact 
receive this spell at level 16. :)
</P>

<P>
Also of note is Cancel Magic.  This is a great spell, especially if you hunt in 
Lavastorm.  Tired of those &quot;YOU are burned!&quot; or &quot;Jabartik was 
burned.&quot; messages?  Those are from the fireshields that a lot of Lavastorm 
(and other zones as well, Lavastorm just seems to be really bad for this) MOBs 
have on them.  These shields can be taken down with Cancel Magic and then you 
will no longer get damaged each time you hit the MOB.  You may have to cast it 
2, sometimes even 3 times to remove the fireshield, but when you no longer get 
burned when you hit the MOB, you'll be very thankful you took down the shield.  
This spell can also remove buffs from MOBs, and you can even use it to remove 
harmful spells (such as DOTs) from yourself, your pet, and your group members.  
It doesn't work (on non-PvP servers) on anyone but MOBs, yourself, your pet, and 
those in your group.  This is to prevent jerks from running around taking buffs 
off people.  
</P>

<H4>Level 20</H4>

<P>
Ah, at last!  Level 20, the age of Norrathian majority, where you can choose 
your surname.  Choose it with pride, and use the /surname command to add it, or 
have a Senior Guide do it if it contains an accent mark. :)
</P>

<P>
This is another great level for Necromancers.  We get a new pet, as with all new 
spell circles.  This one is another great upgrade, it summons a powerful pet 
indeed.  You are of course /con'ing your pets and making sure they are the most 
powerful available, right?  Generally, at the level of the spell itself (i.e., 
level 20 for the level 20 summon spell), the strongest pet will /con with 
&quot;looks kind of dangerous&quot;.  Make sure you keep using /pet get lost and 
re-summoning until you get the powerful one or you could find yourself in a heap 
of trouble.
</P>

<P>
This level brings us another ability we share with all pure casting classes (and 
priest classes as well) - Specialization.  This allows us to specialize in a 
certain casting skill (Alteration, Abjuration, Evocation, Divination, 
Conjuration), thereby reducing mana usage, casting time, fizzle rate, and resist 
rate for spells of that type.  What you do is, at level 20, go to your guild and 
train ALL FIVE specialization skills.  Just put one point into each, this will 
make your skill 20 in all of them.  THEN, you cast a spell of the type you want 
to primarily specialize in until that Specialization skill is 51.  That sets 
your primary specialization.  DO NOT leave this to chance!  Mem a level 1 spell 
of the type you want to have your primary specialization in, and cast until you 
get 51 in that specialization.  Most Necromancers pick Alteration and this is 
the logical choice - our lifetaps, and most of our DOT spells use Alteration, so 
reducing mana usage, cast time, and resist/fizzle rate of these spells is a Good 
Thing(tm).
</P>

<P>
At level 20, we also finally get a new lifetap spell.  This is a nice upgrade, 
as we can now steal 65hp of life (at level 20) from our foes.  This is a good 
thing, because we also get Allure of Death, with trades 8 hp for 8 mana each 
tick for quite some time.  This, as with the lower power spell Dark Pact, is the 
true power of a Necromancer - converting life into mana and then stealing that 
life back from our foes.  No other class can do this and it is the secret of 
ultra-successful Necromancers.
</P>

<P>
If you like to hunt Undead, this is a great level also!  We get Expulse Undead, 
which does a large amount of damage to Undead - it's a great upgrade to our 
level 8 Ward Undead spell.  We also get Dominate Undead, which allows us to 
charm an undead monster for a period of time.  You can't have a summoned pet at 
the same time, but clearing out an Undead camp using one of the undead from the 
camp as your pet (especially when there's a bunch of zombies and a ghoul - charm 
the ghoul!) to kill the rest, then killing the pet when the charm wears off is 
great fun.  Be warned that the charm WILL wear off, and when it does, your 
former pet is going to be VERY MAD at you.  Be prepared to kill it quick.
</P>

<P>
Also of note is Shadow Vortex, which lowers the target's AC.  This is great, 
especially at these lower levels, as it allows your pet (and your melee class 
groupmates if you have them) to hit more often and for more damage.  Use it, 
love it. :)
<P>

<H4>Level 24</H4>

<P>
Ahhhh... What a true level of power this is for a Necromancer!  So many spells 
we receive at this level are truly powerful, it's very hard to explain how 
strong you will feel when you finally get this level!
</P>

<P>
You get an upgrade to your personal shield, Major Shielding, that gives a nice 
boost to your standard shielding.  Also, Leatherskin is now available, which is 
an upgrade to Shieldskin and will damage-sink around 200 damage -- a very nice 
benefit!  The spell requires a bloodstone and is well worth it.
</P>

<P>
Of course, as always, you receive a new pet spell (Haunting Corpse), though this 
time it is research only, so you will need to obtain the Words and create the 
spell via research, or purchase it from another player.  Mythiran Tower (<A 
HREF="http://mythiran.allakhazam.com/" TARGET="new">click here</A>) has all the 
research information.  Your pet at this level appears very dark, a nice visual 
upgrade.
</P>

<P>
Another research only spell, Intensify Death, is a pet-only buff that truly 
makes your pet a death machine!  It only lasts 5 minutes, so what you do is cast 
the spell on your pet right before a tough battle and then send him in to kill.  
You will really notice a difference in effectiveness using this spell.
</P>

<P>
Now we come to the true surprise of this level.  Shock of Poison.  Poison?  A 
Necromancer spell?  Must be another DOT, right?  Nope.  146 direct damage at 
level 24.  No waiting, 146 damage instantly.  Wow...  It's hard to describe how 
wonderful it is to finally have this spell!  Basically you will: buff pet, send 
pet, darkness, wait a while, then SOP SOP, dead.  Easy fights.  This spell is 
really effective at this level -- 146 damage is a lot at level 24, especially 
for Necromancers who are used to having to wait 60 seconds or more to see the 
full damage of their spells.  You will use this spell A LOT.
</P>

<P>
You also get a few utility spells at this level: Breath of the Dead, a self-only 
underwater breathing spell; Resist Cold, a cold resistance buff; Rest the Dead, 
an undead-only lull spell; and Screaming Terror, which is SUPPOSED to cause a 
stun effect/mesmerize effect, but I have yet to see it actually do ANYTHING on 
the MOBs I've tried it on.
</P>

<P>
All in all, level 24 is a true power level for the Necromancer.  Enjoy it!
</P>

<H4>Beyond</H4>

<P>
What lies beyond this point is unknown to me as I am just at Level 24  myself!  
I am writing this guide as I progress so that everything is still fresh in my 
mind when I write it down, hopefully providing a better guide.  This is a work 
in progress, and as I progress in my career as a Necromancer, I'll continue to 
update this guide.
