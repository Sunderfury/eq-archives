<P>
Once you reach Level 20, you will probably be wondering where to travel next for 
experience.  For light races, this is a great time -- most of the world is 
opened to them, as they can travel pretty much anywhere they like without worry 
of being slain by guards.  It's a little trickier for Dark Races, as we have 
guard KOS concerns to be aware of.  The problem is even worse for non-caster 
classes as they have to be bound in a city.  There are, however, several places 
one can go and remain fairly safe, at least from guard troubles.
</P>

<P>
You can, of course, go to an area or dungeon that light races go to, but of 
course some of them are going to be more difficult to get to.  The Faydwer 
dungeons -- Unrest and Mistmoore -- are going to be hard to get to, especially 
if you're not a caster.  All the guards and NPCs on Faydwer are completely 
hostile to dark races and will happily kill you on sight.  If you are a caster, 
you can probably go invisible and then bind close to the dungeon, but it's still 
risky as the invisibility tends to wear off at inopportune moments.  There are 
better options, however.
</P>

<H3>Oasis</H3>

<P>
The vast majority of dark race characters reach level 20 in the Oasis of  Marr.  
It is, in my opinion, the best place to do it despite its problems.  After one 
reaches level 20, Oasis is still good for experience, but by this point, most 
people find they need money and items, and Oasis frankly is horrible for that 
purpose.
</P>

<P>
Still, though, it is good for experience.  What you want to do, after level 20, 
is to get yourself into a Deepwater Goblin Pet group.  Note that is DW Goblin 
PET group, NOT DW Goblins themselves.  Leave those alone.  The pets are good 
EXP, however, and there is always a group fighting them that you should be able 
to get into.
</P>

<P>
The DW Goblin Pets can take you pretty deep into the 20s, and that is about it 
for Oasis hunting until you are in the 30s and can finally kill off those 
Spectres and Sand Giants that annoyed (read: killed) you in your teens.
</P>

<H3>Najena</H3>

<P>
The first of the &quot;real&quot; dungeons (i.e., where valuable items are 
obtained) that characters can enter is probably Najena.  It is easily 
reached by zoning into Lavastorm from Nektulos, heading right along the zone 
wall, and going through the HUGE wooden doors you will come to(one of them is 
lying down off its hinge).  
</P>

<P>
There  are  things that even level 10 and a little below can kill here (large 
and greater skeletons), but they need to stay very close to the zone to 
Lavastorm.  The first thing, though, that most people come here to hunt are 
Tentacle Terrors.  They are quite good exp and loot for levels 18 thru high 20s, 
though at the higher end, it's going to be slow.  If you follow the tunnel after 
zoning into Najena, you will first come to a small round room with skeletons.  
Ignore them or kill them, your choice; you will probably not get exp for them at 
this level.  Follow the tunnel out the other end of that room, and you will come 
out in a round room with a big fire in the middle.  Skeletons and an ogre guard 
spawn here and depending on your level you may need to drop the ogre guard.  
There are three exits from this room -- one back the way you came, one to the 
left, and another straight ahead and a bit to the right.  If you go left, you 
will enter the &quot;main&quot; area of Najena, and may get jumped by a bunch of 
elementals.  If you have a group this might not be a problem but you also 
probably won't get exp and it will be a long fight.  Instead, take the straight 
exit and you will be in the first Terror area.
</P>

<P>
Two Tentacle Terrors can spawn here -- one in the far small round room, and one 
in the little alcove along the left wall.  The spawn times are 18.5 minutes, and 
sometimes you will get a placeholder (large skeleton) instead of a Terror.  
Sometimes you will need to fight two Terrors at once and that can get tricky, so 
you probably want to bring a small group to do this.  They don't hit very hard, 
and they don't cast overly damaging spells (they will use a level 1 lifetap 
every now and then), but they do have a spell that will throw you back away from 
them a good distance, but it doesn't damage you.  They drop from no cash up to a 
few plat, words, RARELY a gem, rarely Terror Spines which are used for a Shaman 
quest, and rarely a Tentacle Whip -- a mediocre 1h slashing weapon that procs 
lifetap.
</P>

<P>
Once you get into the low 20s, you can start camping some of the named spawns 
here.  Probably the first you can tackle will be the BoneCracker, a Froglok 
Ghoul that drops the Barbed Leather Whip - a decent 1h slashing weapon.  There 
are lots of other named spawns here: Trazdon, Drelzna, Moosh, and even Najena 
herself.  All of these (except Moosh) drop some pretty nice stuff -- especially 
Najena herself, who drops the Flowing Black Robe and the Black Tome with Silver 
Runes (the Tome is a rare drop; +4 INT and +30 Mana).  You will need to be near 
mid 20s to handle these, and by that time, if you've spent any time here, you 
will have learned your way around just from talking to others and grouping.  
I'll leave the exploration and discovery up to you; it's a lot of fun.  
</P>

<H3>Solusek's Eye (Sol A)</H3>

<P>
Solusek's Eye, aka Sol A, is a great place for EXP, loot, and action (read: 
danger).  It is possible to hunt here from levels 20 thru 35 or so, possibly 
even higher.  For Dark Races, the danger is quite high -- there are Gnomes and 
Clockworks here that will kill on sight most dark race characters.  If someone 
shouts about a gnome and/or clockwork train, get the hell out fast!
</P>

<P>
To get to Sol A, zone into Lavastorm, and follow the left zone wall.  You will 
come to first the gypsy camp, then the druid ring, then a HUGE pool of lava.  
You will notice three tunnels around the rim of the lava pool.  The one on the 
zonewall side is the zone into the Temple of Solusek Ro, a quest starter zone.  
The two on the opposite side are Sol A and Sol B.  Sol B is the one closest to 
the lava, Sol A is farther up.  You want Sol A. :)
</P>

<P>
Trolls and Ogres are going to need to get a Shrink from a Shaman when
adventuring in Sol A.  The passageways are very narrow and if you don't get Shrunken, you will 
be nothing but a deathtrap for yourself and everyone else.  Don't be a jerk, get 
a Shrink.  There's usually a Shaman around who can cast Shrink on you -- make 
sure you get the Shrink INSIDE the dungeon as the effect doesn't last through 
zoning. 
</P>

<P>
You will probably want to hunt goblins -- clockworks and gnomes are far too 
tough until the 30s I believe.  You're going to need a group here -- it's 
almost impossible to get just one goblin alone; many times you will be fighting 
three.  This dungeon is BY FAR the best training grounds for grouping tactics 
that I've seen so far, and many high level players I know agree with me.  
</P>

<P>
There are 6 types of goblins here, they are, from easiest to  hardest: Young, 
Cinder, Flame, Fire, Inferno, and Solusek.  Each type can be either a 
warrior (i.e. &quot;a young goblin&quot;), a shaman, or a wizard.  There are 
also several named goblins that drop some nice items -- for instance the Solusek 
champion and the Solusek goblin king.  Stay away from those until you are ready.  
The goblins are not hard to fight -- the shamans and wizards are a bit annoying 
so drop them first if you pull more than one gob.  Also many of them will have 
fireshields up so make sure your casters understand to use Cancel Magic to drop 
those shields.  The worst thing about them comes when you have to run.  They 
backstab.  Hard.  Try not to give them your back. 
</P>

<P>
Most people zone into Sol A, go down the long spindly stairs (DO NOT fall into 
the lava!), then go through the &quot;window&quot; at the bottom.  After going 
thru the window, you go right and follow along until you pass under a small 
bridge.  You will drop down and see a ramp leading down, with two ledges on 
either side.  At the bottom of the ramp is a room with some kobold hide carpets 
on the floor, and a tunnel off to the right.  You need to memorize, and I mean 
memorize the route to that tunnel because it is the zone to Sol B and when a 
train comes you need to HAUL ASS into that tunnel and zone to Sol B.  DO NOT try 
to make the zone to Lavastorm; you will either get hung up in the window (it's 
tricky to get thru sometimes; especially so when a few Inferno goblins are 
backstabbing you for high 60s) or you will fall off the spindly stairs into the 
lava.  Just bail to Sol B.  DO NOT venture away from the zone in Sol B though. 
It's dangerous in there. 
</P>

<P>
Most people pull to the area around the bridge you passed under, to the area 
before the ramp, or down to the last room before Sol B.  Any of these is fine, 
and there is never a shortage of goblins to fight.  You can pull them from up 
near the window area.  Look around, you will notice quickly where they spawn and 
develop a pulling routine that suits you and your group.
</P>

<H3>Elsewhere</H3>

<P>
I've just entered the low 20s myself, and this has been the extent of my hunting 
thus far.  I am planning trips to several other places soon, namely Unrest, 
Mistmoore, and Cazic Thule, and I will update this guide once I've hunted those 
places for a while.  In the meantime, have fun, and if you play on Xegony, and 
notice I'm on and need a group, give me a /tell. :)
