<P>
We are without doubt the most powerful warriors that roam the lands. A well played DESK can consistently kill in a duel all other player classes, however we are not meat-head tanks nor are we weak finger-waggling spell-chuckers, to play an SK well requires skill and guile. Learning from other Shadow Knights is the best way to make sure you stay one step ahead and without a doubt your first stop for information should be the highly regarded Knight Watch (<A HREF="http://eqforge.com/shadowknight/">http://eqforge.com/shadowknight/</A>). We are a tight and closely knit bunch united by the difficulites of playing an SK, ensure you continue this tradition.
</P>

<H4>Starting Stats</H4>

<P>
For a Tier Dal Shadow Knight there are two or perhaps three stats that you should improve when creating your character. Put as many points as you can into Strength, later in life this will govern how much damage you can do and as a tank (warrior) this is vitally important. With your remaining points either put them in Intelligence to increase your mana pool or Dexterity to increase the number of times weapons with an effect will Proc (go off). I would not recommend you put any points at all into any other attribute; Wisdom - we are not wisdom based casters; Stamina - later in life the majority of our darkforged armour carries +Sta modifiers, Charisma - No-one likes us - live with it, Agility - naturally high for a Tier Dal don't bother.
</P>

<P>
Once you've modified your stats, picked a face and choosen a name you're ready to play. Print out a decent map of Neriak before you enter it for the first time - I still see many a young Tier Dal lost in our complex city. I recommend <A HREF="http://www.eqmaps.com">www.eqmaps.com</A>.
</P>

<P>
Once you've visited "The Lodge of the Dead" and handed in your guild note it's time to start spreading some hate. Although before you head into Nekulos Forest it's worth hailing all the NPCs in our lodge some will give you worthwhile quests. Questing in Everquest can be a difficult thing, requiring key words to be correctly spelt (or misspelt) and capitalised. If you get stuck I recommend you check out <A HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">everquest.allakhazam.com</A> for some hints.
</P>

<H4>Fighting</H4>

<P>
A good Shadow Knight will keep all combat skills maxed as there are all sorts of very good reasons why. 2HS allows us to do the most physical damage but 1HS and maxed Bash with a shield is far far more effective against casting and especially healing monsters. From about level 25 onwards you'll probably be fighting in Cazic Thule, questing for your armour. Cazic is awash with healing Lizards and there are few things as frustrating and occasionally dangerous as beating a Judicator down to near death for it to heal itself because you were unable to stun it with a well-timed bash.
</P>

<P>
Piercing is also worth keeping maxed because these typically low delay weapons strike more often increasing interrupt and proc chances. A Bloodclaw stilleto (<A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/items/items.asp?mode=showIID=4956">http://www.everlore.com/items/items.asp?mode=showIID=4956</A>) can be a devasting weapon for a shadowknight when combined with Vampiric Embrace and a shield. There is even a school of thought that says keep 1HB maxed because one of the best pre-planes weapon is a mace (<A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/items/items.asp?mode=showIID=8522">http://www.everlore.com/items/items.asp?mode=showIID=8522</A>) and keep 2HB maxed because one of our class-specific weapons is 2HB but with an amazing +15sv vs Magic (<A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/items/items.asp?mode=showIID=45107">http://www.everlore.com/items/items.asp?mode=showIID=45107</A>) - which makes it an ideal  pulling weapon.
</P>

<P>
Not keeping these maxed and then trying to max them later is very difficult and embarassing as you miss swing after swing with a weapon. A feeling I have and this is not proven is that if you let a skill slip more than 20 points below the maximum for the level you can have a very hard time raising it, especially as they only improve when fighting monsters that /con blue.
</P>

<H4>Combat Skills</H4>

<P><STRONG>Taunt</STRONG></P>

<P>
It's our primary job. It's as simple as that. At the higher levels (pre-planes) we are not really in a party to inflict vast amounts of damage - sure every little helps - but we are in party to take huge amounts of damage as we have the AC and the HP. To do this we need to ensure that the mobs stick to us and doesn't start tearing into the casters hence we need to remain top of a mobs hate list.
</P>

<P>There are 3 tools that help us do this...</P>

<P>Weapon Damage - often not enough when a caster can nuke for far more</P>
<P>Spell Damage - Some of our DOTs have a good taunt factor</P>
<P>Taunt Skill - So keep it maxed</P>

<P>
If you keep your casters safe chances are you'll win the day. I have lost count of the number of times in a fight I've been down to my last few hit points and been thinking this is it - I'm surely dead - when a cleric stands up from medd'ing and chucks in the life-saving heal. Had I run I'd have died, had the cleric not been able to sit and med in safety - we'd have died. I cannot stress this enough in my opinion a good tank will go down fighting and taunting hoepfully buying the casters time to squeeze out a heal, cast an evac spell for us all or fire off one last nuke.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Bind Wound</STRONG></P>

<P>
As a tank it is worth ensuring Bind Wound is maxed - befriend a mage and get him to summon some bandages for you or buy some. Not having bandages has cost me a number of avoidable deaths. At the end of a battle with a Damage Over Time (DOT) spell eating into you and your cleric out of mana the only way you might have to save yourself (or an unconcious party member) is to slap on a or two bandage. If you can't afford to do this when young, wait until you're a bit older and buy lots of bandages and go throw yourself repeatedly off a cliff, bind those wounds and repeat. Better to do it in a controlled way like that then try and do it when you really need it.
</P>

<P><STRONG>Harm Touch</STRONG></P>

<P>
Don't be shy about using this it resets every 45 minutes and you might as well use it. It has a variety of uses not just to save your life when the mob has the upper hand. It can act as mega-taunt distracting a montser from some weakly armoured caster and back to you. A well timed HT can kill a monster that is healing itself, or stop someone kill-stealing that monster from you or even interrupt a Paladins Lay On Hands in a duel *evil grin*.
</P>

<P>That covers the basics, if you come to Bristlebane, give me a tell ingame.</P>
