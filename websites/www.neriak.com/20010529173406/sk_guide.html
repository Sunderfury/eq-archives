<p>This guide is a comprehensive guide to each different step to the life of a dark elven Shadowknight that will grow as the life of Jyhad, a shadowknight himself, grows.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a young dark elf's journey, it should be known that it is not going to be an easy road, by far. But, the wealth of glory, self fulfillment, and power is a goal that is well worth the struggle.</p>

<p>The initial creation of making a dark elf shadowknight is a crucial one. Statistics do not change during the course of a character's life. They are completely locked. The only things that can change them are due to items. A dark elf is inherently intelligent, but weaker than the other races by a small margin. It is best to beef up strength and stamina a good bit at character creation.</p>

<p>Now, once you begin your life as a shadowknight, you must realize that until ninth level is achieved, you are essentially a warrior with Harm Touch. Harm Touch, however, is a unique ability to the shadowknight class. It does a good deal of damage, and should be used as a last ditch ability when you are probably going to lose a fight.</p>

<p>Since the shadowknight is not yet a magic-caster, he/she should work on weapon skills, and some ability skills. The choice of what weapon to be used is mostly up to the player. However, it is recommended to use two-handed slashing weapon skill. This is because of the Dark Reaver, a weapon that should be used later on (it cost approx. 1000pp at the time of this writing). It is the pinnacle of any shadowknight's arsenal. 

<p>During battles, you should try to keep the skills Taunt and Sense Heading maxed out (they have a maximum level depending on your character level). Taunt can only be used in a fight, but Sense Heading can be used at any time.<p>

<p>Taunt is what makes a shadowknight so sought after by groups when they get high in level. They are casters later on, as well as highly formidable tanks. The Taunt skill makes a targeted creature want to attack you, therefore letting off of the magic casters in a battle.</p>

<p>For equipment, a shadowknight needs to get a good set of armor as soon as possible. A good idea for a player that is not going to get <a href="twink.html">"twinked"</a>, is to have a secondary character as a tailor, or even have the shadowknight as the tailor. At lower levels, the shadowknight can gain experience from fighting black wolves, as well as finding ruined pelts. These, with a sewing kit, and a pattern, can make <a href="tailor.html">Patchwork Armor</a>. This is a good way to initially clothe the shadowknight as it saves money for a good set of armor later on, and also gives initial protection.</p>

<p>As said earlier, the weapon skill is up to the player. However, it is recommended to use the two-handed slashing skill. If the shadowknight can obtain a Bone Bladed Claymore, he/she will not need another weapon until a Dark Reaver can be bought. A Bone Bladed Claymore (BBC=abbreviation) cost approx. 100pp.</p>

<p>Also, a shadowknight should try to purchase one to three backpacks as soon as possible. They range from six to seven gold pieces, depending on the vendor. This allows for more inventory slots for loot so the shadowknight doesn't have to run back to Neriak everytime he/she gets full.<p>

<p>For food supplies, the best to purchase are muffins and milk. Muffins can be bought at the bakery on the human side of the Foreign Quarter. Milk can be purchased at the ogre side of the Foreign Quarter, as well as a small store next to the bank, underground, in the Neriak Commons. The sell for about 6 copper for each. Always have enough food on your shadowknight.</p>

<p>Lastly, when fighting decaying skeletons, and then skeletons, remember to always take the bone chips. You will, for one, need them at level 9 for the Leering Corpse spell. The main reason is that necromancers pay about 2pp per 20-stack of bone chips. If you store enough of them in your bank, you could even sell 100 bone chips for more than 10pp since you can sell a lot at once.</p>

<p>Once 9th level is achieved, you should immediately obtain the spells allowed. They are all about one gold piece in cost, so they are not very expensive. The three best spells to have at 9th level are Leering Corpse (pet skeleton spell), LifeTap (damaging/healing spell) and Siphon Strength. These are very good offensive spells, even though they are weak compared to a pure caster's spell pool.</p>
