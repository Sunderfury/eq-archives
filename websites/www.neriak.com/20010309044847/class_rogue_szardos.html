Going Rogue: The Path of Freedom
</P>

<P>
So you wish to go Rogue, do you?  I applaud you, my friend.  You choose a 
life far more interesting than any other in all of Norrath. I must warn you, 
though.  This is not a career for the faint of heart, nor for the impatient.  
You will encounter great frustration as you proceed along your way.  You 
cannot cast spells and you will never have the hit points to absorb damage as 
well as warriors or hybrid classes.  These facts are incontrovertible.  So, 
if you cannot bear to be manaless among the spellcasters, or if your envy of 
a warrior's strength and armor is insupportable, then I suggest that you stop 
reading this humble monograph right now.  There are several other careers 
available to you, and I am sure their guilds will welcome you with open arms. 
On the other hand, if you have the intelligence to know that speed and skill 
can overcome meat and muscle, and craft to know that a spellcaster given no 
opportunity to cast is usually one very dead spellcaster, then perhaps you 
have what it takes to be a Rogue.  The choice is yours.
</P>

<P>
Still here?
</P>

<P>
Excellent.  I knew you had greatness within you.  Know that you are about to 
embark on the most challenging of careers, and the most enjoyable to 
roleplay.  No other class gives you the chance to act as over the top as a 
Rogue can.  Why?  Attend me as we examine the word itself: Rogue.  It can be 
construed negatively, as a blackguard or a villain of deepest dye, or it can 
simply mean one who lives outside Rules.  An out-law, if you will.  Rogues 
count within their number stealthy thieves, taciturn assassins, dashing 
swashbucklers, graceful cat-burglars, and avenging aristocrats.  Good, evil, 
amoral ... it matters not.  We can be all three at once if we wish.  After 
all, we as Rogues make our own rules and devilry take anyone who disputes 
them.  There is no end to the many ways you can interpret this character.  
This is our advantage, insofar as sheer roleplaying is concerned.
</P>

<P>
As far as playability is concerned, you are already aware of our weaknesses.  
Now let me show you a few of our strengths:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>We have the most devastating attack in the game: Backstab.  No other 
single attack in the game does as much damage. </LI>
<LI>We on average have higher agility than any other class, making us awfully 
hard to hit.</LI>
<LI>We on average have higher dexterity than any other class, so we hit more 
often and we learn our combat and roguely skills very, very fast indeed.</LI>
<LI>We possess an ability (Sneak/Hide) which provides us with mobile 
invisibility (even to undead) when we wish it.</LI>
<LI>We can learn how to jump from tall cliffs and laugh when we touch lightly 
on the ground, damage-free.</LI>
<LI>We can learn nearly every combat skill that warriors can, and even 
surpass them in a few of  them.</LI>
<LI>Picking pockets means never having to say you're insolvent.</LI>
<LI>Sneak means never being turned down by a merchant.</LI>
<LI>One word: Poison.</LI>
<LI>Recipe for a killing machine: dual wield, double attack, disarm and 
riposte.  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
Hmmn.  I can see the gleam growing in your eyes, as I knew it would.  
</P>


<P>
Starting Out
</P>

<P>
As I am Tier`Dal, so is this monograph is written from that perspective.  
Other races may peruse this tome if they wish and mayhap find wisdom in it, 
but it really offers more to benefit my own glorious race than any other.  So.
</P>


<P>
On Starting Stats
</P>

<P>
There have been far too many words written on this subject than can be 
counted.  I say but this:  Teir`Dal begin with 100 agility, high wisdom and 
the highest intelligence of any roguely race at 99.  Add to them if you wish, 
but your precious few bonus points are better used in raising your already 
high dexterity and your unfortunately low strength.  A strength of less than 
70 is suicidal, as is a dexterity of less than 90.  Yes, there are items that 
raise attributes, but it will be some time before you acquire them.  Be 
intelligent.  
</P>

<P>
On Religion
</P>

<P>
For Teir`Dal, the choice is but three: Agnostic, Bristlebane, or Innoruuk.  
If you wish to be able to enter cities other than evil cities and not be KOS, 
Agnostic or Bristlebane is the choice for you.  Agnostic provides the 
greatest freedom, roleplayingwise: with it you can behave anyway you wish ... 
good, evil, or indifferent.  Still, keep a close eye on the faction you 
accumulate over time, good and bad.
</P>

<P>
Your First Steps
</P>

<P>
Before you take a single step, go to Options, specifically keyboard commands, 
and change the keyboard command for launching autoattack from 'a' to 
anything else.  Preferably a number or key you would never use in 
conversation.  I cannot tell you how many bodies I see every evening lying 
next to NPCs simply because their foolish owners failed to depress the 
spacebar to initiate the communication screen and typed an 'a' in the course 
of their conversation, unintentionally attacking the NPC, who then promptly 
sliced and diced them into an early grave.  So do it now, will you?  Good.  
Now you can proceed in relative safety to our beloved guild, the Ebon Mask, 
and deliver your precious guild note.  
</P>

<P>
Right, then.  You have delivered your guild note to the guildmaster and 
equipped your pathetic, crafted-by-the-lowest-bidder dagger. Congratulations, 
youngling.  You are officially a Rogue.  Now benefit by a little inside 
information.  You have but eight slots for equipment, and three of them are 
now occupied by food, drink, and your PvP book (bank or destroy the book, it 
is your choice).  You need room for the items you will acquire here and 
there.  To wit, you need containers.  Backpacks are expensive, especially to 
you, the copperless.  What to do?  Well, Hekzin G`Zule at the Rogue Guild in 
Neriak provides a free six-slot bag for small items and an easy quest for a 
light shield that can be worn as back armor as well.  Even when you complete 
the quest you can offer to do it again and get that same free bag from him.  
Isn't that rather sporting of the old boy?  Moreover, the Necromancer guild 
also offers a quest that provides you a free box, and you need not be a 
necromancer to get it.  Take it. 
</P>

<P>
On Training Points
</P>

<P>
Between your high intelligence and your high dexterity, a Tier`Dal Rogue 
learns skills at a phenomenal rate.  I would advise saving your training 
points for trade skills or learning the basics of new skills.  You will pick 
up Piercing and the rest quickly, without the need for training, and you will 
appreciate these extra points when backstab (a skill that goes up very slowly 
indeed) comes around.
</P>

<P>
On Newbie Hunting (Levels 1-3)
</P>

<P>
Ready yourself, youngling.  It is time to go to Nektulos to earn your keep.  
If you are unfamiliar with our shadowy forest, then for the love of 
Bristlebane, stay close to the roads.  You will die very often at this stage 
and it is best that you do so in a location you can find easily.  Other 
players have lives, and better things to do than to help you find your 
corpse.  Remember to /con everything.  Your prey at this level consist of 
moss snakes, black wolves and decaying skeletons.  Later, you may advance to 
fire beetles and spiderlings.  These last two creatures tend to swarm in 
groups, so do not be surprised if you find yourself running back to Neriak 
with three or four of these beasties in hot pursuit.
</P>

<P>
On What To Do With Your New Income
</P>

<P>
Well now.  You've killed twenty or more snakes, gotten rusty weapons from 
decaying skeletons, looted the odd beastie that others have killed and left 
behind and actually made a gold piece or two.  Applause.  You are now 
solvent.  What will you do with these newfound riches?  Forget food and 
drink.  You have that aplenty until level Four.  What then?  Well,  permit me 
to make the following recommendations: (1) buy patchwork armor: other players 
usually sell it for a gold or three per piece.  It will protect you well 
until you can afford a piece or two of banded armor, which usually sells at 
about a platinum per armor class point.  I consider leather and chainmail to 
be a waste of money, as a full set of patchwork is quite adequate until 
banded armor becomes possible; (2) buy a giant snake fang: the merchants will 
gouge you mercilessly for one, but a player can sell you one for roughly 5 
gold.  This is the best early-stage piercing weapon you can have, and it will 
serve you well indeed up to at about level 10, giving you time to save for 
banded armor and other items; (3) buy shuriken at the Rogue Guild: at only 1 
silver 1 copper apiece, they are quite inexpensive, and an excellent way to 
increase your throwing skill; (4) save for a bow: archery can also be a 
valuable skill.  The Bleek Fletcher sells longbows for about 4 platinum, so 
this is definitely a later level item.  Arrows are very cheap at about 8 
copper apiece.  Quivers, on the other hand, are expensive and useless.   
Forget them.
</P>

<P>
Ah, a small note about food and drink.  At level Four, it no longer 
regenerates along with your body after death.  This means you now have to buy 
sustenance.  For some reason, all food and drink appear to last more or less 
the same amount of time.  Moreover, no one type of food or drink appears to 
provide a benefit greater than any other variety.  What does this mean to 
you?  Simply that you can buy the cheapest food and drink available (namely 
muffins and milk) and survive quite well on this humble fare rather than 
spend hard-won money on more expensive comestibles (such as iron rations).
</P>

<P>
On Combat Skills
</P>

<P>
Let me provide a quick overview of these, our fighting abilities, and note 
well that all combat skills will rise if used against creatures that /con 
blue or better (not green):
</P>

<P>
Piercing: Our primary attack.  Practice it often, for it is the basis of 
backstabbing.  You will find it maxes quickly, leading you to explore other 
combat skills such as
</P>

<P>
1HSlashing:  Why practice it?  There are many wonderful weapons of this type 
to be found in Norrath.  They do excellent damage, often weigh little and 
have devastating magical abilities.  When you have reached the stage where 
you can use a weapon in each hand, this skill will become very important to 
you, as may
</P>

<P>
1HBlunt:  All right, most of the blunt weapons in Norrath are heavy (not good 
for we who must travel light), but there a few worth having and using as 
well.  Besides, we are weapon masters, are we not?  Why possess a skill and 
not be able to use it?
</P>

<P>
Hand2Hand: Useless you say?  Wait until you die after reaching level 4 and 
find yourself naked and unarmed with a skeleton or two blocking the way to 
your corpse ... a corpse too far away to summon, and the clock is ticking.  
No doubt there are those who will tell me that I waste my time practicing 
this skill but, again, if all of your other skills are maxed, why not work on 
this one?  We are renaissance men and women, after all.  I must note that I 
find that this skill does goes up very far.  While other combat skills 
usually have level limits of level x 5 +5 for us, this one appears to work at 
level x 3 +3, or so it operates for me.  I find that most odd.
</P>

<P>
Throwing: What do non-caster classes like us hate most about casters?  How 
with one spell, they pull away the very prey we are running hard at to engage 
ourselves.  Stop grinding your teeth to powder.  Even the odds on these 
anorexic fingertwaddlers by learning projectile weapons.  At the first three 
levels, a shuriken thrown at any prey you select will pull it to you and 
possibly raise your skill, maxing your throwing ability very early in the 
game.  Shuriken and knives are cheap and found in the Rogue Guild.  Buy them. 
Use them. Remember that we are better at this than warriors and monks, and 
can do critical damage when throwing them at an unprotected back at Level 12. 
Another thing worth knowing about shuriken and throwing knives: They are 
very light, and can be equipped with 20 in the range weapon slot and 20 in 
the ammo slot; 40 shots in all.  A nice number indeed for the weight and the 
money.
</P>

<P>
Archery: See Throwing, above, and add a much longer range to your damage and 
pulling ability.  The problem with archery is that bows are expensive, 
damnably heavy, and we do not get the critical hit ability when using them 
(that is the ranger's province).
</P>

<P>
Dodge (Available at Level 4):  Your first line of defense.  Put a point into 
it and watch it go up on its own, as you become harder and harder to hit.
</P>

<P>
Backstab(Available at Level 10): Our Great Weapon.  This attack can only be 
available if you have a piercing weapon in your primary hand.  Skill in it 
goes up very, very slowly.  If you have training points to spare, I suggest 
you raise it to skill level 21 (Very Bad).  Life is easier that way.  This 
attack does more damage than any other attack in the game.  If I may quote 
from the esteemed author Steven Brust (a true Rogue if ever there was one) , '
no matter how subtle the wizard, a knife between the shoulder blades will 
seriously cramp his style.'  Indeed it will, often causing his spell to be 
interrupted, and allowing you to put him out of his misery. Done from the 
front, backstab counts as an extra attack, doing less damage but coming in 
handy indeed.  I must note that if you have not been doing so, now is the 
time to start grouping.  It is the best way to raise this skill, as your 
comrades will provide many opportunities to find unprotected backs upon which 
to practice.
</P>

<P>
Parry (available at Level 12): Your second line of defense.  Put a point into 
it and watch it go up by itself, like Dodge.
</P>

<P>
Dual Wield (Available at Level 13):  Go sell your Dark Shield of Ebon.  You 
are now doubly dangerous, and anyone who looks at you now knows it. Put a 
point into this skill and let it rise on its own.  If you want it to be most 
effective, put a weapon with the shortest delay in the off-hand.  To raise 
non-piercing weapon skills, equip a non-piercing weapon in the off-hand.  
Enjoy.
</P>

<P>
Double Attack (Available at Level 16): You are well on your way to becoming 
walking death.  A point is all you need to start this valuable skill moving.
</P>

<P>
Disarm (Available at 27):  This is why others are loath to duel with us.  We 
get this skill early on, and find great satisfaction in sending an opponent's 
magic sword winging gracefully away while we grin and finish him off.  Note 
that this is also a skill that can be improved against beasties that /con 
green.  Give an orc pawn a sword and practice.
</P>

<P>
Riposte (Available at Level 30):  A single point starts this skill, which 
provides an extra attack following a block.  Ouch.
</P>

<P>
On Rogue Skills
</P>

<P>
Sneak:  The skill by which we are known.  While merchants may refuse to trade 
with others, a rogue may prevail.  Merely sneak and approach the merchant 
from the side or the back.  Trade as usual, as successfully sneaking rogues 
/con indifferent to most opponents and NPCs.  Finished trading?  Good.  Now 
smile winningly at the Shadowknight who was told by the innkeeper to get 
stuffed.
</P>

<P>
Hide:  We Teir`Dal are naturally able to do this, and begin at skill level 50 
(Below Average).  Listen carefully: First, successfully hide, then select 
sneak.  If you sneak successfully as well, then you have just engaged in 
Rogue invisibility.  Hide/Sneak provides you with invisibility to creatures, 
other players and to the undead.  You can move like this, but very slowly.  
Be warned.  There are some spells and creatures that see through it, but you 
may generally feel safe.  Here is a valuable tip: have a shaman bless you 
with Spirit of the Wolf, and then Hide/Sneak.  You may now move invisibly at 
almost full running speed.  Nice, eh?  Hide is also the basis for the new 
Rogue-only Evade skill.  If in combat, a Rogue may turn off autoattack, 
target his beastie opponent and select Hide.  If successful, the beastie 
forgets the Rogue for a moment, giving her an opportunity to run, disappear, 
... or backstab.
</P>

<P>
Pick Lock (Available at Level 6):  A roguely skill, to be sure, but one 
underused until now.  Once, there were perhaps 9 pickable doors in all of 
Norrath.   Kunark has changed that dramatically.  Our skills are in demand 
now, for these dangerous new dungeons. When this skill becomes available, put 
points into it until it grows to 11 (Feeble).  When you are ready to go to 
the dungeon of Befallen, buy lockpicks, and try your hand at the locked doors 
there.  To pick a locked door, click on the lockpicks.  They will attach 
themselves to your cursor.  Then click the picks onto the door.  If it works, 
you will receive a message and you can open the door. Do so, close it again, 
and pick it anew.  It will be time-consuming, but worth it as you slowly max 
the skill.
</P>

<P>
Pick Pocket (Available at Level 7):  We suffer much by this skill, 
reputationwise.  Other classes often do not group with us because they fear 
we will diminish any profit from beasties killed by fleecing them while we 
fight them.  They are not wholly mistaken.  We are capable of doing just 
that.  Some Rogues actually do it on a regular basis.  By doing so, these 
idiots cause problems for all of us, and violate an unspoken commandment: 
Never treat your friends like marks.  If you are soloing, ... by all means do 
it.  Warning: failure may result in being attacked by your target, so choose 
your prey wisely.  Also, you cannot attack and pick pockets at the same time. 
Simply put, you must attack, stop attacking, pick pockets, and attack again. 
Your best suckers (er, training partners) in the beginning are those stunted 
green orc pawns in the Commonlands (animals and undead have no pockets to 
pick).  This skill goes up even when they /con green to you, so target one, 
select pick pocket and practice away.  Be prepared to call off other players 
who try to 'rescue' you from your sucker (er, attacker).  A hotkey with &quot;I'm 
practicing pickpocket, BACK OFF,&quot; can help.  Not always, though.  There will 
still be killstealing morons who will later claim they did not see it, even 
if you flashed it six times in a row.
</P>

<P>
Sense Traps (Available at Level 8):  Feh.  Useless now, perhaps not in time.
</P>

<P>
Safe Fall (Available at Level 12):  Listen.  Can you hear Bristlebane's 
laughter?  How he loves us so, to provide us with this skill. We are second 
only to monks in its use, and is an invaluable survival tool.  Put a point 
into in and find a steep slope or balcony.  The Neriak commons has several 
multistory buildings upon which to practice.  Jump off a balcony.  Did you 
take damage?  Do it again, and again.  You will see your skill rise and your 
damage decrease, until you take no damage at all.  Then find something 
steeper and do it again.  Eventually, you will be able to do a backflip off a 
treetop in Kelethin and land deftly upon your uninjured feet, grinning at the 
open-jawed stares of the treehugging mongrels who reside there.  This skill 
serves as a weapon as well.  A rogue jumping off a cliff can cause damage to 
or even kill outright a pursuer who is stupid enough to follow him down.  
There it is again.  Bristlebane's laughter.  Infectious, isn't it?
</P>

<P>
Apply Poison (Available at Level 18):  Poison is an edge we have over others. 
Use it.  Live it.
</P>

<P>
Disarm Traps (Available at Level 20):  See Sense Traps, above.
</P>

<P>
Make Poison (Available at Level 20):  Very expensive and time-consuming.  
Mayhap that is why we receive this skill at a time when money should not be a 
problem anymore.  Other tomes have more information on this subject than I.  
Acquire them by whatever means available (you are Rogues, after all) and 
study them.
</P>

<P>
Instill Doubt (Available at Level 22):  Alas, I have yet to explore this 
skill, but it warms my heart to know that our reputations and subtle 
fearsomeness can be such that beasties will break off and run away in terror 
rather than fight us.
</P>

<P>
On Other Skills
</P>

<P>
Bind Wound:  The Rogue's best friend when combat is over.  We have no healing 
spells of our own, and caster companions can run out of mana.  The best Rogue 
is the one who can rely on himself alone to survive if need be.  With this 
skill, a Rogue can heal up to half of his total hit points.  Bandages are 
required to use this skill.  Buy them (I like keeping at least 20 on my 
person at any time) . This skill can only be used if you are below 50% of 
your hit points (and not being attacked).  You then target yourself and 
select Bind Wound.  Once bandaged, your hit points go up.  I like to hide 
before I do this, to protect myself in this most vulnerable state.  Bind 
Wound is more valuable as you increase in skill, as each bandage restores 1 
point for every 4 levels of skill.  At skill 100, a single bandage heals 25 
hit points.   Also, if a comrade is lying down, bleeding to death, a single 
bandage from you will stop the bleeding and prevent him or her from dying.  
Now do you see how important this skill is?
</P>

<P>
Swimming:  Must I really explain why you should learn this?  Suffice to say, 
the grotto in the commons where the Priest of Discord resides is an ideal 
locale within which to practice swimming.
</P>

<P>
On Trade Skills
</P>

<P>
I shall confine this section to my personal observations on three specific 
trade skills: tailoring, brewing and smithing.
</P>

<P>
In Neriak, tailoring is easily the most fruitful trade for the least amount 
of investment.  A small sewing kit costs only a few gold and patterns run 
slightly over 5 silver each.  We are blessed with an area with the greatest 
natural resources for tailoring: Nektulos Forest.  The forest abounds with 
wolves, dropping ruined pelts which can be tailored into small patchwork 
armor, and bears which drop pelts which can be tailored into large patchwork 
armor ... or better.  You see, the bears also (albeit rarely) drop medium 
quality or high quality bear pelts, which can be crafted into better grade 
large armor or backpacks.  Tailor-made backpacks have a 10-slot carrying 
capacity and can be sold for quite a lot of platinum.  Large spiders also 
roam here, dropping spider silk which can be tailored into silk swatches, 
which in turn can be tailored into spellcaster-worn raw silk armor or the 
cured silk armor sought by monks.  Certain armor will require a large sewing 
kit.  The nearest location to purchase such a kit is at an inn in Northern 
Ro, just past Freeport.  A fourth level enchanter with illusion spells can 
obtain one with ease for you, but an experienced rogue can sneak his way 
there and get it himself.  It is a fine investment for slightly over a 
platinum piece, as it can also be used as a backpack.  It has the same 8-slot 
carrying capacity, and it is considerably lighter.
</P>

<P>
Brewing can provide a small influx of funds in a pinch and, combined with 
tailoring, can lead to making cured silk armor.  Are you bored with killing 
snakes?  Don't be.  Snake scales, combined with a flask of water and a bottle 
in a still (located in the lower level of the Blind Fish in the Neriak 
Commons) can make bog juice, a noxious drink which can be sold for some 
silver, or quaffed to increase alcohol tolerance.  With minimal costs, one 
can go from skill level 0-21 just by making bog juice.  From then on, it is 
not very difficult to make heady kiolas, a component of cured silk armor.
</P>

<P>
Smithing.  Sigh.  I did it as well.  A mistake if ever there was one.  The 
time and money spent on learning smithing are not worth it, in my opinion.  
There are numerous smiths in Neriak and Freeport selling banded armor for a 
platinum per armor class point.  Don't waste what could be over a month of 
your life and a thousand platinum to learn to do the same.  In later years, 
when time and money do not matter to you, by all means do it.  By then, 
smithing may be updated so one may craft superior armor or weapons.  Not now.
</P>

<P>
On Grouping and Soloing
</P>

<P>
We are, with the exception of Bards, the best class in the game insofar as 
grouping is concerned.  With our Hide/Sneak ability, we are matchless scouts 
and corpse-retrievers extraordinary, going where others cannot.  We pull 
beautifully, and our backstabbing and superior combat abilities make us 
marvellous auxiliary tanks.  Post-Kunark, our lockpicking skills make us very 
much in demand. Remember these your strengths and utilize them.  Of course, 
there are a few &quot;don't&quot; to remember as well.  Don't pickpocket from your 
group's beasties; if you must practice the skill, announce it to the group 
and agree on picking a single beastie for that purpose. Otherwise, you'll 
likely lose friends and find it hard to group in future.  Do not become the 
tank; you can tank in a pinch, but you cannot serve as such on a regular 
basis.  You simply do not have the strength and hit points to do it well.  
Remember that backstab is useless if you cannot get to a back.  Have your 
party members always leave you room to maneuver AND NOT TO ATTACK THE BEASTIE 
EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE ATTACKING THE BEASTIE.  You would be surprised how 
stupid people get in battle and forget that the best strategy is that they 
should attack and taunt from the front of the beastie, while you backstab and 
attack from the rear of the beastie, causing it to turn constantly in pain 
and confusion until it becomes extremely dead.
</P>

<P>
Soloing is not impossible for a Rogue, but it is very slow going, and not to 
be recommended after a certain level.  As one who only began grouping around 
the middle of level 9, I can offer Solitaire Rogues a bit of advice.  You 
should keep at least 20 bandages on you at all times, because you are going 
to need them.  You should also carry some kind of projectile weapons for 
pulling beasties, like shuriken or knives.  Remember to travel light; weight 
is one of your worst enemies, as it ruins your hit-avoiding agility rating. 
Hmmn.  A final note would be to choose your prey carefully: Blues will 
provide good experience and permit skill level increases. Avoid greens (since 
they provide little or no experience) unless they drop something you want, 
like bone chips.   Some beasties swarm, like skeletons, so try to keep a back 
door (knowing where the zone entrance is, for example) open.  Oh, and before 
I forget: should you need help, use /yell, not /shout.  While the /shout 
command is heard throughout the entire zone, it does not tell anyone where 
you are.  The /yell command, while more local, does provide directions.  Time 
is of the essence in yelling for help: Play it smart and make a hotkey for it.
</P>

<P>
On Etiquette
</P>

<P>
Yes, etiquette.  Rogues we are, but we are not barbarians.  Well, some are, 
... or it that the other way around?  Either way, that's neither here nor 
there ...   
</P>

<P>
I shall begin with a small word about inspecting people.  We are all 
devastatingly good-looking.  This is our blessing as Teir`Dal. Naturally, 
there are many of us who have never seen certain varieties of armor before, 
and are curious about it.  We see others in such armor and, without thinking, 
inspect them without asking permission.  This is rude.  I know of one player 
who has a hot key which reads &quot;---- slaps away your grubby fingers from his 
equipment.&quot;  A trifle strong, perhaps, but effective.  Also, do not ask to 
buy or trade for what someone is wearing or carrying.  We do not have the 
legend &quot;For Sale&quot; engraved upon our chestplates.

One of  the most popular spells in the game is the Spirit of the Wolf.  One 
of the most disgraceful behaviors in the game is how people ask (if not 
actually demand) for someone to cast it on them.  Casters are players, too.  
They have lives of their own and they need their mana to properly lead them.  
They do not exist to serve you.  If you need a &quot;SOW&quot;, even desperately, ASK 
NICELY.  You will get further with a &quot;Noble Shaman, a journey fraught with 
peril awaits me.  Could you bless me with the Wolf's Spirit?&quot; , then with 
the terse &quot;Need SOW.&quot;  Make a hotkey if you're the impatient type.  Thank 
them prettily if they cast it (and do not insult them if they do not).  Offer 
them something if you have anything.  Higher level characters will probably 
refuse to take it, but you will look all the better for it.  This is a group 
oriented game, and isolating people who can help you out is not very bright.  
So why not begin living up to that high TeirâDal intelligence statistic?

Now, a brief word on the loathsome practice of kill stealing.  Listen well.  
If you see a player engaged with a beastie ... even if that player is down to 
one bubble, DO NOT ENGAGE THE BEASTIE WITHOUT ASKING PERMISSION.  I do not 
care if the player is fighting six beasties at once.  I do not care if the 
player is being attacked by a single beastie and not moving (she may be 
practicing pickpocketing).  ASK PERMISSION.  A simple, &quot;Need Help?&quot; is 
sufficient.  If the player says yes, take the beastie (or beasties, as the 
case may be) down.  If the player is AFK (away from keyboard) a tell will 
reveal that to you.  If you engage without permission and the player says or 
tells you to back off, then BACK OFF.  I realize things in the heat of battle 
are excitable and tricky, but surely you can read a screen.  If you cannot, 
then I have no idea how an illiterate such as yourself managed to load the 
game in the first place (and I certainly have no idea how you have made it 
this far in perusing this monograph).  Please heed this final warning: Greed 
is dangerous to the health of your character.   Killstealing leads to a bad 
reputation that will spread like a plague throughout Norrath at the least, 
and a total suspension from the game by the Powers That Be at Verant at the 
most if you get reported by other players often enough.  A kill stealer is 
the lowest form of life.  In fact, the only thing that comes close to being 
as base as being a killstealer ... is being a player-beggar.  Hmmn.  I 
believe that serves as an adequate segueway for a discussion

On Begging
</P>

<P>
The practice of player begging began as an innocuous, rather distasteful 
practice at first, but it has now grown into what can only be considered to 
be an absolute outrage.  I all but explode when a third level player begs me 
incessantly for free magical weapons or platinum.  Platinum yet!  These 
people want a free ride.  I will subsidize neither cowardice nor laziness, 
and neither should you.  
</P>

<P>
Forgive me, but this topic needs attention.  When I first entered Norrath, I 
knew no one, trusted no one, and hence started truly with nothing.  I never, e
ver, begged (it was beneath me as Teir`Dal .... damnation, it was beneath me 
as a sentient being!). Therefore, I killed and still kill countless beasties 
to earn my platinum.  Time-consuming?  Certainly.  Mind-numbing?  Very often. 
But it is honest and honorable and no one can ever think less of me.  Would 
you rather be known by your Norrathian peers as Kragar the Wolfslayer, or 
that whiny loser paladin who begged his way to plate armor?  Bad reputations 
spread like wildfire here.  Those who have earned them find that few, if any, 
will group with them, trade with them or even lift a finger to help them if 
they need it.  This is Norrathian justice.  Harsh, but fair.  We are all 
heroes here. Cowards and sloths should find diversions elsewhere.

Parting Words
</P>

<P>
Well.  We have come the end of our journey, my friends, our glimpse at the 
marvels of life as a Teir`Dal Rogue.  Learn these lessons well, o younglings,
and quickly.  Remember that an ignorant Rogue is not a Rogue for long.  I 
look forward to meeting you in my travels, my brothers and sisters in 
subtlety.  May Bristlebane bless you with merriment and cunning, and let the 
shadows be kind to you all.

My way is Shadow; My ally, Silence; My virtue, Surprise.<BR>
My creed? If you can't be Good, be Elegant.
