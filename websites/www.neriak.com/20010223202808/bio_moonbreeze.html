<P>
Like most people on Norrath, I do not remember the day I was born. I am told that it was a dark night in the even darker city of Neriak, home of the Tier Dal. I am told that my father is, or was, a high ranking necromancer. I say or was because I know not if he still lives. My mother was a cleric of Innoruuk. This is all I know of the family into which I was born.
</P>

<P>
Less than two months after my birth the high elves of Felwithe launched a raid on Neriak. My father was called to battle, my mother to heal the wounded Tier Dal. I was left if the care of a servant. Shortly after the battle entered the inner city our house was taken and my guardian slain. A dagger was put to my throat but at the last minute an order was shouted out and the dagger sheathed. The order came from a high elf noble, one of the leaders of the raid. I was too young, he said, to have been corrupted to Innoruuk's ways. My soul could be saved from the evil that my people embraced. And so I was taken to Felwithe to learn the ways of the Koada Vie.
</P>

<P>
I was soon given a new name, to this day I do not remember my Tier Dal name, to match that of my new older sister. Only where she was called Starbreeze, I would be Moonbreeze. Equally beautiful, but with a darker connotation behind it.
</P>

<P>
And so a Tier Dal came to live within the beautiful city of Felwithe. I was taught in the ways of the Koada Vie. Innoruuk was an evil god, his worshipers to be punished. Necromancy an unforgivable act, punishable by death. Rather ironic I always thought. Only good magic was permitted. Thus I was entered into the school of enchanters, as were my elder sister and mother.
</P>

<P>
For all the years that I lived in Felwithe I lived as they lived, ate what they ate, spoke as they spoke, helped those less fortunate then myself. Still I was not completely accepted. Those whom I would call friend stared from the corners of their eyes when they thought I couldn t see. Parents counseled their children against being alone with me. Adolescents giggled at my dark skin and white hair. Though my father insisted that I be treated no differently than any other I was nonetheless somewhat of an outcast.
</P>

<P>
My curiosity about my people did not help the situation. I was oft given to wonder what was so bad about necromancy or why worship of some gods was forbidden but not others. My father warned me that if I were to continue to show interest in such subjects he would no longer be able to protect me. He might be a respected paladin, but that power only went so far where the protection of a dark elf was concerned. My mother was even less understanding.
</P>

<P>
It finally came to the point where the only people I would talk to for any reason other than sheer necessity were my teacher, father, and Starbreeze. Soon I confided only in Starbreeze. Sometimes to this day I think that she is the only person on the whole of Norrath who truly understands me.
</P>

<P>
Eventually the day came where I could no longer stand the whispers and barely hidden stares. I told my sister that the time had come for me to see what I could of Norrath. She didn t say anything, only smiled sadly and I knew that she understood. My father understood too, however, he had a warning for me: I could explore the world as I chose but if I were ever to set foot within the city of Neriak I could never return to my home in Felwithe. I looked at the floor as I told him that although I may not be able to come home, I had to find out who I really was and what my people were truly like. I was still looking at the floor when he walked away, but I looked up in time to see his eyes fill with tears as he turned to look at me once more before leaving the room. That was the last time I saw my father.
</P>

<P>
That night I packed all that I would take with me. I left before the sun rose the following morning. The last thing I did before leaving was to write a note to my family telling them that I loved them but that this was something I had to do. I can only hope that they understood and have been able to forgive me.
</P>

<P>
My journey to the dark forest of Nektulos took less time than I had expected. I stayed in the human city of Free Port for several days before I made my way through the East Commons and to the forest. Finding the entrance to the city in which I was born, however, took the better part of two days. And that was once I had entered the forest proper.
</P>

<P>
I called Neriak my home through four seasons of training, but was sadly disappointed the whole time. I was no more welcome here than I had been among the Koada Vie. Only within the Tower of the Spurned did I find refuge. Neriak was so different from all that I knew. From all that I had ever known. And where I was not welcome in Felwithe for my dark elven heritage, I was not welcome in Neriak for my high elven upbringing. I had been raised on the words of Tunare and Mithaniel Marr. Now, among my dark brethren, the words of Innoruuk were what I heard daily. I was so young, so new to the world then. I wanted to believe anything they told me, to learn their ways, to be one of them. But changing my ways from Tunare s to Innoruuk's...that was something that I could not do. It was during my time in Neriak that I promised to myself that I would swear my loyalties to no one god.
</P>

<P>
Early in my fourth season in Neriak I decided that though the Tier Dal might be my people in blood, they were not and would never be my people in spirit. I was taught at a young age to help those weaker than myself, they had no pity for the weak. I used magic to create beauty, they created darkness and destruction. Neriak could never be my home. Once again I packed my things and went in search of a place that I could be happy. A place that would be home.
</P>

<P>
I traveled for many bright days and many dark nights. Countless times I thanked all the gods I could think of that my invisibility spell protected me from the eyes of the beasts of Norrath. I walked through forests and plains, over mountains and across rivers. Eventually I came across the human city of Qeynos. I was tired of being on the road so I stayed there, sleeping outside and out of the sight of the guards.
</P>

<P>
For many weeks I ran errands, hunted the vicious gnolls, and brought in the pelts of the diseased wolves and bears that roamed the hills outside the city. After much hard work I won the trust of the humans and half elves in the area. At least for the most part. Where my good deeds fail me, my illusions come through. 
</P>

<P>
I am at home here in Qeynos. For the first time in my life I feel welcome by those around me. There are some stares, of course, but not of hatred or mistrust. People, humans that is, look at me in open wonder and admiration when they come to realize that my heart is not darkened by evil. They smile, wave, and greet me by name.
</P>

<P>
I am truly happy here in Qeynos. Though I miss the beauty of Felwithe, the forest surrounding Neriak, and my family, Starbreeze most of all, I now know that this is where I was always meant to be. Qeynos is my home, now and forever.
