</FONT><HR>I'm curious to get everyone's take on where the line between roleplaying and being a jerk OOC lies.<P>For example, in my opinion, teleporting someone into a dangerous area is in the realm of OOC jerkiness -- it can cause real and serious damage to someone's character, and they may NEVER be able to recover their corpse.   But others think this is fine, and indeed it IS something a real dark elf would do... But on the OOC side it's a really nasty thing to do and could even cause someone to quit the game.<P>Also, doing this sort of thing a lot will pretty much guarantee that when you are ready to do plane and dragon raids, you won't be able to get a group.  People, in general, do not understand roleplaying and just want to "play".<P>What's everyone else's take?<P>------------------<BR>Sevok Celith'ar<BR>Teir'dal Necromancer<BR>Darkmoon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.78.66.223</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>To be honest, how many people actually sit down and consider just to what degree they are roleplaying?<P>Perhaps more than half the population avoids it or is ignorant of it.  They concentrate on the accumulation of items, experience and money, deriving their fun for the game out of a social interaction of hack and slash.  They group with their buddies, they may or may not min-max stats and equipment.  This is easily the largest population percentage block on any of the Everquest servers.<P>Of the remainder, three quarters fall into the semi-roleplayer category.  These are novices for the most part, or those that can't really be bothered to go all out.  They tend to play up some of the politics of Norrath, so long as it's convieniant.  At the slightest problem, they'll drop OOC, and this includes if they get bored.  About half the time, they can't be distinguished from the formentioned non-roleplaying group.  In truth, they are essentially playing themselves immersed within the setting.<P>Maybe five percent of the population forms the roleplayers of Everquest.  Evenly spread through most servers, these are the ones who not only roleplay the politics, animosities and themes of their races, but they seek out to create personalities for their characters and act them out.  This is where the IC evilness and the OOC rudeness gets blurred. The two formentioned groups often can't distinguish between the two.  As roleplayers are a very small minority, these are usually lumped into a 'snobby' or 'jerk' category when other players can't figure them out.  Saddly, many roleplayers get discouraged and cease their habits in favour of gaining levels and loot.<P>The last category of players are the 'True' Roleplayers.  These are the persons that so immerse themselves into the developpement of their PCs that there's seldom a chance to even catch them out of character.  They don't respond to OOC commentaries.  Speaking of levels in terms of experience will get little to no reaction or understanding.  Many are known to shut off all chat filters except for says and tells, thus making them deaf to 99% of the other players, less they stay close.  This even includes group talk and guild talk.  This unfortunatly leaves them isolated.  Finding other roleplayers of their calibre and intensity is hard.  When found, these groups are often very solid, regardless of the levels of experience seperating them.  To the rest of the population, they are usually seen as snobs or sought for their ability, depending on circles.<P>These are the categories as I see them.  To answer the point raised, look at the different groups and you can probably discern who's doing it just because, who's doing it on a whim, and who's doing it because their character would do so.  The majority of players that take these acts are doing so only for reasons printed in the original manual.  They take the animosities for granted and as a written excuse to do harm to other players.<P>The last two groups may actually have it justified within their character's concept.  With their opinions holding little bearing, especially among the 'true' roleplayers, they will act as their PC would act.  Clerics will blind light race dwellers as they run through the lavafields or along the Karanas High Pass.  This isn't necessarily the rule.  For their own reasons, they might be just as likely not to do it for more reasons stipulated by the personality of their character.<P>Unfortunatly, the world will seldom understands the roleplayers and won't ever bother to even sit down and figure it out.  Some roleplayers have thusly gotten cautious, dealing only with those that announce themselves as being in the same category as they.  Again, some turn on the roleplaying tag haphazardly and confuse the issue further.  So little can be done.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.112.88.229</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

Though I think you are being VERY generous with the roleplayer percentages.<P>The problem is that by design, Everquest pits two desires against each other -- the desire to maintain roleplay purity and the desire to be able to experience all of the game.<P>It is, actually, impossible to have both.  <P>Either you go for 100% roleplay purity, and hence not be able to see all of the game; you go for NO roleplaying and miss out on that (IMO) wonderful experience; or you find an acceptable compromise and end up seeing a lot of the game while still mataining some hopefully high degree of roleplaying.<P>For example, my wife and I play two Teir'dal who always travel and adventure together.  In our travels we have met many of light races who have helped us GREATLY.  Thru them, our characters have seen that Innoruuk touches and controls people of all races -- not just the Teir'dal.  So, on one hand we have OOC friends, and on the other hand our characters believe that Innoruuk has controlled these people and forced them to help us.<P><BR>------------------<BR>Sevok Celith'ar<BR>Teir'dal Necromancer<BR>Darkmoon<p>[This message has been edited by Sevok Celith'ar (edited January 31, 2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.78.133.81</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the catagories, and admitedly I am probably more of a group two then a 'true' roleplayer.  Not that I am a novice to roleplaying, I started playing dungeons&dragons back in first edition... about six years ago.  Ive played my share of ORPGs from AOLS Neverwinter Nights to Everquest today Ive been wasting my nights for three years heh.  The one thing about everquest, and I think it was mentioned is that theres so many people that dont roleplay, it makes it difficult for the type two people that like to roleplay but just cant get into it unless everyone else around them is roleplaying, to roleplay.  Its hard to not go out of character when the other 70 people in the zone dont even know what the term in character means, atleast for me it is.<P>I dont know where Im going with this, just my two cents burning time before a plane of fear raid... where Im sure there will be no roleplaying heh.<P>~Sylfein<BR>48 Dark Elf Shadow Knight<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.161.88.232</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

</FONT><HR>On a side note, one thing that Ultima Online had that made it better then everquest in a way was the policy of 'blessing' places that where used for roleplaying.  It helped to bring the people that wanted to roleplay into the same area, which made it easier to roleplay, and when someone that didnt roleplay walked into a tavern full of people roleplaying, it usualy had the effect of encouraging them to roleplay also.  I know on atlantic I spent many nights at the serpent cross tavern east of yew, and had a really great time there.  <P>Not that you need game masters to come in and alter the game to make a mecca for roleplayers to roleplay, but it makes it a lot easier, and a lot more enjoyable to roleplay when your with others that are also roleplaying.  <P>EQ doesnt really have any spots where roleplayers tend to gather in numbers, which I guess is probably due in part to factions and racial hatred and what not, but if there was a place where monsters didnt spawn, and rare loot or quest items couldnt be found, that encouraged a roleplaying atmosphere I think it would help a lot of people that want to roleplay meet with a lot of other people that want to roleplay.  Theres tons of great inns, pubs, bars, homes, guilds, you name it that would be prime spots for people to gather and roleplay, but it just doesnt stick here like it seemed to in ultima, Im not sure why that is.<P>~Sylfein l'Velkyn<BR>48 Shadow Knight<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.161.88.232</font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000002&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000002&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
