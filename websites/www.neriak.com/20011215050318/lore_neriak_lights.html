As told to Zariu

<BR><BR>

<P>
After the wars when Neriak was rebuilding and researching, a young Magician was eagerly experimenting with a new summoning spell.  After searching for the proper reagents and combining them in what they hoped were the correct quantities - they combined them and chanted the proper words with the correct intonation.  When they had returned from the world of trance, they looked down and were surprised to find a blinding light in place of what they hoped would be a Wand of Illumination.  After more experimentation on the subject (for the Mage had forgotten about the Wand and was curious now about the light!) , the young Mage discovered that different lichen would create a different color light.  The light would only last a few scant minutes, and then fade.

<P>
The Magician asked their Necromancer friend about it.  "My friend, can you who are the master of life and death find a way to make the light permanent", for the Magician had hoped to be able to set globes of light around their dwelling for decorative illumination.  The Necromancer thought about this, and upon engaging in some research found a way to preserve the light and make it invincible against Death.

<P>
But they could not make it keep a form, so the Magician and Necromancer visited their friend the Enchanter.  "You who are the master of the illusion, can you give our light a different form", for the light would tend to dissipate into a shapeless mass and spread all over the table when placed there.  The Enchanter started their research into charming the light into staying into a certain form, and succeeded at the task.

<P>
The three Casters had by now a desire to show all of Neriak their creation by paying homage to Neriak, the Teir'dal and their Gods by forming the light into artforms and illuminating parts of the city with it.  None of them had any success in placing the lights anywhere, even with the effort of all 3 of them working together on various spell combinations to place it on a wall.
</P>

<BR>

<P>
All three of them went to their friend Wizard. "You have teleported us around Norrath and have paralyzed monsters where they stand!  We wish to show Neriak what we have created but we cannot permanently place it against a wall or on top of a building - can your skills make this happen?".  The Wizard thought about this for awhile, and came up with a spell to paralyze the light form in place.
</P>

<P>
All four of them were overjoyed at this new light that they had created so they set off to decorate the city.  The Magician created the light, the Necromancer spelled it to remain indefinitely, the Enchanter coaxed the light into different forms and the Wizard placed and froze the light in place.  In time not only did they have tribute to Innoruuk, but they had placed subtle markings so that those born to the city were reminded of where the passage to the city, temples and exits lay.
</P>

<P>
This was done after the vile thief Erud stole knowledge of the magickal arts from the Teir'dal and so this is why Neriak and only Neriak is illuminated by the strange and beautiful lights that appear to be suspended in the air.
