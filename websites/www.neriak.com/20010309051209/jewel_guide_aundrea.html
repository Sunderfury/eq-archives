Okay, so you want to be a jeweler.  Jewelry making can be very lucrative
but also expensive.  I find this skill to be most compatible with
enchanters as they are the only ones that can enchant silver but
technically anyone can make jewelry.  I myself am an enchanter, so keep
in mind that I am speaking from an enchanter's point of view.  It's hard
to get started in it quickly since the initial investment can be
overwhelming.  There are many ways to accomplish this that work
wonderfully, I'm sure.  I'm going to share with you what worked best for
me and hopefully it will work for you too!  I don't know everything about
it yet and learn new tricks all the time so this is going to be geared
more towards someone just thinking about building this skill and getting
started in it.  Over time I'd like to add to this guide for the more
advanced levels.  If you discover any secrets or tricks I don't mention,
feel free to offer suggestions.  This is for YOU, not me.  Okay, enough
of that.  Let's get started!
</P>

<P>
You're aspiring to become a jeweler so what do you need to get started?  
</P>

<P>
The first thing I would recommend is to find a partner.  Find another
player that wants to build his/her skills in making armor.  As
he/she goes up in levels, it will be harder and harder to find pelts and
spider silks.  They will need some help with this.  You may notice a lot
of auctions going out to buy pelts and spider silks.  These are people
that are either getting huge orders or have built up their level so high
they have a hard time getting the proper loot.  You won't be able to
even begin enchanting silver until level 9 but the tailor can start
making patchwork armor almost immediately.  They will be your greatest
ally in raising enough money to get started in your new business.
</P>

<P>
For the next few levels you need to save up all your practice points.
You'll need to start with at least 20 once you reach level 9 to get some
good results.  In the mean time, kill all the Giant Spiders and wolves
you can and give your tailor partner all the silks and pelts.  Once
their skill level is high enough in making patchwork armor they can
start making silk armor and that's where you start reaping the benefits.
Continue to supply your partner with pelts and silks and have them make
all your silk armor for you from the silks they get.  They will be
auctioning off their patchwork and silk armor and believe me, there is a
huge market out there.  They will make quick money and should split
their profits with you.  Some of the patterns they will need won't be in
Neriak and they will need to travel into enemy territory to get them.
Once you reach level 8, you can get several spells that will become very
beneficial to you and your partner.  These are &quot;See Invisible&quot;,
&quot;Invisibility&quot; and &quot;Illusion: Half Elf&quot; and 
&quot;Gate&quot;.  With these spells you'll both be able to travel into EC to 
get the patterns the tailor needs to create a full range of armor.  You first 
cast &quot;See Invisible&quot; on yourself and then &quot;Invisible&quot; on 
your partner.  Cast &quot;Illusion: Half Elf&quot; on yourself and you can go 
with him/her into enemy territory, re-casting invisible when it wears off.  
He/she can give you the money to purchase the patterns and show you where to go.  
The merchants will sell to you since they will think you are Half-Elf and the 
guards won't bother you either.  Other than spells, food, water and tiny daggers 
to summon your pets with, just keep hoarding your money.  </P>

<P>
Ding!  You've hit level 9.  Now what?
</P>

<P>
It's time for you to help your tailor friend out now.  By now you should
have a full body of silk armor and are good to go!  You can provide you
and your partner with a plethora of jewelry to assist in all different
types of fighting.  The first thing you need to do know is go to
Everlore.com and look up all the formulas for creating various jewelry.
It's time to buy your supplies and it can be tough to find them.  First
you need to buy your kit.  You'll need to go into the third gate in
Neriak.  You'll need to go into a place called The Bauble.  This is
where you can find most of the gems you will be using and your kit.  Go
ahead and get some gems but start out cheap because you are only
beginning.  Start with Cat's Eye Agate and get about double the amount
of stones for the jewelry in case of failures.  These are the cheapest
and work great for getting better prices on other supplies from now on.
These stones will create a +3 CHA necklace.  Also see if they have
bloodstones.  Those are the only earrings you can make with silver and
earrings are in pretty high demand.  Star Rose Quartz are good ones for
Nektulos forest as they make +2 INT rings but those are more expensive
so you may want to build up your skill just a bit before purchasing
them.
</P>

<P>
Don't forget to get the spell!  Believe it or not, you also get your
spell in the third gate.  You'll need to go to the Library and talk to
the guy standing in the center.  He's got all the enchant metal spells.
Go to the Ogre section of Neriak Foreign Quarter to buy your silver.  If
you've never heard of this place before, you can ask someone how to
get there or just make a right at the green skeleton faces as you
first enter Neriak instead of the left to get to the bar to sell.
You'll go up an incline and Viola!  You'll recognize it by the steel
doors and Ogres.  You need to go to a place called Shinie Tings to buy
all your silver bars.  Get as many bars as you got gems.  The way to get
out of this place is tricky at first since you got there probably by
jumping off of roof tops.  Find the inclined area with the two female
ogres standing next to each other.  That's your way out.
</P>

<P>
You've got your supplies so what should you make?
</P>

<P>
By now you should have done your research on Everlore.com and found all
your recipes.  I made a lot of mistakes here and bought all kinds of
gems to make all kinds of jewelry.  I can tell you the first thing you
should make is a +3 CHA necklace for you and your partner and maybe a
few extras to sell.  From then on, you both should be putting on your
necklaces whenever you go into town and sell.  I have found that the
best prices are in the Commons.  Plus your tailor partner will be
grateful to finally get something for him/herself other than favors.
</P>

<P>
Memorize your spell and cast.  It will automatically pull out a bar of
silver.  Put the bar of silver in a box in your jewelry making kit and
select a stone, placing it in another box in the kit.  Hit &quot;combine&quot; 
and hopefully a piece of jewelry will appear.  If not, just keep practicing.
You'll get there.  Remember, you have to enchant the silver bar BEFORE
making the jewelry or it won't be enchanted.
</P>

<P>
Once you've created a few +3 CHA necklaces, you can make some earrings.
If you didn't see any bloodstones at The Bauble, go around to all the
merchants in the Enchanter's guild.  One of them will be carrying some.
Buy a bunch since you can only make one earring at a time.  Make enough
earrings for you, your partner and some to sell.  If you had enough
money to get some rose quartz and have done several practices on
bloodstones and agates, go ahead and make some +2 INT rings for
yourself.  These will be a good boost for you in jewelry making and
getting less fizzles on your spells.
</P>

<P>
Don't even bother making Save vs. Poison or Disease rings except for you
and your partner.  They are great when fighting snakes and spiders in
combating their poison but there's no market for them.  People would
rather have boosts in their main stats.  Also don't bother making any +2
DEX bracelets.  Cutthroat Dervish rings have the same function and people
can barely give those away.  The biggest problem a lot of people have
with the jewelry is they have no armor class.  At least when you're
starting out.  The necklaces should be stored in a separate place and
worn only in town.  The rings don't need to have armor class but the
bracelets can only be worn if they remove their armor.  People LOVE
earrings so make lots.  I've gotten a lot of requests for INT earrings so
I looked it up.  There are only two type of earrings that I found that
contain INT points and they require a Sapphire, which is EXTREMELY
expensive for you at this point.  INT rings will sell great in Nektulos
forest and WIS rings work great too.
</P>

<P>
You can also go to East Commonlands which is straight south past the
bridge and do your auctions.  Just make sure to stay in the entrance if
you are a lower level, in case you need to jump back.  Gate is also
GREAT for this purpose.  If people don't immediately respond to your
auctions, have patience.  It's feast or famine out there.  Just keep a
bag with you with one or two of each and keep doing your auctions.  I
usually do price the +3 CHA necklaces, +2 WIS rings and +2 STA earrings
at 2PP ea.  I price the INT rings at 3PP and STR rings go for 4PP ea.
</P>

<P>
In the meantime, keep fighting wolves and spiders and helping out your
partner.  Remember, the only way you'll gain levels is to fight
monsters!  So take a break from jewelry making once in a while and keep
fighting for 12th level where you can get better spells and &quot;Enchant
Electrum&quot;!
</P>

<P>
This is the stage I am at now.  I haven't been playing EQ for very long
and this is my first character.  I just barely got into the double digits
with my leveling so I'm still pretty new at this.  I have reached a point
where I don't bother much with selling the cheap jewelry except when I
see someone giving an auction that they want to buy some.  You can keep
some extra supplies with you for this purpose.  Now I mostly just fight
and try to find ways to raise extra money for the high priced items.  I
concentrate on getting high quality bear pelts which sell for 5PP a
piece.  You can also enchant silver for a fee for other non-enchanters
that want to make jewelry.  I have found several people that do this. 
It's time consuming but can be worth it.  Skellies also make good money
and Shadow Wolf pelts.  Once you get into 7th level and above, you can
venture into East Commons and fight Dark Weed Snakes.  Their fangs and
venom sacks are worth a lot, but beware of their poison, it's vicious! 
Willowisps give light stones which make good loot and if you dare, the
Orc camps usually give good loot and experience points.  I have just
started going into Lava Storm and found that the Fire Elementals drop
bloodstones.  Yippee!  I don't know as of yet, which creatures, if any,
drop other kinds of stones but I'm anxious to find out.
</P>

<P>
Good luck to you and good hunting.  If you see me and have any questions
or suggestion, please don't hesitate!
