<P>
I was  born in the Maiden's Fancy, a brothel of some reknown in the heart of 
Neriak.  As my life began, my mothers ended.  I later learned that while she was 
carrying she often bragged that she was the beloved of a Cleric who was going to 
provide for her and I after I was born.  Of course, that never came to pass and 
in my time in the 'Fancy I often heard many such stories that women make up to 
comfort themselves while carrying a child.
</P>

<P>
Growing  up was a puzzling experience, as I was property of the 'Fancy - so I 
remember days spent talking to the mercenaries, Lords and anonymous travelers 
upstairs in the bar.  From this early age, I craved information about the world 
and would ask endless questions about adventures that travellers had 
experienced.  The owner thought it would be amusing to train me to entertain at 
an early age, and so very early on I remember doing acrobatics for patrons 
before or after their desires were sated downstairs.  Complaints about me, 
specifically high-bred people complaining about my analyzing stare, shortened my 
career as an entertainer and I was resigned to escaping my room and running 
around Neriak exploring.  My scrutiny was then turned towards our city and the 
people and visitors within.  I became good in those years at hiding and moving 
undetected as I struggled to hear conversations that we not meant to be 
overheard and to follow the secretive.  My favorite places to spend my time were 
reading in the Library about the adventures that others had experienced beyond 
Neriak and lurking in the Arena to watch warriors battle. As a result of my 
early education I had my own ideas about how to excel in fighting.  But, unlike 
other children, I had no parents to provide even a wooden weapon for me to 
practice with, so I watched the other mock-battles simmering with frustration 
and rage at my lack of resources.
</P>

<P>
When  I had barely reached the age of maturity, I was moved downstairs to serve 
with the other women of the Fancy.  Unless I wished to turn myself over the the 
service of the temple the 'Fancy was the best income I was likely to find for 
one my age (as I was not born into a profession).  We were all an odd lot, we 
spanned all races and were closer than sisters and also fiercely competitive.  
Unlike my time upstairs as a child entertaining patrons with my songs, I was 
able to make and keep much of the money I earned.  I was generally treated well 
and found it an easy and enjoyable way to spend my time and earn an income.
</P>

<P>
One  evening after spending some time with a very secretive Teir'dal client, he 
asked me if I'd like to make a little more money than I already was.  He needed 
some ongoing work done, and I wanted the money so we came to an agreeable deal.
</P>

<P>
After  that, every so often someone would wind up missing in Neriak after being 
seen at the Fancy.  Oh, I was most careful not to be caught, sometimes my method 
of choice was poison in their wine, and sometimes it was the old fashioned 
dagger in the back.  Another body in Neriak wasn't anything new and only the 
most cursory of investigations were ever done - perhaps to satisfy the 
persistant whining of a widow or an unfortunate child.  At any rate, I was paid 
well for my services and grew to be passingly well at my newfound position.
</P>

<P>
Time  passed and I met many interesting people at the 'Fancy.  I met a seasoned 
warrior who when not travelling spent much of her off time in my company, a 
baker by trade who was planning to run away from Neriak to find another 
profession and a Shadow Knight who fancied himself quite the romantic bard!  My 
time spent working was enjoyable and I was amassing quite a fortune.
</P>

<P>
One  evening I was approached by a couple in robes, one appeared to be a Cleric 
and the other his Necromancer companion.  I only clearly remember they had 
wanted to hire me for the evening, and I had the time to spare so we worked out 
a mutually acceptable agreement and they retired to my quarters with me.  I 
still have nightmares about that evening - the low laughter of the Cleric and 
the high shrill orders of the Necromancer and the touch of her icy hard hands.  
My memories are hazy, thankfully.  From what little I do recall, I witnessed and 
was forced by strength to be part in some of the most low and vile acts that can 
be imagined even in children's whispered imaginings and adult's nightmares.
</P>

<P>
At  some point in the evening, I must have attempted escape, because the next 
thing I remember I was in a dwelling and being tended to by a young man named 
Sevok.  I was on large bruise from head to toe and suffered from night terrors 
that often left me screaming in an unknown language in the middle of my sleep.  
I thankfully stayed for awhile with him while my physical and emotional scars 
that burned me were being healed by time and sleep.
</P>

<P>
Sevok  demanded the identity of those who had hurt me once I told him what had 
happend, but in my waking moments all the memories are hazy.  Each time Sevok 
would bring a cleric to help me, I fought them and did my best to push them out 
the door, I was so terribly frightened that one of them somehow knew the cleric 
who tried to drive me to death and insanity.  The last cleric that Sevok brought 
to tend me was one of my former companions from the 'Fancy and my memories of 
his friendship relaxed me and his healing spells sped me back to full health.
</P>

<P>
For  the first time in my life, I was frightened about my fate should I either 
be able to identify the cleric and the necromancer (I had but scant clues to go 
on) and it was with reluctance that Sevok escorted me to the 'Fancy so that I 
could gather my possessions and bid my co-workers farewell.  Two of my former 
associates gifted me with a set of armor and a good weapon so that I could make 
my way the only way that I knew how and felt safe - as an assassin.
