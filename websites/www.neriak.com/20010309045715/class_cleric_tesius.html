Guide to playing a Dark Elf Cleric
</P>

<P>
By Tesius Lux of Solusek Ro, cleric of the 42nd circle
</P>

<P>
Introduction:
</P>

<P>
So you want to be a cleric, huh? And a dark elf cleric to boot. Well, you must like a life of hardship and pain, cause it ain’t easy being either. Not only will you be hated just about everywhere you go, but you will also have to almost completely depend on the skills of others, just to survive. But hey, you don’t mind, right? After all, why would you be reading this if you didn’t like to suffer? Besides, there are unique benefits to being a cleric. We as a class come into our own at the higher levels, and you’ll be loved by just about every PC wherever you go, provided you keep them alive long enough for them to thank you.
</P>

<P>
Character Creation:
</P>

<P>
So let’s get right down to it. Creating a new character, especially a cleric, is one of the most difficult decisions to make in this game. The big question on everyone’s mind is &quot;Where do I wanna put my bonus points?&quot;. This depends on how you want to play your cleric. Any cleric guide out there can help you with this, so I won’t spend too much time on it. An extremely good source of information for this is (get ready for the plug!) AllaKhazam's Magical Realm. His address is: everquest.allakhazam.com. My personal opinion is put the points anywhere you want to. You can purchase and quest for items that will increase just about every statistic for your character, so don’t worry if you didn’t put your all bonus points into your primary statistics (the highlighted green numbers for all you new players out there). This is your character, remember that!
</P>

<P>
Newbie Life:
</P>

<P>
Let’s face it. Nektulos Forest as a newbie zone really blows. I mean, it’s really, really dark, and there are only a few good hunting spots where you can get a steady flow of mobs to whack. That being said, you can do one of two things. Either get someone to help you get to the Freeport newbie zone (which also bites, but at least it’s easier to see) and bind you there, or stay in our newbie zone & likely die a few times before you reach level 2. I, being a glutton for punishment, chose the latter. If you do go down this road, let me make a suggestion: GROUP! Most people will tell you that it’s pointless to group until at least level 5 or higher, but I say this isn’t true, especially for our class. Find some poor dark elf and see if he or she will group with you. Not only will you get used to grouping, but you’ve also just made a friend (especially if you save their butts repeatedly).
</P>

<P>
Here’s where you begin to learn how to use your cleric to his/her full potential. I seriously recommend grouping, but if you do choose to solo, go right ahead. Keep in mind, this is a guide, not a bible. At level 1, you and your group should start out with moss snakes and black wolves. They should give you experience until about level 3. At this early point in your life, you don’t possess enough mana to sit back and blast or heal constantly. So whip out your trusty club and start whacking! Until about level 5, your role should be about 70% tank, and 30% healer/nuker.
</P>

<P>
So now you & your new buddy have just killed your first mob. Congratulations! Make sure you loot that sucker. Initially, only take the stackable items, such as snake scales. This will eliminate your need to go back into Neriak to sell. Once you can’t loot anymore (or you’re too heavy to fight), head back into town and get rid of that stuff to the closest merchant. Now go buy yourself a backpack! Yes, you will want to buy this before you buy a weapon, because buying a weapon from a NPC merchant is too costly. You’re better off buying a decent weapon from another player a bit later on. Don’t even worry about armor at this point. The only armor you can afford won’t offer too much protection at this point. Next, go purchase any food or water you may need and dump the rest of your hard-earned cash into the bank.
</P>

<P>
As a cleric, you will want to watch your money wisely. Just be a scrooge, no buts about it. Not only will you have to purchase all of your spells, but that fancy magical plate armor & mace you’ve been eyeing will cost you a pretty penny. So loot when you can, and accept any donations offered to you for services rendered (really). And whatever you do, do not take up Jewelcraft….EVER! (Please refer to any Jeweler’s guide out there to find out why.)
</P>

<P>
Ok, now after killing snakes & wolves until they don’t give you exp anymore, it’s time to move onto bigger and better things! Namely, the undead! It’s here that you will demonstrate your true power as a cleric. Once you hit level 5, head back into town and buy your new spells! You get a new set of spells every 4 levels. So new spells at 5, 9, 14, 19, etc… Make sure you purchase just about every spell for this level, as you will need them all. If you have enough money left over, buy some level 1 spells (namely Divine Aura, Spook the Dead, and Cure Poison).
If you don’t know what each of our spells does, I would suggest printing a spell list from EQ Everquest Caster’s Realm. Their address is: eq.castersrealm.com. Of course, if you want to be safe, buy all of them (just be prepared to run out of money quickly).
</P>

<P>
Next, you and your group should head to either the wizard pyramid or the undead ruins on the other side of the bridge. Use your undead-line of spells to bring the pathetic skeletons and zombies to their knees! Just watch out for the occasional lesser mummy. You will be able to continue hunting these skeletons and zombies until about level 8. They frequently drop rusty weapons, so make sure you loot the first rusty mace or staff that you can, and get rid of that newbie club you’ve been sporting around!
</P>

<P>
Once you begin to hunt the undead, your strategy should change a bit. Now you should be about 50% tank and 50% healer/nuker. You will need to begin to keep a watchful eye over your party members’ health, as the skeletons hit hard and fast for their level.
</P>

<P>
If for some odd reason, you can’t find a group to hunt with, (AND you don’t feel like going out and soloing), FEAR NOT! There is something you can do to better your character. Practice your casting skills! Believe me, you’ll need it! There’s no worse feeling in the world for a cleric than when you try to heal an ailing comrade and your spell fizzles and he/she ends up dying. And get in the practice now, because at higher levels, it will get more & more difficult to gain skill points. For any evocation/alteration/abjuration, you can target yourself and cast the spell. Just make sure you heal yourself afterwards. And you can continue to do this time and time again until you reach your level cap (which is 5 skill points per level, 10 for level 1). Use the spell &quot;Sense the Dead&quot; to bring up your divination skill. HINT: Use this spell to hunt decaying skels, loot the bone chips, and sell them to high level necromancers who don’t have time to hunt for bones. You can make a lot of money this way and you get your practice in!
</P>

<P>
Now the next part is very important. At level 8, head back to the cleric guild and train one point into MEDITATE. This is one of the most important skills you can possibly learn in your Norrathian lifetime. Go ahead and purchase some leather armor for yourself, or have a tailor make some for you. Now it’s time to leave this surrogate home and move into the world of light, The Commonlands!
</P>

<P>
Leaving your Native Land:
</P>

<P>
In East Commons, your ability to find a group should be unparalleled. Just shout to the zone &quot;level X cleric looking for a group!&quot;. You should receive a number of tells saying &quot;Come to XXXX and join us&quot;. If you don’t, go back into Nektulos Forest and get a group together to go hunt in the commons. At this point in your young life, you should be hunting giant scarabs, shadow wolves, and lionesses. You won’t get great loot, but your main concern should be to get to your next circle of spells at level 9.
</P>

<P>
At level 9, you are now a potent healing and buffing machine. Make sure you always cast those buffs, on yourself and your party members. They can mean the difference between experience gain and corpse retrieval. Now it’s time to play a little bit smarter. Because casting your healing spells will work similar to a warrior’s taunt, which will focus the mob’s attention onto you! So make sure your party understands that, or else you’re gonna be one dead cleric.
</P>

<P>
Speaking of which, time to change strategy modes again! As you are likely grouping with more melee classes, you should reduce your role as a &quot;tank&quot;, and go more into the healer role. Don’t worry too much about the nuking part, as the pure casters will take care of that. Begin to utilize your utility spells, such as stun and root. Start carving out your little niche in the magic support category.
</P>

<P>
After level 10, you and your party should be focusing on killing those beloved creatures of Norrath…..ORCS! These lovable creatures will be the main source of your experience gain and income for the next few levels. Killing them can only benefit you, as the faction hits you will take will make the residents of the commons friendlier towards you.
</P>

<P>
Once you reach level 14, head back to the guild and purchase your next round of spells. Make sure you buy Bind Affinity and Smite. Smite will be your only DD spell until level 29. Continue with orcs until you get sick of them, as they should give you exp past level 15. Now your choices to hunt get broader and broader. You can either head to the Oasis or Marr, to the Plains of Karana, or right next door to West Commons. I chose the commons as it is closer and there are fewer people hunting in the zone.
</P>

<P>
In West Commons, your choices of prey become more diverse. In this zone are Dervish Cutthroats, young and mature kodiaks, giant spiders, willowisps (EXCELLENT source of income), the entrance to Befallen (a dungeon filled with undead! Yummy!), and of course the beloved orcs. Just watch out for the occasional hill giant and griffin. These two hit for 80+ damage per hit and are the bane of every low-mid level player.
</P>

<P>
By now, you should have enough cash to upgrade your armor and weapons. You should consider getting either banded or bronze armor, and some stat (WISDOM) enhancing jewelry. As you will still be meleeing occasionally, a good suggestion for a weapon is a bloodforge hammer or a runed totem staff.
</P>

<P>
Exploration!:
</P>

<P>
Now it’s time to decide where you wanna go from here. You have many exciting and wonderous places to visit. The best way to decide though is to ask your friends! Go where they go! You will always be welcome, and you will have no problems finding a group! If your friends are creatures of the light, be careful. You will not be able to go everywhere they do. If your friend consist mainly of dark elves, then your choices of prey are almost endless. Remember, YOU ARE EVIL! This allows you to kill just about anything (as long as it makes sense when role-playing your character)!
</P>

<P>
One suggestion I will make here is whenever you go into a new zone, try to kill whatever gives positive faction hits with the local residents. Not having to go all the way back to Neriak to sell and deposit money in the bank is a necessity. If there are quests that will raise your faction with the locals, DO IT! (especially if it’s an easy one) For example, my cleric can now buy/sell/deposit in many of the major areas where dark elves are normally killed on sight. And I am welcomed in 6 of the 8 main cities on Antonica (those darn barbarians and halflings still don’t like me, hehe).
</P>

<P>
For quest and faction information, my personal favorite site is (again with the plug!) Allakhazam’s Magical Realm. If you didn’t get the address before, here it is again:
everquest.allakhazam.com. This site is a great all-purpose site, and you should be able to find anything that you are looking for here.
</P>

<P>
Life after the mid-teen levels:
</P>

<P>
Ok, you’ve made it to level 16. Congratulations! It’s probably time for you to move onto bigger prey. I found that the orcs (yes, again with the orcs) in HighPass Hold were very good experience at this stage. Although, during the busy hours, it’s next to impossible to get into a group, but once you are in one, it’s one hell of a ride! The orcs spawn in a small area, there are usually at least 3 spawns to contend with, and the spawn rates are small. Meaning you will have very little downtime. For those of us with limited attention spans, this group of mobs is our Eden! I used this place to go from level 16 to level 19.
</P>

<P>
YES, I almost have a surname!:
</P>

<P>
Ok, you are now level 19. GO BUY SPELLS! You will now be able to buff and heal for more HP’s than ever before! Relish your newly gained power! Ok, enough ranting. Realize that you are now one level away from getting a last name. For many, especially myself, this is an accomplishment. In my old guild (which has disbanded recently) I was the first non-founding member to attain a surname. Immediately, other members thought of me as wiser and as a source of information. Totally untrue, but it felt good.
</P>

<P>
Anyway, you will need to refine your grouping tactics from now until level 29. If you do choose to solo, you will only be able to do it effectively until about level 25. After 25, you MUST depend on others for assistance, either via grouping or having buffs cast on you (i.e. SoW). Your burn spell is sorely lacking and you will find that it just doesn’t do enough damage to get rid of the bigger nasties. And when you are grouped, be aware that you will never again be the hero that vanquished the monster. Instead, you will be the one who made it possible for the hero to vanquish the monster with your buffs and heals.
</P>

<P>
Mid-level life:
</P>

<P>
Once I hit level 20, I headed to Lake Rathe. Another great area with a good range of mobs for levels 20-30. At the lower 20’s, aviak guards are a good source of exp. They spawn in small clusters and are spread out in the zone. They also spawn fairly quickly, so there is actually not too much competition for them (except on busy nights). They also drop decent loot. Hunt these long enough and you can ALMOST purchase that magical plate mail you’ve always wanted.
</P>

<P>
Once you get to about level 22-23, you will want to move onto the small gnoll/undead camp near the South Karana zone. The gnolls spawn during the EverQuest day, and the undead take their place at night. The undead are especially tough, but luckily there is the zone nearby in case you have to run. This place is good hunting all the way up to level 30, but having to wait for night to roll around can be a pain. If the wait doesn’t sound appealing to you, then you can either try your luck in South Karana at the aviak city, or stay in Lake Rathe and select stone skeletons as your prey. In my personal opinion, the aviak city stinks. Not only is it camped 24/7, but also the mobs don’t spawn quickly enough. So I elected to hunt stone skeletons.
</P>

<P>
The stone skeleton camp in Lake Rathe is to the left as you come out of the Ferrott zone. It is the tower behind the single aviak spawn on the &quot;diving board&quot;. The mob consists of 2 stone skeletons and their pets. Both the skeletons are casters with nasty AE spells and damage shields. These mobs are not easy, and I would only suggest tackling them with a good druid and tank in the group. Don’t even try these mobs without a balanced group. My personal choice would be one cleric, two tanks (one with a bow), an enchanter, a druid, and a necromancer. Basic strategy: The cleric begins by casting any HP, AC, fire and magic resistance buffs he/she can. The druid begins by casting harmony on all the mobs. Then the tank pulls one skeleton from a safe distance and brings it to the group. This normally brings one skel and both pets. Next, the enchanter mesmerizes one pet and then he/she and the necromancer sic their pets onto the other skel pet. Meanwhile, everyone else focuses on the skeleton. The enchanter can either debuff the mobs or start blasting away. The necro casts whatever DOT’s he/she can to the pet(s). Your job as a cleric is not to participate until someone gets low on health (which will happen very quickly). So the cleric must be on alert at all times, or someone will die. It’s also the party’s responsibility to get the mobs off the cleric. Dead cleric = dead party, no joke. Once the skeleton is gone, kill off the pets, rest, then tackle the other skeleton. Try to stagger the spawns so that you are only dealing with one skel at a time. If both spawn, have the druid cast harmony again. Do this spot correctly, and you will wonder what happened to the past 6 hours and how your experience bar filled up so quickly!
</P>

<P>
Time to get an unlisted phone number (or at least go anon…):
</P>

<P>
Ok, so now you are level 29. This is the level where we start to really define ourselves as a class. You get an upgrade to your DD spell (YAY!). AND, you get REVIVE! This is the first spell in this line of spells. Basically, you can resurrect another PC just by targeting a corpse and casting the spell. Handy when your buddy’s corpse is near you and he’s bound on another continent. You will get two more of these spells, and those will also give back some experience lost. See why clerics are so sought-after?
</P>

<P>
So now is where you must decide. Do I want to go hunt giants and griffins and Cyclopes….or do I want to kill wood elves? Hehe, being a dark elf, the choice should be obvious! So head to Freeport and hop on the boat to the Ocean of Tears! Make sure you bind in Freeport first. The very first stop is the Island of the Sisters of Erolissi. Be warned, there is one sister at the end of the dock, and no one on this island particularly likes dark elves (then again, who does?). So as a precaution, jump off the boat when it comes close to the island, and swim to shore. There are five sisters you can hunt here, three of them being solo spawns. Simple, right? Wrong! These sisters, although they don’t cast, hit for 60+ damage and have bash. And you will take serious faction hits with just about everything on Faydwer, so know what you are getting into. But, if you don’t care, you can hunt these sisters until level 35! Sweet, huh? Plus they give excellent loot in the form of words, gems, and purity belts! Just watch out for the occasional seafury cyclops (approx level 40) and you should be able to breeze to level 35. Don’t forget to head back to Neriak and buy your level 34 spells!
</P>

<P>
At this point in your life, you can almost completely forget about tanking. The melee classes will do it 10 times better than you. Even the necromancer and magician pets are better than you are at this! And the casters will embarrass you with the amount of spell damage they can do, so don’t bother nuking. You can still pop in every once in a while with your trusty weapon or a burn spell, but your role should now be delegated to Healer #1. So sit back, meditate, and watch your group’s health like a hawk. HINT: Since you won’t be meleeing or nuking, after a heal or 2, sit back down and meditate! You can never have enough mana.
</P>

<P>
Life in the mid-30’s:
</P>

<P>
When you get to level 35, you will experience your first real &quot;hell level&quot;. For those of you who do not know, it is a level that takes more experience to complete than any level near it. So it takes more experience to complete level 30 than it will for level 32 or 28.
</P>

<P>
Ok, so the sisters don’t give you experience anymore. Where to go? Well, most people go to Cazic-Thule, or go to Rathe Mountains to kill hill giants. Where should a dark elf cleric go? Back to the Commonlands! Now I know you’re saying &quot;the commons? What’s to hunt there?&quot;. I’ll tell you: DRUIDS! Yes, druids. Remember, you’re evil. And druids are &quot;good&quot;. Hence good vs. evil. Get it?
</P>

<P>
There are two sets of druids in the commons. One pair on a hill in East Commons, and a pair at the druid circle in West Commons. My personal favorite is the pair in West Commons. Both sets are casters, approximately level 30, and cast the appropriate spells for that level. They drop excellent loot (fine steel weapons mostly) and have a relatively short respawn time (about 7 minutes). And you can hunt them till level 42! For these mobs, I would recommend having a necro in your party. Their DOT’s and fear spells make them potent allies. You almost have to fear them, or else they will heal themselves and each other, which makes for a rather unpleasant trip to the zone…
</P>

<P>
As for selling, anyone can sell their loot to the merchant inside the druid ring (in West Commons). You will never lose faction with her, no matter how many druids you kill. As for East Commons, your choices are more limited. If you’ve killed enough orcs, you can sell to the merchants in the inns nearby the hill. Otherwise, go to the Shady Swashbuckler inside the tunnel to North Ro.
</P>

<P>
Be warned however, that once you begin killing druids, it’s very difficult to go back (due to bad faction hits with anything remotely related to the tree-huggers). Also you can forget about any druid group teleports to areas with druid npc’s surrounding the ring (unless you go invisible first).
</P>

<P>
Ok, so now you’ve reached level 39. GO BUY SPELLS, especially your next &quot;rez&quot; spell. This is the first one that gives you back experience. You can also upgrade your armor and weapons.
</P>

<P>
Life at level 40 and above:
</P>

<P>
Ok, level 40 officially blows. It’s a hell level, and a doozy of one at that. But be persistent and you will eventually complete it and move further. Unfortunately, I hear that level 45 is much worse. =P
</P>

<P>
After level 42, friends of mine have suggested different places to hunt. One option: you can go to Steamfont mountains and kill gnome guards <EM>(Editor's note: this may have changed since they buffed the newbie guards)</EM>. They will give you experience up till level 48. Another option is specters in Ferrott forest. They’re always fun, especially when the hack away with those scythes. Pair up with another cleric, and the two of you can ping-pong specs till the cows come home.
</P>

<P>
You could stick with the guard motif and go kill Freeport or Qeynos guards (just not the ones guarding the gate). Or you can go to Lower Guk. Or Sol A or B. Seafury Cyclopes in the Ocean of Tears is great experience. Or you could be creative, and try killing certain NPC’s within cities, such as the Steel Warriors in Qeynos and Freeport. Or the ogre paladin at the Seafarer’s Roost in East Freeport. I would suggest that you visit (yes, yet another plug ) Illia’s Beastiary. It’s very informative in terms of monster levels, faction, and locations. The site address is: eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com. Do some research into mobs, and find the best monster for you and your friends to hunt. The choice is yours to make.
</P>

<P>
One last suggestion. Try to equip yourself with the best possible armor and weapons you can buy or loot. By this point, you should have a minimum of 150 wisdom points, and the rest of your stats should be pretty well rounded.
Well, that’s all for now. Have fun with your dark elf cleric and make an impression in Norrath!
