This is the tale of Siliddar T'vil. The reborn Necromancer of Innoruuk.
</P>

<P>
Long, Long, Long ago in the begining of the Age of Blood. The city of 
Neriak was struggling to survive from the relentless attacks by Humans from 
the nearby Settlement of Freeport.  Innoruuk knew his twisted creations were 
not yet able to defend themselves, and without his intervention, would soon 
be destroyed. So he took it upon himself to create a guardian of the region 
now called Nektulos.
</P>

<P>
He began the creation by cutting himself and bleeding into a tiny 
Jade-inlaid coffin. He laid this coffin on his sacred altar deep in the 
Plane which he calls home, and began to chant.  Magical energies swirled 
around him as he casted. The blood quickly came to a boil and spilled over 
onto the altar. The blood increased in size and took the shape of a Dark 
Elven male. When the man awoke Innoruuk named him Siliddar, and sent him 
down to the edge of Nektulos to guard the Dark Elven realm. Siliddar quickly 
took back Nektulos Forrest and slew any enemy that entered his forest.  
Being created by the blood of Innoruuk he did not grow old and thus 
continued to guard the city of Neriak until the end of the Age of Blood when 
Sir Luclin of Freeport came with his strongest warriors and finally laid 
rest to Siliddar. Fortunatetly by that time Neriak had grown strong enough 
to hold its own against Luclin and what remained of his forces...
</P>

<P>
Knowing that the loss of such a formidable opponent to all of Neriaks 
enemies was a disaster, Innoruuk gathered his power for several ages until 
now.
</P>

<P>
Reborn in a new age Siliddar has quickly regained his seat in power, 
and is ready to destroy all those who stand in his way.
