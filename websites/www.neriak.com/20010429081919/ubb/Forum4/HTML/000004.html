</FONT><HR>We got a little off track from his original question - which is how to attract 'good raced' roleplayers to events, or just generally to roleplaying.<P>I think, and I think this is probably done a lot, one of the most effective ways is to make a character of the race you're interested in attracting people from and just fight, hunt, roleplay with that race and generally 'up' the roleplaying in that area.<P>The down point of this is that it takes time away from what may be your primary character.  But, the returns on this are manyfold!<P>First, you may learn to play a class you've never directly played before.  This is extremely valuable knowledge, because the best group member is one that knows each classes strengths and weaknesses and can work with them.<P>It also introduces you to people you've probably never met before.  You'll probably find roleplayers in places you never expected.  Lots of roleplayers have more than one character, so if you meet someone and express an interested in their other characters - you may find that many of their character slots are filled. =)<P>You'll find the 'voice' of another race, and if you really submerge yourself into their culture, politics, etc you can easily find ways to poke at them when verbally sparring with them.  <IMG SRC="http://www.neriak.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P><BR>What I do wish is that there was a database somewhere where roleplaying guilds from both sides could submit a bit about themselves and a contact point between guild leaders. Not for guild wars necessarily (Because, speaking now as one who plays a rogue, I have *no talent* for PVP since the poison delays went in) -- but for arranging just attendance at an event.  <P><BR>Events -- a few months ago Sevok and I participated in an event at the Chessboard in ButcherBlock.  Many many darkrace people showed up due to lots of rallying, but not as many light raced people (my rallying was limited as I was stuck in one particular zone/spot due to the role I was playing).  Everyone involved got /tells asking if this was a GM event, and I even personally got some wanting to know if any kewl loot was involved (meaning that if so, they'd pretend they were roleplayers to get something)<P>This frustrated me to no end, and while I did have a *complete blast* at the event, this attitude of 'I'll only roleplay if loot is involved' has always bothered me!<P><BR>The question still remains, these are only things that I've seen and that I've heard of guilds and roleplayers doing to try to stir up interest.  I had wanted to bring this point up again and add some thoughts in the hopes that we can get some discussion on this.  <IMG SRC="http://www.neriak.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Zariu Qu`el`velguk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.78.66.223</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR><BR>  There are certainly roleplayers amongst the good races, but I'll agree that they are hard to find. It's a pity there's no way to label yourself in the game as one.<P>  The best way to attract them, I suppose, is to hold events that appeal to socializing and roleplaying rather than combat or skill with hotkeys. Ogre and troll guilds should hold drinking contests practically every week, for example.<P>  Dark elves, being a more civilized lot, would probably opt for more refined contests. Online debates would be fun if moderated properly, and history trivia contests would be a good test of the game background.<P>  One event I would like to see is a debate between dark and high elves. According to legend, all dark elves are descended from the first elf king and queen. That means that by right of blood we are their rulers. A group of dark elves could travel to Greater Faydark and insist that they surrender Felwithe to us.<P>  I like your comment about a detailed list of guilds and their philosophies. Finding opposite-minded guilds to compete against (not warring) would help to bring out the roleplayers.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 209.220.27.250</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

</FONT><HR>Hail All,<P>I have noticed this lack of roleplaying myself and it is disturbing. I guess the KOS situation tends to discourage the average powergamer from playing a "dark" race; this could be a reason there are so few RPing "light" race characters. However, they are out there.<P>I know, for I am one of them. Just the other day, I was questing within Nek forest when a heated argument erupted between myself and some of your brethren.<P>It seemed a few Tier'dal thought it unseemly that I (a human Shadow Knight) was sullying your land with my presence. Well, needless to say, I was eventually challenged by a Necromancer a few seasons older than myself and had to do some quick thinking. I think I got him to see reason on the aspect of Innoruuk's plans for the Dismal Rage and how we do nothing but benefit the nation of the Tier'dal. The discussion ended graciously if not freindly and blood was not spilled (luckily for me).<P>Anyways, a few minutes later, I get a /tell from one of the Tier'dal complementing me how I handled the situation and congratulating my on my RP skills.... no one has ever done that before. I was very surprised and it left me with a warm glow in my otherwise cold heart  <IMG SRC="http://www.neriak.com/ubb/smile.gif">.<P>It is strange that most (virtually all that I meet) dark races RP as much as they do. I also find it strange that I (a light race playing evil) am one of the few "light" raced individuals I know that RP...hmmm.<P>I find, for RPing reasons, I much prefer to hunt within the lands of the Tier'dal. Hopefully, through the  spreading of Innoruuks will, we can change this static RP problem and bring RP to the light races.<P>Anvill<BR>5th season Knight of the Dismal Rage<BR>Servent of Innoruuk<BR>Luclin Server<P>"Conan, what is good in life?"...."To crush your enemies before you and hear the lamenting of their women"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 142.39.200.51</font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000004&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000004&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
