[B]I'd say it took me all total around 8-12 hours of solid fighting at the Orc and Gnoll spawns before the guards regarded me "dubiously".

I've killed so many Orcs now that they no longer give me positive faction with the NPCs in Highpass.  My faction with ShralokOrcs keeps getting worse though.  =)

The gnolls still give me positive faction, however.

There are ways to avoid Highpass (by going through Runnyeye) but it doesn't really solve anything since you now have to travel through (ACK!) Rivervale, home of the Knee Biters.  Some people might be content with spending their entire EverQuest life in only a few zones, but I love traveling and seeing new places.  Having to sneak through Highpass with invisibility is a major pain in the neck, especially if you have to rely on others for the invis.<P>The next benefit to hunting in Highpass is the experience.  WOW!  I went up three levels (from 17 to 20) in a very short period of time hunting mostly at the Orc spawn.  It's a free-for-all zone, which means you should try to get into a STRONG group in order to get the kills.<P>The final benefit applies mainly to you skilled craftspeople out there.  Highpass has almost EVERYTHING it seems when it comes to trade skills!  Whether you want to work on smithing, tailoring, pottery, or whatever...it seems like you can buy ALL the rare and difficult-to-find materials here.<P>So there you have it.  Three reasons why I highly recommend hunting in Highpass in your high teens and low twenties.  If you stay by the Orc spawn while you're still KOS, you can fight with a relative degree of safety since the nearest NPC is a "Volunteer" that conned VERY green to me at level 17.  He stays put unless someone trains him to the zone, and even then he cannot really hurt you much.  He's also handy for quick "faction checks".  Ease around the corner, target him from a distance, and con him to see if you've gone from "glaring threateningly" to "glares at you dubiously".<P>Good hunting, and may your Hate keep you strong.<P><P>------------------<BR><B>Zolor DarkFury &lt;Avengers Federation&gt;</B><BR><I>Teir'Dal Shadowknight of Innoruuk</I><BR><I>(The Nameless)</I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#303070"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Sevok Celith'ar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Zolor:<BR><B>Wow...it takes FOREVER to not be KOS in Highpass</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>How long did it take before you were dubious/apprehensively/non-KOS?

I did this in blackburrow for Qeynos faction, just go around and cast siphon strength (or maybe lifetap) on everything that anybody is fighting, and you'll get faction much, much quicker.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#202050"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Rols</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Since HHP is such a free for all area. Let the people know you are just getting faction then tag each spawn once and backoff or hide.  If you are able to get into a group and are no longer KOS, ask them to let you turn in the pelts for the group experience so that you get the faction.  Once you no longer get faction from the Orcs, move over to the Gnolls.  If you are above lv 20 then go to the basement and do Goblins until you can bank and shop safely. <P>------------------<BR>War determines who is right by who is left.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
