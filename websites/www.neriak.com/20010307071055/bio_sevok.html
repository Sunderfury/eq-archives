<P>
The history of the Necromancer Sevok is one, like that of most Teir'dal, 
fraught with pain and violence.  The tendency of the Children of Innoruuk to 
violently rebel against their parents was not escaped by Sevok.
</P>

<P>
His parents were fairly well-respected members of Neriak society -- his 
father a Dragoon in service of the City, and his mother the former owner of 
The Bauble in the Third Gate.  His only sibling, his brother Sylad, had run 
away at an early age to seek fame and fortune, and had not been heard from 
since.  
</P>

<P>
Given  his father was a Dragoon, Sevok's acceptance into the ranks of the 
Shadow Knights was a given.  Sevok, however, did not share his father's wish 
that he become a Knight of Innoruuk.
</P>

<P>
His plan was to simply muddle through until his ninth season, when he would 
finally learn the secrets of magic, and then behave as a spellcaster, 
forsaking his physical training.  This plan of course did not work out well, 
as his Masters at the school of Knights required harsh physical combat of him 
in order to progress in Rank.
</P>

<P>
During his fifth season as a Knight, Sevok began speaking with the Master of 
the Necromancer's guild, who was very impressed with his natural intellect 
and strong grasp of magical theory.  The Master saw in Sevok the capacity to 
become a truly terrifying Necromancer, and told Sevok that he should 
immediately leave the School of Knights and begin study of Necromancy.
</P>

<P>
Sevok's father, of course, did not abide this.  His son would be a Shadow 
Knight like himself, and he would hear nothing to dissuade him.  Little did 
he know that Sevok had already learned some of the spells of Necromancy and 
before he knew it, Sevok had summoned a skeletal Servitor, given it a rusty 
scimitar, and commanded it to attack his father!  He followed this with a 
powerful spell of poisoning, as well as several life-stealing spells, and 
soon Sevok had committed patricide, something not considered a crime in 
Neriak.
</P>

<P>
Upon hearing the news of Sevok's disgracing the family and murdering his 
father, Sevok's mother hung herself in the back room of The Bauble, leaving 
Sevok an orphan, a status he had no problem with.  Given that what he had 
done was not considered overly wrong in Teir'dal society, the possessions of 
his parents became his, leaving him a very well-off young Necromancer.  
Wanting nothing to do with the demeaning title of shopkeeper, he simply 
auctioned The Bauble off to the highest bidder.
</P>

<P>
Now free to practice Necromancy with the total acceptance of everyone in his 
life (meaning himself and his Guildmaster), Sevok headed out into Nektulos 
forest to practice his spells on the local creatures.
</P>

<P>
Whilst in Neriak selling the spoils of his latest hunting trip, Sevok 
witnessed a very strange event.  He was in the Third Gate area, near The 
Maiden's Fancy, an establishment he knew all too well.  He heard the sound of 
a young woman, yelling, screaming, at the top of her lungs in a language he 
had not heard before.  He turned to look at the Fancy, to see who was making 
this racket, and he saw running from the brothel a beautiful young Teir'dal 
woman, completely naked, running about the square, yelling and screaming in 
a language completely foreign to all who heard it.  
</P>

<P>
Young women running from the Fancy was not an uncommon sight really, as the 
tastes of travellers to Neriak run a bit strange as one would expect, but 
this young one was in serious trouble.  Running after her were two strangely 
dressed older Teir'dal, one a man the other a woman.  They were yelling 
commands at her in Elder Teir'dal, a language Sevok had learned well ahead of 
when he should.  Their commands for her to shut up and come back inside were 
completely ignored, as she had apparently been driven quite mad.  This young 
woman was quite beautiful, and Sevok thought it would be a shame to for her 
to die, so he placed himself between her and her attackers, and shouted at 
them, in Elder Teir'dal: &quot;Leave this one alone you fools!  I am a 
Necromancer of the fiftieth rank, and if you do not leave her to me, I shall 
visit upon you the destruction of Vampiric Curse and Venom of the Snake!&quot;  
</P>

<P>
Sevok's knowledge of the Elder Tongue and the powerful spells of 
Arch-Necromancers had the assailants fooled, they believed he was indeed a 
Necromancer of the fiftieth rank and they simply bowed to him and went on 
their way.
</P>

<P>
Relieved that his ruse worked, Sevok dragged the poor young woman, who was 
now collapsed on the ground convulsing and sobbing uncontrollably, to his 
home, not far from the square.  He cursed himself for not getting a better 
look at the assailants, for he wished to seek revenge at a later time, but he 
was glad to be alive and have this beautiful young woman in his home.
</P>

<P>
Over the days and weeks to follow, Sevok saw to it that this woman, Zariu he 
finally learned from her, was well taken care of.  His parent's money went a 
long way to getting her the best care that Neriak's Clerics had to offer, 
though she refused the service of most of them.  He was left with 
considerably less money, but with, in the end, a companion, friend, and 
lover.
