[Creating a wizard]<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
</H4>

<H4>INTRODUCTION</H4>

<P>
Wizards are basically the warriors of the pure casters. We do one thing 
well, and that is nuking. Being the masters of direct damage has its 
advantages and disadvantages. Which i'll discuss later on in the guide.
</P>

<P>
Therefore creating a Wizard doesn't really a complex issue. As long as you 
make a fairly balanced character, you'll not have trouble getting a very 
playable wizard at level 50. (Or 60 after the expansion for that matter)
</P>

<H4>STATS</H4>

<P>
Basically, Int is the most important stat for wizards. More INT = More mana. 
And although max INT seems to be 255, there is a soft cap of 200, which 
means any points after that won't affect anything.
</P>

<P>
AGI seems to be the next thing most wizards work on, this stat determines 
how much you get hit during a battle and affects AC a little.
</P>

<P>
STR isn't as important as INT or AGI, buts its a stat you won't want to 
neglect, as it helps you carry a little more loot before you are encumbered.
</P>

<P>
Other then the above 3 stats, the rest of the starting stats can be left as 
they are, they won't affect you much.
</P>

<H4>RACE</H4>

<P>
Basically 5 races can be chosen from when creating your wizard. Them being, 
Dark Elf, Erudite, Gnome, High Elf, Human. Basically, as long as you put in 
enough points to get your starting Intelligence stat to 130+. It shouldn't 
be a problem to get your character to hit the 200 int soft cap at the higher 
levels.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>DARK ELF</STRONG> - A very good choice for a wizard, high AGI to start with and INT 
only second to an Erudite. They also have ultravision, unlike their 
practically blind in the dark counterparts Erudites and Humans.
Getting their STR to 65 and putting the remaining points in INT seems to 
work good for a Dark Elf. (Mainly KOS in the good cities)
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>ERUDITE</STRONG> - They start with the most base INT, but that doesn't automatically 
make them the best choice. They start with low AGI, are literally blind in 
the dark, and although not KOS in most cities, aren't very well liked 
either. (This can easily be fixed though). One good thing about this is the 
cheap spells they can get in Erudin, where every non-research only spell can 
be bought. They have what people call the worst newbie zone in Norrath too, 
Toxx forest. (Personal Opinion here ;)
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>GNOME</STRONG> - You have to admit, they look cute =) They also start with 
ultravision. 65 STR and the rest into INT works good for Gnomes too. They 
are also the only class who can can get the Tinkering skill up. And can make 
some pretty cool items.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>HIGH ELF</STRONG> - Low STR and INT make this class a little weaker then the others. 
But if you don't mind being able to carry a little less, getting STR to 60 
and putting the rest into INT will make you a pretty decent starting wizard. 
They get infravision and high starting wisdom. If you want to be successful 
in your trade skills, you might want to choose a High Elf for a slight 
advantage over the others.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>HUMAN</STRONG> - Well, basically a human for any class other then monks aren't worth 
the time. (Some may disagree with me) But although they have very balanced 
stats, their low INT won't do you much good. Unless you blow all your 
starting points on INT, which isn't a good idea. You'll end up needing alot 
of high end equipment just to hit the 200 int soft cap.
</P>

[Basic wizard information] Levels 1-12<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
</H4>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>Always keep your shielding spell up. It helps you alot. Easy enough =)

<LI>Once you get your root spell, use it. You aren't a melee class,   getting 
more nukes before you have to start meleeing a mob is to your advantage.

<LI>For lower levels, once you get shadowstep is a great spell when you fight 
in flat zones (Karanas). The shadowstep-gate combo is priceless at lower 
levels and can save you from certain death. [A little less known secret is 
that if you shadowstep into water, stay still and cast your gate spell. Most 
of the time, the mob won't even find you and you'll be safe to gate away, 
just hope you aren't in shark/pirahna infested waters ;)]

<LI>Do not forget how useful your bind spell is, binding outside the zone you 
are fighting is normally the best although there are other options open, 
experimentation is the key here.
</OL>
</P>

<H4>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
[Intermediate wizard information] Level 12-29<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
</H4>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>Most important now, as you start to group more often. Is learn not to 
nuke to fast too soon. You do not want the mob sticking to you like glue, 
let your tanks do a decent amount of damage before you start timing your 
nukes. If done right, you'll not put yourself at risk of being smacked 
around by the mob.

<LI>You get your first skin spell at level 16, shieldskin. This spell 
involves using a component, and can add up to quite alot of $_$. Using this 
spell wisely can however save your life. Use it for times when you need to 
pull (Aye, wizards don't normally pull, but i'll comment on this later on). 
Another case is the "Amazing Resisted Root"
remember those times when you get pummeled to 1 or 2 bubs of hp trying to 
root a mob and it finally sticks? While cast this on yourself and now you 
can duke it out with the mob with a little less risk. It gets better as your 
skin line of spells gets upgraded. =)

<LI>Level 20, you get enstill, many people mistake this spell to be a root 
upgrade, it isn't. This spell is for holding a mob at his spot for quite 
some time. This is where wizards get to pull. No druids to harmony or 
enchanter to mesmerize that irritating pair of mobs? No probs, just get
our resident wizard, enstill a mob, the other aggros on you, run back and let 
your tanks do the work. I've actually have people tell me "Wow that mob is 
still standing there?" after we are done with the one i pulled. You can also 
use this in a mispull situation, just nuke the mob the tanks AREN'T killing, 
run to a corner, and enstill it. (Some people may say i'm crazy, i'm not, 
i've tried and tested this before. You just need to be good at it.)

<LI>Tishan's Clash, some love it, some hate it, i personally think this spell 
comes in pretty nifty. The Tishan-Root combo, can be used to save fellow 
casters in the group, or let the healers run off to get off a heal. Why 
bother clashing first? First it stuns mobs, so the person you trying to get 
the mob off can run off without getting hit in the back and getting that 
irritating "You are stunned!" msg. The tanks can also re-engage the mob, and 
within the short 3 seconds in which it is stunned. They most probably have 
taunted and done enough damage to stop the mob from going back to the 
caster/healer. If it still goes back your caster/healers are on crack.

<LI>Lastly, personal gates everywhere. Thats pretty self-explanatory =)
</OL>
</P>

[Advanced wizard information] Level 29-44<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>

<P>
At this point, you should be getting very good in being a wizard, but there 
are still things you need to learn. Of course you may have your own playing 
style by now, if thats the case you can probably find out these next few 
parts of info by yourselves. So here we go...
</P>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>Got your new spells, and you find out you have bonds of force! Or what 
i'ed call wizzie snare. Alot of people don't like this spell because they 
say that it breaks too often and is resisted often. Well get yourself an 
enchanter and now you can reverse kite. Even caster mobs with pets. 
Enchanter tashans and you time it right so bonds of force goes off right 
after tashan is cast. Then you enstill or immobolize the pet, while 
enchanter fears mob. Now you can nuke to your hearts content, and finish off 
the irritating pet later. Remove the part about the pet if you just doing it 
on normal stuff. ;')

<LI>You also get your first evac spell. I have people tell me, Evac when your 
enchanters tell you too. But sometimes, enchanters get too  big headed and 
think that they can control the huge crowd that came with the bad pull. 
Seriously, you need to judge when you need to evac yourself, because 
sometimes, you can chain cast so fast, you can drop a few mobs and turn the 
tide of the battle. (Just be sure to have enough mana for an evac)

<LI>You also get Nullify magic at lvl 34. Why would you use it since 
enchanters and even clerics have the same spell? Simply because clerics need 
to concentrate on healing, and enchanters crowd control. You have time to 
strip the buffs off the mob while you are waiting for the tanks to deal more 
damage (mentioned before, you don't want to pull the mob to you with an 
early nuke)

<LI>Circle of force, AE fire blast. This isn't as useless as all the last few 
AE spells you get the past levels. If you hear from people that AE spells 
will kill you. It isn't true, its the same as doing a DD too early, doing an 
AE spell too early will make you one dead wizard fast. If you target the mob 
your tank is hacking, once the mob gets to around 70% hp, cast this AE and 
even if it hits everything else attacking your tank (Which is what you want) 
they won't aggro on you. If you do get everything onto you, you should have 
an enchanter to AE mes the mess you made. =0 Get the timing down and you'll 
never aggro anything onto you.
</OL>
</P>

<H4>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
[The final stretch] Level 44-50 (Soon to be 60)<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>

<P>
Well, by this time, if you still don't know what a wizard is about LOL, quit 
playing one. Just add everything you have learnt in the past and you have 
what you need for the final stretch. Other stuff would be Plane info, dragon 
raids and stuff like that so you'ed need to experience that for yourself =)
</P>

<H4>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
[Good partners]<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>

<P>
I dunno about everyone else, but i like grabbing a partner and kicking butt 
together. So i've compiled a small section for good wizard partners =)
</P>

<P>
Enchanter/Wizard - Seriously, Enchanters are good with almost everyone. You 
can reverse kite with bonds of force and fear. The enchanter can also help 
with lowering MR, debuffing, stunning and messing if too many come at a 
time.
</P>

<P>
Druid/Wizard - Why would a druid partner with you instead of kiting? Well 
sometimes if a druid is in a dungeon and can't get into a group, you can 
grab him and partner for the blue/even mobs. Since they fixed druid root, 
they actually work pretty good now, and they can tank a little and heal when 
needed. The good thing about Druid/Wizard is regen/buffs and since both can 
evac, if one overpulls the other can port the other away. (Clerics can do 
this role pretty good, no evac but good heals buffs should be able to 
compensate)
</P>

<P>
Rogue/Wizard - Think i'm kidding? ;) Not really if you have a rogue about 
the same level as you, and is good at circle strafting, then you have a 
viable partner. Rogue starts with backstab, then starts piercing like crazy, 
wait a few secs then Tishan's clash, rogue CS behind mob backstab again. 
Then you start your nuking and Tishan's when the spell resets. Mobs won't 
stay long on you because having your back turned towards a rogue is never a 
good idea.
</P>

<P>
Mage or Necro/Wizard - Pet classes, well...it depends on the situation, but 
you most probably can't go wrong here, it depends on outdoor or indoor, and 
also what pet a mage summons, or what tactic a necro uses, you'll learn 
about these stuff from the them. =)
</P>

<P>
It is possible to partner well with the other classes, but it'll work out 
having lots of downtime. You can try, then tell me what you feel about this. 
</P>

<P>
=)<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Well this is the end of the guide i guess, there are other things i can talk 
about but i'm tired, getting pretty late here hehe. So well...hope i helped 
you understand us wizards a little more. =)
