Welcome to our fair city, broodling!
</P>

<P>
This guide will help you find what you seek in our city.  We have the finest supplies for any trades you wish to take up!  The Haggle Baron sets the prices to be fair on all but very few merchants, so you are guaranteed to get a good deal!
</P>

<P>
This guide has been divided off into two sections, <A HREF="vendors_west_cabilis.html">West Cabilis</A> and <A HREF="vendors_east_cabilis.html">East Cabilis</A>.
</P>

<P>
You will find in the pages some references to sketches of familiar buildings in our city, so that in your travels you will not get lost and waste valuable training hours.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="vendors_west_cabilis.html">West Cabilis</A> contains the Tower of Death as well as merchants that sell food, armor and fletching components
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="vendors_east_cabilis.html">East Cabilis</A> contains the Temple of Terror, Court of Pain, and the Legion of Cabilis.  This is really the heart of commerce in Cabilis, as the areas near the Haggle Baron have everything for sale, from needle and thread for the tailors among us, to packs, to clay and ore for other creations
