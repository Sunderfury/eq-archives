<P>
This Temple is home to our two clerical forces, the Scaled Mystics and the Crusaders of Greenmist.  Both use their casting skills to bring us victory!
</P>

<P>
Within the entry way of the Temple, to the left and right, you shall find shimmering teleport curtains that will take you above to the Crusaders of Greenmist and their trainers.  Take care going through these, for to run through these may be to run right off the top of the tower and plunge to injury.
