		June 27th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p><br>** Gameplay Changes **<p>- Aggro Changes:  We've made an adjustment to the way that NPCs choose their targets.  It's a rather simple change, one that makes a lot of sense.  But we want you to be aware of it so that it won't surprise you too much, and so that you won't think that it is a bug.  NPCs are now much more aware of the vulnerability (or, more precisely, the invulnerability) of their targets.  NPCs will now be very unlikely to waste their time attacking a target that they can't harm.<p>- Spell and Item Interruption:  Ducking will now interrupt a spell instantly.  You will no longer be able to sit while using items or casting spells.  This will not affect bard songs, which will still work as they always have, but will affect all items, even those with song-like effects.<p><br>** Spell Changes **<p>- Skin Like Nature and Natureskin should stack with more spells now (though not with each other).<p>- Aegolism can now be clicked off.<p>- Imbue Ivory has had its casting level lowered to 29.<p>- Shard of the Core will be tradable now.<p>- Shroud of Hate and Visions of Grandeur should stack properly now.<p>- Several new Translocation spells have been added.<p>- Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' hatelists if the target is not summoned far enough.<p>- Egress will now work indoors.<p>- Wind of the North, Wind of the South, Markar's Relocation and Tishan's Relocation have had their additional restrictions removed, and can now be cast from any zone where other similar spells can be cast.<p>- Summon Companion can now be used by Necromancers, Shamans, Enchanters, Shadowknights in addition to Magicians.<p>- Deadeye should now stack with Dead Man Floating, but should not stack with Acumen.<p>- Plainsight will now stack with Dead Man Floating, but not with Acumen.<p>- The Great Divide portal spells are now 39th level instead of 44th level.<p>- Spirit of the Oak will no longer be overwritten by any beneficial spells.<p>- Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct damage spells.<p>- Hsagra's Wrath and Porlos' Fury now have a 5 second recast delay.<p><br>** Item Changes **<p>- The effect on the 10th ring should have fewer stacking conflicts with haste buffs. <p>- The effect of the Monk epic, Celestial Tranquility, will stack with the higher end haste spells. Keep in mind - the highest haste will always win out.  This means that the spells will stack, the haste components will not.<p>- Speed of the Shissar has had its duration increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.  This effect should no longer conflict with Call of Earth.<p>- Bone Ring of Condemnation will no longer be usable in the secondary slot, it will only be wearable on the finger.<p>- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look more unique.<p>- Circlet of Shadow will no longer drop in-game.  The Circlet of Shadows, can now be found in its place.  This item differs from the original only in that it has a five-second casting time.  Existing Circlets of Shadow will retain the same functionality as before, though we may change existing Circlets at some future date.<p><br>** Quest Changes **<p>- King Tormax is now a little more particular about who he gives quests to.<p>- The Iksar Shaman 6th Skull/cudgel quest should be working now. <p>- Rumor has it that there is a new source for green dragon scales in Norrath.<p><br>** PvP Changes **<p>- If you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be looted.<p>- When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other player that had them targeted will lose their target.  This is true for all servers, but has the greatest implications on PvP servers.  The use of spells that allow you to see through invisibility will prevent you from losing your target if that target hides or goes invisible.<p>- Faction hits on Rallos Zek:  Killing a person in one of his or her home cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.<p><br>** Miscellaneous **<p>- We've addressed a lot of spelling and grammatical errors over the past few weeks.  For example we have corrected all misspellings of "deity" in messages to the player, changed Cantana to Cantata and others.<p>- The 'Fab Four' in Dagnor's Cauldron will no longer assist Undertow Skeletons.<br> <br>- Instill Doubt/Intimidation can no longer be used while sitting, and sitting after starting it will cancel it.<br> <br>- Mastery of language skills now occurs at 100, not at 101.  This was a problem for masters of a language, since language skills could not go over 100.<p>- The messages for eating and drinking now say "Chomp... Chomp," or "Glug... Glug..." so that they can't be copied with emotes.<p>- Helms on Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres should no longer block the first person view when in combat. <p>- Sirens Grotto has been changed a bit.  It should be a more interesting zone now.<p><br>** NOTE **<p>Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers.  Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their home town.<p><br>- The EverQuest Team<p>

		We thought you may like something to read while waiting out the 13hour patch..<p><EM><p>*** Patch Message ***<p><br>** Zone Changes **<p>- Runnyeye has been changed.  Something is up in Goblin land...<p><br>** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<p>- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code.  For the most <br>part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to <br>stack that were never intended to stack.<p>- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<p>- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of <br>Cazic Thule can scribe it.<p>- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been <br>changed to be more appropriate.<p><p>** Features and Interface Changes **<p>- The variable %t will now work with /assist.  So you can use /assist %t <br>if you wish.  Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist <br>without the %t.<p>- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.<p>- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to <br>user color 15 (same as other skill messages).  The success message <br>was already set to user color 15.<p>- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does.  <br>It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server.  The new <br>ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list <br>(<character name>_<#>.ini).  The first time a character is created or <br>loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old <br>ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.<p>- The Alt key now works in several new situations.  It will now show <br>item names when in the trade window.  Because the trade items of the <br>local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item <br>names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player <br>positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade <br>window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade <br>item names.<p>- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.<p>- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse <br>items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.<p>- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when <br>held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they <br>don't show up otherwise).<p>- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any <br>player that is on your /ignore list.  Some players were using this <br>to annoy players that had ignored them.<p>- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are <br>on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to <br>annoy people that had ignored them).<p>- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the <br>members of your guild in your zone.  You can also specify a guild name, <br>such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".<p>- /safelock command added.  /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface <br>(mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash <br>commands) with the password that you supply to the command.  You must use <br>this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the <br>interface.  Passwords are NOT case-sensitive.  So to lock your interface, <br>you would type /safelock password.  You would do the same to unlock it.  <br>REMEMBER:  If you forget what password you typed, you will need to <br>reboot your machine.<p><br>** Item Changes **<p>- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now <br>also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<p>- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.<p>- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of <br>your waist.<p>- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop.  <br>They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <p>- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable.  <br>There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so <br>we had to disable that for these items.<p>- Sewing Kits:  No existing sewing kits are being changed with this <br>patch.  But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different.  <br>Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots.  Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 <br>slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.<p>- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty <br>blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.<p><br>**  Other Stuff **<p>- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level <br>bard title.  :)<p>- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with <br>that of his counterparts in Velious.  This is not the sort of thing <br>that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that <br>nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest.  We're <br>announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.<p><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></EM>

		March 14th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>***EverQuest Turns Two***<p>Two years ago this Friday, EverQuest was launched, forever changing the course of online gaming.  Today EverQuest boasts nearly 360,000 active subscribers, and a two-year retention rate of 65%.  Peak usage tops 89,000 simultaneous users with average peak usage at roughly 87,000.  The EverQuest community continues to grow daily.  <p>We've put up a page on the EverQuest website to help celebrate EverQuest's achievement and to thank our loyal fans.  Over the next couple of days we will be posting interesting content from EverQuest's humble beginnings, as well as a few surprises.  Check it out!  http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp<p>*Ever Changing, Evolving, Expanding*<p>The Warrens:<p>As part of our two-year celebration, we're pleased to announce the release of "The Warrens", a free expansion zone located on Odus. "The Warrens" is a low-to-mid level dungeon and the home of the Kobolds on Odus.  You can patch the Warrens by running the "Optional Patch". <p>In addition to filling-out the continent of Odus, "the Warrens" will also serve as a platform to try out some of the new ideas brought forth by members of the team and the public aimed at addressing some common gameplay issues.  We would like to see what options might be open to and enjoyed by the players in the future.<p>The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher level characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level creatures.  To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that "outclasses" a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP.  All other loot will drop.  "Outclassing" a foe is defined as having a group makeup such that no one in your group receives experience from the kill.  This can happen if, for instance, the foe is "green" to all group members, or if the group makeup is of such a wide level range that the system determines the fight was unbalanced using regular experience rules.<p>Any time that an NPC would have dropped special loot and does not due to it being outclassed, a message indicating that the combat was "trivial" will be displayed to the group. <p>As time goes on, we will be implementing new gameplay subsets and adjustements in the Warrens.  Please be sure to let us know what you think!<p>The Planes:<br> <br>The Planes of Fear and Hate have been updated as part of our two-year celebration.  Adventurers in the Plane of Fear will notice that some high-level foes are now available.  Rewards for former "boss npcs" have been moved down to underlings that are roughly as powerful as the old bosses were.<p>The Plane of Hate has also received a large update, but this one also includes the opening of a previously undiscovered part of the zone, now full high-level expansion-oriented content.  Much as with Fear, rewards from bosses have been moved.  <p>Epic Quests:<p>As part of the Plane updates, we've made several adjustments to Epic quests for a number of classes.  Previously, questers of many classes were put in direct competition with regular non-questing adventurers for a few coveted spawns.  In these cases, a new step has been added to separate the "Epic Encounter" NPCs from the "Epic Quest" NPCs.  <p>For those who are mid-quest, all quest requirements have remained the same.  In other words, if you turn the same items into the same NPC, the same reward applies.  What has changed is that some components may be in a different location from where you expect them.  It is recommended that you check with the last NPC in line or other adventurers to find where you need to go next.<p>***Patch Day***<p>Along with the big announcements above, today was a patch day as well:<p>- Fixed a bug that allowed exploitation of the period of time between character control being established and loading of character faction tables.<br>- Fixed the Dagger of Frost.  Its special item flags were improperly removed in the last patch.<br>- The spell, Mark of Karn, has been enhanced to heal more per hit.<br>- The effect on the Celestial Elixir Breastplates has been changed to the enhanced Mark of Karn.  The casting time on these items has also been changed to 9 seconds.<br>- NPCs in Thurgadin will no longer stop traveling when you /hail them.<br>- Fixed a problem present in Nagafen's Lair and the Plane of Hate that caused framerate to drop over time.<br>- Shift-clicking on a stack of items will cause you to pick up the whole stack.  This is in addition to CTRL-clicking on a stack, which will cause you to pick up one.  These both also work for coins now as well as items.<br>- In addition to the above, holding down the shift key while clicking the "Sell" button in the vendor screen will cause you to sell the entire stack of items if a stack is selected.  For example, you can sell 20 peridots by selecting the stack, and shift-clicking "Sell".  I'd recommend though that you give them to your neighborhood cleric first though :)  The ability to buy stacks is on the list for implementation in the near future.<br>- There are a ton of new recipies for trade skill users out there.  Check your books.  <br>- There are a bunch of new quests as well.<br>- It appears that we fixed a bug with the Mend skill that caused it to be unavailable for a few seconds after it was supposed to be ready for use.  Let us know if there are any further problems.<br>- Foraging items will now yield a message giving you some idea of what you've foraged.<p>Please remember that the /movelog for the Rathe and E'ci is scheduled for this weekend.  Please read the message below for details on the /movelog.<p>*A Message From Customer Service*<p>We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters moved from one server to another, or from one account to another.  Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and other problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters across servers or accounts.  <p>It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server remain on that server.  We also feel that it is important that characters that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from that reputation by changing servers.<p>The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a large number of characters to new servers.  At no other time will we move a character in such a fashion.<p>- The EverQuest Team<br>

Go to http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire for details.<p><br>***Patch Day***<p>*General Changes*<p>-- Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200. <br>-- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal's Breatplate on others once casted upon yourself.<br>-- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs<br>-- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book or alt+b.<br>-- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.<br>-- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on Antonica and two others on Kunark.  NPCs at these locations can fill you in on the details.  Good hunting.<br>-- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the "Celestial Healing" effect has been increased to one minute.  We understand that this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch.  We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on the group tank.  When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those items retroactively.  <br>-- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill values over 100.  Values under 100 still show the qualitative identifiers.<br>-- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other players.  You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players by typing /inspect. <br>-- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over the chat window.<br>-- Fixed "Breath of the Sea". It was mistakenly set to be unresistable.<br>-- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone.  This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists and clean up your pet.<br>-- "Voice Graft" will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of your pet.<br>-- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.<br>-- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125.  It was the intent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better.  With the tracking improvements from the last patch, this increase was appropriate.<br>-- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.<p>*NPC AI Adjustments*<p>-- Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt creatures that are level 60 to 65.  Previously, players could only taunt creatures below their level.<br>-- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies.  Prior to this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this.  This is why NPCs would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.<br>-- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much "temporary hate" when a player would sit down in front of them.<br>-- The maximum amount of "hate" that an NPC can add when witnessing a heal to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<br>-- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number of hitpoints healed.  Previously, healing one hitpoint would cause one point of hate.  Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate.<p>*Velious Music*<p>Velious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood music for some Velious Zones.  Let us know what you think of the new compositions. <p>*EQGems*<p>A new "mini-game" has been added to the EverQuest client.  EQGems is our first effort aimed towards allowing people to engage in different activities while playing EverQuest.  Based upon the success of EQGems, we may explore opportunities for other mini-games in the future, even some that are multiplayer in and of themselves.  Type /gems to play.<p>- The EverQuest Team<p>
