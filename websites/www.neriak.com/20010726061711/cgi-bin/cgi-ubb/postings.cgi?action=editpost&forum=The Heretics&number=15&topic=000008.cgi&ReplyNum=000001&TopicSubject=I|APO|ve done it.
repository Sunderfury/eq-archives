<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">As a level 38 cleric I still cant solo the guards because of their LOHs and greater heals.  I grouped with a level 35 mage who said she could solo them with no problem and it takes her about 30 secs a kill.  I did find a way to kill them solo...but it takes me about 15 min. for each kill.  Enter eruding from tox forrest.  Go up teleporter, find a solo guard, careful not to get two. Guard Tyrol (or something) is usually wandering around or you can try a risky pull from the building on the right.  Attack and pull him to the teleporter (notice how there are no female guards, strange).  Fight him at teleporter and try to get him to half so he uses his lay on hands. Jump on teleporter to lower  level.  Guard will not follow.  Meditate and heal.  Round two.  Go back onto teleporter and guard will immediately attack you...probably with half health if you managed to do any damage after he LOH.  Continue attacking until you kill him...if you get in trouble use the teleporter to heal and med...he will eventually run out of mana.  As a side note...make sure you have an escape plan..after killing just 2 guards you will be KOS.  The first time I went KOS with these guys I was  bound inside the city and had to wait for someone to invis me so I could get out..heh.  Also, I found that I could only kill about 10 guards (thats a guess) before I stopped getting faction with the Heretics.  I submitted a bug report but I'm guessing this is just another lame attempt by verrant of screwing with evil characters.  Also, pack some supplies...you wont be able to buy food from erudin and even when you become dubious with paineel the merchants will not sell to you.  However, if you are well supplied, these guards make for excellent experience if solo'd or grouped and give a few pp.  I found that the guards with the staffs are a push over and I could solo them at lvl 37 (using the above tactics).  The guards with fine steel rapiers, daggers etc. are very tough.  I do not consider this a cheat, lets face it, if a cleric can't kill a mob that a mage can kill easily 3 levels below you (I saw her do it), then you need some added help.  Chance are you wont be able to get a group unless you know a high level necro willing to kill some time with you. How many people are willing to lose faction with erudin just cause some evil cleric wants to get into paineel...very few...so you have to resort to soloing for the most part.  How I wish I had chosen a non evil cleric...Verrant screwed us evil characters so badly.  I look at the paineel quests and I say, now they really look interesting...who cares about how good or bad the items are, but the quests sound like fun.  Then I look at the Bertoxxulous qeynos quests and realise that there really isnt and comparison.  Sure killing Milea Clothspinner was fun the first dozen or so times...but that gets old real fast..heh.  What I wouldnt give for a couple of cool quests in my own guild...just to hear that trumpet when the quest is completed and to know that I have pleased my diety.  Give us that at least.</TEXTAREA>
