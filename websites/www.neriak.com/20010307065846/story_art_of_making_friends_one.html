<P>
The most perilous thing about fighting orcs is the horror of their 
breath.  This, I believe, should be written down somewhere so adventurous 
souls may take precautions.  A veil, soaked in something strong and bracing, 
would seem in order.  Or perhaps a magicked garment of some sort.  Yes, there 
very well might be considerable platinum in this notion, if it were properly 
exploited, er ... marketed.  
</P>

<P>
Unfortunately, I had no time at the present to consider this project, 
seeing as how I was fighting for my life.  Certainly, I mused to myself as I 
barely parried the centurion's blow, orcs are uncomfortably strong.  Quite 
resilient too, I noted, as my opponent hardly winced when my dragoon dirk bit 
deeply into its shoulder.  Fortunately, however, orcs are also extremely 
predictable and considerably prone towards rashness.  Pivoting with what 
grace remained in me, I retreated far enough to send a shuriken into the 
creature's left eye.  Screaming in pain, the orc rushed at me wildly.  I 
angled in under its vicious slash and permitted the wretched beastie to have 
the singular honor of impaling itself fully onto the point of my rapier.  I 
registered the almost comical look of surprise on the orc's twisted face as 
we embraced, some two and a half feet of my blade sticking bloodily out of 
its back like a gruesome horn.  The full force of the centurion's dying 
exhale took me square in the face before gravity and the waiting earth 
claimed its body.  My eyes crossed and I very nearly joined it on the ground 
in a dead faint.  
</P>

<P>
I reiterate: the breath of an orc could knock a vulture with a cold off 
of a dung-wagon.  Feh.
</P>

<P>
Battered and bleeding, I was nevertheless triumphant amid the strewn 
corpses of my opponents.  The stillness of the moment was broken asunder as a 
bloodthirsting roar forced my weary bones to turn my aching body around to 
its source.  Fate had perversely chosen this precise moment to lure a young 
but lethal and quite unreasonably angry kodiak bear directly to the spot 
where I was unsteadily standing.
</P>

<P>
Ah, well.  It had been fun while it lasted.
</P>

SCENE 1: NERIAK, ONE SEVENDAY AGO
</P>

<P>
Simple courier duty.  That was to have been the assignment.  I remember 
all too well that night at the Hall of the Ebon Mask, when Tani N'Mar asked 
me if I would care to share a bottle of To'Biath merlot with him at the 
Maiden's Fancy.  Naturally, I was suspicious.  But my coffers at that time 
were very nearly empty, and I could feel that wonderful urge for mischief 
welling deep within me.  The thought of an assignment at that time was as 
irresistible to me as a library pass is to an Erudite.
</P>

<P>
More fool I.
</P>

<P>
N'Mar was as good as his word: the merlot was outstanding, if a bit 
young.  I savored its warming kiss, awaiting the moment when N'Mar would 
choose to tell me what he wanted.  Thankfully, he came to the point fairly 
quickly.  This, in and of itself, plucked at my danger strings.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Well now, young Szardos,&quot; he began casually, &quot;Are you professionally 
engaged at the moment?&quot;
</P>

<P>
The diabolical louse knew perfectly well that I was not.  The game needs 
must be played, however.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Nothing that cannot be severed or postponed, ... given the proper 
opportunity.&quot;  I replied carefully.
</P>

<P>
N'Mar smiled.  The nights in Everfrost had more warmth.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Can I can persuade you to do just that for, say, 20 platinum pieces?&quot; 
he inquired casually.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I am listening, Elder N'Mar.&quot;
</P>

<P>
N'Mar poured me another glass of wine.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I have an informant in Freeport who has come across a very interesting 
document.  One that pertains to the Faydark Enterprise.  I require a courier 
to retrieve from him this document and return it to me immediately.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I regarded the blood-hued depths of my wineglass before answering.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Elder N'Mar,&quot; I drawled, &quot;Why are you offering to pay 20 platinum 
pieces for a simple milk run?  There are neophytes in the Hall who would 
cheerfully perform this simple task for a mere handful of gold.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;What,&quot; I asked him, meeting him square into his scheming eyes, &quot;Are you 
not telling me?&quot;
</P>

<P>
N'Mar leaned back in his chair, casting an appreciative look at the 
dancers at the bar.  One in particular, a lean and talented new addition to 
the Fancy,  undulated as if there was not a single bone in the perfection of 
her indigo body.  I made a mental note to myself that I should endeavor to 
investigate as to whether or not that was the case some fine evening in the 
very near future.
</P>

<P>
&quot;My informant,&quot; N'Mar murmured, shaking me out of my reverie, &quot;Is a 
Knight of Truth.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I came very close to choking on my wine.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You have corrupted a Paladin of Marr?&quot; I rasped incredulously, wiping 
my mouth.
</P>

<P>
&quot;It's been done before.&quot; he replied easily.  &quot;What do you think the 
Captain of the Militia used to be?&quot;
</P>

<P>
I knew the rumor regarding Sir Lucan's past as well as any other on 
Norrath.  I even knew it to be the truth.  Even so, a corrupt paladin was a 
rare as a halfling in ballet slippers.  N'Mar must be an absolute genius to 
have managed to subvert one ... or else simply willing to sacrifice a pawn in 
the hopes that his informant and his alleged document were genuine.
</P>

<P>
N'Mar played with the rim of his wineglass.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Thirty platinum, young Szardos,&quot; he stated flatly.  &quot;Fifteen merely for 
accepting.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, the role of the pawn this evening will be played by 
yours truly.
</P>

<P>
Enjoy the show.
</P>

<P>
SCENE 2: FREEPORT, FOUR DAYS AGO
</P>

<P>
I remember well my first visit to the City of Freeport.  My superiors had 
instructed me to use the secret tunnels in order to avoid danger, as I would 
be new to the guards.  The problem was, I had this new doublet, and the 
thought of exposing its pristine (not to mention costly) elegance to the 
filth and stench of the sewers was positively abhorrent to me.  So I merely 
caused a diversion at the front gates (honestly, I hardly wounded that 
wretched, so-called High Elf to make him squeal so) , and snuck past the 
guards as they left their post.  T'was a most interesting assignment, 
involving the monthly take, and I quickly learned enough about the Freeport 
citizenry to do many of them numerous favors over time.  Today, I walk 
through Freeport with impunity.  Indeed, this beautifully corrupt Human city 
can be said to be my second home.
</P>

<P>
The Knights or Truth, however, are another matter.  These paladins 
control North Freeport with swords and spells, you see.  I have performed 
several small services on their behalf, enough so that I am known to them and 
(thankfully) not attacked on sight, but nowhere near enough for them to buy 
me a drink and introduce me to their charming sisters.  And here I was, idiot 
that I am, about to venture forth into an assignment that could jeopardize 
what little goodwill I had acquired over time.  Ah, well.  Let the dice fly 
high, I always say.
</P>

<P>
The guards at the gate greeted me amiably.  Fine fellows, these 
militiamen.  Good fighters, strong drinkers, poor gamblers, and every single 
man jack of them for sale.  Could a Rogue ask for better in a policeman?  I 
think not.  We talked for a few minutes, exchanging pleasantries and gossip.  
Apparently, a shipment of weapons belonging to the Steel Warriors had gone 
astray.  Investigations into this were proceeding with the usual laxity.  I 
noted well the names of the newcomers to the city the guards provided, and 
assured them that Neriak's monthly contribution to their 'Widows and 
Orphan's Committee' would arrive on schedule.  T'was with real regret that I 
left the guards behind and walked the path to the narrow passage that led to 
North Freeport, and my objective.
</P>

<P>
Not ten feet into North Freeport, I came across a paladin.  He was not 
pleased to see me.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Greetings and salutations to you, Sir Hallis,&quot; I said cheerily.
</P>

<P>
The pompous bastard grunted in reply, and treated me to an icy stare and 
the pointed tip of his rather large sword against my throat.
</P>

<P>
&quot;What's your business here, Szardos?&quot; He demanded bluntly.
</P>

<P>
I carefully pulled back my cloak, revealing a dented, bloodstained 
militia helmet under my arm.  I watched with satisfaction as the 
self-righteous oaf's eyes widened at the sight of it, and let my muscles 
slowly untense as he sheathed his battle-sharp sword. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;I am merely here to rest my weary bones for the night in the safety of 
your proud walls,&quot; I told him airily, &quot;Perhaps purchase a few items for my 
travels.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;And to pay my respects your superiors,&quot; I added in a sly whisper, 
patting the battered helmet gently.
</P>

<P>
The paladin's lips curled upwards with a genuine, feral pleasure.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Which one of those corrupt swine did you kill for this prize?&quot; He asked 
quietly, eyes gleaming.     I let my cloak fall forward again to conceal the 
helmet and raised a hand to my mouth in mock horror.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Why, Most Noble Knight,&quot; I cried theatrically, &quot;Certainly I must be 
mistaken.  Surely you do not ask that I confess to some heinous murder I know 
nothing about?&quot;
</P>

<P>
Grinning conspiratorially, Sir Hallis shook his head.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Oh, of course not, Szardos,&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;Forgive me if I gave you 
that impression.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Not at all.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The Knight of Truth stepped aside, waving a heavy armored gauntlet at me.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Pass within, Dark Rogue,&quot; the paragon told me.  &quot;You are welcome in 
North Freeport.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I bowed deeply and gracefully.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Most kind,&quot; I replied.
</P>

<P>
If that self-important ox had known the history of my militia helmet, he 
would have no doubt gutted me on the spot.  Guard Valon, tollman of the West 
Commonlands and pride of the Freeport Militia, had given me this particular 
helmet only last month.  It was a spare from the armory I accepted from him 
in lieu of a sizable gambling debt (a doughty fighter, for a human, Valon's 
face is as easily read as if the cards themselves were nailed to his 
forehead.  Unfortunate for him, but fortunate for me).  I then took the 
helmet to the East Commonlands, threw a half dozen rocks at it, splashed it 
with wolf's blood, and let it dry in the sun for a threeday in order to give 
it a certain &quot;battlefield&quot; patina.  If that idiot of a Paladin wished to 
assume that I had killed a militiaman for it, such a perversion of his 
fevered and diseased imagination was of course his privilege.  After all, I 
at no time told him anything whatsoever about the helmet.  Indeed, I was 
positively outraged at his thinking that I had engaged at such a dastardly 
deed.
</P>

<P>
And they say that the truth is worthless to rogues.  
</P>

<P>
Hah, I say.
</P>

<P>
I rented a room for the night at Tassle's Tavern and set out to scout 
North Freeport.  The meeting between myself and the informant would not take 
place until tomorrow evening, and I had the advantage: I knew his identity, 
but he knew nothing of me.  The exchange would be based upon code phrases 
alone.  While I took care of mundane matters (such as the purchase of 
provisions and throwing weapons), I began consulting a number of individuals 
about various paladins, in an attempt to learn about N'Mar's informant in a 
roundabout way.  Young Jasud was a relatively new Knight, according to the 
gossip, not yet four months a paladin.  He was reputed to be quite earnest in 
manner, bordering on the fanatical.  He was not well-liked by the residents, 
who found him harsh and disdainful.  One source in particular had a very 
interesting story to tell after I loosened his tongue with some gold: While 
being 'escorted' by two Knights of Truth to the cells to sleep off an 
evening's carouse, he overheard them discussing young Jasud.  They were 
rather resentful of his ambition, as he was 'being groomed for special 
things,' whilst they were still patrolling the same streets, dealing with 
'small-time crooks and drunks'.  Special things indeed.  A sense of 
foreboding began to grow within me regarding young Jasud.  The term 
'double-agent' came to mind several times during my ruminations.  I felt it 
was time to have a drink and a think regarding my next move.
</P>

<P>
Tassel's was moderately busy that evening.  The usual motley array of 
adventurers and townsfolk milled about, trying to pass the evening in warmth 
and companionship.  I placed my elbows onto the bar, and gathered resolve 
from its steady, heavily varnished surface.  Something reeked about young 
Jasud; I needed to plan.  As the Barman's young daughter brought me my wine, 
I observed age-old rituals of courtship, potential partners for the evening 
being sized up, rejected, and sought after.  The women paid little attention 
to the words being said.  They merely smiled patiently, with respect for the 
time-honored game, their minds made up well before the candidate even opened 
his mouth.  I saw plots hatching, alliances being made and broken, and souls 
numbing their despair in drink.  I saw fingers tapping, impatient for the 
unknown to hurry up and arrive.  Here we are, I mused, all of us alone in the 
dark, nesting in swirls of aimless conversation and fragrant, twisting 
ribbons of pipe smoke.  Accompanied or alone, good or evil, our only 
connection is that we wish at this moment to be among people.  I raised my 
glass in a mock salute to my reflection in the long bar mirror, and drank 
deeply of life.
</P>

<P>
As I drank, I felt someone staring at me.  In truth,  I could feel a pair 
of eyes all but branding me in the back.  Such instincts keep one alive in my 
profession, and mine are very well honed indeed.  Had my mission been 
compromised somehow?  All things are possible, Mischief Knows.  Forcing 
myself to move nonchalantly, I adjusted my cloak, my fingers running lightly 
over the various nasty things I carry secreted upon my person for 
emergencies.  Palming a shuriken, I slowly turned around.  My eyes wandered 
unfocused along the occupants of the tavern, coming to rest at a table in the 
corner.  There, all alone, sat a sizable barbarian warrioress.  Our gazes 
locked for a very long time.  Then she brazenly looked me up and down, as if 
she was selecting a lobster for her dinner.  A tiny smile curled the ends of 
her thin lips, and she slowly drew her shoulders back and inhaled deeply, 
displaying her ample charms to the threat of snapping the fastenings of her 
armor.  Intrigued, I sauntered over to her table, watching her eyes glisten 
ever the brighter with my proximity.  She bared a generous mouth of strong 
white teeth to me in a welcome albeit challenging smile.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Good evening, Blueskin,&quot; she said in a deep purr.  &quot;Share my table.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I inclined my head to her respectfully.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Most kind.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Sitting down, I took a greater inventory of my striking new companion.  
She was, like all of her race, uncomfortably tall.  Her face was strong-jawed 
and tanned from the sun, handsome rather than beautiful, and rife with 
character evident of having led an interesting life.  Her body was 
unashamedly magnificent: a dizzying array of lush, rounded curves and lean, 
powerful muscle, restrained at present by battle-worn leathers and 
ill-polished chainmail.  Her posture appeared relaxed and casual, but it was 
clearly designed to seduce.  Indeed, her quite remarkable assets were pointed 
purposely at me, like advance scouts before an invading army.  Her legs 
crossed deeply as she took in my growing regard, revealing a mile or so of 
shapely thigh.  By Bristlebane's ballocks, I could actually feel my mouth 
begin to dry as I contemplated her, and I took a slow sip of my wine to 
moisten my lips.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You like what you see, Dark Elf?&quot; she asked me huskily.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I know now what the Warlord feels when he beholds a battle of great 
odds,&quot; I replied quietly.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Good,&quot; she said, pleased with my answer.  &quot;Now buy me a drink.&quot;
</P>

<P>
My brows climbed northwards, impressed with her boldness.
</P>

<P>
She again treated me to her dazzling smile.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You do not wish to buy me a drink?&quot;  Her tone was coy, but her eyes 
were growing dangerously bright.
</P>

<P>
&quot;On the contrary,&quot;  I reassured her.  &quot;It would make the decade 
worthwhile.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Her smile grew an inch wider and several degrees warmer.
</P>

<P>
Several drinks and much small talk later, we found ourselves heading to 
her room upstairs.  I let her lead the way, still wary of some form of 
ambush.  Watching her walk up the stairs was an absolute delight, as she 
swayed provocatively to and fro, like the well-rounded pendulum of a majestic 
clock.  By the time we reached her door, I had made a definite decision 
regarding her.
</P>

<P>
Unlocking the door, she turned and shot me a predatory grin.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Come in, Dark One,&quot; she challenged, &quot;And let us see how roguish you 
truly are.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I followed her in, quietly closing the door behind me. Taking me in her 
arms, she leaned down and shared with me the fire of her lips.  The kiss was 
long and luxuriant and perfect.  Breaking gently away, I smiled up into her 
glittering eyes and sighed.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You have positively outdone yourself this time, Enoyna.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The barbarian stiffened and her eyes widened with surprise.
</P>

<P>
&quot;What did you call me?&quot; she growled uncertainly.
</P>

<P>
I chuckled in reply.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Enoyna,&quot; I drawled.  &quot;Lovely, devious, exquisite Enoyna, enchantress 
extraordinary and bottomless bag of tricks.  I swear by all the gods, my 
dear, I would not be at all surprised to learn that Bristlebane himself had 
sired you.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The barbarian shook her head in wonder and slowly melted away into the 
dainty but flawless figure of the Tier'Dal enchantress I knew and unabashedly 
adored.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Caught and confessed, o peerless intriguer,&quot; she laughed.  &quot;What gave 
me away?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;For one thing,&quot; I began, &quot;Only the most jaded barbarian woman would 
take so lusty an interest in a Teir'Dal gentleman, my own (ahem) personal 
magnetism notwithstanding.  Truthfully, I first suspected that you were the 
attractive lure for some dastardly form of ambush.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I know,&quot; she grinned, her ice-blue eyes twinkling merrily. &quot;I saw you 
palm that throwing star before you approached me. I was most relieved to see 
you return it to your cloak.&quot;  She lifted a delicate eyebrow at me, her slim 
hands firmly on her hips, head cocked to the side.  &quot;What else?  Surely you 
based your determination upon more evidence than that.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Barbarians smell of leather, sweat and steel,&quot; I told her.  &quot;You 
smelled considerably better, my dear.&quot;
</P>

<P>
She dimpled and curtsied in acknowledgment.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Finally,&quot; I concluded, &quot;And most tellingly, it always comes down to 
movements, my sweet.  You can change your form, you can change your voice, 
but your movements are immistakable.  No one, Enoyna love, no one walks up a 
flight of stairs quite the way you do.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Flatterer.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; I countered.  &quot;Flattery consists of pretty lies.  What I say 
is absolute truth.  If you don't believe my words, there are other parts of 
me incapable of falsehoods where your charms are concerned.&quot;
</P>

<P>
She smiled and cast her eyes downwards.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Indeed there are,&quot; she acknowledged in a light purr.  &quot;One such part is 
coming to mind.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;What are you doing in North Freeport, Enoyna?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Hmmn?&quot;  she said distractedly.  &quot;Oh. That.  I heard word from my old 
instructor of the existence of an item of magical power, a Stein of some 
sort.  A bartender in Freeport reportedly has a lead on it.  I've slowly been 
drinking my way through the taverns of Freeport to locate him or her.  How 
about you?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;An assignment.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Which you can't talk about, naturally.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Naturally.&quot;
</P>

<P>
She giggled.  The sound caressed my ears as it always had, like music off 
a crystal harpsichord.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You haven't changed, Szardos,&quot; she said admiringly.  &quot;You're still an 
infuriating well of secrets.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I bowed.
</P>

<P>
&quot;It's good to see you again,&quot; she whispered, as she slowly approached me 
with a pantherish swinging of her hips.  By the Ten Fingers of Cunning, 
Enoyna should have been born with a tail.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Stay with me tonight,&quot; she demanded gently.
</P>

<P>
&quot;A pleasure.&quot; I assured her with my voice.  My hands began assuring her 
in other delightful ways.
</P>

<P>
She sighed softly and shimmered once more.  I now held a stunning High 
Elf woman in my arms, looking at me hungrily and slipping moonlight-pale arms 
around my neck as she drew her lovely alabaster face to mine.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Something new?&quot; I asked her.
</P>

<P>
The tall Elf smiled, eyes dancing.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I know you like variety.&quot;
</P>
