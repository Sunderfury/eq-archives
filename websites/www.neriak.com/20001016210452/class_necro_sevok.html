<H4>Introduction</H4>

<P>
Among the four &quot;pure&quot; casting classes, the Necromancer is perhaps the 
most unusual, with the Enchanter being a close second.  Wizards are pretty 
straightforward -- they beat the crap out of things in very short order; 
Magicians are basically a weakened Wizard with a pet to make up for it; 
Enchanters get some awesome buffs and debuffs, and a near-worthless animation as 
a pet that they can't even control; Necromancers get some incredibly wicked 
Damage Over Time (DOT) spells, a very powerful pet, the ability to charm the 
undead or ward them back into the grave, and some very good personal buff 
spells.  Playing a Necromancer is not like playing any other casting class.
</P>

<P>
This guide is meant to be used in conjunction with the Necromancer spell listing 
at <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">Casters Realm</A> [clickable].  That 
site contains an exact, detailed list of all spells you receive, with accurate 
damage statistics and so forth.  I won't list the names of each pet spell, for 
instance; you can instead can that information from Casters Realm.
</P>

<H4>Creating your Corpse-hugger :)</H4>

<P>
If druids are tree-huggers, then Necromancers are corpse-huggers.  Or 
corpse-makers, depending on how you look at it.
</P>

<P>
Anyway, creating a Necromancer character is very simple.  For Race, choose Dark 
Elf.  Other races can be Necromancers, sure -- Humans (Welcome to Mediocrity!), 
Gnomes (walking footstools), and Erudites (bah), but those races hate their 
Necromancers and even in your own hometown you would be shunned.  On the other 
hand, Necromancers are honored and revered in Teir'dal society and are loved in 
all of Neriak.  Additionally, Dark Elves have the second highest starting 
Intelligence among all races, making them excellent casters.  So, choose Dark 
Elf.  For Stat allotment, simply put all you can into Intelligence.  No 
reason to argue -- INT equals Mana equals your power to hurt MOBs and 
thereby gain experience and wealth.  More mana, more killing, less  downtime, 
end of story. :)  Deity, Innoruuk (only choice); starting town Neriak (also only 
choice).  You'll get a warning about this race/class/deity combo being of high 
difficulty, accept that and realize the path of the Necromancer is never an easy 
one.
</P>

<P>
After doing all of that and logging in as your Necromancer, do the normal new 
character stuff -- your guild quest, scribing and memming your first two spells, 
and so forth.  This isn't a beginner's EQ guide, you should already know these 
steps, if not, then read a more basic guide to EQ.
</P>

<H4>Early Strategies</H4>

<P>
Once you earn enough money killing the standard newbie creatures and selling 
their loot, start buying up your level 1 spells.  First buy the level 1 pet 
spell (Cavorting Bones), then the rest of the spells.  Your level 1 pet frankly 
sucks but it's better than nothing and will train you on how to use a pet, 
which you're going to be doing for the rest of your life, so use it at all 
times.  
</P>

<P>
Pets are pretty easy to use -- there are only a few commands they respond to, 
and you will use even fewer.  The commands are: /pet guard me - tell the pet to 
guard you - redundant, because the pet is <STRONG>always</STRONG> guarding you; 
/pet follow me - tell the pet to follow you; /pet sit down - has the pet sit 
down, causing it to regain HP faster; /pet stand up - has the pet stand up again 
after sitting down; /pet guard here - tells the pet to stay in one place, 
guarding;  /pet taunt - tells the pet to taunt what it's fighting (the default); 
/pet notaunt - tells the pet to not taunt the things it's fighting; /pet back 
off - tells the pet to stop fighting what it's currently fighting - note that if 
the MOB hits you or the pet, forget it, the pet is going to continue fighting; 
/pet attack - duh; /pet get lost - kills the pet.  Most Necromancers make a 
hotkey bank with the 6 most used pet commands -- these vary from player to 
player, over time you'll find out what works best for you. 
</P>

<P>
<EM>If you hand your pet a weapon (just like trading with a player), it will 
wield it.  Note that there is no way to get it back, so don't give it anything 
good.  Unlike players, the only thing weapons do for pets is possibly make them 
attack faster.  Each pet spell has a maximum damage the pet will do, regardless 
of weapon.  So the only reason to give it a weapon is to make it attack faster.  
A pet's fists attack at a speed of 30, so any weapon with a speed of 30 or 
better will help the pet, whereas a weapon with a speed over 30 will hurt the 
pet because it will make him attack slower.  Also note that later on, your pet 
will gain the ability to dual wield -- so giving him two weapons will be 
desirable.</EM>  
</P>

<P>
The above paragraph on giving weapons to pets has been left in for historical 
reasons.  It is now completely untrue.  The only reason to give a pet weapons 
is to get it to dual wield, as pets won't dual wield their fists; they need two 
weapons to DW.  Giving a pet a high damage weapon won't increase his damage -- 
each level of pet has a set max damage.  Giving a pet a fast weapon won't 
increase his speed -- each level of pet has a set speed.  Only your pet buffs 
and the haste spells of Enchanters and Shamen can increase your pet's attack 
speed.
</P>

<P>
From level 1 thru level 4, you basically are going to make sure your shielding 
spell is active, then pull a beast to you with a Lifetap or some other offensive 
spell, and then beat on the thing in melee along with your pet, and cast more 
Lifetaps here and there until the thing dies.  You are insanely weak at these 
levels.  Do not worry -- it's more than made up for by the power you will soon 
start to feel
</P>

<P>
Once you reach  level 4, you get Meditate, which will make your life a LOT 
easier, and more new spells.  Get the pet spell first again, and then Clinging 
Darkness, then the rest.  The level 4 pet is a <STRONG>huge</STRONG> upgrade and 
will serve you quite well.  Clinging Darkness is the first spell in the Darkness 
&quot;line&quot;, line being a term for a group of spells that you receive 
updates to throughout your career.  The Darkness line is a great group of spells 
because they reduce your target's movement speed, allowing you to get off more 
spells before they reach melee range.  The Darkness line also does Damage Over 
Time (DOT).
</P>

<P>
Typical level 4 strategy goes like this:  pull with Darkness, send pet, hit with 
poison bolt, maybe then drop a disease cloud and/or siphon strength, then help 
out the pet with melee or maybe a few lifetaps.  This is a pretty sound, easy, 
and safe kill strategy.  You'll probably use all your mana, but at these levels 
you don't have much so medding back up to full shouldn't be a big deal.  The 
medding time will also give your pet time to heal back to full.  Make sure you 
don't start a fight unless your pet is at full health -- you can check this at 
any time with /pet report health. 
</P>

<P>
If you get into trouble, you can also use your Fear spell to make the monster 
run away in fear.  This is not a permanent solution -- the spell will wear off 
and when it does the monster will come back, possibly bringing his friends to 
kill you.  So you'll need to either zone, or find a way to kill it when it comes 
back.  Still, Fear can save your life.
</P>

<P>
This type of strategy will continue pretty much up until level 12.  Level 8 
brings new spells again -- as always get your pet spell first, then the rest.  
There are a few things to note at level 8.  
</P>

<P>
The first is that you get Ward Undead. This will allow you to do (for the 
level) a high amount of damage to undead creatures.  It's not mana-light, it 
uses quite a bit of mana, but if you are fighting the undead you will be more 
efficient than most other classes because of this spell.
</P>

<P>
You also get Dark Pact, the first in a line of fairly unique spells.  What it 
does is trade some of your HP for Mana over a period of time.  It's not a 1:1 
trade, you get more Mana than you lose HP.  To some players, especially those 
who have experience with melee classes, this spell seems terrifying.  They can't 
understand why you would want to trade HP for Mana.  Well, it's quite simple -- 
you are a Caster, and Casters are NOT supposed to get hit much, if at all.  It 
is FAR more important that you have Mana, because as long as you have Mana you 
can cast spells and do damage.  Dark Pact is also great to cast right before you 
sit down to meditate as it will greatly reduce the time it takes to med up to 
full.
</P>

<P>
Finally, you get Dark Empathy.  This may not be useful to you at this level 
because you are likely exclusively soloing, but if you do want to help others, 
you can finally do so.  The spell transfers some of your HP to another 
character.  So, at the cost of your own health, you can heal others.  Just 
something to take note of.
</P>

<H4>Level 12</H4>

<P>
Level 12 brings another change in your power, and probably in your killing 
strategy.  You get the first in another line of DOT spells -- Heat Blood.  This 
is a VERY nice DOT, and you will be using it a lot.  Please note that it is 
heat-based and DOES NOT work in Lavastorm.  You also get an upgrade to the 
Darkness line, Engulfing Darkness.  Also of note you get Bind Affinity, so you 
can finally Bind yourself anywhere you like.
</P>

<P>
Another new spell type we see at this level [when I was level 12, this spell 
didn't exist] is Leach, the first in a line of spells that continues with 
Vampiric Curse and finally Bond of Death at 49.  It is like a Lifetap in that it 
transfers life from your target to yourself, but this line does it over time.  
This ends up being more efficient -- since you have to wait for the transfer, it 
gives you more than a same-level direct lifetap.  It also tends to cause less 
aggression from the MOB since he doesn't notice what's happening until it's too 
late. =)  Another good thing about this line is that you can drop the spell on a 
MOB one second before it dies and you STILL get the health over the duration of 
the spell, even after the MOB is dead.  This is great to lessen the health drain 
of Dark Pact.
</P>

<P>
You will probably want to change your tactics at this point.  You can continue 
killing Blue-con creatures and possibly some White/Blacks with your same tactic, 
but if you like, you can take on some much tougher beasts, including yellows and 
reds, but you have to change how you fight.  Your pet can no longer stay in 
melee with these beasts long enough for the MOB to die, so you'll have to make 
the creature not hit your pet.
</P>

<P>
The way to do this is with Fear.  What you do is this, find a yellow or JUST red 
beast (i.e., just barely red... not a spectre for instance), pull it with 
Darkness, send the pet, hit it with Heat Blood and then FEAR IT.  It will turn 
and run, the DOTs will be doing full damage because it's fleeing, and also the 
pet will be following it and beating on it.  If the Fear breaks, just re-fear 
it.  If the DOTs wear off before it's dead, just re-apply them or just use 
Lifedraws to finish it.  You need to use the Fear tactic to do this because MOBs 
of yellow/red con will kill your pet long before the DOTs kill it, and then it's 
coming for YOU.  For example, Kodiaks (ADULT kodiaks, not young kodiaks) con 
yellow and red (it varies) at 13 and 14.  They hit very hard (high 30s) and 
pretty fast.  They'll shred your pet pretty quick -- if you don't believe me try 
it. :)  But, I can solo them with this tactic at 13 and up.  
</P>

<P>
Save a small amount of Mana in case something goes wrong.  If your pet dies or 
you run way too low on Mana to finish the thing, just Shadowstep a few times to 
get far away from the MOB and then run for the zone.  You may still occasionally 
die but this will seriously cut down on it.  Shadowstep uses very little Mana 
and has a very short casting time, so it's great for putting quick distance 
between you and something that's beating you up bad.  The beast will still come 
for you, so you need to either run for the zone or gate.  Don't try to cast gate 
while in melee, it will never work.  Shadowstep 1-2 times first.
</P>

<H4>Level 16</H4>

<P>
As with all previous spell groups, the level 16 spells bring yet another huge 
jump in power.  As before, buy your pet spell (Restless Bones) first, and then 
the rest.  Most especially Heart Flutter.  Heart Flutter is a new DOT -- and it 
is a good one!  Not only does it do pretty decent damage, it also drops the 
target's Strength and AC as well.  It makes your pet and any other melee fighter 
much more effective, and makes them take less damage due to the MOB's reduced 
STR.
</P>

<P>
You also get a huge amount of new buffs, most of which are as always self-only.  
You get Shielding, an upgrade to your personal shield spells (starts at level 1 
with minor shielding -- you've gotten 2 or 3 upgrades to this series already, 
you should have been buying them all along).  This should be kept active on 
yourself at all times.  It adds Magic Resist, Hit Points, and AC.  Another new 
spell is Shieldskin -- this is a strange sort of spell that doesn't add to any 
stats, instead it adds a 100-point or so damage sink.  The first 100 points of 
damage you take while this spell is active simply sink into the shield; you take 
no damage.  It's expensive to cast, requiring a Cat's Eye Agate at 0.2.5.3 per 
stone, but it's well worth it.  And finally, you get Spirit Armor.  This is a 
<EM>targetable</EM> (believe it or not!) armor class (AC) buff that you can cast 
on anyone -- including your pet!  It adds 15 AC, which doesn't seem like much, 
but it's at least a little helpful.  And it's targetable. :)
</P>

<P>
Another spell you receive at this level, Feign Death, is quite controversial.  
What it does it allow you to &quot;play dead&quot;, hopefully tricking MOBs into 
thinking you're dead and hence leaving you alone.  Opinions on this spell's 
usefulness and safety are extremely varied, and I have yet to test it in the 
field, so I cannot comment on strategies for using it.  I'll update this once 
I've tested it, but for now, I am simply mentioning that Necromancers do in fact 
receive this spell at level 16. :)
</P>

<P>
Also of note is Cancel Magic.  This is a great spell, especially if you hunt in 
Lavastorm.  Tired of those &quot;YOU are burned!&quot; or &quot;Jabartik was 
burned.&quot; messages?  Those are from the fireshields that a lot of Lavastorm 
(and other zones as well, Lavastorm just seems to be really bad for this) MOBs 
have on them.  These shields can be taken down with Cancel Magic and then you 
will no longer get damaged each time you hit the MOB.  You may have to cast it 
2, sometimes even 3 times to remove the fireshield, but when you no longer get 
burned when you hit the MOB, you'll be very thankful you took down the shield.  
This spell can also remove buffs from MOBs, and you can even use it to remove 
harmful spells (such as DOTs) from yourself, your pet, and your group members.  
It doesn't work (on non-PvP servers) on anyone but MOBs, yourself, your pet, and 
those in your group.  This is to prevent jerks from running around taking buffs 
off people.  
</P>

<H4>Level 20</H4>

<P>
Ah, at last!  Level 20, the age of Norrathian majority, where you can choose 
your surname.  Choose it with pride, and use the /surname command to add it, or 
have a Senior Guide do it if it contains an accent mark. :)
</P>

<P>
This is another great level for Necromancers.  We get a new pet, as with all new 
spell circles.  This one is another great upgrade, it summons a powerful pet 
indeed.  You are of course /con'ing your pets and making sure they are the most 
powerful available, right?  Generally, at the level of the spell itself (i.e., 
level 20 for the level 20 summon spell), the strongest pet will /con with 
&quot;looks kind of dangerous&quot;.  Make sure you keep using /pet get lost and 
re-summoning until you get the powerful one or you could find yourself in a heap 
of trouble.
</P>

<P>
This level brings us another ability we share with all pure casting classes (and 
priest classes as well) - Specialization.  This allows us to specialize in a 
certain casting skill (Alteration, Abjuration, Evocation, Divination, 
Conjuration), thereby reducing mana usage, casting time, fizzle rate, and resist 
rate for spells of that type.  What you do is, at level 20, go to your guild and 
train ALL FIVE specialization skills.  Just put one point into each, this will 
make your skill 20 in all of them.  THEN, you cast a spell of the type you want 
to primarily specialize in until that Specialization skill is 51.  That sets 
your primary specialization.  DO NOT leave this to chance!  Mem a level 1 spell 
of the type you want to have your primary specialization in, and cast until you 
get 51 in that specialization.  Most Necromancers pick Alteration and this is 
the logical choice - our lifetaps, and most of our DOT spells use Alteration, so 
reducing mana usage, cast time, and resist/fizzle rate of these spells is a Good 
Thing(tm).
</P>

<P>
At level 20, we also finally get a new lifetap spell.  This is a nice upgrade, 
as we can now steal 65hp of life (at level 20) from our foes.  This is a good 
thing, because we also get Allure of Death, with trades 8 hp for 8 mana each 
tick for quite some time.  This, as with the lower power spell Dark Pact, is the 
true power of a Necromancer - converting life into mana and then stealing that 
life back from our foes.  No other class can do this and it is the secret of 
ultra-successful Necromancers.
</P>

<P>
If you like to hunt Undead, this is a great level also!  We get Expulse Undead, 
which does a large amount of damage to Undead - it's a great upgrade to our 
level 8 Ward Undead spell.  We also get Dominate Undead, which allows us to 
charm an undead monster for a period of time.  You can't have a summoned pet at 
the same time, but clearing out an Undead camp using one of the undead from the 
camp as your pet (especially when there's a bunch of zombies and a ghoul - charm 
the ghoul!) to kill the rest, then killing the pet when the charm wears off is 
great fun.  Be warned that the charm WILL wear off, and when it does, your 
former pet is going to be VERY MAD at you.  Be prepared to kill it quick.
</P>

<P>
If you are doing any grouping (some Necromancers never group, some always 
do...), at level 20 you get a pretty good spell to use in groups.  It's called 
Shadow Compact and it's a sort of reverse lifetap.  It transfers some of your HP 
to the target over a short period of time.  Your pet is a valid target also so 
it's not only a grouping spell; it can work great when soloing as well.  It 
transfers a little over 100 HP from you to the target over around 20 seconds.
</P>

<P>
Also of note is Shadow Vortex, which lowers the target's AC.  This is great, 
especially at these lower levels, as it allows your pet (and your melee class 
groupmates if you have them) to hit more often and for more damage.  Use it, 
love it. :)
<P>

<H4>Level 24</H4>

<P>
Ahhhh... What a true level of power this is for a Necromancer!  So many spells 
we receive at this level are truly powerful, it's very hard to explain how 
strong you will feel when you finally get this level!
</P>

<P>
You get an upgrade to your personal shield, Major Shielding, that gives a nice 
boost to your standard shielding.  Also, Leatherskin is now available, which is 
an upgrade to Shieldskin and will damage-sink around 200 damage -- a very nice 
benefit!  The spell requires a bloodstone and is well worth it.
</P>

<P>
Of course, as always, you receive a new pet spell (Haunting Corpse), though this 
time it is research only, so you will need to obtain the Words and create the 
spell via research, or purchase it from another player.  Mythiran Tower (<A 
HREF="http://mythiran.allakhazam.com/" TARGET="new">click here</A>) has all the 
research information.  Your pet at this level appears very dark, a nice visual 
upgrade.
</P>

<P>
Another research only spell, Intensify Death, is a pet-only buff that truly 
makes your pet a death machine!  It only lasts 5 minutes, so what you do is cast 
the spell on your pet right before a tough battle and then send him in to kill.  
You will really notice a difference in effectiveness using this spell.
</P>

<P>
Now we come to the true surprise of this level.  Shock of Poison.  Poison?  A 
Necromancer spell?  Must be another DOT, right?  Nope.  146 direct damage at 
level 24.  No waiting, 146 damage instantly.  Wow...  It's hard to describe how 
wonderful it is to finally have this spell!  Basically you will: buff pet, send 
pet, darkness, wait a while, then SOP SOP, dead.  Easy fights.  This spell is 
really effective at this level -- 146 damage is a lot at level 24, especially 
for Necromancers who are used to having to wait 60 seconds or more to see the 
full damage of their spells.  You will use this spell A LOT.
</P>

<P>
You also get a few utility spells at this level: Breath of the Dead, a self-only 
underwater breathing spell; Resist Cold, a cold resistance buff; Rest the Dead, 
an undead-only lull spell; and Screaming Terror, which is SUPPOSED to cause a 
stun effect/mesmerize effect, but I have yet to see it actually do ANYTHING on 
the MOBs I've tried it on.
</P>

<P>
All in all, level 24 is a true power level for the Necromancer.  Enjoy it!
</P>

<H4>Beyond</H4>

<P>
Whew!  It's been <EM>ages</EM> since I've updated this guide!  I last updated 
this guide shortly after I made 24, and now I've been at Level 44 for 3 days!  A 
lot of power is given Necromancers between 24 and 44 -- a new hp-to-mana 
conversion spell, upgrades to all major DOTs lines, 2 very fast acting and very 
high damage DOTs that stack, a new pet buff, a new Fear spell, the list goes on!  
We'll tackle them spell-level-by-spell-level. 
</P>

<H4>Level 29</H4>

<P>
As always, another big upgrade in power.  Most of your pets summoned with the 
Level 29 pet spell will dual wield -- make sure you have one that dual wields 
before fighting as the ones that don't will be too weak.  You also get a great 
number of other spells.
</P>

<P>
29 brings an upgrade in the Darkness line - Dooming Darkness.  I'm a rather 
controversial Necromancer in that even now at level 44 I use the highest level 
Darkness (this one - 49 is the next upgrade).  Most of our brethren say to use 
the lowest (L4 Clinging) or second-lowest (L12 Engulfing) due to high resists.  
Yes, Darkness gets resisted.  A lot.  But it's not that bad and using the higher 
level Darkness has it's benefits.  
</P>

<P>
Firstly, it lasts longer.  Darknesses are not  high-damage DOTs; most of us use 
them for the Snare effect so we can Fear-kite (and in dungeons, to prevent 
runners).  Clinging has a real short duration and Engulfing isn't a lot better.  
Dooming lasts a good long time.  Secondly, the higher level spells seem to slow 
the MOBs down more, which can be a really good thing. =)
</P>

<P>
So - I say use your judgement as to which Darkness to use. I use the higher 
level one, a lot of people don't.  Test it both ways and find out what works 
best for YOU.  Everyone's a little different.
</P>

<P>
We also get upgrades to the Heat Blood line (Boil Blood), the Leach/Vamp Curse 
line (Vampiric Curse - 150 or so HP from MOB to you over about a minute even if 
the MOB dies 1 second after casting), the pet heal line (Renew Bones), and the 
Undead DD line (Dismiss Undead).  To round the spells out, we get a DD-vs-Plant 
(*cough*useless*cough*) spell (Defoliate), a new lifetap (Spirit Tap, get it, 
use it, love it), and a point-blank AOE (read: suicide) spell (Word of Spirit).
</P>

<H4>Level 34</H4>

<P>
This is often considered a major level for us Necromancers.  You've made it to 
the mid-thirties.  You've made it past your first Hell Level and Post Hell Level 
(personally I hate the post-hell EXP loss MUCH more than the in-hell slow EXP 
gain).  Now you get Level 34 and you get some truly awesome spells!
</P>

<P>
The first I'll mention (I don't usually mention pets at these levels because you 
know by now you need the new pet) is Call of Bones.  This is an upgrade to the 
Allure of Death line.  It converts HP to mana at a pretty decent rate.  It's 
almost as good as Clarity (Enchanter spell).  It also turns you into a skeleton 
for the duration of the spell, making you non-KOS to some things while KOS to 
others (don't have COB on near Nektulos guards, for instance).  The spell lasts 
a good while and IT WILL KILL YOU if you don't pay attention to your health.  
What I like to do is cast a Vampiric Curse right before a MOB dies so I get the 
175 or so health while I post-fight Meditate.  You will use this spell a lot.
</P>

<P>
Another awesome spell is Venom of the Snake, a poison based 40 second DOT that 
does an initial 40 points of direct damage.  You may think that being only 40 
seconds long it doesn't do much damage.  Wrong.  It does around 540 damage in 
that 40 seconds making for a GREAT DOT!  Of course this is not without a price.  
Once the spell is 1/4 or 1/2 way through you can FORGET about anyone getting a 
MOB off you.  This spell makes them frenzy on you like mad.  Then again, you're 
probably fear-kiting at this level anyway so no worry. =)
</P>

<P>
Other must-haves are Greater Shielding (upgrade to personal AC/HP/MR spell), 
Steelskin (upgrade to damage-absorbing shield line, uses a Jasper [ouch!]), new 
undead Charm (Beguile Undead), Root (gee, thanks, other casters only got it at 
level 4!), and Invoke Fear (a really nice upgrade to good old Fear).
</P>

<P>
Enjoy the power!

<H4>Level 39</H4>

<P>
You've made it through Hell-2 and PostHell-2!  Congrats!  More new spells and 
yet again more power!  By now you probably have your spell effect graphics 
(Particle Density = low or off) turned off due to graphic draw lag during heavy 
fighting, but when you level to 39, turn it back on for a while. =)  You'll 
enjoy the treat when you cast. 
</P>

<P>
Augment Death is an upgrade to Intensify Death, the pet buffing line.  It adds 
HP, AC, and more importantly HASTE to your pet.  It makes it into a true killing 
machine.  Keep this on your pet at all times!  You'll notice a huge difference.
</P>

<P>
You thought VoTS was great at level 34?  Well it was, and at level 39 we get yet 
another spell that basically does the same thing.  540 damage over 40 seconds 
with 40 points of initial direct damage.  It's called Scourge, and it's disease 
based and STACKS WITH VENOM OF THE SNAKE!  I really don't think I need to 
elaborate.  Revel in your class choice. =)
</P>

<P>
We also get a new lifetap (Drain Spirit), a new disease cure (Counteract 
Disease), a new magic cancel (Nullify Magic), new vs. undead DD (Expel Undead), 
and an upgrade to the Scent line of resistance debuffs (Scent of Darkness).
</P>

At 39, you could also scribe and cast the spell Summon Corpse but acquiring the 
spell is a very long camp in the dungeon of Paw.  Additionally, the reagent you 
need to cast it costs a lot of cash (175pp or so), weighs 10, and can't be 
placed into any container.  As you can see, at 39, this is not a useful spell 
unless you have rich friends who don't know any higher level Necromancers.  Get 
it now if you want or need it, but most Necromancers wait quite some time -- I 
have a Level 54 friend who still doesn't have it.  
</P>

<H4>Level 44</H4>

<P>
Muahahaha...  Only one spell group between you and extreme power!  While I was 
going through 43, friends kept telling me how much I'd love finally being 44, 
and they were absolutely right!  The 44 spells are insane!
</P>

<P>
It's hard to decide which spell to talk about first.  So I'll start with the 
obvious - the new pet.  It hits for a lot of damage, is pretty fast (especially 
when you slap Augment Death on it), and it randomly procs a lifetap effect 
during fights.  This is one mean pet! Give him two weapons and let him go to 
town!
</P>

For a long time now, you've probably been enjoying the raw power of your DOTs.  
Maybe sometimes loading on all 6 lines and Fearing a MOB just to watch it keel 
over with nothing touching it -- just because you can (though doing so is a 
scary waste of mana).  But the whole time, deep down inside, there's been a 
gnawing, aching feeling...  Wizzy envy!  Sure you can do 540 damage over 40 
seconds with only one spell.  But Wizards can do it in 2 seconds with a single 
spell.  And keep doing it until the MOB frenzies on them and they die...  But 
still.  You wish you had some DD power -- Shock of Poison is pretty useless by 
44.  Enter Ignite Bones. 494 damage. Instantly.  BAM!  Sure Wizzies can do more 
at this level.  Sure Ingnite Bones isn't chain castable (you have to wait for 
the secondary effect of it to wear off - 18 seconds).  But still, it's a 
powerful spell and you're probably going to use it a lot.  It does 494 direct 
damage to any target that doesn't resist it (grrrrr) and turns that target into 
a skeleton for 18 seconds.  During that time their AC is severely reduced (some 
say it's dropped to 0 others say to 1).
</P>

<P>
A lot of people love DMF, or Dead Man Floating.  Well at 44 you'll finally be 
able to give them what they want!  Hell I entered Lower Guk the other night and 
instantly got 8 tells asking for it!  It's no wonder.  It has a lot of effects: 
Levitate, See Invisible, +60-70 or so to Poison Resist, Underwater Breathing, 
and Ultravision.  And it lasts a LONG and more importantly PREDICTABLE time.  No 
more having Levitate pop off when you need it most.  DMF always lasts for the 
same amount of time (long - I haven't measured it; it's around a game day or 
so).
</P>

<P>
You thought that Call of Bones and Shadow Compact was going to kill you someday 
when you weren't paying enough attention?  Well at 44 you get a new way to kill 
yourself in a scarily short period of time.  Pact of Shadow is an upgrade to 
Shadow Compact and transfers around 300 hp from you to the target over only 24 
seconds.  Ouch.  Note that you can heal your pet with this also.  Also be aware 
that you can have POS active on 2 or more targets.  Be doubly aware that until 
you get Bond of Death at 49, POSing 2 or more targets will probably kill you. =)  
Still it's a good way to heal a party member when needed, just so long as you 
can Lifetap and/or Vamp Curse your health back.
</P>

<P>
At 44, you also get upgrades to your personal shielding spell (Arch Shielding), 
the damage absorbing shield line (Diamondskin - uses Peridot (!!!) so only use 
it for super tough fights and stick to Steelskin for normal use), the Heart 
Flutter line (Asystole, a fairly high damage debuffing DOT), and the mana 
transfer line (Covetous Subversion).
</P>

<H4>What Lies Beyond...</H4>

<P>
I'm told that at 49 I will be a total death machine.  And doubly so because I 
always have a Rogue pet that doesn't go away when I zone. *grins* We shall see 
when I get there -- and I'm in a great guild with a bunch of great people now so 
I've no doubt it won't be long before I see 49!
</P>

<P>
Until then...
