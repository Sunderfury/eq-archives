</FONT><HR>I've been reading through the many posts and helpful links in this site, and I do have to say that it has been a most helpful and informative site. However, I must admit that I have one major point I feel I'd like to make.<P>It concerns role-playing.<P>I, for one, as a player, have always done things different than the norm, and have pretty much done so for 21 years. My characters have been, to say the least, unique. (Like the vampire in V:tM that was afraid of the dark... had to sleep with a night light in his coffin.) I have always stood by my personal right, as a RP'er, to play my characters however I wish to, regardless of racial tensions, class angst, social standing, and the like.<P>Thus was born Daveris, my Dark Elf ShadowKnight on The Rathe server. the personal history I have for her goes something like this: She was forced into SK training by a very cruel father. Humans killed her mother when she was still in her teens. She had the teachings of Innoruuk rammed down her throat since almost Day One.<P>However, instead of it sticking to her, she felt resentful towards both Innoruuk and her father.  She felt even more so when a captive human priest of Erollisi was brought in to be summarily executed. Curious, she asked him why. When she found out it was merely because he was a human, and a priest of Erollisi, she was horrified. Destroying both the Book of Discord and the Guild letter she was given, she left and hasn't been back since.<P>Since then, she has strove to try and be better than Innoruuk, better than her father, and better than most people that (in her mind) blindly hate everyone for what they are, who they follow, and who they associate with. She'll help anyone in need if she at all can.<P>Pretty lengthy? This is how much detail I put into my characters. And to think that was all off the cuff.<P>This is why I assert my personal right to RP however I want to: Where's the individuality in it if everyone follows the stereotype? Hell, on Tholuxae Paellis, I play a Human Cleric that was essentially shielded by no less than 3 Dark Elves. You're trying to tell me that the suggestions (and that's all that they are, suggestions) printed on this site should be taken as The Role-Players Guide to Dark Elves?<P>Somehow, I don't think so.<P>At any rate, I think I've rambled on for far too long about my character, and why I can, should, and will play them as individuals and not something that any blacksmith can make from a mold.<P>Thank you.<P>Daveris (Starshadow)<BR>12th level ShadowKnight<BR>Council of Sylvan Order, The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.240.93.129</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>  Sounds an awful lot like me.  Enchanters, according to most player guides out there, can never kill anything or complete quests that would cripple their movement inside the major cities.  I am a dark elf that has survived for 20 odd levels on the continent of Faydwer.  I have hunted and killed dark elven guards on occasion.  I am KOS to the prominent guilds in Neriak.  But do I regret ruining my standing with the more influential guilds?  Not at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.4.252.102</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

</FONT><HR>Daveris refuses to attack anything that shows her no hostility. For instance, the Dervishes in North Ro, she won't attack. They're still indifferent to her, and don't bother her when she comes walking by, so she doesn't attack them either. (Dorn B'Dyll, on the other hand, she's gonna kill him herself.) Scary thing is, she's working on gaining faction with, of all things, the Knights of Truth and the Priests of Marr! When she gets mre experienced, she's actually gonna help Cain Darkwood and the Priests of Marr in taking out the Freeport Militia!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.240.93.129</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>Well said.. all of you.. <P>I too, am a Shadowknight, but a Knight of the Shadow scorned because I do not follow to the dicipline of Innoruuk like many of our brothers and sisters of Neriak do... I am but a few of my race and dicipline who can walk freely around High Hold Pass and I am actually welcomed by those humans dwelling there ( I am amiable in HHold WHOOHOO~!) I am also in the process of improving my relations with the human cities of Qeynos and Freeport by dispatching their enemies--the Gnolls and the Orcs.  I, unlike many Knights of the Shadow that I meet, care how a city percieves me.. and take great pains to keep my relations with them in good standing.  I know that our kind is hated almost everywhere we go.. but I try to change what I can.. killing only monsters such as orcs, gnolls, and non-sentient creatures... making sure none are protected or cared for by a nearby realm... <P>Thankfully my mother, a powerful weilder of Necromancy.. and my father, a strong and imposing Knight of Innoruuk kept me from the strict schooling of Neriak.. opting to teach me at home, where they sheltered me from the restrictive ideals and the dark hatred that Neriak holds and continually teach their young..  They taught me to think freely.. not to judge others by their race or their choices, however different from my own... they taught me to love.. something that Innoruuk himself despises..  Since my parents death by the great dragon, Nagafen, I have been striving make my parents proud of all that I accomplish..  I was trained young by my father in his ways of the sword, and since my father's high standing in the Knighthood, I was given my father's place after his death.. despite my reluctance to embrace the ways of Innoruuk, he has still graced me with his strength and his power .. for this reason, I do not know..   an friend that I have met in my travels, an Erudite Wizard of high ranking, surmised that Innoruuk grants me my power so I will gain strength enough to eventually traverse the planes into his realm and confront him, so he may see how deep my hate is for him and his ways... and thus proving himself master over me, despite my resentment of him...  Whether this is true or now, I do not wish to think about it.. yet...  But I do know that I *will* confront him one day.. and then we shall see... <P>So fare you all well.. and feel not alone in your decisions to shun the darkness and walk in the light.. although we may be dark by birth... it does not mean that we have to continue to walk with our eyes closed...<P>Stay safe...<BR><P>------------------<BR>Krescent N'ytte<BR>Guild Leader of Empire of the Damned<BR>21st Rank Shadowknight<BR>Apprentice to Tenr O'Sevn<BR>Teir'Dal <BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 192.251.125.2</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>I, on the other hand, am the exact opposite of what you strive to be. I will slay a Dwarf for so much as looking at me the wrong way. I despise all other races, and have been known to even take out my aggression on our dark friends, the trolls and ogres. I believe that Dark Elves are superior to all other races and that our main goal should be to take total control of Norrath in the name of Innoruuk. I ask no quarter and give none as well. I am pretty much the Stereotypical Shadow Knight and you know what? I LOVE IT! It gives me a great joy inside to watch a foolish human ask me for help against a group of Orcs that has overwhelmed him, only to have me laugh at them, sit down and watch the fun, then kill the Orcs myself once they are dead. I am evil incarnate, and travel only with those who are the same, unless extreme situations arise. Bottom line, hope that you do not run into me someday, or I will have to end your life for betraying Innoruuk and his disciples.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.27.73.47</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

</FONT><HR>Well, it matters little, as that character was recently deleted. Over two months of work, gone. Why? It seems that we have a distinct LACK of Role-Players in this game. They only think in terms of kills and loot. In the 2 years I've played EverQuest, I can honestly say that the level of role-playing, while never high to begin with, has now all but vanished from the game. I've almost completely lost my enthusiasm for it. Where it used to be fun, now it's just another money-soaker. I honestly don't know if I can continue anymore.<P>Daveris Shadowstar<BR>Former 41st level ShadowKnight<BR>Tholuxe Paells server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.240.93.101</font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000038&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000038&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
