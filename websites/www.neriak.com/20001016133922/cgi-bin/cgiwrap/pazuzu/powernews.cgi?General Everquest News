The only item of public note is that the Ragebringer can no longer be equipped in the ranged slot.  A data entry error caused it to be initially allowed it to be equipped in that slot.<p>- The EverQuest Team

		September 28th, 7:00am<br>------------------------------<p>***Patch Day***<p>The following changes have been implemented on the production servers as part of today's patch:<p>*General Changes*<p>- NPC corpses level 55 or over will now last 30 minutes before decaying.  This should help those on large multi-group encounters who need some prep-time before looting items.<br>- The item "Woe" has been repaired.  If you receive the "Item out of charges" message when your "Woe" attempts to fire its spell, please contact a GM to trade out the item.<br>- The spell "Mark of Karn" has been changed.  The recast-time has been reduced significantly and the Hitpoint-return is now scaled inversely based upon the delay of the weapon.  In addition, a hitpoint return will only take place when the target is hit with a primary melee weapon, or the primary hand if you are unarmed.<br>- Some more tradeskill component vendors have been placed within the world to make certain tradeskills easier to use in your home town.<br>- "AFK" and "LD" status will now be reported above player's heads.<p>*Fleeing NPCs*<p>Last week's patch caused NPCs to flee more than before due to a bug that was fixed.  After evaluating the situation, we decided to reduce the chance to flee, but not to the extent that it was reduced before.  NPCs were previously much more "brave" than they should have been.<p>As part of the same change, charmed NPCs also began fleeing when low on health.  We've determined that this is not a good situation for the players.  As such, we have stopped charmed creatures from fleeing per player request.<p>*Level 1 Character Purge*<p>The Level 1 character purge has been completed.  All level 1 characters that have not been played within the past 30 days have been deleted.<p>*New Server Active*<p>Tholuxe Paells, a new server open to new characters only, is now active and ready for play.  Enjoy!  As a reminder, /movelog registration will take place on Mithaniel Marr and Tunare Friday evening from 6PM to Midnight (PDT: GMT-7).  Registered characters will be moved to a second new server, Drinal, early next week.<p>***User Interface Changes***<p>Many UI enhancements were made in today's patch:<p>*Moving and Resizing Windows*<p>The data windows in the full screen "HUD" mode may now be moved by clicking in the upper left-hand corner, moving them to where you want, then clicking again.  The "spell effect" and "chat" windows can be resized by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging to the appropriate size, and then clicking again.  Coordinates for window locations in each resolution are stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<p>*Bugs with Several Commands Fixed*<p>We fixed a problem with /book, /sit, and /doability that allowed them to be executed at inappropriate times, such as while charmed or feared.  They should now only function when the native button would have functioned if pressed.<p>*Miscellaneous Additions*<p>Added the following /-commands:<p>- /camp: Causes your character to camp out.  You must be sitting to use /camp.<br>- /disband: Will disband you from your current group, or turn down an invitation to join another group.<br>- /invite:  Will invite the target into a group, or accept an invitation if one is pending.<br>- /attack: Will toggle the state of "Auto-attack".  You may also add a parameter of "on" or "off" to explicitly set the state.<p>In addition:<p>- CTRL-1 through CTRL-8 will cast the spell in the specified spell-slot.<br>- ":" (colon: Short for /emote) and "'" (apostrophe: Short for /say) will now bring up the chat line in the same fashion as the /-key and ENTER.<br>- The "R" key (by default) takes you into reply-mode as always, bringing up a reply to the last person sending you a /tell.  However, you can now TAB and SHIFT-TAB to cycle through the last 10 people that have sent you /tells. <p>*Pauses in Socials*<p>You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).  <p>For example, a social consisting of:<p>/sit off<br>/cast 1<br>/pause 100<br>/sit on<p>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<p>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.<p>For example:<p>/sit off<br>/pause 100,/cast 1<br>/sit on<p>...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line.  <p>*Emote Codes*<p>The @ symbol has been replaced with a series of %-codes that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in ALL chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild). <p>The new %-codes are: <p>%T - Returns the current target.<br>%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).<br>%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).<br>%P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).<br>%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).<p>For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote:<p>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O.<p>...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it."<p>- The EverQuest Team<br>

		Hello all,<br>Last week while optimizing code, one of the programmers fixed a variable initilization problem that resulted in the fixing of a bug that had been around a long time in regards to when NPCs decide to flee. As a result of this, NPCs became much more likely to flee in combat. The response to this has been mixed, with roughly an equal number of people on both sides of the issue.<p>Now that the problem was fixed, we've reevaluated the the bravery code and determined that they flee too often now. As such, that potential to flee will be reduced in tomorrow's patch, though they will still flee more than they did before.<p>That said, the same change also had a decidedly negative effect: Charmed creatures began fleeing. I think everyone can agree that this part of it was pretty well objectionable, so we're going to stop charmed creatures from fleeing.<p>-Gordon<br>

		September 19th, 7:00am<br>------------------------<p>*Level 1 Character Purge*<p>The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7).  Any level 1 characters that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be deleted.  If you wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, please log in and play them between now and 9/27.  <p><br>***Patch Day***<p>As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more content for EverQuest players, today's patch primarily consists of *many* content-additions to the game.  <p>*New Epic Quests*<p>We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new "Fiery Avenger" style quests for every class in the game (including paladins).  The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model with unique particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.<p>Good luck to everyone on your quest.<p>*Class Issues*<p>Rangers:<p>Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills for all melee-centric classes.  In the course of these tests we determined that the ranger class was not performing to its intended level, and have made the following changes:<p>- The "Jolt" spell has had its casting time reduced.<br>- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.<p>Monks:<p>High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty.  The additional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.<p>Cleric:<p>Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are incompatible with that configuration.  We have therefore removed the cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell.<p>After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell's current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its "heal per hit" value decreased.  <p><br>*Fungal Regrowth*<p>"Fungal Regrowth" is now a self-only spell.  It was being used as an offensive spell by virtue of its "snare" effect upon the target.  Furthermore, we ruled out making it "group only" as with other spells that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern.  The spell was reducing the group's desire for classes capable of casting regenerative magic.<p><br>*Attack Speed Buffs*<p>In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any "Haste" item combined with any "Haste" spell to automatically yield maximum haste, regardless of the level of "Haste" granted by each individual component.  This fix increases the usefulness of better "Haste" equipment and spells.  The downside to this is that those who usually have both items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed unless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.<p><br>*High-Level Dungeon Balancing*<p>Veehshan's Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order to address disparities in risk and reward.  For the most part, the quality of the "common" loot in Veeshan's Peak is at least as good as the "rares" from Sebilis.<p><br>*Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*<p>In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay weapons can now only be equipped in the off-hand.  Included in this change are the Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip.  The delay on these weapons and the associated damage bonus to weapons in the primary hand made these weapons much too powerful for their availability and the risk associated with their acquisition.<p>In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus modified.  The damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or below) created a problem similar to the weapons above and has been reduced. The damage-bonus has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) two-handed weapons. The damage bonus for high-delay two-handed weapons (40+) has been increased.<p><br>*Server Selection Screen*<p>It has come to our attention that new players often think that the high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if everyone else is there, it must be a good server.  However, in Massively-Multiplayer games, less populated servers are often considered superior for gameplay.  Therefore we have marked servers that would benefit from new characters as preferred servers, listing them in "green" in the server selection window.  The preferred servers have populations such that an influx of new people would benefit the server rather than cause overpopulation.<p><br>*Custom Emotes and AFK*<p>Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Baobob", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" as the target. For instance: <p>/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it. <p>...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text output will be: "CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it." <p>Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK.  Type "/AFK <message>" (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK message.  For instance, if you type "/afk Grabbing a snack", you will reply with "Grabbing a snack" when someone sends you a /tell.<p><br>*Skill Gain*<p>The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by character stats.  This will allow those with natural affinities towards certain skills to improve at a greater rate.<p><br>*Trade Skills Enhanced*<p>Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, including dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging items, and other things to be discovered once in game.  <p>In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented.  Players will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available tradeskills. This includes: <p>- Baking<br>- Blacksmithing<br>- Brewing<br>- Jewelcraft<br>- Tailoring<br>- Fletching<br>- Pottery <p>Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to exceed 200.  Specialization restrictions do not include class or race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering.  Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally available trade skill. <p>The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project.  Further enhancements will be made in the coming weeks.<p>- The EverQuest Team<p>

		From the official everquest.com message boards:<p>>>>Please make the FBSS no drop.<br>We really don't like the idea of going around and making every desired item NODROP. Brad made a post a couple of days ago to that effect.<p>In any case, I doubt that it will be as valuable after tomorrow. We found a bug with the way "haste" items stack with "haste" spells. Basically, even the worst haste item combined with the worst haste spell would put the wearer at the haste cap. This basically invalidated the better haste items and spells, and explains why people have been saying that the newer haste items aren't any better than the FBSS.<p>This is being fixed in tomorrow's patch.<p>-Gordon<p><br>>>>Changing the way haste stacking works, at this point in the game's life will have a HUGE impact on class balance.<br>I disagree, fixing the bug pretty much affects everyone equally, and actually benefits people in many cases. I imagine that most were unaware of the bug and were buffing with maximum haste anyway. Now they can be secure in their spells meaning something. Not to mention, we can now look forward to the value of the different haste items being appropriate as well.<p>-Gordon<p>>>>I think it's bad that the entire game was balanced by playtesters who were all at the haste cap, a situation that is now no longer going to be common<p>You may have a point, but its not an absolute. Not everyone has both haste items and haste spells available, and those are the only ones who stand to be negatively affected by this change. Chances are, if you already have a high-level haste item, and have access to a haste spell as well, the cap is still very attainable. It just can't be done with the lowest level item haste and spell-haste available.<p>I am quite happy that we were finally able to track down the cause of everyone's complaints regarding one haste item being no better than another.<p>-Gordon<p><p>
