Any guild needs to have a few rules just to establish what is and isn't allowed, and to maintain some semblance of order and peace.  We've designed ours to be as simple to understand and to follow as possible.  They are:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>All out-loud &quot;says&quot; and /shouts need to be in roleplay.  If you need to communicate with someone who does roleplay, do it via the /ooc channel or via private tells.  If you absolutely must speak out loud in a non-roleplay manner (this should happen very rarely but it does happen), please do so in a mature, proper manner. &quot;Please allow our group to kill that MOB next time.  Let's rotate and be fair&quot; <STRONG><EM>NOT</EM></STRONG> &quot;u sux! we want 2 kill that next time, u need to wait 4 us...&quot;.  
<LI>We are creating a guild of friends here.  If you have a problem with another guildmember, please work it out with each other in private in a mature manner.  If the guildmasters need to get involved, something is wrong.  It would be better for the two parties to simply ignore each other rather than involve the rest of the guild and thus lessen morale.
<LI>Try to involve other guildmembers that are near your level in your hunts whenever possible.  Being in a guild allows us to form stronger groups, as we have the chance to group together time and time again, learning to work with and trust our guildmates.  This is one of the best things about a guild.
<LI>If you need to group with those outside the guild, as will often be the case, try to group with others of evil races first.  Group with light races as needed (there is no choice), but make sure they know who is boss. =) (And be sure they know it's all in good roleplay fun!).  Of course temper this rule with your knowledge of individual players.  For example, if you have a choice between a Dark Elf Cleric and a Halfling one, and you know the Halfling is the best cleric in the game and the Dark Elf one continually lets their groups die, <STRONG>please</STRONG> group with the Halfling!  This is a a game, please enjoy it.  Try to educate less-knowledgeable/skilled players in a polite way whenever possible, but please do not sacrifice hours of your work just because someone is a fellow Dark Elf.  You can justify it in roleplay by realizing that even a great race such as the Teir'dal has its idiots and misfits.
<LI>Use of any game bugs or cheats will not be allowed.  If you cheat, you are gone, no questions asked.
<LI>The /guildsay channel is for the enjoyment and use of the guildmembers as desired.  Roleplaying, OOC venting, idle chatter, all are fine and expected.  There are no rules for the guild channel except that you need to respect your fellow guildmates.  Barring that, anything goes.
<LI>Any decisions affecting the guild as a whole will be made via discussion with the entire guild.  All member's voices count equally.
<LI>Officers will be appointed as seen fit by the Guildmasters.  Long service, dedication to the guild and it's roleplaying tenets, and so on can go a long way toward getting someone noticed if that is their aim.  However, the officer position is really just to reward dedication to the guild.  There are no &quot;leaders&quot; per se, and in a game-mechanics sense, being an officer simply allows one to add someone to the guild, which needs done by the GM anyhow.  So, bottom line, don't constantly ask &quot;can I be an officer?&quot; ... Being one means little, and there will be very few.
<LI>As we are roleplaying Dark Elves who wish to gain favor with Mayong Mistmoore, <STRONG>DO NOT</STRONG> fight in Castle Mistmoore.  You can increase your MayongMistmoore faction by killing the numerous mail-quest bard NPCs all over.  This lowers faction with the North Freeport guards, Qeynos guards, and the bard guild.  It doesn't affect any other factions.  You can correct the faction hits later via several quests, just do not do it by fighting in Mistmoore.  Keep in mind that most Dark Elf guilds have you killing all manner of guards, and you end up KOS everywhere.  This is a very small and limited faction problem.
