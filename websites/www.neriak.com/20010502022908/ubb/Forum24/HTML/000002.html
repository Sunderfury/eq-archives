</FONT><HR>With all the message boards out there, and with people loudly complaining about this or that in various games, you'd think gaming companies would be able to use this to create the "perfect" game.  Or can they...<P>What is the "perfect" game?  The answers are as many as there are gamers...  For some, fully open PVP is a requirement; for others, NO PVP can be allowed.  Some want no penalties of any kind for anything; others want PERMANENT DEATH.<P>I'm sort of a centrist.  <P>I want PVP to be a possibility.  It makes sense in a roleplaying game.  How can you play an arrogant wizard who loves his mother if you can't bar-b-que the guy who calls his mother a whore?  How can you be a brave Dwarven Paladin serving his God with fervor if you can't slay the Dark Elven scum on sight?  But, some people don't want any PVP at all.  And, newbies have to be protected for jerks who would kill them, gaining nothing, just to piss them off.<P>What about consequences in the game?  <P>Everquest currently has the harshest.  You lose Experience Points when you die, and at higher levels, it can take hours or even days to gain back the lost EXP.  UO and AC have relatively little consequence.  <P>In UO, if you play in Felucca (the PVP+ facet), if you die, you're probably going to lose all your items, and 15 minutes or so of time.  Who cares?  Equipement is plentiful and cheap.  If you play on the Trammel facet there ARE NO CONSEQUENCES TO DYING.  You will not lose your items unless you are VERY SLOW in getting back to your corpse.  <P>Asheron's Call has the Vitae Penalty, where you lose a percentage of your stats (and hence skills) until you gain back "X" amount of EXP.  But that EXP also counts towards getting to your next level so honestly, there are no consequences to dying in any real sense. Unless you play on Darktide of course.  (PK Server).<P>So, we come to the buzz-term "Risk vs Reward".  Is it important?  These are GAMES after all. We pay to play and we want to have fun.  Why not just give us all we want?  Well, if we get all we want with no work and no risk, there is no sense of challenge or accomplishment and hence we will leave the games quickly.  So why bother?<P>Yes, it sucks to lose something in a game.  I got to Level 30 in Everquest and lost it once.  It took a while to get it back, and it HURT to lose it.  But, when I got it back, I felt really good - like I'd beaten the enemy and got my level.  Getting (insert uber-item here) can be risky - you might lose hours or days worth of EXP and have some really nasty corpse retrieval problems - BUT - when you get that item, you're going to feel like you earned it and you're going to love it.<P>So, yes, the "Risk vs Reward" has to be there IMO.  Otherwise there's no true sense of adventure, danger, or accomplishment.  Boredom would set in.<P>Another topic that would need handled for the "perfect" game is that of quests.  Hoenstly no game has decent quests currently.  <P>Everquest may have the most but they are static and don't make a lot of sense from a roleplaying standpoint.  Kill this guy for a cool thing.  He's DEAD I already KILLED HIM, how can 8747856756 other people assassinate him too?  Bah!  The "take this here for a reward" type quests should be in a game, and are great especially to get newbies started.<P>UO has no quests except GM or Seer run quests which are usually lag and death fests.<P>I don't know anything about quests in AC.<P>The ideal game would have "newbie quests" - usually of the "find this and take it to that" variety.  But it would also have dynamic quests that always change and are very engaging.<P>Such quests would obviously need to be human run.  UO's Seer program was supposed to make this happen in UO but it failed.  Shadowbane is trying again with its "Feature Character" program and it looks like they might succeed.  Let's hope they do.<P>Other things that would need nailed down include magic systems, combat systems, monster types, equipment, and so on.<P>So what's my perfect game?  Well, imagine the PVP possibilities of Day 1 UO (open PVP at any time, anywhere), but with sensible newbie protection put in, and with real consequences (but not ones that RUIN the character, except maybe in really extreme cases [500 murder counts in one day?]), mixed with the graphic richness of Everquest (say what you want - look at Neriak, Paineel, Everfrost, etc, on a REAL graphics setup - they're BEAUTIFUL), the racial choices of Everquest, with perhaps more thrown in, the wide variety of equipment in Everquest, and many magic systems along the lines of AC's magic system, and you're getting close... =)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 4.3.52.142</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>I think one important part of online gaming that is thought of, but not directly, is the sense of community.<P>In the time that I played Asheron's Call, I didn't see any banding together or sense of community like I saw in UO or EQ.  There was some, and it was probably much different if you swore fealty early in the game, but pretty much the bonding that most newbies to EQ feel was absent.<P>I think this makes a difference.  Your first few experiences and the people you have them with ingame can last through the levels and through character changes.  <P>EQ has done a lot to encourage this.  Especially with the controversial *NEED* for most classes to fight in a group.<P>So, I think that's the most important aspect of any multi player online game to me - does it encourage a sense of community and a sense of really caring about your character beyond what their paperdoll looks like in X armor.  If it meets that criteria, I'd say it's not only successful, but something that would be a joy to be a part of.<P>Zariu Qu`el`velguk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.78.66.223</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

</FONT><HR>Okay first off I could take just 10 people and ask each one of them what made a "perfect" game and end up with 10 different answers.  In fact, I'd be pretty sure I'd get 10 different answers.  I spent about 8 years in the MUD community writing mud code and doing other things (imming and stuff.)  Watched what kind of things people do in MORPG's and what enticed people into playing.<P>Personally I like PK environments but I don't like pk of newbies and I don't like the obvious mismatches created by a truly free PK environment.  That said I'd rather have it coded for a complete free pk environment with player enforced rules (yeah I know.)  The real problem with games like eq/uo/ac etc as it relates to PK are more than just game balance.  The real problem is there's at least a sizeable population out there who seems to only get their enjoyment from making other people unhappy in these games (just look at the naked mage ganker types on Rallos Zek.)  Honestly I wish those sorts of people (and yeah UO had alot of em too) would just go play quake or diablo or something.  On a mud this wasn't as much of an issue as it is with a pay for play game on a larger scale since we simply decided if somebody was to antisocial to allow to stay there they'd get banned permanently no if's and's or but's about it.<P>As for pk designs and game balance.  The ONLY way to get good effective balance out of it is to balance the classes for PK FIRST and FOREMOST, then go back and adjust the PVE difficulty levels to whatever kind of balance you want.<P>I personally like the sort of enforced grouping stuff for at least larger encounters.  I'm not sure how much I like the forced 30+ people for large large events.  My more favorite playtimes have all been with a single group or maybe 2 groups max (6 to 12 people tooling around.)  The way communication works in eq 12 is a pain unless you're a big enough pile of people you can just coopt ooc or some other channel for yourselves (re: 30+ people events.)<P>Also people want different levels of roleplaying (or lack thereof) although I honestly feel the game environment either caters to it or ignores it or gives it lip service.  EQ and UO basically pay lip service to roleplaying and there isn't much in the game mechanics that help it along.  <P>Global channels remove alot of the rp atmosphere as do things like /who all and /tell(msg) etc... That said on a massive game at least a portion of that is necessary or players will simply use outside tools to get together (icq etc.)<P>Anyway the perfect game may happen for you or me but probably not for both (although who knows.)  There's alot of things I did in my mud code and I'd love to get a chance to do game mechanics for a large MMORPG instead of a small mud but so far that hasn't happened either.<P>Anyway <P>Whirled Peas<P>Celegrom Alucinan<BR>Miaowara Tomokato<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 12.77.94.90</font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum24&number=24&thisthread=000002&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum24&number=24&thisthread=000002&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
