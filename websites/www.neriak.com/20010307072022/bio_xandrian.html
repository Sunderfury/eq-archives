The sun sparkled off the small creek as the wind rustled in the ferns. Xandrian smiled at his mother as she sat near him. &quot;Mother dear, this must be one of the best days of my life!&quot; he proclaimed.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Ahhhh my son, yes tis quite the glorious day. You father should be along soon with the food for our picnic. Faydark sees less and less days like this, we should enjoy them as much as possible.&quot; His mother replied as she laid out a large blanket to place the food upon when her husband Raenlyn returned.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Mother, will father teach me the ways of Faydark's Champions soon?&quot; Xandrian questioned. He had always wanted to learn the ways of the wonderful Rangers his father worked and belonged with.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Well, you should ask him, here he comes.&quot; She pointed behind them to his father's familiar form wandering toward them both and beginning to run to him.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Mother, wait I need to finish setting this blanket up.&quot; As he turned to look at his mother running blissfully toward his father his eyes seemed to light upon the rose she had dropped upon the ground. Out of the corner of his eye he caught his mother suddenly turning.
</P>

<P>
&quot;NOOOOOOOOO! Run Xandrian run!!!&quot;
</P>

<P>
Quickly glancing up he saw that while it was his father's form, his life had been drained from it. He could see spots of bone showing through the skin of his fathers normally robust form.  The skeleton had managed to lodge one of it's foul fingers in his mothers long golden hair as she turned to run back to him.  Suddenly from all around in the grass he could see more skeletons rising, each one more decayed and putrid than the next.  He had no choice but to run from the foul creatures. Making it to a corpse of trees he was able to turn back and watch as the dead beasts slaughtered his mother. He knew he would never hear her beautiful voice again and his eyes lighted upon the skeletal form of his father.

<P>
That scene played over and over in his mind as he wandered the forests around the tree city of Kelethin for weeks. Those undieing creatures destroying all that was dear to him. His Hate grew with every passing day. Hate for the undead, Hate for his fellow elves. For they had not come to help even though they were not far from the city. For they had always looked for a peaceful solution to the problems of the world, rather to talk about a problem then do anything about it. Else their patrols would have found this pack of undead and destroyed them. For the fact that they guarded their secrets to becoming a ranger, for had Xandrian been trained maybe he would have been able to help his parents.  But mostly within him grew a Hate for himself.  He should have stayed, maybe he could have helped (even though his father, a famed ranger had been able to do nothing), he should have run for help, he should have done SOMETHING.  
</P>

<P>
At last Xandiran came to a conclusion, he would go back to that place and try and find the skeletons, he would try and do something, even if he died trying.  It was no trouble to find the spot, it would forever be etched into his mind in the nearby Butcherblok mountains. He could still see bits of bone hidden in the grass, betraying the position of the skeletons. He walked toward the piles of bones with a stick, ready to smash these skeletons into bone chips.  He watched fascinatedly as the bones flew together and knit into a single huge skeleton.  It's burning red eyes searing into his soul. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Xandrian, I have waited for you.&quot; It rasped.
</P>

<P>
&quot;How do you know me foul beast.&quot; In truth, he was quite suprised by the speach of the undead and his desire for death was strangely diminished. &quot;What do you want of me?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;It is not what I want of you Xandrian, it is what you want of me. I can sense your hatred Xandrian, it is such a great force it is no wonder others cannot sense it as well.&quot; The stench of the rotting bones was so great that he wanted to pass out, but Xandrian stood his ground, memerized by the creature. &quot;You want the power to destroy these undead, you want the power to not be helpless. This I offer to you; and more! I am Innoruuk, God of Hate and I offer you the chance to destroy all who oppose you, I offer you a purpose!&quot;
</P>

<P>
At the proclimation of the creatures identity Xandrian hit his knees, he knew of the god, all Feir'dal knew of him as the father of their dark cousins the Teir'dal. He knew he should be afraid and repulsed, but he could not be.  The weeks spent dwelling in the forests thinking purely of Hate had opened his eyes. &quot;Dark Lord, I would accept your offer. I want the power to destroy those in my way, I want the power to accomplish everything I have dreamed of. I want the power to KILL these weak pathetic Feir'dal!&quot;
</P>

<P>
If a skeleton could be said to grin, this one did now. &quot;Ahh my son, you truely know the power of Hate. There is a price for this power, will you accept?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Yes my lord, yessssssssss.&quot; The word came out in a hiss of pain as his skin seemed to burn and crawl. Looking down Xandrian saw his pale skin begin to darken, from his bare feet to the holes in his ragged pants he watched the darkness climb. As the darkness climbed up to his head the pain grew too intense and he blacked out, but Innoruuk would not let it end like that, he had one last message.
</P>

<P>
&quot;The Heartstone will give you the power you want........find House Zexus.&quot;
