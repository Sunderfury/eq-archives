		I'd like to talk about a Class we all love - Clerics.<p>They can increase our hit points, heal us, stun monsters for us, resurrect us when we've died -- and can make food and drink when we're hungry and thirsty.  <p>But, on the downside - they have (self-described) "terrible" quests for armor and have to buy good armor, their spells and any mana and wisdom enhancing jewelry/weapons. Many of the Clerical-capable races that don't start out with as much strength naturally are always battling carrying capacity for armor vs. armor class issues.  This in contrast to the other "non Clerical" classes that just usually have to worry about two out of those three.<p>When talking to a 50th season cleric this weekend, he told us that he payed over 1000 platinum for *reagents* for plane raids.  This is *per week*.<p>When I said "Why don't they just all bring their own peridot, etc if they want that particiular spell put upon them?" all he answered was "I wish everyone felt that way!".<p>Now, for a shaman to put Spirit of the Wolf on you costs them nothing but time and mana. Most respectful people donate from 1-5 platinum per person for this (depending on their level and generousity).  But when a Cleric casts a symbol, they lose real platinum.<p>You may argue that at higher levels platinum means nothing.  But that 1000 platinum must come from somewhere.  And usually 2000pp-3000pp can loosen the 'trade only' restriction for items.<p>I have this simple proposal - if you are a melee class, or a class that wants a symbol put upon you, carry a few of the stones of the current Symbol of the clerics you'll probably be grouping with.  You don't need many unless you will be far from town for an extended period.  Just 5 of the current Symbol stone or, if you would prefer a lesser buff maybe 3 of the lower Symbol stone.<p>This will take strain from their bankaccounts, and you will have made a cleric (read: Master of life, death, and resurrections!) probably much happier. =)<p>The list of reagent-symbol-season is as follows:<p><br>Cats Eye Agate - Symbol of Transal - season 14<br>Bloodstone - Symbol of Ryltan - season 24<br>Jasper - Symbol of Pinzarn - season 34<br>Peridot - Symbol of Naltron - season 44<p><br>I'd also like to add that if you consistently would like things like Levitate or Underwater breathing (or some variant that is spell component related) you may want to keep some Bat Wings and Fish Scales handy.  This will take the strain off of our other casting classes and keep them from needing to auction for them, or kill endless streams of easy creatures to get them themselves.<p>Be good to your healers and casters, and they'll be good to you!<p><br>Zariu Qu`el`velguk<br>-23rd season Assassin

		I'm here to talk about the classes available to us as Dark Elves, and why they are not enough.  <p>We get some pretty good classes:  Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, SK, Wizard, Necro, Enchanter, Magician.  Not bad.  But, if we want to roleplay (and we do, RIGHT? :)) then we will only associate with other Dark Elves.  And this leaves out a lot of class choices, and leaves a lot of skills and spells unavailable to our groups - LEAVING US AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN COMPARED TO LIGHT-RACE GROUPS!<p>The first glaring omission IMO is the Ranger.  They have Tracking, a wonderful skill, and one that Verant is making more and more needed - for example, for finding rare spawns for quest items.  But we as Dark Elves don't have access to tracking, putting those of us who roleplay at an extreme disadvantage.  Doesn't Verant want to encourage roleplaying?  If so, they need to let us make DE rangers. <p>There's nothing inherently good about what Rangers do.  They are basically a lower-end Warrior that gets their skills late in life and has caps on the combat skills that Warriors don't have.  But they get Tracking.  And Foraging, another thing that's needed if one wants to practice the Brewing skill.  There's nothing inherently "good" about finding things to kill... So why is it that only good races can be Rangers?  Doesn't make sense... <STRONG>There were always Dark Rangers in AD&D</STRONG>... Why not in EQ?  FIX IT!!! :)<p>Druids are also missing... Why?  Nothing inherently good about their spells either. Using the power of nature to hurt and destroy.  Why can't DEs be Druids?<p>Monks?  A Martial artist?  Why wouldn't a Teir'dal want to hone his or her body into a perfect killing machine - so perfect that he/she doesn't even need weapons and armor to cause mass destruction?  I think Dark Elves WOULD want to do this... But only Humans can be Monks?  BAH!  <p>Then we come to Bards... Dark Elves don't make music?  They don't use it to weave magic to help their brothers/sisters and to harm the enemy? Puuuh-leeze!  Why can't we be Bards?<p>Anyway, I'll cut it short... You see my point.  If one is a roleplaying Dark Elf, they are put at a huge disadvantage by the race/class restrictions, and there's no good reason to have those restrictions in place.  AT LEAST Verant should let us be Rangers.  If you agree with this, PLEASE /feeback and /petition ingame AS MUCH AS YOU CAN and maybe we ROLEPLAYERS will get heard!<br>

		[This was sent in by Atos of Darkmoon (Xegony)]<p><EM><br>     My name is Atos En'Nim, you can call me ATOS. For over a RL year now i've traveled Norrath as an evil Teir'dal. I've always been ATOS, I know nothing else but the life of evil and i'd have it no other way. The pleasures of the darkness tickle my senses. Laughing at a human as he dies at my feet after asking for help is one of my greastest joys. Listening to the screams of young hunters die because my family and I have slain all the local guards gives me goose bumps. Telling light races that they are not worthy of my father Innoruuk's powerful blessings that I can cast, feeds my black heart. <p>     For in doing all this, those creatures become filled with hatred towards me and that is the first step to their destruction. They are now consumed and blinded by that force that rules the world and commands my existance, Hate. This is why we were created and denying your heritage is a fool's choice. Feel the hatred, move into an area and slay all living beings while shouting battle crys of evil. Once you become bloody and battered from a fierce battle againest the light you will never again stray from the thrill of the darkness.<p>     Living evil is a difficult task but strengthens your resolve for survival. I don't want to be able to visit any of those filthy slums that humans call cities. It's much more enjoyable to lay seige to those pits of greed killing every being in my path. Just another dungeon adventure as far as I'm concerned. Yes, all of them are going to die and I'm making sure it's soon. The commonlands have already been returned to Teir'dal posession. Sewer invasions and front gate raids on Freeport occur often. Only a matter of time before the city falls and is set ablaze.<p>     Traveling the wilderness is harse with very few allies on the path of adventure. We're stronger in will and can last longer out on our travels. So we only need those goodies for one thing, to prey on for pleasure as we torture, maime, then kill them. Come along with me and be part of what makes Norrath a killing playground of mayhem, the Teir'dal.<p>- Atos En'Nim<br></EM>
