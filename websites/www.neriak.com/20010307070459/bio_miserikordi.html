<P>
 Like the darkness that flooded the hearts of the Teir'Dal, night fell eternal on Miserikordi's eyes.  Since the moment when she first entered the world, her sight was nonexistant.  Over the course of her childhood, many began to fear her affliction was a sign her house had been cursed.  Puzzled clerics and other religious scholars shook their heads collectively as rituals promoting her healing were apparently ignored by Innoruuk.  Neighbors shunned all contact with the little girl, and gave her parents a burning glance for allowing her to play in the street with other children.  Miserikordi was doomed to a life of solitude.
</P>
  
<P>
With fading hopes for their firstborn, her parents took her to the Foreign Quarter.  There, other races with other deities lived in relative peace with the Teir'Dal.  They were directed by an Ogre standing watch to the house at the end of the way, where a Troll diviner resided.  Rumor among the locals had it she spoke for the gods, and could perform rites that cured the sick and raised the dead.  Surely, a blind waif would offer no challenge for her.
</P>

<P>
Inside the ramshackle structure littered with bones and perfumed with inscense, her parents knelt to the shaman respectfully.  The Troll stood twice as high as either of them; her costume of feathers and skull headdress made her a ghastly apparition in the light of the fire.  After hearing the story of Miserikordi's birth, the Troll roared with laughter.  In a singsong voice, much too articulate for Troll tongue, she spoke to the stunned parents:
</P>

<P>
&quot;No heart be pure among your kin, and thus no one may speak for me.  No other might purge them from within.  No healing for your daughter be.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Miserikordi found herself groping about on the street, wailing for her parents to return and lead her home.  Both parents turned at the end of the street, sadly regarding their little girl for one last time before fading into the shadows. 
</P>

<P>
A giant hand fell softly on her shoulder, and a kindly voice spoke, &quot;Dun worry none. Mama Smasha take good care of yous.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Why did they leave?&quot; Miserikordi sniffled, running a hand shakily over the one on her shoulder.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Dey dun understand yous,&quot; the shaman answered.  &quot;Yousa be de best ting to happen to dem in long time.  To de whole race!&quot;
</P>


<P>
Slowly, Miserikordi was led back inside the shaman's house, the inscense filling her nose.  The fire flickered orange and red on her eyelids.  &quot;Why am I here?&quot; she cried, putting both hands on the wall, trying to find a route of escape.  &quot;What good would a blind girl be to you?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Yous be speshul,&quot; Smasha laughed.  &quot;Isa teaching yous de way of de spirits, so yous can help your peeple!&quot;
</P>

<P>
She paused, hands and voice trembling.  &quot;Help them what?&quot; she asked quietly, not really caring to hear the answer.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Help dem to be great once again!&quot; Smasha bellowed. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Tank de gods Smasha be findin de girl!&quot;
</P>

<P>
As time passed slowly, Miserikordi grew to be a fair young woman with an otherworldly grace about her.  She moved through space using both sound and touch, all her other senses having filled the void left by her sight.  When she was old enough to learn, Smasha sent her to the enchanter's guild.  
</P>

<P>
Miserikordi was a bright student, and stood out among her classmates for other reasons than being sightless.  She was an adept, a prodigy.  For whatever reasons, she could channel magicks far stronger than others her age and experience.  At first, when the obligatory new-girl rumors began flying, she was made fun of because she was not only a bastard child, but living in a hovel with a Troll.  She took all the derogatory remarks in stride, and eventually became a less than promising target.  Over time, her classmates accepted her as perfectly normal, and all but forgot that when she turned to face a speaker, she wasn't really looking into their eyes.  
</P>

<P>
One day in a class session on religions, the teacher had invited a priest of some standing within the Order to speak on what influences ones powers, and ultimately, steers their destiny.  As Teir'Dal, the priest claimed, the great Prince that spawned them all drove the wheels of fate.  He controlled everything, from birth to death, in one way or another.  
</P>

<P>
From the back of the room, Miserikordi felt a chill through her bones.  Standing to her feet, Miserikordi cleared her throat politely. &quot;Sir?&quot; she ventured.  &quot;May I ask you something?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Certainly,&quot; the priest answered, almost cheerfully.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Assuming Innoruuk has had a hand in every matter so far, why aren't his children in a higher place than this?  Why do we Teir'Dal suffer at the hands of so many others that hate us?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Well, it is the will of Innoruuk that we hide in shadow until those that would destroy us lower their guard, to bring glory to him.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Was it also his will that I was made blind?  Will my suffering bring him glory?&quot;  The teacher's mouth fell open, and she could hear his shortened breathing.  
</P>

<P>
It was her complete sincerity and lack of bitterness that made the priest falter over his words.  &quot;Of c-course,&quot; he said, &quot;our master t-thrives on suffering.  Any one of his children know that.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Her eyes went to his, and made both teacher and priest shiver.  &quot;Then, perhaps, I am not his child,&quot; she said solemnly.  &quot;Thank you for answering my questions, sir.&quot;
</P>

<P>
When class was dismissed for the day, Miserikordi walked towards her home, keeping one hand lightly on the city wall.       
</P>

<P>
There were several thumps though someone were running, and then someone touched her arm.  &quot;Miseri, did you really mean that?&quot; a male voice asked.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Mean what, Almasy?&quot; she asked, eyes on the road ahead.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Not being a child of Innoruuk.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I don't know why I was made this way, or if I was made by anything,&quot; she answered, her voice wistful.  &quot;I have to find out for myself, I suppose.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;What? I don't understand,&quot; Almasy said, his brow furrowed.  &quot;What are you talking about?  Leaving?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Yes, leaving.  Perhaps for good.  No one around here really likes me, anyways.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I do,&quot; he said slowly.  &quot;I'm rather offended that you don't think more of
yourself, Miseri.  I think very highly of you.&quot;
</P>

<P>
With a rueful smile, her eyes met his.  &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said.  &quot;I think you're the only person other than Smasha that's actually tried to understand me.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;And I'll continue to try and understand you,&quot; he insisted, taking her free hand in both of his.  &quot;Please don't leave.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I'm afraid it's out of my hands.  Whatever is driving me has decided my path, now.  I must leave soon.&quot;  She let out a breath of air, her hand falling over the rough-hewn wooden door with the smooth, familiar handle carved from bone.  &quot;But, before I do, would you care to join me for dinner?  Smasha had some bixie parts in the storage room she didn't know about before, and wanted to treat me.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I guess my father wouldn't mind me being late,&quot; he said finally.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Whosa be your friend, Mizzi?&quot; Smasha rumbled as she spooned out stew into a bowl. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;This is Almasy, one of my classmates,&quot; she said, moving along from the wall to a large oak chair.  &quot;I brought him along for dinner.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Ahh, Basha ken see yous be a nice boy.  Isa glad Mizzi be gittin nice friends.&quot;  The Troll beamed a crooked smile at Almasy, and chuckled when he smiled back, uncertainly.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Smasha,&quot; Miserikordi began, taking her bowl from the Troll's hands, &quot;I've been thinking of going outside the city.  Just for a few days.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The Troll looked at her surrogate daughter, incredulous.  &quot;Whatsa matter, Mizzi?  Yous not lookin like yousself...&quot;
</P>

<P>
Miserikordi laughed.  &quot;I need to know who I really am.  Why I'm here.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Yous be here to eat dinner wit Basha,&quot; Basha said, jokingly, handing Almasy his stew.  &quot;Now, all dis talk bout yous not knowin who yous be, Mizzi--dat's silly.  Even Troll know dat you make yousself what yous are, no gods a gunna make yous a person.&quot;  
</P>

<P>
Almasy and Miserikordi ate their dinner slowly, listening attentively to the hulking Troll. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;If yous need ta go outside an find yousself, den dere be nothin I ken say bout it.  Isa jes want yous ta know Basha be proud of yous.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Miserikordi stared back at Basha, smiling.  &quot;I wished for the longest time that I could have heard my parents say they were proud of me, too, but now...thanks, Basha.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The Troll reached over the low table and took Miserikordi into a bear hug.  &quot;Isa gunna miss yous.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Me, too,&quot; she said.
</P>

<P>
As Basha put Miserikordi down, Almasy jumped to his feet, frowning.  &quot;Damn!  I forgot I was supposed to help with the store tonight,&quot; he said quickly.  &quot;My father will have my head for this!&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Miserikordi said, listening to the creaking of the door and turning towards it.  &quot;I hope you're still in one piece when I get back.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Oh, I will be,&quot; he said.  &quot;I'm just not sure if I'll be able to walk or not, heh heh.  Thanks for the short dinner, Miss Basha.  Goodbye, Miseri.&quot;  
</P>

<P>
After a pause, the door slammed shut.  Miserikordi turned to face Basha again.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;I'd better get to packing,&quot; she said quietly.  
</P>

<P>
That night, when all the torches hung in their brackets smouldering, Miserikordi peered into the street through a crack in the door.  With a small bundle of food in one arm, she slipped through the door and into the alley beside the house.  Suddenly, she realized she couldn't readily tell where she was going.  With no one else out at that hour making noises, she had to find other means of moving about safely.  She reached down to the ground and scooped up a handful of gravel.  By tossing pebbles in front of her, she could tell where walls and other obstacles were.  
</P>

<P>
One pebble was thrown, and did not return a sound.  She paused.  There was water running, off to the left of her, and a slight echo of it's fall.  A waterfall.  She nodded to herself, recognizing the area from the one time Basha took her up to the forest outside Neriak.  Unfortunately, she couldn't remember how Basha had gone around the small pool, and listening was rendered useless by the waterfall.  Miserikordi threw herself against the nearest wall, shuffling against it on her back.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Need any help?&quot; a friendly voice asked.
</P>

<P>
She grinned.  &quot;Almasy?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Humbly at your service, milady.  Here, give me your hand.&quot;  
</P>

<P>
&quot;How...why?&quot; she sputtered, gently pulled along.
</P>

<P>
&quot;My father kicked me out of his house,&quot; he said.  &quot;I don't think I'll be in any more trouble for accompanying you for a few days.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;A few days...?&quot; she began, and fell silent. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Yes, just until you realize that you're being very silly and are just the same as anyone else here.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Ah.  To tell the truth, I hadn't planned on coming back....&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;What?&quot; 
</P>

<P>
Miserikordi crashed into his chest.  &quot;I don't belong here,&quot; she said, backing up a few steps.  &quot;Well, that's how I feel now.  A while on the road might change that.&quot;
</P>

<P>
He was silent except for the sound of his breathing.  &quot;Well, let's hope so,&quot; he said finally. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;It's very dangerous outside, Miseri.  There's Humans and Dwarves crawling all over the place, and no telling what kinds of Tunare-worshipping monsters--&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Please, Almasy,&quot; she interrupted.  &quot;I know it won't be easy, but this is something I need to do, with or without you.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I'm sorry, Miseri.  I'm just...worried for you.  I'll come along and protect you, even if it's from yourself.  We're at the entrance now, so be careful where you step.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Miserikordi grimaced briefly as the morning light hit her eyelids, warm and golden.  She relaxed after a moment, and turned her head to listen to the songbirds greeting the sun.
</P>

<P>
&quot;All of this disgusts me,&quot; Almasy muttered. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;I thought you'd say that,&quot; she laughed.
