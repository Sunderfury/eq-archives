[B]To increase faction with heretics I've found the best way to do it is not to kill the erudin guards, doing so will give the following faction adjustments +Heretics, -deepwater knights, -gate callers, -craft keepers and -crimson hands.  Instead go to Freeport docks, swim out to the beach and look for Bait Masterson or his place holder Giz Dintree.  If you are high enough level...kill these two over and over to get the follow faction adjustments: Bait Masterson +Heretics, -High Council of Erudin, -Deepwater Knights...Giz Dintree +Guards of Qeynos, +Wolves of Tunare, +Guardians of the Vale, +Carson McCabe, -Circle of Unseen Hands,-Coalition of Tradefolk, -Corrupt Qeynos Guards.  The spawn rate is about 5 min and gives you enough time to do the note to Janam/Note to Rebby quests in the sewers which helps you to raise faction with freeport militia caolition of tradesfolk 1 and 3 carson mccabe and corrupt qeynos guards.  Still trying to find an easy way to improve faction with circle of unseen hands.

Here is a couple of people you can kill.  Bait Masterson in Freeport by the docks or in Qeynos Catacombs (sometimes) faction +heretics -high council of erudin -deepwater knights.  Bait Mastersons place holder in freeport is Giz Dintree +gurads of Qeynos, +Wolves of North, +Guardians of the vale, +Carson MacCabe -Ebon Mask (monks?).  His placeholder in catacombs i think is a skeleton.  In West Karanas, just as you zone in from Qeynos hills and come out of the mountain pass you will see 1 or 2 clerics.  Killing Brother Estle or Brother Chintle +bloodsabers -priests of life, -knights of thunder, -guars of qeynos -antonius bayle (this guy really hates me).  There is a third Brother that shows up, he is secretly a bloodsaber, killing him will not destroy your faction with the bloodsabers and is often necessary if you are gonna camp there for awhile killing the clerics.  His name is Brother Trintle.  If you camp there you will notice every once and awhile some npc will run by you.  I decided to see what factions these guy had...guess what +bloodsabers -priest of life -knights of truth -guards of qeynos -antonius bayle (some of their names are tolony marle, habastash giki, kyle rinlin, gomo limerin, greblin sneztop i think its a random name generator).  After killing these guys i suggest you head to black burrow for a little bit and kill gnolls to improve faction with qeynos guards.  There is also a high level cleric in North Karanas called Brother Nallin, blue at lvl 38, I'm afraid to kill him cause he spawns near the white bridge where all the guards like to hang out.  Another cleric is in South Karanas called Brother Drash (looks like a splitpaw gnoll) +bloodsabers, -priests of life, -knights of thunder -guards of qeynos, -antonius bayle.  In qeynos newbie area there is a guy named Lashun Novashine killing him also same factions as the clerics. Qeynos Hills killing Neclo Rheslar +bloodsabers +opal darkbriar -guards of qeynos -order of three (some kind of wizard guild).  Be prepared to kill lots and lots of these guys.  Im a bloodsaber and have killed probably close to 50 of them and my faction with my guild is still only amiable...probably cause ive had to kill some bloodsabers along the way to figure out who to kill and who not to kill.  Let me know forget Milea Clothspinner in East Karanas in the gorge on the way to HPH.  +Bloodsabers, +Opal Dark Briar, +Corrupt Qeynos Guards -Priests of Life, -Guards of Qeynos.  She drops a veil that you can give to one of the clerics in the bloodsaber guild for some experience.  Actually, if you are in Freeport there is a quest involving Milea called hopeless love on alakazams website where you deliver a message from her lover +steel warriors, +guards of qeynos, +knights of truth -corrupt guards of qeynos -freeport militia.  Then you simply kill her and bring her veil to the bloodsabers.  Now for people you don't want to kill...dont kill necros in general...although Im not sure about some of them...I think the necros out in Rathe Mountains might be fair game, but dont quote me on this one.  Don't kill the skeleton guards in Qeynos Catacombs +Guards of Qeynos +Priests of Life, -Bloodsabers -Opal Dark Briar -Corrupt Qeynos Guards.  In Qeynos hills dont kill Tovax Vmar or Pyzjin (same factions as above).  Some Qeynos guards are corrupt...killing them +guards of qeynos, -corrupt qeynos guards -bloodsabers -kane bayle -circle of unseen hands (i think this is qeynos rogue guild, generally you want a good faction with any rogues).  If anyone has any additions to this list please let me know.  I would like to get my faction back up to warmly or kindly with my guild to see if they have installed any new quests (wishful thinking).</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
