<H1>Teir'Dal Tailoring Guide, by Zolor of The Nameless</H1>

<P> 
Tailoring is a great money-making skill for the Teir'dal, especially
for lower levels.  You can easily make a fairly good income with this
skill and there's not a huge investment required to get started as in
smithing or jewelcraft, since some of the raw components (pelts and
silks) can be looted from monsters you hunt.  I started tailoring around
level 4, and by level 9 I had earned enough platinum to buy myself
almost an entire suit of small banded armor as well as a Shiny Brass
Halberd (WELL over 150pp in value).  I also helped finance my partner
Aundrea (a Teir'dal Enchantress) getting started making jewelery, which
is a real money pit at low levels.
</P>

<P>
First of all, in order to get started, you obviously need to put some
practice points into the Tailoring skill in your guild.  The more you
put in at first, the less likely your chance of failures.  I started
tailoring at 4th level (as a Shadow Knight) and from fourth to about
sixth level all my practice points went into Tailoring.  I've heard of 
a trick (mentioned below) that could possibly allow you to raise your
tailoring skill up to 17 without expending ANY practice points, but I
have not verified that it works yet.  
</P>

<P> 
To start out with, I suggest you purchase a small sewing kit and
some patterns.  These can be purchased from several locations (listed
below), with the small sewing kit selling for approximately 5gp and the
patterns around 5-6sp each.
</P>

<P> 
At this time you cannot buy large sewing kits or all of the sewing
patterns in Neriak.  The closest place I've found to buy these items is
from from Spoolie Gee at the Inn closest to Freeport in Northern Ro.  Be
careful traveling into the human Inns...Dark Elves are usually KOS
(Kill-On-Sight) until they've raised enough faction with the merchants
around the Freeport and Commonlands area.  This can be done by killing
LOTS of Orcs and performing assorted quests to gain favor with the
humans.  Even if you are not KOS, they still will not sell to you unless
you con &quot;apprehensively&quot; or above.
</P>

<P>
If you don't want to wait until your faction is good enough to purchase
from the humans, one option is to have a non-evil character or a Dark
Elf Enchanter of 8th level using an &quot;Illusion: Half-Elf&quot; spell
(or something similar) to purchase the patterns and large sewing kit for
you.  If you DO get these patterns and the large sewing kit you will
have a DISTINCT advantage over your other would-be Teir'dal competitors,
who don't have them, and perhaps don't even know WHERE to get them.  :-)
</P>

<P>
At lower levels, whenever you kill a black wolf or shadow wolf, keep
those pelts!  The &quot;ruined wolf pelts&quot; are used for making
small patchwork armor, and the &quot;shadow wolf pelts&quot; are used
for making shadow silk (for a Necromancer quest in Solusek).  Also, once
you start killing large spiders, KEEP THOSE SPIDER SILKS!  The
spiderling silk is worthless for tailoring, but the large spider silks
are used for making raw and cured silk armor.
</P>

<P>
Whenever you get a ruined wolf pelt, put the pelt and a sewing pattern
into your sewing kit and click &quot;Combine&quot;.  If you are
successful you will get a piece of small patchwork armor.  These can be
sold for around 2-3gp per piece, or you can do what I usually do and
just give them to newbies sitting around the newbie log.  There isn't
much profit to be made making patchwork, so you're just basically
getting your skill up so you can start making raw silk armor.  Also, by
giving away free patchwork armor, you're losing maybe 6-7 sp per piece
for the pattern (which isn't very much) but you're getting your
tailoring skill up and you are helping another player, generating
goodwill and publicity for yourself.  Those low-level characters you're
helping might someday be high level characters, and then whenever 
they need some tailoring done, they will remember that helpful
tailor in Nektulos Forest!  The ruined bear pelts can be used for making
patchwork armor for our Ogre and Troll brothers and sisters who
sometimes visit our lands, and once again it's great for gaining
goodwill with other players.  Ruined cat pelts (found in East and West
Commonlands, among other places) can be used for making medium-sized
armor, which can be worn by humans as well as elves.
</P>

<P>
I try to keep a large supply of ruined pelts pelts in the bank, since occasionally I
will get a request for an entire set of patchwork armor.  I usually
charge 5pp for an entire set of patchwork armor, which consists of 13
pieces.  If you don't keep a supply of pelts, it's very time consuming to
run around madly killing wolves or bears in order to fill an order,
especially after you've risen high enough in level that the wolves and
bears con green and seldom drop loot.
</P>

<P>
While you're collecting pelts and making patchwork, anytime you get two
large spider silks put them in your sewing kit and click &quot;Combine&quot; 
and if successful you will get a silk swatch.  These swatches are stackable, and 
you definitely want to save them for making silk armor.  I wouldn't try making 
raw silk until your skill level is high enough that patchwork is trivial, since 
each failure early on is one less swatch of silk you could be making a profit on 
later!  
</P>

<P>
Making silk swatches becomes trivial around skill level 17, and making
patchwork armor becomes trivial around skill level 26 or so.  When you
hit this level you are ready to (FINALLY!) start making raw silk armor
and realizing some real profit from all of this.
</P>

<P>
Raw silk armor is made by combining the right amounts of silk swatches
with the appropriate pattern in your sewing kit.  Raw silk robes and
leggings require two swatches of silk, while all other pieces only
require one.  For the robes and leggings, make sure you don't put the
two silk swatches in your sewing kit stacked!  It will not work if you
do!  I normally sell the robes and leggings for 4pp each, and all other
pieces sell for 2pp each.  If you do the math, you will see that this
comes out to 30pp for a full set of raw silk armor, which is pretty good
money for a player below level 10!  The raw silk armor is very popular
with mid-level spell-casters and monks, who want something better than
cloth armor and have the funds to buy it.
</P>

<P>
I usually carry my large sewing kit and two backpacks full of all of the
assorted patterns with me at all times.  I also try to keep an ample
supply of silk swatches on me at all times.  Whenever I'm sitting down
and healing, I do an &quot;auction&quot; that I am selling raw silk armor, and 
if I find a buyer I can make it on the spot and make a quick and tidy profit 
while I am resting.  
</P>

<P> 
Once the large spiders in Nektulos Forest start conning green to you,
you have other options for obtaining more silk.  You can either go to
other places to hunt tougher spiders, or you can pay lower level
characters to &quot;harvest&quot; it for you.  The Giant Spiders in the
Commonlands and the Desert Tarantulas in Northern/Southern Ro and Oasis
drop silk, and the Carrion and Crag spiders in the Karanas drop silk as
well.  The Desert Tarantulas and Carrion Spiders seem to be around level
12-15 or so, but the Crag Spiders in the Karanas go up to over level 20!
I have seen these Crag spiders drop as much as EIGHT silks from a single kill, so once
you're powerful enough it might be worth a trip over there to harvest
silk.
</P>

<P>
If you prefer to buy your silk, the going rate for large spider silk
seems to be 3-5gp each.  You can still kill spiders even though they con
green, and occasionally get silk, but once again it's EXTREMELY time
consuming!
</P>

<P> 
Once your tailoring skill hits around 36 or so, making raw silk armor
will become trivial, and you will need to move onto Studded Leather
Armor in order to advance your skill.  Making Studded Leather Armor is a
nuisance because there is no real market for it.  However, to do this you
need to make or buy some studs from a blacksmith, and collect some
Medium-Quality pelts.  The only place I know of that has MQ wolf pelts
is Qeynos Hills, so it'll probably be easier to just use MQ cat and bear
pelts.  If you're going to try studded, I recommend that you just make
studded masks and sell them to the vendor, until it trivials out around
skill level 56 or so.
</P>

<P> 
What I've done, however, is give up on studded, since it is WAY too
time-consuming and expensive just to get my smithing skill high enough to
make the studs.  I've moved straight from raw silk to cured silk armor,
and although I still get a lot of failures my skill is slowly moving up.
</P>

<P>
To make cured silk armor, you will probably want to take up the Brewing skill.
You will need this skill to make the Heady Kiolas used for curing the silk.  
This is a tailoring guide, so I won't go into a lot of detail about brewing
here, but basically you take two Kiola saps, one flask of water, and a bottle
and you combine them in the Brewing Barrel (similar to a Forge or Oven) to
make a Heady Kiola.  Brewing is cheap and easy to learn, and actually my brewing
skill is already higher than my tailoring, and all I've done is make Heady Kiolas!
</P>

<P>
Once you have made a bunch of Heady Kiolas, combine one Heady Kiola, one
swatch of silk, and one mask pattern in your sewing kit to (hopefully!)
make a Cured Silk Veil.  You can try to sell them to other players, (2pp
per AC seems to be a fair price for cured silk) or give them away to
monks in East Commonlands to (once again!)  get a good reputation as a
friendly and generous tailor.  Cured Silk doesn't trivial out until
around skill level 82 or so (I'm not there yet!), so you will get a LOT
of failures if you are going straight to cured silk from raw silk.  I'm
going to stick with this method and see how it works, I will continue to
update this guide as I progress.
</P>

<P>
I haven't progressed beyond Cured Silk yet, so I cannot comment much on
making 10-item backpacks or Wu's Fighting Guantlets.  However, I am
including the recipes below for completeness.
</P>

<P>
One final note...I read this on another guide when I was starting out,
and it's very good advice so I pass it along as well.  ALWAYS be polite
and friendly to customers.  You will occasionally get people who accuse
you of having outrageous prices, or are down-right insulting.  I always
strive to be polite to them, to the point of absurdity.  You will also
get people who want to haggle with you on prices (either buying armor or
selling you silk).  Use your best judgement on this, but always remember
you can say &quot;no&quot; to a deal.  The only real concession I will ever make 
is that I will usually make raw silk for half-price, if they provide all the
silk.  That way I'm not dipping into my own stock, and they're paying me
almost a platinum piece just for my time and a 6sp pattern.  If you're
friendly and courteous, your reputation will spread, and you will find
yourself getting tells from people you've never met asking you if you can
make them some armor.
