<P>
Greetings all travelers.  Bard Mistsong at your service.  
A tale?  A tale you wish to hear?  How about one of truth, of injustice, of vengence...
</P>
 
<P>
Long ago when the world was young, elves and dwarves shattered the land with their greed and selfishness.  LONG before Humans and trolls...there were dragons.  Kings and Queens of the world, rulers of all they saw.  They lived peacefully and enjoyed a life of warless ages.  A life where they could express joy, raise children and commune with the Wyrm Queen in peace.<BR>
It was Utopia.
</P>
 
<P>
Then Brell came along.  With his deceit and his cunning.  Not asking to share the world with them nor giving any consideration to those that were there.  He planted his seed within the bowels of the world, hidden from all that would pass over.  He called to the other gods and they each brought their own beings to this once lush land.  The dragons' peace was over.  
</P>
 
<P>
They would have been willing to share and they would have been willing to live in peace but the pestulence that was placed on and within the world grew and started destroying the dragons.  Killing hatchlings and babies..killing mothers and fathers without reguard to the sanctity of life.  The sorrow of the dragons grew and turned to fury.  Thus the dragons of today were born.  Filled with hatred and anger for what has been done to them.  They went out seeking vengence for lost ones.  Tearing anything that crossed their paths limb from limb.  Each bite, each claw, each blast of fire and power a cry, a tear for babies, mothers, fathers.  Dragons who had done nothing to deserve such fate were fighting back.
</P>
 
<P>
The nasty races brought to the world banded together and shattered the homes and lives of the remaining dragons.  They fought and fought hard  but it was a losing battle.  Haggered and withdrawn they pulled back to the safty of hidden caves, places unknown to any but their own and some of those that fought beside them against such injustice.
</P>

<P>
Now they wait.  They wait till the races grow weak and they grow strong again.  Wait till those that know of their pain..knows what it is like to be outcast from their own race or races..to gather in servitude and strength.  A war is coming, people.  A war that is building and has for centuries.  Half-elves, Drow, any that were shunned from their people. Any that know the pain and suffering of injustice done to them.  Any that know the loss of a child, a mother, a father.  All will gather to fight those that caused this, those that will cause it again.  Oh yes. A war is comming and you are it's focus.
</P>

<P>
Beware, people, for the dragons who were once kind and happy beings are waiting.<BR>
You are next.
