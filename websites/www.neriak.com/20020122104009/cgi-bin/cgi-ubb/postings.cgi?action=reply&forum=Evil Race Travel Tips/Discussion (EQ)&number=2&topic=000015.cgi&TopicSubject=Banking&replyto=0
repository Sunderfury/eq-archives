If you would like to do buisness with the Humans then kill all the orcs you can in order to gain better factions with them.  The only other option is to use "illusion".<P>------------------<BR>------------------<BR>Mekdawa<BR>6th tier Necromancer of Neriak<BR>Methaniel Marr<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#303070"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Jaen Stormtide</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Actually, if you're careful in North Freeport and if you're an agnostic and maybe a few other religions, you can bank in North Freeport with no faction adjustments.  Just don't get too comfy in the city, since there's KOS Npcs scattered pretty liberally through the city.  I dunno about other religions, but my necromancer friend was not KOS in the majority of East and West Freeport.  I tend to kill any deathfist orc I walk by, so that's solved somewhat.<P>Also (I don't know if this works for any other religions) if you take a load of bandages (About 100) with you to Misty Thicket, you can secure a banking and selling spot in Rivervale.  Since I've been hunting King Xorbb's Gorge, East K, and Runnyeye, I'm dubious to warmly in MOST of Rivervale, except for the clerics who are KOS.  Just be careful not to do any other quests in Rivervale other than the bandages otherwise you WILL end up KOS in Neriak.  Also an added bonus of killing goblins is Butcherblock will open up a little bit to you.<P>Qeynos above ground, I don't know about, but Bandits, cheap quests, and Gnolls should fix that pretty quick.  There's a bank in the Catacombs too in the temple of Bertoxx, I believe.  Again, be careful.<P>For the realms of the Lesser 'Dal, I've seen a Teir'Dal warrior go from KOS to Warmly in Kelethin by slaughtering orcs.  Just be prepared to switch guilds and run from the Fairy Folk.<P>*thinks*  That's all I can think of for light races.<p>[This message has been edited by Jaen Stormtide (edited February 15, 2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#202050"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Mekdawa</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">I've been slaying orcs and I am seen as dubious to Freeport guards, but have been KOSed by a few NPC's in Freeport.

I am making the assumption that you are a DE Necro here.<BR>In queynos you will have no problems banking. There is a banker in the sewers for the followers of innoruuk.<BR>FP is a big nono no matter what, even if you raise your faction enough to bank (which you can't do by default) 1/2 of the NPC walking around in NFP are KOS to you and you have virtually no way to raise this. Stay away from anyone with 'Sir' or 'Lady' in front of their names no matter what. Also you can bank in Oggok for sure and Grobb probably (although I have not tried never had to).<P>In short from the start you can bank in Neriak, Oggok, Queynos. with just a bit of work (not all that much) you can use the normal bank in Queynos as well.<P>Hope this helped.<BR>Meph</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#202050"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Scarlatta Bloodmoon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">aaaaahh yes,bankin'..<BR>what do do with all that beautiful loot and money. Up until I gained faction to bank in HPH,I handled that LITTLE problem as a roleplay might. I had a slave.<BR>REALLY: I created a "slave character" to do my bankin',buy food, and many items in places that were closed to me. A word of wisdom, make "slave" a very useful class like a druid or or enchanter you can get a lot of mileage from.<P>------------------<BR>Smile hon, cause<BR>Scarlatta loves ya...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#303070"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Wiite Rabbyt</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Banking can be a sore spot in the lands of the Light-Skins.  I agree with most of what has been said here, but to reiterate;<BR>In North Freeport where the bank is we are generally KOS to many of the inhabitants, though we can trave the rest of Freeport in relative safety.  There is a banker in the catacombs accessed through East freeport whom we can use.<BR>In Queynos visit blackburrow and kill gnolls, collecting the Gnoll tooths which you hand to the captain in the arena when you are dubious or better for a faction increase.  The bank here is in south queynos like the arena.<BR>We can of course use the banks in grobb and oggok for they are as evil as we.<BR>Lastly when you visit the Overthere in Kunark we can bank there whether we can use the merchants or not. (Personally i killed too many ogre raiders on Timrous Deep and lost faction with the merchants and cannot sell there but i am still able to use the bank).<P>Wiite Rabbyt<BR>Clan Nan Duibhre<BR>Prexus Server</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
