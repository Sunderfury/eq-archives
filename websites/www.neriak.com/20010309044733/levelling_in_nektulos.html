<P>
A lot of people complain about Nektulos as a newbie zone.  They say it sucks, 
they say they can't level a character there, and so on.  Well I say they are 
wrong, and after having levelled 4 or 5 characters to 15 in Nektulos and two 
adjoining zones, I feel I'm qualified to comment on this matter. :)
</P>

<H3>Levels 1-5</H3>

<P>
For your pure newbie days, levels one through five, you fight at the newbie log.  
To get there, head straight out from the cave leading into Neriak, bear a tiny 
bit right, until you come to a road.  Take the road straight and soon you will 
come to an area with a huge tree stump standing on the right side, and a large 
fallen log on the left side.  This is the newbie log.  Fight close to the log -- 
DO NOT stray across the road near the stump - level 8-11 monsters spawn near 
there.  Fight things that give you experience (anything that /cons blue or 
higher), and base your attacks on your knowledge of your class and how much 
twink equipment you have.  Once you hit level 4 or 5 (again depending on class 
and twink equipment), you can go across the street and fight shadow wolves and 
black bears.  Skeletons and Young Kodiaks will likely still kill you so avoid 
them.  Unless you are a Cleric, don't fight Tree Snakes as their venom will kill 
you unless cured quickly.
</P>

<H3>Levels 6-8 (9 at latest)</H3>

<P>
Now you've graduated from the newbie log and it's time to head to the Skeleton 
Rune.  To get there, follow the road that led you to the log.  You'll cross a 
huge bridge -- DO NOT swim in that water unless you want to feed the piranha. 
Keep going until you reach an obvious zone tunnel -- this goes to East 
Commonlands, you don't want to go there yet, so turn left instead and you will 
see the Skeleton Rune, it's a large monument thing around which Skeletons, 
Zombies, and Lesser Mummies spawn.  You can kill the Skeletons, and they are 
good EXP and loot -- save up the bonechips to sell to high level Necromancers.  
You probably can't handle the Zombies or Mummies yet, so either group up with 
others to try to take them out, or /shout for a higher level player to come and 
waste them.  You should be able to get to level 8 fairly easily, and 9 with 
trouble (since once you hit level 8 much of the spawns will be green) here at 
the Rune.
</P>

<H3>Levels 8/9-11/12</H3>

<P>
Now it's time to head into Eastern Commonlands.  Once you exit the zone tunnel 
head right across the zone wall, and down a bit onto the plains area.  You 
should find plenty of things that will give you good EXP -- giant scarabs, young 
kodiaks, giant spiders, lions, and lionesses are all good targets.  Avoid 
darkweed snakes as they hit hard and their poison is even worse.  You might also 
want to group up and hit one of the Orc Camps.  This zone will take you to level 
11 or 12 with ease.  The only big problem with this zone are Griffins (approx. 
level 35 and very aggressive -- if you see one, get your /loc and /shout griff 
near [loc] and a high level player will likely come kill it), and the guards -- 
they hate Dark Elves, Trolls, and Ogres, so watch out for them.
</P>

<P>
Another option in this range is to head into the dungeon Befallen, reachable
via the Western Commonlands.  You'd need to group, and I don't have much
experience with this dungeon, but many people swear by it.  Ask around. :)
</P>

<H3>Levels 11/12-15/16/17</H3>

<P>
You've hit the semi-bigtime now, it's time to head into Lavastorm Mountains!  To 
get there, follow the zone wall to the right upon exiting Neriak until you see 
an obvious zone tunnel -- this will be Lavastorm.  There are lots of things that 
are excellent EXP and loot here, but you <STRONG>will</STRONG> need to group up!  
You can pull to the exit of the zone tunnel, or to the small flat area a little 
to the left of it.  Fire Elementals (depending on /con, some are very tough), 
Rock Dervishes, Fire Imps, Fire Drakes, and Lava Crawlers are all good targets 
-- depending on /con, your group size and makeup, and equipment levels.  If you 
are fighting something with a fireshield (you get the message &quot;YOU are 
burned!&quot; everytime you hit it), have one of your casters cast the spell 
Cancel Magic on it until you don't get the burned anymore.  This will save you 
from much downtime and many deaths.  You can get yourself to level 15 or 16 or 
17 here pretty easily, 15 being very easy and 16 and 17 taking some patience to 
find things that /con blue or higher.  
</P>

<H3>Beyond</H3>

<P>
Now it's pretty much time to leave the Neriak/Nektulos area for the rest of the 
world.  You probably have a lot of friends by now, many of whom you group with 
regularly.  Upper Guk, Unrest, and many other zones are open to you now... 
Enjoy!
