<center><b>Twink</b><br></center>

<p>The term "twink" means a new character that has been outfitted by a player with medium to high-level armor/weapons/equipment/money. Some roleplayers frown upon twinked characters, but it is a facet of life in EverQuest that people must accept. People are goind to do it, whether we like it or not.</p>
