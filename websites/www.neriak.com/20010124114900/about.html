Neriak.COM is a side project maintained by several players.  The main authors and maintainers are Zariu 
and Sevok/Sylad/Cadendakor (husband and wife in real life).  To clear up possible problems later, I'll 
state right now -- we play on <STRONG>Xegony</STRONG> only -- if someone on another server claims to be us, 
they aren't.

If you'd like to help out with posting news, email <A

like posting access, how often you'll be able to update news, and so on.

We started this site because there is no other Dark Elf (and Dark Race in general) specific information site 
we could find.  There's a lot of general sites with tons and tons of class guides and such, but nothing at 
all specifically for Dark Elves/Dark Races only.  So here we are... Neriak.COM.  We welcome all comments, 
suggestions, and so forth via <A HREF="mailto:keeper@neriak.com">email</A>.
</P>

<P>
If you'd like to help out with site content, that's great!  We are looking
for: guides of all kinds - class, skill, trade, hunting, travel, and so
forth; fiction - character histories, lore and background pieces on various
aspects of Norrathian culture; anything else you feel would fit.  Any of
this of course needs to be from a Dark Race (Dark Elf, Troll, or Ogre)
perspective - and we are especially looking for material from Troll and Ogre
perspectives as we only have experience playing Dark Elves.  If you'd like
to write for the site, write up your piece and email it to <A
HREF="mailto:keeper@neriak.com">keeper@neriak.com</A>.
