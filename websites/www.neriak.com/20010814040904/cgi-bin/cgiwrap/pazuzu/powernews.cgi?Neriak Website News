		A few people have emailed us asking for more specifics and/or clarification on what we're looking for in submissions.<p><STRONG>General Guidelines:</STRONG><p>1. We can only accept submissions in English.  The site is in English, the game is in English, and so this doesn't seem unreasonable...<p>2. Textual submissions should be made via email (to <A HREF="mailto:keeper@neriak.com">keeper@neriak.com</A>) in <STRRONG>plain text</STRONG>.  Please do not attach Word Processor (MS Word, Wordperfect, etc) documents, or any other kind of documents (including HTML).  Please simply cut-and-paste the text of your submission into the Email body. <p>3. Graphical submissions (maps, artwork, etc), should be made via normal email attachment (to the same email address as above).  Please send only JPEG (.JPG files) or GIF (.GIF files) graphics.  These are the standards for graphics on the Web so this shouldn't be a problem.  Please pay close attention to the filesize of your graphics.  If at all possible, compress them so that they are under 100k (100,000 bytes) in size.<p>4. I'm really not sure how to convey this, but...  All content needs to be "suitable" for posting.  We're not going to post anything like The Famous Story That Got That Guy Banned™.  We're sorry, but we really can't take that sort of risk.  Violence is fine, but there's a fine line that's up to our discretion.  Even hinted sexual content is fine (as in one of Szardos' stories), but again there's a fine line and it will come down to a judgement call by us and us alone.  If you're at all unsure if your submission will be accepted or not, just submit it!  The worst we will do is say "No, we're sorry, we can't use this." and that's that.<p>5. We reserve the right to edit textual submissions for spelling and grammar.  This means that if you submit a story or other textual item, and the spelling and grammar need cleaning up, we have the right to do so.  This is the only type of editing we will ever make to a submission.<p>6. Copyrights on submissions are retained by the author, and by making a submission you grant us the right to publish said work on our site for the period of six months.  After the six months has expired, you may request that your work be taken off the site, or elect to leave it (and certainly we prefer if you let us keep it on the site!).  This is a fairly standard Web submission "contract", we are just stating it up front =)<p><STRONG>Types of Submissions:</STRONG><p>These are the types of things we are looking for.<p>1. Stories.  Any stories about Everquest-related things can be submitted, so long as they fit the site; that is, are from the perspective of, or involve, evil races and/or classes.  These can be totally fictional, or can be about actual things which have happened to you in the game told in a story form.  You can also make up stories and lore to explain things in the world that are not explained by the Verant-provided Fiction.  An example of that would be the story of the origin of the glowing signs in Neriak that has been archived here since Day 1.  There are many, many examples of the types of stories we are looking for -- you need only look at our current offerings =)<p>2. Character Biographies.  We like these especially. =)  Please submit only bios of evil race/class characters; the "Foe" section of the bios is going to be removed shortly and will not be returning.  <p>3. Guides.  We love (and need!) guides.  Class Guides, Skill Guides, Travel Guides, Guide Guides, you name it!  We especially need Trade Skill Guides from evil race/class perspectives.  Szardos is working on a series of these, but it's our belief that one can never have enough information! (Even though Szardos' work is always more than perfect!).  We are missing a huge amount of guides we consider necessary: Shaman, Shadow Knight, Enchanter, Warrior, and so on.  Also, we have no Iksar, Troll, Ogre, or Evil Erudite/Human/Gnome-specific guides or information.  A big hole indeed; someone please fill it!  Guides can be either In Character or Out Of Character (though we prefer IC, we realize that with some things you need to step OOC to get things across correctly).  Quest Guides (Necro epic? SK epic? Shaman epic for evil Shaman? Rogue epic for DE Rogues? Etc...) are also highly desired!<p>4. Maps.  We have authorization to use a large collection of excellent maps (Zealott's, in fact) and will be putting those online very soon, but again... One can never have too much!<p>5. Artwork.  Any artwork you think we might like to display (and yes, this can include interesting screen shots) can also be submitted.  Please be repsectful and follow the guidelines set forth above for graphical submissions. Especially pay attention to file size. =)<p>6. Anything else? If in doubt, just submit it!  The worst we will do is say no! =)<p>Hopefully this clears things up, and again the email address for submissions (and questions, suggestions, etc) is <A HREF="mailto:keeper@neriak.com">keeper@neriak.com</A>.<p>

		Szardos Speaks<p>    My Brothers and Sisters in Shadow.  I am Szardos, called the Hotspur, gentleman and rogue of the Server Tunare.  Recently, I was done a great wrong.  A miscreant posted my stories verbatim on another website without permission.  Worse, he claimed (among other things) to have been the author of the stories, asserting that he had been Szardos of Tunare and had sold the account.  I was immediately alerted by the most excellent Keepers of this site, and the miscreant and his flimsy lies were refuted and sent packing.  Make no mistake.  My work is protected and not to be used without express permission.  A link to this worthy site is acceptable, but nothing more.  I <br>submit my stories and guides exclusively to this website alone, so If you see my work posted on another website, contact this site immediately, for it has been posted illegally.  If you need to contact me, a submission to the Keepers will be sufficient, for they know my true email address and, indeed, my true name.<br>    Know this, gentle readers: I created Szardos on Tunare and play him to this day.  I will never sell the account.  Szardos dies when Verant dies and takes Everquest with it and not before.  If you see me on Tunare, know that it is I and I alone.  Trust no other Szardos on any other site unless you see a post from me on this site telling you otherwise.  Likewise believe no player using the name of any of my characters except, on the Tunare Server, the characters called Bracewell the Bard, Wrathbone the Shadowknight, Oopz the Shaman (all of whom I also play) and dear Enoyna the Enchantress (played <br>by she with whom I am fortunate enough to share my life).  To speak with them is to speak with me (for Enoyna will relay any messages to me).  I also hold the EZBoard Account name of Szardos Hotspur.  I use that name alone.  If anyone posts under another name and asserts that he is me, he is lying.  It is a pity that I must take these steps to assert my rights and my identity, but the world is harsh, and such steps must needs be taken.<br>    This is a fine website, run by noble Keepers who merit your patronage and voice in their forums and libraries.  Support them and contribute to their site, for you will find that they will support you in return.  Noble Sevok, Worthy Zariu, I honor you for your friendship and loyalty.<p>May the shadows be kind to you all, my brethren.<p>I remain,<p>The Sole and True<p>Szardos Hotspur,<p>As of this writing, a<br>Gentleman & Rogue of the Twenty-Second Circle of Mastery<br>Tunare<p>My way is Shadow; My ally, Silence; My virtue, Surprise.<br>My creed? If you can't be Good, be Elegant.<br>
