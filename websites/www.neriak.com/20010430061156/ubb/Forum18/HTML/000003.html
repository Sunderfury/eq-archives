</FONT><HR>	Master Hekzin G’Zule delighted in telling the most wonderful stories when I was but a young lad in the Hall of the Ebon Mask.  Teaching stories, he called them, although they were also highly entertaining in their own right as well.  There was one ... how did it go again?  Ah, yes.<P>	A high elf paladin and his over-armored and ridiculously ostentatious entourage were passing through the West Commonlands one fine summer day.  This paladin was particularly nasty, as far as these zealots go, and often boasted about the number of rogues, especially Teir’Dal rogues he had slain in his time.  Well, they were on their way to the mystic circle when a young Teir’Dal stepped out of the shadows of the trees.  The young rogue then challenged the paladin to a duel to the death.  The paladin considered the ragged young rogue, clad merely in patchwork leather, compared to the magnificent, intricately etched and decorated finel steel plate he himself wore (Side joke: what do you call a mincing High Elf in ribbons and lace? Manly.) and tittered politely.  He took in the rather ordinary rapier the Teir’Dal carried, compared to the gleaming enchanted broadsword at his hip and giggled with amusement.<BR>	Nonplussed, the Tier’Dal then proceeded with elegant and exquisite detail to list extensively the paladin’s mental, physical, sexual and spiritual shortcomings.  Not halfway through his recitation did the paladin roar with anger and stride forth to accept the challenge.<BR>	“Nay,” one of his entourage cried, and hefted his axe.  “He is not worth your exertions.”  And the axeman told the Teir’Dal he would take up the challenge.  The Teir’Dal then grinned and bowed and said “Come on then!” and ran into the woods.  And the axeman went forth.  There was a sound of steel meeting steel and a great cry, and then the Teir’Dal appeared once more.  With a smile as wide as the horizon, he threw the axeman’s ringmail helm at the paladin’s feet.  “An appetizer,” the Teir’Dal remarked, “No more.”  And again he challenged the paladin.<BR>	“Nay,” cried another of the paladin’s entourage, and drew forth his longsword.  “He is not worth your exertions.”  And the swordsman told the Teir’Dal he would take up the challenge.  The Teir’Dal then grinned and bowed and said “Come on then!” and ran into the woods.  And the swordsman went forth.  Again there was a sound of steel meeting steel and a great cry, and the Teir’Dal appeared once more, casting the swordsman’s banded helm at the paladin’s feet.  “Really,” the Teir’dal remarked, “You must pay very little for your guardsmen, this being their quality.”  And again he challenged the paladin.<BR>	“Nay,” yet another of the paladin’s entourage cried, and unslung the claymore from his back.  “He is not worth your exertions.”  And the warrior told the Teir’Dal he would take up the challenge.  The Teir’Dal then grinned and bowed and said “Come on then!” and ran into the woods.  And the warrior went went forth.  Yet again was there the sound of steel meeting steel and a great cry and, unthinkably, the Teir’Dal appeared again with his maddening smile and cast the warrior’s bronze helmet at the paladin’s feet.<BR>	Fully sixteen times was this drama replayed, until only the paladin stood alone to face the jeers of the ragged young Teir’dal.  Incensed beyond measure, he bounded into the woods, hot upon the heels of his mocking antagonist, and beheld a terrible sight: the bodies of his entourage, arranged in a semicircle, as if watching a play. <BR>They were all seated, some with legs crossed, others hunched as if in concentration.<BR>	This enraged the paladin dearly and he drew his sword.  The Teir’Dal merely smiled, as his dark brother struck the paladin from behind with his dagger, as he had so done with the others, and then finished the paladin off by slipping the point of his rapier into the paladin's self-righteous heart.<P>Now what, Master Hekzin had asked me (after I stopped laughing, that is), was the moral of this little tale?<P>A. Never cause a rogue to consider you his enemy (True enough, but not precisely what Master Hekzin was getting at in this instance).<BR>B. High elves are mental deficients (As much as I do hate to stereotype, there is some merit in this answer as well. However, it also is not the point  Master Hekzin sought to illustrate).<BR>C. A pair of Teir”dal with brains can lay waste to twice their number, despite betters arms and armor (Very close indeed, but not quite there yet).<P>No, the proper answer is this:<P>	When you fight, Fight to Win.  Forget this nonsense of fighting with honor.  There is little honor in killing, little nobility in butchery.  Those whose see otherwise are deluding themselves.  Fighting is about survival.  Oh and remember this: should you ever encounter one of those precious warriors who accuse you of not fighting fairly, or not ‘fighting like a man’, know that what they truly mean to say is: ‘Why are you not standing perfectly still and offering no resistance so I may pummel you with my superior strength and/or weaponry until you die so I may thereafter delude myself into believing I am better than I actually am?”  give them the response they deserve, o<BR>my bretheren.<P>	Ah, Master Hekzin.  A master of wisdom as well as mayhem.  Such a character. <P>[This message has been edited by Szardos (edited October 21, 2000).]<p>[This message has been edited by Szardos (edited October 21, 2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 172.145.28.35</font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum18&number=18&thisthread=000003&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum18&number=18&thisthread=000003&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
