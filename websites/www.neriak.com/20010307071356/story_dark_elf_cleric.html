The wind blew gently through the trees of Nektulos carrying the scents of
Neriak throughout the forest. Dark forces worked feverously trying to master
their skills to better honor Bertoxxulous and Innoruuk. Life was continuing
as normal, at its evil pace. 
</P>

<P>
The Necromancer initiate Salfereet feeling the twinges of pain in her
abdomen sat to rest near the river that ran through the forest, her ever
protective pet made of bone chips handed to her by a friend paced anxiously
awaiting her command. Things began to dim, slowly fading to the embrace of
her beloved, darkness. 
</P>

<P>
Kuff watched the scene with much trepidation. Having made himself invisible
to the undead he did not fear the pet. He knew that if he used his healing
magic to save the evil creature he would quickly find the unappreciative pet
trying to take the last bit of life he had left. Kuff sat and prayed to
Brell, asking what would be the right thing to do. As usual, there was no
answer. He could feel that he might have enough mana left within him to
destroy the pet and still aid the pregnant drow. 
</P>

<P>
Her skin now a pale blue reflecting what little moonlight made its way
through the forest canopy the young necromancer's life slowly drained.
Something began tickling her senses, she felt fear from her pet, and pain. A
loud noise interrupted what would have been her death sleep. Inching her way
up to a seated position Salfereet saw a Dwarf putting the finishing blows on
her pet. She did not recognize the language he spoke but saw nothing but
hatred in his eyes as he tore through the last of the strength of her
summoned creature. It was not fear that motivated her. It was not anger over
her pet. It was her love of darkness that compelled the dying Drow as she
drove her dagger into the thigh of the dwarf. It was her last effort to
please the Plague Bringer. 
</P>

<P>
Kuff looked down into the eyes of the smiling Drow. He knew at once that it
was too late to save her. She had used the last of her energy to do him
harm. He felt the dagger in his thigh but the pain did not register. Tears
were streaming down the face of the sad dwarf recognizing the fact that it
would take longer for him to heal her than she had left alive. He watched as
the eyes lost there joy, the smile still on her face as she slumped to the
ground. Placing his hands upon her he began to utter a prayer for her. A
motion under his hand nearly stopped his heart, and abruptly ended his
prayer. Shocked into utter silence Kuff quickly went to work attempting to
do what this young dark elf had died trying to avoid.

<P>
On a cool and cloudless night, as the wind brought scents of Neriak
throughout the forest, a Dwarven cleric pulled a dark elf away from death,
and into life.
