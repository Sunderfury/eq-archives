</FONT><HR>&lt;ooc&gt;<BR>Hello~!  I am new to this site and new as well to Everquest.  Only started playing late April of this year.  In that short time, however, I have seen what you all have mentioned in older posts re: the Roleplaying on EQ--or lack there of.  I have noticed that the "evil" races in general are both great roleplayers, and great companions.  The "light" races on the other hand have cheated me, stolen from me, and have generally been very poor players and LOUSY Roleplayers.  Case in point, I only have 2 characters on Rodcet Nife--a Half Elf Ranger and a Dark Elf Shadowknight. (Krescent ^_^)  When I am Roleplaying Kres, I can always seem to find someone out in Neriak or the surrounding zones to RP with, or group with--and I haven't had a bad group yet.  When I play my Half Elf Ranger, I cannot find person ONE to RP with (and believe me, she is a social butterfly =P).  I have grouped only twice, and both times, the other players just let me die by the hands of many Crushbone Orcs as they looted the group-killed corpses.  Now, don't get me wrong, the looting is fine, but WATCH OUT FOR YOUR TEAMMATES.. GEEZ.  Plus, being still new, I accidentally dropped my sword (which was given to me by a higher lvl chara that I met, and a very nice sword it was. =( )and one of my "loyal teammates" a High Elf, picked it up and kept it.  When I realized that it was not on the ground (when my inventory screen was off) I asked if anyone saw the sword on the ground.  The person who took it, said that they DID see it, and just laughed.  Needless to say, I never got my sword back, and I hope that the Crushbone Orcs whacked that High Elf good.<P>In general, the Dark Elves, Trolls and Ogres of the land are great at getting into their charas--the Elves, both high and wood--are only concerned with twinking, ports and SOWs. =P<P>Thanks for listening, (if you're still awake)<BR><P>------------------<BR>Krescent (K'res) of Third Gate<BR>12th Rank Shadowknight<BR>Teir'Dal <BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 192.251.125.2</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>Hee hee, someone else has finally seen the light.  Err, dark.  On my server, I only know three elves of the light races to have ever really roleplayed and they have been great teammates.  Three out of the thousands that crawl all over Antonica and Faydwer isn't a great ratio.  And trust me, I've spent plenty of time in front of Kelethin and Felwithe, being inspected and stared at by wood and high elves, to know that most of them do act like it's all just a video game meant to be beaten.  They forget that the other elves and humans wandering around are actual people.  <P>I hate grouping, but as an enchantress and a blind woman it's something I have to do for both game play and roleplaying.  I'm hesitant to ask to join a group anymore;  the last few times I have grouped, the players really screwed me over with their inexperience in groups and plain stupidity: <P>7th level cleric--"The legionairre is red, but he's by himself, so we can take him."<P>8th level paladin--"Are you sure?  He's wandering towards that camp over there..."<P>7th level cleric--"Oh, yeah, but I've power leveled my monk here from level four before, so I know what I'm doing."<P>8th level rogue--"Umm, there's a centurion hitting me, I need a little help..."<P>7th level cleric--"Yeah, one sec.  Go grab that lego, I'll be back in a sec to help you take it."<P>Me, a 7th level enchanter--"Umm, okay..."  <BR>*casts invisibility and watches her group get torn in half by some angry looking red mobs*<P>Based on past experiences with thick headed light races, I will stand near a high traffic area like city gates, and watch for people who are giving shouts for a group.  Then, depending on how they respond to me, I will either politely decline or ask to join them.  The power gamers see me and ask for free loot or pelt me with group invites;  the roleplayers and people who actually get into the game stand for a few seconds and stare before asking politely why the high elven guards haven't turned me into a fine pink mist.  Those people that ask me about my character will listen as I tell about my history and travels.  They are more likely to care whether or not I get jumped by orcs and beaten on, and even twice as likely to start defending me.  The few that I've met like this have helped me a lot.  The few that let me die in a group because they didn't know what to do have lost me experience.  The cleric that wanted to take on angry red legionairres had the gall to /ooc that I was the most stupid dark elf ever for killing orcs and that I would die because of it.  I gave him a tell and told him that I knew exactly what I was doing there and that I was offended by the namecalling.  Yeesh.  Some people.  <P>On the other hand, there was one person I met that switched to a high level character on the other side of the world to help me get my corpse back.  After he showed up (from seven zones away), I already had recovered my body.  I apologized, but he only laughed and began helping me level and gave me bits of armor that I was missing at the time.  Namely everything except the robe I started with.  <P>So, umm, I guess the point that I've been vaguely trying to make is that you should check out the people you group with prior to trusting them with your life and property.  You'll thank me for it later  <IMG SRC="http://www.neriak.com/ubb/wink.gif">    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.39.72.251</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

</FONT><HR>&lt;ooc&gt;<BR>YAY~!! Someone replied to me~! ^_^<BR>&lt;snipsnip&gt;<BR>&gt;great ratio. And trust me, I've spent &gt;plenty of time in front of Kelethin and &gt;Felwithe, being inspected and stared at by &gt;wood and high elves, to know that most of &gt;them do act like it's all just a video game &gt;meant to be beaten. They forget that the &gt;other elves and humans wandering around are &gt;actual people. <P>SO TRUE~!!  And Kelethin/GFay is the WORST in my opinion, because they are only intestested in getting PL'd, SoWs, and free stuff. The Comment about thinking it is a video game hits it SO dead on the spot--they do.  It's sad.  Kresent enjoys just sitting in front of the mountain waterfall in Neriak's Third Gate and just thinking or practicing her jewelcraft.  Its peaceful there, and the guards don't wander by too often to disturb you.<P>My brother has a high lvl wiz and he helped my Ranger in Kelethin get some good starting lvls (so I did't die and loose my stuff in 30 min) and gave me several pieces of good armor and some money (yay for genetic obligations ^_~) Unfortunately, because of the attitudes of the players in Kelethin/GFay, I have lost all interest in my half elf, so today, I deleted her after getting a friend to transfer all my stuff to a new chara--an Erudite Paladin.  I'm hoping I have fun with that one, and maybe at a later date, I will be able to enjoy playing something in Kelethin--its a beautiful city.<P>&gt;them. The power gamers see me and ask for &gt;free loot or pelt me with group invites; &gt;the roleplayers and people who actually get &gt;into the game stand for a few seconds and &gt;stare before asking politely why the high &gt;elven guards haven't turned me into a fine &gt;pink mist. Those people that ask me about <P>Krescent has been fortunate to gain the notice of a high lvl Dark Elf Shadowknight who has been her mentor in the game, and who has given her several pieces of armor/equipment that has helped her.  When he gets her something new, she takes the older one, and puts it in the bank.  I have given away several pieces of the older equip, plus have given away more magic rings that she's made than she has sold to new players--THAT DON'T BEG.  If they beg--for money or stuff--no matter how much I have on me, I won't give them any.  I will watch them a little, and if they look very needy, I will give them something.  I am not that high of a lvl where I have much stuff to give, but I give what I can to help those starting out--like my mentor did for me. I know.. I know.. how very un-Innoruuk of me. =P <P>------------------<BR>Krescent (K'res) of Third Gate<BR>13th Rank Shadowknight<BR>Teir'Dal <BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 192.251.125.2</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>LOL, okay, something happened last night that had to have been the funniest thing I've heard in a long time.  I was waiting outside Felwithe for a bind, as there was an unofficial guild gathering starting in Mistmoore and I wanted to show up.  Most the people in my guild haven't seen me yet, mainly because I'm so many levels lower than they are, and I tend to get left behind a lot.  Anyways, no one was answering my /shout for a bind, and I just sat there for a few minutes.  Then this low level high elven cleric comes up to me, bows before me, and then stands there waiting for a reply.  I can't see her bow, so I don't do anything.  She then casts some buff on me, I thank whoever did that, and she calls me a traitor.  <P>Okay, I haven't been able to really role play in the longest time, so I jumped on this opportunity.  I explained politely that yes, I am a dark elf, no the guards won't kill me, sorry I didn't see you there, I'm totally blind.  She smiled and ran off, but later I get a tell from her asking how I was made blind.  I told her my history.  She asked if there was a cure.  I said, yes, but she's missing from Felwithe at the moment, she's in Kunark.  She tells me she's sorry she's not powerful enough to go there herself to find whoever can cure my blindness, but she'll help me however she can.<P>That had to be the nicest thing someone's ever said to me *sniffle*.  And then, the funny part.  She comes back to the gate, two minutes later, and suddenly I'm surrounded by a cloud of high elves in apprentice robes.  Newbies of all imaginable randomly generated fantasy names began drilling me on how I got here and "why r u blue?"  None of them asked for anything other than some answers.  Several even commented on how they had heard dark elves were ugly but I was beautiful (and said that when they logged on next time they'd have to start a dark elf of their own  <IMG SRC="http://www.neriak.com/ubb/wink.gif">).  I took it all in stride and said, "thank you...but I wouldn't know."  <P>I have a sneaking suspicion that Tunare reads the posts on this site and threw that at me just to spite me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.39.72.116</font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000009&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000009&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
