<P>
Paineel is a gorgeous evil city... for Erudites that worship Cazic Thule only.  Those who live and work here are not tolerant of any outsiders no matter how blackened their hearts may be, only acts against the High Council in Erudin are likely to win their admiration.
</P>

<P>
We have chosen to list figures that are prominent in the city as well as the vendors that sell goods.  Since this is a city rich in lore and quests, we felt this may be of some use to the anxious traveller.  Keep your invisibility spells handy and a wizard or druid to spell you out in case of attack would be wise as well *chuckles*
</P>

<BR>

<P>
Those vendors that are labelled as selling 'Adventurers Supplies' typically sell rations, bandages, water and other general supplies you may need on your travels.  Those labelled Bartenders generally have every kind of drink available in town, as well as usually selling empty bottles and casks for your own brewing ventures.
</P>
