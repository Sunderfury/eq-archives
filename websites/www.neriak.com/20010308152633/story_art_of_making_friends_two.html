SCENE 3: NORTH FREEPORT, THREE DAYS AGO
</P>

<P>
The next day found me refreshed and confidant. It is quite remarkable 
what an invigorating evening with a Teir'Dal damsel can do for one's 
creative faculties.  I highly recommend it.  Presently, I had myself a scheme 
so cunning you could pin whiskers on it and call it a fox.  Most of the 
morning was spent putting it into practice.  A few aspects were extremely 
difficult to accomplish.   One task in particular was well-nigh impossible, 
but I got it done.  Later that afternoon, I had a leisurely lunch of spiced 
lion steak with a tossed side salad.  The chardonnay was piquant and 
well-suited to the meal.  I then took a small stroll, enjoying the day and 
making sure that my preparations were in place.  They were.  When night fell, 
I would be ready.
</P>

<P>
The meeting was designated to take place at the Jade Tiger at nightfall.  
I was there at least an hour and a half before, drinking at the bar with an 
old friend.  I had known Bracewell for about three years now, a fine sort for 
a half-elf.  The bard spun the best stories, and one could easily spend an 
entire night listening to him.  The poor soul was not in a merry mood this 
evening however; he was in love yet again, with a lady who in all likelihood 
was totally unaware of his existence.  I nodded sympathetically at his tale 
of woe, all the while reminding myself of the dozens of times I had heard 
this same tale and variations thereof from his lips.  Bracewell was never 
happy unless he was suffering from some form of unrequited love.  Terrible as 
it was, it always inspired him to remarkable feats of eloquence.  Ah well, I 
thought.  Whatever sharpens your blade.
</P>

<P>
Young Jasud entered just twenty minutes after Bracewell and I sat down to 
dinner.  He was of medium height for a human, stocky and unlovely in his 
livery as a Knight of Truth.  His movements were arrogant yet furtive, and he 
clenched and unclenched his callused fists several times before striding 
purposely to the bar.  There was a cruelty about him I did not like, a 
haughty superiority around 'lessers' that is the hallmark trait of the 
bully.  Above all, there was a burning in his eyes that made me realize that 
the rumors I had heard about him were accurate: this was a fanatic.  I do not 
care for fanatics of any stripe.  They are a danger to all, including (if not 
especially to) their friends.  I would sooner trust a wounded griffin than 
one such as he.  
</P>

<P>
Young Jasud ordered no wine, nor any alcohol of any sort.  His angry 
glare cut short any comment the barman would have made when he ordered a 
glass of water.  He sipped at it, looking over the residents of the tavern 
for his contact.  His predatory gaze stopped at me for a long, long time.  It 
moved on soon after Bracewell and I got into still another heated argument 
over the merits of Teir'Dal women versus half-elf women.  Young Jasud's eyes 
then lingered at the only other Dark Elf in the hall, an expatriate named 
Dravolt, but desisted when it was clear that the poor man was so deep into 
his cups he could not lift his head from the table at which he slumped, much 
less conspire.  I imagine young Jasud's impatience and frustration had just 
about reached their limits when the human female tapped him on the shoulder.  
I fought back a grin.  The fool had all but jumped.
</P>

<P>
&quot;A pleasant evening Sir Jasud,&quot; she said casually, lifting a mug of beer 
to her lips.  &quot;The night has spread its cooling blanket of sable over the 
sky.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I was gratified to observe young Jasud's mouth drop open as she gave him 
the code phrase. She was fairly unremarkable and blended easily with the rest 
of the clientele.  He took in her ordinary clothing and the presence of a 
dagger at her side, and forced the counterphrase through his now clenched 
teeth.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; he rasped, &quot;Like a gentle mask.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The human smiled and asked quietly, &quot;You have what I seek?&quot;
</P>

<P>
The paladin reached into his jerkin and pulled out the corner to a 
leather document case.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I have it right here.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;May I have it?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You'll have it and more,&quot; he sneered.  &quot;I was expecting a Dark Elf, 
you know.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Many serve Neriak,&quot; she told him quietly.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I suppose,&quot; he conceded, &quot;I just expected better from our kind.&quot;
</P>

<P>
With an ugly smile he threw the contents of his waterglass into the human 
woman's face.  At that obviously prearranged signal, four paladins threw off 
the cloaks they hid themselves in and leaped from the seats in which I had 
previously spotted them, surrounding the woman with blades drawn.  
</P>

<P>
Young Jasud laughed harshly and leveled his sword at her, hissing &quot;You 
are hereby arrested in the name of the Knights of Truth for espionage and 
attempted conspiracy against the sovereign states of Felwithe and Kelethin, 
our allies.  You will be remanded to the Temple of Marr for shriving and 
confinement, pending execution to be carried out tomorrow morning.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Your death,&quot; he gloated, &quot;Will serve as a lesson for the Dark Elf scum 
you serve to take their stinking plots elsewhere and beware the day we take 
our swords to their own throats.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The human woman wiped the water from her eyes and looked at the circle of 
steel surrounding her.  Drawing back to young Jasud, she grinned and winked 
at him.  A flash of light followed, blinding all within the tavern 
temporarily.  When we could focus again, the woman was gone, leaving nothing 
behind but her musical, mocking giggle.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Gated,&quot; one of the paladins snarled.  &quot;The bitch was a spellcaster.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Indeed she was, I laughed inwardly.  A most wondrous spellcaster, my dear 
foolish paladins.  Enoyna  (bless her wits and her steaming carnality) had 
played her part most beautifully.  The moment I had explained my plan to her 
that morning, she had responded by clapping her delicate hands in delight and 
agreeing to it most enthusiastically.  After briefing her about her role, I 
set out to scout the Tavern and establish a little 'insurance' in case my 
suspicions regarding young Jasud were correct.  As he even now turned my way 
with his burning, piggy eyes,  I congratulated myself for thinking so far 
ahead.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You!&quot; he bellowed. &quot;Dark Elf!  You're in this as well!&quot;
</P>

<P>
My friend Bracewell instantly got to his feet in outrage.  Ah, these 
romantics.  May the gods love them.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Here now,&quot; He cried, &quot;How dare you accuse my friend of any wrongdoing?&quot;
</P>

<P>
But young Jasud had already made up his mind.
</P>

<P>
&quot;He's a Dark Elf and a Rogue!  He's part of this, no mistake!&quot;
</P>

<P>
The other paladins slowly began to approach our table, eyes hooded and 
dark.  It was time.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Excuse me, good gentlemen,&quot; I began, rising slowly, my hands empty and 
spread benignly.  &quot;If I am to be accused of something, should I not be 
apprised of what that something is, so I may ascertain whether of not I have 
in fact done this something?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You and your foul people seek to conquer the Faydark Forests, you 
filth,&quot; young Jasud snarled.  &quot;We Knights of Truth set a trap to catch you 
and catch you we did!&quot;  he cackled bloodthirstily.  &quot;Your accomplice may 
have escaped, but you won't!  Seize him!&quot;
</P>

<P>
Bracewell interposed himself between us.  The drama had reached its next 
peak; my cue had arrived and I had better take it before my well-meaning bard 
friend found himself subjected to expensive healing spells at the local 
hospital.
</P>

<P>
&quot;My dear paladins,&quot; I began.  &quot;Before you clap me in irons or worse, 
will you hear me?  The accusations you level against me are serious and I 
wish to respond to them.  You are the Knights of Truth, not shadowknights.  
Therefore the truth must have some meaning to you.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Sir Breel lowered his sword.  Of all the paladins in North Freeport, I 
reluctantly admired this one.  His word was his bond, he treated others with 
kindness and courtesy, and he actually had a working brain in his head.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I will hear what you have to say,&quot; he said in his deep bass voice.  
</P>

<P>
Young Jasud looked outraged, but he was clearly outranked by the older Knight.
</P>

<P>
I bowed.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Thank you, Sir Breel,&quot; I intoned.  I cast a long, telling look at the 
paladins and the patrons who had not left when the rumpus had begun.  &quot;You 
all know me,&quot; I began quietly. &quot;I am a Teir'Dal by blood, and a Rogue by 
profession.  That much is true.  The rest, I fear, is folly.  To associate 
guilt with my race is ridiculous.  If that is the case, then every last one 
of you is damned for every evil the Freeport Militia has done, since they are 
made up of humans like yourself.  To condemn me for my profession is equally 
fell.  Does every Paladin of Marr know precisely what his or her guildmaster 
does or thinks, or at what secret tasks the other paladins are assigned?  I 
think not.  I have come to North Freeport many times over the years, always 
under flag of neutrality.  I have never burgled, pickpocketed or engaged in 
any form of confidence trickery at any time.  Indeed, I have often served you 
and the citizenry on several occasions.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I paused at looked down at my empty, long-fingered hands.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You know that by the color of my skin and by my trade I am shunned 
throughout most of Norrath,&quot; I continued gently.  &quot;Welcome only in my own 
city or that of the Trolls and Ogres to the South.  I have never visited the 
South.  Freeport, therefore, is my only refuge outside of Neriak from the 
harsh world in which I must make my living.  I am no hate-worshipper.  I 
would not jeopardize the trust I have worked so hard to build, nor lose the 
friends I have here for my Guild.  I am a rogue, gentleman, free to take or 
reject assignments at will.  Free to live my life as I see fit.  And I chose 
a long time ago not to bring harm my second home.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Bravo,&quot; Bracewell cried, applauding vigorously.  Young Jasud glared at 
me with naked murder in his eyes, but the others were nodding slowly.  I had 
them.  Now to slit the throat.
</P>

<P>
&quot;If accusations are to be leveled at me, I reject them and ask for actual 
evidence against me,&quot; I continued.  I locked gazes with young Jasud and set 
my jaw purposely.  &quot;I also respectfully suggest that it would be in the best 
interest of you and the Order you serve to examine more closely the verity of 
my accuser.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Young Jasud purpled.  Sir Breel turned to me, face darkening.
</P>

<P>
&quot;What exactly do you mean by that statement, Szardos?&quot; he inquired 
dangerously.
</P>

<P>
Not taking my eyes off young Jasud, I calmly replied, &quot;I have heard 
rumors regarding this one.  Ugly rumors.&quot;
</P>

<P>
It took two paladins to restrain young Jasud from leaping upon unarmed 
little me with his nasty sharp sword.  Strong fellows, these paladins.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You will tell me these rumors, Szardos,&quot; Sir Breel demanded.
</P>

<P>
I proceeded to relate all the rumors I had heard from the townsfolk 
yesterday regarding their dislike and cautions about young Jasud and gave Sir 
Breel their names.  Questioning them would provide the Knights with the same 
information and would only serve to blacken young Jasud and cleanse mine own 
reputation.  I paused for effect, and then launched the killing blow.
</P>

<P>
&quot;There is another matter,&quot; I whispered, &quot;but one I will not disclose in 
public.&quot;
</P>

<P>
They leaped upon that statement like fish to a wriggling lure.  The 
patrons, drunk and sober, were all ordered to leave the Tavern at once.  On 
his way out, Bracewell gave me the handsign that meant 'you will tell me what 
this was all about later?'  I gave him a barely visible nod.  He threw me a 
cheerful wink and left with the others.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Now, then,&quot; Sir Breel declared, &quot;What is this other matter?&quot;
</P>

<P>
I sighed with remorse.
</P>

<P>
&quot;This is as close as I shall ever come to betraying my Guild, Sir 
Knight,&quot; I told him carefully, &quot;So respect my courage and my confidence.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Sir Breel nodded gravely.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Approximately two months or so ago, I overheard Elder N'Mar of the Mask 
talking with a courier about a new 'advantage' he had gained in North 
Freeport.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Several of the paladins growled audibly.  They knew of N'Mar, and that he 
was the guildsman in charge of Ebon Mask operations in Freeport.  Theirs was 
a frustrated hatred, as N'Mar has never left Neriak since he was two and 
thirty, preferring to work his schemes through subordinates and informers.
</P>

<P>
&quot;The 'advantage' he spoke of was a new ally he had gained.  A Knight of 
Truth he had subverted.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;LIAR!&quot; Jasud screamed.  &quot;You seek to divert suspicion away from 
yourself by condemning me falsely!&quot;
</P>

<P>
I regarded him sadly.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Do you think it easy for me to share information from my Guild with you, 
Sir Knight?  I do what I do reluctantly, torn between conflicting loyalties.  
In truth I have no evidence for these rumors.  That N'Mar has been using you 
and paying you for the past two months is only heresay.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Sir Breel stared at both of us: me, calm and steady; young Jasud, panting 
and swearing.  The next few moments were delicate indeed.  His reaction would 
make or break me.
</P>

<P>
&quot;There must be proof!&quot; he roared.  &quot;One of you must provide proof 
against the other, else we are doomed to live in suspicion of you both tor 
the rest of our days!&quot;
</P>

<P>
Young Jasud was thunderstruck.  &quot;You would take the word of this Dark Elf 
trash over me?  I am your brother in arms!&quot;
</P>

<P>
Sir Breel gave him a hard look and said the words I was waiting for him 
to voice aloud.
</P>

<P>
&quot;So was Lucan.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Sir Breel,&quot; I interrupted softly, ever the helpful gallant. &quot;I have 
nothing to hide.  My room at Tassel's Tavern and my person are at your 
disposal to search to your satisfaction.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You have nothing more to add, Szardos?&quot; he inquired.
</P>

<P>
I drew my brows together in concentration.
</P>

<P>
&quot;No, Sir Knight, nothing.  Except ... well, I know not if it is 
important, but I do recall something else N'Mar said that evening.  Something 
along the lines of his informer having a tapestry more valuable than any 
would realize.  I don't know what that could mean or whether it is important.&quot;
</P>

<P>
One the paladins restraining young Jasud looked up in alarm.  Turning to 
his charge he said, &quot;You have a tapestry in your quarters, do you not?  I 
have seen it.&quot;
</P>

<P>
As young Jasud looked on in horror, Sir Breel turned to another Knight 
and ordered him to arrange for searches of our rooms and belongings and to 
question the people I had named.  They left quickly, a grim set to their 
lips.  I gave my weapons to Sir Breel, and permitted him to search me.  He 
found nothing, of course (I had left all of my usual surprises back in my 
room and had destroyed the battered militia helmet early this morning).  
After much argument, young Jasud did the same.  Then we all sat down to wait.
</P>

<P>
An hour later, the paladins returned with barely suppressed rage 
smoldering in their faces.  One of them came forward and slapped a slim 
leather packet onto the table before Sir Breel.  &quot;The citizenry confirm 
Szardos' statements,&quot; he barked.  &quot;And I found this,&quot; he went on, his voice 
replete with disgust, &quot;behind the tapestry in Jasud's room.&quot; Sir Breel's
hands were steady as he opened the packet.  Inside he found a pouch with 
twenty gold pieces padded with cloth to prevent clinking and a letter.  The 
letter was a note of congratulations and thanks for information leading to 
the death of Mojax Hikspin, a Knight of Truth stationed in the West 
Commonlands.  The letter was signed by N'Mar of the Ebon Mask and dated last 
month, a sevenday after Hikspin's death.
</P>

<P>
We now had our 'bloody dagger.'
