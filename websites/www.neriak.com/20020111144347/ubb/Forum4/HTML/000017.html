</FONT><HR>(I guess Darkmoon isn't the only one who uses strong arm tactics. Since one likes to make a statement, then ask a question and not allow someone to answer, I'll address it here. For those who missed the rest of the conversation, here you go: <A HREF="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fvelnarindphilithfrm4.showMessage?topicID=29.topic" TARGET=_blank>http://pub73.ezboard.com/fvelnarindphilithfrm4.showMessage?topicID=29.topic</A>) <P>How quickly we slide the slippery slope.<P><I>"Myrmandaemus has a problem with some of our members, and even with <B>Velnarin d'Philith as a whole.</B>"</I><P>As I recall, I specifically stated in the post in question, that I had nothing against Velnarin itself, only certain members. Indeed, that because of the paucity of time spent in the company of the majority of Velnarin members, that I was not even in a position to judge either RP or gaming style. Perhaps Moander, you should read before you delete.<P><I>"Basically, a summary of that entire thread would be how we were trying to distinguish ourselves from Darkmoon."</I><P>My mistake. I was under the impression that Sevok started this post to discuss DE roleplaying. I simply wished to point out that since he made the post, Darkmoon as DE roleplayers had changed and grown. I also decided to point out the problem I had with some individuals who crossed certain lines I didn't think were necessary.<P>*GASP* and lo and behold:<P><I>"This is a game, the lines of your IC and OOC are muddied." </I><P>This is rich. This is exactly what I was speaking to regarding the individuals I spoke of. These few individuals I take issue with are known for crossing this line and did so before they were Velnarin and continue to do so now. Take heed Moander, it wasn't I who muddied these waters.<P>If you made this statement regarding my post, let me make it crystal clear for you. That post was ooc, 100%.<P>If you weren't making that statement regarding the post, then which in-game encounter that you participated in with me are you referring to? I question this only because you and I haven't roleplayed together since Velnarin began.<P>I however, have been involved in several encounters with certain individuals where their statements most assuredly muddied these waters beyond recognition and was witnessed by more than just me alone (not Darkmoon members either).<P>The only thing I can hope is that this is not acceptable behavior in Velnarin and that these individuals were doing what they've shown themselves capable of prior to joining Velnarin; showing no respect for spoken or written charter or guidelines. Again, I only have encounters with these few individuals to judge by, so I refrain from judgement of Velnarin on the whole.<P><I>"You did exactly as I expected; indeed, even what I told others to watch for."</I> <P>I still stand by this statment. After watching the flames that Sevok endured for his own well stated opinion regarding Dark Elf roleplay, I knew what I would be facing with my own opinion.<P>Once again, for the record, as I stated in my original post and here in so many ways. I do not have anything against Velnarin. I have nothing against you personally. <P>I do question whether as a leader, you assess the behavior of the individuals in your guild for proper rp etiquette, but this is just a question and an opinion, not a judgement. <P>I do also still have antagonistic feelings towards the individuals of which I speak because of their continued pursuit of "muddying the waters" and other unacceptable behavior which is not just limited to my opinion personally, but is the opinion of many, MANY others who have had any dealings with these people.<P>And even though once again I will point out that at no time have I spoken directly against Velnarin, either in this post, or the previous one, I would like to take the time to thank you Saver, for your comments about Darkmoon, both in this post and the previous post. You make my point for me.<P>(btw: I just noticed this ended up posted on your board after I e-mailed the link to a few friends. I did not request that and do not know who did it as I don't recognize the account as a character name I know)<P>[This message has been edited by Myrmandaemus (edited August 23, 2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Myrmandaemus (edited August 23, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 198.51.174.14</font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000017&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.neriak.com/cgi-bin/cgi-ubb/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000017&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
