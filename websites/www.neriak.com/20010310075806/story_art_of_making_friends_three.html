SCENE 3: NORTH FREEPORT, THREE DAYS AGO (Continued)
</P>

<P>
Sir Breel stood up and turned stonily towards a sweating, gibbering young 
Jasud.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You are under arrest for the vile crimes of oathbreaking and conspiracy 
against the Knights of Truth.  You will be removed to the Temple of Marr for 
confinement and shriving, pending execution in the morning.  May Marr have 
mercy upon your wretched soul.&quot;
</P>

<P>
With an inhuman screech, young Jasud broke free of the paladins 
restraining him.  A leap took him to his sword, which he brandished 
threateningly.
</P>

<P>
&quot;IT'S A LIE!&quot; He howled piteously, &quot;A LIE, A LIE, A LIE!&quot;
</P>

<P>
He actually wounded two Knights before they came at him as one in 
righteous fury.  Self-preservation won out, and he tore out of the tavern in 
a mad run, a squadron of paladins at his heels.  He was a dead man now, here 
and in all of Freeport, for the militia would kill him just as vigorously.  
If he managed to escape his pursuers, he would run to the Commonlands for 
safety.  That is where I would seek him. For this was not over.
</P>

<P>
I gathered up my weapons and stopped before Sir Breel, who had removed 
his helmet and had his face in his hands, weeping softly.  Poor, noble man.  
He deserved better than this.  I touched him gently on the shoulder.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I am sorry,&quot; I said, meaning it. 
</P>

<P>
He exhaled slowly and stood, wiping the tears from his weary eyes and 
running a hand through his graying hair.  All at once he was himself again.  
Proud and straight he stood before me, once more an exemplary bastion of true 
honor.  If they were all like, him, I thought, I would be out of business.  
Not for the obvious reasons, but because I probably would not have the heart 
to confusticate people like him.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You are best without such as he, Noble Sir,&quot; I confessed gently.  &quot;He 
would poison your souls and blacken your names.  You would lose your Way, 
with such ilk to guide you.&quot;
</P>

<P>
He nodded slowly.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Of that I have little doubt.  He is damned to us now and he will be 
brought to justice.  Know that I am not entirely convinced of your innocence 
in all of this, Szardos, but I have no evidence to set against you.  I think 
it wise that you leave North Freeport before the dawn, and that you refrain 
from returning for at least a month.  It will take that long for my Order to 
recover and return to normal operations.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I bowed low and respectfully.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You wish is my will, Sir Breel.&quot;
</P>

<P>

<P>
SCENE 4: THE EAST COMMONLANDS, TWO DAYS AGO
</P>

<P>
N'Mar had better pay me a bloody big bonus for this miserable assignment.
</P>

<P>
Young Jasud had indeed escaped to the Commonlands, as I thought he would. 
Fanatics always have the strength to overcome terrible odds.  Eight 
warriors, paladins and militiamen alike, had felt the sting of his blade in 
his crazed dash to freedom.  It was said that young Jasud had not emerged 
unscathed himself.  Hope springs eternal.
</P>

<P>
If you are curious as to how such damning evidence came to be in young 
Jasud's private quarters at the Temple of Marr, permit me to enlighten you: 
that morning before our rendezvous, I myself forged the letter from N'Mar 
(his rather childish scrawl is particularly easy to duplicate), with 
information I had heard some time ago from the Ebon Mask assassin would had 
actually killed the Knight Vikspin.  This I placed into the slim packet, 
along with the 10 gold pieces (a loan from Enoyna; I was to pay her back as 
soon as it was convenient ... or else she was willing to 'take it in trade.' 
Dear Enoyna.) in order to complete the illusion of young Jasud's treachery.  
As for secreting it within his quarters, well.  If you have never executed a 
breaking and entering into the Temple of Marr, I certainly will not make it 
easy for you so to do by telling you how I did it.  I will merely say that 
Bristlebane himself must have blessed my stealth that extremely tense 
afternoon, as I snuck past the guards and priests on duty and reached young 
Jasud's private room.  Did you know that the fools actually have their names 
emblazoned on the doors there? The lock, I need not tell you, was a joke.  
Very trusting fellows, these paladins.  Once in, I chose a tapestry that 
looked as if it had not been touched in years.  The rest you know. 
</P>

<P>
Once I left Freeport, I set out to track this double agent paladin 
bastard in the Commonlands.  Why?  Two reasons.  One, the papers he still 
carried for the rendezvous might have been genuine.  I had to be sure of 
this.  As for the second reason, I felt I owed it to the honor of the Knights 
of Truth to rid them of this blackhead on their pristine surface.  Be silent, 
all of you.  I am still as treacherous as ever.  I just have certain 
standards to maintain, that is all.
</P>

<P>
I found young Jasud a day and three-quarters later, shortly after dusk.  
He was shivering at a makeshift fire, his bloody sword on the ground beside 
him.  The infection of madness was evident in his excited mumblings and his 
twitching movements.  It would be a mercy to send him to the conspirator's 
reward.  Silent as I was, he heard me approach.  The lunacy had provided him 
with preternatural senses, a survival mechanism which has been well 
documented by the scholars.  His hatred of me cut as deeply as a razor as he 
shuddered with anger.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You,&quot; he acknowledged in a wavering, ill-controlled voice. &quot;Do you know 
what you have cost me?&quot;
</P>

<P>
I shrugged.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Nothing whatsoever,&quot; I countered calmly.  &quot;You threw it all away 
yourself.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Filthy liar.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; I insisted.  &quot;You strove by your own actions to ruin the 
Knights of Truth, young Jasud.  They serve the Good as valiant and true 
warriors of Light.  Treachery and espionage are my business, not theirs.  I 
could simply tell you that crass amateurs such as you insult the dignity of 
professionals such as myself.  It would even be the truth.  But the greater 
truth is that people such as you would set your Order on a path that would 
destroy them from within.  Where honor is concerned, the end does not justify 
the means.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Besides,&quot; I said wryly, &quot;As much trouble as they are to me and mine, I 
am rather fond of your Order as it is.  I have enough competiton in the 
shadows from other rogues.  I do not need any more.&quot;
</P>

<P>
He stood, trembling with venom, and lifted his gore-spattered sword at me.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, Dark Elf scum,&quot; he growled at me.  
&quot;All you say only proves that my cause is just.  Ridding all of Norrath of 
blue-skinned trash such as you.  That was worth bending a precious rule or 
two.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I am curious,&quot; I said honestly.  &quot;Why do you hate us so?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You are Dark Elves,&quot; he spat.  &quot;Our enemy.  Secretive, impure threats 
to human rule.  You must die.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;So it all comes down to bigotry,&quot; I mused, shaking my head.  &quot;I suppose 
the Trolls would be next.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;YES! YES!&quot; he shouted, scattering frightened birds from the area.  
&quot;Then the lumbering Ogres.  All who threaten humanity must be eliminated.  
You understand this.  That is why you must die.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;And the other races?&quot; I inquired politely.  &quot;What, for example, of the 
halflings and the half-elves?&quot;
</P>

<P>
Young Jasud's lips curled into an ugly sneer.
</P>

<P>
&quot;The halflings are too small and weak to bother us.  As for the mongrels, 
they are not against us.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;If they were to be against you?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Then they die as well.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I drew my weapons and did not bother to salute him.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You are insane.  I do Norrath a favor by removing you from it.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The blast of a warcry drew our attention as we crossed swords.  An orc 
legionnaire and two centurions burst from the thickness of the trees.  They 
were running full at us with all the speed they could muster, destruction on 
their tiny, vicious minds.  I shot a glance at young Jasud.  Surprisingly, he 
was lucid enough to understand and silently agree.  
</P>

<P>
This threat comes first.  We will finish this later.
</P>

<P>
A single sweep of young Jasud's heavy blade disarmed the legionnaire, 
sending his rusted scimitar into the bushes. Taking advantage of the beast's 
surprise, we both attacked the centurion with which it arrived.  I struck at 
it from behind, burying the razored points of my rapier and dragoon dirk into 
its back, as young Jasud decapitated it with a frenzied swing of his sword.  
Crazed or not, young Jasud was a Knight, and a fell warrior.  The second 
centurion was clubbed aside by the angered legionnaire, who had regained the 
scimitar.  The hapless centurion was unconscious ere it hit the ground.  The 
legionnaire then turned its attention to young Jasud, slamming a muscled fist 
into his side.  I heard the ugly sound of ribs splintering and snapping and 
something far more ominous, as the orc drove young Jasud to his knees.  It 
lifted its awful weapon to finish him off, but I was faster.  Again I plunged 
the deadly tips of my weapons into an unprotected back.  The legionnaire 
howled in fury and pain, turning to me with tusks bared and dripping pinkish 
foam.
</P>

<P>
Several times was I struck, and several times did I strike back.  The 
legionnaire was winning this fight, however, as I was rapidly running out of 
breath and forcing bruised and battered limbs to parry and thrust and praying 
quite dearly that the blood soaking my armor was not all mine.  To his credit 
and undoing, young Jasud struck the legionnaire once more, cutting his hand 
off at the wrist.  Roaring in rage, the legionnaire took him by the throat 
with its remaining hand and broke his neck with single squeeze of its 
powerful fingers.  It tuned to me, a hideous grin on its animal features.  
But the sound of that awful crack had galvanized me, and before it could 
move, I threw myself at it with all my might, the full force of my charge 
behind the dragoon dirk which I drove unerringly up into its jaw and beyond 
to pierce what the orc laughingly called its brain.  The lights dimmed in its 
tiny eyes and it fell alongside the man it had killed.  Rest, young Jasud.  
You were a disgrace in life, but a worthy Knight in death.  There are worse 
epitaphs.
</P>

<P>
The grunts behind me told me that the danger was not quite over.  The 
second (and last) centurion had awakened and was even now advancing on me to 
avenge its brothers.  I took some solace in the fact that, despite my 
weakened condition, it would be a much easier foe to dispatch than its 
leader.  Moreover, once it was killed, I would suffer no further trouble and 
could depart in peace and safety.   
</P>

<P>
**********************************
</P>

<P>
SCENE 5: THE EAST COMMONLANDS, RIGHT NOW
</P>

<P>
Perhaps they'll put that wretched sentence upon my wretched tombstone.
</P>

<P>
An orc legionnaire and pair of centurions are one thing.  But an orc 
legionnaire and pair of centurions followed immediately by a bloody young 
kodiak bear is another matter entirely.  I know not whether you have ever 
encountered kodiak bears.  The best way to describe them is to take muscle, 
fur, fangs and claws and wrap them into a large and bad tempered mass.  Fit 
and rested, I could take this one facing me with but moderate effort.  My 
instant condition, however, precluded any thought of success whatsoever.  
Perhaps because I knew my cause to be hopeless, I felt my lips curl into the 
mocking smile that has ever graced my features in the face of the longest 
odds and most insurmountable dangers.  The bracing flow of adrenalin within 
my sinews assured me that I would go down fighting, my wounds in front.
</P>

<P>
As a gentleman and rogue of Neriak, I could do no less.
</P>

<P>
I dodged four blows from the roaring beast, plinking at it here and 
there, as a mosquito would fight against a shadow wolf.  My much-vaunted luck 
held for two more swipes of its razored claws.  The third caught me in the 
face.  Two more savaged my body, sending me tumbling headlong into the trunk 
of a tree.  Amazingly, I was still nimble enough to twist in mid air.  When I 
crashed into the tree, I landed on my feet, weapons in hand.  It took the 
last of my reserves so to do.  The mad rush of adrenalin had left me, lacing 
my tortured muscled with lead.  My right arm would not respond to my mental 
commands.  Indeed, I marvelled that it was still attached to the bloodsoaked 
shreds of my shoulder.  The great beast approached me, great gobbets of drool 
dripping from its snarling fangs.  Braced against the tree, rapier wavering 
unsteadily in my trembling left hand, I awaited it.  The kodiak lifted a 
mighty paw, its terrible claws stained proudly with the precious scarlet of 
my blood. Gazing into its murderous amber eyes, I saw my death.  My smile 
widened.
</P>

<P>
Bristlebane, I come to you now.  Have a drink ready for me, you tricky 
bastard.
</P>

<P>
Fire suddenly filled the air, enveloping the kodiak, who bellowed with 
rage and agony.  A club the size of an adult wood elf lifted skyward behind 
it, arcing downwards to crunch meaningfully into its back.  Crippled and 
angry, the beast turned to its new opponent, who continued to flail and pound 
the bear into pulp.  I never heard an aria so sweet as the piteous whine the 
kodiak let fly before its skull was shattered under the weight of that club. 
</P>

<P>
My vision was already fading as my rescuer let fly a deafening roar of 
triumph, painful to the ear, but as delicious to me as the death cry of the 
kodiak.  I discerned that he came near to me, but I could only see a huge 
outline, dark and blurred with the effects of my delirium.  A moist, 
shattering spasm deep within my chest told me I would have no breath with 
which to force my dried lips to thank my club-wielding friend for my murder's 
revenge.  A pity.  I do so like to give credit where credit is due.  I 
perceived that he was gesturing at me.
</P>

<P>
Then everything went black.
</P>

<P>
A force akin to lightning coursed into the ruins of my body, and I felt 
it jerk and jump with the waves of pleasure-pain that is indicative of 
magickal healing.  I felt my very cells regenerate, felt the muscles growing 
back, felt the tendons and ligaments reknitting  themselves, as if thousands 
of tiny spiders within me spun webs of flesh and sinew.  Several times did 
that huge figure gesture at me, and several times did I feel that blessed 
energy flow into my very atoms.  It preserved me.  It restored me.  When it 
was over, I felt as if I had been pounded flat and remolded into my original 
form by giant hands.  Aching and light-headed with the pain of the massive 
healing session, I lifted my head and opened sweat-ringed eyes to view the 
face of my savior.
</P>

<P>
Yikes.
</P>

<P>
The massive, misshapen face I looked up at belonged to a very, very large 
Ogre.  The tiny, glassy eyes that peered at me underneath the shade of his 
beetling brow were of different colors: one blue, one green.  His crooked 
nose looked as if it had itself seen the wrong end of his club more than 
once.  The gaping maw that was his mouth was filled with huge tusklike teeth, 
sharp and uneven.  Looming over me like the shadow of a mountain, he grinned 
hugely at me.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Hullo, Inkie!&quot;  he bellowed at me.  &quot;You be Oopz' Frend?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Er, all right.&quot;  I answered warily.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You gud Inkie!&quot;  he boomed.  &quot;Nice Inkie! Oopz call you 'George'!&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;'George'&quot;  I asked.
</P>

<P>
The behemoth bobbed his head up and down excitedly.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Well,&quot; I stammered, &quot;That's ...  certainly very nice.  But my name is 
Szardos.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;'George.'&quot; he insisted.
</P>

<P>
&quot;'Szardos.'&quot; I replied.
</P>

<P>
&quot;'George.'&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;'Szardos.'&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;'George.'&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;'George?'&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;George.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I sighed.  One in my position should never argue with a grinning hilltop 
carrying a large club.
</P>

<P>
&quot;'George' it is, then.&quot;  I told him, with gritted teeth.
</P>

<P>
Oopz beamed with pleasure.
</P>

<P>
&quot;HULLO, GEORGE!&quot;  he cried happily.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Indeed.&quot;  I mumbled weakly.
</P>

<P>
I gave Oopz the honor of stripping the orcs of their weapons and armor, 
while I relieved the broken body of what had once been young Jasud of his 
documents.  Glancing at them briefly, I noted that they consisted of 
correspondence between the Guildmaster of North Freeport and the King of 
Felwithe.  Genuine or false, they would be of worth to N'Mar.  I put them 
inside what remained of my tunic for safekeeping, making a mental note to 
charge N'Mar double my fee for this awful assignment.  I had not entirely 
lied to Sir Breel in North Freeport.  I constantly avoided any assignments 
that would jeopardize my position in any part of Freeport.  This was my first 
and my last venture along those lines.  Never again would I risk losing the 
ability to enjoy the vibrant, cosmopolitan humors of my adopted city.  Not, I 
grinned inwardly, when there were numerous other cities to steal blind.
</P>

<P>
The pair of us made camp later that evening, not far from our 
battlefield.  The kodiak's pelt was worthless, but his meat was not.  Roasted 
with a few spices on the portable spit I had in my pack, it turned out to be 
fairly tasty, and plentiful enough to fill both of our bellies.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Yum!&quot;  Oopz rumbled contentedly.  &quot;George make-um gud bear steak, 
George does.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Thank you, Oopz,&quot; I said.  &quot;Oopz.  That is a rather ... unusual name.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Oopz bobbed his massive head up and down in agreement and bent low to 
warm his hands at the fire.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Very strange name, yes.  Shamenz name Oopz wen Oopz wuz li'l baby ogre. 
Shamenz allus name new baby ogres.  Oopz special.  Wen Oopz born, star come 
down frum sky.  Dis important.  Shamenz, he come to cave to look at li'l baby 
me.  He tickle me and tell Mumz and Dadz dat me be powurful shamenz one day.  
Den he lift me to sky to name me and dere was big thunder and he name me ... 
right after he drop me.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You're joking,&quot; I blurted out without thinking.
</P>

<P>
Oopz grinned.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I wish I was.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I shook my head in disbelief.  Then I narrowed my eyebrows as I suddenly 
realized something.
</P>

<P>
&quot;It must be rather tiring pretending to be feeble-minded all the time, eh 
Oopz?&quot;
</P>

<P>
Oopz shot a glance at me, his eyes suddenly very sharp and extremely wary.
</P>

<P>
&quot;What George say?&quot;  he asked innocently.
</P>

<P>
I rolled my eyes.  &quot;George wonder why Oopz talks like Oopz talk,&quot; I 
parroted, &quot;Especially when Oopz just said 'I wish I was', and not 'me wish 
me wuz,' or something similarly moronic like that.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I stood up.
</P>

<P>
&quot;A tiny slip,&quot; I admitted, &quot;But one that tells me that Oopz is much more 
intelligent than Oopz lets on.&quot;
</P>

<P>
A slow nod and a grudging smile followed from Oopz.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You're quick, Dark Elf,&quot; said he finally.  &quot;Quicker than most.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Most gracious.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Not at all.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;So why the charade, Shaman?&quot;
</P>

<P>
Oopz leaned back and spread his arms.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Look at me, Dark Elf.  Look closely at me from the perspective of almost 
any race on Norrath.&quot;  He put his fist dramatically under his chin.  &quot;Do you 
see a scholar?&quot; Oopz asked.  He then let his jaw go slack, and his eyes go 
wide and glassy.  &quot;Or do you see a large, clumsy, but altogether dangerous 
oaf with magical powers?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I stand shamed for my prejudices,&quot; I confessed.  &quot;But why indulge in 
playing the fool at all, then?&quot;
</P>

<P>
Oopz cocked his head to the side, regarding me thoughtfully.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You tell me,&quot; he said.
</P>

<P>
I considered.  The constant intrigues that have been my life provided me 
with the answer to my question almost immediately.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;As a fool you are tolerated,&quot; I told him slowly.  &quot;Perhaps even liked.  
People tend to speak more freely if they perceive that you are no threat.  By 
pretending ignorance, by feigning that you cannot understand their 
subtleties, you lull the suspicious.  As a fool you are less threatening, and 
predictable ... from their point of view.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Oopz replied.  &quot;I said you were quick.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;It must be difficult,&quot; I mused.
</P>

<P>
&quot;You have never disguised yourself, Rogue?&quot; He asked mockingly. &quot;You 
have never pretended to be other than who you are?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Of course,&quot; I countered, smiling.  &quot;But never all the time.  How 
draining it must be.&quot;
</P>

<P>
He scratched the back of his broad and hairy neck.
</P>

<P>
&quot;It is, sometimes.  Damn, but you would never have guessed my secret if 
it wasn't for that slip.  May the Warlord curse that idiot shaman for naming 
me that name!  Even today, I could roast him alive for that.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Can you not change it?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;No,&quot; he said unhappily . &quot;Names have power, especially among my people. 
I am stuck with it.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;My condolences.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Phaugh,&quot; he muttered gruffly, waving a ham-sized hand away in dismissal.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Well, I am nonetheless glad to make your acquaintance, Noble Shaman, 
especially when a certain kodiak was proving somewhat intent on providing his 
cubs with a Teir'Dal rug for their cave.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Oopz chuckled.  Or, rather, I took it to be a chuckle.  In truth, it 
sounded remarkably like two large boulders grinding against one another.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;You fought well,&quot;  he told me, &quot;Even at the end, you still stood 
against it in defiance.  The bear could have killed you, Dark Elf, but it 
would never have beaten you.  By the Warlord, I could not let such a fighter 
die.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Most kind,&quot; I said.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Phaugh,&quot; he replied.
</P>

<P>
My natural curiosity again welled within me about my large companion.
</P>

<P>
&quot;What exactly are you doing in the Commonlands, Oopz?  I rarely see your 
people in this area.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Oopz lifted his chin.  &quot;I travel in service to my people and to the 
Warlord.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I'm afraid I don't understand.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Oopz glowered at me, his mismatched eyes sad and distant.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Ogres were a power once,&quot; he rumbled.  &quot;We ruled through our great 
strength and cunning.  No race could stand against our might.  The Warlord 
loved us and spoke to us often, as I speak to you now.  We enjoyed his favor 
and his counsel.  The other gods became jealous of our place.  They united 
the other races and set them upon us.  We laughed at their interference, and 
sent the other races to flight.  Then we challenged the gods themselves.  We 
lost.  Our beloved Warlord himself came to our side, and together we brought 
war to the gods once more.  The battle shook the earth and rent the heavens, 
but again we were defeated.  The gods captured the Warlord and imprisoned him 
in his Plane of Power, sealing him away from Norrath forever.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I have read the histories,&quot; I said.  &quot;The Teir'Dal chronicled the 
banishment of Rallos Zek.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Oopz looked impressed.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Know you what happened afterwards, Dark Elf?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Not entirely,&quot; I confessed.  &quot;The accounts thereafter are somewhat 
sketchy.&quot;
</P>

<P>
A sigh like steam hissing from a teapot came from my ponderous comrade.  
&quot;My people were beaten, and we were scattered across Norrath,&quot; he said 
grimly, &quot;Strong we remained, but knowledge was taken from us.  We were made 
weak in mind, to keep us from rising again.  Confused, we began to fight with 
one another over petty things.  And the Warlord was now gone from us.  So my 
people wandered, one group searching for a home where we would be safe.  A 
strong home to protect us from our enemies until we could rebuild ourselves.&quot;
He grinned me a toothy, lopsided grin.  &quot;This we made in Ogguk.  Guarded on 
all sides it was.  Rivers to block invasion, a desert to be avoided, jagged 
mountains to guard our backs, and a thick jungle to slow down armies.  It was 
the perfect new home.  We carved a city for ourselves from the country's
tough bones, and called it Oggok, which in Ogre means Revenge.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;And have you rebuilt yourselves?&quot; I asked.
</P>

<P>
He slowly shook his massive head.
</P>

<P>
&quot;That will take time.  Many, many hundred-years have passed.  Most Ogres 
are still weak in mind.  And the Warlord speaks to us only in our dreams and 
in battle.  Still, though Smart Ogres are slow to come, come they do.  We 
teach them our past, and how we must improve our people so we can regain our 
place on Norrath.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;And some, like you, go forth to learn?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Yes.  I go traveling the world to find knowledge that will help my 
people.  And to fight.&quot;  He pointed a meaty finger at our battlefield, at the 
naked bodies strewn about like stringless marionettes, stiffening now amid 
the iron tang of Death. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Do you see this place, Dark Elf?&quot; He asked me.
</P>

<P>
I nodded.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Only here am I alive,&quot; he said quietly.  &quot;Everything else is shadow.  
Or sleep.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Much as I myself am only truly alive in the midst of risk-laden plots and 
in the most dangerous of assignments, I thought to myself.  There is symmetry 
there.  I looked up at his misshapen, almost wistful face.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I believe I understand, Oopz.  I truly do.&quot;
</P>

<P>

<P>
EPILOGUE
</P>

<P>
The next day, we were on our way to Neriak.  I to collect my fee (and 
perhaps a pound of flesh) from N'Mar, Oopz to visit the city proper and the 
Ogres in the Foreign Quarter.  The silence of our journey was eventually 
broken by a brief, yet particularly pungent curse coming from my large 
companion.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Problem?&quot; I inquired.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I could use a drink, Dark Elf.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;It's an hour to the nearest inn,&quot; I reminded him.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Phaugh,&quot; said he in reply.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Half a moment,&quot; I told him, &quot;If you're feeling daring, I've a bottle 
of homemade bog juice with me.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Didn't know you were a brewer, too,&quot; Oopz grunted.
</P>

<P>
I shrugged.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Strictly as an amateur, Oopz.  I only started two weeks or so ago.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Unslinging my pack, I located the pale green bottle, wrapped in furs to 
protect it from breaking.  I placed it in his meaty paw.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Here you are,&quot; I said.
</P>

<P>
Oopz gazed at the bottle with a baleful eye, then threw his head back and 
chugged down its contents in two large gulps.  I watched his eyes widen in 
surprise, and cringed visibly at the soggy bellow of a belch that followed.  
We would in all likelihood not be bothered for the remainder of our trek, I 
thought, for a noise like that would in all probability have sent any animals 
within range to stampede as far away from the source as possible.
</P>

<P>
&quot;So,&quot; I asked.  &quot;Any comments?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;This is pretty much the worst stuff I have ever had in all of my days, 
friend Szardos,&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Really.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;It tastes like the Feerot River,&quot; Oopz said.  He licked his thick lips. 
&quot;With a dead body in it.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Ah,&quot; I replied.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Got any more?&quot;
</P>

<P>
Grinning, I bent down to fish out the other bottle. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;By the way, friend Oopz,&quot; I ventured, &quot;May I ask you a question?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Of course, friend Szardos.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Why the 'George' nonsense?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Oh, I just like the name.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Ah.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Sometimes the answers are simple.<BR>
Life is funny that way.
</P>
