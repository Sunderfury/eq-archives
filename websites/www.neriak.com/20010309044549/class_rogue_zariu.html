A guide to Rogues...
</P>

<P>
First, before you make a rogue, you have to decide if the class is a good match for you.
</P>

<P>
Some facts:
</P>

<P>
We do a lot of melee damage, and I have outdamaged nicely equipped monks, warriors, shadow knights and paladins.  But, you will never be able to take much of a beating in melee, even if you go for AC rather than other stats.  Our armor class may be high, but our hit points and defensive skills are still generally lower than the 'pure' melee classes and the hybrid classes.
</P>

<P>
Most of your damage is from the <EM>back</EM> of the MOB.  You must feel comfortable using your Evade skill, or backing off if you start to get pummelled.
</P>

<P>
Pickpocketing makes it difficult for Rogues to get into groups - this is regardless of whether or not YOU personally pickpocket.
</P>

<P>
Many groups don't know how to play with a Rogue.  There's not many of us out there, and sometimes the few who play Rogues poorly are heard more about than those who play the class well.  Often you have to re-educate them, and have to be comfortable with doing this.  At lower levels - if you are not 'twinked' and the rogues who others have grouped with were very twinked, you may be expected to tank and take the brunt of the blows.  
</P>

<P>
You're not a tank, you're not a caster and you're not a hybrid who gets spells.  Who are you?  You fill much the same place as a monk, you're extra damage dealing machines who can't necessarily <EM>take</EM> damage directed at you.  Think of yourself as a Shaman/Warrior hybrid without the spells.  You have the hitpoints of a barbarian Shaman generally (or lower) and the skills of a warrior.
</P>

<P>
You will need to know how to make and save platinum because we are very equipment dependant and our class armor, Ravenscale, is one of the few nonquestable armors in the game.  It can be difficult to get into a group and fight for it, so you will likely have to purchase it (especially the breastplate).
</P>

<P>
Why you DO want to play a rogue:
</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>We do a lot of melee damage.  
<LI>With our improved hide/sneak we make good scouts (in dungeons where AE's are *not* cast and where mobs are not generally casting see invis on each other).
<LI>It's a lot of fun dealing damage without getting hit too much.
<LI>Our backstabs do a lot of damage VERY quickly
<LI>We look unique
<LI>Roleplaying a rogue is fun!
<LI>Poisoning is being improved and may become frequently useful in the future. Right now it's a fun toy. =)
</UL>
</P>

<H4>
When you roll your Rogue
</H4>

<P>
Rogues generally in the past used to be told to split points between Agility and Dexterity.  This was when everyone believed that Agility had to do with your chances and skill to hit, and Dexterity had to do with your chance of getting hit.
</P>

<P>
Now the above has been disproven for pure melee classes.  So, many Rogues are going the AC/Strength route.
</P>

<P>
Let me summarize what is known for sure about these stats:
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>AC</STRONG> - The higher the number the more hits you can take for the least damage.  If your AC is higher a MOB may hit you for 23, but if it's  low that may turn into 68 when it contacts you.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Strength</STRONG> - Allows you to carry more weight on you.  Also ups your potential damage that you can do with a weapon.  I have found that the more strength I have the harder I will hit for.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Agility</STRONG> - This affects your AC.  Though many disagree I do still feel that on a slight level, this ties into your dodge and parry skills.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Dexterity</STRONG> - The higher this number the higher the chance that a proc (or &quot;weapon process&quot; the effect that some weapons randomly will have) will go off in combat.  I have also heard that this is like &quot;INT&quot; for combat skills, the higher your dexterity the faster you will learn combat skills.  Verant has said that 'rogue skills' are dexterity dependant, I'm not sure which ones they mean...
</P>

<P>
Since this is on Neriak.com, I will focus on the Dark Elf Rogue.
</P>

<P>
I put most of my points into evening up Dxterity and Agility to 101.  I put any remaining into intelligence to get it to 101 (I prefer to learn skills fast) and any extra went into strength.
</P>

<P>
I'm not sure what I'd do differently if I were rerolling my Rogue today.  I believe that either the STR or the DEX/AGI rogue are very playable, it just depends on your playing style.  I would encourage you to plan to get your strength as a dark elf at least above 100.  It seems to make a <EM>Great</EM> difference in the melee damage inflicted.  And, in the end, that's why we're in groups - to inflict melee damage. =)
</P>

<H4>
Rogue Skills
</H4>

<P>
First I'd like to start by dispelling some myths that you may have if you go to play this game and haven't looked into Rogues at all.  Sense traps, Disarm traps and Picklocks aren't very used ingame.  In my personal adventuring I've seen only 1 trap in Solusek's Eye, and it hits for about 1 damage.  Not at all like the sort of traps from D&D that MUST be disarmed or the whole party dies.  Picklocks is used for our weapon (The Burning Rapier) quest, and there are locked doors in Befallen, a lower level dungeon.  There may be more locked doors in the Kunark expansion, but generally you don't need to put many points into each of these.  Pick locks can be practiced safely once you reach level 25 or so on the top locked door in Befallen (just put the picks on your lock pointer and press U until your hands hurt)
</P>

<P>
If you are a Dark Elf, you already start out with Hide. This skill is inherant to the race and will not raise until you reach level 16 or so.  After level 16, practice this and keep it up.  Your Evade skill depends on this.
</P>

<P>
Evade is tied with hiding.  When you are in combat and being hit, turn your auto attack off and press 'hide'. You will either get a message that you were successful in removing yourself from combat, or you will get a message that you failed.  When you succeed, you lower yourself on the monster's 'hate list' and it will generally turn to someone else.  This is a new skill and has GREATLY enhanced our survivability in groups.  This should be used when you have a primary tank that for some reason the monster won't 'stick' to.  This should NOT be used when your tank is dead and only you and a healer/caster are alive.
</P>

<P>
Sneak (at level 1) can be used in conjunction with hiding to let you travel (albeit VERY slowly!) past the undead that can typically see right through invisibility.  It sounds small, but this skill makes us one of the best corpse retreval classes and very much in demand on the planes.
</P>

<P>
At level 4 you get Dodge. Dodge does just that, helps you dodge and avoid a monster's blows.  Train 1 point into this, it will raise naturally during combat.
</P>

<P>
ONE THING I feel I should say here.  Though Rogues now have skills that allow them to AVOID combat, don't avoid too much.  You still want to get hit sometimes so that your defensive skills raise and to take heat off of the primary tank sometimes.  You do <EM>not</EM> want to avoid damage when the only other person on the hate list is a caster!  You will get a feel for the timing of this and how much damage you can 'safely' take as you progress in your playing.
</P>

<P>
Picklocks (level 6) is your next skill.  If you don't have immediate plans to practice this, don't.  If you wait longer to train your first point in it, your first point will raise you to a higher level of skill (ie training it at level 20 will give you more skill with one point spent then training it at level 6). It's very strongly hinted at that the Ruins of Kunark will have locked doors in it, so when you're ready, train a point into it, head to Befallen, put the picks on your mouse in front of the top locked door and start pressing U a lot. =)
</P>

<P>
On to probably the most controversial of our skills - Pick Pocket (level 7)  It's your choice whether or not to use this skill.  I play with my husband and since we share money, I'll do it when just he and I are grouped, but never when anyone else is grouped.  Pickpocketing too much WILL get you kicked out of groups.  And rightfully so, since when you pickpocket you are taking from the same 'pocket' (so to speak) as the one that the rest of the group gets their gold from.  So, in essence, you are stealing from your group.  It didn't used to be this way, extensive testing revealed that a separate pool that PP came from used to exist (sorry, Verant, too many rogues have hard numbers on this, you probably changed it to one pool when you changed something completely unrelated that linked to this).  Since it is no longer this way, you must make a decision on this issue - and realize that this will affect how all others see Rogues.  Please make a decision to not pickpocket all the time in groups.  In the end, you may be a few platinum poorer, but you'll have many more friends and hunting partners.  You can probably 'safely' pick here and there but if you pick dry constantly or even occasionally, you will find yourself with many less partners to group with.  At level 30 this key has actually been deleted from my banks, I just have too many other skills to have without spending space for this one that I consider useless in my own playing.
</P>

<P>
Sense traps (level 8).  Bleah, I trained a point in this for fun, and hit the key a lot of times, but in the end, there's really no use for it currently.
</P>

<P>
When Backstab (level 10) arrives you'll start to get the feel of what a Rogue is all about. =)  Train as many points as you can into this, leaving a fair amount for your level 13 and 16 skills coming up.  Some tips about backstab.  You MUST be facing it's back for this to work properly.  If you're not, you'll get it as an extra pierce instead.  So it's very important that your tank be on the opposite side of you facing the monster's ugly mug so you can backstab it at each opportunity.
</P>

<P>
Level 12 has you getting both Safefall and Parry.  Safefall makes so that you don't take damage on long falls.  When you run through Northern Ro later in your characters life, you'll appreciate this. =)  To practice it, put a point into it, and go to the entrance of Neriak.  Get up above the zone tunnel, and run down.  You'll either take damage or not.  You can also practice by jumping off the guard balconies in Neriak's Commons, jumping off of low rooftops and running up and down steep zonewalls.  When you either take damage or see a point of raised skill, you'll know that the wall is steep enough to practice on.  This skill has a 'cap' of 94, so you won't see any gains beyond that.
</P>

<P>
Parry is just like in fencing - if an opponent goes to strike, you can effectively block the blow with your weapon.  Put a few spare points into this, it will raise nicely on it's own. =)
</P>

<P>
At 13 you get duel wield.  Finally! =)  If you have all of your piercing skill maxxed out (you can see by taking (level*5)+5 ) decide what other weapon you may want to use later in your career and put one of those in your offhand.  Many rogues choose 1H slashing (there are some fast 1Hslashers available) and lately I've also been trying to raise my 1H blunt skill since at my level both piercing and 1H slash are maxxed.  Put a few points into this, you'll see this and all combat skills raising when you fight against blue 'con' or higher creatures.
</P>

<P>
Double attack (level 16) helps put the icing on the cake for Rogues, but you probably won't see much of a difference unless you either put a LOT of training points into it, or when you're level 20+.  Don't be discouraged, it pays off well in the end!
</P>

<P>
Two levels later, you can apply poison.  
</P>

<P>
Now, before we get really excited about this, let me tell you what the realities (as of 3-1-00) are of poisoning:
</P>

<P>
You will need to become a master potter.
</P>

<P>
Regular vials will cost around 2pp to make.  Lined vials 4-5pp.  This is with a DE with the 'normal' Rogue charisma.  This isn't including the money you will 'waste' on getting your pottery skill up, or on the fails you will have.
</P>

<P>
Fail checks in doing poisons are as follows - when you make the vial, when you fire the vial, when you make the poison (after you can), when you apply the poison and when you try to poison the monster you're fighting.  That's 5 skill checks to do about 150++ damage.  You need to determine if this is worth it <EM>to you</EM>.
</P>

<P>
Now, I will say that along the line you'll be able to make a poison that debuffs magic, that is a nicer DOT, and an undead specific poison.  The rumor is that as your make poison and apply poison skills rise (note that they ARE level capped) your poisons become more potent.
</P>

<P>
I use poison, and I enjoy it, but it's not <EM>useful</EM> to me. It's more of a 'have fun and be very roguely' type thing for me. =)  There are poison changes in the works, so we'll see what comes to pass...
</P>

<P>
So at level 18 you get apply poison.  You wonder where you'll get the poison from.  There are 3 poison quest NPC's that you can get it from.  One is in the Karanas, one is in Dagnor's Cauldron and one is in the tunnels beneath W Freeport.
</P>

<P>
I've only gotten the poison from Toxdil in W. Freeport.  He wants 2 Snake Poison Sacs (they're green/red looking) and 20 gold, and he'll give you a vial of snake poison.
</P>

<P>
Once you can make at level 20, you'll only be able to make snake and spider poisons, and they'll be trivial to you at once.  You won't be able to even start making the more advanced poisons until level 22, and even then you'll fail a lot up until about level 27.
</P>

<P>
You get the suspensions for the poison making and the mortar/pestile from the poison quest NPC's in the Karana's or in Dagnor's.
</P>

<P>
You may be wondering again, why do poison?  For fun, for character enhancement. =)
</P>

<P>
Disarm trap comes at level 21. Don't even bother training into this skill right now, as Verant won't be adding more traps or adding them in the expansion (so they say. ;) )
</P>

<P>
Instill doubt.  You can train this at level 22. When this works, it sets the mob off in a fear-style run.  This is also known by many groups at the 'train starter' in indoor dungeons because when the fear wears off it WILL bring friends.  This skill raises EXTREMELY SLOWLY (even for a Dark Elf with 105 intelligence) and works maybe 1/10 times for me (my skill is VERY low).  Using this indoors is suicide, using it outdoors on wandering MOBs is usually OK.
</P>

<P>
Disarm - this is basically just knocking the weapon out of a MOB's hand and having it land on the ground.  AT level 27 you can train this skill.  This is nice as long as their fists don't do MORE damage than the weapon they carry.  You'll get the hang of judging this as you progress in skill.  If you have a necromancer friend, practice this on their pet. You'll never actually be able to disarm them, but you WILL raise your skill QUICKLY practicing this way. =)
</P>

<P>
The last one - Riposte.  Currently I'm at level 30, and I'm gaining skill in this, though I haven't seen it do anything.  In theory, you can block a blow and inflict one at the same time when you do this, though as I said, I haven't seen that happen yet.
</P>

<H4>
Normal Combat for a Rogue
</H4>

<P>
A normal fight may go like this:
</P>

<P>
Scout for a MOB, or let the tank pull for the group (more about this later).  MOB returns to group. Let the tanks get 1-2 rounds with it if they have fast weapons.  2-4 swings if they're using a 2 hander.  Get in there at the back of the MOB and start meleeing, inserting backstabs as it pops up.
</P>

<P>
If your tank is taunting, the MOB should only turn on you if you have an offensive proc, or if you are overdamaging them (which can definitely happen if you have nice weapons and they don't).
</P>

<P>
Rogues pull well, I hear, in the planes.  I've since been updated that rogues in the planes usually scout and don't necessarily PULL.  But I haven't been able to pull well and then evade so that I'm no longer the 'primary beating target'.  I have read that way back when we could pull singles from a group with a bow and sneak, but I hear now that this has been 'fixed'.
</P>

<H4>
Other thoughts
</H4>

<P>
I will never give ANYONE a lecture on twinking, I have no problem with it, I've done it and it's a natural thing I think for players to do. If you disagree, that's fine but I'm tired of seeing perfectly nice people and good players in EQ get insulted and figuratively spit on for twinking a character that they have <EM>researched</EM> and <EM>will</EM> play to 50.  Let people have fun in their own way.
</P>

<P>
If you choose to twink, don't start out your level 5 rogue with dual SBDs.  Pick a weapon with a shorter delay so you get your piercing skill up quicker.  Ease off on decking out in all Ravenscale too.  You want your defensive skills to go up nicely, and it's rumored that too much AC will negate the raising of this skill.
</P>

<P>
In general, if you're working on a skill (let's say 1H blunt in your offhand) pick the SHORTEST delay weapon you can.  Why?  The more swings you get, the more skill raise potential you'll have. =)
</P>

<P>
Do not <EM>ever ever</EM> practice melee skills on anyone elses prey without asking and getting consent first.  EVER.  The 'standing close and practicing while I'm really pickpocketing it dry' technique of robbing players has been used time and time again, and it gives others who play this wonderful class a bad rep to overcome.  And, I have seen rogues KS just by 'practicing their backstab'.  Just be polite and ask first - even when practicing something like throwing.  You'll probably get a thanks for asking first, no matter what their answer is.
</P>

<P>
This is a truism - under level 30 (at the LEAST), a necromancer pet <EM>CANNOT</EM> tank for you.  Unless you have only your newbie weapon and a rusty dagger, you WILL outdamage the pet and the MOB <EM>will</EM> try to eat you for supper.  My husband (Necromancer) and I tried duoing with the pet 'tanking' for me and unless you fear-kite, it doesn't work out.  If you join a group that says &quot;oh the pets will be the tank&quot; and there's not at least 2 healers (one a cleric that can symbol you and one a shaman that can buff before battle), leave.
</P>

<P>
This brings me to the point of educating your groups on what you can and cannot do.
</P>

<P>
If someone suggests you pull in an area that you know, well hell, it's worth a shot.  Be sure the healer is fullmana and try pulling and evading when you get back. It may work for you, it may not.  It's not worked for me yet, but it may depend on where you're hunting and the AI of the MOB.
</P>

<P>
If it's suggested you tank instead of the 'tank' in the group, ask them their HP and AC.  They probably have a lot more.  
</P>

<P>
You will WANT and almost REQUIRE a tank your level or better.  Because they are the ones that can keep a MOB taunted off of you the best.
</P>

<P>
Fear kiting is your best friend.  I've had great success with just my husband's necromancer, a friend cleric and me fear kiting. =)  When we can hit MOBs from the back, we really shine! =)
</P>

<P>
This is as of me hitting level 32, and I'll probably have more to add in the future. =)
