Morfedius was raised in a very unique way, not common in the lands of
Norrath.  Not much is known about his life currently, but to understand him,
you must understand his background.  In the year 2679, Vargo Az'tiel, a dark
elf member of the Indigo Brotherhood, was en route back home from a Rathe
Mountains expedition when he stopped at Lake Rathetear to replenish his
supplies and rations at the Gypsy camp near the mountians. That is when he
first laid eyes on a beautiful gypsy by the name of Noressa Sparkle.  There
was a unique chemistry between the two, and Vargo persuaded Noressa into
leaving her camp, to return back home to LavaStorm to become his wife.
</P>

<P>
On their way back to Neriak, the two entered the Nektulos forest where they
were approached by a few members of the Indigo Brotherhood, who did not
believe in the inter-racial relationship between Vargo and Noressa, and had
them jailed, to await sentencing for their crimes.  But, Vargo managed to
get a word out to close friend and fellow Indogo brother, Kizdean Gix, with
instructions to come and rescue Noressa and take her to somewhere safe in
Freeport, where the Indigo Brotherhood would not find her.  Kizdean gave
Vargo his word that his love, would be in good hands, and he immediately
snuck Noressa out of Neriak.
</P>

<P>
Later that day, when the guards noticed Noressa had been gone from her cell,
they immediately searched all of Neriak and Nektulos, with no luck finding
the fleeing human.  As a punishment to Vargo, for bringing a human into the
sacred forest, he was executed by the brotherhood, without a trial.
</P>

<P>
Noressa never did hear of her love, Vargo's fate.  On their way to Freeport,
she was raped and stranded in the commonlands by Kizdean. The one who was
supposed to guide her to sanctuary, betrayed his brother, Vargo, and planted
an evil seed inside the helpless widow.
</P>

<P>
Completely alone, and unable to return back to her home in Rathetear,
Noressa befriended Altunic Jartin east of the commonlands, and he taught her
the art of jewelry making as an aside to survive in the vast desolate
commonlands.  9 months later, a bastard son was born, whom she named
Morfedius.  Saddened by the child, for the father was unknown to be either
Vargo or Kizdean, Noressa abondoned the child at the home of her new friend
Altunic, and fled west further into the commonlands, in hiding.
</P>

<P>
Morfedius never knew who his mother was.  Growing up, he was told by
Altunic, that he was his son, and his mother had died early in the great
plague.  He raised Morfedius in the church of Marr, where he was taught how
to heal the people of his home, so in case another plague came, they would
not pass, as his mother did.  He also helped Altunic in his lifelong cause
to rid the commonlands of the evil Dark Elves that had now tried to take
over the commonlands for their own.
</P>

<P>
While on a run for supplies in the west commonlands, Morfedius came across a
dark elf hassling local merchants and travelers near an inn close to Befallen.  He
approached the elven terror, and gave him an order to flee back home to
Neriak, and leave the poor humans alone.  The dark elf was not so
cooperative though, and he slashed Morfedius in the side of the leg.
Morfedius slayed the elf in an epic battle, and carried his bloody body back
to Altunic as a trophy for his cause.
</P>

<P>
On first sight, Altunic was shocked, for he knew the corpse was Kizdean, of
the Indigo Brotherhood. He had known the truth surrounding Morfedius' birth,
and knew of the possibilities that Morfedius had just slain his possible
father, and decided it was finally time to tell him the truth regarding his
past.
</P>

<P>
Morfedius did not say a word.  He searched the whole desolate commonlands
for his
mother vowing he would not rest till she was found.  Four years later, he
found his mother at a local shop providing fine goods and jewelry to the
public.  He spoke to her, and told her who he was.  Completely lost for
words, she disowned her son, saying she could never love him, for she would
never know who is true father was.  Morfedius turned away, never to return
to that jewelry store ever again.  He had now known his true heritage, and
he was contempt, while he vowed to destroy the Indigo Brotherhood, for the
damage it had cost him.
