Sobe, tired, exhausted and bleeding sits down to draw the magical energies
from Norrath, of which he has none left, and bring forth the magical powers
to heal.  When... suddenly heal feels a sharp pain run down his shoulder as
a rusty hammer slams into him with unnatural strength.  Sobe deftly spins to
see an Orc standing over him with a sharp tooth grin....  It is time like
this when one must rely on a strong weapon and armor to survive.
</P>

<P>
Armor, weapons, jewelry, clothing, magic items; these are all items that
everyone from caster to warrior needs to survive in Norrath.  But where do
you get them?  There are a number of ways:  1) Loot them or quest for them
2) Buy them from an NPC merchant 3) Buy or trade for them with other
players.  Hmmm.... well lets think here for a second.  Number one is fine if
your a level 50 something or another, sure you can camp stuff (I still do)
but what if that specific item you want requires a full group, none the
less, a full group of higher levs then you.  And as for quests, who wants to
spend that much time questing.  The experience usually does not warrant it
and the quests can be quite time consuming.  Well that leaves that option in
the dust. Ok lets look at the second option....unless your buying provisions
and gems, number two is pretty much useless.... 3210pp for crafted
gauntlets.... I think not.  Finally we come to my favorite, number three.
Other players are your largest source of items, face it unless you camp it
yourself or do the quest your not going to get that blackened iron crown you
want or that crafted breastplate.  
</P>

<P>
Ok with all that aside its time to learn how to be a merchant, someone who
just does not kill everything in site, someone who through smarts a guile
can create a fortune and not have to be level 50.   The reasons to become a
merchant are self explanatory, platinum and items that you would not
normally have.  But, you say &quot;But I am level 9 with ten plat to my name, 
how on earth am I going to get that crafted helm I want&quot;  Let me show 
you the way.
</P>

<P>
First, just a little side note on what class I feel makes the best merchant,
especially for dark elves. The cleric.  Plain and Simple.  The cleric offers
everything one needs to be a great merchant.   1) At level 9 a cleric can
make both food and water, very handy as a dark elf, when normal merchants
won't sell to you. 2)   When traveling and selling your wares occasional
battles happen, its nice to be able to heal yourself and have decent armor.
3) Clerics no matter of race seem to make friends very easy with heals,
cures, and buffs... it is the friends you make that will be your lifeline to
other items. 4) As a cleric gets higher in level and starts to group more
often, you tend to med very much; this you will see is a great advantage.
Some say that enchanters make the best merchants because of the ability to
make magical jewelry... BAH you know how long and expensive it is to become
a master jeweler.  
</P>

<P>
OK if your not a cleric don't worry, anybody can be a merchant and here is
how.  Lets take that ten plat and make it into a tidy sum.  Please keep in
mind this is just an example to help me show how to make you some plat.  The
course of action may or may not fold out this way in reality (um... in
Norrath).
</P>

<P>
To be a merchant one must always pay attention to all auctions, yes all of
them.  I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.  It is also important to have a notepad
with a pen or pencil to write names and items down, this is going to be your
bible as a merchant.  In times when you are fighting this can be very tuff,
but if your a spell caster, say a cleric, you can do this while you med.
Give the auctioneer a tell ask how much or what they are looking for in
trade.  This offers two important tools, A) it starts to give you an idea
what the current market is for an item B) you may in the future find someone
selling or trading an item that this particular auctioneer wants (this is
known as becoming the middle man) CHA CHING
</P>

<P>
Next, one must make friends be social even with the light ones.  Don't have
to be their friend but at least act like it.  &quot;Keep your friends close 
and your enemies closer.&quot;  Ask them a question, or anybody for that 
matter, if they are selling anything.  Why?  Because there are many players 
out there who don't actively sell but have items rotting in the bank.  Write 
down what they have and/or make a bid on an item. 
</P>

<P>
Also, BUY BUY BUY BUY even if the item is something you don't need or can
use. Of course you want to make a profit so remember buy at a cost that you
know is, or feel is, a great bargain.  Lets take or life saving s of ten
plat.  I happen to know that a Runed Totem Staff goes for anywhere between
10-20pp (Povar Server).  I happen to see one for auction.  I give PLAYERA a
tell, she wants 20pp.  That I know is pretty much the cap for that item, so
I offer 7pp.  She laughs at me.  I laugh back with a hehe.  Then I tell her
I can offer 10pp &quot;Its all I have&quot; (boy that line works great, 
people tend to feel sorry for you when you say that... take advantage but 
remember don't abuse it because you will burn many bridges if your caught... 
in this case its the truth)  In this scenario 9 out of ten times PLAYERA will 
give in and sell it to you for ten plat.  Congrats you have your first 
inventory as a merchant.  Lets go sell it.
</P>

<P>
Here are some tips on Buying:
</P>

<P>
1) When purchasing an item make sure you have a very good idea what that
item is worth.  This can be obtained from your notepad, or websites, or your
guild, or even friends that you have made &quot;Hey Friend know how much a 
Runed Totem staff goes for?&quot;.  I spend lots of time reading websites 
and gauging the prices of items.  Remember prices differ from server to 
server; depending on supply and demand.  Your older servers tend to have more 
high level items at lower prices.
</P>

<P>
2)HAGGLE.   Its your greatest tool.  Don't buy anything if you don't think
you can make a profit on it.
</P>

<P>
3) If you get the &quot;Make offer&quot; response, make an offer but make it 
very low.  This is to your advantage. Usually after making a low offer the 
person will respond with the following &quot;LOL, they usually sell for 
x&quot;  Great now you have a price to work with and you can start to haggle.  
Second, once I offered 50pp for a Flowing Black Robe and the person sold it 
to me!  I then sold it for 200pp, a very nice 150pp profit if I may say so 
myself.  This happens when either the player does not know the value, or they 
just don't care because they have 10000pp in the bank, or it was a gift and 
they don't need it.
</P>

<P>
Buying stuff to fill your inventory is important, SELLING it is even more
so.  Here are some tips on selling:
</P>

<P>
1) Sell by city zones:  they are the most traveled and usually have the best
ranges in levels.
</P>
  
<P>
2) Set a price in your mind and stick to it.  We are going to sell our
purchased Runed Totem Staff for at least 15pp hopefully 20pp
</P>

<P>
3)Create social buttons for all your items, shift up arrow will work; but,
if your doing a lot tells and speaking to your group that can be a real
pain.  So I create social buttons for my items.  example /auc Runed Totem
staff 9dmg, 48dly 2HB MAGIC +5man +5hp  Notice that I give the stats and the
full name of the item.  This is important because a well informed buyer is
better,  if they give you a &quot;how much?&quot; tell, they want it.  This 
eliminates the &quot;what are stats?&quot; questions as well.
</P>

<P>
4) Survey the buyer the a /who namehere.  Hopefully they are not anon, and
you can see their level.  By looking at their level you can calculate how
much they can afford.  If they are anon, well you have someone who knows
enough about the game to do so. (which brings up an interesting point,
always sell in either anon or role-playing mode.  If it is a shrew buyer
they may use your lev as an advantage.  Geez how did you get that at x lev?
Don't know why but some buyers have a big gripe about buying from a
substantially lower level character then them or because you are so low they
try to low ball your price thinking you do not know better.  And if you make
the sale in most cases by the time they /con you the deal has been done and
it is too late to turn back.)
</P>

<P>
5) Keep an eye out for twinkers.  They are a merchant's best friend.
Usually these people have a high level character with pretty deep pockets.
They are easy to spot, you know the levl 3 with a Flowing Black Robe. But
they are great to sell to.  When your other character has 2000pp in the
bank, who cares about spending 25pp on a Runed Totem staff.  CHA CHING
</P>

<P>
6) When asked &quot;How much?&quot;  Always give a overpriced amount. You can 
always haggle and hey you never know they may take it.  Again remember the 
tip #2 don't take less then what you set.
</P>

<P>
SO know we know the basics lets see how our scenario with the Runed Totem
Staff works out.
</P>

<P>
<PRE>
In east commons
PLAYERA auctions:  Runed Totem Staff
/tell playerA how much?
PLAYERA: 20pp 
(I know this is the cap usually for a RTS)
/tell playera hmmm... i can give 8pp
PLAYERA:  i am really looking for at least 15pp
/tell playera  the most i can give is 10pp its all i have and that would tap
me out, probably can't even afford food after that )
PLAYERA: hehe Ok meet me at tunnel
OK you run to tunnel and finish the purchase, fast foward
in west commons
/who Playera 
(why? well if i'm going to sell it at least I can have the common courtesy
to be in a different zone.  Some people get mad when you buy something from
them and sell it right in front of them.  Try not to burn bridges)
make social button /auc Runed Totem Staff dmg 9 dly 48 2HB MAGIC +5 hp
+5mana
use button
wait....
wait...
wait...
use button
wait...
PLAYERB: how much?
(cheer we have a customer)
/tell playerb 20pp
PLAYERB: I just saw one for 10pp, don't you think thats too much? 
/tell playerb wow 10pp thats a good price, well I sold my last one I had for
18pp but I can give you this one for 17pp
PLAYERB: still much how about 13pp
/tell playerb hold for sec
PLAYERB: k
wait...
/tell playerb ok i have an offfer of 16pp but since I got your tell first I
will sell you for 15pp
( SO I LIED. I am a dark elf)
PLAYERB: cool i will take it thanks!
(hehe made it like I am doing him a favor... just made a new friend)
/tell playerb ok meet me at derv camp
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
CHA CHING 5 plat profit at lev 10, total time about 10 minutes.  Now we have
15pp to work with.
</P>

<P>
The idea is to always make a profit.  Even if it may be only one or two plat
in the beggining.  It adds up trust me. Always remember to upgrade your
inventory.  After a couple more exchanges at this level items say skull of
jhen'tra, purity belts, and so on; you should be in the 25-30pp range.  Time
to upgrade the inventory on higher level stuff.  Bronze Armor is great for
this for example.  Bronze can be bought as little as 7gp per AC and sold as
high as 3pp per AC.  Bought a small bronze helm one for 2pp and then sold it
for 25pp.
</P>

<P>
So that's some of my secrets of being a merchant.  Can't give them all.   On
a final note some insight.  If you are serious about making money and you
follow these tips you should be rolling in platinum. However, there are some
bad points.  Being a merchant is very time consuming and you won't level
that fast.  So if you like to power level this is probably not your avenue.
Another thing to keep in mind in patience, patience, patience.  Hold onto
items as long as you can, you will eventually find someone to buy at the
price you want to sell at, heck on Povar when you can get a SBH for 50pp
now, I still sell them to twinkers for 100pp.  If things get slow group up
and level; just stick to your selling price.  Keep as much inventory and
money on you as possible; you lose precious time running to banks.  ALWAYS
write down how much it cost you to buy or trade for something.  And my last
bit of advice always end a transaction with this statement &quot;hey if you 
need anything or selling anything look me up&quot;.
</P>

<P>
So good hunting and happy selling.
