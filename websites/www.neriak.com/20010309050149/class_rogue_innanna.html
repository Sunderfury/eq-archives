<P>
Greetings fellow Tier'dal.  My name is Innanna, and I am what the more law-abiding citizens of Norrath call a rogue, although I prefer the term &quot;Free Trader&quot;.
</P>

<P>
My career choice is not an illustrious one, nor was it really a choice.  I shall never command the respect of a spellcaster, nor the fear of a shadowknight.  My birth was a humble one, you see.  I am the daughter of one of the many prostitutes found in the Third Gate of Neriak (although my mother prefers the term &quot;Lady of Negotiable Virtue&quot;).  Therefore, I did not have the correct contacts to make it to the vaunted School of Magic, nor the Temple of Hate.  But I'm not about to let that hold me back, and I'm going to share as many of my hard-earned lessons as I can with my fellow rogues.
</P>

<P>
My first recommendation for you rogues of Neriak is to turn away from Innoruuk, and take a closer look at the teachings of Bristlebane.  I know that Innoruuk is our Father, but he is only going to hold you back in your interaction with the lesser races of Norrath.  You will never be able to milk the hairless monkeys of Freeport of their hard earned platinum if you are killed by the guards.  Now, you will lose some respect with the zealots who patrol the Nek, and they will glower at you, but those fanatics are too busy being killed to pay much attention to you.
</P>

<P>
You must ask yourself why you became a rogue in the first place.  I'm guessing it has something to do with the money.  That's why I'm in the business.  And it is hard to make money when you are full of bile.  If you want to be consumed by hate, and don't have the right connections to become a shadowknight or a necromancer, then become a fighter and go swing your sword someplace else.  From now on I'm only talking to those of you who are interested in making money and a name for yourself.
</P>

<P>
What's that?  How important is a name for yourself?  Well, fame is very important.  Always deal honestly with people, that's the first rule.  You might think that being a rogue means taking the money and running with it, never looking back.  But that means you aren't looking forward, either.  Believe me, you might pull one or two stunts like that, but your name will get around and nobody will deal with you, and there goes your profit margin.  The more people trust you, the more they are willing to pay you to do things.
</P>

<P>
Now, what kind of things?  What can you, a puny street urchin barely off your mother's teat, do?  You have just emerged from the warrens of Neriak, and are standing in the Nek, shading your eyes from the glare of the sun.  Where do you go?  Run forward until you reach a path, then follow that path to the left.  The creatures around here are fairly easy to kill.  Go for decaying skeletons, and keep any bone chips you find.  And destroy any snake you come across.  A quest in the rogue's guild calls for four snakeskins, and the reward in experience is very good until you reach the fourth or fifth rank.  Keep doing this until you reach fifth level.  It shouldn't take you very long.
</P>

<P>
Now, each time you run back to Neriak for training, shout out that you are making a run to the city, and are taking orders for food, water, and spells.  You will get responses fairly frequently, especially from high level heroes that have been hunting north of the Lavastorm mountains and are resting up before they go back.  Be nice to these heroes.  Admire their armor or weapons, and ask polite questions about where they got them and what feats they performed.  Sometimes, they will reward this line of questioning.  Other times, you make an ally that you can call upon later.  Collect some money from them to purchase their food and water, then bring the items back to them with all possible speed.  They appreciate promptness.  They reward it, too.  I think they like the idea that a young one is actually earning his or her keep, and not just standing around asking for handouts.
</P>

<P>
Keep an eye out for the rare Erudite, Human, or Elf enchanter that is looking for the enchant metal scrolls that are found in the library of the Third Gate.  They will pay a very good price for those scrolls.  Those who are looking for the enchant platinum scroll will usually pay very well because they are of a very high rank, and are about to start making quite a lot of money.
</P>

<P>
When you have reached fifth level, which you can do fairly quickly if you keep doing the ebon shield quest that I mentioned earlier, start hunting black bears, shadow wolves, and large spiders.  If you are lucky enough to find a high quality bearskin, or a shadow wolf pelt, hang on to it because tailors pay quite a bit of money for such items.  The bearskin will go for upwards of 15 platinum, and the wolf pelt will sell for around 5 platinum.  Spider silk from the large spiders can also be sold to tailors for a good amount of money, usually from 5 gold to 1 platinum per silk.  As you slowly advance in level, start taking on the tougher foes, like the skeletons.  Always keep the bone chips, because you can sell them in bundles of 20 for several platinum.  By the time you earn your ninth rank, you will probably have quite a bit of money in the bank.
</P>

<P>
Now, the point of money isn't just to collect it, but to spend it, right?  You can't eat platinum, and you can only wear it if it is jewelry.  So always be on the lookout for people selling items that you can use.  Dvinn's Dirk is a good dagger for a rogue.  Try to pick up barbed leggings and arms.  Get banded if it is going fairly cheap.  Perhaps one of those high rank adventurers that you helped out earlier can make banded, or perhaps he knows somebody who can.  It's all about networking!
</P>

<P>
When you make the 10th rank, it is time to enter the Commons.  Join up with some people and kill a few orcs.  Let them marvel at how well you work in a group, and how remarkably well adjusted you are for a Tier'dal.  Then let them know that you worship Bristlebane, and not Innoruuk.  That should turn a few heads.  Find a group, or several groups, of people, and start to work on that reputation as a fair and honest party member.  You are going to need it.  When you get the ability to pick pockets, that reputation is the only thing that is going to get you invited into adventuring parties.  You see, we have this ability to swipe the good loot from a monster before it is killed, and without the other party members knowing about it.  That can make you very unpopular if somebody finds out.  Perhaps your group kills several creatures that are carrying very little money.  Who do you think they are going to suspect?  Even if it wasn't your fault?  So a good reputation is the only thing that will save your bacon at higher ranks.
</P>

<P>
When you reach rank 12 or so, I recommend heading for the Lavastorm mountains.  Find a lonely druid, and team up with that person.  They are great allies in the Lavastorm area, because they have a spell that does horrible things to summoned creatures like fire elementals and lava crawlers.  Work your way up a bit there, looking around and getting a feel for the place.  Be careful of the imps, and stay out of the pools of lava.  When you kill drakes, start collecting putrid bile.  I think it can be used to make poison later.  I'll let you know when I find out.
</P>

<P>
One final little trick that can get you quite a bit of cash in a hurry.  Find a group of giant slayers, and tag along.  Watch them fight the giant, and oooh-and-aaaah at their prowess.  Congratulate them on their speed.  Whatever comes to mind.  All the time you are keeping this dialogue up, pick the giant's pockets.  You will get away with some platinum, usually not enough that the giant killers will notice it.  It's good practice, and will be something to look back and laugh at later in life.
</P>

<P>
Good luck to all of you.  If you see me, be sure to say hello.
