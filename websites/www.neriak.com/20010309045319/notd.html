There has not been much work done on defining the nature of Teir'dal, and in 
assisting with deciding how to roleplay them.  Of course, in the end, it is 
always up to the player to decide how best to roleplay his/her character, but 
some guidance is always a good thing.  Given that the existing work on the 
nature and mindset of Teir'dal is IMO written from a very limited (and 
<EM>directly</EM> in opposition to Teir'dal) viewpoint.  It is for this reason 
that I am writing this guide.
</P>

<P>
The first thing to keep in mind that Dark Elves are called evil <EM>only by 
those who do not like them</EM>!  In the mind of a Dark Elf, he (or she, no 
gender bias implied) is just acting upon his will and doing what he desires to 
do. Dark Elves do not consider themselves evil.  Yes, they feel hate, and yes 
they fight and kill, and maybe even enjoy it -- but they are only acting on 
their true will, completely unbound by the strictures of fascist religions.  
Their religion allows them the freedom to do as they will, without fear of 
judgement or other ill action. Dark Elves are not evil, they are free!  Trolls 
and Ogres do take pleasure in torture and feasting upon the other races, which 
is certainly evil -- Dark Elves do not do these things.  The other races are 
bound by their gods to not do such things as kill animals, or to help those in 
need no matter the cost, or (purely from an RP standpoint) not sleep around.  
Dark Elves can kill who they wish, at any time; we do not have to help anyone 
unless we feel like it or can gain from it; and we are the only race in Norrath 
to have a Brothel. ;)

By far most Teir'dal worship Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate.  He created the Dark 
Elves and watches over them and grants them much power.  He is considered an 
evil god by the lesser races, but this is because they envy the freedom and 
power that comes with the worship of our Father.  Innoruuk merely allows the 
freedom to choose -- you are allowed to hate those whom you hate, you are not 
required to somehow find a way to love them. Hate is good where hate is 
deserved, and you do not have to deny your true will and nature.

What have I to gain in expending large amounts of my mana to save some poor weak 
Human who can't handle the battle he started, possibly endangering myself from 
lack of mana?  NOTHING! Should he not have made sure he could handle the battle 
before he began it?  What have I to gain in jumping into a fight with my sword, 
possibly gaining the unwanted and possibly deadly affections of an angry 
monster, just to save an idiot weakling High Elf who got in over his head?  
NOTHING!  If they are so high and mighty, let them fight their own battles!  As 
Children of Innoruuk, we have the freedom to do what is best for our own good, 
and not fear any retribution for those actions.  
</P>

<P>
As a Teir'dal you do not have to commit overtly evil acts. Just do what is best 
for yourself, always remembering that the Father demands that you obey your true 
will, always doing what you wish to do, never endangering yourself or costing 
yourself money or items in service to others -- unless you gain greatly from 
such service.  This is the beauty of roleplaying a Teir'dal -- you can always do 
what is best for your character and have it is fully in character and desirable 
to do so.  
</P>

<P>
Even for other Teir'dal you do not have to risk your life.  A Cleric, certainly, 
would put himself in harm's way for another of Innoruuk's children -- but a 
Warrior, Necromancer, Shadow Knight, or any other class, would likely not lift a 
finger to help even another Teir'dal unless they had something to gain in doing 
so.  Ogres and Trolls would also likely be allowed to die before a Teir'dal 
would lift a finger to help, again unless the Teir'dal had something to gain in 
doing so.  Or wanted to -- it's all up to you, just realize that you cannot be 
expected to act like a Paladin. :)
