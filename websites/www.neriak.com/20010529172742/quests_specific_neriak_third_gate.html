Loveal S`Nez

Noxhil V`Sek
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Part of the menial tasks that need to be done by all young ones is gathering various research components for their tutors.  Noxhil V`Sek requires 10 fire beetle eyes for his experiments.

<STRONG>The Hall of the Ebon Mask</STRONG><BR>
Pazin Punox
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The king has commanded that Pazin find someone to teach a halfing, Lil Honeybugger, a lesson. Pazin instructions you to go to Misty Thicket beyond the Great Wall to find her, kill her and return her head to him.  He also mentions that she's usually accompanied by her brother...  Go to Misty Thicket, and find the two. Rumor has it that her brother is about level 12ish so bring friends. =)  Kill her, return the head for your 'reward'.  Unless this quest has changed you get about 3 copper and Pazin laughs at you and tells you that he just wanted her killed because he'd gotten her pregnant with his child. (specific faction and reward information unknown, but you take a huge halfling hit for killing her and her brother.)

<STRONG>The Spires of Innoruuk</STRONG><BR>
Perrir Zexus
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As a new member of the Spires of Innoruuk, you are required to obtain and wear the symbol of your station and faith.  Find four holy symbols of the Halfling druids that infest our forest for your hematite symbol of Innoruuk.  Go out there into the forest and kill the Druids (NOT the leatherfoot deputies, which are warriors).  You *may* get jumped by the Leatherfoot Medic which can randomly spawn near them (he's killed a level 32 necro before, so be careful!).  Gather four of their bracelets and you gain the Hematite Symbol of Innoruuk.  The Symbol of Innoruuk has 3AC, 1 WIS, 3 MANA. (specific faction information unknown at this time)

Ithvol K`Jasn
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are an initiate, Ithvol has a task for you.  The halflings that invest our forest somehow seem to anticipate our next moves.  Find Master Whoopal, slay him and bring the brain to Draxiz N'Ryt so that he may analyze the brain. (no further information known)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are a disciple, Ithvol has a task for you.  King Naythox Thex wishes to expand our empire to Faydwer, and there is a band of Teir`dal there that depends on us to bring them supplies, since they are always under attack from the lesser Feir'Dal and Koada'Dal.  You must go with haste and tell Dran Slug Rembor in the Foreign Quarter that Ithvol sent you. (submitted by Saver) (no further information known)
