We who roleplay Dark Elves have a lot of strikes against us.  Forget about the 
game mechanics negatives such as being KOS in many cities - I'm talking about 
the problems other players pose. 
</P>

<P>
Dark Elves are racists.  That is a fact, and no one disputes it, despite 
differing theories on how they should think and act.  Dark Elves don't like 
other races.  They put up with trolls and ogres occasionally, but other races, 
forget it.  This poses problems with other players, as 99% of the EQ playing 
public does not roleplay; they simply play the game, and they expect that you as 
a Dark Elf will help them and/or group with them even if they are a Wood Elf.  
They don't understand roleplaying, and they get very upset if you refuse to help 
or group with them.
</P>

<P>
This wouldn't be a problem if EQ were not designed from the ground up to require 
grouping.  But it was, and group we must, unless we are willing to suffer some 
pretty staggering downtime.  It also wouldn't be a problem if more people played 
Dark Elves, but they don't; we are a minority.  So, we are faced with a dilemma.  
As roleplayers, we don't want to group with the light races, or help them.  But 
as players, we must group with other players and in order to be accepted we have 
to help other people when they are in trouble.  Very, very out of character for 
a Dark Elf.
</P>

<P>
Adding to the grouping problem is the fact that at the higher levels, especially 
for Plane and Dragon fights, no one will allow you into a group unless you've 
grouped with them before!  Fair enough, though, those fights are very, very 
dangerous, and unless someone is sure you know what you're doing, they can't 
trust you.  Since you can be sure there will never be an all Dark Elf 
plane/dragon raid, you see where at least at 46+ you're going to need to group 
with light races.
</P>

<P>
What is the solution to this dilemma?  Many ideas have been tried and employed 
by other roleplayers, and the &quot;right&quot; solution for you will depend on 
how willing you are to either compromise roleplaying purity or suffer long 
downtimes.  Finding the balance that keeps it fun for you is the key.
</P>

<P>
One solution, though a very hard one, is to simply say &quot;screw it&quot; and 
take your chances, and simply not group with or help light races.  You will 
suffer very high downtime, because you'll probably never get a full 6-person 
group.  You will probably never be able to hit the Planes or Dragons, because no 
one will know you, and there will never be an all Dark Race Plane or Dragon 
Raid.  But, if that is acceptable to you, then go for it!  This is roleplaying 
purity at it's pinnacle; no compromises.  I have seen many people try this and 
quit the game entirely out of frustration.  
</P>

<P>
Another solution, and perhaps the one Verant had in mind, is to separate the 
acts of roleplaying from the act of hunting and gaining levels.  When you are in 
a dungeon, or hunting outdoors, you are a game mechanics player, you do what you 
need to do to have fun at it, gain levels, and make money.  You group with those 
you get along with, and those of classes you need in the group regardless of 
their race.  You may roleplay in /shouts during this time but mostly you're just 
fighting and levelling.  Then when you are wanting to roleplay, you only 
associate with Dark Elves, and so on.  This may have been what Verant had in 
mind when they put in the /roleplay switch.  When you are RPing, you go /role 
and when you are levelling you take the flag off.  This solution allows you to 
experience all facets of the game and will allow you to make a lot of friends, 
which can be very helpful especially as you climb in levels.  Many hardcore 
roleplaying purists call this &quot;selling out&quot;, which I suppose it is - 
but the mechanics of Everquest demand some compromise. 
</P>

<P>
In between these two extremes there are many other solutions.  You could 
roleplay that the Dwarf Paladin in your group is under your powerful spell to 
serve your cause for a time.  You could roleplay that you are grudgingly hunting 
with other races because you are greedy and want to gain skill and riches at all 
cost.  You could roleplay saving a Wood Elf from death by saying you are only 
showing them the power of Innoruuk and the greatness of the Teir'dal race.  And, 
there is yet another solution, and one that we (the Neriak.com staff) are 
arriving at slowly but surely...
</P>

<P>
In the course of your adventures, you are going to meet some characters of light 
races who show themselves to be &quot;ok&quot; from your character's point of 
view.  For example, we know a Human Magician, she is a good friend of ours (hi 
Sangwyn ;) ).  She has a very dark streak that our characters very much admire.  
So through her, our characters have learned that some Humans are ok.  After all 
- humans are the only &quot;light race&quot; where most of the classes can 
worship Innoruuk.  Another example is an Erudite Wizard we just met last night.  
There was a Monk shouting throughout East Commonlands that all Dark Elves had to 
die, and for thirty minutes I taunted him into dueling me so I could silence 
him.  He finally showed up and before I could issue the challenge, this Erudite 
challenged him and slew him after rooting him and taunting him for a minute or 
so.  So through this incident, our characters learned that Erudites, too, can be 
ok.  This is working out well - through these experiences, our characters are 
learning that some people of light races can be ok.  So we're working grouping 
with them into our character's makeup.
</P> 

<P>
Good luck too all my Teir'dal brothers and sisters, regardless of which path you 
choose.
