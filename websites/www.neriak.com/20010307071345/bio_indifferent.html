<P>
It would be difficult to tell what I looked like when I first entered 
Norrath.  I did not have my smooth dark skin or silk-like white hair.  
Instead I had the ruddy complexion and coarse dark hair of a Wood Elf.  
</P>

<P>
Ever since I was young, I was angry.  I was filled with a rage I couldn't 
comprehend.  I hated everything from the way the birds sang to the way I was 
forced to become a tree hugging druid.  I couldn't tell who I hated more: 
Tunare for making me this way, my father for making me become a druid or 
Innoruuk for not making me a child of his, a powerful Teir'dal.
</P>

<P>
One day after another argument with my father I left home.  I took nothing.  
As I stalked off into the forest known as the Faydark I could hear my 
father's voice in the early evening &quot;Indifferent, do not return until you can 
accept your responsibility.&quot;
</P>

<P>
I walked for days.  I destroyed everything I touched.  Eventually I realized 
that with every thing I destroyed I caused my skin to turn a shade darker, 
till I looked every inch a grand Dark Elf.  Well, everything except my hair.
</P>

<P>
Months after leaving home that fateful night I arrived in Neriak.  My journey 
there was long, hard and fraught with danger.  I had to avoid Dwarven guards, 
spend weeks at see hidden in the bottom of a boat and then elude angry humans 
in the tunnels below Freeport.  
</P>

<P>
I immediately went to the Priests of Innoruuk, where I found out due to my 
unfortunate beginnings I could no longer claim any god as my own.  When I was 
told this I went into a rage like the Priests had never seen.  I destroyed 
everything in the room where I was, using magic's I didn't know I possessed.  
I even caused the Priests to obey my commands and even caused them to be 
mesmerized.  When I was done the remaining Priests just looked at me and 
smiled.  When I demanded to know what they were smiling at they just pointed 
to the mirror.  I was elated with what I saw.  My hair had turned white and 
with this came the revelation that I would become an Enchanter.  Changing my 
form and causing others to obey my will.  Soon I will be strong enough to 
face my father....
