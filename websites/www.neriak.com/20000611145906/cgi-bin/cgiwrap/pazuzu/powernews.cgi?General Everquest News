		Source: Everquest Patch Message.<p><br>Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:<p>General<p>Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes. Check your Kunark spell vendors. <br>Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon zoning. The majority of these issues should no longer occur. <br>Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest. <br>Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains. <br>Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark. They should be more plentiful now.  <br>Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones. <br>Items<p>A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword. Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword out for a working one. <br>The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession when you leave the game. <br>A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight. <br>Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark. <br>PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions<p>Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character. Players should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than desirable. <p>Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are. This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series. <p>Risk and Reward<p>The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest. Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide substantial risk. Over the past several weeks, we've been identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary adjustments. <p>In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a specific action. For example, we recently increased the experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated with adventuring there. We also do this quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest. <p>However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above as we come across them. For example, there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk. <p>Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did want to let you know that you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next several weeks.<p>PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers<p>As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat. Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<p>Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move. Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000. You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window. There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<p>Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not be rescinded. The actual character-move will take place sometime next week, at a time to be announced later. Please keep in mind that corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved. <p>Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message Forum available via www.everquest.com.<p>- The EverQuest Team<br> <br>

		<EM><br>SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT ACQUIRES<br>ONLINE GAMING COMPANY VERANT INTERACTIVE &<br>APPOINTS KELLY FLOCK AS PRESIDENT & CEO OF<br>SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT (SOE)<p>Verant Becomes Part Of SOE As Sony Pictures Entertainment<br>Takes Steps To Strengthen Its Interactive Gaming Leadership Position<p>CULVER CITY, CA, May 31, 2000-Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) announced<br>today it has acquired the online games company Verant Interactive, Inc. and<br>named prominent digital gaming executive Kelly Flock as president and CEO of<br>Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) to bolster SOE's position as the dominant<br>cyber-destination for interactive game enthusiasts.<p>Verant, a San Diego-based development studio that creates and markets<br>cutting-edge online games, will be merged into SOE as part of SOE's effort<br>to concentrate on becoming the premier attraction for interactive gaming<br>enthusiasts from its new San Diego headquarters. With a staff of more than<br>150 software developers, Verant has been responsible for operating the<br>popular online games EverQuest®, TanarusT and SovereignT. Verant President<br>John Smedley will remain with SOE as executive vice president and chief<br>operating officer.<p>Mr. Flock will supervise the development of engaging new interactive games<br>by SOE and Verant, and will oversee SOE's award-winning Web site, the<br>Station@sony.com, which features EverQuest, the top-selling online PC game<br>title, and such popular attractions for non-paying, casual users as Wheel of<br>Fortune, JEOPARDY! and Trivial Pursuit Online.<p>Yair Landau, president of SPE's recently created Sony Pictures Digital<br>Entertainment (SPDE) unit, which includes SOE, said the acquisition of<br>privately-held Verant and Mr. Flock's appointment reinforces SPE's<br>determination to fortify its online businesses and enable SOE to deliver the<br>most exciting, cutting-edge, network gaming to interactive consumers.<p>In Mr. Flock's previous role as president of the interactive game company<br>989 Studios, he oversaw the rapid growth of EverQuest into an interactive<br>gaming powerhouse. Under his supervision, EverQuest broke all<br>subscription-based online gaming sales records, reaching more than 250,000<br>paid subscribers and 350,000 units sold. During peak periods online, more<br>than 60,000 people can play EverQuest simultaneously, acting as adventurers<br>and dragon slayers in cyberspace. Average playing time per player is about<br>20 hours a week.<p>"As the pre-eminent executive in the interactive gaming community, Kelly<br>Flock is perfectly suited to build on Sony Online Entertainment's leadership<br>position and lift it to new levels of excellence," said Howard Stringer,<br>chairman and CEO of Sony Corporation of America (SCA). "With all of his<br>wonderful skills, talent and creativity, we're delighted that Kelly will<br>continue to work his digital magic in the extended Sony family."<p>"We're delighted to welcome Verant and Kelly into the fold at a time when<br>interactive gaming is an increasingly important part of our business<br>portfolio," said Mel Harris, co-president and chief operating officer for<br>Sony Pictures Entertainment. "Considering that consumers worldwide spent<br>nearly $7 billion on computer games last year, we look to Kelly and his team<br>at SOE to broaden our base and make us a pre-eminent force in this<br>fast-growing business."<p>"The acquisition of Verant is a very natural fit for us, considering the way<br>our companies have worked together on games like Everquest. And, we've been<br>very interested in having Kelly join us for some time," Mr. Landau said.<br>"Kelly is a world-class executive who commands enormous respect in the<br>interactive gaming universe. As we focus more and more on SOE becoming a<br>pure gaming company, we're pleased to bring aboard both a high-profile<br>industry leader like Kelly and to acquire an innovative gaming leader in<br>Verant to oversee both our 'casual' gaming, led by such tent-pole properties<br>as Wheel of Fortune and JEOPARDY!, and our pay programming led by the<br>hot-selling EverQuest."<p>"I continue to believe that online gaming is the fastest-growing, most excit<br>ing area of interactive entertainment," Mr. Flock said. "It is a great<br>honor to be able to rejoin the pioneers at SOE and the EverQuest development<br>teams, under John Smedly's direction at Verant, in furthering our goal of<br>facilitating the next evolution in games. Sony Online Entertainment has the<br>edge in technology and content, and I am excited by the opportunity to<br>create and lead the next mass-market category of gaming."<p>The appointment of Mr. Flock, a longtime Sony executive, as president of SOE<br>coincides with a shift in emphasis and location for the interactive gaming<br>concern. The company has sharpened its focus on SOE as a creator and<br>distributor of all kinds of networked gaming, and has moved its headquarters<br>from New York to San Diego, where Mr. Flock will be based.<p>Mr. Flock was appointed president of Sony Imagesoft in March 1995.<br>Imagesoft evolved into Sony Computer Entertainment America's (SCEA's) sole<br>North American development studio before launching as 989 StudiosT, an SCEA<br>wholly-owned independent PlayStation publisher, in April 1998. In that<br>position, he was responsible for day-to-day operations of the<br>cross-platform, multimedia entertainment software company and reported<br>directly to Ken Kutaragi, the chairman and chief executive officer of Sony<br>Computer Entertainment America, Inc., who was recently named to the Board of<br>Directors of Tokyo-based Sony Corporation.<p>Before joining Sony, Mr. Flock held various senior executive positions at<br>LucasArts Entertainment Company and other interactive entertainment<br>companies, including Electronic Arts and Activision. During his tenure with<br>LucasArts Entertainment Company, the company emerged as one of the leading<br>CD-ROM publishers in the industry. He obtained his B.A. in English<br>literature from San Francisco State University.<p><br>About Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment<p>Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment (SPDE), an operating unit of Sony<br>Pictures<br>Entertainment (SPE), oversees the activities of SPE's digital production and<br>online<br>assets which include Sony Pictures Imageworks, Sony Online Entertainment and<br>Columbia Tri-Star Interactive. SPDE focuses on three areas: 1) producing<br>and developing<br>visual effects and computer-generated imaging (CGI), digital character<br>animation, and<br>original content for motion picture, television, online and PlayStation<br>audiences; 2) tapping<br>SPE's film and television libraries and its talent relationships to develop<br>new forms of online<br>content, games and interactive programming; and 3) leading SPE's efforts to<br>provide<br>video-on-demand, interactive television and the distribution of other forms<br>of digital content<br>and services over the emerging broadband networks.<p>About Sony Pictures Entertainment<p>Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is a division of Sony Corporation of<br>America (SCA), a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Sony Corporation.

		<EM><br>May 25th, 8:00am<br>--------------------<p>*Patch Day*<p>Greetings all!  The following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<p>*Spells/Songs*<p>- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly saving versus resistance to cold.  It now appropriately saves versus magic.<br>- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target instead of damaging it.  This has been corrected.<p>*Items*<p>The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its weight decreased substantially.<p>The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has been restricted to Monks only.  The statistics on this staff are much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors.  This change is retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory.  Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change necessary.  We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.<p>A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report "Item out of charges", has been corrected.  Due to the dynamics of this particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out for a new, properly working version of the item.<p>The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced.  In addition to an increase in statistics, it has received a stronger spell effect.  The lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be "sneaky" :)<p>The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.<p>*General Changes*<p>- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level.  They have been adjusted.<br>- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep.  NPCs and pets should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.<br>- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These issues have been corrected.<br>- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance of Research have been corrected.  All practice-rune recipes should now work correctly.<br>- Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly reflects their undead status.<br>- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.<br>- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.<br>- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed to start their character in Cabilis.  They were never actually allowed to create the character there, however the indication that they could has been fixed.<br>- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in certain cases.<p>We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which music does not currently work.  There are 55 small files (around 2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of the affected zones.  <p>The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized.  Certain aspects of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the reward should be well worth the risk.  Feel free to visit this zone and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on Monday.<p>Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons).  The affected zones have been updated, and adventurers should notice the greater experience reward in return for the increased risk and challenge associated with these zones.<p>- The EverQuest Team<br></EM>

		 I was just recently looking through the many sites for EQ, when I found one of a very reliable source. The site said the new Kunark Dungeons had given a little less XP (experience points) than Dungeons of an equal level. Not only has this little problem been promised to be fixed, but due to the difficulty of the Kunark Dungeons they will now give a little bit more XP than dungeons of an equal level (or a bit higher). Just another reason to go out and buy RoK. Happy Hunting  All. =)<p>LONG LIVE DARKIES!
