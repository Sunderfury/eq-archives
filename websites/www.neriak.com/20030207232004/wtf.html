So what happened to the old Neriak.COM?  Well, in short, we no longer had
any time to update it.  The site was still receiving a lot of hits, and
people were still coming, but we hadn't updated in over a year.  No one was
sending material in for us to post, and we can't write everything ourselves. 
Add to that the 10-20 pieces of complaining emails we got each week saying
&quot;waaa waaa when are you gonna add new stuff?&quot;.  So we took it down

BUT, rather than let the domain expire and get gobbled up by some damn
domain hoarder, we're keeping it.  Nyah.

There is a chance, though, that we'll be putting the old essays and stories
back online in an unsorted format at some point.
