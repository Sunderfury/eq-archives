The Face Behind the Mask: Book II
</P>

<P>
Welcome yet again, my colleague.
</P>

<P>
As more history do you desire of our Hall, then more history shall you 
receive.
</P>

<P>
So grant me again the loan of your ears and your heart for a time, my 
fellow rogue, and we shall continue our journey along this heady saga of 
blood and shadows...
</P>

<P>
Of the Fall of The Old Empire
</P>

<P>
Imperatrix Zhelebati Thex the Avenger sat upon the Bloodstone Throne for 
but twoscore and eight winters, not half enough for the Empire to regain its 
former glory.  Upon a visit to the Tunarian outpost of Wielle,  her ship and 
all aboard her (including her bodyguard and friend Dencarja V`ree) 
mysteriously vanished, never to be seen or heard from ever again.  Our finest 
sorcerors strove beyond the limits of their arcane arts, but could not find 
them in the either the realms of the living or the unliving.  Of course, 
treachery was suspected.  Treachery is ever suspected among our kind.  House 
V`ree especially cast a baleful eye towards her young son, Kel'anthinstion, 
who seemed in his youth better molded by his thrice-damnable grandsire than 
his noble mother.  But House V`ree could prove nothing, and we watched with 
unease as Kel'anthinstion became Imperator. 
</P>

<P>
And yet it would be not Kel'anthinstion Thex who would sound the death 
knell of the Empire, but the gods themselves.
</P>

<P>
We could never have dreamed that the gods would initiate what would lead 
to the destruction of the Empire, and nearly our own extinction as well.  
Perhaps They themselves knew not the repercussions of Their actions, perhaps 
They did.  Either way, I doubt They would have cared.  Such is the nature of 
the gods, I fear.  
</P>

<P>
This was the dawn of what is now known as the Lost Age.  The so-called 
elves of light and their treeloving wild brethren had long occupied the huge 
forests of the southeastern quarter of the continent Tunaria, which the 
Humans have since renamed Antonica.  We knew they had cities built high into 
the trees and a marble metropolis in the forest's clearings and meadows.  
Their white towers stretched to the sky in pale imitation of our own majestic 
indigo spires.  But they found the curse of the gods upon them.  Solusek Ro, 
may Innoruuk quench His cursed Eternal Fires, yawned and stretched within His 
burning lair in the Eye of Solusek, arching the spine of the Serpent 
Mountains.  Heat, long unknown, came to the ancient forests of the Pale Ones. 
</P>

<P>
The rivers ran dry, and rain was felt less every season.  The druids of the 
Pale Ones fought mightily with magicks natural and arcane but they could not 
halt the inevitable. They wept bitterly as their forest died and was replaced 
by a vast desert of endless shifting sands.  The newborn Desert of Ro swept 
over their entire realm, and their once-tall city of Takish-Hiz became a dead 
thing indeed, the capital city of a kingdom of dust.  The Pale Ones despaired 
over the loss of their homes, marked well the might of the Ogres of the 
South, and then did the unthinkable.
</P>

<P>
They turned their desperate and greedy eyes to Faydwer.  
</P>

<P>
To the Empire.
</P>

<P>
Most of our operatives in Tunaria had long since returned to Faydwer to 
assist in the rebuilding of the House following the War of Assassins.  Thus, 
a mere handful of us remained at our Tunarian outposts.  It was in the third 
summer of the reign of Imperator Kel'anthinstion Thex that our outpost of 
Wielle, located where the city of Freeport stands today, was taken and 
destroyed by the forces of the Pale Ones.  They were beating at our gates, 
having crossed the Ocean of Tears in our own fleet of tall ships, before we 
were even aware of them.
</P>

<P>
What followed thereafter was war ... two centuries of entrenched battles, 
each equally matched side capturing or yielding perhaps a yard or two of 
territory every season.  The very soil of the continent grew soaked in the 
precious lifeblood of fallen Elves.  Indeed, the mighty Faydark Forest is a 
result of this vast bloodletting, for it blossomed and flourished upon such 
matchless nourishment.  
</P>

<P>
The War ended with the Battle of Aerignon.  The province of Aerignon was 
the site of the headquarters of the Pale Ones.  The Imperator Kel'anthinstion 
Thex targeted it for obliteration and gathered the best of the imperial 
forces to carry out that desire.  To his credit and his folly, he chose to 
lead the attack itself, in the expectation of breaking the back of the Pale 
Ones once and for all time.  The Imperator, who during the two centuries of 
warfare had shed his wastrel ways and had forged himself into a most noble 
and capable leader, soon had the enemy forces completely encircled.  Escape 
was impossible and our necromancers fairly danced with bloodlust for the 
carnage which was to come.  After all, was not victory assured?
</P>

<P>
Alas, it was not.
</P>

<P>
Not in the damnable least.
</P>

<P>
Forgive me the angry tremors of my voice, my colleague.  I know well that 
this all happened a very long time ago, before even I was born.  
Nevertheless, our loss is still a source of great pain to us, a source of 
shame, and fuel for our Hate.  My grandsire was but a boy when it all 
happened, and all the days of his life were spent in teaching his family 
never to forget what we once were and what we would again be, once we became 
strong enough to avenge ourselves.
</P>

<P>
But I digress from our topic.  Our undoing at the Battle of Aerignon.
</P>

<P>
Unknown to our forces that day, a group of the Pale Ones' wild brethren, 
the so-called &quot;wood elves&quot; had that hour returned from a scouting foray and 
found themselves behind the main imperial command group.  In an unheard of 
display of self-sacrifice, all but one leaped into the camp, their warcries 
alerting all within.  The last of them used the distraction the others had 
provided to slip undisturbed into the Imperator's tent.  The Imperator was in 
the process of donning his battle armor and the wood elf (may his 
treeworshipping soul be burned forever and a sevenday by the terrible chill 
of the Abyss) plunged his cowardly dagger into the Imperator's unprotected 
back.   The tent shook with the bellow of rage which burst forth from the 
lips of Kel'anthinstion Thex.  The dagger in his back snapped like a dried 
twig as he whirled to face his craven assassin.  With both hands he grasped 
the head of the wood elf and squeezed with the last of his strength.  The 
awful crack of the cursed elf's skull giving way to those powerful fingers 
heralded the vengeance of Kel'anthinstion Thex and the doom of the Empire.
</P>

<P>
Thus fell Kel'anthinstion Thex, last of the royal house of Thex.
</P>

<P>
Thus died the Undying Dynasty.
</P>

<P>
The howl of hatred fairly rent the continent when the Imperator's body 
was discovered.  Our forces were blinded by their hate and were lost.  
Remember this lesson well, o my colleague, for it will preserve your life and 
end that of your enemies: Hate is our legacy and the fuel in our veins.  It 
is a beast we direct at others.  It is also a very poor leader.  Never permit 
it to control you, for it will blind you to subtleties and stratagems and 
lead only to your demise.  Therefore did our forces, drunk on their hate, 
surrender themselves to the bane we call the Killing Fury.  The field of 
Aerignon became a marsh of blood upon that fateful day, as our forces killed 
many but perished to a man.
</P>

<P>
Except for one, that is: an operative of House V'ree attached to the 
Imperial Command Group.  He saw what was to come and knew he could do nothing 
to prevent it, so he abandoned the battlefield to warn the capital.  Because 
of his wisdom we were able to mobilize what was left of our forces and slow 
the advance of the Pale Ones for what would be the next ten winters.
</P>

<P>
Ultimately, the end did come.  Caerthiel, our once-indomitable capital, 
was all that remained of our shattered Empire.  We held onto life behind its 
battered walls, defiant to the end, and awaited the final assault which would 
surely doom our people and wipe them from the face of Norrath forever.  Or so 
we thought.
</P>

<P>
I cannot tell you the name of our savior, for his name changes with every 
telling of the history.  All we know for certain is that he was a very young 
priest of Innoruuk, scarcely in his fortieth winter.  But Innoruuk was with 
him, and he rallied the Teir`dal to his banner.  For seven days did he pray, 
his slender body trembling with rage, and seven times did he curse the souls 
of the Pale Ones and their Wild Brethren.  Finally, his indigo cheeks 
streaked with tears of blood, the young priest drove his staff of office into 
the earth.
</P>

<P>
And the earth opened before him, a huge chasm of darkness as deep as the 
Abyss itself.  &quot;Behold our salvation!&quot; the priest then thundered.  &quot;Gather 
your belongings and follow me to sanctuary and life!&quot;
</P>

<P>
And we did, o my colleague.  In the span of a day we gathered all that we 
could, all that we dared, and followed the priest into the chasm that 
Innoruuk gave unto him.  All of our knowledge, what remained of our magick 
and treasures did we take with us.  Only one thing could we not save: the 
Bloodstone Throne in the Imperial Palace.  Shaped by magick from a single, 
massive gemstone, it could not neither be taken with us nor left behind for 
the Pale Ones to desecrate.  Therefore did we smash it to bits, and we wept 
tears of anger at our enemies as we so did (a shard of the Throne remains in 
our keeping, fellow rogue.  A gleaming memory of a matchless, all but 
forgotten might).  That done, we shook our fists a final time at our ravening 
foes and entered the chasm, which closed magickally behind us.
</P>

<P>
The city walls fell to the Pale Ones the next morning.  I can only 
magine their surprise at seeing the  lifeless husk of the city they had won. 
</P>

<P>
They razed it to the ground, you know.  Utterly destroyed it in their 
impotent fury.  And they did build their marble city of Felwithe upon the 
very site where Kel'anthinstion Thex was so foully murdered.
</P>

<P>
Damned forever be the souls of the Pale Ones and their Wild Brethren, who 
brought us Pain and Exile.
</P>

<P>
Praised be to the memory of our Nameless Savior, who delivered us from 
Death.
</P>

<P>
Of the Rebuilding
</P>

<P>
And what of us, you ask?  We walked with our savior for what seemed to be 
an eternity within the endless stretch of darkness of the chasm.  The weak 
died, and many were born during this our Flight of Fury, and they grew more 
and more attuned to the black depths which surrounded us.  We could soon see 
in it as others could see at twillight.  Not even the Dwarven people were 
better suited to living in blessed darkness as we had now become.  When 
Innoruuk felt we had suffered enough, He opened the chasm once more and we 
found ourselves on the continent of Tunaria, in what we would call our 
beloved Nektulos, the Forest of Eternal Night.
</P>

<P>
We had learned our lessons well in the chasm.  We had to insure our 
survival before all things, and rebuild our power until we could revenge 
ourselves on the hated Pale Ones for driving us from Faydwer.  Thus, our new 
city had to be hidden from the prying eyes of others, and a stronghold 
impervious to attack.  We knew from our wretched experience that we could not 
build upon open ground.  Then we looked to the mountains on the rim of the 
Forest ... and we smiled.
</P>

<P>
It took a century.
</P>

<P>
In darkness, in secret, did we who remained of the Teir`Dal carve this 
city of Neriak, our &quot;Dark Sanctuary.&quot;   And know that we of House V`ree 
toiled under the mountains alongside our people.  At the direction of 
Guildmistress Etacherni V`ree (who had become Guildmistress during the our 
Flight in the chasm) did we set our clever hands, trained to quickness and 
death, to become soiled and callused in the work of creation as we helped to 
hew a great city into the honest rock beneath the grey mountains.  Therefore 
did the Teir`Dal carve this wondrous realm for ourselves, strong and safe and 
such that the Dwarves themselves would weep with pleasure if they could 
behold the dark beauty that is Neriak.  And House V`ree crafted in Neriak its 
new home, and called it the Hall of the Ebon Mask.  We set it into the most 
defensible part of the city, and adorned it with statues of the matchless 
Nogras V`ree and his worthy son Kard the Crafty.  All that Caerthiel had been 
was rebuilt except for one thing: the Imperial Palace.  After all, the line 
of Thex was no more and the Bloodstone Throne had been destroyed.  Moreover, 
despite the wishes of the people, our savior refused to be named king.  
Instead, the priest of Innoruuk prophesied that, while an Empire would rise 
anew from the ashes of the old, he was not the one to found such a reign.  
Still, as we desperately needed his guidance, he allowed the Teir`Dal to name 
him Regent of Neriak. 
</P>

<P>
The Regent was wise in the nature of his people.  We were weary from our 
toils and weakened by our great losses during the Flight.  We needed time to 
grow powerful and confident again.  Therefore did the Regent set the guilds 
to rebuild themselves to their earlier glories, providing advice and 
inspiration but sparingly, lest they grow dependent upon him for all things.  
All that we did, the Regent constantly reminded us, was in service to the 
Empire to come, to the future Throne to be.  As he held the power of the 
Regency, so were all guilds acting in the name of the ruler to come.  We 
listened and learned and mourned when, but three centuries later, the Regent 
died, his struggle to make the Teir`Dal strong enough to survive having been 
completed.
</P>

<P>
And we were.  We stood tall and proud on the night when we revealed our 
presence to the world.  The Teir`Dal had returned, we told the races of 
Norrath, and let those foolish enough to still seek our demise despair of 
their immortal souls.
</P>

<P>
Upon the death of the Regent, a strange thing happened.  Three centuries 
of independence had taken effect: the guilds, having governed themselves for 
so long, were most content to remain so doing. Older guilds, to be sure, 
maintained that they wielded power in trust for the Imperator to come, but 
the result was the same: we had become rulers in our own right.  And we did 
create guarded alliances between ourselves and the other guilds, lest civil 
war destroy what the Pale Ones did not.  That is why we here in Neriak in 
fact govern ourselves, with no king or queen to rule as sovereign over us.
</P>

<P>
What is it you ask of me?  What of the pretenders?
</P>

<P>
Ah, my young colleague, that has become something ever more unknown these 
nights.
</P>

<P>
You know as well as I do that two Teir`Dal have in the past half century 
made claim to the Throne of our People: Aythox and Cristianos.  Both of them 
dare to usurp the royal surname of Thex, and both have gathered several 
followers to their banners.  Few see them, however; certainly no one in the 
last decade or so.  Indeed, they have become the stuff of Teir`Dal legend, 
two Dark Elves eternally at war with one another in a shadowy campaign, 
neither ever winning.  Many now doubt that they ever existed at all.  So as 
to the future of the Throne ... we shall see what we see when we see it.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Praise be to Nektulos, our blessed Forest of Eternal Night.
    Praise be to Neriak, the Dark Sanctuary, our home.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Of the Faithless and the Mischievites
</P>

<P>
I need not tell you that the hearts of our people were affected by our 
Flight.  Many felt that the fall of the Empire was nothing less than the 
betrayal of the Teir`Dal by Father Innoruuk and rejected Him outright.  Some 
of these Teir`Dal chose other gods to worship.  Many warriors, for example, 
chose the Warlord Rallos Zek, believing that the power of War was stronger 
than that of Hate.  Others instead cast aside all gods entirely, holding that 
it were better to rely on oneself alone than on the whims of very often 
fickle deities.  These self -styled agnostics we know as the Faithless.  Yes, 
heresy had taken root in the hearts of our people, and we watched with dread 
when even House V`ree failed to prove itself immune to infection.
</P>

<P>
The terrible truth was, many of our brethren within the Hall of the Ebon 
Mask had in fact abandoned Innoruuk.  Several became Faithless, and a small 
group deep within House V`ree chose to worship Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, 
sharing His hedonistic delight in complex schemes and larceny.  Heresy 
abounded and it troubled Guildmistress Etacherni V`ree, who saw with alarm 
dark clouds again marking the eventual doom of House V`ree.
</P>

<P>
She pondered this dilemma for seven sevendays, seeking the solution in 
the musty tomes of the archives, which contained the collected wisdom of all 
of the previous guildmasters.  In the end, it was in the ancient words of 
Kard V`ree that Etacherni found the answer she had sought.  Millennia ago, 
Kard the Crafty had saved House V`ree from extinction by recruiting outside 
the all but vanished V`ree bloodline.  His argument had been simple: &quot;What 
is blood,&quot; he had asked of his detractors, &quot;Compared to ability and fealty?  
The House must do what it must to survive and prosper.&quot;  Etacherni had known 
many of the heretics since childhood.  They were no less talented and no less 
loyal to House V`ree, regardless of their beliefs.  As Guildmistress, she was 
charged with the life and success of the House, a House greatly diminished 
after the Flight.  Reality must needs win out over ideology.  Thus did 
Etacherni V`ree allow the heretics to remain and in fact recruited others.  
Our ranks again swelled and House V`ree was saved yet a second time.
</P>

<P>
Moreover, unforeseen benefits arose from the admission of the heretics:  
The Faithless were matchless spies and couriers, their presence actually 
tolerated in the many foreign cities we had begun to infiltrate.  As for the 
Mischievites, their propensities towards thievery brought a stream of riches 
to flow into the House proper.  At first, Etacherni V`ree merely tolerated 
the benefits of this spearhead of crime.  Soon, however, she marked well the 
benefits of wealth and power which crime offered.  Her acceptance led to open 
support, and her support led to the organization of crime itself.  In time, 
House V`ree became more than the source of the finest assassins and spies 
Norrath had ever known; we became an extralegal power the likes of which 
Norrath had never before seen.  The Hall of the Ebon Mask became not unlike a 
dark spider, the strands of our webs reaching to the farthest shores of the 
world, not merely providing us with useful intelligence, but also with a not 
insignificant degree of actual control over several of the financial and 
political arenas in almost every city on Norrath.
</P>

<P>
So remember this, o my colleague: While they are indeed lost souls, the 
heretics are yet your brothers and sisters within the shadows of V`ree.  From 
Master Hekzin G`Zule to the impudent Szardos, they are our Eyes and Ears and 
Hands, our equals in darkness.  
</P>

    Praise be to the memory of Etacherni V`ree, First Guildmistress of Neriak.
    Praise be to the memory of Etacherni the Practical, she we call the Third 
Founder of House V`ree.

    Thus is our earliest history revealed unto you, fellow rogue.  
    Perhaps, in future, I shall tell you of our history here in Antonica.
