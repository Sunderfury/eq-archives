Drop after drop of cold water dripped from the branches above, splattering on Crester’s long silver hair, running in chilly rivulets down his back, making his dark skin damp and itchy under his leather armour.  The rain had been falling for days now and the wind that drove it brought an icy hint of winter.  Crester huddled in his sodden cloak under the sheltering boughs of  a great pine, seeking some kind of refuge from the elements, his mood as dark and brooding as the gloomy clouds above.  For three days now he had wandered through these dark woods,  running from his hunters and his past in equal measure.  He was cold, hungry, and exhausted.  The thought brought a bitter smile to his lips.  “Hate is an inner fire, it will make you strong when you are weak, warm you when you are chilled, and give you sustenance when you hunger.”  Such were the words that the Clerics of Innoruuk spouted to him in the Lodge of the Dead. Once he had believed those words, held the hate within him and sought to spread its wicked perfection.  But now his hatred was gone, faded away and left nothing in its place but guilt and despair.

Crester had been given over to the Lodge as a child, A priest of Innoruuk had recognized his potential for arts both martial and eldritch and taken him to live with the other alcolytes in the service of Hate.  He had grown and matured under that severe tutelage, showing great promise as a warrior and some talent with magick.  Upon reaching adulthood he was inducted into the ranks of the Shadow Knights and they continued with his education.  All of this had been much to his liking.  While life with the Priests of Innoruuk had been harsh at times, it also brought respect from the other denizens of Neriak.  Everyone treated you with deference and even a hint of fear.  This treatment and honored position among the Teir’Dal was ample payment for the difficulty of his training.  And as a young Shadow Knight the privileges were even greater.  Even the city guards would give you a wide berth, no one within Neriak would dare question your actions or tell you nay.  When not training you could indulge in all the best the great underground city had to offer, the finest wines, the richest foods, the most beautiful and skillful of women.  Life for those elite apostles of Hate was entertaining to say the least.

Of course the pleasures he enjoyed were not without their price.  The armsmaster was merciless, using pain as a weapon to drive home every mistake he made, and rewarding his victories with nought but sneers and insults.  The necromancers were no different and the anguish they could inflict on his mind rivaled any pain that the weapons trainers could  mete out on his body.  However Crester was stubborn and proud, too much so to ever let them make him quit or see his pain.  He learned the use of spear, sword, and shield, tactics and strategy, all the arts of war and death.  Crester excelled at combat, quickly surpassing his peers in martial ability.  The gift of magic was his as well, though not he did not excel at it as he did at melee.  From the Necromancers of the Lodge he learned the dark secrets of their eldritch art such as he could master.  And from Ulraz S’lon he learned the thing that set the Shadow Knights apart from all others, the Harm Touch.  
</P>

<P>
Eventually his training came to its end and it was time for him to earn his place within the Lodge.  He had to prove his ability and worth, so he set out to do so with a vengenace.  The tasks were simple to begin with, almost insulting to one of his ability.  He ventured into the Nektulous Forest, a grim and dangerous place that shielded Neriak’s entance as surely as its guards.  There he hunted the fire beetles that were greater in stature than large dogs and with a disposition that could rival that of any troll.  The Lodge wanted their eyes, for what he never knew nor cared, he only knew that it was what his superiors requested he find.  Fire beetle eyes, spider venom, bone chips from the undead that infested the forest.  All of these they sent him to collect, and despite the danger he succeeded.  After a time, when the elders of the Lodge had come to know of him and his abilities they decided that it was time to assign him a real task as a test of his mettle. 
</P>

<P>
The day that Loveal S’Nez summoned him into his study at the Lodge was the beginning of the end.  Loveal charged Crester with travelling to the desolate Lavastorm Mountains North of Neriak to hunt down and slay a paladin by the name of Sir Lindal.  According to Loveal the cursed paladin was responsible for disrunpting a communication line between Neriak and some undisclosed destination, and Crester could prove his loyalty to the Lodge by bringing them proof of Sir Lindal’s untimely demise.  Crester left the study, smiling to himself, finally a task worthy of his ability, dispatching one of the holier than though paladins that strutted across the land smug in their own goodness, would be both pleasing and profitable.  The journey to the Lavastorm Mountains was easy, it was not far from Neriak and there was little within the  Nektulous forest that would dare trouble him.  The task was to prove more troublesome than expected though.  The Lavastorms, true to their name were viciously hot, geysers of steam spewed from the ground and pools of bubbling lava dotted the desolate landscape.  All manner of dangerous creatures roamed the area, magical beasts that could live in the heat and clouds of choking sulfur.  Crester spent days trudging over the burning rocks, smoke coming from his boots, sweat pouring from him until he could sweat no more, his skin searing and cracking.  And never could he rest for at every turn fire imps and elementals roamed, waiting for the foolish and unwary to wander into their path.  
</P>

<P>
By the third day of his search he was beginning to doubt his ability to complete the quest.  His water was gone and he was exhausted and sick with heat and thirst.  Each step on his hot blistered feet was an agony and his muscles protested with each movement.  As he stumbled over another ridge of jagged rock he came face to face with a hideous creature.  A red skinned being, with leathery bat like wings and horns sprouting from its gnarled hate filled face had sprung up before him.  Before Crester had time to recover from his surprise the fire imp was on him, slashing with its jagged claws and savaging him with its cruel yellow fangs.  Worn as he was his training served him well.  Bashing the imp with his shield he knocked it back far enough to bring his spear into action, stabbing at the beast with its well honed point.  The battle was a flurry of activity and Crester was bleeding from many wounds, but the imp bled from more, its blood bubling and sizzling as Crester’s darting spear spilled it on the smoldering ground.  Just as he was poised to deliver the fatal thrust the imp made a hideous screeching noise and flames burst up around him, blinding him and forcing him to his knees in anguish.  He knew that it was over for him , he had failed in his task and would die alone in this desolate place and no one would mourn his passing.  His last thoughts were of the laughter that would echo in the halls of the Lodge when Lovel S’Nez learned of his death.
</P>

<P>
Slowly Crester became aware of a low chanting sound.  It was strangely soothing to his ears though he didn’t understand the words themselves.  For a moment he believed that death had indeed claimed him and this was some paradisical afterlife, though why he would end up in paradise after failing in his service to Innoruuk was beyond him.  However as his mind cleared and he came fully awake he came to realize that by some miracle he was indeed still alive.  Their was pain throughout his body, though it was nothing compared to the suffering he had experienced when the fire imp had called forth the flames.  He seemed to be in a sheltered cave, that while still warm, was much cooler than the world outside had been, if he was still in the Lavastorm Mountains as he assumed.  As quietly as he could he turned his head, wishing to survey his surroundings before alerting anyone or anything that might be nearby to the fact that he was awake.  He was in a cave, and a fairly small one at that.  He was lying on a small cot in the back.  A small amount of light came from a crystal orb nestled in an outcrop of rock near the ceiling.  His weapons and armour were piled neatly beside the cot, well within his reach.  A tall figure was kneeling with his back to him, this was the source of the chanting.  The chanting man bore the robes of a priest, adorned with the holy symbol of Mithaniel Marr, the favored diety of the whining warriors of light throughout the land.  The priestly robes did not conceal the rippling muscles of the mans arms and shoulders, and a pile of shining armour was stacked in the far corner.  Realization came to Crester, this was the man he had come to kill. 
</P>

<P>
Crester eased himself out of bed, noticing that his wounds had been bandaged and his burns were nearly healed.  Why a paladin of Mithaniel Marr would bother to heal a Teir’Dal shadowknight was beyond him, but it mattered little.  Using his elven stealth he quietly picked up his spear and moved towards Sir Lindal’s unprotected back.  It would be quick and easy, a spear thrust to the back followed by the Harm Touch, the paladin would be dead and he could return triumphant to the Lodge for his reward.  He was poised for the strike, the glittering spearpoint quivering in the air, ready to be driven into Sir Lindal’s back.  To his own amazement he hesitated, he could not bring himself to attack this man, the man that had obviously rescued him and healed his wounds.  He could hear the words of the priests of Innoruuk in his mind, telling him that  the man’s kindness was nothing but a weakness to be exploited, there was no honor, only victory.  And yet his hands now shook as he tried to make himself drive the spear home.  After an eternity of private struggle he slowly lowered the spear, he would not kill the man like this. 
</P>

<P>
“Why do you not strike?”, the man siad without standing or turning.  How he was aware of Crester’s intended attack he could not tell, and why he had not moved to defend himself was a greater mystery yet.
</P>

<P>
“I simply can not.”  Crester tossed down the his weapon, disgusted with himself, though he could not say if it was for planning to attack the man or for not carrying through with it.  The paladin stood and turned to face him.  
</P>

<P>
“I see that I guessed correctly, there is the spark of goodness within you, albeit buried deep, but there nonetheless.”  Sir Lindal offered Crester a flask which he took and drank deeply of the cool water within.  There was no reason to fear poisoning from a  man that had saved his life already.  “I have watched you as you searched these mountains, I assume for me.  The Lodge has sent others before to dispatch me, and most have fallen to the dangers of this realm.  A few have managed to find me and have fallen to the might of Mithaniel Marr.”
</P>

<P>
“Why did you not let me die then, if you knew I came to kill you?” Crester asked.  Sir Lindal shrugged.
</P>

<P>
“I am not really sure myself, only that I grow weary of killing.  Perhaps it was a revelation from my God, perhaps only intuition.  I only know I found myself moved to save you, and after I did I felt that you would not harm me. “  A smile of genuine good humor crossed the the Paladin’s face.  “Fortunately I was right.”  Crester could not return the smile.  He felt very small in petty in the face of this man’s good and trusting nature.  And yet an ember of anger and irritation smoldered deep wtihin him.  He had failed, and now only lived on the whim of one whose kind he loathed.  Now he owed something to one of these pathetic followers of the light.  He turned from the man and began pulling on his armor.  Sir Lindal said nothing as he did so, merely stood and watched in silence.  When Crester finished donning his armor he strode past where Lindal stood and headed for what he presumed to be the mouth of the cave.  
</P>

<P>
“Be well friend”, Sir Lindal said, placing a hand on Crester’s shoulder as he passed.   Crester turned and met his eyes.
</P>

<P>
“I am not your friend.”  He shrugged the hand off his shoulder and made his way out of the cave back into the hostile land beyond.  He made the journey back to Neriak, trying to drive the memory of the incident with the paladin out of his mind.  Not only he had failed, but he had spared the life of the one he had been sent to kill.  Did he act out of gratitude for his own life, out of mercy, out of some strange sense of honor?  He still couldn’t understand why he had done it.  
</P>

<P>
The return to the Lodge was not pleasant.  He went to Loveal S’Nez and told him that he had not found the paladin and had finally been driven from the mountains by fire imps.  Loveal had sneered and oredered Crester to report to the Master of Novices to be assigned some “tasks” more in line with his abilities.  For the next several months he had performed the most menial and revolting of duties as did all novices.  The Lodge had little sympathy for failure.  
</P>

<P>
One day as he went about cleaning  the lower level of the Lodge, the place where the members of the Dead came to perform their grisly experiments, Juneal D’Seth, one of the younger shadowknights to have the respect of the Lodge Elders,  entered the chamber followed by two alcolytes carrying a struggling halfling woman between them.  Juneal ignored Crester as he had since his failure.  He instructed the alcolytes to shackle the terrified woman to the wall of the chamber.  The halfing’s eyes were wide with terror, and she thrashed violently as her gaze took in the instruments of torture that were arrayed around the chamber and the ghastly remains of  previous victims.  Crester stared at the desperate creature, the stirring of feelings he had never known before swelling within him.  Why the site of this frightened helpless halfling would affect him he could not understand.  Anyone of any of the light races that fell into the hands of the Tier’Dal were doomed to die, usually in great pain and fear.   The members of the Lodge often used captives for their necromantic experiements and sometimes for their own dark amusement.  Screams were common from the lower levels of the Lodge and condidered the purest music by many of its members.  Crester had lived with the sounds of fear and suffering since he was a child and had never been disturbed.   But now he felt a growing sense of revulsion, what had this poor woman done to deserve the torment she was certain to receive.  Somehow she must have sensed how he felt, for her gaze met his and she quieted for a moment, a tiny glimmer of hope bringing her back from the edge of madness.  Her lips formed the word “please” as she desperately sought an ally, an escape from the terror.   
</P>

<P>
A sharp blow to the side of his face caused Crester to stagger. 
</P>

<P>
“Out you weak willed fool” Juneal D’Seth shouted as he rained blows down on Crester’s head.   “Out of my sight you pathetic worm, there is man’s work to be done here.”  Crester stumbled from the room in shock and confusion.  Why did he care about this halfing’s fate,  was what Sir Lindal had said about the spark of goodness within him true? 
</P>

<P>
It wasn’t much longer until the screams began.  At first they were merely shrieks of fear as the poor woman gave into her  despair,  but it was not long until they had transformed into howls of agony.  Crester ran down the hall and up the stairs, trying to get away from the terrible cries, each one wrenching a place in his heart he had not known existed.  Recklessly pushing apprentices out of his way he made his way to his small cold room.  Even there he could hear her though, screaming and begging for mercy that would not be granted.  It went on for hours, deep into the night.  Crester buried his head under his pillow and tried to  block it out, but there was no escape.  For the first time in his life, Crester wept.
</P>

<P>
Morning found him tired and numb.  The cries had finally died away sometime in the early morning, fading away to pitiful whimpers and then to nothingness.  Crester felt nothing except self loathing.  All the glorious hate that was suppose to nourish him had vanished in the desperate plea of a helpless woman.  A man he had been sent to kill had saved his life and healed him with no expectation of reward, and yet he would not lift a finger to help an innocent halfling escape from pointless torture.  His breath came deeper, and his hands clenched into fists.  The hate that had disappeared began to flow back, but now it was hate with a focus, hate with a purpose.  He had not moved to help the woman and now it was too late to save her, but not too late to avenge her.  Crester prepared himself , donning his armor and draping his alcolyte robe over to conceal the leather.  He would have liked to take his shield and spear, but there was no way he could hide them so he opted for his shortsword and dagger which he could secrete within the folds of his robes.  When he was dressed he sat down and on his cot and opened his grimoire, comitting to memory the runes that would call forth the eldritch powers he would need.  With the spells fresh in his mind Crester made his way down to the chamber where the woman had died.  Outside the door he stopped, not knowing what he wouild see witin, and not wanting to find out.  Taking a deep breath he steeled himself and strode in.  Another novice was there, one of the ones that had brought the woman in with Juneal.  He was standing beside a large table that held the macabre remains.  The flesh, and most of the meat had been stripped from the bones.  The shadowknights and necromancers of the Lodge used bones in many of their rituals and magicks.  The novice was finishing cleaning the bones of flesh.  Anger welled inside Crester, but he was not here to kill this alcolyte, he would if he had the chance, but Juneal was his prime target.
</P>

<P>
“What do you think you are doing.” Crester demanded in a deep voice.  The novice spun around to see who was there.  Seeing that it was only a disgraced shadowknight made novice he sneered and returned to his task.  Crester walked to him, grabbing him roughly and flinging him towards the door.  “Leave now, I am claiming these bones for myself.”  Crester may have been a novice, but he had been a full shadowknight and the change in title did nothing to diminish his power.  The novice paled, knowing his master Juneal would be furious if he let Crester take the remains, but also knowing that Crester was fully capable of  beating him senseless.  Deciding that the immediate threat was the most severe the novice hurried out of the room.  Crester moved to the table and gazed on the skeletal remains of the halfling.   Tears began to dampen his eyes but he fought them back, this was not the time.  The novice would surely run to Juneal to tell him of Crester’s actions and it would not take long for him to arrive to punish him.  Crester removed his sword from under his robes and held it in front of him, keeping his back to the doorway.  As he had surmised it did not take Juneal long to arrive.
</P>

<P>
“How dare you interfere with my servant’s work you insolent dog.” Juneal bellowed as he entered the room.  “You have no rights novice.”  When Crester did not turn or acknowledge Juneal’s presence in anyway Juneal stomped over to him and grabbed his shoulder to spin him violently around.  Crester did not resist and let himself twist with Juneal’s grip, driving the shortsword into his belly as he turned.  Juneal’s eyes went wide with disbelief as he stumbled back.  He stared dumbly at the wound in his gut, then back to Crester, taking another step back when his eyes met the cold hatred radiating from his opponent’s.  Dispatching a shadowknight was not something to be accomplished easily though.  Juneal recovered from his initial shock and began to chant words of magic, but Crester was faster.  Leaping forward Crester grabbed him buy the throat, cutting off Juneal’s spell and giving him time to call one of his own.  Strength flowed from Juneal into Crester, the magick stealing the struggling shadowknight’s energy and feeding it to his attacker.  Crester lifted Juneal from the ground and bore him back into the chamber, his grip turned to iron with the force he had stolen.  
</P>

<P>
“You do not deserve a quick death.”  Crester flung the choking gasping form at the wall.  Juneal slammed into the unforgiving stone and slumped to the floor,  a shiny trail of dark blood staining the wall where his head had passed.  Feebly he tried to rise but Crester kicked him in the face as he moved, knocking him back into the wall where he remained in a pained stupor.  Hearing a gasp behind him he spun around to find the novice that had fetched Juneal staring at the scene in shock.  With all of his unnatural strength Crester hurled his shortsword, watching in grim satisfaction as it buried itself to the hilt in the alcolyte’s chest.  He died silently, blood bubbling from a mouth gaping with surprise.  Turning back to Juneal Crester began one more spell.  Strange lights flared and danced in the air around him, spinning and twirling like demented fireflys.  With the words of magick he directed the lights into the skeletal remains before him, willing them to move in an obscene parody of life.   Somewhere deep within the hate he felt revulsion at visiting this final indignity on this poor dead being, but mostly he only felt the desire to inflict the terror on Juneal that he had inflicted on others.  The skeleton jerkily pulled itself from the table and stood before Crester waiting to be commanded.  Pulling the dagger from his robes he handed it to the undead halfling, trying not to think that the previous evening it had been a living breathing woman begging him for help.  
</P>

<P>
“Pluck out his eyes, then skin the bastard.”  Hissed Crester.
</P>

<P>
“As you command”, came the unearthly reply, though the skeleton had no tongue or throat that could produce speech.  Crester turned and left the chamber, closing the door behind him.  With a quick and purposeful stride he headed down the hall, knowing he must leave Neriak before his treachery was discovered, The Lodge would not let such an act go unpunished..  There was no place for a Teir’Dal beyond Neriak’s gates, but he would serve hate no more.  A journey into the unknown lay ahead of him.  He had not gone far when the screams began….
