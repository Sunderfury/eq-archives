We Teir'dal do not have it easy should we wish to take up the trade of Fletching 
so that we can construct bows and arrows.  We cannot stroll into Kelethin and 
purchase the components for various bows.  Nor can we easily travel to South 
Karana for them.  However, to become a Master in the art of Fletching one only 
needs to make various arrows, and we do have access to the materials for that.
</P>

<P>
You will first need a fletching kit -- no easy task since our fletching shop, 
The Bleek Fletcher (in Neriak Commons), does not see fit to stock them.  They 
are available in Kelethin, South Karana, and The Feerott.  We are not liked in 
Kelethin (read: KOS), and SK is hard to reach, so travel to Feerott is the only 
option.  If you cannot make the trip yourself, have a more experienced friend or 
acquaintance do it for you.
</P>

<P>
With your fletching kit in hand you are ready to begin making arrows and 
eventually mastering the trade of fletching.  Go to the Bleek Fletcher and get 
ready for some sore hands. :)

Arrows are made from four parts: a shaft, an arrowhead, a nock, and a fletch.  
There are numerous types of each, and you will start with the cheapest of all 
four, each of which is 6cp.  Place one of each into your fletching kit, and hit 
combine.  Hopefully, you'll end up with a stack of 5 arrows and a point gain in 
fletching skill.  Luckily, each group of 4 parts makes 5 arrows.  So, 24cp for 5 
of the cheapest arrows (6cp per part, 4 parts needed = 24cp).  What I usually do 
is purchase 20 each (a full stack) of the parts, then use Ctrl-Click (TIP: 
always use ctrl-click rather than clicking and dragging the slider - TRUST ME) 
to move one of each into the kit, combine, repeat, etc.  
</P>

<P>
Eventually you'll get the message &quot;This item is trivial for one of your 
skill.&quot;, and that means you need to move on to something harder to make.  
This is done by using the next most expensive component, whichever component it 
is that's more expensive.  You keep doing this right up until 200 skill!  You 
just keep moving up to the next most expensive component, dropping the other of 
the three back down to the cheapest ones again.  So, if you were using a cheap 
nock, cheap fletch, cheap head, and expensive shaft, and the next most expensive 
component was a nock, you'd then be using expensive nock, cheap fletch, cheap 
head, and cheap shaft.  See?  You just use the next most expensive component, 
while dropping the other three to the cheapest available.  This will take you to 
200 skill.

<P>
You may be wondering about bows.  Bows are not a good, or even <EM>sane</EM>, 
way to raise skill.  Even the cheapest bow is around 4pp to make, and given 
failures, you can see how expensive that would be.  Plus bow parts don't 
stack...  But, once your skill is up to 200, the whole world of bows is 
available to you.  Some of these are shockingly expensive to make (around 400pp 
just to make it!), but have very nice damage and range on them.  I'm not yet 
ready to attempt making bows, so I don't have a lot of info on them, but I will 
update this guide once I've attained 200 skill.  I'm at 113 as of this writing.
