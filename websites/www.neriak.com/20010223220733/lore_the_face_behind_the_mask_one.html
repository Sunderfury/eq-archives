The Face Behind the Mask: Book One
</P>

<P>
Sit and be welcome, my child.
</P>

<P>
No.  I can call you child no longer, for as of this night you are a 
Journeyman of this most noble and proud Hall of the Ebon Mask.  
</P>

<P>
This is a momentous night indeed, for you have earned a great honor which 
should rightly fill you with much deserved pride.  For this is your coming of 
age, my young colleague, your passage to greater things: an equal voice in 
the matters of the Hall, access to superior training, better profits, ... and 
the privilege to See the Face.
</P>

<P>
What Face, you ask?  
</P>

<P>
I shall tell you.
</P>

<P>
Because you have proven your worth and trust to reach this bond of 
Journeyman, you can this evening begin to learn the secret history of the 
Hall: the Face behind the Ebon Mask, as it were.  This is the final stage of 
your Initiation, and it is my duty and my pleasure as Master of Secrets to 
provide to you this enlightenment.  
</P>

<P>
So grant me the loan of your ears and your heart for a time, my fellow 
rogue, and I shall fill them with a heady saga of blood and shadows...
</P>

<P>
Of the Old Empire
</P>

<P>
It began with an Empire, the Old Empire of the Tier`Dal, to be precise.  
Sigh.  So much of the past has become lost to us, my colleague.  I know not 
how much you know of the Elder Days, so let me tell you of them: Know that 
several millennia ago, when the dragon monarchs slipped silently from the 
forefront of Norrath, the Elder Races come forth to fill the void of rule 
they left behind.  From beneath the disappearing shadow of their mighty 
wings, the Dwarves began to  toil under the mountains, the Giants began to 
roam the world with their ravishing strides, and the Elven people were born.  
Crafted by Father Innoruuk, the Teir`Dal marched proudly from the Underfoot 
to forge a vast Empire of Blood and Hate, reigning almost unchallenged by the 
Races of Light.  Our warriors were mighty on the field of war, our elite 
shadowknights fighting savagely at the forefront of every battle.  The dread 
power of our magicks crushed our enemies like grapes in a winepress, and the 
strength and depth of our learning brought us to the very apex of the world.  
</P>

<P>
So great was the size of the Empire, that the need for such as us was 
inevitable.
</P>

<P>
Of Nogras the Unforgiving and the Rise of House V`ree
</P>

<P>
Under the iron hand of RilufecThex (better known to us as Rilufec the 
Conqueror), Eighteenth Imperator of the Undying Dynasty, the grasp of the Old 
Empire stretched forth to encompass nearly the whole of what is now the 
continent of Faydwer, with several small outposts on the vasty continent of 
Tunaria (which the humans now call Antonica).  The Imperator was wise enough 
to know that the size of the Empire now required a finer hand than even the 
most skilled armies could provide.  Enemies from without had become few and 
far between.  Individuals, rather than hosts of foes, had to be dealt with to 
maintain the peace.  Moreover, the Imperator knew that the greatest danger to 
his power came from within the Empire itself.  Superior abilities give rise 
to superior ambitions.  In an Empire of Teir`Dal, there were ambitions 
aplenty simmering warmly at the Imperator's feet.
</P>

<P>
A new elite was needed.  A small, shadowy force at the Imperator's 
personal command to swiftly and silently eliminate his enemies.  It would 
serve as a chirugeon's scalpel, deftly cutting away the infectious tissue of 
dissent and treachery from the body of the Empire.  A Teir`Dal noble was 
chosen for this task, the imperator's cousin and companion from his boyhood 
days.  He was the great Nogras V`ree, the First of Us All.
</P>

<P>
V`ree was a fell warrior in his own right, a particular favorite of the 
Imperator.  Though smallish, sickly looking and quiet, Nogras V`ree was 
nevertheless greatly feared and hated throughout the Empire.  His remarkable 
ability to cause pain and death were developed through the experience gained 
from almost constant personal combat since childhood.  The private histories 
show that V`ree was born with a speech impediment which was often a source of 
great amusement to his fellows.  V`ree paid back their derision by spilling 
their blood and breaking their bones.  At the tender age of but two and 
twenty winters, Nogras V`ree had fought and won the unheard of total of three 
hundred and thirty-eight personal duels.  Those who were not killed were 
permanently broken in body or spirit, affectionately referred to by V`ree as 
the walking dead.  The Art of Revenge became his one true joy, and V`ree 
lavished great care on the poetic redress of every wrong, even if the time of 
revenge took years.  It was not for nothing that he became known as &quot;Nogras 
the Unforgiving.&quot;
</P>

<P>  
Only one childhood tormentor was spared, and we shall deal with her 
later.  
</P>

<P>
Nogras V`ree had but one supporter, one person who ever refused to stain 
Nogras V`ree with mocking laughter when he struggled painfully with speech.  
This was his imperial cousin Rilufec.  Only Rilufec knew the brilliance of 
the mind of Nogras V`ree, and only Rilufec treated him with respect.  
Therefore, Imperator Rilufec Thex possessed Nogras V`ree's undying loyalty, 
as he was the only person on Norrath who was worthy of such a precious gift.  
Such a bond made V`ree the perfect candidate for the Imperator's endeavor.
</P>

<P>
V`ree was the perfect choice in another way, as well.  The Imperator was 
canny enough to know that every weapon required a flaw, a weakness that could 
be exploited lest it be used against him.  Since the beginning of the line, 
The House of V`ree had been magickless.  No glimmer of mana had ever 
manifested in any of its children, nor in Nogras himself.  His remarkable 
abilities were due solely to his uncanny speed, devious intellect and 
indomitable will to win.  If need be, the combined efforts of several 
sorcerers could protect the Imperator should Nogras V`ree turn (if you will 
pardon the expression) rogue.  Thus heartened, the Imperator met with Nogras 
V`ree on the night of the hidden moon, and in the Temple of Innoruuk they 
sealed their destinies together in the Bond of Flaming Iron.  House V`ree and 
all who came from it thus became the personal executioners of the Imperator, 
and was often called the House of the Imperator's Ire.
</P>

<P>
Of the Fall of Nogras V`ree
</P>

<P>
House V`ree fulfilled the Imperator's desires to perfection.  For 
threescore and ten winters every assignment given to Nogras V`ree was carried 
out with panache and finality.  It came to pass that his silent presence at 
the Imperator's left side became cause for unease among the courtiers 
(especially those who had the misfortune to merit his all-seeing gaze), and 
that his absence from the court became reason for absolute dread, for it 
meant that the Great V`ree was pursuing a Blood Hunt at the Imperator's 
command.  His sons and daughters, while lesser lights than their illustrious 
sire, became fell assassins in their own right and were soon known and feared 
throughout the Empire as well.  House V`ree was at its first apex.
</P>

<P>
Ashebhesba N`omed, the Lord High Necromanceress, was perhaps the second 
most powerful individual in the Empire at this time.  Great was her power and 
great was her dark beauty.  If she possessed a flaw, it was in the form of 
her equally magnificent arrogance.  She felt herself drawn to Nogras V`ree as 
a Tier`Dal is drawn to darkness itself.  But V`ree remembered her all too 
well as one of his tormentors from childhood, the only one who had ever 
escaped from his burning vengeance.  Why Nogras V`ree had never sought 
revenge upon her has been a matter of speculation for several centuries.  The 
most common hypothesis for this anomaly is that V`ree desired her and, as a 
result, did not wish her harm.
</P>

<P>  
This theory, however, does not explain the fact that V`ree ended up 
rejecting her.
</P>

<P>
Publicly.
</P>

<P>
It would be the source of his undoing, as well as that of  his greatest 
triumph.
</P>

<P>
To call Ashebhesba N`omed incensed would be to call Solusek's Eye 
slightly tepid.  Her enormous pride pumped raw venom into her veins, and 
darkened her heart to a color blacker than the deepest black.  Even Father 
Innoruuk would have admired the majesty of the hate she manifested towards 
Nogras V`ree, his House, his position at court, and the bond between him and 
the Imperator.  All would fall, even the mighty Imperator, the Lord High 
Necromanceress had ultimately decided.  All would pay for her wounded pride.  
She would then take command of the Empire and receive the homage she richly 
deserved.
</P>

<P>
Over a period of seven winters she gathered allies among her 
necromancers, slowly subverting power from the Imperator to herself.  The 
Imperator was no fool (would to Innoruuk that another such as he come among 
us again!), having discovered the plot by use of an informer planted in the 
Dark Tower of the necromancers in the capital city of Caerthiel.  He 
immediately summoned V`ree to his side.  The Imperator's elite guard, the 
Shadowknights, would be dispatched to the various problem areas to deal with 
the traitors.  Ashebhesba, however, had to be eliminated first; without her, 
the rest would be child's play.  However, to publicly arrest her would be 
folly; it could possibly result in a revolution and, moreover, even 
shadowknights might not be able to overpower her if the arrest were 
attempted.  No, her elimination was vital and it required an infallible 
touch.  
</P>

<P>
The touch of one who had never failed.
</P>

<P>
Nogras V`ree set forth to the citadel of the Necromancer Lord that very 
evening.  A Cleric in the service of the Imperator had blessed him with the 
most powerful might and shielding spells available.  Thus enhanced, he passed 
wraithlike through the arcane corridors of the Dark Tower.  His instincts all 
but cried out that there were too few guards for a stronghold of this sort, 
especially when this was lair of a traitress.  Pausing by the door to her 
private chamber, Nogras V`ree considered the nature of his target and how he 
had gotten this far without incident.  It had been too easy.  Abandoning his 
idea to gain entrance through a window, V`ree merely opened the door.  
Inside, he beheld the achingly beautiful necromanceress sprawled enticingly 
upon her sleeping silks.  She transfixed him with her glittering eyes and 
smiled lazily.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I expected you earlier than this,&quot; she told him.  
</P>

<P>
He nodded in reply.
</P>

<P>
&quot;The fact that the Imperator knows matters not,&quot; she purred.  &quot;It will 
save neither him ... nor you.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Nogras V`ree shrugged, as if to say, &quot;We shall see.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Ashebhesba N`omed slipped to her feet in an effortlessly fluid movement 
and spread her slim arms towards V`ree.  She bared her perfect white teeth in 
a cruel grin and her laughter rang throughout her chamber.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Poor, doomed, stuttering lifetaker,&quot; she chuckled.  &quot;You wonder where 
my necromancers are?  They are even now at my various strongholds, beginning 
the revolution which will end your cousin's reign.  They are even now at your 
precious House ... killing your family.&quot;
</P>

<P>
V`ree hissed, his weapons suddenly appearing in his hands, as if by magic.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Yes,&quot; she preened.  &quot;Your family.  Your sons, your daughters, your 
cousins, uncles and aunts.  All who share the slightest taste of blood with 
the mighty Nogras V`ree will die and be erased from the world.  Innoruuk is 
with me, Imperial lapdog!  He revels in my hate and will grant me victory!&quot;  
She paused, her bosom heaving and her exquisite eyes shining with savage joy. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Is not my revenge worthy of you, o Nogras the U-U-U-Unforgiving?&quot; she 
sneered.
</P>

<P>
Nogras V`ree's howl of rage was answer enough.
</P>

<P>
Before he could reach her, a towering skeleton rose from a pile of 
blackened bones set before her.  A huge scimitar swung at the neck of Nogras 
V`ree.  He did not stay to meet it.  Ducking and whirling, his blades sang a 
song of ensorcerelled steel against the power of Ashebhesba's undead pet.  It 
fell to pieces, and another rose in its place.  Then another.  And yet 
another.
</P>

<P>
Seven pets did Nogras V`ree dispatch, and a score of spells of a most 
terrible nature hurled by the hate-maddened necromanceress did he endure.  
Battered, weakened and dying, he still found power within him to seize the 
throat of the necromanceress with a grip that would put iron to shame. He 
slowly lifted his dirk to strike her down.
</P>

<P>
At that precise moment, the door to the chamber shattered into pieces, 
and Nogras V`ree spun to watch his youngest son Kard (he who was called the 
Crafty) and the Imperator Rilufec Thex himself burst into the room, their 
well-used weapons at the ready.  Nogras V`ree looked at his son, bloodied but 
whole, and his eyes narrowed in an unspoken question.  Kard, well-versed in 
his father's gesture-speech, understood immediately.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Many have fallen, father,&quot; he told him quietly, &quot;But House V`ree yet 
stands, as does the Empire.  I know you told us to remain within the House 
until you had dispatched the necromanceress, but I feared further treachery 
on her part.  Therefore did I persuade my brothers and sisters to go forth to 
help the Imperial Shadowknights in silencing the necromancer traitors.  I 
myself went to provide protection to the Imperator.  Our presence provided 
victory over the witches, albeit at a high cost.  As soon as the situation 
was secure, we rushed here to provide you with aid.  Please forgive my 
disobedience to your orders, o my noble father.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Nogras V`ree nodded grimly, his eyes gleaming with fierce pride for his 
most excellent and worthy son, and then turned to Ashebhesba N`omed.  The 
necromanceress was frozen with terror, not only due to his unyielding grasp,
but also from the hard gazes of hate which burned from the countenances of 
the Imperator and young Kard V`ree.
</P>

<P>
In a low, well-modulated and flawless voice, a voice no one had heard in 
decades, Nogras V`ree said to her, &quot;And this is the Line you thought to 
exterminate, Ashebhesba N`omed?  Look well upon us and despair.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;What magic is this?&quot;  he murmured pleasantly at the look of shock which 
twisted her delicate features.  &quot;No little japes at my speech?  I remember 
them well enough from my youth.  Take your laughter and your failure to the 
Abyss, necromanceress, for with you I have at last revenged myself upon all 
who have ever done me harm.&quot;
</P>

<P>
With that, Nogras V`ree plunged his dirk deep within the perfect form of 
Ashebhesba N`omed.  They both fell heavily to the ground, Nogras V`ree 
watching her closely until the last glimmer of life faded from her sapphire 
eyes.
</P>

<P>
Then the mighty heart of Nogras V`ree stopped, nevermore to beat anew.
</P>

<P>
It is written the the Imperator knelt before the body of Nogras V`ree and 
gently took from his hand his bloodstained dirk.  He carried it all of his 
life in memory of his most loyal and matchless subject ... and friend.
</P>

<P>
Praise be to the memory of Nogras V`ree, the First of Us All.
</P>

<P>
Praise be to the memory of Nogras the Unforgiving who, even at the cost 
of his own life, never failed.
</P>

<P>
Of the Second Rise of House V`ree and of the Ebon Masks
</P>

<P>
After the death of Nogras V`ree, Imperator Rilufec Thex was forced to 
face a grim reality: House V`ree had been all but eradicated.  Only three 
remained and, while formidable, they were nowhere near as magnificent as 
their illustrious sire.  They would eventually fall in the service of the 
Imperator and, as children are slow to come among the long-lived Teir`Dal, 
this would in effect doom House V`ree to extinction.  The solution came from 
the brain of that youngest son of Nogras V`ree (the one known as Kard the 
Crafty), he who had engineered the destruction of the traitors of Ashebhesba 
N`omed and who had personally saved the life of the Imperator from 
assassination in his very Throne Room.  And it was with this solution that 
our present Great Order was birthed: House V`ree would adopt talented 
individuals from outside the House, and train them to the service of the 
Imperator.  This would serve to insure the continuation of the House.  The 
Imperator eagerly agreed, and Kard V`ree set off to work immediately.
</P>

<P>
Two winters later, Kard V`ree arrived at court flanked by two young 
Teir`Dal wearing the livery of House V`ree.  They were cause for much 
interest from the courtiers, not only because of their lean and dangerous 
elegance, but because they both wore black leather faceguards which concealed 
their features.  The imperator dismissed the court and held a private 
audience with Kard and his associates within his secret chambers.  Kard 
introduced his new recruits to the Imperator, and had them unmask before him. 
He explained to the Imperator that the identities of those who would be 
recruited within House V`ree would remain secret, the better to permit these 
operatives to carry out their duties, which would now include espionage (so 
as to ferret out future treachery against the Crown).  Outside of the House 
itself, only the Imperator would be privy to their identities.  It written 
that the Imperator actually smiled, so impressed was he with the cunning of 
Kard the Crafty.  Indeed, Kard's idea surpassed itself in brilliance, for 
while the faceguards served to conceal both face and voice, they also imbued 
their wearers with an aura of mystery and menace which served to enhance the 
already dread reputation of House V'ree.  As in the days of Nogras V`ree, 
many indeed found themselves unsettled when in the presence of these &quot;Ebon 
Masks&quot;.
</P>

<P>
Praise be to the memory of Kard V`ree, the First Guildmaster.
</P>

<P>
Praise be to the memory of Kard the Crafty, crafter of the Ebon Mask.
</P>

<P>
Rest now, fellow rogue.  The rest of our history will wait for another 
evening.
</P>
