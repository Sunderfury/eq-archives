<P>
The Haggle Baron controls commerce in Cabilis - except for those vendors who act under the eye of the Tower of Death.  There has been some whisperings of complaints about the prices in Cabilis, but most find the prices satisfactory
</P>

<P> 
It has been rumored that inside this building is imprisoned an Elf - and I have seen her with my own eyes (And, Aye, I had not been to the Tink and Babble beforehand!).  She looked upon me with neutrality, but seemed perhaps not to speak nor understand me.  Perhaps in time we shall understand why she is in our city, locked into a room in the Haggle Baron's quarters most of the time.  
</P>

<P>
Tis always wise for those just hatched to ask to do favors for those in our city, and I have heard that the Klok Mugruk who works closely with the Haggle Baron could use a young one to do him a favor.
