<P>
The shadows moved.  The Leatherfoot deputy, a small but strong halfling warrior, approached cautiously, his spear pointed forward.  He poked carefully into the bushes, parting the leaves with his spear.  SNAP!  A huge hand grasped the end of his weapon and broke it in two.  The ogre s other hand slammed the deputy backwards and off his feet.
</P>

<P>
The deputy jumped to his feet, parrying a blow from the ogre s sword with the shaft of his spear.  He tossed the useless weapon away and drew his short sword, ducking under another blow.  
</P>

<P>
Below the hill, were several druids.  Though they were young and inexperienced, they ran forward to help their deputy protect the holy ruins that nestled in the nearby valley.  The evil ones must not be allowed to take control of this sacred ground.  
</P>

<P>
They had nearly reached the struggling combatants, when a shadowy figure rose silently from the grass.  The moonlight gleamed on the blade of the apparition s weapon.  It stepped forward and the moon bathed the figure in dim light.  A Shadowknight!  The druids stepped backward as the Teir Dal swung.  One of them was too slow and the blade lay open his torso from shoulder to thigh.  The halfling was dead before he hit the ground.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile, the ogre was having a difficult time trying to hit the deputy.  The agile halfling managed to dodge or block all of the ogre s vicious blows.  He ducked under a swing and came in close to his foe, trying to slash at the brute s legs.  A well-placed kick sent the deputy sprawling.  The ogre was just about to finish his work, when a powerful force rooted him to the ground.  
</P>

<P>
The Teir Dal sprang forward and swung at the chanting druid.  The druid rolled clear but his concentration had been broken.  He spun to meet the Shadowknight wielding a long staff.  The other druid attacked the rooted ogre, blasting the beast with a burst of flames.
</P>

<P>
The Shadowknights eyes shone with ugly hatred as he faced down the halfling druid in front of him.  He held his sword low, with the point facing toward his foe.  The halfling attacked, gripping his staff with both hands.  He spun around and swung the staff with all of his strength. Clang!  It slammed into the Teir Dal s shield.  The dark elf rolled left and swung back as his opponent recovered from the stinging blow.  The sword missed the druid by inches and the two faced each other once again. 
</P>

<P>
The Teir Dal could sense a rising anger in the halfling.  Good, the despicable creature was only adding to the power that drove him!  Hatred was an ally of the evil.  It would serve him more than it served the druid.
</P>

<P>
The druid quickly chanted a phrase of magic, giving his skin the strength and texture of wood.  The Shadowknight leaped forward bringing his sword down in an overhead swing.  The halfling sidestepped quickly and swung his staff into the Teir Dal s gut.  Although the Shadowknight was wearing bronze armor, the blow stunned him and he fell backward.  The druid followed through with a flame burst that would have scorched his enemy, but the spell had no effect.  The dark elf climbed to his feet.
</P>

<P>
The ogre had his hands full now.  A druid had rooted him to the ground and rushed forward to strike at him with a club.  The deputy rose to his feet and, seeing that the ogre was not an immediate threat, ran to face the Teir Dal.  The ogre struggled to rip the roots binding his feet down but they held fast.  The druid swung, striking the ogres knees.  Unfazed, the creature swung a fist that caught the halfling on the forehead and smashed his skull.  The ogre finished the druid off with a swing of his mighty sword, chopping the legs off the hapless halfling.
</P>

<P>
The Teir Dal now faced both the deputy and the young druid.  The deputy thrust with his short blade and the Shadowknight quickly parried.  The druid moved around for an opening and the deputy swung again.  This time the druid rushed in to catch the dark elf off guard.  But, the Shadowknight was ready.  He stepped back, allowing the deputy s blade to swing dangerously close to his chest, and then ducked and rolled, coming up facing the charging druid, blade forward.  The halfling couldn t react in time.  The Teir Dal thrust the weapon forward and impaled the druid on the end of his weapon.
</P>

<P>
The deputy did not wait for the Shadowknight to remove the weapon.  He jumped forward, swinging his weapon with all his might.  The dark elf spun around and used his victim to parry the blow.  Blood flew as the deputy s blade met the flesh of his fallen comrade.  The Shadowknight slammed his shield and knocked the deputy backward.  Recovering, the halfling swung upward, under his enemy s shield.  The Teir Dal s blade was free now and he jumped back and parried the uppercut.  Hatred permeated the duel; both deputy and Shadowknight burned with wrath.
</P>

<P>
Their blades rang loudly in the night.  Thrusting, parrying, hacking, ducking, slashing, dodging, they fought relentlessly.  After a series of futile clashes, the two backed away, catching their breath.  The Teir Dal smiled, his grin reflecting the evil that blackened his soul.  The deputy glared back, scowling.
</P>

<P>
A massive sword sliced silently through the air and the scowling head of the Leatherfoot Deputy hit the ground and rolled to a stop.  The decapitated body fell slowly to the ground as the ogre stepped over the fallen halfling, grinning.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Me sword, da legchopper is a headwhacker too, harhar!&quot;
</P>

<P>  
&quot;Nimobbok,&quot; answered the Shadowknight, &quot;why did you wait so long?&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Was thinkin bout helping, but yous was havin lotsa fun, Xatan!&quot;  Nimobbok patted his comrade on the back.
</P>

<P>
Xatan regained his feet, smiling.  &quot;Well the work isn t over yet, my dumb friend.  You get the meat; I get the bones.  Start skinning.&quot; 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Aw, mees always doing da skinnin,&quot; the ogre complained.  &quot;Yous gotta get yor hands dirty sum time.&quot;   He licked some of the blood from his sword.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Tell you what, you loot and butcher your kills and I ll do the same with mine.  But first, a drink to our victory!&quot;   Xatan opened two bottles of Short Ale and the friends celebrated.  
</P>
