Roleplaying the Teir'Dal
</P>

<P>
First, play on Vallon or Tallon or Rallos Zek.  IMHO these are the forums in 
which the chance to roleplay Teir'Dal characters to the maximum potential 
EverQuest can provide.  If you want to be part of the darkness that is the 
Teir'Dal.. you really need to be able to act with hostility at times.  
Hostility can be done on the normal servers, yes, but there are problems 
with that.  On the blue servers.. what are your options to act with 
aggression towards those who would be your enemies?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  1. Do shouts/says/emotes showing your displeasure with them.<BR>
  2. Attempt to duel them.<BR>
  3. Train them (illegal).<BR>
  4. KS them (illegal).<BR>
  5. Refuse to help them as they are dying.<BR>
  6. Refuse to group with them.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
So those are your options to roleplay aggressively.  There are some serious 
problems with these options.  One main problem is that for the first two.. 
you really need your opponent to participate if any roleplaying interaction 
is going to take place.  The second two are illegal and very low IMO.  As 
for 5..  I personally think that this is going out of the realm of 
roleplaying and into the realm of are you going to help someone else have a 
bit more fun playing the game?  If you refuse to do this when it would be 
easy for you to do so.. I personally think that you are being too hardcore, 
and that you need to realize that there needs to be some player to player 
courtesy and respect.  However, number 5 is a valid option in the RPing of 
Teir'Dal.  Finally, the problem with number 6 is that the only person you 
are hurting when you refuse to group is yourself.  Not only are these 
methods of attempting to RP difficult, illegal, tactless, or 
self-destructive, they are, in general, looked down upon by the general 
populace of the servers.

In light of this, I argue that to roleplay basically any race, especially 
Teir'Dal, to the full potential EverQuest provides, play on a PvP server.  
The PvP servers allow for one of the best and easiest ways to show an enemy 
they are your enemy without being illegal, tactless, or self-destructive.  
This would be to KILL them.  When you come across someone on a normal 
server..  you can talk with them or run past them.  On a PvP server when you 
come across someone.. you can talk with them, run past them, or attack them. 
</P>

<P>
That simple fact allows for alot more decisions in how to play your 
character, and hence allowing for you to roleplay your character.
</P>

<P>
However, I do understand that there are definate downsides to pvp, and you 
can still roleplay the Teir'Dal on the blue servers, its just alot more 
difficult IMO.  So that's my first roleplaying suggestion.
</P>

<P>
Second, know the mindset of the Teir'Dal.  The Teir'Dal are not evil in 
their own opinions.  Sure, they do do what most Americans would believe to 
be evil acts, torturing their prisoners, slaying those around them without 
provocation, being outright racist, but.. that doesn't mean they consider 
themselves to be evil.
</P>

<P>
The Teir'Dal were formed by Innoruuk, the god of Hate.  I would not say 
that the Teir'Dal feed off Hate in the respect that they hate for the sake 
of hate.  The Teir'Dal and Innoruuk himself believe that they have reason to 
hate just about every other race that does now accept their rule.  This 
reason is that the other Gods and their creations refused to recognize the 
position of honor and power Innoruuk believes he deserves.  So.. the 
Teir'Dal hate for a reason, and their hate is focused primarily on all races 
besides their own.  With the exception of Trolls and Ogres for the most 
part, and potentially some Innoruuk following classes.  The Teir'Dal's goal 
in life is to basically gain what they consider the rightfull rulership of 
Norrath, easier said then done, but that is the goal.  So.. in their own 
opinions.. they are only trying to take back what they deserve, and they 
hate those who are trying to stop that from happening.  Thats not so bad is 
it?
</P>

<P>
My third suggestion is to not take roleplaying to far.  Remember that 
although some do not hold the ideal of roleplaying to the height that most 
of us may.. they are just trying to have fun playing a game like we are.  If 
you think that when you are roleplaying soandso is just not getting the 
right idea, and you are actually ruining this person's fun while playing, 
its time to step back and realize this is just a game.  Try to explain to 
them that you are just RPing.  Sometimes soandso just won't get it, if that 
is the case.. just leave them be, ignore them, no longer interact with them 
unless necessitated.  Sometimes it may be necessitated to stop roleplayin to 
watch out for someone elses fun.  This isnt selling out, this is player to 
player courtesy and respect, being a good sport.  Remember others are 
playing this game for different reasons then we are.

<P>
That is all for now.. Go with Hate for those who would deny our Father 
brethren..
