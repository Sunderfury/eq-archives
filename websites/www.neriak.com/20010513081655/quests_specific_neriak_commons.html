So you wish to gain fame and glory with your people?  The road to fame is not always an easy one.

There is an Erudite that is getting supplies that needs to be cut off from his suppliers.  Find the Goblin messenger that supplies him and slay it.  The Goblin Runner can be found in Lavastorm and takes a path from SolusekA to the Entrance to Lavastorm from Nektulos forest.  He should be easy to beat once you're of the experience to be hunting there (low/mid/high teens).  You get minor coin and raised fame among the Indigo Brotherhood and probably lowered Erudite fame (we don't have specific fame information about this quest)

<BR><BR>

Also, Leatherfoot Raiders have invaded our fair forest and the Indigo Brotherhood wants them dead.  Give him four Leatherfoot skullcaps as proof of your prowess.  Out in Nektulos are camps of Leatherfoot Raiders, you want to slay the ones that are <EM>not</EM> Druids to gain the Skullcaps.  Sometimes they can be found at vendors for a price (around 1.5 platinum) from other adventurers who have sold theirs rather than gain glory for themselves.   You will sometimes get a Halberd from this quest as a reward, and minor coin and raised fame among the Indigo Brotherhood and probably lowered halfling fame (we don't have specific fame information about this quest)

The Deathfist Orc pawns are part of a larger plot and King Nathox wants them dead.  Get 4 orc pawn picks and
return them as proof of allegiance to the King's cause.  Orc Pawns can be found in the Eastern Commonlands (mostly near the Nektulos side of the zone) and frequently drop the picks. Be forewarned, though, that the picks are <EM>very</EM> heavy at 10stone weight each, so you may want to not get more than the four requested at a time.  Reward is minor coin and raised fame among the Indigo Brotherhood.  It is rumored that Freeport militia fame goes down with this task, but we don't have specific fame information on this quest yet.

Seloxia Punox

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Deliver a letter of request to Ogguk to Ambassador K`nynn and bring his response back to Seloxia in Neriak.  This sounds easy, and it is in a way, but I got really frustrated waiting for the Ambassador to spawn in Oggok.  Obviously first you make the run to Oggok. Pay for a SoW first if you can, it helps!

<BR><BR>

Once inside of Oggok (and there's enough sites to choke a Froglok that have maps, so getting there shouldn't be difficult direction-wise, but in the Ro's and possibly the swamps area things may tend to jump you at lower levels.) go until you see a network of pillared caves on the left.  Go inside the right most lower entrance.  You'll wind around a bit, but at the forks you want to go basically straight from the entrance to the cave network.  If all goes well, you'll find yourself going up a large steep incline.  You'll then see about 4 ogres, that say that they are Shaman Guildmasters when asked.  Then to the right of that room, there'll be a room of about 9 ogres selling spells and whatnot. This is the Ogre Shaman guild (The Shamen of War).  In the room with the most ogres, you'll see a corridor to the left, go through that.  You'll end up in a large room, with a stone chair on the right wall, and a corridor that leads to an outside view to the left.  Stop in the middle of the room and turn right (facing the chair).  You'll see three small halls leading eventually to a stone bed of sorts.  I found the ambassador in the leftmost small hall at location 361 by 1133.  He arrived promptly at 10am.  He was not present at 9am or 11am.  Give him the letter, and you'll get a small amount of experience and the report to give back to Seloxia.

<BR><BR>

Go back to Neriak and give the report to her for experience, minor silver and copper, and positive faction with the Indigo Brotherhood, and negative faction with the Steel Warriors and the Emerald Warriors. I also got a piece of cloth armor.
