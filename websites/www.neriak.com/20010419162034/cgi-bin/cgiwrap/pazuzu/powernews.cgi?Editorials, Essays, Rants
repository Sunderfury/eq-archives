		While on Test Center to capture some images of The Hole, I was fortunate enough to run into another roleplayer.<p>It's rare that I've seen people on Test Center roleplaying, usually they're exploring, sometimes testing quests and sometimes playing just like roleplayers and non-roleplayers do.  <p>He made a couple good points about Test Center that I'd like to share with you.  It's never very crowded.  You don't usually have to worry about something being camped, because chances are that the spawn isn't even broken!  And, something that I've found on Test Center too, people are usually really friendly on Test.<p>Yes, there is a chance that another player wipe can happen.  But, although I love gaining levels, I love playing with friends too!  Starting over doesn't bother me - because for me it's the fun of being with friends, roleplaying, adventuring and making new ones that makes EverQuest enjoyable for me.<p>If you have this same sense of adventure, and would like to adventure in a less crowded server, Test Center may be for you! =)<p>With thanks to the Enchanter I met this evening in Paineel,<p>

		For those of you who are evil and either plan to or who do currently hunt on the new continent, these words probably give chills.<p>For those of you who are unfamiliar with them, this is one of the factions that the evil outpost on Kunark is aligned with. Unfortunately this is also a faction that three dungeons on Kunark are aligned with.<p>One would think that this would allow us of evil bent to stroll into the dungeon unharmed (after all, why would allies attack us) but this is far from the truth. It seems that these allies perhaps have forgotten that we're their friends and attack us just like anything else would.  And then if we attack back, our VenrilSathir faction lowers.<p>What this means is that if you continue to hunt there that in time, you'd no longer be able to bank or purchase at our evil outpost, and would be kill on sight there.<p>This affects everything for evil races on the new continent, from not being able to kill freely, to not being able to hunt for your own equipment, to getting just frustrated with Verant in general for this factioning.<p>In Verant's defense, they have stated that we should get help from light races to procure items in these dungeons.  As if we would rely that heavily on slaves!  It has also been stated that this is part of a larger story that has yet to unfold.  But, all we of the Evil races of Norrath (not including those cold-blooded Iksar) know is that this seriously limits our hunting grounds and has lowered our morale.<p>We hope that Verant re-considers this factioning and comes up with a compromise instead. While we dark races love a challenge, this one has turned from fun into frustrating.

			Hail All-<p>	      Just last night I was at a friends house, and the uge to just bash some Froglok Tads entered my body, so I turned on EQ and decided to create a warrior. I started to make a Troll warrior as most other people might, but I realized I have yet to try an Iskar Warrior, so I created one. Needless to say, I am very impressed by the race/class combination. I was started off by being given an awesome pike, which I am still using at lvl 8. Yes I made 8 levels in one night (I'll get to that later). At level one, with skill level 0 for piercing I was jabbing frequently for 16 damage. That is a one hit kill for swamp leeches, mosquitoes and decaying skeletons. I level up to two within 15 minutes, and I am sure "good" playes could do it within 5 mins. (not counting giving your letter and all). Now as for the number of creatures, and the newbie zones, I love them. There are creatures literally everywhere on in the Feild of Bone and the Swamp of Hopelessness. They have guards semi-nearby to help you if you need it, and far off away so they won't kill steal. I really enjoy that the most, (it is great not having to worry about a nearby Dragoon or Iron Guardian). Additionally, they have the regen of a Troll! This was so fantastic for me b/c I could go out, beat for a while, get hurt, sit down for a short time, and then go beat some more! Thet get 4 HP per tick, and I just think it is awesome. Additionally, they have a auto Swim Skill of 100, and Foreage ability for all. I really think we need to look more into this class, and I hope we can see some more Iskar Warriors, and less Shamans and Monks =) j/k. <p>LONG LIVE DARKIES!

		        In EQ almost every class has its share of glory. I mean clerics are praised when they go anywhere, Enchanters are constantly being asked to group with someone, and Necros are able to stand alone if they really want to. There is one class though that recieves almost no respect, and is constantly over looked, what class is that you might ask? The Magician of course. I mean look at it this way, I once asked who all knew a level 50 wizard or Necro, and I recieved an overwhelming 20 /tells. After that I asked who all knew a level 50 Magician, and I recieved 2, where one /tell was "isn't there a lvl cap for those guys =)". Magicians are constantly abused and mistreated in my book, and I think they deserve alot of respect for what they do.<p>	How many other classes at lvl one can let your pet attack and damage something like a Will-o-wisp or a Ghoul? How many classes can summon you bandages to heal you after or during a battle? How many classes can summon you a magical backpack to cut the weight in half? There is only one, the Magician. We have a great lack of these casters in our dark world. I personally know only 30 serious Magicians on the entire Rathe server. We look at the class, think they will be cool to play, but at the first sign of trouble what do we do? We push the delete button, and bye bye goes our Magician. <p>	We need to hold on a second before we become frustrated, and try to solve whatever problem we have with our Mage. Sure he may not have the nukes like the Wizard, sure he may not have the pet like a Necro, sure he can't charm or heal like an Enchanter or Cleric, but what he can do is be totally self reliant. <p>	On any other class I guarantee you will spend well over 3000pp easily on a combination of food, water, weapons, armour, and components for spells by the time you are level 50. With the Magician you can do almost all of this for free. Think of just saving half that much, 1500pp, that is a whole new skill you could learn, that is a VERY nice suit of armour for a new character you might create, thatis a whole lotta money for anyone at any level. Why not save it?<p>	I don't ask for everyone to go out and make a DElf Magician right now, all I ask is you give the class a chance, and if you see a struggling Magician in trouble, help him out, and maybe thank him for adding a little variety to the Dark Races. Just respect the class, and realize, the overlooked can easily be your best friend.

		I'd like to talk about a Class we all love - Clerics.<p>They can increase our hit points, heal us, stun monsters for us, resurrect us when we've died -- and can make food and drink when we're hungry and thirsty.  <p>But, on the downside - they have (self-described) "terrible" quests for armor and have to buy good armor, their spells and any mana and wisdom enhancing jewelry/weapons. Many of the Clerical-capable races that don't start out with as much strength naturally are always battling carrying capacity for armor vs. armor class issues.  This in contrast to the other "non Clerical" classes that just usually have to worry about two out of those three.<p>When talking to a 50th season cleric this weekend, he told us that he payed over 1000 platinum for *reagents* for plane raids.  This is *per week*.<p>When I said "Why don't they just all bring their own peridot, etc if they want that particiular spell put upon them?" all he answered was "I wish everyone felt that way!".<p>Now, for a shaman to put Spirit of the Wolf on you costs them nothing but time and mana. Most respectful people donate from 1-5 platinum per person for this (depending on their level and generousity).  But when a Cleric casts a symbol, they lose real platinum.<p>You may argue that at higher levels platinum means nothing.  But that 1000 platinum must come from somewhere.  And usually 2000pp-3000pp can loosen the 'trade only' restriction for items.<p>I have this simple proposal - if you are a melee class, or a class that wants a symbol put upon you, carry a few of the stones of the current Symbol of the clerics you'll probably be grouping with.  You don't need many unless you will be far from town for an extended period.  Just 5 of the current Symbol stone or, if you would prefer a lesser buff maybe 3 of the lower Symbol stone.<p>This will take strain from their bankaccounts, and you will have made a cleric (read: Master of life, death, and resurrections!) probably much happier. =)<p>The list of reagent-symbol-season is as follows:<p><br>Cats Eye Agate - Symbol of Transal - season 14<br>Bloodstone - Symbol of Ryltan - season 24<br>Jasper - Symbol of Pinzarn - season 34<br>Peridot - Symbol of Naltron - season 44<p><br>I'd also like to add that if you consistently would like things like Levitate or Underwater breathing (or some variant that is spell component related) you may want to keep some Bat Wings and Fish Scales handy.  This will take the strain off of our other casting classes and keep them from needing to auction for them, or kill endless streams of easy creatures to get them themselves.<p>Be good to your healers and casters, and they'll be good to you!<p><br>Zariu Qu`el`velguk<br>-23rd season Assassin
