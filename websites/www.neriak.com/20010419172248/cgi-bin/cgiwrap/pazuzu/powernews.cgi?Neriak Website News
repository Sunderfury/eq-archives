		We're still here.  Sort of.<p>The site is being used fairly heavily as a reference.   Very little of the reference information has changed.

We'll update when we feel something warrants it.  The site isn't for sale, and no, you can't "take it over".<br>

		In Skyshrine the halls echo with sounds of the Dragon Kin going about their daily studies of magic and weapons expertise.   The sound is peppered by cries to the Gods of those foolish enough to invade the Dragon fortress, and the sound of their would-be rescuers.  Shouts of help, some shouts of triumph and the groans of the wounded echo through the fortress.<p>But not all are there to fight.<p>"More wine, my dear?", Sevok asks his companion, carafe poised over her glass.  He waits a few heartbeats for a reply, and asks again. His companion appears to be distracted.  Moving the carafe slightly, he allows a few drops to dribble on the hand that is twirling the wine glass around slowly, methodically, distractedly.<p>He is answered by a dagger thrown at his head.  Luckily  Sevok was used to this reaction and had already ducked out of the weapons path.  If there is anything as fast as a startled killer, it is those who keep company with one.<p>"Sevok, my love,"  Zariu wipes off her hand and lies down the linen napkin, sighing heavily, "I am tired".<p>Sevok pauses before replying.  He knew that tone of voice and that it was not arm fatique or a wound that caused such.  One before he had heard these words and knew what she meant by them.  Escape from their realm, in the sleep life with dreams of a terrifying time when magic is not accepted and where his art would be reviled by most.  Yet, he had more than once found himself looking forward to the dreams, looking forward to the wonders of machines who seemed almost alive, but who could follow commands more precisely than any pet could.  To beings that would allow those who owned in it to step inside of it and would roar off to a predetermined destination...<p>He was interruped by a gentle kick given by soft feathered boots.  <p>"Now who is lost in flights of thought?", she teased.<p>One of his rare grins came to his face, and for a moment he looked how he must have as a child discovering the world.  He downs the rest of his wine quickly.<p>They look at each other, eyes full of light and hope and rise, leaving their empty wine glasses and part full carafe.<p>Sevok hastily pens a note, and Zariu sticks it to their bedroom door with a throwing dagger.<p>"Now, let us sleep..." Sevok murmurs, and takes Zariu's hand.<p>The two of them retire to the bedroom and gently close the door.<p>...<p>A few weeks past, one of their Dragon Kin acquaintences happens upon their residence.  One of the few who actually took notice of the two Tier`dal and concerned about his friends, he peers through the window and reads a note on one of their doors:<p>"Sleeping, wake only if something very interesting happens".<p><p><br>-------------------<p>The above sums up our EverQuest status.  Sevok and Zariu are at slumber, dreaming of their real life counterparts and all of the wonder and magick that they see in their daily lives.<p>After 60 days played and wading through downtime, intense pain in my right hand that has drove me to tears some evenings, and the realization that of those 60 days, probably half were spend waiting to fight, it is time to, perhaps not stop playing altogether, but take a long break.  We don't have any intentions to delete them right now, anything that we have spent that much time on is a part of us and as Chaos Magick theory would surmise, would be as real as anything else that much energy was put into.<p>As Sevok dreamed above, there is so much in this world that is there for the taking, if only we apply a little time and effort.<p>We are grateful to our friends for helping us, with laughter, with teleports and resurrections and with being there to adventure with.  We may still be back if something "very interesting" happens.<p><br>Zariu Qu`el`velguk and Sevok Celith'ar - the Keepers of Neriak.com<p>

		We've finally got the winners for the Sidewinder GameVoice contest decided and verified!<p>They are: Szardos and Krescent!<p><br>I would like to add, however, that we're a little bit disappointed that even offering a $50 Cool Toy(tm) for free didn't induce many people to post. =(  Ah well.  Doesn't anyone talk anymore?  Or is everyone just too busy playing? =)<br><br>It seems we've become a popular reference site, and that's good I suppose.  We still get a ton of hits, same as always really, even though no one has submitted new content in ages.  Not much changes really - being a dark race is still kinda tough.  Class changes effecting evil classes haven't occurred in a while.  So I guess being a popular reference site is a good thing.  But... We would like to see some new content - we can't write it ourselves so our viewers have to help out a bit. =)  We are working on a lot of Necro/SK specific content but for other classes and races, we need help!<br>
