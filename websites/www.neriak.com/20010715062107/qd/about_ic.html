<P>
We seek to advance the Teir'dal race to its rightful place as rulers of all Norrath. In order for this to happen, we as Dark Elves must put aside our petty squabbling and infighting and unite to put down the lesser races -- humans, light elves, and erudites alike. 
</P>

<P>
We must rise above the idle feud between our King and Queen and return to the Old Ways of the Father, Innoruuk. Our Hate must be channeled, directed -- not at our Brothers and Sisters, but at the lesser races. Through unity, we can control and rule all Norrath! 
</P>

<P>
We shall do business with the lesser races -- indeed, it is necessary if we wish to obtain all we need -- but we realize always that we are above them in every way.  We may even allow some non-Teir'dal into our ranks (many of them have useful skills), but only as mercenaries or outright slaves.  We shall never share our power with those of lesser races.
</P>

<P>
We look to the example of Lord Mayong Mistmoore as a pinnacle of Dark Elven ambition and achievement, and seek favor and audience with him in order to learn his ways, means, and secrets. 
</P>

<P>
Our King and Queen have not been seen in ages, and have done <EM>nothing</EM> to further our cause of Norrathian domination.  Mayong Mistmoore has single-handedly established a large stronghold, and held same for many years, <EM>deep in the heart of enemy territory</EM>!   This is not a thing to be overlooked!  He maintains a powerful army of guardians and uses them to guard this stronghold and slay numerous light-dwellers attempting to reclaim this land for themselves.
</P>

<P>
We <EM>must</EM> strive to channel our Hatred away from infighting, and outward to the light-dwellers.  Mayhap after gaining favor with Mayong, we can learn of his ways, his strategies, his secrets.  He has acheived much towards Teir'dal greatness, and we believe through studying his example, we can do the same.
