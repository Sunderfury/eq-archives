<P>
Ahh.. Pull up some alkeehol and listen to da newest tale! It time for da Haelrox storee!
<P>

<P>
Needless to say, dis story is da semi-long one. Many moons ago, Ogdan once came visited me and was telling me ‘bout da future armor and weapons me could get, when he told me about da Short Swords of da Ykesha. He said dey were very powerful and it was da next step up for me to become more powerful warrior.
</P>

<P>
He said dat da Ykeshas came from da Ghoul Lord, an evil nastee deep in da dungeon of Guk. He said me would need much help from udders, and to plan carefully when me tried to hunt dis evil froggie.
</P>

<P>
So dis brings us to several days ago. He had gotten tired of Solusek B, so me decided to make Guk me new home. Me had spent several days learning da zone, and me liked it much better dan Solusek B. One day, me heard da shout for a warrior for da Ghoul Lord room, and me happily accepted.
</P>

<P>
Me joined a group of about a dozen udder people who were in da room, and we were killing froggies from all over da place, when
suddenly da throne was inhabited by da infamous Ghoul Lord himself, and he had dis weird curved short sword in his hand. He died berry easily to our large group, and someone pried da sword from da Ghoul Lord’s slimy paw, claiming it to be da famous Short Sword of da Ykesha! Me cheered as we all rolled our dice, hoping to win da famous weapon. 
</P>

<P>
But me cheering was stopped short by me dice, which turned up snake eyes. Dat’s right, 2. Two. Me rolled a two. Me sniffed as one of da wizzies in da room cheered when his dice turned up 93. Ninety-tree?! Two?! Hrmm.. Me scooped up me dice and pick ‘em back in me bag. If da Ykesha spawned dis easily, surely dere would be more.
</P>

<P>
Da next time da Ghoul Lord spawned, he once again had dat Ykesha in his slimy paw. Me cheered as we once again took him down quite easily. Lootery time! Roll da dice, and get a.. 4?! FOUR?! What wrong wid yoo, stupid dice?! Me got minorly upset, and kicked me dice across da room, only to have one of dem bounce off da wall and
hit me in da eye. Da rest of da group chuckled as me angrily picked up me stupid dice. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Time for a pep talk!&quot;, me thought to meself. Me held da dice in my hand and starting talking to ‘em.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Alright, you guys. Me really want dees swords, so please get some higher numbers, pwease??&quot; Me could have SWORN me heard da dice cackle at me as me put ‘em
back in me pouch.
</P>

<P>
Third Ghoul Lord spawn, third Ykesha opportunity. &quot;WOW! Dis must be an EASY camp!&quot;, me thought. What a lie dis would turn out to be.
</P>

<P>
Da dice were trying hard no to laugh as me rolled for dis third Ykesha. 30. Okies. Still sucked. Me watched as da third Ykesha went into someone else’s hands. 
</P>

<P>
For da last time of da day, da Ghoul Lord spawned, again wid a Ykesha. Me just couldn’t believe how easy dis camp was. Four Ykeshas, out of four Ghoul Lords.
</P>

<P>
Me pulled me dice outta da pouch, and poked dem hard. &quot;Come on, guys! Let’s get us a Ykesha!&quot; Da dice stuck out dere tongues at me. Argh! Stupid dice! Me threw dem as hard as me could at da wall. 92! Harhar! NINETY-TOO! Woohoo! Everybodee else looked at dere dice and did da same ting. Everyone threw dere dice at da wall at
blazing speeds. 93. 96. 90. 99. ARGH! Anudder Ykesha lost!
</P>

<P>
Me dice were rubbing dere bruises as me tossed ‘em back into da pouch. Stupid tings. Me gotta remember to buy anudder est wid less.. additude, next time me head into town.
</P>

<P>
Hours went by, and da Ghoul Lord nebber showed up again dat night. No even one. Da four in da group dat were proud owners of dere new swords were shouting for trades and wielding da new weapons. Me just walked out, Executioner’s Axe in hand, muttering at me dice.
</P>


<P>
Dat night left a bad impression in me mind about how rare dees Ykeshas really were.
Me figured if me could get back into dat room, mebbe wid a whole bunch of Scarlets,
me’d have a beddur chance of getting dose Ykeshas, or at least our guild would get
‘em. 
</P>

<P>
So over da next few days, me worked really hard to get peoples to come and help
break da room spawn and maintains da numbers of people dere, as well as make sure
everybodee was getting’ da good experience and having fun.
</P>

<P>
Da only problem was dat da Ghoul Lord refused to show up. Lotsa times. We talking out of three nights, we saw
mebbe three Ghoul Lords. Dis got berry discouraging.
</P>

<P>
It's Not Christmas Yet, Bico!
Den me was introduced to some of da Scarlet Horizon’s elite, namely Milric, Felanima, Bico and Graver. Dees four were a Ghoul Lord-killing mercenary force. Dey invited me over several nights to join dem in dere camps of da Ghoul Lord, but dey would always head out to camp many hours before me would be tired, and me would have to work up anudder team.
</P>

<P>
A couple nights of dis ended in pure tradegy, sometimes wid a BERRY close evacuation, or anudder night were many Scarlets died multiple times. On dat particular night, after Milric and his group had left, da Ghoul Lord spawned wid a Ykesha in his slimy paw. Me got really overexcited and was working like mad to get a second group in dere so we could kill da Ghoul Lord and get me me first Ykesha!
</P>

<P>
Gonan, Garthyr, Sindria, Orthanos, Keryl, Bellerah, Beorengar, and several udders responded to come assist Polina, Garbal and me, who were already dere. Someone from anudder guild offered to help, and we was almost all ready to take down da Ghoul Lord, one at a time, wid Gonan’s feign-deathing expertise, when chaos broke loose.
Somehow, da entire Ghoul Lord room had been aggrovated at our prescence, and all of dem rushed out to initiate combat wid all of us. Gonan bravely held his group from evacuating, at perhaps a chance of killing da Ghoul Lord and looting his sword, but it didn’t work. Garbal fell in battle, and Sindria evacuated, leaving me and Polina to somehow get out alive. Polina gated, and me began da mad dash for da zone, wid da Ghoul Lord in tow behind me. Me was able to shout out, &quot;GHOUL LORD TRAIN!&quot; once while me was panting for breath, running as quick as me could. Me did make it to da zone, but it was like running from a tornado. Everyting and everyone me ran past was swept up in da train, and many innocent peoples died. We’s still no sure exactly how da Ghoul Lord room was aggrovated, but when da wounded Scarlets were able to get back, da Ghoul Lord was killed by anudder group, and we lost a Ykesha. Needless to say, me was berry upset, and me had to camp right den and dere, leaving many Scarlet corpses unattended.
</P>

<P>
Dis was where me had a reality check. Me had been spending TOO much time hunting like a crazed ogre after da Ykeshas, and forgetting dat da entire idea behind me adventuring was to have fun! So, wid a BIG change in attitude and many apologies for me hasty actions da night before, me set out to once again have fun. 
</P>

<P>
As luck would have it, Milric and his group were again in da Ghoul Lord room, torturing da poor bastard for da Ykesha. As me walked in, Milric had da Ghoul Lord pinned to da ground, having a &quot;conversation&quot;. Me could overhear only a little bit as me strained to listen.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Listen here, you little slimy punk. I’ve tired of your crap. Now where is that Ykesha?&quot; Milric clenched his teeth as he shook da lil’ helpless froggie on da ground. Felanima was all grins, as Bico began to cast da anti-undead spell on da helpless Ghoul Lord. Milric shook him again, and da froggie shook his head, shrugging his
shoulders. Bico unleashed da spell, and da froggie’s body convulsed. Graver stood back, singing a taunting tune, making da Ghoul Lord’s torturing death even worse.
</P>

<P>
&quot;NEXT TIME, you’d better bring that sword out, and I want it POLISHED! You here that? POLISHED!&quot; Milric unsheathed his sword, and sliced da Ghoul Lord across da throat, severing his head from da slimy and now limp bodee.
</P>

<P>
Ugh. Note to self: Nebber mess wid Milric.
</P>

<P>
As Milric stood up, he turned to greet me wid a smile. Me was almost too scared to shake his hand as he invited me to join dem. &quot;Haelrox, I think today is your day. Join us for a while. I think good things will happen.&quot; Milric’s face grew a huge grin, as Felanima laughed.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Uhh.. Okies, guys. But me here to have fun! No more anal ogre!&quot; Me smiled as me took a seat next to Bico. He whispered, &quot;Don’t worry, big buddy. Milric’s been having a series of ‘pep talks’ wid da Ghoul Lord.&quot; Me shuddered as me looked over at Milric. He looked content as he rested next to Felanima. As we hunting froggies in da surrounding area, he was trying me hardest just to have fun.
</P>

<P>
When Milric said it was almost time for da Ghoul Lord’s appearance, me chuckled as me walked up to da Ghoul Lord’s throne and turned me back.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Okies! Me wanna feel da Harm Touch, followed by a painful SLASHING sensation!&quot; Everyone chuckled as me patiently waited. Bico tricked me a few times into thinking da Ghoul Lord had appeared, but soon enough da Ghoul Lord spawned behind me back. Me could hear da Ghoul Lord scream like a cheerleader at da sight of Milric. Me turned around to see da Ghoul Lord frantically searching for a Ykesha on his person, as Milric stormed up to begin combat. Da Ghoul Lord realized he was widout weapon, and scrambled up his throne to try to get away. Milric cackled as he stomped his way up da stairs. Da Ghoul Lord began clawing at da wall behind him, and Milric continued. 
</P>

<P>
Fearing da inevitable torture, da Ghoul Lord reached out to touch Milric, sending a blastful Harm Touch through Milric’s body, but Milric only winced in pleasure. Dis was one sick man who enjoyed da Harm Touch. Me watched as Milric grabbed da Ghoul Lord by his slimy leg and whipped him into da air, sending him flying into da center of da room. Bico launched a rooting spell as da froggie landed, and Felanima casted a nasty stun spell. Da Ghoul Lord landed frozen in fear, as ivy roots from da ground came from between da cracks of da ground, wrapping demselves around da Ghoul Lord’s slimy legs, binding his movements.
</P>

<P>
Only da Ghoul Lord’s eyes showed any expression, which happened to be dat of abject horror as Milric charged, almost foaming at da mouth. &quot;WHERE IS THE YKESHA?!&quot; Da froggie’s body unfroze as Milric took his first gigantic swing, only to reach out to try to stop Milric’s ferocious swing.
</P>

<P>
Let’s explain some laws of physics here. Froggie here, wid his slimy and skinee arms, tinks he can stop a two-hundred pound enraged Paladin’s mighty swing. No.
</P>

<P>
Da Ghoul Lord’s arms snapped as Milric sliced his might through da poor frog. Ghoul Lord, no arm movement. Da rest is simply death. Ogre swinging giant axe, wizardess slinging unreal ice comets, cleric chanting undead magic, and bard singing songs that would have made da froggie’s undead ears hurt, had he had any. No Ykesha, though.
</P>

<P>
Round three, da Ghoul Lord finally got da picture. Ykesha in hand, he almost HANDED it right to Milric upon his spawn. Unfortunately, da poor froggie couldn’t let it go. It was stuck to his hand. So da only solution was to rip it from his dead hand. Dis was a fun battle, since me was finally going to get me first Ykesha, after all da many hours of camping me had spent.
</P>

<P>
Simply put, da Ghoul Lord died.
</P>

<P>
Milric took da Ykesha from da Ghoul Lord’s corpse, and wiped off da slime, making da
Ykesha presentable.
</P>

<P>
&quot;For all your hard work, Haelrox, I give you this Short Sword of the Ykesha.
Congratulations!&quot; Felanima, Bico and Graver cheered as Milric handed me da prized
sword me had been after for some time. Me bearhugged everyone, tanking dem over
and over, and held me first Ykesha into da air, shouting &quot;SCARLET HORIZON!&quot;.
</P>

<P>
So now all me needed was one more Ykesha. Anudder day of Ykesha camping would be all me needed. Late one night, Tanas sent me a tell dat Milric and his group would be leaving da Ghoul Lord camp, and dat I should start preparing a second group to take over da camp. Unfortunately, berry little Scarlets was available, so me starting sending out lotsa tells. Thank goodness for Sindria and Garthyr, who had spent many hours assisting me in me camping, once again arrived, wid Polina, who had also spent many hours assisting me. Gonan soon arrived afterwards, and we recruited Esperifiel, from da guild Path of Fire, and Dalthar, a cleric friend of mine since Oasis, who was in da guild Clan Delaf. Raavin also joined us shortly after.
</P>

<P>
Raavin went invisible to scout out da Ghoul Lord room, and came back, studdering and waving his arms. He was all excited, and breathing deeply.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Raavin, wha in da world?! You okies?!&quot; Me turned to Dalthar, who shrugged his arms.
</P>

<P>
&quot;The Ghoul Lord! The Gh.. Yke.. Ghoul Lord has a..&quot; Raavin fainted. Good gracious, this must have been important.
</P>

<P>
Me leaned over and patted Raavin on da face. He shook his head, and popped to his feet. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;The Ghoul Lord! He.. Yke!!&quot; He was breathing deeply again. Me grabbed him by da arms and shook him. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Raavin, calm down! Breathe!&quot; Raavin nodded and proceeded to breathe deeply. He took one last deep breath, and said, &quot;The Ghoul Lord has a Ykesha!&quot; Me cheered, as did da rest of da group. Gonan smiled and said, &quot;Let’s do this. Everyone, back up. Ghoul Lord. Incoming.&quot; He grinned and ran off. We stood back as da brave Gonan ran
into da room, and ran out a few moments later, wid da Ghoul Lord and two Bok Knights running behind him.
</P>

<P>
Gonan looked back at da group, and cackled. He den clutched his chest and began to shake violently. Da froggies stopped slashing in wonder of what was going on. Gonan, started wheezing, holding onto da wall for support. Da Ghoul Lord held da froggies back as Gonan dropped to his knees, wheezing louder. Da froggies watched in
awe, as Gonan went limp, his bodee flopping down in a pile of mush. Da froggies were amazed. Dey stood dere for quite some time, wondering what was going on. Da udder two froggies, looked to da Ghoul Lord for answers. Da Ghoul Lord shrugged his shoulders, and proceeded to walk back to his throne, along wid one of da Bok
Knights. Da second Bok Knight still stood dere, in amazement at da hummie’s death. Gonan opened his far eye and noticed da udder two were gone. He den began to cackle quietly which got da attention of da Bok Knight even more. Da froggie leaned over to check Gonan’s corpse.
</P>

<P>
Gonan cackled as his bodee flipping into da air, grabbing da Bok Knight by da throat wid his legs. Da Bok Knight was choked, unable to call for help. Gonan took a deep breath, and den did da most amazing thing me had ebber seen. He flipped into da air, Bok Knight still clenched in his legs, reached out for da pillar, and pushed off of da pillar, twirling his bodee in da air. At just da
right time, he released da Bok Knight, sending him FLYING through da air right for our group. Raavin cackled as he crouched down and den sprang upside down, unleashing a furious sweeping kick, to intercept da Bok Knight’s flying bodee. It was amazing. Me jaw dropped, as Sindria gasped in amazement.
</P>

<P>
Gonan backflipped his way back to da group, and da melee began. It was a very quick death, wid Esperifiel raining magic down on da Bok Knight like it was nothing. Dalthar stood back, watching in amazement as da duo of Raavin and Gonan played ping pong wid da Bok Knight’s body. Da two passed da Bok Knight back and forth wid a
series of menacing hand and foot combinations, enough to make even da toughest Ogre Bouncers wince in pain. Da final magic barrage from Esperifiel was enough to kill da poor Bok Knight. It was a massacre.
</P>

<P>
Gonan rested up, and once again ran into da Ghoul Lord room. Me can imagine da look on da Ghoul Lord’s face as da dead hummie flung himself back into da room wid a taunting slam to da Ghoul Lord’s face. Gonan once again ran out wid da two froggies behind him, and da stupid froggies feel for it again. Dis time, Gonan clutched his head in pure pain, and began a fierce scream and that da froggies clutch dere ear-holes. Gonan feel to his knees again, and collapsed lifeless. Da Ghoul Lord was confused. He poked at Gonan’s dead body wid da Ykesha, making sure dat dis time da hummie really was dead. Da two froggies waited several minutes to make absolutely sure.
</P>

<P>
Da first Bok Knight grew tired of waiting and started wandering back. Gonan again opened his far eye and made sure da Ghoul Lord was alone. Da Ghoul Lord was just about to thrust his Ykesha through Gonan to make absoltely sure Gonan was dead, but Gonan’s limp body regained life and rolled to dodge da pierce.
</P>

<P>
Da Ghoul Lord was angry, to say da least. He’d fell for da same trick twice now. He commanded his pet to start rapping on Gonan, as Gonan flipped over da Ghoul Lord,
missing anudder swing from da Ykesha. Gonan ran back to da group, bringing da Ghoul Lord and da precious Ykesha back into da corridor where we were waiting to fight.
</P>

<P>
Once again, combat started off wid a bang, as Dalthar and Esperifiel unleashed dere mighty magic on da undead froggie. Sindria and Polina stood back, healing and watching as Raavin, Gonan, Garthyr and me all went to work on da Ghoul Lord wid our fists and swords. Garthyr was pounding on da poor froggie’s head wid his giant head-on-a-stick, as Raavin and Gonan delivered bone-crunching blows to da froggie’s ribcage. Me just kept swinging me axe, slashing deep cuts into da froggie’s arms and body. Da Ghoul Lord’s corpse no could stand dis for berry long and soon his body went lifeless. Gonan pried da Ykesha from the froggie’s paw and chuckled.
</P>

<P>
Since not all of us were Scarlets, we needed to lotto da Ykesha. Me muttered as me pulled out me misbehaved dice. Esperifiel rolled first, and he got a 88. Me was really worried because 88 would be hard to beat. Sindria, Dalthar, Raavin, Gonan, Polina, and Garthyr all rolled. 66, 26, 7, 86.. Uh oh. Me rolled me dice. 66. Really uh oh. Gonan shook his dice in his hand and rolled ‘em. 91! WOOHOO! NINETY-ONE! GONAN won da Ykesha! Me cheered as Gonan smiled at me.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Haelrox, you may have the Ykesha. But if I ever need any help..&quot;, he said. Me cackled, nodding me head. &quot;Yoo knows you can always count on me, all of you!&quot; Me cheered as Gonan handed me the matching sword.
</P>

<P>
We all cheered, heading into da Ghoul Lord’s room to finish off da last Bok Knight. Da battle was quick and easy. As we triumphantly conquered the Ghoul Lord’s room for the night, me climbed onto da throne, cheering, &quot;SCARLET HORIZON FOREVER!&quot; as me waved me new pair of Ykeshas in da air. Wha a great night.
</P>

<P>
<EM>
