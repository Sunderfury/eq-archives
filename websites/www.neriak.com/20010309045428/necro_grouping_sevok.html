<H4>Introduction and Justification</H4>

<P>
Some of you out there may be wondering why I'm writing this guide.  Necromancers 
don't group, you say.  Well, it <STRONG>can</STRONG> be true -- Necromancers are 
one of the soloable classes; they don't have to group.  Numerous Necromancers 
have soloed all the way to Level 50.  Buuuut -- here's the problem:  Planes and 
Dragons.
</P>

<P>
If you don't group, people aren't going to know how you handle yourself in a 
battle.  If they don't know how you are in a fight, you aren't going to get 
invited into a Plane or Dragon group.  And if you don't ever want to go on 
Plane and Dragon raids, then that's fine.  But I'm thinking most of you do, and 
if so, you've got to group and get yourself known as a good player who can 
handle yourself in a fight and work as a part of a team.
</P>

<P>
Still others will say that Necromancers have no use in a group; that they are 
<STRONG>solo only</STRONG>.  I will dispell this myth, hopefully.  Necromancers 
can be quite useful in a group, as those who have grouped with me and other 
Necromancers who play as I do can tell you.
</P>

<H4>The Guide</H4>

<P>
The first thing that will help you be an asset to a group is learn all you can 
about other classes.  Chances are that you already know your class very well, so 
it's time to learn what other classes do.  Go to Everquest websites and read 
guides; learn all you can about each class.  Then, when a group forms, you can 
coordinate duties.
</P>

<P>
For example, let's say you're grouped with a Warrior, a Rogue, a Druid, and a 
Cleric in a dungeon.  Of course, you want to avoid letting runners escape.  You 
can do this by using your Darkness line of spells, which also has the benefit of 
doing damage to the MOB.  The Cleric and the Druid can also do this by using 
Root or Snare respectively.  However, Root and Snare will cancel your Darkness 
spell.  So, you need to coordinate runner-stopping duties.  It's probably best 
for you to handle it with Darkness since it also does damage.  You need to 
discuss this <STRONG>before</STRONG> the battles so that there is no confusion 
and wasted mana.
</P>

<P>
If you're grouped with another Necromancer, you two really need to coordinate 
spell duties because you could really end up wasting huge amounts of mana 
otherwise.  He casts Heat Blood, you cast Heat Blood.  Wasted mana.  Decide 
beforehand who is going to handle which spell lines so you don't waste mana.  Of 
course both of you can Lifetap and/or Shock of Poison without wasting mana -- 
but DOT duties need to be worked out.
</P>

<P>
So you see, the first rule of grouping, and this is true for any class, is to 
learn about the other classes so you can best work with them as a team.
</P>

<P>
Once you've learned about classes (and this is done out of game, before you 
really start serious grouping), then when you form a group, you decide what 
roles you may need to fill in, and set up your spell slots accordingly.  
Depending on group makeup, you will probably need a slightly different spell 
spread, and knowing the other classes helps you decide what spells to mem in.
</P>

<P>
For example, a good small group, believe it or not, consists of a Warrior, a 
Rogue, and a Necromancer.  I've had this group several times and we were 
surprisingly effective -- and this was in Solusek A!  All three of you will need 
to be very good players, but this group actually works quite well.  You will 
want to slot in ALL of your DOTs, your lifetap, Screaming Terror if you have it, 
Cancel Magic, and Dark Empathy.  You duties in a group like this are many.  
</P>

<P>
The Warrior will pull targets to the group.  If he brings more than one, you use 
Screaming Terror (ST) on the ones he <STRONG>is not</STRONG> hitting currently 
-- he controls which MOB has to die first.  Use /assist and make sure you ST the 
extra ones.  ST works <STRONG>exactly</STRONG> like the Enchanter spell 
Mesmerize.  It will take the extra MOBs out of the fight, so the tank will be 
taking damage from only one of them.  Then, if the first MOB is damage shielded 
(i.e., you see &quot;Tank is burned!&quot; when the tank hits the MOB), you use 
Cancel Magic until the shield is off.  THIS WILL SAVE THE TANK!  This is a very 
important strategy.  By this point the ST might have worn off, if so, re-apply.  
Then put Darkness on the current MOB, followed 5 seconds later by Heart Flutter.  
Then, unless it's a really tough fight, do your best to keep the extra MOBs STed 
until the first one dies.  Then it's just a repeat of the above loop until all 
MOBs are dead.
</P>

<P>
Now that above is a description of an easy fight, with nothing going wrong.  It 
may be that the tank gets heavily damaged during pulling, and during the fight, 
gets very near death.  At this point, you have to act like a wizard.  Yell in 
groupspeak for the tank to back off.  Then hopefully the MOB will get onto the 
secondary melee fighter.   Then you smack that MOB with the highest damaging 
spell (NON-DOT) that you have.  Your highest lifetap if under 24, Shock of 
Poison if 24 or up.  Do that until that MOB is DEAD.  You might get aggroed, but 
you will win the fight.  If the tank dies, you're all in trouble -- so save that 
tank with some mega-nuking.
</P>

<P>
After the fight, you all Bind Wound until the tank is at half health, then you 
use Dark Empathy up to his comfort point.  Most good tanks are comfortable 
pulling at 3 bubbles of health (2 bubbles down).  This will allow for 
near-constant killing, a great situation for mass experience gain.  You will 
need to use Dark Pact (&lt; 20) or Allure of Death (&gt; 20) to keep mana up, 
and then of course Lifetap now and then to get life back -- but this is the 
beauty of being a Necromancer -- you can do this, where other casters cannot.
</P>

<P>
If you have a Healer, then you don't need to worry about any healing of the tank 
unless the healer is out of mana.  Then you just DOT/debuff the MOBs and mes 
(ST) as needed.  There may be a time when you need to throw in a Dark Empathy to 
top out the tank's health; hopefully the healer will tell you when.  Also most 
healers can share Cancel Magic duties to keep those damage shields off the MOBs.
</P>

<P>
Notice nowhere above did I mention using a pet.  If you're in a group, you 
really don't need a pet -- and if in a dungeon, you don't even want one.  Why?  
Pets are hell in dungeons.  If a runner gets away, the pet will follow it, then 
2-3 minutes later you'll have a huge train bearing down on your group, all bent 
on slaughtering you and you will all need to zone.  Pets are fine in outdoor 
zones for the most part -- but in a good group you don't need one.
</P>

<P>
Your biggest challenge when you start grouping will be to know how to space out 
DOTs or DD spells to avoid getting aggroed on.  You want the MOB to stay on the 
tank, not you.  When you solo, you don't care if the MOB aggros you; chances are 
you're going to Fear it anyway, or you run around letting your pet hit it while 
it tries to get you.  In group, and especially in a dungeon you CAN NOT use Fear 
and you don't want to run around like you're on crack either, so you have to 
learn to space things out so MOBs stay on the tank.  Generally 5 seconds between 
spells is OK, assuming it's not something high-damage like Shock of Poison.  
You'll need to experiment to get it exactly right.
</P>

<P>
This is basically how to group as a Necromancer.  You don't need to worry about 
buffing, since all our buffs are self-only.  You just need to learn how other 
classes work, and then tailor yourself to what the group needs.  You're very 
versatile -- make use of that versatility and prove to the world that we are 
very useful to groups. :)
