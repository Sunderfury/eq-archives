<P>
I've been asked to tell my story, a honor for a so-termed Slave of the Qu'ellar Dobluthen.
</P>

<P>
<EM>
*Ztiza chuckles, one of her rare displays of her attempt at humor,at this 'title' and sits down to work on some pottery, her delicate claws and toes shaping the clay skillfully*
</EM>
</P>

<P>
Unlike you warm-blooded races, there is no chaos or variance in our hatchings or training.  It was divined on the day that my egg was laid that I would be a shaman, and my egg was taken to the area under the Tabernacle of Terror and there was warmed until I conquered my shell prison and slithered into this world.
</P>

<P>
<EM>
*Ztiza's feet work the pottery wheel mechanism, sending it spinning as she creates a grooved bowl from rare blue clay*
</EM>
</P>

<P>
As a child I was mocked for having too short a tongue to properly enunciate our language properly, but as I was being trained to be a Shaman, I was not exposed for such a flaw.  I worked as a child as a scryer's assistant, as I could pick up language quickly and translate our enemies plans as soon as they were born.  I quickly learned of other cultures, and learned of Innoruuk through my gazing into the pool.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Parents&quot; you ask?  We do not ever know those who hatch us, we are hatched and then taken to our prospective Guilds and incubated there.  As &quot;adults&quot;, we mate when we are instructed to and with whom, lay our eggs and go on with the rest of our tasks.
</P>

<P>
<EM>
*Ztiza sniffs the air deeply*
</EM>
</P>

<P>
I can smell that you seem to have this air about you, that you know where my tale is going.  No, Innoruuk did not touch my life in any significant way, except perhaps what may have passed through Dapri R'nthu.  He was a cleric of Innoruuk whom I often saw through the waters when I was left on my own to see the world in my unique way.  Dapri lived in a city that I came to know as Neriak and I watched him perform tasks - all from healing the sick and infirm, to teaching children of Innoruuk and his might.
</P>

<P>
<EM>
*the whirring of the pottery wheel continues*
</EM>
</P>

<P>
I realized after moons of watching his teachings that I was also being taught, and I learned to revere and respect Innoruuk, though it was said he was not my creator.  My powers stayed the same through this, and it occured to me that perhaps this was power I was born with, not power that was granted to me.
</P>

<P>
As I fought to gain power, I grew more and more isolated from my broodmates.   So when the occasion came when I was allowed to leave our lands and go forth to report on the activities of those who took over our territory of &quot;Overthere&quot;, I had no feeling of regret or sorrow.  I looked forward to meeting those brave souls who had settled so close to our territory.
</P>

<P>
<EM>
*the whirring stops. Ztiza removes her pot from the wheel.*
</EM>
</P>

<P>
Now, I must leave to use the kiln.   Rest of the story you ask?  *Ztiza comes as close to shrugging as she can*.    I shall relate it to you in time, and we have plenty of it...
