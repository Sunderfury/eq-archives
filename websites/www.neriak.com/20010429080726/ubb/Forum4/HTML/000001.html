Something I've done is make <BR>hotkeys for emotes and commentary my char spouts, like "Loristatt checks<BR>the pulse of Deputy Looh, and looks satisfied" and "Now get your halflings<BR>out of Nek Forest, or the murders will continue.." <P>You'd be surprised how many will comment on simple things you do to <BR>embellish your roleplaying.<P>Back to good guys gone bad, oh, believe me, I spare no moment telling <BR>everyone that said good guy is a traitor.

(A GM candidly told me that if a goodie is stupid enough to be ported by a Dark Elf wizzie, then they deserve the consequences). My "Evil Eye" hotkey, give brothers the sign of protection from good.<P>Always, always carry at least 3 potions of Light Healing, and an Egg-Shaped Pumice (Nullify Magic 5 charges). You'll need these for duels. Open the duel by debuffing your opponent, watch their eyes open wide whilst they try to discover who cast it on them. Offer to graciously let them buff up first, maybe they'll be low on mana to start with..<P>(In Character)<BR>  <BR>    My fellow Teir'Dal Brothers and Sisters, I have observed certain phenomena upon Norrath. Here are some theories I have:<P>    Shadowded Men - Where did they come from? Why are they here? Why does their slaughter improve faith with Solusek Ro? I have a theory that Shadowded Men (Smen hereout) are products of the god The Nameless. Why do I think this? Have you not noticed that Smen are all faceless, nameless creatures? Are they not comprised of many of the arts/skills abound on Norrath? They do not appear to be undead. They are found on almost every land on Norrath, why? Could it be that The Nameless seeks to plant "his" vision of a race upon Norrath? Are Smen the former victims of Solusek Ro's wrath, revived from the dead by the Nameless?<P>    Miragul - Read your history of Norrath, this Erudite will one day return. Responsible for the theft of Necromantic texts from Neriak, and spreading our knowledge of the Dead to Erudin, causing the civil war there to begin a fateful end at Paineel. My prediction: Miragul is wandering Norrath as a Lich, capable of weilding "all" magics. I have found no obvious signs of his return, but I await him. I consider him a very large enemy of Neriak, for his theft of knowledge from us..<P>    "Thex" - This name seems to permiate Norrath. Notably, the Thex Dagger, Thex Mallet, our King (named Aythox Thex). Thex Thex Thex, I see this name everywhere. There are kings in many lands with this name, our Queen bears "thex" as part of her name. There is a royal story here, and I aim to find it's source. Could "Thex" be a surname, translated from Old Erudin, or Dragon perhaps meaning "King" or "Royal"? Let me know what you find...<P>    Our King and Queen are diametrically opposed. Why is Neriak split asunder, The Dead oppose The Spurned, and so on... Granted, the royal family was created by our Prince of Hate, hostages from High Elves (hurts to say that). Could our Hate be so ingrained that we would despise each other? I don't think so, mayhap the will of our King and Queen be yet unknown. We have seen the Prince about, I'm told our Queen roamed the lands awhile ago.. Seek I, to meet our Majesty, and know better how this is sorted out..<P>    Question - I'm told there's a door, within Neriak somewhere, that cannot be opened, unlocked, or picked. If you know the exact location of this door, please let me know..<P>That is all I have for now, I feel obligated to return to Halfling Deputy lessons..<P>FINIS PER SOMNIVM REPERIO TIBI<BR>SACRA COR VENEFICVS OSTIVM AVRVM<P>"Comes the end by sleep, I will repare<BR>for you the Sacred Heart which is magic that opens upon the altar."<P>-Loristatt Cave'Lupum<BR>Teir'Dal Spurned<BR>    <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.13.247.203</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

By pulling this trick, and pulling it too often, you are running the risk of having very few people to group with at the higher levels - and by having the word go around that *you* (not your character, You) are a jerk. (this is not my opinion of you, I don't know you, just my perception of how the teleportee may find you)<P>There is a large difference between a character and the person behind the keyboard.

Now, playing, Teir'dal, "afk for a sec baby crying" is VERY common -- denoting to me at least, that people who play Teir'dal (or at least those who stick with it) seem to be older, more mature.<P>That's not to say that younger people can't or don't roleplay, but the desire for instant gratification and easy play is certainly there among the younger ones.  Sticking with the restrictions and such of a Teir'dal is difficult and generally takes someone more mature...<P>And since those who stick with the Teir'dal characters tend to be more mature, the desire for roleplay seems to also be there, and hence you will see a lot more roleplaying Dark Elves...<P>I do, however, run into a decent number of light race roleplayers - usually to a limited degree -- but roleplaying with them plants the seed, and hopefully they enjoy it and continue to do it.<P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Sevok Celith'ar<BR>Teir'dal Necromancer<BR>Darkmoon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 63.78.66.223</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

</FONT><HR>sadly I must admit that in the realm of bristlebane you are more likely to find a Tier'dal named DarkSith (actual name I saw) than you are to find one roleplaying. Not to say my fellow Tier'dal never roleplay, merelyt that they seem more likely to be the type who roleplays on convenience, sadly on this realm the best roleplayers I have seen are the repugnant trolls. particularly a group calle dthe Grobb Skwad. As Light guilds go I must say few of them are really roleplaying, also with the exception of the Company of Silver Star who is most often in character and has gone so far as to create a "rival" guild made up of secondary char's so as they can have guild wars and ongoing RP's.<BR>merely my tuppence.<BR><P>------------------<BR>"and Ye shall reap what ye have sown, and I have sown the seeds of chaos"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 205.180.71.66</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

The players. Not Verant. I so choose to port annoying goodies that badger my char, yet this takes a great deal of effort on the goodguys part to make my char that angry, and NO, I don't do this to everyone. Merely, I illustrated one of the very few "evil" mechanisms that may be employed as a Teir'Dal. I wholehartedly agree that if a goodie asked me for a port, in a "non-roleplaying" context, my char would not port them into enemy territory. More often than not, I receive compliments for roleplaying in this manner and others. (Yes, you had better roleplay being a jerk if you wanna be one, or risk having it misconstrued as OOC conduct.)<P><BR>-Lori</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.13.247.203</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">

</FONT><HR>Role playing is fun!!  yeah right...I am sick of those people who take role playing so seriously...this paly wouldn't heal me cause I was a necro...I was in befallen and there was a huge train caused by a newbie and the newbie died...course I was attacked next cause he trained some heavey stuff...I asked the guy who was a level 50 paly to give me a heal or something and all he said was "Is someone talking to me?"  He watched me die and when I came back he was sitting there laughing at my corpse...from that day on I do not like people who take role play that seriously.  Oh yeah and if you role play as a dark elf necro you are an jerk...hehe I tried to role play once...it ended up I was reported (but nothing happened cause all guides are useless and lazy)  And to lori the *door* in 3rd gate is not a door...it's a little fire place...you click on it and it says you dont have a key and you can't open it...And dont try to convince a guide or the *GM* to open it...it's none of their business...just like asking them if they could pull Naggy for you...that's just unheard of...they are there to do nothing...answer nothing...and help nothing...dont expect them to open that door...I have heard the king and the queen live behind that door...not sure though...no one can open it  <IMG SRC="http://www.neriak.com/ubb/biggrin.gif">  but I started a rogue..and he is going to train all his point into pick lock...I'll get him up to 50 one day and he'll have 255 in lock pick...muhahahaha I'll be the first one to open that door  <IMG SRC="http://www.neriak.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P>Gillberg<BR>The Dead<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>Hello from Tarew Marr!  It has been my experience that most rp'ers are from the evil races.  Most people that rp love the challenge of playing an evil or shunned race/class.  It adds some excitement to the game, in my humble opinion. I have played many different race/classes, and seen and slain almost all that EQ has to offer.  After doing it all I settled on a DE cleric.  I am having the most fun with this character out of them all.  While it is true I am having more trouble raising and questing with this character, but I think the rp aspects more than make up for these short comings.  The character interaction that comes with being an rp'er is to me, more fun than mindlessly slaying everything that walks.  <P>Ok, with that in mind, what exactly does rp'ing mean?  EQ has laid out a story in the manuel of how the world was created and how the different races came to be.  While the story is short and full of gaps, it does mention the basics of race interaction.  DE's are racists and seperratists, believing all others races or inferior, and other gods false.  Does not mean you have to play your character that way?  HELL NO! It is just a guideline of how the creators of the game invisioned their world.  Many tend to follow these guidelines and have great fun with it.  To each his own.  I think one of the underutilized abilities in the game is to type in a description others can read if they inspect you.  If you are rp'ing, type in something that lets others know HOW you are rp'ing. This will cut down on others missed expections of you.  I have no problem letting others inspect me to see my description.  It cuts down on people badgering me for help or guidenece.  If a "good" character, who I don't know, asks me for help, I tell them to inspect me.  They read the following: "I am Lilythe K'nightengale of the Clan Rath N'Karrion.  I am a priestess of Innoruuk, and sworn protector of the Teir'Dal.  If I can be of any assistance to fellow Teir'Dal, just ask! All others I will not tolerate and I give you to the count of 3 to leave! 1....2...."<BR>Most people say thanks and walk away.  I usually send them a /tell saying "its nothing personal, I am just trying to RP!".  Again most people send another tell say "np, good job at rp'ing" and go about their merry way.  Sure, some people are jerks about it, but most don't mind.<P>On to the subject of inflicting harm or teleporting to dangerous areas as a means of rp'ing.  Again, to each his own!  Just don't bitch and moan when you are faced with the repercusions of your actions.  To me, that sounds like a reportable offense.  Others may not see it as rp'ing, just your mean nature showing through.  Please people, this is just a game! A highly addictive and extremly fun one, but just a game.  It is an excape from reality for an hour or two ( unless your me, then its more like 4-5 hrs. a night).  People have the same right to be idiots and wonder around asking for help, just as you have the right carry out your rp'ing to the extent you see fit.  But just as in RL, there is a system in place to make sure your rights don't interfer with the rights of others.<P>Well, thats just my 2cp worth! Have fun and enjoy! =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.27.201.97</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#202050">

</FONT><HR>Hail All,<P>Well, come to mention it, I was questing in Nek forest today and a dispute at the entrance to Neriak enfolded between myslef and a few Dark Ones who thought me, being a Human Shadow Knight, had no right to journey within there lands.<P>Needless to say, a heated discussion ensued and a Necromancer some levels above me challenged. Well, luckily for me I was able to placate him and his fellows on the virtues of members of the Dismal Rage (it took some time...). In the end, we parted ways, graciously if not freindly.<P>A few minutes later I get a tell from one of them thanking me on my RP skills..... I've never had anyone do that. It put a nice warm in my cool heart to hear such praise.<P>BTW, I totally agree about the "light" races lack of RP. Funny how I RP, but I am evil....<P>Anvill<BR>5th season Kight of Innoruuk<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: 24.200.164.140</font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#303070">
