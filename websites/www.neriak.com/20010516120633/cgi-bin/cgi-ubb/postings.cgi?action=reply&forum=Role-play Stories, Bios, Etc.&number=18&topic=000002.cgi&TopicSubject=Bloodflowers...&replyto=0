<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Bloodflowers:
[B]Come come, you must have come here for a reason.

Not many come here just to look at me. Well, that's a lie, lots of people do, I just ignore them.

Oh, so that's what you want. Easy enough. Or hard. Depends on what I feel when I tell you about it.

I think you know my name, but I'll tell you it anyway. When I was thirteen, my mother died. Now I won't go into the details, I'll just say that it wasn't very pleasant for my father. She was the one who raised me, primarily, taught me almost everything I know. Same with my father, she was the dark rose brought to him, the warmth on the black velvet of his heart. He couldn't deal with the fact that she really was dead now, followed the bones down to rest with them. And as an able caster of the bones himself, he sought ways of bringing her back.

The easiest, of course, was to get parts of her bone and raise her again, but she would be ugly and incomplete, no mind, no warmth. He dedicated the rest of his failing life to it, leaving me to pretty much wander where I will. It was fun for me at thirteen, I spent time with friends in the Foreign Quarter, spent nights at the Blind Fish, just waiting for the day when I'll go home and see my mother there, flesh as alive as it'll ever get.

Well, it never got that way. In fact, the longer my father spent locked away, trying to find a way to bring her back, to wrench her soul from Innoruuk to have as his own, the closer he came to dying himself. That birthed the disease, I think. The one that slowly ate him away, tore his mind apart. He wouldn't let me take him to The Spurned or the Spires. He wouldn't let me help at all. He just stared at me, told me to go away, said that soon I'd see my mother again.

He took things from me, yeah. Bits of blood and hair, sometimes little chunks of my skin when he ran out. He said I was a lot like her, that I looked like her, had the same form, the same face. He said I was more a part of her, in the physical at least, than he was, and that he needed me. Each night he gave me a kiss before I went to sleep. Each morning I woke up with blood on my sheets.

I should have known that time he spent days in there, locked in the study with only his memories and a vial of my blood. I should have known I shouldn't have come up there with food, come up there to see if he needed anything. I should have known enough to run when he looked at me, those green eyes sparking with two kinds of recognition. "It worked," he said, "It finally worked.". I knew what magic felt like, and he had just cast it, before I came in. Eyes played along my form, I remember. He rushed out of his seat and grabbed me, gave me a kiss. Not like those he did before I went to sleep. And he called me by my mother's name.

I should have known enough to run away right then. But I stayed, watched his decline over those three days, as what memory he had of the real me sort of disappeared, and he thought of me more and more as my mother. It was the logical thing to do, really. When I caught him naked in the night, close to my bed. It really was quite smart. I mean, I always kept my sword close, and if it was anyone else, I would've done the same thing. I only really felt it afterwards, after I saw him dead on my floor. It wasn't planned. It just happened.

That's why I stay here now, mostly. I like this place, like sitting in the bar below The Maiden's Fancy, watching the various dancers and whores, watching the guys they went off with, wondering about their own stories. The drinks are nice, and it gives me time to think.
