The Face Behind the Mask: Book II
</P>

Welcome back, my colleague.<BR>
I am gratified that you wish to know more of our proud Hall.  So few do, these nights.<BR>
So grant me again the loan of your ears and your heart for a time, my fellow rogue, and we shall continue our journey along a heady saga of blood and shadows...<BR>

<P>
Of the Corruption of the Empire
</P>

<P>
The reign of Onnilct Thex (whom history calls the Dissolute), 26th Imperator of the Undying Dynasty, was the beginning of the End.  Over the millenia, the Empire had grown fat upon the swell of its own near-limitless prosperity.  Decay had emerged silently within its unassailable borders and was eating inexorably away at the once mighty roots of the Great Houses.  Our nobles had become wastrels of power and only the pursuit of excess fueled the blood in their veins and set their misguided hearts to pound.  Our warriors and shadowknights, bored from a lack of enemies, fell to preying upon each other in pointless duels.  Our dread sorcerers sank into the dark pit of blasphemous rituals and drank deeply of the cup of sweet corruption.
</P>

<P>
We saw this.  We saw all of this.
</P>

<P>
The courts themselves had become elegant battlefields.  Competition for power and position was all, leading to a marked increase in the number of fatal skirmishes.  Life itself had become a macabre dance of eloquent insults and well-poisoned daggers.  Death was commonplace, crime was happenstance, and more and more did the Teir’Dal turn their wine-soaked faces away from Father Innoruuk. 
</P>

<P>
And we saw this.  We saw all of this.
</P>

<P>
The Imperator was a fool, content to live in debauchery and pleasure, blind to the proper care of the Empire.  In the fiftieth winter of his reign, an oddity occurred.  More and more deaths bore an aspect which brought House V’ree to the fullest of alerts: the immistakable mark of professionalism.  Other assassins now prowled in the shadows of the Empire, assassins of which we had been previously unaware.  We so informed the Imperator, who dismissed us with a feeble wave of his pudgy, overindulged hand.  &quot;We are the mightiest nation on Norrath,&quot; he belched at us contentedly.  &quot;For millennia have we stood, and for millennia we shall remain.  Let the nobles play at what they will.  Only the strongest and most cunning will survive and we shall be the better for it.&quot;  Trembling with barely suppressed rage, we ground our teeth and returned to the safety of our House to prepare for War.  
</P>

<P>
For we saw this.  We saw all of this.
</P>

<P>
House V’ree had but a single true ally outside of its membership: the Imperator’s daughter, the scholarly Zhelebati.  Her eyes were clear and wise and remembered well what the Empire and her citizenry had once been.  Indeed, the blood of this noble descendant of Rilufec Thex the Conqueror had remained unspoiled throughout the decay of the times.  It was she who met with Guildmaster Arceas V’ree during those terrible time.  The two realized that the use of assassins outside of the purview of House V’ree was nothing less than a display of open treason against the Bloodstone Throne.  
</P>

<P>
That it was also a formal declaration of war against House V’ree we realized when the body of one of our own was discovered upon our doorstep.
</P>

<P>
Of Dencarja the Huntress and the House V’ree Killings
</P>

<P>
The victim had been new to House V’ree.  We had recruited him from the lesser nobility, a third son with no hope for inheritance, but born with the gift of speed and intelligence, making him valuable to us.  Now he lay dead, his potential sadly unfulfilled.  
</P>

<P>
The finest investigator within House V’ree at that time was Dencarja, known affectionately among her peers as &quot;the Huntress&quot;.  She was tall for a Teir’Dal, as slim as a rapier and three times as sharp.  Her wits were as swift as the strike of a serpent, and her gleaming amber eyes missed little.  She and her two aides were immediately assigned to this matter.  Her careful examination of the dead operative revealed no sign of magickal assault; death appeared to have been instantaneous, the result of a single stab wound from a medium length stiletto up under the breastbone and into the heart.  Considering carefully the angle of the stroke, Dencarja determined that the assassin had been right-handed, of medium height, and not considered to have been a threat by his target.  Nothing else could have explained how the assassin could have gotten close enough to the deceased without a struggle; the body showed no sign of exertion, laceration or even mussing of hair.
</P>

<P>
This was not to say that the assassination was ordinary, by professional standards.  Dencarja noted two mutilations, both (following forensic examination) to have been performed post mortem: the youngling’s right hand had been severed and removed, and his chest had been branded with the symbol of a Hand.  Written in blood (the youngling’s in fact) upon the marble flagstones was the following:
</P>

<P>
THE HAND OF DESTINY DID THIS.  YOUR TIME IN SHADOW IS OVER.
</P>

<P>
This killing was a message, a challenge ...  and Dencarja the Huntress vowed to seek out this Hand of Destiny, and present to it a destiny most unpleasant.
</P>

<P>
The following night, another operative of House V’ree was found dead in the private rooms of one of the local taverns.  A journeyman of no mean ability, he had successfully engineered sixteen removals in his professional career.  His demise meant that the Hand of Destiny was better than the House had originally surmised.  Again, death had been the result of that perfect, single stoke up under the breastbone and neatly cleaving the heart.  Again, the victim had been branded with the sign of the hand, his right hand severed at the wrist and removed.  The duplication was so exact, that Dencarja was certain that this killing had been made by the same assassin.  A dangerous man, to be sure, and clever.
</P>

<P>
A new, jeering legend was written in the blood of the deceased upon the wall next to the body: YOUR ADEPTS ARE NOTHING TO US.  And Dencarja grit her teeth in anger and snarled to herself: We shall see.
</P>

<P>
The third death, two nights later, sent a ripple of unease throughout all of House V’ree.  This one had been the most skilled and experienced of the three.  Dencarja had known Master Efkin A’dalb since her earliest days of training.  The man had been a positive genius with edged weaponry and had sent more targets to the Abyss than many could count.  Now he was no more, assassinated at his own apartments near the theatre district.  That one such as he could be taken down was a source of considerable distress.  
</P>

<P>
There had been a struggle this time.  A slim, yet ragged tear in Master Efkin’s doublet told the tale of how the assassin (for it must surely again have been he) had gotten close enough to attempt the same professional stroke, but had failed.  Most likely, Master Efkin had twisted out its path, the tip of the stiletto catching onto the cloth as he turned.  A bruise upon the victim’s jaw was probably the result of a glancing blow by the assassin, enough to stun Master Efkin for the assassin to glide alongside and behind him, so as to bury the stiletto into Master Efkin’s left kidney.  Shock followed surely, then death.
</P>

<P>
The brand was present upon master Efkin’s chest, and his hand was missing.  His left hand.  That had been interesting indeed, mused Dencarja.  Master Efkin was left-handed, but took great pains to hide this fact by utilizing  his right hand in public.  The assassin was either remarkably receptive or he had been intimately acquainted with Master Efkin.  The coldness that then seized her stomach told Dencarja of a new perception: Perhaps the assassin had been well acquainted with all three of his victims.  It explained much.
</P>

<P>
And the newest bloody taunt did mock her as it dried upon the wall: 
</P>

<P>
NOW WE SHALL TAKE HEADS.
</P>

<P>
Of the Great Failure of House V’ree
</P>

<P>
Was there a connection between the increased assassinations of late among the nobility and the House V’ree killings?  Dencarja had not enough data to determine a connection.  Still, assassins required a patron, and only a powerful patron indeed could field so skilled an operative as the assassin preying upon House V’ree.  Zhelebati was, of course, consulted.  She confirmed our concerns of members of the nobility doing more than merely craving the power of the Bloodstone Throne.  She gladly gave Dencarja all the information at her disposal, and provided her with the names of others loyal to the Empire who might be able to offer aid to the investigations of House V’ree.
</P>

<P>
Later that evening, Zhelebati and her son of twelve winters walked the great corridors of the Imperial Palace, her bodyguards at her side.  They were two of the finest House V’ree could provide, loyal beyond question and swift as thought.  Zhelebati never failed to feel safe in their presence.  As she passed the huge golden door to her left, her nose wrinkled in distaste.  The door led to the Imperator’s pleasure chambers, where all matter of deviancy and debauchery was practiced by Onnilct Thex the Dissolute.  She felt a wave of sympathy for the ebon masked stalwart who stood guard before the door to the Golden Room.  How sad, she had thought, for such a fine professional as he to have the misfortune of guarding so loathsome a place.
</P>

<P>
That thought lasted but a single moment, for Zhelebati’s eyes were quick and clear and marked an anomaly in the guard at the door.  As with all operatives of House V’ree (with the exception of those who carried that most noble blood in their veins) , the identity of the guard was unknown, his only distinguishing feature being his fearsome black leather faceguard.  Since childhood, Zhelebati had noticed that each faceguard was subtly different from every other, a tiny concession of individuality by these nameless marvels.  The guard who stood at the door to the Golden Room wore the same mask as ever ... but he was not the same man, of that she was certain.  With a strength of will that did honor to her ancestors, Zhelebati calmly continued her walk to the Imperial Libraries and shut the door immediately behind her and her party.
</P>

<P>
Her bodyguards knew and respected her enough over the years they had served not to dismiss her observations out of hand.  Indeed, they alerted the shadowknights on duty to accompany them to the Golden Room.  When they arrived, they found the guard gone, his ebon mask lying broken upon the floor.  A full alert was sounded within the palace, and a courier was sent to summon Dencarja the Huntress.  The Imperator was nowhere to be found.  Dread in his heart, one of Zhelebati’s bodyguards ventured to force open the door to the Golden Room and enter.  He returned, trembling for perhaps the first time in his harsh and danger-ridden life, shaking off all questions as to what he had seen.  He and his partner then placed themselves before the door and told the shadowknights to secure the Palace.
</P>

<P>
When Dencarja arrived with her ever-present aides, she was immediately ushered by the commander of the shadowknights to the door to the Golden Room.  She took in the unease of the bodyguard who had passed within the chamber and asked of him what he had seen.  He looked at her with tortured eyes from behind his ebon mask and whispered thusly unto her: 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Our failure.&quot;
</P>

<P>
And Dencarja perceived the validity of his words when she walked into the Golden Room and saw the body of Onnilct Thex, 26th Imperator of the Undying Dynasty, lying in a pool of his own blood.  In such a manner did Onnilct Thex the Dissolute perish: tangled in his own sleeping silks, his weak throat slit from ear to ear, naked and helpless amid the shame of his debauchery.  So was erased form Norrath this disgrace from birth to death to the memory of his ancestors, his noble blood finally freed from their prison within his unworthy flesh.  Mourn him not, for none of us do.  Mourn instead our failure to keep him safe, despite himself.
</P>

<P>
Dencarja examined the body carefully.  There were differences here which did not fit the previous patterns.  The stink of magickal assault was present.  There was a massive burn mark in the shape of a hand upon the Imperator which yet smoldered with eldritch residue.  It was, immistakably, the sign of a Harm Touch.  A shadowknight had done this.  A female, Dencarja deduced, given the size of the handprint and the intimate nature of its location upon which it situated itself.  A fitting area from which one such as the Imperator should find his demise, she thought wryly.
</P>

<P>
The rest of the body yielded little.  No sign of struggle, no other wounds or abrasions.  Again a hand had been amputated, the left one, to be precise.  This troubled Dencarja.  The Imperator had been right-handed.  That the Hand was clever and well-informed was obvious.  Of the three operatives of the House they had murdered (perhaps four now, Dencarja mused, counting the missing guard who had once stood before the door to the Golden Room), two had been right-handed men, the last left-handed.  The proper hands had been removed.  Indeed, even though the left-handed man had taken pains to use his right hand at all times, the assassin of the Hand still knew enough to remove his left hand.  Surely all within the Empire knew the Imperator had been right-handed.  Why then, should the Hand, so exact and professional in their dealings, make so obvious a mistake?  
</P>

<P>
It defied the pattern entirely for so clever an enemy, unless...
</P>

<P>
Dencarja bolted from the room in a panic, leaving her bewildered aides behind.  Bursting onto the streets from the Palace, she sped across three avenues before catching a glimpse of a mage she knew lived but a block away from House V’ree proper.  With a snarl that would have set a pack of shadow wolves to flight, she forced the mage at knifepoint to gate back to his home with her alongside him.  The lurch that struck her stomach as reality shifted was nothing compared to icy fingers of dread which were seeking to strangle her heart.
</P>

<P>
An instant later, they appeared within the shaken mage’s apartments.  Growling her thanks, she tore through the stairs and leaped back onto the streets, legs pumping furiously, her heart a fierce pounding in her ears.
</P>

<P>
I have been a fool, she thought furiously.  I have had the pieces and failed to test their fit.  The memories of her teachers echoed coldly within her mind.  Mark the patterns, they had instructed her, and collect the pieces to the puzzle.  The pictures will deceive you, so concern yourself not with them.  Concentrate instead upon the fit of the pieces.  When they fit, the pattern will be clear.  Seek subtlety where subtlety is expected, foolishness where foolishness abounds.  A clever enemy does not engage in folly.  Instead, they either seek to remain invisible or, in their arrogance, tempt their own discovery by leaving what they consider clever clues as to their nature and actions.
</P>

<P>
The deaths of the operatives had been too perfect.  She knew that now.  The lack of struggle did not so much reflect the assassin’s knowledge of the targets, but of the targets’ familiarity with the assassin.  As unimaginable as it seemed, a traitor must needs live within House V’ree.  A traitor who was taunting her with clues she would have seen had she but realized this.  This final clue had been obscure to all but her.  Ever the historian, Dencarja had studied the life of the First One, the incomparable Nogras V’ree.  When at court, he would always be present at the left side of his liegelord, Imperator Rilufec Thex the Conqueror.  The Imperator had been a magnificent warrior, right-handed, but his finest weapon had ever been House V’ree.  The Imperator’s left hand.
</P>

<P>
Upon reaching House V’ree, Dencarja all but ripped the massive doors from their fastenings and shot through the hallways, bowling over any Teir’Dal in her path as she flew up the stairways to the private chambers of Guildmaster Arceas V’ree.  The bloody legend above the last operative killed before the Imperator had made it clear: NOW WE SHALL TAKE HEADS, it had said.  Not heads from their victims, but heads of state.  The Imperator had been first, and his particular mutilation had made manifest the identity of the next target.  The Imperator’s left hand, House V’ree: the Guildmaster Arceas V’ree.  He who was her father.
</P>

<P>
And the color in the face of Dencarja V’ree drained away when she took in the absence of the guard from his post before her father’s chamber.  Kicking the door open, she beheld the body of Arceas V’ree sprawled over his desk, the hilt of the dagger that took his life protruding like a hideous horn at the base of his neck.  She ran to him, knowing that she was too late, running just the same.  The whisper of a sleeve revealed to her that her father’s assassin was still within the room, and she spun in time to see a cloaked figure hurl an object to her and flee.  Decades of training yet ruled Dencarja’s body, and she shifted enough to escape instant death as the knife struck her temple.  As darkness took her, she vowed the most terrible of vengeances against the man who had done this, for she had seen within his cloak before he fled.  Terrible beyond measure would be fate of the man would had betrayed all for which she cared.  Damned would be this man who had, until this moment, been her husband.
</P>

<P>
Of the Flight of House V’ree and the War of Assassins
</P>

<P>
When Dencarja at last opened her eyes, the first face she beheld was that of Zhelebati, the Imperator’s daughter (now the Imperatrix, she reminded herself) looking down upon her, her face drawn but composed.
</P>

<P>
&quot;How long have I been unconscious?&quot; croaked a voice she realized had been her own.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Nine days,&quot; replied a low voice to her left.
</P>

<P>
Sitting up in her cot and cursing at the wave of agony that suddenly tore at the side of her head, Dencarja turned to the powerful figure of Isumar V’ree, her older brother.  He stood against the wall, arms folded, his heavy brows drawn tightly together in thought.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I thought you were on a mission in the Cauldron,&quot; Dencarja mumbled painfully.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I came back,&quot; he said quietly.  &quot;The safety of House V’ree comes before all things.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;You must know ...&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;I know,&quot; he then replied.  Therefore did Isumar V’ree explain that Dencarja’s abrupt arrival and race through the House had set others in curiosity to follow her, in order to see what had been the matter.  They had reached the Guildmaster’s chambers in time to be knocked aside by the Traitor, who was making his escape.  Of course, Isumar told her, they did not realize that was the case at the time, not until they entered the chamber and saw what had in fact occurred.  By then, naturally, the Traitor was gone.
</P>

<P>
&quot;We are alive thanks solely to Master Gantinogus,&quot; Isumar V’ree so informed Dencarja, &quot;It was he who realized that the whole of House V’ree was now in immediate danger.  He mobilized the Masters and operatives within the House and sent them away into hiding, into the secret boltholes every operative must make and keep hidden from even his brethren.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Dencarja finally noted her surroundings.  She and seven others were in a large chamber of damp, musty walls of stone with crates of  weaponry and food piled high in a corner.  One sturdy, well-guarded door (another surely secreted somewhere in the room).  There were no windows, and the flickering lights of several candles caused the shadows to dance feebly along the walls.  
</P>

<P>
&quot;Where are we?&quot;  Dencarja asked of her brother.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Safe,&quot; Isumar said unto her wryly, &quot;For now.&quot;  He then confided that they were within one of his personal safehouses, roughly an entire city block underneath the Caerthiel Museum.  Twelve operatives were present, including himself and Dencarja.  As for the others, all who had been in House V’ree were scattered throughout the city.  Those operating outside of the capitol were being alerted and recalled in secret by couriers.
</P>

<P>
&quot;And Master Gantinogus?&quot;  Dencarja had asked.
</P>

<P>
Isumar is said to have heaved a ragged sigh of anger that shook his heavily-muscled shoulders.
</P>

<P>
Then did Isumar V’ree tell Dencarja how Master Gantinogus had sealed himself and twelve journeymen within House V’ree proper, having so done in order to provide the others time to escape.  The old teaching-master had vowed to defend House V’ree to the death, and had thus far withstood four days of open siege from rebel troops under the command of one Curmsa T’rubus.
</P>

<P>
At the mention of that name, the scholarly Zhelebati turned, her face a graven mask.  Dencarja noted how much the Imperator’s daughter had changed since last she saw her.  She seemed taller somehow, with a hardness only strife engenders to those it chooses to visit.  Then did Zhelebati explain that her distant cousin, the minor noble called Curmsa T’rubus, was in fact the intelligence behind the Hand of Destiny.  It had no doubt been he who had corrupted the Traitor, and with him launched the spearhead of killing to distract House V’ree in order to assassinate the Imperator.  The chaos that had followed had allowed him to declare himself dictator by an ignorant citizenry, for the purpose of quelling the rebellion that he himself had started.  The streets, she told Dencarja, were awash with soldiers.  Several Great Houses had been arrested and extinguished upon false charges of treason.  She herself and her young son were all that was left of the Imperial bloodline.  All others, including Curmsa’s own family, had been put to the sword.  If it had not been for Dencarja’s aides, who had taken Zhelebati and her son to House V’ree when Dencarja had bolted from the Imperator’s body, the Undying Dynasty of Thex would have fallen that day to the ambitions of Curmsa T’rubus and his dark standards of the Hand.
</P>

<P>
And Dencarja stood, and let the last of her emotions slide away from her soul as they were but a silken shawl shrugged gently off of her delicate indigo shoulders.  She let the Hatred of Innoruuk enter into her, felt it give heat to the blood in her veins, clarity to her heart and power to her voice.  Calm came to her mind, such was the purity of the Hate.  It was the highest blessing a Teir’Dal can ever hope for: a touch of godhood from the Father Himself .  When next she spoke, her quiet toneless words filled the chamber with the chill of the Abyss itself.
</P>

<P>
&quot;We will attack,&quot; she said simply.
</P>

<P>
Isumar V’ree cleared his throat.
</P>

<P>
&quot;I am Guildmaster now, o my sister,&quot;  he reminded her.  &quot;House V’ree is my responsibility.  Not yours.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;No,&quot; Dencarja V’ree replied.
</P>

<P>
&quot;No?&quot; Isumar V’ree then asked of her.
</P>

<P>
Therefore did Dencarja V’ree reply:  &quot;I have been blind, o my brother.  Such blindness has cost our House dearly.  An Imperator has perished due to my incompetence.  The Line of Thex is endangered, mayhap the whole of the Empire.  The dead cry for vengeance and Innoruuk has listened.  I carry his blessing in my soul.  Leave me to my destiny of revenge, Isumar, for I will not permit even you to keep me from it.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Isumar V’ree did then look upon his sister and he saw the changes which had transformed her from within.  Her beauty had become a terrible thing, and he saw in the controlled fury of her blazing eyes the Hate of Innoruuk she now carried inside her soul.  And he smiled upon her in the manner of old when they had been children together and made the sign of salute.
</P>

<P>
&quot;What is your will,&quot; he spoke unto her, &quot;My Guildmistress?&quot;
</P>

<P>
And Dencarja laid her hand upon the strong, broad shoulder of Isumar V’ree and drew strength from his ever dependable solidity and the power of his faith in her.  On that night she thanked Father Innoruuk for the blessing of having the same blood in her veins as this marvellous rock of a man and she replied:
</P>

<P>
&quot;O my matchless brother, my will is to destroy the filth who have harmed all that we cherish.  Their victory has led them to uncloak themselves, thinking us lost.  Send what remain of our finest masters and mistresses of disguise into the city; we shall catch some minnows in our nets which will lead us to their larger masters.  Then, when we perceive them truly, shall we will make their triumph but ashes in their mouths.&quot;
</P>

<P>
That following night, a noble of the warrior elite decided to visit the Dark Pleasure, one of the finest brothels in Caerthiel.  His tongue loosened by wine, he let slip to the courtesan sharing his bed of his future position in the New Order, given the close relationship he had with the new dictator.  The courtesan flushed with pleasure at serving so important and man, and sent for a bottle of the finest wine the brothel maintained in its cellars.  Thus did they further celebrate the warrior-noble’s good fortune until, sated beyond redemption, the warrior -noble fell asleep in her slender arms.
</P>

<P>
He awoke to a gag being forced into his mouth, his arms forced together and bound with silk cords.  His eyes widened in fear as he looked up at his captors, two lean men garbed in shadows and wearing black leather masks.  At the door to the pleasure chamber stood the courtesan, contempt and loathing twisting the comeliness of her features, and next to her a tall Teir’Dal who carried death itself in her amber eyes.  A promise of menace lay beneath the surface of the woman’s clear, emotionless voice, and this promise raked at his ears as she spoke thusly to her two aides:
</P>

<P>
&quot;Take him to the safehouse. I shall preside over his excruciations myself.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Then did they strike him from behind, and all went black.  The warrior-noble awoke thereafter in chains, in the largish chamber of flickering lights and damp stone that had served as sanctuary to Dencarja and the others.  The operative at the Dark Pleasure had done well.  She would be rewarded when this would all end.  Dencarja stood still as a statue before the helpless warrior-noble, flanked as ever by her loyal ebon masked aides.  A small table and a chair stood aside in a corner.  There was nothing else for the warrior-noble to see but the flames of their hatred for what he represented.  His heavy cloth tabard, adorned with the black hand symbol of the rebellion, had been torn from his livery and now lay in a puddle of filth in a corner.  And Dencarja drank in the unease of the warrior-noble, as a connoisseur of wine would savor a priceless vintage, and calmly intoned:  
</P>

<P>
&quot;You will tell me what I wish to know, and you will tell it me tonight.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The warrior-noble’s response was in the form of blood-tinged gobbet of spit hawked at Dencarja’s feet.
</P>

<P>
Dencarja nodded gravely and pulled the chair close to the manacled warrior-noble.  Twirling it around, she sat gracefully down, resting her arms upon the back of the chair.  For several heartbeats did she sit in awful silence, her gleaming eyes probing deeply into the wary eyes of the helpless Teir’Dal.  The sudden snap of her fingers to summon her aides shattered the quiet like the crack of doom itself. 
</P>

<P>
Without taking her eyes from the Warrior-Noble, Dencarja the Huntress then quietly stated:
</P>

<P>
&quot;I shall require a lit candle, a pouch of salt, and a dull skinning knife.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The warrior-noble is said to have blanched the color of early twilight, the aides immediately saluting and leaving to procure the desired items.  Dencarja’s eyes narrowed, her piercing gaze transfixing the rapidly panicking Teir’Dal.
</P>

<P>
&quot;We shall begin with you telling me about the membership and defenses of the Hand of Destiny...&quot;
</P>

<P>
Of the Destiny of the Hand
</P>

<P>
The warrior-noble’s information led to the taking and interrogation of others.  Drained dry of intelligence, they were then killed, their bodies hidden in the sewers of the city.  Twenty of these rebels thus disappeared, to the concern of their commanders, and then House V’ree struck.
</P>

<P>
Caerthiel had never known a time such as this.  The chaos following the death of the Imperator, which its arrests and executions and seizure of power by Curmsa T’rubus was terrible indeed.  This was worse.  For two sevendays were the nights rife with silent death and terror.  The citizenry locked themselves within their homes and listened to the cries of death.  Every morning, the streets were littered with the bodies of the rebellious Hand.  It was as if some gruesome plague struck during the night.  And the leaders of the Hand grew fearful, and knew.
</P>

<P>
House V’ree had returned, and it had brought the Abyss to Caerthiel.
</P>

<P>
Form alleyways, from rooftops, from cunning disguises and stratagems did House V’ree wage this silent, secret war upon the Hand of Destiny.  We killed and killed and killed.  To mark our disdain, we took from them their standards, their dark flags emblazoned with the black symbol of the Hand.  Perhaps you have seen them displayed here and there within the Hall.  We keep them still to teach us of the sin of our own arrogance, and to remind us of the need for eternal vigilance. 
</P>

<P>
By the end of this campaign, House V’ree had been diminished by more than a third of its number, but the Hand had suffered such attrition so as to cripple it beyond repair.  Curmsa T’rubus and his followers, never securely in power to begin with, now faced in opposition not only House V’ree but the citizenry of the Empire as well.  It is inherent in our people that we cannot abide the sin of failure, not in ourselves and most certainly not in others.  Curmsa and his Hand reeked of this stench and the Teir’Dal finally shook off the madness that had grown over the centuries and once more donned the mantle of pride and nobility.  Curmsa and what remained of the conspirators fled the city of Caerthiel, the restored forces of the Empire having slain their traitorous brethren and howling for their heads.

To the Mountains of Steam  fled one Vlie G’Aicinam, a high ranking Priest of Innoruuk and one of the chief conspirators, or ‘fingers’, of the Hand.  We found him and killed him.  To the Cauldron fled two more ‘fingers’.  They were both shadowknights, one Derdom E’yalf and one Romgna Y’fael.  Isumar V’ree and his lieutenants dispatched both them and what remained of their followers.  It is said that Romgna Y’fael boasted to Isumar V’ree that she had in fact disguised herself as a courtesan and killed the Imperator, having been brought to the Golden Room by the Traitor, how had murdered the man who had so faithfully stood guard at its door.  It is written that Isumar V’ree much later in life remarked that never before and never since had he encountered so beautiful a woman as Romgna Y’fael ... nor one so in need of killing.

Curmsa T’rubus was captured in the mountains of Butcherblock.  he was taken in chains back to Caerthiel and for trial and execution.  It never took place.  On the eve of the trial, the prison was stormed by an angry mob led by the surviving members of the Great Houses Curmsa had decimated,  and by their furious hands was Curmsa T’rubus  torn to pieces and left to rot in the streets.  His stately mansion, House T’rubus, was looted and afterwards burned to the ground.  A witness to that destruction tells of a room within the mansion, a terrible room which contained as trophies, three black leather faceguards and four severed hands, one on a golden pillow.  The flames took this room as they took the rest of House T’rubus, so we cannot confirm this statement.
</P>

<P>
But it sets us to anger still, and always will.
</P>

<P>
Of the Fate of the Traitor
</P>

<P>
As for the Traitor ... well.
</P>

<P>
Dencarja knew his mind now, and she knew he had realized that there was no city, no village, no tent nor cave in the Empire in which he could hide and be safe.  You see, Curmsa T’rubus had been caught by not thinking far enough, for Butcherblock was but the steppingstone to escape, and not the place itself.  Dencarja knew that the Traitor would make all haste to the docks operating at Butcherblock, in an effort to put an ocean between him and his relentless pursuers, and seek life in the uncharted wilds of the continent of Tunaria.
</P>

<P>
Which is why Dencarja the Huntress left the hunting of the other conspirators to the rest of House V’ree and set out with her ever-loyal aides to run the Traitor to the ground. 
</P>

<P>
Dencarja arrived at the docks as a ship was in preparation to leave.  She immediately boarded it and had it searched from top to bottom, ordering all aboard to remain and be silent upon pain of death.  This last order was reaffirmed after two sailor attempted to leave.  Both were killed quite instantly.  Another comrade immediately confessed that they had been bribed to by the Traitor to smuggle him aboard.  Cursing his fellows, who had disobeyed Dencarja in order to warn the Traitor, the young sailor declared undying loyalty to the Empire and told Dencarja where the Traitor could be found.  Dencarja V’ree therefore ordered the sailor to hold fast the boat and all aboard her from leaving Butcherblock Dock until she returned.  If he so did, she would make of him a captain. If he did not ... well, the sailor would not dare to disobey so fine and noble a lady, and he said so with great tremors of fear tripping his voice.
</P>

<P>
They found the Traitor sitting at drink at a table in the Port Authority.  He sat, hooded and unobtrusive, blending in with the other pilgrims and soldiers awaiting the boat.  Not four paces into the hall did they proceed, when the Traitor kicked the table before him and sent a throwing knife at Dencarja V’ree.
</P>

<P>
And one of Dencarja’s aides, the swifter of the two, brought his body before that of Dencarja.  The knife struck home deep within his noble chest, and he fell lifeless at Dencarja’s feet.  His name had been Yalol U’ter, and we honor him still for his fierce loyalty to Dencarja the Huntress and House V’ree.
</P>

<P>
Therefore did Dencarja stand as still as stone over the body of her most valiant aide, and asked of the Traitor but a single word:
</P>

<P>
&quot;Why?&quot;
</P>

<P>
And the Traitor grinned at Dencarja.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Curmsa promised to make me a noble,&quot; the Traitor stated casually, &quot;With the lands and wealth of a Great House. What could House V’ree offer me, Dencarja?  Surely nothing so lofty as that.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Therefore did Dencarja pause, and the eyes she directed at the Traitor with blazed like hot coals, dispelling the darkness that shrouded them.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Indeed, once my husband,&quot; she then said, in a voice low and tight with cold loathing, &quot;You are quite correct.  House V’ree could only offer you what we have always offered our children, both natural and adopted: Life, Loyalty, and Service to the Throne.&quot;
</P>

<P>
&quot;Alas,&quot; she continued, the words growling from the confines of her throat, &quot;We cannot offer even that any more.  Now we can only promise you doom.  And, unlike Curmsa T’rubus, we will keep our promises.&quot;
</P>

<P>
The Traitor then laughed harshly.  &quot;Perhaps,&quot; he admitted to her grudgingly, &quot;But not tonight.&quot;
</P>

<P>
And the Traitor turned as if to flee.  At the last moment, he dropped to his knees and, with possibly the finest throw in a career distinguished by his uncanny acumen with projectile weapons, he sent a flat throwing knife whirring on an impossibly swift, unerringly perfect course for Dencarja’s left eye.
</P>

<P>
If it had not actually been witnessed ... well.  O my colleague, there are many wonders in the world: some of which are seen and some of which are not.  One of the greatest of these is the neverending marvel of what a manaless mortal body is capable of doing when it must act or die.  Dencarja stood in the path of the knife as a graven image, not moving, perhaps not even breathing.  Yet, when the blade came to perhaps a mere handsbreath away from her eye, Dencarja’s arm ... just her arm, mind you ... blurred beyond mortal eyes to follow, plucking the blade out of its intended path and returning it to its master.  It sheathed itself in the warm stomach of the Traitor, fouling his escape and tumbling him down in agony, his hands clutching at the protruding hilt.  Perhaps never in the history of Norrath had such a remarkable move been made, and perhaps never again can it ever be repeated.
</P>

<P>
Dencarja is said to have then looked down her aquiline nose at this moaning, thrice-damnable wretch and hissed two words to her surviving aide: 
</P>

<P>
&quot;Take him.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Our records show that the Traitor died after nine sevendays of torture, and that what remained of his body was left to rot at the foot of the crypt of Guildmaster Arceas V’ree.  When the scavengers had picked it clean of flesh, House V’ree donated the whitened bones to the necromancers, that the Traitor exist in eternal pain and servitude as a loathsome pet.  My heart smiles to think of the agony of the Traitor, bound by unimaginable pain to his bleached skeletal remains ... awake, aware, but helpless to do anything but obey the unspeakable whims of his terrible new masters.
</P>

<P>
Thus did House V’ree revenge itself upon the Traitor, and woe to any who should emulate him.
</P>

<P>
There is a rumor that one of the of the relics saved during the Flight of Fury were the bone chips of the Traitor, and that the necromancers still maintain him in pain-ridden, undead servitude.  Whether this is factual or otherwise I cannot say.  Only the necromancers know and they neither confirm nor deny the rumor.  Personally, I like to believe it to be true.  
</P>

<P>
What is it you ask?  What of Dencarja (whom we now honor with the sobriquet of &quot;the Scourge&quot;)?  She resigned the post of Guildmistress in favor of her older brother Isumar V’ree, soon after the coronation of Imperatrix Zhelebati Thex the Avenger.  She became the personal bodyguard and confidant to the Imperatrix, and served her well as both vassal and friend.
</P>

<P>
Damned forever be the soul of the Traitor, may his reward of pain be for Eternity and a sevenday.<BR>
Praise be to the memory of Dencarja the Scourge, who avenged our House, and preserved an Empire.<BR>
</P>

<P>
Rest now, fellow rogue.  The remainder of our history will wait for another evening.
