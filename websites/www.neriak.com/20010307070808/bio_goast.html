On a misty night in the Steam Font Mountains close to the city of AK'anon,
in a shack owned by two young Gnomish clerics a child gasps for its first
breath and begins to cry. Outside smiles cross the lips of three darkly clad
individuals, anticipation is quickening to a sense of near fulfillment.
</P>

<P>
The trio is an unlikely assortment of races, bound together for a common
cause. The Gnome, old and withered walks forward tword the door confident
that his task will be successful. Three knocks and the door opens to reveal
a proud father who has used his clerical power to heal his bride during and
after the delivery. The smile on the darkly clad Gnome grows increasingly
broad, the green tint to his hair and eyebrows catches the light and the new
father realizes that this is not a social call. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Says the
Visitor with all gratitude, then with a motion of his hands the young cleric
panics and flees his house, unable to overcome the terror that has filled
his mind. Awaiting him is an Erudite and a Dark Elf. Aside from the panic,
the last thought the young cleric has is of his newborn son.
</P>

<P>
The new mother, tired but in full health looks to the doorway as her husband
departs. &quot;Kail what is wrong?&quot; she says before she notices the visitor. &quot;He
felt the need to run.&quot; Says the gnome in a simple way. &quot;I am Zephilar, These
are my associates, and you will now die.&quot; Again in a simple manner with just
a lilt of pleasure measuring the final syllables. &quot;No, don't take our child,
let him live.&quot; Groveled the young widow, now understanding that her life was
soon to be taken. &quot;We shall make him as undead as possible false believer.&quot;
This time something akin to sympathy crept into the gnomes voice. &quot;No!&quot;
screamed the mother &quot;I will not allow him to fall into your evil hands!&quot; she
declared with all her hear. Tears streaked her face as she sought to armor
her child knowing that her life was forfeit. The three visitors acted as
one, and while the child was being cloaked with holy armor, it became an
orphan.
</P>

<P>
The three visitors closed the door behind them as they left, feeling
refreshed and full of life. &quot;Why do they call us evil tall one&quot; said the
Zephilar to the erudite. &quot;I think they lack understanding of our arts.&quot;
Shrugged the Erudite with a smile. &quot;Because they fear us gnome, we represent
all that they attempt to deny&quot; the Dark elf responded filled with pride. The
three moved with stealth as they made there way through Fedwyr en-route to
Antiocia, and the Festival of Bertoxxulous.
</P>

<P>
Many days passed as the three moved in and out of shadows with seemingly
inexhaustible energy. The desert heat taxed that energy hard, and a campsite
was made so that they might regain there enrgy for the final crossing, and
the Festival which was being held in the Innothule swamp. &quot;Why was a Gnome
child chosen, and why the child of Clerics?&quot; asked the Dark elf. The
Erudite, perhaps the most intelligent of the three was first to answer.
&quot;Gnomes are strong and can better withstand the draining. A Cleric has power
as we all know, turning that power to our uses will be an incredible fiat.&quot;
&quot;Yes, I think Bertolous will be pleased&quot; declared Zephilar. The child though
starved and thirsty wimpered weakly as if to protest. &quot;Think I should give
him some of my life's energy? Just to see him through to the festival of
course.&quot; Said the Drow. &quot;No! You must not! All will be forfeit with such an
act.&quot; Zephilar's eyes glared red then returned to normal after his
pronouncement. &quot;We must move on. The transference cannot be delayed too long
lest we loose the child.&quot; Breaking camp the three feasted upon the life
energies of madmen and alligators to sustain them on their journey.
</P>

<P>
The three were met by two Shadow nights upon entering the swamp, mistaking
the Gnome for something to eat the Ogre Shadow night quickly found himself
to be humbled at the feet of Zephilar. &quot;Do not tempt me to fiest upon your
flesh this day Ogre, it has been a long journey.&quot; Cowed, and properly put in
his place the Ogre fell to the rear of the party were he could guard them,
and better yet, avoid turning his back on the gnome. Shortly the group of
five was joined by four shaman and the entourage moved on to the heart of
the festival grounds to meet with the remaining two Erudite shadow nights,
and two Dark Elf necromancers. They discussed how to properly begin the
ceremony.
</P>

<P>
As the festival was reaching its peak, and the moon rose high above the
swamp hidden from festival participants by the thick leaves of the broad
based trees the shaman began to chant. The four shadow nights moved into
position with there hands engulfing the small dessicated and withering form
of the gnome orphan. The Necromancers formed a ring about the child equally
spaced while the shaman danced around them in a weave that encircled all the
rest. &quot;Bertolous! We ask for power that we may give you this gift!&quot; Shouted
Zephilar so that all could hear him. &quot;Ub, Shud we do it now?&quot; queried One of
the Shadow knights. &quot;I will tell you when&quot; hissed Zephilar intent on gauging
the precice moment. The shaman songs were reaching there zenith and Zephilar
felt that it was time. Without word the shaman stopped abruptly, the shadow
knights moved as one and used their dark touch on the child. Instantly the
Necromancers poured there energies into keeping the child on the brink of
death each draining themselves in the process. The shaman healed the
necromancers and the shadow knights began a dance of there own, a deadly and
ancient dance of sacrifice. Swords held high, blades weaving as the large
creatures pounded the ground with ritual patterns that even they did not
understand. The nearly exhausted and weakend Zephilar motioned to the shaman
and they began to give spirit energy to the motionless child. The shadow
knights dance flowed freely, almost gracefully around the child until all at
once they jumped in the air, their blades held high above the child. It was
at this point they abruptly died, there lives stolen by the necromancers for
the energy it would give them. The shaman quickly began to heal the
necromancers, who in turn poured every ounce of life they had into the
child. Four swords slashed downward from the now dead hands of the shadow
knights, Four deadly blades slice through the child and into the stone below
it. Four dead necromancers lay in a circle surrounding the shadow knights
and the orphan. Four exhausted Shaman stared in wonder at a sight they had
never before seen.

<P>
A Gnomish Baby, still so young that its umbilical was not fully healed stood
laughing on the Alter. &quot;I Tink dats a Goast&quot; Uttered the one of the two
Troll Shaman. An Ogre Shaman, not to be outdone nodded and said &quot;Yab dat ids
name, Goast. Me eat it now?&quot; Laughter echoed through the night as an erudite
Necromancer stepped forward from the shadows. &quot;No Ogre, but soon, it may
dine on you.&quot; With a smile of sheer pleasure the tall one picked up the
child and said &quot;Goast how truly fitting.&quot; Calling upon a nearby Dark Elf
Wizard The erudian necro said &quot;Take us to Tox, this one will need training.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Before the Portal could open, before many words could be spoken, the childs
eyes flared red briefly, and a smile crossed his lips
