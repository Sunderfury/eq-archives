<P>
Hello..you may have seen me once or twice before, but
rest assured you will see a lot more of me. Soon I
will rise to power, and smite down all enemies to my
lord Innoruuk and myself. I know you may ask yourself
how could a lowly magic user as yourself become one
with Innoruuk, the God of Hate? Sit down then my
friend, and enter into the true Norrath.
</P>

<P>
First of all, I suppose you should know my name, but
that all depends on which way you see me. You see, as
I have said, Innoruuk has become one with me; a merger
of this massive importance would not only change your
appearance, but your soul,body, and mind. Included in
this would be my name, allowing me to have a
pre-Innoruuk and a post-Innoruuk name. If you had
known me from before, your would most likely recognize
the name of Kenlerdamain, and you should. Yes, I am
the same Kenlerdamain, the son of Bledartisk, head
paladin for the vile Mithaniel Marr. After Innoruuk
found me, ( or rather I found Innoruuk) my name became
altered to Kenamael, Bringer of Hate in the forgotten
language of evil. I know what you may think by looking
at my skin alone, how can your father be Bledartisk?
Well calm your mind friend, and let it recieve the
story of my creation.
</P>

<P>
Yes, my father was the one and only Bledartisk,
devouted paladin to Mithaniel Marr, so devouted in
fact, he forgot his own son. His utter disgust in the
dark races, drove him to what most would consider
maddness. He would awake every morning before sun
rise, then come back home far after sun set; he
claimed he was ridding Norrath of the Vile Elves, but
I knew different though. He hated me from my birth, he
never wanted a child, nor did mother; they simply
wanted to show their love for all to see. When I came,
I was more of a nusance than anything. My father would
at time remark on my &quot;abnormal way&quot; , but I was truely
just interested in the ways of &quot;altering magic&quot;. I
only wished to give a good show for my friends and
become loved by all, but that all changed one day.
</P>

<P>
After years of study, an odd man entered our town.
He donned a mystical robe of the holy colors of Marr.
My father must have allowed him into this place
because of this. I remember all of my friends talking
of him being evil, and being able to destroy a man's
mind. Of course within a week, the entire town was a
buzz of his powers, so my father told me to stay away
from that man at all cost. He said he didn't know what
the man's power was, but he just couldn't attack the
man. Well, this was all I needed to know, that very
night my father and I got into our usual fight, I
forget what it was this night, but it upset me just
the same. After a long yelling match. I grabbed the
torch and set off to this &quot;odd&quot; man. When I arrived at
his house, oddly he was still awake chanting
something. That is when I looked upon the wall, and I
saw the greatest sight ever.
</P>

<P>
There on the wall was a painting of  Innoruuk, and
beneath this was the mystical man, but there was
something wrong with him. His skin was the color of
night! I had never seen this before, all I had ever
seen were elves with the color of milk, or that close
to a human's. I suppose it was my gasp which gave me
away, but he turned and faced me with his red eyes,
making me want to run. To my suprise though I couldn't
I was unable to run; and to that unable to do
anything. This man walked up to me, grabbed me by my
throat and lifted me in the air. I for sure thought I
would die, but that wasn't in the cards....yet. 
</P>

<P>
I was there dangling 3 feet above the ground from a
man with red eyes, needless to say I was scared, and
thinking it would be the last word I spoke I yelled at
the top of my lungs, &quot;I HATE YOU!&quot; This is when he
smiled at me, dropped me to the ground and spoke to me
in some odd language. I suppose he could tell I had no
idea what he was saying, because soon he was telling
me his name in my own tounge. He said he was Zakaii,
and his other friend was Nebula. I thought for a
second that he must mean the being in the picture was
named Nebula, but about this time, another dark skined
elf appeared right before me. He introduced himself as
Nebula. He said that he was a sort of magic user that
could alter how he appeared or if he did at all, that
was why I couldn't see him. This was the man I had
looked forward to meeting.....he knew the &quot;altering
magic&quot;.
</P>

<P>
After much discussion between the two, they turned to
me and asked of my name, who I was, etc. I told them
all they wanted to know, partially because I was
frightened of these red eyed, black skined
individuals, but also because I was partially
fascinated with them. They learned who my father was
and soon began to talk in an odd language once more.
At this time Zakaii asked me if I truely had hatred
within my body. I told him yes, ( of course I had
hatred...my father had spent his entire life hating me
and keeping theses nice people away from me). He then
lifted my arm and sliced the tips of my fingers with a
dagger he had. My blood dropped on the ground, and
soon Zakaii had a small amount of it rubbed all over
his hands. At this time, he walked over to the picture
and went back into  chant.
</P>

<P>
He arose about ten minuted later, and now to my
suprise...the blood on hands was now black as his
skin. He smiled at me, and said that there was still
hope. He said that if I wished there was a way for
Innoruuk to accept me. Well I smiled very widely ad
told him how great t was, but I had no idea who this
Innoruuk was at the time. Nebula was able to read my
mind, he told Zakaii something again in the odd
tounge, and then they both burst into laughter. Zakaii
apologized for his stupidity and set me down to
explain who Innoruuk was. He told me Innoruuk was the
&quot;father&quot;, and he had an absolute power over any Dark
Elf. Nebula laughed at this, but Zakaii shot him a
glare which kept him quite for almost the rest of the
conversation. He then proceded in telling me all about
the wonders of Innoruuk. When he was done I turned to
Nebula who was at the time messing with a backpack and
some kind of fur in the corner at the time. I  then
walked up to him and asked the most important question
in my life.
</P>

<P>
I am sure I had to of stuttered once or twice while
talking to him, but I was able to finally choke out if
he could show me how to do the &quot;altering magic&quot;. He
told me there was no problem, but it would require
alot of work and would require me to come to his house
almost everyday for teachings. I quickly agreed to
these terms, when Zakaii said he could also teach me
the ways of Innoruuk while I was there everyday. I was
fascintaed with this Innoruuk, so I said that it would
be my pleasure. This ended our little session and
before I even knew it I was back at my house. My
father was still there and in a mood, so  decided not
to confront him for this night. 
</P>

<P>
	I did just as I had agreed to do with these Dark
Elves, everyday I would go over to their house for 4
hours. Two hours Nebula would teach me magic, and two
hours Zakaii would teach me prayers and Innoruuk's
teachings. Needless to say, soon my father saw a
change in my behavior, and soon he grew weery of me. 
</P>

<P>
Well it was an average day, when my I went to
Zakaii's house, but today was a special day for me and
Nebula..he was going to show me a very neat spell
where I could make myself look like on of them. I
arrived at the house, and within an hour I had the
beautiful skin of night and the glowing red eyes of
Innoruuk. I had just become this way when my father
burst through the door. 
</P>

<P>
&quot;DARK ELF SCUM!!!&quot; he yelled.
</P>

<P>
He pulled out his sword and proceded to slice off
Nebula's head. Zakaii let out a horrible yell, but
soon he was on the floor as well. Then my own father
faced me. I begged for my life and told him I was his
son, but before I could hear anything I was at the
feet of Innoruuk, standing next to Nebula and Zakaii.
His awesome size made me fear for my life, but I
strangly felt calm with him. He looked down at me and
said in the odd tounge he knew I had changed my
foolish ways. I was now suprised....i could understand
the odd tounge, ad he told me it was Dark Elven. He
said that he had looked over me for these past months
and noticed me following him very well, and for this
he would reward me greatly. He said that I would never
have to fear the pain of death again, that in fact
that I woud no longer know death. He further explained
to me that now I would spawn at one specific place
everytime I would die by some odd chance. 
</P>

<P>
It was all so clear to me now. I was put on this
earth to be a servant of Innoruuk! I  dropped down to
my knees and begged him to let me become a priest in
his name. He looked down at me, and replied in a low
growling voice that I couldn't because if I got
everything I wanted I would lose hatred, but I could
become the most hated of people ever in Norrath. He
them looked at hallway and yelled out for some man
named Maestro. Soon I was approached by a being that
looked something like me, but he was dressed in a
cloak and crown, and he had fangs rather than normal
teeth. 
</P>

<P>
He reached out his hand, and touched my forehead. I
was soon absorbing knowledge I never knew existed. I
saw the dark arts in all their glory, and realized I
was the one truely powerful being.... the Necromancer.
Maestro soon told me all about my job as a
necromancer, or as he called it a necro. He soon
handed me three sheets of paper and told me to be on
my way.
</P>

<P>
I awoke then in the glorious city of Neriak, my new
found home. I was unfamiliar to the surrounding so I
began to search, soon I found a group of people who
were like me, and accepted any necromancer they saw of
the dark skin. I was told to go out, gain my strength
and bring respect to my class.  This is what I have
done for these past months. I have gained power, and
become that much closer to Innoruuk, all  while
avenging my very first death. I grow closer to my
father's power with every creature I destroy, and soon
I will meet him, returning the favor. This time I will
meet him under a new name though, Kenamael, the
necromancer. For those of you who have studied you
will realize it as the Bringer of Hate in the old
language, and if not, you now know. This is a promise
I keep though, Hate will follow me wherever I go, and
soon I will be united with Innoruuk again.
