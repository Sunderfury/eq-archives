		March 14th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>***EverQuest Turns Two***<p>Two years ago this Friday, EverQuest was launched, forever changing the course of online gaming.  Today EverQuest boasts nearly 360,000 active subscribers, and a two-year retention rate of 65%.  Peak usage tops 89,000 simultaneous users with average peak usage at roughly 87,000.  The EverQuest community continues to grow daily.  <p>We've put up a page on the EverQuest website to help celebrate EverQuest's achievement and to thank our loyal fans.  Over the next couple of days we will be posting interesting content from EverQuest's humble beginnings, as well as a few surprises.  Check it out!  http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp<p>*Ever Changing, Evolving, Expanding*<p>The Warrens:<p>As part of our two-year celebration, we're pleased to announce the release of "The Warrens", a free expansion zone located on Odus. "The Warrens" is a low-to-mid level dungeon and the home of the Kobolds on Odus.  You can patch the Warrens by running the "Optional Patch". <p>In addition to filling-out the continent of Odus, "the Warrens" will also serve as a platform to try out some of the new ideas brought forth by members of the team and the public aimed at addressing some common gameplay issues.  We would like to see what options might be open to and enjoyed by the players in the future.<p>The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher level characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level creatures.  To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that "outclasses" a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP.  All other loot will drop.  "Outclassing" a foe is defined as having a group makeup such that no one in your group receives experience from the kill.  This can happen if, for instance, the foe is "green" to all group members, or if the group makeup is of such a wide level range that the system determines the fight was unbalanced using regular experience rules.<p>Any time that an NPC would have dropped special loot and does not due to it being outclassed, a message indicating that the combat was "trivial" will be displayed to the group. <p>As time goes on, we will be implementing new gameplay subsets and adjustements in the Warrens.  Please be sure to let us know what you think!<p>The Planes:<br> <br>The Planes of Fear and Hate have been updated as part of our two-year celebration.  Adventurers in the Plane of Fear will notice that some high-level foes are now available.  Rewards for former "boss npcs" have been moved down to underlings that are roughly as powerful as the old bosses were.<p>The Plane of Hate has also received a large update, but this one also includes the opening of a previously undiscovered part of the zone, now full high-level expansion-oriented content.  Much as with Fear, rewards from bosses have been moved.  <p>Epic Quests:<p>As part of the Plane updates, we've made several adjustments to Epic quests for a number of classes.  Previously, questers of many classes were put in direct competition with regular non-questing adventurers for a few coveted spawns.  In these cases, a new step has been added to separate the "Epic Encounter" NPCs from the "Epic Quest" NPCs.  <p>For those who are mid-quest, all quest requirements have remained the same.  In other words, if you turn the same items into the same NPC, the same reward applies.  What has changed is that some components may be in a different location from where you expect them.  It is recommended that you check with the last NPC in line or other adventurers to find where you need to go next.<p>***Patch Day***<p>Along with the big announcements above, today was a patch day as well:<p>- Fixed a bug that allowed exploitation of the period of time between character control being established and loading of character faction tables.<br>- Fixed the Dagger of Frost.  Its special item flags were improperly removed in the last patch.<br>- The spell, Mark of Karn, has been enhanced to heal more per hit.<br>- The effect on the Celestial Elixir Breastplates has been changed to the enhanced Mark of Karn.  The casting time on these items has also been changed to 9 seconds.<br>- NPCs in Thurgadin will no longer stop traveling when you /hail them.<br>- Fixed a problem present in Nagafen's Lair and the Plane of Hate that caused framerate to drop over time.<br>- Shift-clicking on a stack of items will cause you to pick up the whole stack.  This is in addition to CTRL-clicking on a stack, which will cause you to pick up one.  These both also work for coins now as well as items.<br>- In addition to the above, holding down the shift key while clicking the "Sell" button in the vendor screen will cause you to sell the entire stack of items if a stack is selected.  For example, you can sell 20 peridots by selecting the stack, and shift-clicking "Sell".  I'd recommend though that you give them to your neighborhood cleric first though :)  The ability to buy stacks is on the list for implementation in the near future.<br>- There are a ton of new recipies for trade skill users out there.  Check your books.  <br>- There are a bunch of new quests as well.<br>- It appears that we fixed a bug with the Mend skill that caused it to be unavailable for a few seconds after it was supposed to be ready for use.  Let us know if there are any further problems.<br>- Foraging items will now yield a message giving you some idea of what you've foraged.<p>Please remember that the /movelog for the Rathe and E'ci is scheduled for this weekend.  Please read the message below for details on the /movelog.<p>*A Message From Customer Service*<p>We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters moved from one server to another, or from one account to another.  Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and other problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters across servers or accounts.  <p>It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server remain on that server.  We also feel that it is important that characters that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from that reputation by changing servers.<p>The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a large number of characters to new servers.  At no other time will we move a character in such a fashion.<p>- The EverQuest Team<br>

		March 6th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>*The Fan Faire comes home!*<p>The next EverQuest Fan Faire will be held April 6 - April 7, 2001 at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We expect this one to sell out quicker than Baltimore not only because the weather will be warmer, but also because it's a safe bet to say you'll get to meet even more Verant personalities since our offices are local. Don't delay with registration because you may get left out! <p>The registration deadline is March 28th.  Go to http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire for details.<p><br>***Patch Day***<p>*General Changes*<p>-- Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200. <br>-- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal's Breatplate on others once casted upon yourself.<br>-- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs<br>-- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book or alt+b.<br>-- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.<br>-- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on Antonica and two others on Kunark.  NPCs at these locations can fill you in on the details.  Good hunting.<br>-- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the "Celestial Healing" effect has been increased to one minute.  We understand that this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch.  We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on the group tank.  When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those items retroactively.  <br>-- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill values over 100.  Values under 100 still show the qualitative identifiers.<br>-- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other players.  You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players by typing /inspect. <br>-- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over the chat window.<br>-- Fixed "Breath of the Sea". It was mistakenly set to be unresistable.<br>-- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone.  This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists and clean up your pet.<br>-- "Voice Graft" will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of your pet.<br>-- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.<br>-- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125.  It was the intent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better.  With the tracking improvements from the last patch, this increase was appropriate.<br>-- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.<p>*NPC AI Adjustments*<p>-- Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt creatures that are level 60 to 65.  Previously, players could only taunt creatures below their level.<br>-- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies.  Prior to this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this.  This is why NPCs would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.<br>-- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much "temporary hate" when a player would sit down in front of them.<br>-- The maximum amount of "hate" that an NPC can add when witnessing a heal to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<br>-- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number of hitpoints healed.  Previously, healing one hitpoint would cause one point of hate.  Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate.<p>*Velious Music*<p>Velious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood music for some Velious Zones.  Let us know what you think of the new compositions. <p>*EQGems*<p>A new "mini-game" has been added to the EverQuest client.  EQGems is our first effort aimed towards allowing people to engage in different activities while playing EverQuest.  Based upon the success of EQGems, we may explore opportunities for other mini-games in the future, even some that are multiplayer in and of themselves.  Type /gems to play.<p>- The EverQuest Team<p>

		January 9th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>***Patch Day***<p>We're happy to present today's patch, which focuses primarily on addressing issues that have been brought forth by EverQuest players.  We appreciate the opportunity to spend some time focusing on specific issues important to you.  Today's patch includes the following:<p>*Disciplines*<p>- The "Resistant" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 1.<br>- The "Holy Forge" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 2.<br>- The "Weaponshield" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.<br>- The "Leechcurse" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.<br>- The "Deftdance" Discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.<br>- The "Puretone" Discipline now lasts 4 minutes instead of the previous 2.<br>- The "Sanctification" discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.<br>- The "Unholy Aura" Discipline now gives a 50% bonus to Harmtouch (compared with the previous 25%) and causes it to save versus disease, which should result in even fewer resists in most high-level encounters.<p>*Spells*<p>- "Lay on Hands" has been improved starting at 40th level.<br>- The "Summon Corpse" spell is now available to Shadowknights.<br>- Corrected a bug that was causing damage while using the "Trueshot" Discipline to be the same regardless of the quality of your bow.<br>- The spells "Focus of Spirit" and "Visions of Grandeur" now stack.<br>- "Harmtouch" is now resisted as if it were a "Lifetap" spell, meaning that it is all-or-nothing, and nearly unresistable with exception to encounters that are immune to magic or out of the acceptable level range.  In addition, maximum damage for Harmtouch has been increased starting at 40th level.<br>- We fixed a bug that caused "Lure" type spells (Wizards) to be resisted more than they should have been in certain types of encounters.<br>- Melee attack timers will no longer be reset when a SK, Paladin, or Ranger cast a spell.  Previously these classes had to wait a full attack delay after casting before they would attack via melee again. <p>*Miscellaneous*<p>- You may now adjust the clipping plane in the Hole.  Previously, the clipping plane was fixed.  Many people requested the ability to bring the clipping plane closer to allow them to improve their client's performance.<br>- Fixed several problems with trade-skill components that were not dropping.  Also added some new recipes.<br>- Fixed the Iksar "Shackle of Steel" quest.  <br>- The additional options for /camp (/camp server, /camp desktop) have been implemented.  /camp server will take you to the server-selection screen.  /camp desktop will cause EverQuest to terminate and take you to the desktop.<p>*Root and Snare*<p>Root-type spells and "snare" type spells now use a separate spell effect.  <p>Previously, "Root" spells would overwrite any snare effect upon the target.  When the root would wear off, the target began moving at full speed.  With this change, when root wears off, snare will still be in effect.  This has a few added effects on the other end.  <p>For instance, root will no longer cancel SoW or Journeyman's Boots effects.  It also allowed us to correct a long-standing bug that was allowing bards to cancel root on themselves by playing Selo's Accelerando if Selo's was in effect at the time that the bard was rooted.  As mentioned in a previous patch where the first part of this bug was fixed, this was not the intended effect.<p>*Looting NODROP Items*<p>A new command is now available to EverQuest players.  <p>In order to prevent the accidental looting of NODROP items, the /lootnodrop command has been added to the client.  The command supports three options:  ALWAYS (Default) - You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP item.  SOMETIMES - You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP items that your race and/or class cannot use.  NEVER - NODROP items will be looted without confirmation. <p>It is highly recommended that you DO NOT CHANGE this from the default option, as the GM staff cannot assist in cases of accidental looting.<p><br>- The EverQuest Team<br>

		December 19th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>*Patch Day*<p>Today's patch primarily consists of tuning of Velious zones as well as content and other additions.  In addition, the following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<p>- High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect have in several cases had their casting times increased.  <br>- Factions for some of the higher end encounters in Velious have received some adjustments.  Basically, "bad acts" receive more weight than "good acts".  For instance, if "A" hates "B" and "B" hates "A", killing "A" will hurt your faction with "A" more than it will help your faction with "B".<br>- The stamina reduction with "Resurrection Effects" has been replaced by a slight attack-speed debuff.<br>- The Ranger's Trueshot discipline now works correctly.  It was previously only working versus other player characters.<br>- The Shadow Knight's "Unholy Aura" discipline has received an enhancement.  When in use, harmtouch resistances will be checked versus disease instead of magic.  In addition, harmtouch will resist in the same fashion as lifetap spells, meaning that unless the creature is immune to disease, you should get full damage most of the time.<br>- The spell attached to the "Fiery Defender" can now be partially resisted instead of being "all or nothing".  The net result is that the average damage will be higher.<br>- The Paladin "Holy Forge" discipline will now give paladins triple the normal chance of scoring a critical hit.  Each critical hit has a percent chance to be scored as a critical blow.<br>- Added parameters to the /camp command (the command that will cause you to camp out if you are already sitting).  "/camp server" will take you back to the server selection screen.  "/camp desktop" will take you out to the desktop following a successful camp.  Despite popular request, "/camp spawn" will not be implemented.<br>- Walruses now indeed sound like they should.<br>- Added the /chatfontsize [0 to 5] (default is 1) command.  This command will allow players to adjust the size of the font in the chat window.<p><br>- The EverQuest Team<p>

		November 29th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>*Patch Day*<p>Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay issues:<p>- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum.  Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction.<p>- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player character rather than an NPC.  The change last patch reduced them to a rate below player characters.  As part of this patch, target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the intended type.  For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything.  <p>- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few minutes.  For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this should address the issue.<p>- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards.  Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it.  <p>- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting to get back in.<p>- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping is enabled.  Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is adopted.<p>- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace".  This means that you can now assign "Backspace" to a function in game.<p>- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances.  There is still a potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near future.<p>- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while.<p>- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons.  The calculation used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability.  It is possible that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet that will not have this ability. <p>- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant.  Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune.<p>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill.<p>Remember!
