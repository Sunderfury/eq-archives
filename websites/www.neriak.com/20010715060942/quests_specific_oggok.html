<STRONG>The Shamen of War</STRONG><BR>
Zulort
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Zulort, well, he will tell you the Warlord, needs 4 Froglok Tadpole Flesh.  One gets the feeling that he may eat them himself, by the amount of salivation while he talks.  These are easily gotten while hunting in the swamps or off of vendors. You will get raised faction with the Shamen of War, and the Burst of Flame spell.

Marda
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Directs you to go and serve Grevak of the Greenblood Knights and indicates that she has a secret mission to give after you've advanced 5 ranks and performed the service for Grevak. (no other information on the secret mission available)
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<STRONG>The Greenbloods Guild</STRONG><BR>
Grevak
<BLOCKQUOTE>
First, reassure him that you are a new peon and not an enemy.  He would like you to give him Four Lizardmen Tails for a reward and two Lizardman Shaman Dolls for a greater reward.  I've heard these can now be gotten from spawns in the swamp area, however it used to be that I only saw those drop in the Rathe Mountains zone off of lizards there.(specific reward and faction information not available)

Soonog

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Is REALLY hungry!  Would like 4 lizard meats (or more, but 4 at a time) to eat.  These can be found as loot off of the lizards in the Feerrot or can be purchased off of vendors. You get better faction with GreenBloodKnights and Clurg, and worse faction with StormGuard and ShadowknightsofNightKeep.

<STRONG>The Craknek</STRONG><BR>
Horgus
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Such insecure ogres!  First, reassure him that you are a Craknek, even if you are not.   Horgus *also* wants 4 lizard tails, and he promises rewards and armor for the task.  (specific reward and faction information not available)

Guntrik

He would like your help in gathering the House Crests of the Noble Hunters of Humans and Elves in the forest.  If you give him house crests, he will give you things. If you find meat, he'd like you to give them to Clurg's Cook, who will make stew from it and give coins to you in return. (specific reward and faction information not available)
