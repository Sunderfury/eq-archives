<P>Roleplaying in Everquest is hard enough -- so few people do it that it tends to 
attract a lot of attention when someone does, and not always positive attention 
at that.  If you are roleplaying an &quot;evil&quot; race it is even harder, 
because you will likely not help out the other characters since your character 
would not do that.</P>

<P>This problem is hugely compounded by the fact that a majority of EQ players 
seemingly believe they are <EM>divinely entitled</EM> to have whatever spell 
they desire cast upon them at any moment no matter the inconvenience it would 
cause the caster.  Those of you who play Druids, Shaman, or Necromancers know 
exactly what I mean -- <EM>&quot;u sow me plz !&quot; &quot;buff me 
pls!!!!&quot; &quot;find my corpse!!!!&quot;</EM>.  If you explain nicely to one 
of these players that you are doing something else, they pretty much flip out 
and call you a$$hole, jerk, or what-have-you, never realizing you are playing 
the game just like they are and sometimes you are going to just be doing 
something else and can't take time to assist them at their whim.  If you happen 
to be an evil-race roleplayer, and say something like &quot;I do not assist 
those of your ilk.&quot;, you are <EM>really</EM> in for some swearing!  Some 
people just do not understand that your <EM>character</EM> has nothing to do 
with you as a <EM>player</EM>, and they take everything done or said in 
character personally and just go insane swearing, KSing, training, and so on 
just to &quot;get back at you&quot;.</P>

<P>What it comes down to is the difference between <EM>player</EM> and 
<EM>character</EM>.  You as a player do not hate any other player (unless of 
course that player has proven to be a jerk), but your character may indeed hate 
many other characters -- be it because of their race, religion, or some other 
roleplaying background.  People must learn that in roleplaying, nothing is 
personal.  One has to do as their character would do -- this is the definition 
of roleplaying!  So Dark Elves are not going to help out a Dwarf, nor should the 
Dwarf help out Dark Elves.  It's not in character to do so -- unless there is 
something to be gained in doing it.</P>

<P>Now it may be that you are really a nice person, as a player, and have chosen to 
play a Dark Race and want to be true to the roleplaying of it, but yet you still 
want to be nice and help out in some cases.  You still can.  You just have to 
find a way to handle it in character.  For example, a Dark Elven Cleric can save 
the butt of a light race character, saying something like &quot;See the true 
power of Innoruuk and repent, FOOL!&quot; right before saving them.  Or a 
warrior can jump in and take over for someone when they get in over their head 
in a fight, saying something along the lines of &quot;Pathetic weakling, here is 
how the Indigo Brotherhood does battle!&quot;.  You don't have to always refuse 
help and stand by and watch someone die.  Usually, given the smaller communities 
of the EQ servers, you know generally who is a roleplayer and who isn't.  
Usually other roleplayers will understand if you stand by and not assist -- they 
know all about roleplaying and should not get upset should you let them die.  
Non-roleplayers will be very offended if you do not help save them, and it is 
for them that you can macro the type of sayings mentioned above and then you can 
feel free to help out.  But not always. :) Sometimes you just have to let them 
die.</P>

<P>Another thing you can do is let people know in /tells that you are indeed 
roleplaying, that nothing you say or do is personal, you are just playing your 
character properly.  I do this a lot when other people do &quot;run-by&quot; 
buffs or just randomly buff me.  I'll say &quot;Dwarven scum!  Do not taint me 
with your magicks!&quot; out loud and then /tell [whoever] thanks man! You 
can end up in some really funny conversations this way -- your two characters 
verbally berating each other out loud, whilst you two as players are having a 
friendly conversation via /tells.  :)</P>
