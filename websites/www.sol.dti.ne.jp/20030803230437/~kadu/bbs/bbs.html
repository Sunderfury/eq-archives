My tea's gone cold  I'm wondrin why I Got out of bed at all <br>
The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all <br>
</td></tr></table><br>

<table><tr><td>
And even if I could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall <br>
It reminds me that it's not so bad It's not so bad <br>
</td></tr></table><br>

<table><tr><td>
I drank too much last night  Got bills to pay My head just feels in pain <br>
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today I'm late for work again <br>
</td></tr></table><br>

<table><tr><td>
And even if I'm there they'll all imply That I might not last the day <br>
And then you called me And it's not so bad It's not so bad <br>
</td></tr></table><br>

Push the door I'm home at last And I'm soaking through and through <br>
And then you handed me a towel And all I see is you <br>
And even if my house falls down now I wouldn't have a clue <br>
Because you're near me <br>
