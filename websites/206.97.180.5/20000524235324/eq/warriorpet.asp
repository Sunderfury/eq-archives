<h1>Warrior Modification Petition -- by <a href="mailto:trent@hbu.edu">Kindrael</a></h1>
<p>After much heated debate on the Forums I am proposing a solution to make the warrior become king of melee combat.
<ol>
	<li>Remove the Cap on Combat Skills (offense, defense, 1H slash, kick, dual wield, parry, etc.) which comes into effect around level 40.
	<li>Allow Warriors to advance 6 points in Combat Skills per level instead of just 5.  At level 10 a Warrior would melee as well as a level 12 Shadowknight.  At level 40 a Warrior would melee as well as a Level 48 Shadowknight.
        <li>A unique skill that no other class has.  Many players are in favor of Weapon Specialization (reduced delay and increased damage).  Use the same rules as specialization for Spell Casters.
</ol>

<p>This would mean that at beginning levels warriors show small improvement at melee over the hybrids, but by the time they hit the teens and the hybrids are getting their spells the warriors are starting to out-melee them. They would be hitting much more often and they would be much harder to hit.
