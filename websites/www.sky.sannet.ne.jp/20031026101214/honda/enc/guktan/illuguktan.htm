        <br>
        <b>You say, 'Hail, Master Scribe Uklo'</b><br>
        Master Scribe Uklo says 'Well met Jackys! Welcome to Gukta, the Outpost 
        of Marr -- our new home and base of operations for our fight to remove 
        the trolls from the rest of our beautiful swamp. The liberation of Gukta 
        was quite a battle! Many brave Froglok warriors, a good dose of [powerful 
        magic] and the blessings of Mithaniel Marr allowed us to cleanse this 
        place of the vile Trolls.' <br>
        <br>
        <b>You say, 'what powerful magic'</b><br>
        Master Scribe Uklo says 'Our battle wizards called many comets of ice 
        from the sky, along with bolts of pure magical force, brutal walls of 
        flame and even [illusions] to confuse and disorient the stupid trolls.'<br>
        <br>
        <b>You say, 'what illusions'</b><br>
        Master Scribe Uklo says 'A select few of Mithaniel's chosen know the secrets 
        of spinning illusions. This skill allowed our bravest warriors to infiltrate 
        the Troll's defenses and ensure victory. These are some of our most closely 
        guarded secrets. We only [teach] them to a select few so they can better 
        aid us in our battle.'<br>
        <br>
        <b>You say, 'what teach'</b><br>
        Master Scribe Uklo says 'You must first [prove] yourself a friend of Gukta 
        before I will teach you our secrets.'<br>
        <br>
        <b>You say, 'what prove'</b><br>
        Master Scribe Uklo says 'Very well, I will put your loyalty to the test. 
        Long ago, a great hero of our people lost his life fighting the Trolls. 
        He was in Rathe Mountains investigating a rumor that the Trolls were stockpiling 
        special weapons in an effort to turn the tide of war back in their favor. 
        He was ambushed by a group of troll marauders and their captain Krignok. 
        He fought valiantly, slaying the marauders and eventually locking swords 
        with the captain. But in the end, exhaustion got the better of him and 
        he died by the troll's hand. The Krignok respected the froglok's ferocity 
        and swore that they would one day finish their fight. So through a dark 
        ritual the troll Captain locked the froglok's spirit in his own sword 
        and broke it into 3 pieces. One piece he placed on the [battlefield] where 
        they fought. The other piece he gave to an [infamous troll] warrior to 
        guard. The location of the third piece has been lost over the time but 
        there are [clues] as to where it may be.'<br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="2"><b>You say, 'what clues'</b><br>
        Master Scribe Uklo says 'The troll captain spent some time in the lower 
        part of Guk. Apparently he was trying to control the undead frogs there 
        and use them against us. His plans did not see fruition and while trying 
        to escape he dropped the sword blade. It is rumored that another explorer 
        found it and the power drove him insane doomed to wander the halls of 
        Lower Guk seeking only to destroy others. I believe you will find this 
        to be the toughest piece to retrieve.'</font></p>

        powder together. You should be able to find the bile in the mountains 
        of fire and the drake lava powder is best retrieved from fire drakes in 
        the mountains of lava. Bring me the result and I should be able to restore
