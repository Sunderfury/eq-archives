&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting the loss of fantasy, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pushing myself into sleep.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wishing the sun would never rise,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It comes and I begin to weep.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dancing through the dreams,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Defending the fading tatters.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each representing happiness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Trying to find the one that matters.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Crystalline like a shattered mirror,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each shard darkening to coal.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Flying away upon the wind,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As the sun begins piecing my soul.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The warm light envelops me,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And away the illusion sold.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Disintegrating into dust,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like a vampire of old.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I catch a momentary glimpse,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the corner of my eye.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One aura covered fragment,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As it quickly passes by.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tearing me across half the world,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reality begins ripping me apart.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I stand with only a memory,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the sure beating of my heart.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Looking hard I see a golden cord,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Love connecting across the miles.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bringing to me, the smell of her hair,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the angelic brilliance of her smiles.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Remembering the brush of her lips,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I cry out for the beauty of her name.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can still feel her touch upon me,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Realizing nothing will be the same.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For I know in the future,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the very mists of memory.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That all will coalesce,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bringing her back to me.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
