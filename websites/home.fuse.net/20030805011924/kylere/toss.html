&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The coin is spinning, the dice are thrown,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fate is unaswered, the fears are grown.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While haunted for a day is she,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Standing haunted for years is he.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Called for advice is the wise woman of the clan,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her words simple, Place thy chip on the board young man.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For life is a gamble, with none to know the result,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The choice is your own, if you are to be an adult.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The decision was weighed, a small deception against the truth,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The plunge was made, cold waters shaking the memories of youth.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
