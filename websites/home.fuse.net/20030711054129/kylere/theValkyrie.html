&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Encased in steel I stand, guarding the walls of my soul,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a knight in dulled armour, emptiness is my only goal.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wear a flaming sword, created in the forges of pain,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
enpowered by the memories, I will never face again.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Standing on the tower, built of flawless steel,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveying my twisted realm, wondering what is real.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Am I or am I merely a spector, like the ghastly figures of light,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the plains around me, locked in my eternal work of night.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I feel something close to pity, for the denizens of my land,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
for each of them were created, by the sword in my hand.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some for their love, some for their hare,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
some for the emotion, I've been feeling of late.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Doesn't matter how strong you are, loneliness, the stuff of screams<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can take your world over, and destroy all your dreams.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is how I stood, living a horrid lie,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
designed by myself, waiting only to die. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then I found her, a flash in the corner of my eye,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the first true light, in my worlds darkened sky.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I smiled and turned to destroy, this new challenger of fate,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who was saying that I could love, when I could only hate.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She fought like a Valkyrie, then I saw her eyes,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
seeing the depth of her hope, I began to fantasize.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A world of laughter and light, where pain is not the king,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sorrow is replaced by joy, and we can do anything.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Distracted by her beauty, weakened by her charms,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I let her draw first blood, then staggered into her arms.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shocked by the innocence and passion that I found,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I realized that she was where, my future was bound. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
