&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I heard a scream from far above,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and turned to size the tower's height.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She stood on high, a wicked dream,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
her lust engaged in sating night.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What fate had kept her there for me,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
had only I the eyes to see.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her elvin form, her spectral streams,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Oh, what were she and I to be?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There visions drew me forth,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
was she a love from lives before?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Down at my feet, an iron key,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and in my path a sterling door.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Into the tower my will was bound,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in darkness was the spiral found.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ascending those stone steps in fear,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that I had forever lost the ground.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I cringed in care of my destiny,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
but could not break my hastened pace.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My soul sobbed mute, my breath in wait,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
impaled by the ghostly vision of her face.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Would I climb for eternity,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
amid these million blocks of stone?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was she alongside healing me,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or was this pain felt all alone?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The heights grew near, I heard her voice,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mine eyes sought for her desperately.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Found nought but moonglow filtered down,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from where she stood in wait for me.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
