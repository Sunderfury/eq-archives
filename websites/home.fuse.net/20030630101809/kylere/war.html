&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In a world of strife and misery,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
we so often forget our history.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
War is never the path we seek to run,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
but flowers can never replace the gun.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For if we were to remove all weapons in a day,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
some would still use their bare hands to slay.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A soldier's path is one of the truest loves,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ready to die defending both hawks and doves.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For love of country, and respect of their fellow man,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dying in pain, dying with love, for their nation's plan.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I once was a soldier, and I stood tall when asked,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I accomplished my mission, did what I was tasked.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now a new generation is given similiar goals,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
they do it without regard to the opinion polls.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For they understand that is what being a soldier means,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from grizzled old Sergeants to Privates in their teens.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can question their mission, question the right,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
but never fail to support them in any given fight.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fellow citizens of mine always jump to voice their discontent,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
not thinking freedom to disagree came from lives already spent.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I salute these young lads, the newest to leave their mothers,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For they have joined the few, the happy few, the band of brothers.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shakespeare knew it to be true as he set down his pen,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that none should ever express disrespect for these men.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The debates are over and the decision made,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
now is the time for the price to be paid.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Warriors have challenged our land with their rapacious way,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our soldiers go to instruct them in the price they must pay.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
