&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I once stood straight slowly shedding soft silent tears of pride,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
now that emotion is frail next to dreams of you being my bride.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once felt bright laughter and thought it was easing my pain,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
next to the happiness and comfort of you, it was legerdemain.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once lay silently on my back observing the night time stars,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
that sensation of wonder is weakened by the love that is ours.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once experienced glory and honor fighting for my nation,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
but that bright lit glory pales next to that of your creation.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once spent hours lost in the natural beauty of the sea,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
that feeling is for naught next to the way you look at me.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once thought I was warm laying on a pure white sands,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
but I know true warmth lies only in holding your hands.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once gazed amused in morning misty mountains far,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
they unlike my love for you will soon weather and mar.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once felt friendship reaching out to sooth my life,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
but now your companionship eases all my strife.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once beheld a forest shining glass ice clad,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
To compare it to you I would be called mad.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once noticed a flower full of wild intricacy,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
was but a toy compared to your delicacy.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once let a snowflake melt on my hand,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
next to your skin it felt rough like sand.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once drank a glass of perfect wine,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
next to your kiss it merely was fine.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once decided I knew of true care,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
next to yours was but dark despair.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once called out in happiness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
now I know it was emptiness.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once found morning light,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
now the sun seems slight.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once loved being alone.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
now I must simply atone.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once near perished,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
now I am cherished.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I once...<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
