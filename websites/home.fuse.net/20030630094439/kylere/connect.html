&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can you hear me, for I am the scream behind this screen.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Searching for reality, lost amongst the dream.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I seek you, in a world of others, found through lines of force,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A normal relationship, running a virtual course.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Routed to your perfection, switched to your soul.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Internetworked to your fantasy, connection my only goal.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yes, I can hear you, a voice from distant past-<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Running through my memory, catching up at last.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The seeker and the sought after overcome futility,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Connect to send and recieve, to make the dream reality.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though time detained the signal, and we've paid the painful cost,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It has met it's destination, and now never shall be lost.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They who hesitate are lost, and we have been found,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Connected by fate, like electricity seeking the ground.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our running is near over except for side by side,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We skip into perfection, outrun pain stride by stride.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We ran a marathon while thinking life was just a foot race,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All those past aches will ease as we fold into an embrace.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
