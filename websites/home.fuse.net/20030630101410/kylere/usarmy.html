&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
US Army, stationed overseas,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
my only home, my memories.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Looking back I, try to forget,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
what we had been, we ever met.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Problem is, remembering is charm,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
story is, reliving its harm.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My life has dealt many, cards of grief,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From which I can't seem to, find relief.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How do you cope, when your dreams become steel,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
how do you live, when apathy is real.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Uncomfortably numb, lost emotion,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
improbably empty, no tears begin.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everything seems so, illusionary,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Undeniably my world fades away.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MLR 1989
