<TR><TD WIDTH="15%">5 June 2003</TD><TD>According to the County Clerk's webpage the certified letter with the complaint for divorce was signed for on the 28th of May, over a week now with no response. I have to wonder how long it will take, got a call into my lawyer to discover if there is a time limit, but as of now have no idea. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3 June 2003</TD><TD>Well it has been quiet here, I guess I need to update. I let a week or 3 pass by with no more word from STBE or her lawyer, other than her sneaking into the house one weekend while I was out of town and going through my things. She has searched my mail a few times also, but I get 90% of it still so I am happy. Door lock broke so I replaced them, and since then I do not think she has entered the house, according to my new lawyer ( My god he is expensive but seems to be VERY capable) she cannot enter again or it will be an illegal entry. I have filed for a divorce and she has received the petition for divorce but has yet to make a response. I have actually gotten a few emails as a result of this site, and want to thank those who sent kind words of support, it means a lot when I am sleeping in an empty house, and trying to manage all the costs of it alone, while also trying to get by from day to day. My new and current lawyer tells me I should not worry that much because the courts are rather fair, and as such I refuse to do so anymore. Now I just play the waiting game until she files her response and we get a court date.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>30 Mar 2003</TD><TD>STBE's lawyer told me to suck it up ( in essense not in particular) and that he is advising full divorce with spousal support to her now. Such is the way the cookie crumbles. If they could have told me the amounts of debt they were asking me to assume, I would have just signed the original, but assuming unknown debt in the 8 to 20k range would be idiotic.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>6 Apr 2003</TD><TD>STBE failed to contact our agreed up rep of my interests and instead stripped the house of everything that she could, even taking mirrors off the wall that were there when we moved in. Walked off with the washer and dryer ( mine BTW, never hers) took every lamp in the place, including the ONE I used of the 50. Stripped silly stuff out of the place. Tracked dog feces on the carpet and did not clean it, and left the water running from where the washer was disconnected, and even took some of my clothes that were in the washer. I replied to her lawyer about the separation agreement asking for a slightly more reasonable rewrite and he in a rather rude manner, told me he would just sue for divorce and ask for unreasonable support terms.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>4 Apr 2003</TD><TD>Got a separation agreement, hmm half of condo sale money to each of us and I get all unnamed, unspecified debts on cards with limits of nearly 20k that were once around 8k balance. Have a bad feeling they are maxxed, asked for amounts to be specified</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3 Apr 2003</TD><TD>STBE contacted me with times to pick up her stuff from the condo on Sunday, I advised her it was having an open house, and would be unavailable for some of that time.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2 Apr 2003</TD><TD>No contact from STBE or her lawyer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1 Apr 2003</TD><TD>No contact from STBE or her lawyer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>31 Mar 2003</TD><TD>Emailed STBE's lawyer, let him know I will just begin a one sided divorce process on Friday the 4th if I do not have anything from them, and to let them know I will be putting her stuff into a storage unit. Really tired of the games. Why is it that when 2 people are unhappy being married, all it takes is one of them stepping up and saying it for the other to turn from unhappiness to pure hatred and abuse. I guess of course that without that type of nature being present a marriage would work out. In the last 3 months I have been presented with things in my life that make me very likely to believe in God, and on the other side, I have seen that being Christian does not make you a good, a nice, or even a considerate human being. I think everyone would have a church and attend regularly based on the word of God, but the actions of his followers make it a challenge.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>30 Mar 2003</TD><TD>No contact from STBE or her lawyer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>29 Mar 2003</TD><TD>No contact from STBE or her lawyer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>28 Mar 2003</TD><TD>STBE showed up 2 hours late last night, since apparently she was unable to get a truck, I guess Uhaul, Budget, Penske, and Ryder all went out of business. She got about 40% of her boxes, took all the plants, and no furniture, so I am still burdened by them while trying to make improvements to the house to improve its selling chances. I think next week I will rent a storage unit, move all her stuff to it, then mail her lawyer the key and change the locks on the house. I am sure this was just another way of harassing me. It is funny because she is playing the poor scorned woman role, but all the hassle, harrassment and annoyance causing in this has been from her to me. Still no separation agreement. I may have to just go ahead with sueing for a divorce, looking at the list of divorce grounds in Ohio;

<UL>
<LI>
Bigamy. 
<LI>
Willful absence of either party for one year. 
<LI>
Adultery. 
<LI>
Extreme Cruelty. 
<LI>
Fraudulent Contract. 
<LI>
Gross Neglect of duty. 
<LI>
Habitual drunkenness. 
<LI>
Imprisonment of adverse party at the time of filing for divorce. 
</UL>
I guess I could start drinking, or sleeping around. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>27 Mar 2003</TD><TD>Been waiting on a list of things STBE wants to take since Monday, even though I sent her a list she has yet to respond and is supposed to be there this evening to get things, I hope she likes the division I have done, because it is not going to change now.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>25 Mar 2003</TD><TD>Spoke with STBE yesterday, still waiting on a separation agreement, but will give it to Friday now. Worked out some details for getting our personal items from each other and splitting furniture. Will be glad when it is done, as I will be able to get more done in an empty condo to sell it than I am in one half full of furniture.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>21 Mar 2003</TD><TD>Divorce is hell, but I exist, and I am much happier alone than in a facade.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>20 Mar 2003</TD><TD>No agreement in mail, sigh will give it an extra 3 days then talk to my lawyer on Monday to start normal divorce rather than dissolution proceedings, these delays like the many other hassassment methods are just ways to ensure that she makes my existance the living hell she had told me repeatedly she would inflict if I ever seriously tried to divorce her. She was decidedly not joking about doing so. But I am in good spirits regardless, nothing bad can last forever</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>19 Mar 2003</TD><TD>Heh turns out STBE cancelled all utilities, spent day fixing</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>18 Mar 2003</TD><TD>DSL Line went out on me, turns out STBE cancelled it, fun fun</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>13 Mar 2003</TD><TD>STBE's Lawyer called me and said he was unaware he was supposed to be doing an agreement, rather interesting to me, since she had told me otherwise, he informed me I would have it by the 20th of March</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>13 Mar 2003</TD><TD>I send an email to STBE letting her know I am filing for the more expensive and time consuming standard divorce on the 21st if I have not heard otherwise from her or her attorney</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>12 Mar 2003</TD><TD>I await the separation agreement</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>04 Mar 2003</TD><TD>Since I am still amicable, I let STBE in house today to get her things, she stripped all cash from the place including over 1000 in coins, I guess this is part of the effort to ensure I do not have cash to fix up my house for sale. Since she has both our tax returns I am tight on cash</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>03 Mar 2003</TD><TD>STBE informed me she is living elsewhere and her lawyer will contact me, I ask when I can expect a separation agreement, she dithers on the answer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>02 Mar 2003</TD><TD>No word from STBE (soon to be ex)</TD></TR>
