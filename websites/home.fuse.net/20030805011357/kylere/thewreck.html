&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Used to love this car, the freedom it gave me was boundless, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
flying down the road from dusk to the far bright dawn. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
instant response to handling, rapid speed, all fears groundless. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Top down, wind in my hair, forever onward drawn. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sun beating down on my face, warmth on my chest, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
flowing smoothly down glass-like blacktopped roads. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Purring up every hill, rapidly reaching every crest, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
one little press of pedal and the power explodes. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gazing upwards to see those pedals overhead, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pulling the cushions ripped from the backseat tight. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The chill has set in, encouraging my dread, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
broken leg throbbing, each movement a new bite. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I shift around to remove a sharp pain in my thigh, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
another one of thousands of small squares of glass,  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
crouched in dark, wishing I could once more see sky, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with each moment my hopes begin to pass. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Falling asleep again, thinking of what has occured, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
travelling to my love, and crushed by one deer. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Trapped inside my own car, caught in the absurd, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
spinning, flipping and turned lost in my fear. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still feel the final bone crushing impact, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the total silence setting in from tearing steel. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Doors trapped in sports car become compact, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
beneath me lies only rock as far as I can feel. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I remember when I still saw light in the cracks, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
before the belated snow decided to fall. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pain blinds me when I do anything but relax, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
phone must have flown out, no saving call. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another sleep and the cold has become devil, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the loss of feeling spreads, my nipples are cursing. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then they are quieted and my nerves start to revel, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
losing inches of feeling, like my growth is reversing. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My lips must be blue, I wish the broken leg would fade, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
crushed by the dash as the roof gave away. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But no cold strikes there as if fearing to invade, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the warmth of pain it cannot seem to betray. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Must have slept again I can longer feel my arms, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
swollen and feverish despite the unrelenting cold. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rescue no longer dreamed for, no screaming alarms, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
death is slipping in reaching out its clawing hold. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now I dream that there is still power to this little toy, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
so that my love knows I missed her with my last breath. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I loved you both as man, and once as a boy, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I loved you in life, now I love you in death.  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
