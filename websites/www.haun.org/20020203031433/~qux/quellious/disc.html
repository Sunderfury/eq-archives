  Melee Disciplines </h2>
<p>In addition to the many automatic skills and abilities that characters will 
  receive past 50th level, we've added player-controlled fighting &quot;disciplines&quot; 
  to the repertoires of the pure melee (warriors, monks, and rogues) and hybrid 
  (Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, and Bard) classes. These disciplines are activated 
  using the /discipline command on the command line, and have a duration and base 
  reuse time associated with them. You cannot use any other discipline until the 
  reuse time of the last-used discipline has expired. You can type /discipline 
  on the command line to view the disciplines available to you, as well as the 
  amount of time before you can use another one.</p>
<p>Some disciplines, particularly the ones with long duration, have a disadvantage 
  in addition to the advantage provided by the discipline. In all cases where 
  this happens, the disadvantage is less severe than the advantage. For instance, 
  where the Evasive Discipline allows a warrior to be hit by his opponent less 
  by a factor of 35%, the warrior will also hit his target less, but only by a 
  factor of 15%. In the interest of exploration, further formulae will not be 
  provided. </p>
