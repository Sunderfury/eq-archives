<b>/assist</b> [target] or &lt;character name&gt; -
<blockquote> 
  <p> /assist だけにすると現在ターゲットしている人がターゲットしている相手をターゲットします。 <br>
    名前を指定すると、指定した人がターゲットしている相手をターゲットします。<br>
    主にメインタンクを指定してターゲットすることが多いです。<br>
    このとき、eqclient.ini の AttackOnAssist を FALSE にしておくと assist 時に自動的に攻撃しなくなるので<br>
    間違ってターゲットしてしまった時の事故を防げます。 (寝かせたmobを起こしたりとか)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>/autosplit</b> [ON/OFF] -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>MasterLoot(パーティのうち一人が代表してルートして置くこと)を担当した人は /autosplit OFF にすると良いです。<br>
    拾う時に自動的にsplitするのではなく拾った人のみがcoinを拾います。<br>
    Monkがいる場合も礼儀として autosplit OFF にするほうが良いです。<br>
    彼らは物が少しでも重くなるとステータスが下がっていきますから…。 <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>/split </b># # # # -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>MasterLootした後等、最後にお金を分ける時とかに使います。<br>
    (Raidとかだと、拾った物すべてをRaidリーダーに渡すこともあるので場合に応じて使います。) <br>
    左から順に pp gp sp cp です。/split 4 4 2 0 とすると、全員に 4pp 4gp 2sp 0cpを人数で割った分が<br>
    配られます。</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>しばらく席を離れる時とかに使います。<br>
    /afk on にすると、名前の横に [AFK] とついて他の人から見てすぐにわかるようになります。<br>
    また、tell をしてきた相手には自動的に &lt;text&gt; で指定した文章を返答します。<br>

    出なくなります。/w all GUILD 等にもひっかかりません。</p>

<p><b>/roleplay</b> [ON/OFF] -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>roleplay状態にします。<br>
    キャラクタの頭の上の名前にはギルド名が付きます。/who で見たときにはクラス・レベルが出なくなります。<br>
    こちらの状態だと/w all GUILD や、/w all &lt;ギルド名&gt; でも探すことができます。<br>

<p><b>/targetgroupbuff</b> [ON/OFF] -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>11/7 のパッチで導入された新機能。<br>
    グループ魔法(Pack sow,Pack rege,Group Cla etc...)は、通常時は自分のいるグループにかかるものですが、<br>
    ON にしておくことにより、ターゲットした人がいるグループにかかるようになります。<br>
    複数パーティ行動時はかなり重宝すると思います。 </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>/serverfilter</b> [ON/OFF]</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>各種Planeや、複数パーティが前提の場所で戦うとPCの数が非常に多く、文字情報だけでもラグの原因に<br>
    なることがあります。そんなときには ON にするとサーバーから送られる時点でデータがカットされるので<br>
    ラグを解消できる事があります。<b>(Raid時 ON 推奨)</b><br>
    <br>
    (技術的な予想：おそらくOther Hits OFF という設定にしていても、serverfilterがOFFの場合は<br>
    Other Hits もサーバー側から送られてきて、クライアント側で表示しないようにしていると思います。<br>
    これが、serverfilter ON だとサーバー側でカットするのでクライアントに送られるパケット量が減り、<br>
    結果、ラグ軽減に繋がるものだと思われます。) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>/showspelleffects</b> [ON/OFF]</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>魔法の画面効果を描画しなくします。<br>
    画像系の画面描画に負担がかかるのもラグの原因につながるので、重いなあと感じたらOFFにすると<br>
    良いかもしれません。非常に画面はシンプルになりますが。<b>(Raid時 OFF 推奨)</b></p>

<hr>
<h2>APPENDIX A - Various Commands and Emotes </h2>
<p>Below is a list of more command /command available within game. You can get 
  a complete list of all /commands available to you in game by typing /help [type] 
  where &quot;type&quot; is &quot;guild&quot;, &quot;emotes&quot;, or &quot;normal&quot;. 
  Type /help alone to return usage instructions.</p>
<p>When you see [ ] below, the text within those brackets are parameters for the 
  command being described. They are the options that you can choose when using 
  that command. They will be separated by commas when there is more than one. 
  Typing the command and then parameter (without the brackets) will give you the 
  result described. If you see [ON/OFF] then the command is a toggle. That means 
  that you do not need to type on or off, just typing the command will change 
  the state of the toggle. So if you are currently Anonymous and you type /anon, 
  the command will toggle the state of your anonymous flag to OFF (since it was 
  ON before).</p>
<p>[target] indicates that you must have a character targeted for the command 
  to work.</p>
<p>Also, where you see &lt; &gt;, the information within the brackets is not a 
  specific parameter, but is a kind of text that you will need to type. For example 
  if you see &lt;character name&gt;, then you will need to type in a character 
  name as the parameter for the command, without the brackets. If it just says 
  &lt;text&gt;, then the nature of the text is up to you to determine (though 
  the brackets are not needed).</p>
<p><br>
  <b>/anon</b> or <b>/a</b> [ON/OFF] - Makes you Anonymous in /who and /who all, 
  preventing other players from seeing your class, level, and current location.</p>
<p><b>/afk</b> [ON/OFF] &lt;text&gt; - When activated, all private tells sent 
  to the user will auto-respond with the following text, &quot;You told &lt;players 
  name&gt;, 'Sorry, I am A.F.K. (Away from keyboard) right now.'&quot;. If you 
  add &lt;text&gt; then that text will replace the default AFK message.</p>
<p><b>/assist</b> [target] or &lt;character name&gt; - if you target a character 
  that is within 200', the /assist command will automatically target for you whoever 
  that character has targeted at the moment- this can be very useful in heavy 
  combat. To be most effective, it is best to set this as a Social (see IV.F above)</p>
<p><b>/assist</b> [ON/OFF] - Toggles the autoattack function associated with the 
  /assist function. The default of ON turns on your autoattack when you use /assist. 
  If you type /assist off then autoattack will not start when you use /assist. 
  This is one case where you must use the parameters on and off for this to work.</p>
<p><b>/attack</b> [ON/OFF] - Toggles in and out of attack mode. This will put 
  you in attack mode even if nothing is targeted. Be careful not to use this when 
  near NPC's that you have targeted. By default, this is set to the &quot;a&quot; 
  key. Care should also be taken when you are near an NPC that you have targeted 
  not to hit the &quot;a&quot; key, as this may cause you to attack the NPC.</p>
<p><b>/auction</b> &lt;text&gt; - Allows users to send auction messages throughout 
  the current zone. Please use this channel only for auctions.</p>
<p><b>/autosplit</b> [ON/OFF] - automatically splits any loot you get with the 
  rest of your party. Each member must do this to split all loot.</p>
<p><b>/book</b> [1-50] - Opens your spell book to the specified page.</p>
<p><b>/bug</b> or <b>/b</b> - takes you to a bug-reporting screen</p>
<p><b>/camp</b> [desktop/server] - Allows the player to exit to the server select 
  screen or desktop depending on what is specified. You can use just /camp by 
  itself as well. You must be sitting in order for this command to work. If attacked 
  while camping out, the /camp command will be cancelled, thus preventing exit 
  from the game.</p>
<p><b>/cast</b> [1-8] - causes your character to cast the spell in the specified 
  memorization slot.</p>
<p><b>/channel</b> [gsay/ooc/shout/guild/auction] - toggles the chat channels 
  on or off.</p>
<p><b>/chatfontsize</b> [0-5] - This is for Velious subscribers only. It is used 
  in full screen mode only to change the chat font size.</p>
<p><b>/consent</b> &lt;character name&gt; - gives the character permission to 
  drag your corpse</p>
<p><b>/consider</b> or <b>/con</b> - gives vital statistics of a targeted PC or 
  NPC</p>
<p><b>/corpse</b> [target] - will summon the target's corpse if it is within a 
  50' radius of the character. You can either target the character or the character's 
  corpse. This will only work if the targeted character has used the /consent 
  command on the character trying to use the /corpse command. If no target is 
  selected when the /corpse command is used, it will summon your own character's 
  corpse if it is within 50' of the character.</p>
<p><b>/decline</b> - Declines a duel.</p>
<p><b>/disband</b> [target] - Allows a character to disband from a group if he/she 
  has themselves targeted. This command also allows the group leader to disband 
  a targeted member of the group if they are in the same zone.</p>
<p><b>/doability </b>[1-6|7-10] - 1-6 performs the associated ability from the 
  &quot;abilities&quot; page, 7-10 perform the associated combat skill.</p>
<p><b>/duel</b> or <b>/d </b>- challenges targeted PC to a duel - to accept, they 
  have to type /d with you targeted as well. Duel is in effect until one combatant 
  &quot;dies&quot; (is knocked unconscious) or flees the zone. Until the duel 
  is resolved, the two combatants can't be affected by spells from PCs not in 
  the duel, nor can they cast spells on those outside the duel.</p>
<p><b>/dynamiclights</b> [ON/OFF] - When on, this command enables players to see 
  specially rendered lighting. This command is most useful when the player is 
  holding, or has a light source with them, such as a torch. Turn this command 
  to off if you notice low frame rate. </p>
<p><b>/em</b> &lt;text&gt; or <b>:</b> &lt;text&gt; - emotes the text. Some emotes 
  have animations associated with them, most do not. Predefined emotes are listed 
  below.</p>
<p><b>/exit</b> - This command is the same as /quit and should not be used by 
  players unless to escape from a death bind loop.</p>
<p><b>/fastdrop</b> [ON/OFF/NEVER] - Disables or enables the ability to drop items 
  on the ground without a confirmation box. The recommended setting for this option 
  is the same as the default setting, which is /fastdrop off. If set to never, 
  you will never be able to drop any items on the ground. If set to on, no confirmation 
  box will come up before dropping the item on the ground. Caution is advised 
  as many NPC's (Non player characters such as merchants) do pick up items dropped 
  on the ground by players.</p>
<p><b>/feedback</b> - takes you to the feedback/comments screen.</p>
<p><b>/filter</b> [ON/OFF]- Toggles the profanity filter on and off.</p>
<p><b>/follow</b> [target] - When this command is used while targeting another 
  player, the user will automatically follow the targeted character.</p>
<p><b>/friend</b> &lt;character name&gt; - adds or removes a 'friend' from your 
  friends list. /friend &lt;character name&gt; will add the player to your list, 
  and /friend &lt;character name&gt; again, for the same character, will remove 
  him/her. /friend by itself will list the players in your friends list. A /who 
  friend will let you know if anyone on your friends list is in the zone you are 
  in, and a /who all friend will let you know if anyone on your friends list is 
  on the server you are on. Your friends list can only contain 30 names per character. 
  And be aware that in order to remove someone from the list, you must type their 
  name precisely.</p>
<p><b>/gems</b> - This command allows a player to play the game Gems.</p>
<p><b>/gsay</b> &lt;text&gt; or <b>/g</b> &lt;text&gt; - text is seen by all in 
  your group</p>
<p><br>
  <i><b>Guild Commands:</b></i></p>
<p><b>/guildsay</b> &lt;text&gt; or<b> /gu</b> &lt;text&gt; - Sends a text message 
  to all fellow guild members currently on-line.</p>
<p><b>/guildinvite</b> [target] - Guild Leaders and Officers may use this command 
  to invite new guild members. In order to make an officer, the guild leader must 
  use the following command: /guildinvite o &lt;playername&gt;. You can also just 
  have the player targetted and type /guildinvite o. You must be in the same zone 
  as the player you want to invite into the guild. The letter o must be lower 
  cased. If the player you want to make an officer is currently in the guild, 
  they will have to /guildremove themselves (with themselves targetted) , in order 
  to be made an officer through this command.</p>
<p><b>/guildremove</b> [target] - Guild Leaders and Officers may use this command 
  to remove guild members. Keep in mind that if you target yourself when executing 
  this command, you will remove yourself from the guild.</p>
<p><b>/guilddelete</b> - Guild Leaders may use this command to disband a their 
  guild.</p>
<p><b>/guildstatus</b> [target] or &lt;character name&gt; - Will return the guild 
  status of the targeted or named character (their rank within their guild, if 
  any). This command will only work on characters within the same zone.</p>
<p><b>/guildleader</b> [target] - Transfers guild leadership status to the targeted 
  guild officer..</p>
<p><b>/guildwar</b> &lt;guild leader name&gt; &lt;number&gt; - Allows the guild 
  leader to challenge or accept another guild in guild war. Both parameters are 
  necessary, and both guild leaders must execute the command. The number is the 
  number of days that the guild war will last, from 1 to 14. All members of a 
  guild at war with another guild are PvP with each other for the duration of 
  the guild war.</p>
<p><b>/guildpeace</b> &lt;guild leader name&gt;- Allows the guild leader to end 
  a guild war. Both guild leaders must execute this command to end the war. Guild 
  war will end in any case after the time limit has passed.</p>
<p><b>/guildmotd</b> &lt;text&gt; - Officers of a guilds can specify the text 
  to show up after the regular server MOTD (Message of the Day) for each of their 
  guild members when they log in. The guild message of the day will always be 
  preceded by the name of the guild officer that set it up. There is a maximum 
  of around 200 characters for this guild motd. Any new guild message of the day 
  overwrites the last guild message of the day. When a server goes down, all guild 
  messages of the day will be deleted and will need to be reset. There is no other 
  way to delete a guild message of the day.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>/help</b> [emote/guild/normal] - Shows the player all of the commands available 
  in area specified.</p>
<p><b>/hidecorpses</b> [all/none/allbutgroup] - This command allows the player 
  to choose to not see other player's corpses in-game. This allows for less lag 
  in situations where there are many corpses around. Keep in mind that the all 
  and the allbutgroup options will hide NPC corpses. Your own corpse is never 
  hidden. The default is none.</p>
<p><b>/ignore</b> &lt;player name&gt; - Will block all text from that character.</p>
<p><b>/inspect</b> [ON/OFF] - Toggles on and off your ability to inspect others 
  with a right-click of the mouse. Use this toggle if you use the mouse for movement 
  and find yourself accidentally inspecting others.</p>
<p><b>/invite</b> [target] - Invites targeted player into a group. This command 
  can only be executed by the group leader.</p>
<p><b>/invwinlabels</b> - For Velious subscribers only. This command toggles on 
  and off the descriptions for the full screen mode inventory.</p>
<p><b>/language</b> - Returns the number of the language that you are currently 
  speaking. /language [help] returns a list of languages and their identification 
  number. /language [#] sets the current language.</p>

  in the /who and &quot;/who all&quot; lists.</p>
<p><b>/log </b>[ON/OFF]- Logs all text locally to the user痴 machine. The file 
  that is generated can be found in your EverQuest directory. The format of the 
  filename is eqlog_(server #)_(character name).txt.</p>
<p><b>/location</b> or <b>/loc</b> - Displays the character痴 current location 
  coordinates within the zone. The location will show as x, y, z.</p>
<p><b>/loot</b> - Allows the character to loot a corpse from a short distance. 
  The corpse must be targeted when performing this command. You can achieve the 
  same result by right clicking on a corpse.</p>
<p><b>/lootnodrop</b> [ALWAYS/SOMETIMES/NEVER] - This command is used to specify 
  how you loot no drop items on corpses. Always is default and will cause a prompt 
  box to always be shown when looting no drop items. Set to sometimes so only 
  items not usable by your character will show a prompt box. When you have this 
  set to never, you will never get a confirmation box to see if you want to loot 
  or not. </p>
<p><b>/mcicontrol </b>- Allows a player to control sound devices such as cdaudio 
  or mp3s to play when in-game. This command will be further developed in the 
  future to be more user friendly. Until that point, the following are some commands 
  you can use to play audio CD's:<br>
  Before using any other of these commands, use the following to open up communications:<br>
  /mcicontrol open cdaudio <br>
  To play:<br>
  /mcicontrol play cdaudio <br>
  To pause:<br>
  /mcicontrol pause cdaudio <br>
  To stop:<br>
  /mcicontrol stop cdaudio <br>
  To skip forward:<br>
  /mcicontrol step cdaudio <br>
  To skip back:<br>
  /mcicontrol back cdaudio <br>
  To eject the CD:<br>
  /mcicontrol eject cdaudio <br>
  Note: Though ejecting itself should not cause any gameplay problems, putting 
  in a new disk may. <br>
  If you have AutoPlay enabled on your computer (which is windows default), it 
  may start your CDaudio program and possibly, switch out of EverQuest, causing 
  EverQuest to likely crash, or at the least may cause a phantom cursor to appear. 
  <br>
  If you have AutoPlay disabled, putting in a disk should not cause any problems.</p>
<p><b>/mousespeed</b> [0-3] - Changes the mouse travel speed across the monitor. 
  3 is the maximum setting (the higher the number the faster the mouse moves). 
  Don't set this above 3. Your mouse will move too quickly and you will probably 
  not be able to play.</p>
<p><b>/msg</b> - This is the same as using /Tell.</p>
<p><b>/note</b> &lt;text&gt; - Allows the player to write notes when in-game to 
  be referenced later out of game. This creates a notes.txt file of the text. 
  Each line of text sent using /note is appended to the end of this file. There 
  is a maximum number of 455 characters when creating a note.</p>
<p><b>/ooc</b> &lt;text&gt; - allows you to say something as yourself, not as 
  your character, heard throughout the zone. Please only use this channel for 
  out of character speech, and please try to limit your out of character speech 
  to this channel.</p>
<p><b>/pet</b> [command] - gives orders to a charmed or summoned pet. Sample pet 
  commands:</p>
<p><b>/pet guard here</b> - tells the pet to guard its current location.</p>
<p><b>/pet guard me</b> - tells the pet to attack anyone that attacks it's master, 
  or that it's master attacks.</p>
<p><b>/pet follow me</b> - tells the pet to follow you, but ends when you cross 
  a zone line.</p>
<p><b>/pet attack</b> [target] - tells the pet to attack the designated target.</p>
<p><b>/pet back off </b>- tells the pet to stop its attack.</p>
<p><b>/pet as you were</b> - returns the pet to neutral, belaying all prior orders.</p>
<p><b>/pet get lost</b> - will send the pet back to where it came from.</p>
<p><b>/pet report health</b> - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.</p>
<p><b>/petition</b> &lt;text&gt; - Used to request assistance from a GM. The more 
  detailed &lt;text&gt; is, the quicker the assistance can be rendered. To prevent 
  'spamming' of the petition queue, each character can only send in one petition 
  (for as long as that petition is in the queue).</p>
<p><b>/played</b> - Returns the birth date and hours played for the current character.</p>
<p><b>/quit </b>- Immediately exits the game. However, when you exit in this manner, 
  your character has not 'camped out' in the proper fashion, and he or she will 
  remain in the game world for a short period after you have quit. Your character 
  will be under the control of the server, and may very well die while you are 
  not there to tell it what to do. So only use this command when you are in a 
  rush to leave the game or are in an in-game situation that you can't get out 
  of with the standard sit and camp method. The risk you take when using this 
  shortcut to exit the game is all yours.</p>
<p><b>/random</b> [x, x y] - /random x generates a random number between 0 and 
  x. /random x y will generate a random number between x and y. This can be used 
  to decide things randomly, for instance, who gets a recently acquired treasure.</p>
<p><b>/reply</b> &lt;text&gt; - If a &quot;/tell&quot; is received, the user may 
  respond by using this command. /reply will reply to the very last person to 
  send you a /tell.</p>
<p><b>/report</b> &lt;character name&gt; - Allows a player to report the text 
  that is currently being displayed in the chat window. If you are reporting harassment, 
  bad language, threats, or other actions by another player, use their character 
  name for the &lt;character name&gt; in the report. If you are reporting falling 
  for 10,000 points damage, or other irregularities that affect your character, 
  then use your character's name. You should then use /petition and let a GM know 
  that you have used /report so that they will know to look for your reported 
  text. To prevent 'spamming', you can only send one report at a time. You can 
  do another /report only after zoning. Please make sure to have the text you 
  want to report in the chat window when you use this command, /report will only 
  send the bottom ten lines of text that are actually shown in your chat window. 
  Use Shift-Page Up and Shift-Page Down to move through your chat text until you 
  see the text you want to report.</p>
<p><b>/resetwindows</b> - Used to reset to default the locations on-screen for 
  the different Graphical User Interface (GUI) boxes.</p>
<p><b>/reverb</b> [ON/OFF] - Toggles the reverb (echo) sounds on or off.</p>
<p><b>/reversesound</b> - This command will reverse the left and right channel 
  for your sound.</p>
<p><b>/roleplay</b> [ON/OFF] - Hides your race, class, and location while still 
  displaying your guild tag, and turns your name purple to indicate that you prefer 
  to remain &quot;in-character&quot;.</p>
<p><b>/serverfilter</b> [ON/OFF] - Allows player to turn off or on packet messages 
  from other players, allowing for less lag in raid situations.</p>
<p><b>/shout</b> &lt;text&gt; - Shouted text is seen across entire zone. Shout 
  is an 'in-character' channel, so please keep your speech in this channel in 
  character.</p>
<p><b>/shownames</b> [ON/OFF] - turns on or off visible names above PC's and NPC's 
  heads.</p>
<p><b>/showspelleffects</b> [ON/OFF] - Toggles spell effects (visuals) on or off.</p>
<p><b>/sit</b> [ON/OFF] - Causes your character to sit or stand.</p>
