It is now split by continent.  I also added three new sections in the EQ Strategies area... Plane of Air, Pet Control 101 and 102 and How to Group with Mages an Indepth Guide.  Read these at your leisure.  I highly recommend the "How to Group with Mages" for everyone.<br>Side Note:  In case you can't tell, I've actually reached a point on EQ that I'm a little bored with the game again and I'm burying myself in the website.  Expect some nice additions and changes over the next few weeks.<br>I'll also repeat this post for the last time.<br>It is that time of year again.  The bill has come for the website.  $200.00. I have taken in 123.55 in advertising revenue from Amazon.  If you would like to donate: Marty Cox 1435 10th St. Moline, Il 61265.  Don't worry about it if you don't want to.  Just enjoy the website!  Future plans include more strategies for Velious areas, mapping out of the Phinny pull to the zone(by popular request), and more.  I also accept submissions of screenshots, strategies, and suggestions of ways to better the website.</p></color></font>

In fact, so little hate was generated by these spells that it made<br>controlling NPC aggression trivial. Heal spells will now generate an amount<br>of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed. Due to<br>our desire to leave the lower level game more or less untouched, two<br>separate caps have been placed for targets level 50 or below, and 51 or<br>above. Heal spells will generate significantly less hate for targets below<br>level 51 than those at or above that level.<br><br></p></color></font>

I have been for over 2 years.  In the last year and a half (Since AT&T bought out TCI in my area) the service has steadly declined.  I recently did a test loading the main web page 4 times during prime time.  The test was my p3 500 with 128 meg of ram on cable vs my p3 450 with 64 meg of ram on a 56k modem connection to DCS computers.  Can you guess which won?  You got it... The regular modem connection won.  Now I haven't been able to get my email for 6 days and have already spent 2 hours on the phone with thier tech support and they haven't managed to fix it.  They have switched mail servers on me and don't know which one my account belongs on.  They did this without informing me of the change or any notification whatsoever.  This is the second time they have done this.<br><br>They have not asked me if I would like my account credited for the time lost or offer recompense in any form.  I filed a complaint with the Illinois States Attorney against them and they had the Gall to accuse me of running a personal website off my computer.  I pay a good chunk of money each year to DCS computers to host this website.  I feel that AT&T is commiting FALSE ADVERTISING in the way they advertise thier product and the service I am provided with is very very poor.  They have an extreme lack of communication between their customers and network engineers.  The Head of thier customer service division is a putz and I will be changing to DSL as soon as it becomes availiable.</p></color></font>
