Info taken from: <A HREF="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovequests.showMessage?topicID=4799.topic" TARGET=_blank>http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovequests.showMessage?topicID=4799.topic</A> <P>After reading the Rivervale or the Qeynos newspaper, go North Qeynos, over the gates of the city<P>You say, 'Hail, Vegalys Keldrane'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Greetings to you, citizen. By order of the Council of Qeynos I have been given the duty of apprehending the individuals [responsible] for unleashing this terrible plague upon the people and the lands of Antonius Bayle. The more I look into this matter, the more I come to find that this will be no easy task. <P>You say, 'what responsible ?'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'The plague unleashed upon the Plains of Karana is the work of the followers of Bertoxxulous. Those responsible belong to group known as the Bloodsabers though there were others involved as well. Some time back, they launched a plot to overthrow Antonius Bayle and our ruling council. Their [plan] failed. <P>You say, 'what plan ?'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Their plan was to unleash a plague so deadly and virulent that it would wipe out all life from here to Highpass Hold. They planned to brand themselves and their foul allies with a rune that would have rendered them immune to the effects of this plague. From that point they would have been able to simply walk in, easily defeat the weakened stragglers and declare themselves the rulers of this kingdom by default. But they were [careless]. <P>You say, 'how they were careless ?'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'The sudden influx of scoundrels and loathsome individuals was our first tip off. They required a rather enormous number of supplies, materials and manpower to construct the ornate altars, craft and enchant their runed branding irons and supply their armies with the weapons needed for the cleanup work afterward. They needed to rely upon [outside help]. <P>You say, 'what outside help ?'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'They mostly chose to hire bandits and brigands who are foolishly more concerned with immediate profits than the long-term effects of their actions. But once they knew we were on to them they even started hiring some of the more 'civil' gnolls, if there is such a thing. Gnolls tend to be easy to push around, stupid, and they work very cheaply. They knew their time was short and they were desperate. Choosing to work with untrustworthy, lazy scoundrels caused the whole thing to begin to [unravel], praise Rodcet! <P>You say, 'what about unravel ?'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Their workers were careless. Aside from noticing the unsavory element in our city, our citizens began to run across many of the strange items and materials that were being trafficked into our city en masse. It was at that point that the citizens began to [complain] quite loudly about all of this. <P>You say, 'what complain ?'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Obviously, they questioned the meaning behind these events and rightfully so. They were frightened much as they are now. I admit, I was remiss in my duties for not noticing it sooner. One of the biggest complainers during this time was a man by the name of [Earron Huntlan], proprieter of the famed Lion's Mane tavern. Though he is just a simple merchant, he did us a great service. <P>You say, 'who is Earron Huntlan ?'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Earron is quite a character. He gets all kinds of travelers stopping by his inn for a drink or whatever other business. His patrons started telling stories of being mugged and harassed by these loathsome individuals in the very streets of our fair city. Of course, he was concerned. So he became a kind of advocate for this cause, ringing the [alarm] bell as it were. I admit, at first I did not believe the conspiracy. I simply could not believe it was all happening under our nose. <P>You say, 'what alarm ?'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Well, he succeeded in whipping the populace into a frenzy. He even got the famous wizard Al'Kabor to help him out by determining the nature of the strange items many of our citizens were finding. Getting that man to do anything not directly related to his research is not an easy thing to accomplish either. Needless to say, at that point I saw the truth and the Prime Healer forgive me for not seeing it sooner. Were it not for the investigations and general outcry of [concerned citizens], we might not be standing here talking today. <P>You say, 'what concerned citizens ?'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Yes, it was citizens like you that helped to save Qeynos that day. We uncovered their plot, captured the man who was in charge and put him to death. Of course, the Bloodsabers retaliated and using their incomplete research still managed to unleash the plague we face now. Though devastating in its own right, you must admit it is rather mild compared to what it might have been. I thank you for your interest. Perhaps you would be willing to [help] me? <P>You say, 'I am willing to help you'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Excellent! The more I learn from my investigators the more I find that these Bloodsabers have stretched their tendrils of influence all throughout our beloved city. Nevertheless, we are committed to exposing these fiends once and for all. Perhaps you would like to become an [investigator]? <P>You say, 'I would like to cecome an investigator'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Very well then, Durix . We will not allow just anyone to wear the official Investigator's Badge and please forgive me. . . But it is hard to tell where one's loyalties lie these days. If you are truly [serious] then there is a duty you must perform first to show you are on the side of Antonius Bayle, the council and the good people Qeynos. <P>You say, 'I am truly serious'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'There is a guard by the name of Robbie Shilster that patrols the Northern Plains of Karana. He is allied with our enemies and completely corrupt. He is flagrant in his trafficking of contraband goods. His orders are to guard the great wooden bridge to stave off the insect swarms. But our investigators report that he simply stands to the side and watches as the swarm rolls through. You are to execute this man for his treason and bring me his helm. Then, we will talk. <P>Go North Karana<BR>Go north of the wooden bridge, near wall<P>You begin tracking Guard Shilster.<BR>Guard Shilster scowls at you, ready to attack -- You could probably win this fight.<BR>You have slain Guard Shilster!<BR>Your faction standing with CorruptQeynosGuards got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got better.<BR>Your faction standing with KaneBayle got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with CircleOfUnseenHands got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with BloodSabers got worse.<BR>--You have looted a Cracked Corrupt Guard Helm.--<P>Run back to Qeynos<BR>You say, 'Hail, Vegalys Keldrane'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'Thank you for bringing this person to justice. Please read this manual very, VERY carefully. Commit it to memory. We do everything strictly by the book. We are a people of law and order and I simply won't tolerate a breach of protocol. Investigators are expected to accurately report findings, are authorized to issue warrants and to notarize official documents for all lands under the jurisdiction of Antonius Bayle and the council. I sincerely hope you can earn your Investigator's Badge. <BR>Your faction standing with AntoniusBayle got better.<BR>Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got better.<BR>Your faction standing with RingofScale got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with KaneBayle got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with MerchantsofQeynos got better.<BR>You gain experience!!<BR>(Ring of Scale? Thats strange!)<P>Going South Qeynos, At tree at south of Lions Mane tavern meet an investigator in yellow robe, human asian looking.<BR>Give the book, soi you can&#8217;t read it anymore.<P>an investigator says 'Grouping with Durix'<BR>an investigator says 'Very well, let's get to work. I assume you have read the briefing and committed it to memory. This is how you will be tested. I shall play the part of student and you shall play the master who directs me. I promise I won't make it easy on you either, we want only the best. We'll see how you do and then I'll decide if you are worthy to wear the badge or not. <P>You say, 'where is the first suspect ?'<BR>an investigator says 'The first suspect was last seen near the shop called Fireprides. <BR>(Its the store who sell armors near bank)<P>You say, 'follow me'<BR>an investigator says 'Following Master.'<BR>The investigator foillow you like a pet but the pathing of S Qeynos is VERY buggy so you need to wait and go very slowly of you want the investigator to really follow you. Each time you ask for a confession, you have to ask the investigator to follow you again.<P>You say, 'are you a member of the bloodsabers ?'<BR>Riley Shplots shakes visibly and says, 'Oh, no. I knew this would happen one day. Please don't hurt me! I had very little to do with this plague, though it is quite a nice one, you must admit. I was just a courier. I'll come quietly. I don't want any trouble. My small contribution to the glory of Bertoxxulous has already been given but I certainly don't want to go to meet him just yet!' <P>You say, 'give me a confession document '<BR>an investigator says 'Here you are. <P>You say, 'summon a guard'<BR>Guard Sylus says 'Come along, prisoner. <P>You say, 'where is the second suspect ?'<BR>an investigator says 'The second suspect was sighted below the Grounds of Fate. <BR>(under the arena, near the cells)<P>You say, 'follow me'<P>You say, 'are you a member of the Bloodsabers ?'<BR>Willie Garrote says 'A Bloodsaber? Of course I'm not, don't be ridiculous! <P>You say, 'give me a confession document'<BR>an investigator says 'Here you are. <P>You say, 'summon a guard'<BR>Guard Sylus says 'Come along, fiend. We haven't far to go. <P>You say, 'where is the third suspect ?'<BR>an investigator says 'The last suspect has been known to hang around that low life known as Raz the Rat. <BR>(near the docks, on the shore)<P>You say, 'follow me'<BR>an investigator says 'Following Master.'<P>You say, 'are you a Bloodsabers ?'<BR>Donally Stultz says 'Of course I'm a Bloodsaber, you fool! I've just returned from the Plains of Karana where I was reveling in the glory of the Plaguebringer. Now then, since I see that this foolish investigator is with you, I suppose you want me to sign a confession document or something like that? Well, let's have it then! <P>You say, 'give me a confession document'<BR>an investigator says 'Here you are. <P>Donally Stultz crumples the document into a ball, throws it to the ground and spits in your face, yelling, 'You are a fool if you really believe I would sign such a thing. Prepare to die!' <BR>Donally Stultz shouts 'Watch in horror as I show this fool the wrath of the Plaguebringer! <BR>Donally Stultz says 'Druids like you always bring out the worst in me!'<BR>You have slain Donally Stultz!<BR>Donally Stult says 'You. . . can not. . . defeat us all. . . <BR>Donally Stult's skin melts.<BR>--You have looted a Head of Donally Stultz.--<P>Give 2 confessions and one head<P>an investigator says 'You have done our city a great service and helped to bring several criminals to justice this day! Wear this Investigator's Badge with pride! Speak again with Vegalys Keldrane, he may have information about [advancing further] in rank. <BR>Your faction standing with AntoniusBayle got better.<BR>Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got better.<BR>Your faction standing with RingofScale got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with KaneBayle got worse.<BR>Your faction standing with MerchantsofQeynos got better.<BR>You gain experience!!<P>Get Investigator badge<P>You say, 'I want to advance further in rank'<BR>Vegalys Keldrane says 'At this point, I am mainly in need of loyal and trustworthy investigators. I must first gather information on who these people are and exactly how far their influences stretch. However, once I begin to implement the next phase of this operation, you may be able to assist us once again if you prove to be talented enough. For now, simply continue to observe and report.<P>--------------------<P>Larch
