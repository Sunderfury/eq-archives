              hour farming spree of Crushbone where we took control of the castle 
              to launch our in-game KGB spy network! Around 7:00 pm Elrood and 
              Brodie pleaded for the guild to come free them from the horrible 
              tortures of the Rearindicator. It finally dawned upon us that with

              gave us some trouble at first, but we regrouped and took his ass

              ass dead on the ground. Was a absolute blast dropping him considering 
              all the trouble he's given us, and root! Way to go everyone mahaha

 Loot off of Vindi was a pair of <a href=/images/news/march25/vindicatorboots.jpg>Boot's

              wears the boots of piss stains, congratulations foo! Then his head 
              was violently removed by a pack of rabid cantaloupe, white storks 
              cleaned the giant's head, wrapped it in a diaper and delivered it 
              to Archie. The sad part is Archie is carrying it around thinking 
              he just had a baby. Grats on your <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/glovesofearthcrafting.jpg>new 
              gloves</a>!<br>
              <br>
 Now for the next challenge mahahaha! Tomorrow (Sunday) Triton will 
              be killing Zlandicar in DN. Your mission, should you choose to accept, 
              is to make a level one halfing with the name of a famous boxer, 
              and run him from Rivervale to Dragon Necropolis. Winner gets a pat 
              on the back, a date with Root, and their life story posted here. 
              (Bonus points to those who guess the halfing model I use!)<br>
