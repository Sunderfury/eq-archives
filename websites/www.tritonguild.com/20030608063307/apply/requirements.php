      lot as well. If you can't take this kind of thing on a daily basis, don't 
      sign up... this guild isn't for the weak touchy-feely types. If you can

      once a week for 2 hours you are no use to us. If you can't make at least 
      60% of all raids (and we raid every night just about) then you are of no

      time and/or prevents you from performing to your fullest don't apply. This

      AA, and those applying that meet that requirement will get special attention 
      during the application process.</font></font></td>
