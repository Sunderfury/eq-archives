              and tacticians of Triton gathered two days after the release of 
              Kunark at Triton Imperial Space Command Center. The purpose of the 
              meeting was to strategize the efficiency of the new Triton Mutation 
              Engine. Authorization was given to spawn the first Iksar Twink of 
              Povar. At the press of a button, gene sequencers and photon reconstructers 
              phoboplasted Tpau to life. He hatched at level 60 and his first 
              spoken words were 'Tranquil Staff'.<br>

              Many months and alts later, we're proud to announce the broodling 
              hatched from our mutation engine has won Povar's best of the best 
              monk tournament. Way to go, now get back to leveling your rogue,

              is going to be brief and filled with screen shots. As many people 
              know we've been in PoM for two days now, we even were lucky enough 
              to have Ester the Tester and a few GMs moving in and out through 
              out the zone talking with us today. Basically I'll sum this zone 
              up for you, It's madness. Not only is the architecture different 
              than other zones, but the way the zone is setup cannot be defined 
              as a dungeon, a quest zone, or a plane. It simply is WHACKED.<br>

              the zone was not complete for the time we've been there, leaving 
              us with a few problems with getting stuck, and absolutely no loot. 
              However Ester the Tester promised us herself that in tomorrow's 
              patch the zone would be 'much more fun' and that several issues 
              we brought up with her will be corrected.<br>
              <br>
              Other than that, the zone has been absolutely great and we've enjoyed 
              ourselves tremendously. Honestly I am in awe over the zone and the 
              work that was put in to creating this masterpiece, my hat is off 
              to whoever designed this zone, the npcs in it, and the theme. All
