              Triton inteligence recieved a ransom demand from Queen Dicksock 
              herself. The whore of Chardok took Team Varsity hostage in an attempt 
              to gain leadership of our guild. Her demand was posted on EQVault 
              and can be found <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=8928971&start=8928971">here</a>. 
              Having provoked Team Varsity to her lair by stealing Benton's Power 
              Leveling Guide, she set a trap causing us to lose some of our top 
              players. This would not stand. Zaar called forth an attack on Queen 
              Dicksock in the name of recovering Benton's Power Leveling guide, 
              we really didn't care about Team Varsity themselves.<br>
              <br>
              In record time we made our way past the Prince, the King and to 
              Murdercore 2000 err I mean Queen Dicksock. Sure enough the whore 
              did have Team Varsity strapped up in bondage gear against her wall. 
              A charge was called and the bitch was killed. Results of the night 
              were two very sweet ancient blades given to Geldion and Krohn to 
              complete their epics. Pure and Dolmat also were given King notes.<br>

              phoboplasted Tpau to life. He hatched at level 60 and his first

              with 15 people and walked away content that we spent another four 
              hours of our lives at the Goodwill loot center of EQ. Cebarsis scored 
              a pair of suspenders with his new <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/spiritweaversbreastplate.jpg">Spirit 
              Weaver Chest Plate</a>. Dainja picked up a cured silk tunic err

              out.<br>

              All in all it was a pretty fucking fun day, alas 5:38 am I must 
              get some sleep. So in closing, I offer you some screen shots of 
              today, and the best of all, some advice. Drink your school, go to 
              drugs, don't do milk. Also it's highly suggested to invest in any 
              form of coconuts or bananas within the following month. <font size="-10" color="#FFFFFF">The

                    don't know how many people other then Triton visit our page, 
                    and if they do I have no idea what there impression of us 
                    is but... tonight we kicked some ass. Killing this guy it 
                    nothing like killing Trakanon, VS or even Veeshan's Peaks 
                    Dragons. We took 3 runs at him, the final fight lasting a 
                    good 10 minutes... I think the total combined damage that 
                    he dished out over the course of 3 fights was somewhere in 
                    the ballpark of 450,000 damage. To be honest it was simply 
                    amazing and easily the best fight I ever took part in. The 
                    loots were nice, I scored a Necro bracer, ac 10 +5 sta +10 
                    cha +9 int +10 str +35 mana +45 hp effect : ignite bones, 
                    and Crystalstar picked up a wizzy bracer which for the life 
                    of me I can't remember except it cast something. All in all, 
                    it was simply an incredible fight and one of those nights 
                    where I was stoked to be in the guild I'm in ;) Oh and we 
                    killed that Lord Dojinininin or whatever who doesn't even 
                    really deserve mention since he's absolutely fuck all compared 
                    to his boss. Oh, and we got VS.. grats archie and oishii on 
                    some new legs ;) </FONT></B>
