              the statue of Ralos Zek. Our last visit with him left a bad taste 
              in our mouth, but no where near as bad as Root's on a Saturday morning, 
              who knows how many times he swallowed. The statue put up good fight 
              the first run, we got him to 0% health with 3 adds. The second time 
              we fucking beat his ass down, had about 7 deaths on that run. So 
              we did our thing and created the Statue of Mr. T Marx, in recognition 
              of their outstanding work to the Triton guildchat.</b></font></p><br>

              beat the shit out of our favorite ass loot mobs today. Klandicar 
              the hermaphrodite, Root's very own identical twin and Velkwhore 
              the Sor..Dumbfuck, also known as the smile and pretend you give 
              a fuck about the caster's loot mob.<br>
              <br>
              The call was made at 5:00 pm mst to gather at Dragon Nerfropolis. 
              We slapped around a few buffs and prepared to attack. Our favorite 
              'Movie Mockery Mofo' Krellixious Decimus Meridus gave the order 
              to charge, then immediately logged off to level Arlan and Cebarsis. 
              The only death was our brave Enchaladin Pircilis, she foolishly 
              tried to melee Klandicar and was promptly crushed.<br>

<p><b><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1 color=#000000>Our 
              favorite Hermaphrodite was bitch slapped twice before surrendering 
              to the bad ass mother fuckers known as Triton. Congratulations to 
              Heihachi on his Klandicar's Talisman for his ST key. Specki picked 
              up a pair of <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/peerlessdragonlegbreeches.jpg>Peerless 
              Dragonleg Breeches</a>. Seugor our resident pimp gnome rogue jacked 
              a new pair of fine quality pimped out <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/peerlessdragonhidegauntlets.jpg>bitch 
              slapping gloves</a>. After loot was distributed someone commented 
              it was early still and the casters were planning another revolt 
              against the Triton leadership. Half the guilded ninja ported to 
              Great Divide, leaving 12 people defenseless to be slaughtered by 
              Ice Burrowers.<br>
              <br>
              Eventually Wolfherz bitched enough in guild chat to get everyone 
              over to Velkwhore's. However, he became so disruptive and offensive 
              in guildchat he was temporarily removed, allowing the damaged moral 
              of Triton to recover. Let's face it, Wolfherz is a real bastard. 
              After that incident we quickly set through the dungeon and came 
              to the door of our caster's twisted view of fulfillment. <br>
              <br>
              Krohn ran to his door, pounded twice and ran away. Velkwhore, curious 
              at the knocking cautiously crept out of of his lair to find 36 
              Tritons ready to send his punk ass back to Russia. Velkwhore, who 
              evidently is the one responsible for funding the Leveon flames on 
              EQVault *<a href=http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=9929607&replies=209>cough</a>*,

<b><FONT face='Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif' size=-1>Thanks for the statement Zaar... That did us a lot of good, you should write your own fucking editorial column. Now on to what's going on this weekend. With it being St. Patrick's day weekend, we're a bit short of the classes needed to do some serious raiding (Fucking clerics, POSERS! All of you.) We hit up the two biggest gimps of VP last night, Silverpuss and Dykegoz for some quick and easy loot.

<br>
<br>
              Silverpuss dropped <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/scimitaroflifestealing.jpg>'The' 
              Scimitar of Life Stealing</a>, which was given to Krellyk for being

              robes</a> known to man. Congratulations to those two asshole mother 
              fuckers Intelligent and Shakwon. Dykegoz then went on to put out 
              a piece of pubic tongue spam gimp shit homosexual <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/malevolentruneblade.jpg>Malevolent 
              Ruined Blade</a> which went to Heka. The dumb fuck's last drop was

<br>
              You see, I'm that much cooler now that I just cussed over twenty 
              times in one paragraph. For those of you who DON'T understand, and 
              continue to post in the name of god on EQVault and the EQForums, 
              this is entertainment. If you don't like it, peace the fuck out 
              because you're wasting my bandwith. And even though Mr. T did hack 
              us, I'm going to leave his update because I'm too lazy to rewrite 
              that. No real screen shots from today other than myself giving Nene 
              a hard time about getting her epic. <font color=#FF0000>Congratulations
