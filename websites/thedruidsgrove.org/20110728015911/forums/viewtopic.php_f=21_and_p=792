			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">World of Warcraft Client Patch 4.1</span><br /><br /><br /><br />Notes for all World of Warcraft patches can be found <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/" class="postlink">here</a>.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2514161#blog" class="postlink">Rise of the Zandalari</a></span><br /><span style="font-style: italic"><br />The days when great troll empires stretched across ancient Kalimdor are long past. Millennia of war and internal strife have stripped these nations of their power, lands, and glory. As Azeroth recovers from the destruction of the Cataclysm, the world's divided troll populations face a bleak future. These dark times have spurred the trolls of the Zandalar, the historically wise and scholarly tribe from which all trolls originated, to take drastic action. They have embarked on a bold crusade to save their race by uniting trolls into a single mighty empire. With the Zandalari's aid, the fallen capitals of the Gurubashi and Amani nations—Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman—are already rebuilding, replenishing their forces for a bloody campaign to expand their territories. <br /><br />Yet Vol'jin and his Darkspear trolls are not aligned with the Zandalari. They have sworn to stand with their Horde comrades—and even work with the Alliance—should the trolls ignite a new war on Azeroth. Soon, Vol'jin might be forced to act on his promise, for if the Gurubashi and Amani are left to their own devices, the world will know the legendary strength and savagery of the ancient troll empires once again.<br /></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2534919" class="postlink">Guild Challenges</a></span><br /><br />Built into the Info panel of the guild user interface, Guild Challenges are weekly tasks guild groups can tackle for additional guild experience, achievements, and gold. At the top of the guild user interface Info pane, a new Guild Challenges section is displayed and broken into three categories: Dungeons, Raids, and Rated Battlegrounds. Any guild group will qualify for Guild Challenges credit and there is a set number of times each challenge can be completed per week.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2657799" class="postlink">Guild Finder</a></span><br /><br />Guild Finder is a new system designed to enable easier and faster guild recruitment. Guild leaders and players who are looking for a guild to call home will use the Guild Finder to meet one another and begin communications that can lead to a prosperous membership. Whether you're a guild leader looking to fill your ranks or a player looking for a guild that meets your strictest requirements, the Guild Finder provides an easy way to make new friends!<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2568337#blog" class="postlink">Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms</a></span><br /><br />A new system intended to lower queue times, Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms offers additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role. To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random level-85 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a goodie bag that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/potion, a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Table of Contents</span></span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic"><strike>Click a link to jump directly to the corresponding section of the patch notes.</strike></span><br /><br /><br /><ul><li>General</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Classes: General<br /><ul><li>Death Knights, Druids, Hunters, Mages, Paladins, Priests, Rogues, Shaman, Warlocks, Warriors</li></ul></li><li>Dungeons &amp; Raids</li><li>Guilds</li><li>Items</li><li>Professions</li><li>PvP</li><li>Quests &amp; Creatures</li><li>Races</li><li>User Interface</li></ul><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">General</span><br /><ul><li>Conquest Points are now purchasable from the Valor Quartermasters at 250 Conquest Points per 250 Valor Points.</li><li>Honor Points are now purchasable from the Justice Trade Goods vendors at 250 Honor Points per 375 Justice Points.</li><li>Justice Points are now purchasable from the Honor Trade Goods vendors at 250 Justice Points per 375 Honor Points.</li><li>Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40 resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to 10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as their resilience climbs.</li><li>A dead player can now be resurrected by targeting them using the Party or Raid Frame even if they have released.

The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player.</li></ul><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/class/death-knight" class="postlink">Death Knights</a></span><br /><ul><li>Dark Simulacrum now works on numerous additional spells in dungeon encounters.</li><li>Raise Ally has been redesigned to be a battle resurrection, analogous to Rebirth.

It creates a healing zone at the feet of a Swiftmend target, but this healing zone now restores health equal to 4/8/12% of the amount healed by Swiftmend to the three most injured targets within 8 yards, every 1 second for 7 seconds. This periodic effect now also benefits from spell haste, but the individual ticks cannot be critical effects. In addition, Living Seed is no longer a prerequisite talent for Efflorescence.</li><li>Malfurion's Gift now reduces the cooldown of Tranquility by 2.5/5 minutes.</li><li>Nature's Swiftness now also increases the healing done by the affected nature spell by 50%.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Glyphs<br /><ul><li>Glyph of Rake is now Glyph of Pounce, which increases the range of Pounce by 3 yards.</li></ul></li><li>Druid Bug Fixes<br /><ul><li>The troll druid models for Flight Form and Swift Flight Form has slimmed down to be more in scale with other druid flight forms.</li></ul></li></ul><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/class/hunter" class="postlink">Hunters</a></span><br /><ul><li>Deterrence no longer requires a melee weapon to be equipped.</li><li>Explosive Trap now has a new spell effect.</li><li>Master's Call now has a new spell effect.</li><li>Multi-Shot damage has been increased by 250%.</li><li>Tame Beast now tames pets to match the hunter's level, rather than 3 levels below.</li><li>Pets<br /><ul><li>The Feed Pet ability now instantly heals 50% of the pet's health.
