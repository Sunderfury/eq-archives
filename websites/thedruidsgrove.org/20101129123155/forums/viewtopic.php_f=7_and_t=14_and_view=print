Currently, I'm level 65(druid) with 48aas, and using a warrior merc.  Also, boxing a lvl 65 beastlord with a cleric merc, and he's got 50aas.</div>

Druid or Warder will need to snare because they run at low health. Diamonds and variouse other things sell very well to vendors. The Ore and Poison supplies sells very well to players in the bazaar (dependant on server)<br />2) Blackfeather Roost (Caves on ground floor/Harpies on second level, TSS Zone) Once you learn what has value...it is a treasure trove of goodies to sell to merchants.<br />3) Crypt of Nardox (Undead, LoY Zone) They drop gems!<br />4) BoT or PoFire (Earth/South or Castle 1 Repectively, PoP Zone(s)) Kills may be slower than the first 3 but xp will be much better in Fire than any I have listed until now.<br />5) Hole (Castle/Caves, Original EQ) Lots of gems, jewlery, $$$ loot. XP wont be great but BST can tank it all so only need Cleric Merc unluss you want faster kills.<br />6) DSH (Farm, SoF) <span style="font-weight: bold">Would have to be grouped for this </span>but the xp is awsome and most of the stuff goes to rot because kills are so fast. (Its also why I left this one at #6)<br />7) LDoN (Recomend North Ro or Everfrost) 3-5 AA's a run depending if you finish task or clear dungeon. Takes 45+ minutes once you learn them. Grab a collect or MK. Collections seem to have better vendor loot fyi but that may be personal opinion and not fact. Grab a collect (easy or hard, i usually do hard with tank merc), collect all but the last one, then clear the dungeon. Corpses have 27 minute rot so plenty of time to come back and loot for items to sell back to vendors.</div>
