In 1986, the top 1% of earners (usually those making around $1 million or more) paid about 25% of federal income taxes.  In 1996, it was 32%.  In 2000, it was 37%.  In 2007, it was 40%.<br /><br />In the last reported year, the top 1% were responsible for paying 40% of the income taxes.

His principal contributions were the powerful, widely read pamphlet Common Sense (1776), advocating colonial America's independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and The American Crisis (1776–1783), a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series.

Or the Constitution.<br />He held no political office in America.<br /><br />I agree with Adams wholeheartedly.<br />But I still consider Adams and Washington Americans, and Paine a Brit.  And a hero of mine.  Call him what you like, I am sure he considered himself British.</div>

			<div class="content">[/quote=&quot;Tudamorf]<br />You don't know what you're talking about.  Wealthy people pay a fortune in taxes.<br /><br />And if you invest in non-taxable sources (like municipal bonds), you get a much lower return.  That's not a &quot;loophole&quot;, it's a federally created municipal subsidy.<br /><br />Your high standard of living, which you no doubt take for granted, is almost entirely paid for by wealthy people.[/quote]<br /><br />I didn't say they didn't pay a fortune in taxes. I said they don't pay the same % of their net income in taxes. They pay lower. People get caught up in the fact that they pay &quot;X&quot; amount of money. And that &quot;X&quot; is very large compared to what they make (They = lower/middle class) so they think they are spending all this money on taxes. When the truth is they are paying a lower % compared to those making less moeny. Thats why when politicians always go quoting what a person pays in taxes they never say the % of what they pay but what they payed. If they compared %'s they would lose the argument.<br /><br />Rich people don't invest in non-taxable bonds, well any signifigant amount at least. The return is too low. They do invest in other funds that are more risky but have a better return. And the bonus of these investments are that if they fail, its a tax write off. If they succeed, they don't pay any tax on the return investment until they withdraw the money. The trick (and loophole) is withdrawing them in a manner that you don't have to pay taxes on them when you finally withdraw the money. It requires intimate knowledge of tax codes but the deductions to get this money tax free exists. It just requires losing money on something (buisness expense that you would normally lose money on) you would do normally in order to offset the investment you made. An easy example that even lower/middle class Americans would understand is dry cleaning/gasoline/vehicle maintanance you can write off if you own your own buisness. They just do it on a much bigger scale than what I stated. They use the loss they would normally incur as a price of doing buisness so they don't pay the taxes on the withdrawing of their investments.<br /><br />I actually make 40k as a family. Yes, its higher than some but I would hardly call it a high standard of living. And my standard of living is paid for by tax payers because I work for the people(school aid and wife is a teacher). When I worked in the private sector, the people who paid me were not wealthy. They were my (our) customers. The money that paid my checks didn't come out of the owners pockets. Yes, it was money the owner made but the people who bought our products made approx. the amount I made (barely over min. wage) according to accounting/HR. So they money they recieved was recycled money they paid to us in the first place. And to top it off, for every $1 spent on our product, 80% of it went to the manager(s). So technically, $1 dollar became $0.20 wich became $0.04, ect....This model worked because you have hundreds of customers (and they spent more that $1 on our products). There was a reason that are buisiest part of the season was around spring. Thats when tax returns came around. December was often our slowest month, when most people are scraping by.</div>

They are a private buisness. You should know this. Mabye it was late for you when you posted. The people who pay for cops are funded by local taxes, and usually by property owners and/or sales tax. State police...ditto. Homeland Security, CIA, FBI are all funded by Federal Taxes.</span><br /><br />The K-12 budget for California alone is about $60 billion.  Who do you think pays the overwhelming majority of that?<span style="color: #FF0000">I don't live in California, but assuming your tax structure is the common Republican structure, the Property owners, local taxes, and the lottery. And considering that most people who play the lottery are those in poverty. 3.5 billion from the lottery in 2005/2006. (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?California-Lottery-History-and-Education&amp;id=5323889">http://ezinearticles.com/?California-Lo ... id=5323889</a><!-- m -->). Considering that their are more property owners who make less than 250k, I would say the middle class. I would say the rich support education, but most likely at the University level and private school level for k-12. </span><br /><br />And the &quot;loopholes&quot; you think exist either never existed, or were closed decades ago, during the Reagan-era reforms.  For example, you can only offset $3,000 of capital losses against ordinary income and there are limits to using passive losses to offset other income.<span style="color: #FF0000">Well, actually the tax loop holes still exist. When I got hired they had a nice retirement specialist talk to us. Guess what one of the things they talked about. Investing money in tax free buisnesses that you can then claim for tax losses if they fail. They still exist and mabye in California they closed/capped this loop-hole. But I would wager that if you are a buisness that makes 250k+ you have options. BTW, these loop holes were created by Reagan to promote small buisnesses. Considering that most buisnesses have a 50%+ fail rate, and you only make money when they suceed. You can figure out the amount of money you have to invest to get a sizable return. Unless you got lucky with Google (or similary start up company), it will take many years to see any kind of profit if you see any profit at all. But if you have money to throw away, with no risk or losing it thanks to tax write-offs, its a solid investment (You were going to lose it to the Government otherwise)</span></div>
