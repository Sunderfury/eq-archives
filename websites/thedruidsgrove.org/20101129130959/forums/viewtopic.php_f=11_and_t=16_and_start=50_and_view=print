Shall it be 'Special Selection', 'Divine Mandate' or 'Genetic Superiority' to justify these millions of income ond bonusses?</div></blockquote><br />You didn't answer my question.<br /><br />If you come up with a business plan that takes a $2 billion (soon to be dead) company and turns it into a $285 billion company, how much do you think you should be paid?<br /><blockquote><div><cite>erianaiel wrote:</cite>But the answer that I believe is true is: No, I do not think that it requires any special or unique -skill- to attain such a position. You will have to be part of the current elite to be -invited- to one, but I have yet to see any evidence that the people who almost ran our collective economies into the ground were any more intelligent, skillful or plain and simple special to hold the positions they did.</div></blockquote><br />What elite was Steve Jobs part of prior to running Apple?<br /><br />And he didn't run his company into the ground.  His successor did after he was forced out, and when he was finally reinstated he turned into the second most valuable company in the world.<br /><br />You really think that doesn't require skill?</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>erianaiel wrote:</cite><br />Oooh. Shall it be 'Special Selection', 'Divine Mandate' or 'Genetic Superiority' to justify these millions of income ond bonusses?<br /><br />I will leave it to you to find out what those three faulty reasonings actually are, though I will give you a hint that the first is a heresy, the second a discredited basis of government and the third, well, would not want to invoke Godwin's law about that one.<br /><br />Eri</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well, I don't know about in your country.<br /><br />But here it is a matter of persuasion and negotiation.<br />Someone attempts to persuade the owners of a company(the shareholders) that he or she can run the company in such a way, that would warrant their salary.<br />It is a negotiated amount.<br />The owners, or their delegates, either approve of or disapprove of the salary.<br /><br />Disapproval happens all the time, much more often than approval.  That is when CEO types are fired, or are not hired.  And then they start the process again over at another company.<br /><br />The knowledge of not only what is persuasive, but also the ability to persuade, and to negotiate that is part of the job description.  Not just what gets them hired in the first place.<br /><br />Tudamorf's example of Jobs, is a perfect example.  He not only persuaded the company to take him back.  But he has persuaded millions of Apple product users to buy Apple products.  What is his salary, a dollar a year.  He has persuaded the company to allow him to take most of his compensation in essentially investments and perks.  And they have persuaded him to likewise take a dollar a year salary, and investment perks.  That is negotiation.  A skill that very few people possess.  But it is a skill which is rewarded, highly in demand, and low in supply.</div>

You just presumed that what I wrote meant something in particular and refused to reconsider even after I told  you you were wrong about your presumptions. In other words, you set up a loaded question and I am not going to play into that by answering.<br /><br /><br />Eri</div>
