				<div class="content">According to Blizzard (my account was locked out for some reason), it has been ~440 days since I last used my account.  A lot has changed in the game even before the recent 4.0 update.  I have a few questions regarding some of these changes, if you could take a few seconds to answer some/all of these it would be really great!<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>The new LFG thingy looks really cool.  Does it assign me to groups with similar gear levels?  I only have Naxx10/25 and a couple of Ulduar pieces, so I don't want to get matched up with folks that are well past my gear, and rusty, skill level.  Do I need to worry?</li><li>One of the biggest, if not the biggest, mistakes I made in LK was to drop mining for Inscription (I still have herbalism).  That cost me 6-8K g that I never really recovered and sort of made me feel like I was always playing catch-up money wise.  I'd really, really, really, like to drop Inscription (currently 447/450??) for skinning or mining.  Crafting professions are not for me.  Any thoughts?  This lame duck period would be a great time for me to level mining/skinning.  Is there any reason to keep/level inscription any more?</li><li>Addons:  I use to use pitbull for Unit/Raid Frames and auctioneer, gatherer.  Should I go grab those or has something better come along?  I've seen hints that there are a few newer Feral Druid addons but I can't find specifics.  Any ideas?</li><li>I'm sure I'll dream up a few more questions, so stay tuned...</li></ol><br />Thanks.<br /><br />FWIW, I'm currently a horde dual-spec Bear/Cat druid.  Though it looks like I'm going to switching to alliance once cata is released. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> Thankfully, I'll never have to be a NE. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">1. AFAIK, LFG tries to match you with folks of similar gearing, but it doesn't always do a good job of it.  I wouldn't worry too much though. <br /><br />2. For my money's worth, I'd say switch back to mining if that's what you enjoy.  It may not be the wisest thing to do fiscally, or from a min/max standpoint, but it's not like you're making your character so gimped as to be unplayable.  Maybe at the highest levels - 'bleeding edge progression' - but not for anyone else.<br /><br />3. Pitbull, Auctioneer, and Gatherer are all still out there, and being updated for 4.0.1.  Feral specific addons?  I like Bad Kitty and Hear Kitty.  The first one puts a grid of indicators up on the screen to make it easy to prioritize what ability needs to be refreshed for max kitty dps.  It has bear functionality too, but I haven't used it for that.  Hear Kitty plays audible cues to alert you to your combo point status - as a part time feral I have difficulty tracking everything, and find the sounds much easier to keep track of than yet another indicator on the screen.<br /><br />Welcome Back!</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks.<br /><br />Last night I went through and sold just every piece of gear I had that wasn't obviously cat or bear (I had full+ set of tree and chicken stuff in my bags/bank) and purged anything of lower item level that for some reason only know to myself 1.5 years ago, I was still hanging onto.  I went ahead and made a few Druid glyphs for myself as well from mats I had lying around.  I think I need to get one more, then I'll drop it for mining.<br /><br />Actually, mining would be easier to level after the Cata since I could fly in the old word, but I'll do it now while I have so much down time.<br /><br />Thanks for the tips on the addons.</div>
