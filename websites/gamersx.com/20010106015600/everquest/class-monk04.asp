Below is a list of skills you'll get at each level and howyou should use them.  Remember when you get a new skill you have to train it once at your guild before you can start using it and improving in it.  Dodge is the only first level skill this applies to.

<P><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=#FF6600><B>Level 1</B></FONT><P><P>
<P>
<b>Dodge:</b>  You need to put 1 train into this skill as soon as you make your character otherwise it will not be used or improved.  Dodge is the chance of you completely avoiding a blow that otherwise would have done you damage.  At first you will hardly ever dodge a blow, the by about level 10 you'll see it happening more often.  By about level 20 you should dodge at least 1 or 2 blows per fight.  It may not seem like much but every bit counts in a big fight.  Dodge just happens; there's nothing you can do to improve or utilize the skill other than fight regularly.
<P>
<b>Dual Wield:</b>  Dual wield is the ability to wield two weapons at once and monks are the only class to begin with this skill (warriors and rogues have to wait until level 12 and 17).  In theory this means you can hit with both fists every round of combat but you won't see this happening regularly until the skill gets over 100 (level 15).  In the beginning, you'll punch with both hands maybe once or twice per fight but this will gradually increase as you rise in level.  Don't bother trying to dual wield weapons for the reasons stated in the equipment section.  This skill will raise naturally as you fight.  Don't carry anything in your off hand such as a lantern or fire beetle eye or you won't dual wield and this skill will not increase.  Strangely this skill maxes out 20-30 points higher than the others.
<P>
<b>Hand to Hand:</b>  This is what you'll live by.  This skill will improve the most quickly since you use it constantly.  It dictates your likelihood to hit and how much damage you do.  You'll start off doing very little damage and then will start punching for about 10 points of damage by level 5.  At 10th the max you can do goes up to 12 and at 15th you'll start punching for 15 points of damage.  One monk who'd reached 35th said he was punching for 35 points of damage and consistently hitting 4 times per round.  
<P>
<b>Kick:</b>  Kick is your first secondary attack.  It doesn't refresh very quickly so you can only use it about once every 3 rounds.  It will improve a little slower than your other combat skills since you use it less often but should still max out by about third or 4th level and will easily max out after that.  Kick does about 6 or 7 damage when you become proficient at it.  But you won't be using it after you hit 5th because that's when you'll be using round kick.
<P>
<b>Mend:</b> Mend is the ability to instantly heal 1/4 of your hitpoints.  This can be done either during or after combat.  During combat it can be the difference between life and death; afterwards it can seriously reduce downtime.  You can only use mend once every 6 minutes real time, or 4 times per day game time.  Basically, it's the Paladin's Lay Hands ability broken into 4 segments (this can be an advantage and a disadvantage depending on the situation).  There is one major difference though: mend has a percentage chance of working based on your skill in it and does not always work.  One of three things can happen when you hit Mend, two of which are bad: 1) your mend succeeds and you gain 1/4 of your hit points back 2) your mend fails and you gain no hit points 3) or you occasionally get the dreaded "You have worsened your wounds" message and you lose 1/4 of your hit points, which is the equivelant of death in a close fight.  To put it simply, at 1st level it will only have 10% chance of working (assuming the skill is maxed).  At 10th is has a 55% chance of working.  When you finally hit 19th it becomes a reliable skill but it's still not failsafe.  You have a 98% chance of succeeding, 1% chance of failing and 1% chance of worsening your wounds.  Raising your mend is an arduous and agonizing process since it recycles so slowly and is so unreliable at early levels.  I put 2 or 3 training points in at every level to help keep it maxed and to give that extra little bit at the beginning of each level.  I don't know why they made it such an unpredictable and sometimes dangerous skill.  The failing to mend wounds is frustrating but tolerable.  But the worsening wounds is just too much in my opinion.  After all, Lay Hands never backfires and kills the paladin, nor do a wizard's spells ever backfire and reduce him to ashes.  So why do monks have this danger? Even at high levels?  I suppose to make life interesting. 
<P>
<b>Throwing:</b>  This is a handy skill in that it allows you to lure monsters from a distance.  It can also be a real life saver on the pvp server since it's a method of interrupting a caster's spells if you can't reach them with your fists and feet (while rooted for instance).  Monks can use shuriken and throwing knives but not bow and arrow or throwing axes.  Once you past 5th or 6th you'll have the money to start buying these weapons en masse to begin practicing and raising the skill.  Definitely worth developing.

<P><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=#FF6600><B>Level 3</B></FONT><P><P>

<b>Safe Fall:</b> When you hit level 3 you should save at least 1 train for safe fall.  As you run around Norrath, you'll find that it's easy to run too quickly down a hillside or step off the edge of a wall and take some significant damage from the fall.  Safe fall will either soften the blow or prevent the damage completely depending on your proficiency.  It's not an essential skill by any means nor is it one to really get excited about.  But it is nice to hear your other friends taking damage from falls while you land softly on your feet.  It's not too hard to practice if you find a suitable spot.  Just find a place that does about 1 or 2 points of damage when you step off and repeat.  You''ll quickly stop taking damage but it will still improve your skill.  I personally didn't put much priority into this skill and would only practice it on the boat ride from Freeport to Butcher Block Mountains by jumping from one deck to another.  But even with a skill of 35 it was a handy thing to have.

<P><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=#FF6600><B>Level 5</B></FONT><P><P>

<b>Round Kick:</b> At level 5 you get your first new move and it's a cool looking one.  Round kick refreshes at the same rate as kick but does up to 15 damage when you get the skill maxed out.  I personally wouldn't recommend putting more than 1 train into this skill since it only takes about 1 level of experience to max out if you use it constantly.  You'll miss a lot at first but you'll soon see yourself landing for more damage than kick so it's worth the effort.  All special attacks from round kick onward are considered magical and can hit invulnerable creatures so even if you don't have netted or woven gloves, you can still hit invulnerable creatures with one of your attacks.

<P><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=#FF6600><B>Level 8</B></FONT><P><P>

<b>Sneak:</b>  Not a particularly useful skill but easy to practice so worth keeping maxed out.  Sneak allows you to move silently and sneak up to or past aggressive monsters so long as the skill is high enough and you stay out of their sight line.  Personally I thought that it should make you invisible to players and monsters alike once the skill was high enough, but the powers that be have determined that only casters will have any kind of advantage in this game.  I've never really found a use for sneak but some people like to use it to get the first hit on stationary monsters.

<P><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=#FF6600><B>Level 10</B></FONT><P><P>

<b>Tiger Claw:</b>  Tiger claw is the next special move in the chain of monk evolution.  It will seem like a step down for the first two levels but you'll quickly realize that this move has more potential.  Tiger claw only hits for up to 12 damage but it refreshes twice as quickly as round kick so you can do more damage with it over the course of a fight.  It is painfully slow to raise though and will probably not max out until late 12th or early 13th level.  Once it is maxed out, you'll never look back though.  All of the misses and hits for 1 point of damage may make you think you'd be better off using round kick, but believe me when I say the pain is worth it.  Stick with it.

<b>Block: </b> Block allows you to parry a blow that would otherwise have caused you damage.  Block seems to occur more often than dodge and the two of them together will save you a lot of damage.  Block raises fairly quickly and should be maxed out within a level or two.  This is a great skill, so train it as soon as possible.

<b>Double Attack:</b>  This skill gives you a chance of hitting twice per round with each fist.  In theory you should hit 4 times per round but you won't see this happening a lot until 30th.  From 15th on you'll average about 2.5 punches per round and this average will slowly increase as you rise in level until you hit 4 times every round.  At 35th, a monk friend was hitting for up to 35 points of damage 4 times per round on a consistent basis.  Not bad, eh?

<b>Feign Death: </b> This skill is a real life saver once you get it maxed out and will save your life many times.  Basically when you hit this button you make a death throe and fall to the ground pretending to be dead.  Once you get the skill maxed out it will fool many monsters and save your life or save you from unnecessary damage.  The way to tell if it works is whether you see a message "You have fallen to the ground."  If you see this message, your attempt has failed and you'd better think of something else quick.  If you don't see the message, then you've succeeded in your attempt.  Some red monsters aren't fooled even when you succeed so it's not foolproof.  It also doesn't work on players since they can still see your life bar and still attack.  Personally I think it should have a chance of working against players and higher rate of fooling red monsters once you've mastered the skill.  But that's just me.  
<P>
There are certain points of etiquette you should observe with feign death.  First, when you're trying to raise the skill you should probably do it in a secluded spot since it can be very annoying for others to listen to over and over again.  Second, once you have mastered it, try not to compromise others with the ability.  If you're being run down by a train of monsters and feign death next to another party of players who are subsequently killed, you'll probably have made some new enemies.  So try to pull the monster away from others if at all possible.

<b>Eagle Strike:</b>  Tiger claw starts to seem weak as you get to 18th and 19th level and Eagle Strike is the cure to this problem.  It's another special punch and still has the high refresh rate of Tiger Claw.  But once this skill is maxed out you'll start hitting for upwards of 25 points of damage which is a nice upgrade to your regular attacks.  It won't be as painful to raise as Tiger Claw since you'll be grouping at this point but it will take about two levels to max this skill.

<b>Dragon Punch: </b> Just when you start to get comfortable with Eagle Strike you get your next special attack upgrade.  Dragon Punch is yet another special punch that has the same refresh rate but hits for 35 points of damage once it's maxed out.

<b>Disarm:</b>  It sounds like a nice skill but really isn't very useful.  First, if you disarm a monster, it still seems to hit for the same damage even without it's weapon.  Second, it doesn't work on other players.  And third, it doesn't work on monsters using magical weapons.  This skill raises on its own like block and dodge and should max within a level or two.  You should still train it immediately so it starts rising though.

<b>Flying Kick:</b>  This is the special move you've worked so hard for.   Few things in the game look quite as cool as a monk executing his amazing flying kick.  And the damage, o the damage it does.  This special attack has the same refresh rate as kick and round kick but does loads of damage.  You'll start off doing 50 or so damage with it and it will continue to rise until 50th.  At level 42, a monk told me it was hitting for close to 100 damage.

<b>Riposte:</b>  This causes you to completely avoid a blow that otherwise would have done you damage much like block and dodge.  But the added bonus is that you do additional damage to them in the process.  Basically, it's dodge and an additional attack that round.  A very nice skill to have.
