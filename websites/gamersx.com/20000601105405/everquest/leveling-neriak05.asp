<P>
Again you have different options.  If you're soloing, I'd recommend hunting lionesses and giant scarabs in E. Commons.  You can still get good experience for killing puma and skeletons at 8th.  If you're one of the pet classes, I'd also recommend hunting asp on the south side of E. Commons.  They give great experience and giant snake fangs sell for about 4 gold.  At levels 9 and 10 you can solo lions that con white or blue.  A pet class can even take a yellow young kodiak.  If you're grouping you have more options available to you.  If you want to do the ho hum levelling routine you can hunt lions and kodiaks in E. Commons until you're 11th.  Or you can take your group to North Ro where new adventures and challenges await you.  In North Ro you can hunt mummies, madmen, dune tarantula and, at the higher levels, dervish cutthroats.  If you are hunting in N. Ro, I'd recommend having a cleric in your group to deal with the poison and disease that many of the monsters give.  If you happen to be a cleric then you'll be in high demand there (clerics usually are).  
<P>
You can also try the two orc camps in E. Commons if you like your action to be fast paced.  Or you can also try the orc and dervish camps along to northern edge of W. Commons.  Taking the dervish and orc camps will be a real challenge and will help you develop good grouping skills because you'll be fighting three to five opponents simultaneously depending on which camp you choose.  You need to learn how to focus on the same monster using the /assist command and how to keep people healed when they need it and how to taunt monsters off of casters or tanks who are low on health.  These skills will prove invaluable as you start hunting in dungeons at higher levels.  To start off, you should try the orc camp in the northwest corner of the zone.  It's right by the zone border so you can easily escape if things start to go against you and you'll only be fighting 3 orcs at a time.  The orc camp closer to the entrance to nektulos is much more dangerous since you'll be fighting 4 or 5 at a time and should only be attempted when your group is 10-12.  I'd suggest doing the camps for a while before trying your luck in  Befallen so you will be a more seasoned veteran when it comes to combat against multiple monsters.  Which leads me to the next option.
<P>
If you're in a large group and really want to test your abilities, you might want to try your first dungeon.  Befallen is a good place to start because it is easily accessible and has about the right level of monsters for these levels.  The entrance to Befallen is a large cavern found along the southern border of W. Commons.  Once inside you'll want to familiarize yourself with the entrance, because you'll probably find yourself running back to it regularly with several monsters in hot pursuit.  You'll find that hunting in dungeons is a lot more dangerous and unpredictable than hunting in the outdoors.  But you'll also find the challenge to be more fun and much more rewarding since the loot you find in dungeons is much better than what you find outside.
<P>
There are several key points to remember when hunting in dungeons.  The first is that the dungeon side of the zone border is probably the most dangerous place to be in the whole place.  You'll have several parties in a dungeon at any given time, some of which are very high level and fighting very nasty monsters.  Even high level parties pull stuff they can't handle and when the fight turns against them, they run for the zone border like everyone else does.  The problem is that when they go through the zone border, the monsters that were chasing them will target anything that happens to be nearby.  A  couple of level 22 elf skeletons will make very short work of a level 9-11 group, especially if they're resting from a large fight.  So never rest on the dungeon side of the zone border unless you are tough enough to deal with most monsters in the dungeon.  At level 10-12 this does not mean you.  If you need to rest and heal in a bad way, do it on the W. Commons side of the border.
<P>
The best way to hunt is to find a fairly quiet nook off the beaten path to the zone border (remember that not only is the dungeon zone border a dangerous place to rest, but also the main path to the zone border) and lure the desired monsters to your spot.  One member of the party goes to a spot where monsters of the appropiate level spawn and draws them to where the rest of the party is.  The best lurers have a ranged attack so they get a good head start on the monsters they're luring, they are also usually one of the higher levelled members of the group who is more familiar with the dungeon and can take more punishment.  The person who lures is often the group leader because they have the greatest responsibility in the group.  It's their job to find a group of monsters, appraise them as something the group will be able to handle and to bring them to the group.  It's also his or her job to warn the group that monsters are incoming and, if possible, what monsters and how many.  There will be times that the lurer will pull a monster or monsters that the group cannot handle.  If this is the case, the lurer has to lead them to the zone border rather than to the group.  Luring is a dicey occupation and the party's lurer should be given extra consideration when choice items of loot are found.  You yourself should not attempt to lure until you've spent a good amount of time in the dungeon and are fairly familiar with the layout and the monsters that are in it.
<P>
The final point to remember about fighting in dungeons are to communicate well and use the team concepts you learned while fighting the dervish and orc camps.  Healers need to keep an eye on everyone's life bar and heal people who are in trouble.  When you are the group's main healer, let everyone know the second you run out of mana so they know that the hitpoints they have are all they have left.  Melee types need to use their taunting skill to keep the monsters hitting them instead of the casters.  It it imperative that you keep monsters off of your healer or healers.  Nothing will get group members killed quicker than having one or two monsters interrupting the cleric's or shaman's attempts to heal.  Casters need to concentrate on rooting and finishing off weakened monsters that attempt to escape so they don't bring others.  They also need to mix in a few casts to soften a monster up to make it easier for the melee types.  Just be sure not cast too much or too soon or the monster will fixate on you.  If a monster does fixate on you and you're a caster, don't panic and run.  Tell the group that one is on you and have one of the warriors taunt it off you, or other casters focus their attacks on it to kill it quickly.  Running just assures that they won't get the monster off of you and group members may die because they continue fighting thinking they can count on you to do your part.  To sum up, communication and paying attention to the details of your class's role are the keys to surviving in a dungeon and gaining consistent experience.  
<P>
Now that you've had the crash course in hunting dungeons, you're ready to start hunting in Befallen.  Newer groups often camp out in the large foyer near the entrance and this is probably where you should start out.  The door to the left will be locked.  The key will randomly appear on one of the necromancer acolytes that spawn behind the door to the right.  You should probably start off pulling stuff from behind the door to the right.  Pull it into the foyer so you can be sure other monsters won't spawn when you're unprepared to deal with them.  If you do get the key to the door on the left, you may want to try pulling some large skeletons and mummies from there.  If you do, have the person with the key hold the door open for the lurer or make sure the lurer has the key.  I wouldn't recommend locating yourself on the other side of the door until you are higher level since fleeing party members can easily be trapped on the other side of the door if things go wrong.  Necromancer apprentices, skeletons, large skeletons and even greater skeletons should be quite manageable for your group.  Ghouls will be manageable if you have a lot of casters or you have melee characters who can strike magically.  Fight and rest on the right side of the room because higher level parties will occasionally come fleeing out of the door to the left with high level monsters in pursuit.  If you ever hear someone shout or /ooc "train headed to zone," be very sure to pull any monsters you're fighting as far to the right as possible.  If the stuff you're pulling starts to become routine and bores you, try moving deeper into the dungeon; just be mindful of the stuff that is spawning behind you.

While these are not the only paths to 13th, they are the easier and more well-travelled paths and should give you a good introduction to the world of Eastern Antonica.  My main advice would be to try and meet new people whenever you get the chance.  The more friends and acquaintances you have on the server, the more fun you will have.  The best way to do this is to help people whenever you have the chance.  Someone can't find the bank?  Show them where it is.  Someone's in serious trouble with a monster they're fighting?  Help them (be sure to ask first so they won't think you're stealing their kill).  What goes around eventually does come around.  This goes for a lack of consideration as well.  Kill stealing will make you many enemies fast.  So does mindless player killing.  Following the golden rule will make life more pleasant for you and everyone else on the server.  Please observe it.
