<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Kinter:
[B]I have been on all possible receiving ends of this one, as I'm sure you all have.

I have died while people watched.  Frustrating as hell, especially if you are shouting for help and you KNOW they are just waiting for their friends to get back from the inn, because you hear them talking casually while you die.

I have had mobs that I could easily handle stolen from me.  Party of 6 pulls two blue dark bone skeletons in Unrest, and the neighbors nab one of them, saying they "thought we couldn't handle it" even though we had already killed a barbed and a carrion ghoul while they watched.

I have watched people die without helping.  This is usually to people that I KNOW deserve it, or with mobs I couldn't possibly handle, or when we were already in over our heads, or when the group was oom / injured badly.  I don't feel an obligation to die trying to save a stranger's life, especially if the stranger SHOULD have known better, or deserves to die once or twice for crimes of the past.

I have saved a life and been accused of KSing.  Once, while we fought a 20ish mob, some child accidentally lost his 12th level mob in our pile of trash.  We killed it in the heat of the battle, and he proceeded to spend 15 MINUTES calling his 35th level friend over and having his friend threaten to steal all our kills and punish us endlessly, while we apologized and said, basically, "what could we possibly gain from this?  Can't you see it was an accident, moron?"

My favorite, though, was when a group got in WAY over their head, and then started yelling for help.  We came over, healed them, saved their lives, and killed one of their particularly nasty mobs.  They then proceeded to complain up a blue streak about how we stole their kills.

You just can't please some people.[/B][/QUOTE]

As the mobs passed me they turned there attack onto me while 4 other characters sat there and watched my life dwindle down to a thread.<BR>Now I dont know if I'm taking this too far but the thing that really got me was that two of the watchers were Barbarian (as I am), but instead of helping a fellow brother in crisis they sat and watched me die. Then to proceed to kill all the mobs after I died to get the experience. Maybe I'm over reacting but that really nerved me.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yldal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree, I hate watchers too... one of the worst feelings to have after dying is that you know the people around you could have helped, but didn't.<P>Of course, they might have the excuse for not seeing or hearing you, but when you run up to the Orc Hill with two cents hacking on you and have hopes that the ten people there will save you, and then they all ignore you and watch you die even though you use the /yell and say "Help me please!", I refuse to believe the just didnt notice...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">BMFRAY</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I dont know..I guess it all comes down to the point that they cant handle the mob themselves so lets take it out when it's drained of life and we know we'll get the exp. Either that or they're too high level to care about people who are in trouble. But I guess I never learn my lesson because I keep helping people when they are in trouble.Guess thats just the nature in me...I guess I'll never learn hehe.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">roflmao</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hahahahaha but you'da bitched your head off if they would have just come up and taken the kill.

And they don't have to ask.  I have enough sence to see when someone is in trouble.  <P>For example the other day in WC I saw a lower level barbarian who attacked one wisp and got attacked by a second that they couldnt handle.  She ran over to the gaurds who ignored her, and most of the other people around just watched.  I on the other hand, proceded to heal her with bind untill she could finish the first one and get exp, and then killed the second one for her.  <P>I can't belive the way some people act.  How would you feel if some one let you die.  The only time I would ever let someone die is if I was busy keeping my party alive.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fragged</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Savage,<P>As a general rule of thumb, people won't help without someone asking.

Personally, depending on what character you are playing (exp A SHAMAN or Cleric) I dont give a damn if they yell at me and accuse me of ksing..It's part of my role as a cleric or shaman to make sure that no one dies while I am around, It's all part of roleplaying your character. Btw, the group that let me die were the same race as me, and if you do play any rpg then you really know that "to each his own". That's the way I look at it. I have a Barbarian Shaman, and If I saw any barbarian getting his ass kicked the I would be there in a heartbeat. In EQ each race is considered a part of a whole family and shouldnt stand by while the other (same race) is getting whacked down. And if I see that they have plentiful health then I will simply inquire if they need any assistance.<P>Guidian &lt;Crimson Horde&gt; Bertoxx</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Arryen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Whenever I see someone getting beat up bad, I dont wait for them to ask for helk, I ask them if they want any help. As Im a wizard, I cant heal, so I generally root the MOB then tell them to back up to get healing from someone else (hopefully)or run, and if they run Ill finish the MOB. I have been playing foe about 6 months now and have been acused of KS only once and this was due to a major lag problem on the day.<P>BTW, My guild will go out of its way to help anyone in need.
