<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I dunno ,  maybe its just me but why would anyone enjoy agame in which they hang 
around for hours , doing sod all  , waiting for a monster to appear only for someone to dive in there and steal it from them ?
It would be better in my opinion to not bother camping to start off with.
It may seem a great idea spending days trying to get ghoulbane , but what is the point? It turns the whole game into a nightmare . The kill stealing will never be eliminated , verrant does nothing to discourage it , in fact they take stronger action against the vigilantes and unless you are a wizard / enchanter / Mage you cant compete with them , so dont bother . There are loads of uncamped areas in the game so go there and enjoy the game instead of getting into conflicts with crowded groups all grabbing the same items .
Most of them are not that great anyway . People boast about having this sword and its great because it is 2points faster than a combine longsword . Well big deal . Most of these items do not enhance playing pleasure and dont make the game that much easier .
The other day my Ranger (20th level) was grouped with a Female dark elf warrior . 
She had a cracked darkwood shield , PGT and fantastic armour etc . She could tank only a little better that I could , got hit more often and got just a butchered ad me too .
I spoke to her and she said that it had taken her 3 weeks to get the PGT .
I replied that in 3 weeks she could have made 3 levels , 500 platinum and had a whale of a time exploring / adventuring etc and bought a weapon as good if not better than that with the profits . Certain zones have been pretty much ruined by overkeen campers . 
Crushbone and HH are rediculous zones , and the friuts of the camping are moderate at best . Dragoon Dirk and SBH are decent weapons but I would not bother camping there for weeks with a view to getting them , its sad and dull.
Maybe im missing the point and its mad twinkers that camp these places . On Povar last week a Ranger friend of mine told me that he had sold a bloodstained tunic to a twinker for 1000 plat . Get that ? 1000 plat . Talk about lower the value of money in the game .
As for me , I dont think that the game revolves around grabbing ever more powerful items as far as I can see it never makes you invulnerable . I see people of all levels struggling ( a testament to the difficulty curve in the game) .
