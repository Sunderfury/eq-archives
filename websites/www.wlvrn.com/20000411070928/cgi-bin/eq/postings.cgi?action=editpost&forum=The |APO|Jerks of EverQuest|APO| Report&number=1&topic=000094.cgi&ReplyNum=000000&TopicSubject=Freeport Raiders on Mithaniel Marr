<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">My apologies for the length of this post.  This past Saturday night, I was hunting Slavers and Legionairres over in the orc village of Crushbone and ran across an interesting duo of fellows that were doing what I would consider unscrupulous and appalling.  See if you agree.  Your answer will depend on whether you power-game or role-play.

A dwarf named Doriz and a companion of his (whose name escapes me now) came running into the Slaver cave and started killing an elven slave.  My character's initial reaction was one of shock, and if Mithaniel Marr were PvP, he would have been lacerated on the spot by my swords before he'd known what hit him.  After I saw him continuing to systematically take out the rest of the dwarven and elven slaves, I asked him (via /shout, mind you) why he was killing all the slaves.

His response was something to the effect of 'Why not?  They don't hurt faction.'

I, of course, responded by saying that he was making it harder for others (including myself) to turn in keys to the slaves and get their xp and faction reward.  Several others rebuked him for his actions and requested in different ways that he desist.  He never responded, but shortly after, I saw him at it again.  I did, in fact, hang around much longer in the orc village than I had originally intended, just to see that he had discontinued his activities.  He had not.

I did another /shout, saying 'STILL killing helpless slaves I see, Doriz?'

We then had an entire conversation in /shout, with several others joining in on the chat, expressing their indignation as well.  To summarize, he was killing them for easy experience, with what he considered to be no penalties.  He also had some misconception that he could kill slaves for keys, rather than slavers.  The fact that he was killing all slaves, not just elven, made it obvious that he was not paying attention to even the least of role-playing ethics.  If he'd been killing dwarven bandits, I'd not have given the situation any thought, but...

He even went so far as to say 'I'm level 7.  What else can I kill here?'  ...which got several reaponses from others in Crushbone, most along the same lines, saying that he was so wimpy, he had to beat up slaves.  I simply told him 'How about Centurions, like all the rest of us did?'

Even after that, to my knowledge, he stayed and continued.  I grew fed up of the spectacle and went elsewhere.  My question is one of ethics and power-gaming versus role-playing.  He and his companion were both members of a guild called Freeport Raiders.  If there are a large group of people within that guild, are they aware of Doriz's actions, and do they condone them?  If so, Freeport Raiders will have a VERY bad name for themselves in a relatively short period of time.  Or was that their intention all along?

To add to the story, I saw Doriz for the first time at the docks in Freeport earlier that day... killing the elven fisherwoman there.  He was, of course, killed by a nearby city guard for his actions.</TEXTAREA>
