I mean WTF? Not only can he not forgive the ppl on the game for typing errors, but hes b*tch*n' about the errors on ppl's responses too! Ok someone needs to tell this guy to CHILL OUT! This is supposed to be a site for those complaints on actual jerks. Not for complaints on those who failed third grade English. Does he and all my professors hang out at the grammar bar or something? When he picks up women does he say, 'hey baby, before I buy you a drink can you write this line down in a sentence for me, because if you cant spell, it'll never work out.' God, I hope I didnt make any mistakes writing this, but if I did, WHO CARES?! Life goes on. Relax and live a little!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Houngan MindPrey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree, but thats the facts of life. There will always be ass-holes who think their better than others; who like to pick and look for the misstakes others make to cover their own short commings. this helps them feel superior over poor worthless souls in their eyes. The best thing to do, is just say "what a jerk!" and walk away. Their life will be riddled with self inflicked pain and trouble do to their own lack of compasion etc...if anything feel pity for them they; think they are all perfect yet stray farther from the path than their blind eyes shall ever know.<BR>&gt;<BR>and this young lad reminds me of another lost soul, who thought his shit didnt stink either...i think it was ROFLMOA if i remember correctly.<BR>Houngan MindPrey (Veeshan)<BR>Lords Of Chaos</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Vulkan Everheart</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aye.. he/she might be a perfect typer, but it sure seems he/she doesnt know anything about people skills.. hehe.. good manners is more important in the big scheme called life.

By saying that someone is a jerk for being able to spell better than you is a poor argument.<BR>And its not a case of ramming it down anyones throat either.Some people prefer the language to better spoken and written than others.<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mavik</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I just want to say that I am one of those people who do not know how to spell.
