Pardon my language, but these stupid F*CKING programmers got me killed about a dozen times because they didn't even announce the change on the message of the day, so when I was bound in the middle of Kithicor, I died about every five seconds trying to make it to the zone.  I would reappear and then be killed immediately.<P>Bastards.<P>------------------<BR>Friedland<BR>Sixth Circle <BR>21st Order Magician<BR>World of Veeshan<P>True beauty is not in the eye of the beholder, but in the heart of the beautiful.<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dakwir</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ok, first lets look at this from a player standpoint.<P>1. People don't like overcrowding, and are starting to seriously complain about this.<P>2. Players are attaining higher levels as the servers age, and are looking for better exp, and equipment.<P>Now, let's look at this from Verant's perspective.<P>1. They made this game to make money. Sure, it is fun for us to play, but their title says it all "You are in our world now."<P>2. As a business that likes to make money, you do not want your clientel to leave.<P>Now that we understand these points, let's look at the games high level areas themselves.<P>Dungeon: Solusek B - High level dungeon, with nice loots, and great exp for the 35+ crowd.<P>Problem: Only about 1/3 of the zone is doable by a single group. For the Fire Giant/Nagafen area, you need to have 3-6 groups of level 40+ people to even think about doing anything in this area. For the Erffeeti area, you need at least 2 groups of 40+, and only go in with 2 groups if you have a high level enchanter as the Imps, and Lava Guardians are really nasty. When you start getting places that require multiple groups, you get one or two groups getting the exp, and the others are just along for the ride/items. Everyone likes to get exp don't they?<P>Dungeon: Lower Guk - Absolutely fabulous dungeon. Very big, very well done, and great items/exp to be had for every class.<P>Problem: Overcrowding is horrid in this zone. Go there sometime, and do a /shout "camp check", and you will find that everything but the Guk King is camped on a regular basis. It is so bad anymore, that you can almost run through the zone without invis, or invis vs undead as the spawn can't keep up with the people in there.<P>Dungeon: Kedge Keep - Never been there, but I have heard a lot of good things about this place from friends.<P>Problem: It is an underwater zone, which means you have to have some form of water breathing. Not that big of a problem, but it still scares people. Also, from everything that I heard, you need multiple groups to do this dungeon, which you can read above on the problems this brings.<P>Planes: PoH/PoF - Really nice loots. Really nice exp.<P>Problem: These places both require multiplae groups, as they are super hard. Also, you have to be 47+ really to get there, sure it says 46+, but if you die and loose 46.......you get the picture. Also, the multiple group thing happens.<P>Now, as to why would they do this? It is a "quick fix" if you ask me. Seems to me it is easier to take a RARELY used area, and change it's encounter tables, than it would be to redo/rebalance a already crowded area. Verant has done something similar with a "test the waters" thing like they are doing now in the past. Remember the Crafted Armor quests? Remember the referrance to them when they brought out the class specific Temple of Solusek Ro quests? See what they are doing with Splitpaw now?<P>Why should high levels have to hide in holes in the ground? Personally, I love what they did with Kithicor as we high levels now have an outdoor zone.  <IMG SRC="http://www.wlvrn.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Why should they have to put up a warning for you when there is plenty of common sense warnings in game?<P>You have entered Kithicor Forest.<P>Hrmmmm........3 high levelgroups sitting at the entrance here.<P>/who<P>Hrmmm........30+ high level people in the zone, something has to be going on here. Maybe I should ask someone what's going on?<P>Get the drift?<P>Dakwir Dreadfire level 44 Dark Elf Magician, Povar.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
