[B]Unfortunatly I know how you feel.  You really have 3 choices in a situation like that.

1) Ignore the moron, either by just chosing not to read his text, or my favorite, put him on your /ignore monk, list =).

2) If it really bothers you to ever see this language you could always turn the language filter back on to weed out the undesireable words.  /filter

3) Lets just say you did filter it and the person was still being offensive I suggest you log everything said or take a screen shot or two and report the guy.  However, be sure to ask someone to stop first, as you did with him.  We all slip from time to time.

Its people like this that make me want to play on a PVP server.[/B][/QUOTE]

She loves to watch me play EQ and is very smart . I let her move my warrior around and attack etc. While playing someone was using -uck word. She asked what word was. Iasked player to refrain please from language . His reply was I was a Queer. The player Dras a 25 Monk then trained Goblin Warriors into room I was in in highkeep feigned dead and I was killed. I'm 29 warrior I cahllenged Dras, but he logged off.  Several people who know of me and befriend me have trid to duel him , but he zones to live another day.  In life sometimes I use foul language and I am not proud of it. In EQ I strive to be more then I can be in life. I wish to keep Eq and honorable and chaste place ie. Camelot.

If it disturbs you to see that kind of language, and there is a way for you to keep from seeing it, then you should use it and not expect others to change their habits to fit with your desires.<P>There are times when foul language is perfectly appropriate (see my post under stupid programmers), such as when one wishes to express extreme frustration, excitement, or fear.  While you may not choose to use foul language in the game, there is not and should not be a rule saying that others cannot use it...especially when there is the ability for you to filter it out.<P>Anyway, yes I agree that this person was rude and callous, but if you don't want your daughter to experience language like that, perhaps you should take steps on your own to keep her from it, instead of expecting the world to change for you.<P><P>------------------<BR>Friedland<BR>Sixth Circle <BR>21st Order Magician<BR>World of Veeshan<P>True beauty is not in the eye of the beholder, but in the heart of the beautiful.<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Black Eel</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hello, Not Trying to be offensive or anything<BR>but your obviousley old enough to have children so you should be old enough to handle someone calling you a queer without resorting to "im gonna beat his ass cuz he dissed me dOoDZ! everyone uses foul language it doesnt hurt anyone. theres no reason to be a nazi and tell people how to talk.<BR>and if your daughter can be around a game with racism (faction system) and other sdensitive issues. she should be able to handle some foul language<BR>thin is people are different, not everyone looks the same, dresses the same, acts the same, or talks the same. its not that big a deal and its actually a good thing. im not saying excessive foul language is good, and im not saying its bad, its neither words are just that words. and who decided that certain words were foul?<BR>Shit means dung, Fuck means sexual intercourse. no big deal.<BR>so to wrap it up. let people be the way they are. and dont challenge people to duels unless you have good reason.<BR>live and let live</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Shao</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">First, the part where the guy trained you makes him a jerk.  That's a bannable offense at this point, but it's hard to prove.  Repeated use of profanity on public channels (e.g. shout) is also bannable.  /report it and petition if there's a real problem.<P>Second, a look at the EQ box indicates that it's rated as:<P>TEEN<BR>Animated Blood & Gore<BR>Animated Violence<BR>Suggestive Themes<P>That's roughly equivalent to a PG-13 Movie.  If you want to take your 4-year-old into a PG-13 Movie, that's your business, but this game was NOT written for young children.  Don't be shocked if there's some profanity, and don't be shocked if people tell you to get lost when you ask them to tone down their language.<P>And finally, use the language filter.. that's what it's for.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
