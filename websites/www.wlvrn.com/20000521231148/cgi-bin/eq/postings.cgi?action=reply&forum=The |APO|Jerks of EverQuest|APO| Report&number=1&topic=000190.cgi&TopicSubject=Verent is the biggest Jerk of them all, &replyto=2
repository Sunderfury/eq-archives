<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Maehdros:
[B]I have to agree with Aggy here. I hate camping and am having a great time playing for fun and exploring and seeing new things. Why just last night I grouped with 3 people and we hunted Oasis ( we are all in our teens level wise) We had a blast even when we got overwhelmed by orcs and all died it was still alot of fun. I have in my short Life as a ranger(15th level)  hunted in  Upper Guk,Innouthule swamp, the Ro desert zones, Oasis, both Commons, Befallen, Unrest, Dagnors cauldron, Butcherblock, Crushbone, Steamfont and 
Lesser Faydark. I have hade more fun in those places that have the fewest campers. Crushbone and Unrest being the worst by far. 
My philosophy has always been go to a place and hang for a short time if it is crowded or camped move on.....I play this game to have fun.  Do I like to up levels sure, have nice equipment sure..but I don't need to have the very best sword and the very best armor and the very best so and so and on and on and on........If it gets to the point where I can't find a place to hunt with out having idiots steal all my kills or have to enter some stupid lottery(sheesh)then I will buy a different game.

It turns the whole game into a nightmare . The kill stealing will never be eliminated , verrant does nothing to discourage it , in fact they take stronger action against the vigilantes and unless you are a wizard / enchanter / Mage you cant compete with them , so dont bother . There are loads of uncamped areas in the game so go there and enjoy the game instead of getting into conflicts with crowded groups all grabbing the same items .<BR>Most of them are not that great anyway . People boast about having this sword and its great because it is 2points faster than a combine longsword . Well big deal . Most of these items do not enhance playing pleasure and dont make the game that much easier .<BR>The other day my Ranger (20th level) was grouped with a Female dark elf warrior . <BR>She had a cracked darkwood shield , PGT and fantastic armour etc . She could tank only a little better that I could , got hit more often and got just a butchered ad me too .<BR>I spoke to her and she said that it had taken her 3 weeks to get the PGT .<BR>I replied that in 3 weeks she could have made 3 levels , 500 platinum and had a whale of a time exploring / adventuring etc and bought a weapon as good if not better than that with the profits . Certain zones have been pretty much ruined by overkeen campers . <BR>Crushbone and HH are rediculous zones , and the friuts of the camping are moderate at best . Dragoon Dirk and SBH are decent weapons but I would not bother camping there for weeks with a view to getting them , its sad and dull.<BR>Maybe im missing the point and its mad twinkers that camp these places . On Povar last week a Ranger friend of mine told me that he had sold a bloodstained tunic to a twinker for 1000 plat . Get that ? 1000 plat . Talk about lower the value of money in the game .<BR>As for me , I dont think that the game revolves around grabbing ever more powerful items as far as I can see it never makes you invulnerable . I see people of all levels struggling ( a testament to the difficulty curve in the game) .<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Maehdros</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have to agree with Aggy here.
