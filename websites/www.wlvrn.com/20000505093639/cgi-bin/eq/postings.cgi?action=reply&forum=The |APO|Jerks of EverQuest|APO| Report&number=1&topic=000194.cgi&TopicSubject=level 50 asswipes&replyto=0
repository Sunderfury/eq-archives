[B]Know if you don't know me, lets say it takes alot to make me mad.
 But.......... we are camping the infamouse "jboots" there are these two level 50 (wiz & cleric) bombing driz to hell and back!! we ask if we can share.They pretend "we speakie no english we Japanese", Well, evertime Drez. had boots one would log out and this other charecter would log in to get the boots!! Man what is up with that??!!So we started trying to outbomb them (like we had a chance) then we would just sit there and keep clicking on the corpse till we could loot or they did!! needless to say we got one pair of boots in 14 hours!I think all of their lower level guys have boots now.They are some truely smart people to think of this but where is the fun of getting the items for yourself??I wonder if this was some of the (eeer) want say the guilds name who has made it a living getting accounts built up with a level 50 charecter and cool items and then sells it on ebay!!I didn't report them but next time i will!
(imho)someone who does this is pretty smart and making a buck, but don't ruin it for other!!by owning the camp!!but the low life who buys this super game c/d with its premaid god charecter.Is the true losser, where is the fun in exploring and finding that cool item(s).I seen bid of 4500 bucks for a EQ cd with a level 50 wiz. and he had lots of cool stuff from fear.But its not your name!you didn't meet and get to know these people up around your level!as you grow from level to level!
The people that buy these c/d's are the true jerks of EQ and some sad lazy people, be like buying a paint by numbers kit and pay someone $1,000 to paint it;then hang it on the wall..."look what i painted all by myself"...loser.
