<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I have been on all possible receiving ends of this one, as I'm sure you all have.

I have died while people watched.  Frustrating as hell, especially if you are shouting for help and you KNOW they are just waiting for their friends to get back from the inn, because you hear them talking casually while you die.

I have had mobs that I could easily handle stolen from me.  Party of 6 pulls two blue dark bone skeletons in Unrest, and the neighbors nab one of them, saying they "thought we couldn't handle it" even though we had already killed a barbed and a carrion ghoul while they watched.

I have watched people die without helping.  This is usually to people that I KNOW deserve it, or with mobs I couldn't possibly handle, or when we were already in over our heads, or when the group was oom / injured badly.  I don't feel an obligation to die trying to save a stranger's life, especially if the stranger SHOULD have known better, or deserves to die once or twice for crimes of the past.

I have saved a life and been accused of KSing.  Once, while we fought a 20ish mob, some child accidentally lost his 12th level mob in our pile of trash.  We killed it in the heat of the battle, and he proceeded to spend 15 MINUTES calling his 35th level friend over and having his friend threaten to steal all our kills and punish us endlessly, while we apologized and said, basically, "what could we possibly gain from this?  Can't you see it was an accident, moron?"

My favorite, though, was when a group got in WAY over their head, and then started yelling for help.  We came over, healed them, saved their lives, and killed one of their particularly nasty mobs.  They then proceeded to complain up a blue streak about how we stole their kills.

You just can't please some people.</TEXTAREA>
