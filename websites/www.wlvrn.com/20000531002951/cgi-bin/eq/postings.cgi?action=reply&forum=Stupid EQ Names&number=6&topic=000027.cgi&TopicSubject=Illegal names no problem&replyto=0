<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Name Buster:
[B]Well if your reading this board i will go out on a limb and assume you've seen some pretty silly names and want to rant about them. 

Well i say why rant, why not just get rid of the name? thats right get rid of it. When ever i see a name that i feel slipped thru the name filter, I just petition a GM(guide)


i say illegal name then give the name and why i feel it shouldnt pass. then about 15 to 20 later a guild will ask me about it and say they will submit it to a GM if they also feel it doesnt belong.

Now you may think that they are just humoring me but i tell you they are not. THis is how i know,  I was walking thru my home town of Kaladim and saw a guide standing there. And said 'hi' he said hi back and then thanked me for helping with names. I said i hoped they didnt mind me taking up their time, he replied that they love it when ppl report names because it saves them alot of work. I told him i would keep up the good work. 

Oh also know that it does work too, ive seen about 4 of the ppl ive reported get their names changed.

People who don't know Wargs from Swanmay shouldn't even be aloud on the same servers as people who do. I have a job, and go to school, and I have other things to do. However, if I get involded in an RPG I have thou courtesy of at least understanding the multiverse. This goes beyond just names. A dwarf sould not reply to the phrase "Ay laddie" "Whazzup!".

Control.... Fist.... of.... Death....<P>Ok, so the flame board is that way. But this is ridiculous! What are you? The RP police? Should every poor bastard who goes out and buys the game be forced to read 3 or 4 complete series of fantasy books, play pen and paper RPG's 4 hours each night when they come home from work or school, and submit to an extended fantasy universe knowledge test just so they won't ANNOY you when they talk? In case you forgot, this game is on sale to the general public. To many, this is their first introduction into the fantasy universe. Cut them a little slack. In fact, I don't remember a single "thee" or "thou" coming from an NPC anywhere in the game, so if the developers don't think it's necessary, than why should you?<P>The only thing you should concern yourself with is the improper use of channels and blatantly improper names. Don't force everyone to RP and don't berate the attempts of others to RP a different way. IMHO the dwarf that responds, "Aya laddie," is still RP'ing. It's just their way of imagining what a dwarf would say.<P>Take the time and help these people out a little instead of slamming them. Show them how to properly roleplay if you must. Rather than berate them for bringing down your enjoyment, show them how better to enjoy it themselves. And don't get mad at the ones who don't want to play like you do. That's just plain being a snob.<P>If you don't like it, ignore it.
