Maybe it shows what that person really likes in the real world.If i was a G.M. and seen this name he would get a message..."You have been summoned by the gods"... and ask him to quickly choose another name before i choose for him. That is one that gets(maybe) into the realms of sexual and faul. I bet a G.M. will change it in time a buddy had a name of hungsolong and he loved it.He made it to level 12 then got summoned by the gods and now is known by a new name (hehehe) he was very pissed but oh well.

This only lasted for about one month, and then WOTC kindly clarified the issue... Amusing while it lasted, though.<P>------------------<BR>Dot.
