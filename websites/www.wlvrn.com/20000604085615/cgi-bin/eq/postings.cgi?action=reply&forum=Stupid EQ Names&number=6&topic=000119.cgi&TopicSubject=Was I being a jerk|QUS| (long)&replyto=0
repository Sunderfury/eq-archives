<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Grizben:
[B]Hi,

Yesterday I saw somebody with a REALLY stupid name while playing EQ. I will not reveal the person's identity, but let's just say it was someone with an obviously stupid first name and an equally stupid last name.

Now what really annoyed me was that this person had his roleplay switch on. So, since we were both waiting for the boat on the Freeport docks, I started chatting with him to kill time.

I asked him in-character (with /say) about his name. Since we are of the same race, I said stuff like "hmmm, &lt;last name&gt;, that doesn't sound familiar. Are you really from my town? Where are you from?"

That person never answered me. Not a single time. For a person who is supposedly /roleplaying, he did a very poor job.

Then, when we got on the boat, I actually told him (in /tell) that I thought his name was really stupid. I asked him if the GM's had said anything about it. The person briefly answered me that yes, the GMs were annoyed/amused at it, but had let the name pass.

Then I asked him "if it bothers you that I am telling you all this, let me know." He answered "I am officially telling you that this is annoying me". Then I answered: "I'm sorry. I will not mention it again." And I didn't.

When the boat got to Kaladim we each went our own way. About 2 hours later, as I was about to log out, some stranger /tells me "You made a lot of enemies tonight." For a moment I was perplexed, then asked him "oh, is that about the incident with person xxx?" Being normally a really polite person, I figured that was the only possible reason why I would've made enemies.

Well it turns out that was indeed the reason. The guy in question (not the one I made fun of, he never talked to me again, this was some total stranger whom I'd never talked to before - one of his guildmates) told me "You better watch your back." and "My guild and I are going to make sure you have a very bad time on this server."

I was struck speechless for a moment. My first thought was of course "Thank god this is not a PvP server ;-)" and the second one was, "wow, some people are really touchy." I was really surprised at the animosity I felt in that person's messages. Because the ones I had sent to the stupidly-named person had been in good humor and not hostile at all. And I did ask him after a few minutes, "if this bothers you, I will stop." And I stopped.

My reasoning is that, when someone creates a name with an obviously stupid name (like, for example, "Mother F'Ucker"), it is their right. But I don't understand why it hurts them personally when someone makes fun of their name. I mean, it IS a stupid name, they chose a stupid name on purpose, so why are they so touchy about it?

If I'd used rude language, I would understand. But I didn't, and most of my remarks were made in character.

I thought that someone with the "good sense of humor" to come up with a ridiculous name would have the "good sense of humour" to be able to laugh about it. Instead of shouting curses at me in a zone where I am not even present and setting up their entire guild against me.

So I would like to hear your comments on this. 

I wish you good travels in Norrath![/B][/QUOTE]

I have never annoyed anyone in the game because of their name before, but this one was just too much. It was simply that stupid.<P>And to clarify something, this person was around level 25 or higher (was /roleplaying, so I could only guess). As I mentioned, he had both a stupid first name and a stupid last name. If the name has stuck all the way to level 25, one can assume it will stay there until the end.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Houngan MindPrey ~veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">First of all sorry, i had to regester and came back to wrong page on my first post, i ment to reply to Nadiana about her "HDAWG" hang-up didnt even read this post till just now.Just try haven fun loosen up they have a reason for the name try and see what it is.<P>OHH, i agree if he is that high a level than it will be around for awhile.Come please tell us maybe we will agree, he/she may never read this post.
