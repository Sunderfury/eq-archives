Oh and as far as I know he's no longer a part of the Freeport Raiders, because he isn't /anon and he dosen't have their guild name next to his.  Ah well...[/B][/QUOTE]

This past Saturday night, I was hunting Slavers and Legionairres over in the orc village of Crushbone and ran across an interesting duo of fellows that were doing what I would consider unscrupulous and appalling.  See if you agree.  Your answer will depend on whether you power-game or role-play.<P>A dwarf named Doriz and a companion of his (whose name escapes me now) came running into the Slaver cave and started killing an elven slave.  My character's initial reaction was one of shock, and if Mithaniel Marr were PvP, he would have been lacerated on the spot by my swords before he'd known what hit him.  After I saw him continuing to systematically take out the rest of the dwarven and elven slaves, I asked him (via /shout, mind you) why he was killing all the slaves.<P>His response was something to the effect of 'Why not?  They don't hurt faction.'<P>I, of course, responded by saying that he was making it harder for others (including myself) to turn in keys to the slaves and get their xp and faction reward.  Several others rebuked him for his actions and requested in different ways that he desist.  He never responded, but shortly after, I saw him at it again.  I did, in fact, hang around much longer in the orc village than I had originally intended, just to see that he had discontinued his activities.  He had not.<P>I did another /shout, saying 'STILL killing helpless slaves I see, Doriz?'<P>We then had an entire conversation in /shout, with several others joining in on the chat, expressing their indignation as well.  To summarize, he was killing them for easy experience, with what he considered to be no penalties.  He also had some misconception that he could kill slaves for keys, rather than slavers.  The fact that he was killing all slaves, not just elven, made it obvious that he was not paying attention to even the least of role-playing ethics.  If he'd been killing dwarven bandits, I'd not have given the situation any thought, but...<P>He even went so far as to say 'I'm level 7.  What else can I kill here?'  ...which got several reaponses from others in Crushbone, most along the same lines, saying that he was so wimpy, he had to beat up slaves.  I simply told him 'How about Centurions, like all the rest of us did?'<P>Even after that, to my knowledge, he stayed and continued.  I grew fed up of the spectacle and went elsewhere.  My question is one of ethics and power-gaming versus role-playing.  He and his companion were both members of a guild called Freeport Raiders.  If there are a large group of people within that guild, are they aware of Doriz's actions, and do they condone them?  If so, Freeport Raiders will have a VERY bad name for themselves in a relatively short period of time.  Or was that their intention all along?<P>To add to the story, I saw Doriz for the first time at the docks in Freeport earlier that day... killing the elven fisherwoman there.  He was, of course, killed by a nearby city guard for his actions.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mhostlee</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Speaking of that fisherwoman... I had to kill her about six times on Fennin Ro this past Friday. I was aiding an Ogre friend of mine, Hola, to the Freeport docks with Invisibility. We missed teh boat twice, and ended up spending more than an hour and a half on the docks. If he appeared when the Lady was present, she promptly tried to slay him!<P>Being a Teir'Dal Enchanter, and Child of Innoruuk, I have no love of humans in the first place. Every time this happened, we killed her.<P>Now here is what I found shocking. There were about a dozen diferent people who came by the docks during this time. We only had one fellow who said anything about what we were doing to this Huaman, and it was a Dwarf who WANTED TO KNOW IF SHE GAVE GOOD EXPERIANCE!!! Talk about pathetic!<P>I don't know about you, but I would have cast spells at the attacker and buffs at the victem (knowing full well it does nothing), as well as verbaly lashing the attacker. Not one person does a thing about it. Not One.<BR>This is Fennin Ro!! The role playing server for crying out loud!!<P><BR>As a side note, he missed the boat twice due to getting stuck between dock and boat once, and a GM he pettitioned showed up as it arived the second time.<P>Mhostlee of Fennin Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#DEDFDF"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Anon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">LOL, this is weird, I just found this board and went back to read about all the people's that we consider "jerk's" and when I came across this one I about died, the thing is...I've grouped with Doriz more then once in Unrest [He's now a 25th Warrior], he's way beyond incompetent, can't do anything right and abandons the group when the going get's tough...and if your not grouped with him he's almost alway's shouting "TRAIN!" and just generally pissing everyone off.

They can kill slaves, guards, merchants, cobblers, or messengers.  Anyone, anything, anytime, anywhere, including when you may be in the middle of a transaction with them.<P>Perhaps they are roleplaying a sociopath that takes pleasure in the pretty patterns of splashing blood.  Perhaps they are playing a psychopath that wants everyone dead.  Perhaps they are playing an evil character that does not happen to be a part of an evil race.  Maybe they are a spy for the evil races and if they know it won't hurt their reputation, feel free to kill whatever innocents they can.  <P>Whatever their reasons are though, they have a right to do so.<P><P>------------------<BR>Friedland<BR>Sixth Circle <BR>21st Order Magician<BR>World of Veeshan<P>True beauty is not in the eye of the beholder, but in the heart of the beautiful.<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#F7F7F7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gaan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">And since the problem occurred on a carebear server, there's little I could do to stop him at the time, therefore about the most that I could do for his sociopathic behavior and complete disregard for my requests to stop slaying NPC's that are required to give the slaver keys to was to label him a jerk.<P>Voila.

There were several folks that were rather unhappy at the time about it for that reason alone.
