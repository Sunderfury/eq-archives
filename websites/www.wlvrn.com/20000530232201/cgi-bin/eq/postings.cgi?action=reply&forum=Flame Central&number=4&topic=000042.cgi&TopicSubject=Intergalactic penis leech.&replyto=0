<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Subjugator:
[B]This guy is a complete waste of flesh.  To wish cancer upon him is to praise this worthless societal disease.  This THING is a stain on humanity and a blight on the land.  I am talking about your friend and mine, Roflmao.  

I meet people like this complete bastard and all I can do is pray that there is never another one made again.  His parents clearly were either neglectful, stupid, or both as he has no concept of humanity, manners, compassion, or anything resembling values.  All he knows is making life harder for others.

Does it please you to know that there is very likely not a single soul on the entire planet that gives a rat's ass about you Roflmao?  I am sure that God loves you, but if you treat your family anything like the way you treat the people on this board, I seriously doubt they want you around.  That being said, I also doubt that you have any friends.  If you do, they aren't worth a damn and probably don't care about you either...and why should they if your family doesn't?  I know I would not.

Anyway, you weak minded snivelling ball of immaturity, crawl back into your cave and whine out your worthless existence without bothering us anymore.  

I hope I have clearly communicated what I think of you.
