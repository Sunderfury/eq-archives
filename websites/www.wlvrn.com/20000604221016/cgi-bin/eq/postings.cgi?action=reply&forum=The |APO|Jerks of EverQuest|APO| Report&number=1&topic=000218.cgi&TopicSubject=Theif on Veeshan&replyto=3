You are some stupid fucking idiots. Do you have nothing better to do then bash someones grammar. Why don't you get a fucking life. 9 times out of 10, people are trying to make a point and idiots like you all like to find the negatives in anything you possibily can.

The word you're looking for about the grammar and spelling guy is "Hippocrate". I have learned over the past year to stop whining and just accept people for what they are. I write well, but I think that insulting people and putting them down for it is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of! If you wish to do successful and have a fulfilling life, don't insult ANYONE. Do their wishes, and they will likewise do yours. I'm out, bye! (BTW I checked this entire thing for spelling and grammar errors so he can't rant on me.)</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
