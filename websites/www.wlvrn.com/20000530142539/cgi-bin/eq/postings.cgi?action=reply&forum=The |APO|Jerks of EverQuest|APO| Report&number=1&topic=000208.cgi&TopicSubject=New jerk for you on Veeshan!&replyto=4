[B]I may be wrong becouse i only played my rogue to level 18..but when you pick-pocket the mob..its like it comes from a differant loot stack a)if I would pick pocket mob while others were fighting it..if i got money they still got same money...if i got the item mob carried they didnt get the item ooops hehehehe... b) Now if I was in the group fighting and we killed a mob...if i pick-pocketed it while we were fighting...and got money...the group still got same money i just got an extra share....i have noticed that whom ever loots gets most of the money and the others get less. that is why we take loot turns in our groups. also if in a group i picked the item i would tell the group. just my opinion not sure if its right...didnt play a rogue long enough.
