We will feed upon you or bring ye into darkness. Beware of our
Blades,Arrows, Magic and our Fangs.  We will stand before you
in the blink of an eye ye shall lie dead or surrender to our
thirst or be brought to darkness.  Some of you will not get the 
offer of the dark gift for ye would not be worthy of so precious 
the gift of eternal life.  Tho it may be an undead life, 
you will exist, no matter how many times you fall in battle.
Those that will walk with us will be strong, you will be the 
damned, you shall be the masters of the night. 

You shall be
Guards of Darkness, 
and all in the darkened realm. 


Your clan shall grow and ye shall keep the traditions of 
kindred, or perish to final death.
     
If ye seek to meet with Guild Mistress Dawn Desire she will
be available via messenger/ or pidgeon carrier (ICQ - 15600430

<br> <h3> <br><center> Words of Toreador to her Childer</center>
</h3><h4><pre>In quiet you will know beauty, in beauty you will know truth, 
in truth you will know love, in love , you will know quiet. 
My children , my creations, my beautiful things
Watch and listen, listen and watch.

Use your sight, to see the truth in beauty,
Use your speed, to stay still,
Use your beauty, to know truth.

My children, my creations, gentle roses all,
I have called for your sculpture,
I have called for your pictures,
I have called for your dancing,

Beautiful children, beautiful creations
Gold is not as precious, Honey not as sweet,
Milk not as pure, like the tiger, you bite, like the hawk, 
you dive,
like the cat, you stalk,
Beautiful predators! Sweet succubi! Daring incubi! 
Taste virgin's blood and find bliss!

Find your greatest part of Joy,
Follow your greatest part of Joy,
and know that I watch you, enthralled.
my children, my creations,
my beautiful ones.
