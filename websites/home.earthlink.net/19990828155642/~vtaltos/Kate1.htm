Hi, I'm Katheryn.   Well, actually my name is Susan Katheryn Elizabeth,
 but I like Kate best.  I was born on Dec 27,1998, and have been the 
apple of Mommy and Daddy's eyes ever since.  For the most part, my main
 interests are eating, sleeping and seeing what kinds of neat noises I 
can make.  Most recently, I've just fallen in love with my neat-o 
little stuffed dragonfly with the crinkly wings. (thanks Bonnie!!!)<BR><BR>

I occasionally hear from my wonderful Grandfolks.. Great Aunts and 
Great Uncles, and friends of the family.  I like to get cards and letters
and I 'specially like it when I get email, cuz then I can read it 
on the computer with daddy and send out nifty replies right then.  <BR><BR>


My Gramma,Grampa Tom, Uncle Marc and Aunt Carrie came to visit one
 weekend and took me out to the Outback.  The smell was so good I just 
had to have daddy feed me a bottle right then.  He didn't complain too 
much about his steak getting cold.  Or at least, I didn't hear it, 
because Grampa Tom and I got into a lovely conversation, which I 
certainly look forward to continuing. <BR><BR>

Well.. that's all for now.. daddy said he'd put some pictures below, so
 you can see some special moments.  As neat new things come up, I'll 
post more stuff.  (I'm still kinda new to this HTML thing.. but then,
 I'm kinda new to everything.)<BR>
