<br>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=+1>Lord Malcolm
 MacEoghainn is a 14th C. Landowner from the Highlands of Scotland.  I 
joined the <a href="http://www.sca.org/">Society for Creative Anachronism</a>
 late in 1985 in the <a href="http://www.wlu.edu/~sca/new/">Barony 
of Black Diamond</a>, within the <a href="http://www.atlantia.sca.org/">Kingdom of Atlantia</a>. 
 At the behest of a good friend, I attended a fighting practice whereupon I was soundly thrashed
 about the head and shoulders by one Thorbrandr Olafsson.  I found myself
 quickly exhausted, bruised, aching and otherwise quite the baby seal.
 Oddly..I also found the experience exhiliarating, and several other emotions
 that the English Language does not quite have yet within its vocabulary. 
 The rest, as they say, is history.<BR> 
	<BR>I spent many long years in Black Diamond, learning various new
 skills such as <a href="scrolls.htm">Calligraphy and Illumination</a>,
 garbmaking, dance and, of course,
 the Arts Martial.  I served as both Deputy Knight Marshal and Knight Marshal,
 and also was graced with the honor of  protecting the persons of Baron Miles
 Hastings and Baroness Eorann MagUidir as Baronial Champion.   Eventually,
 <a href="photos/loric1.jpg">Syr Loric Bane</a> took note of my antics and asked me to be his squire.  I most
 happily accepted the honor and became a member of House Sasquatch, itself a
 branch of Clan Oldcastle.<BR><BR>
	Later, I met my most wondrous Lady, Tessa the Huntress, as she was
 fighting with her household,<a href="http://domainmaker.net/housebedford/"> House Bedford</a>, and other aggressive forces
 during the Assessment Battles, held in 
 Black Diamond.  Her courage, skill, and cunning as an archer was surpassed
 only by her beauty and allure, and we began a courtship that eventually led to
 her consenting to be my Wife.<BR><BR>
	Currently, we live in the<a href="http://drycas.club.cc.cmu.edu/~pengy/bmdl/">
 Barony Marche of the Debatable Lands,</a> in
 the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjc/aeth/aethelmearc.html">Sylvan Kingdom of Aethelmearc.</a>
  We have been blessed with a lovely daughter,
 Katheryn, our 3 fiercely friendly companions, Samantha, Sunshine, and Artemis,
 and our wonderful friends here in the Barony-Marche.  On my <a href="muse.html">Musings</a>
 page, you'll find out more about things I enjoy and generally what makes
 me ... me.
