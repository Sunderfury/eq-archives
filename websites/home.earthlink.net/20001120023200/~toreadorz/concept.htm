<font color="ff0000" face="New Times Roman">An Open Letter to Kindred and Prospective
Kindred of Lake Superior Shard </a>
<p>
<p>
<br><h3>This is the Concept of the Kindred of Ultima Online, those on Lake Superior
Shard:
<p></i></center></h3>
<p><h4>
<br><pre>     The Guild "Guards of Darkness" (GD) are here on Lake Superior to provide
a haven to those of the LS Shard who are Kindred or seek the dark gift.  
The characters we choose to portray are themed from, Vampire the Masquerade, 
Kindred, of the WhiteWolf RPG gaming books. Guards of Darkness, hope to develop 
the Kindred concept in the Lake Superior shard and become well known for the 
roleplaying of Kindred throughout the realm. 
     We hope to gain many good roleplayers interested in roleplaying and 
incorporate it into UO with creativity and make UO for our group fun and 
challenging.  We plan to have a hierarchy system, as in Whitewolf Books. 
We will follow the the Traditions, as in the books and portray the clans as 
close to the descriptions of each clan as possible.  We have yet to work out 
details of how to use the clan disciplines and attributes in UO gaming. 
However, we will meet and take all suggestions into account, so that we may 
develop the concept for all of us to enjoy. 
     Our beginnings will be Founders, Brother Ting and myself, Dawn Desire, being
Prince / Princess of the realm, we will have Primogens to carry out our 
orders and to watch over the cities. If perhaps more guilds are interested 
in joining and becoming rival clans, we can declare war on those guilds so 
that we may all play within a few guidelines, any place that we happen to be in UO. 
     Guidelines will be written up as the group grows. But, our beginnings will be of 
the Toreador Clan. Those wishing to become part of kindred in our group may choose 
a clan and or choose to become Toreador clan staying in the family. We will appoint 
2 Primogens of Toreador Clan in the beginning and others who join will need to 
begin their characters in 13th Generation. There will be opportunity for all 
children sired to advance generation, that will also be determined later. 
Primogens will be 8th generation.  When you advance to that rank you will be 
given a city or region to watch over.  This information is only a small part of 
what we have planned for our Roleplay Groups. 
     Those who have played Vampire Masquerade, and those who are interested 
in having fun with the Vampire / Kindred RPG will learn how much fun 
Roleplaying in UO can be.  Many of us after we have played UO for over a 
year wanted more than just being pked/ being pks/ tired of same ol same ol, 
felt that RPG gave us something new to try and gave more of a challenge to 
the world inside UO. 
     We hope you will have fun with this whole concept and if your truly 
interested in roleplay fun.. join us.
Please feel free to contact us of leave a message on the message board.
We will get back to you asap.

Sincerely,
Dawn Desire, Heart of Darkness ICQ 15600430
6th Toreador </pre>
