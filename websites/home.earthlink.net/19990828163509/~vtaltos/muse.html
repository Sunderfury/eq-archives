<h2>	So..  you're really that interested, eh?  Or did you lose
a bet?   Either way, here's a bit more info.  I went to Virginia
 Tech for a double major in Engineering and English.   That in of
 itself should explain a lot of my brain's cross-wiring.
  Of course, true to form, I don't work in either field.  
Currently I'm a LAN Administrator and am working toward my MCSE
 certification.  Long ago, before I started college, in fact, my
 Uncle told me I should go into computers.  Ok, Coach.. you were
 right…again.  I actually enjoy the field, as it's always changing
 and there's always learning to be done.   I am currently a
 consultant with Ajilon Corporation, under contract to Mellon Bank.

	In the personal areas,  I've always been fascinated by 
medieval history, specifically that of the Scots, so my progression
 into the SCA just came naturally.    Being a squire is a job I take very seriously
, and it has formed a large part of who I am over the last 8 years.  Loric
has done a great deal to teach me about more than just fighting.  
More recently, also, the members of House Bedford have added even more to 
that training and I'm most proud to count them among my friends.

Writing is another bad habit..er, I mean, hobby of mine.  Mostly,
 I prefer the short story form, and the subjects and settings tend
 to vary with my mood.  It's about the closest thing I can get to
 being artistic.  My father once told me that if I had enough
 paper, I'd try to make a whole world out of cardboard and glue.
  Well, he's not far off.  Many worlds have found existence upon
 various scraps of napkin, notebook paper and now within the guts
 of Minerva(my dear computer).  I have a link to a few of them below.
  I doubt I'll be putting many of them up here.. being the self-concious
 sort.. but it'll give you a different way to see how I think.  I'm also very interested by
 languages and the linguistic developments of different tongues
 and dialects. Some of the most fascinating classes I had at Tech involved
the development of language and the progressions of speech.

Lets not forget Photography.  I spent some great deal of time as a
manager for a Major Retail Photography chain, and did plenty of 
shooting on my own.  I've done the requisite weddings, birthdays and 
barmitzvahs.. but now I just shoot for fun.  And, now that I'm learning
more and more how this computer thing works.. well.. this just leads 
to all kinds of fun.

The Engineer in me manifests himself through my miniature
 modelling.  I've been building models since I was 8.. at least..
 that's the first one I remember doing on my own.  Of course, it
 was the Enterprise, from Star Trek.  Star Trek, Space 1999
, Battlestar Galactica, Space Academy, Star Wars.. do we see a
 theme here?  I always preferred to make the ships and try to
 make them as realistic as possible.  Now I still work with them,
 as well as doing miniatures for Warhammer and Warhammer
 40K games.

Among the copious spare hours left over from the above, that my
 dear family allows me, I also love to read.  I have to list
 Robert Heinlien as my favorite author, with Charles De Lint and
 Steven Brust battling out for a close second.  I enjoy the kinds
 of stories that challenge the perceptions of the world as we
 know it. .. those that bend the realities.. just a bit… opening
 the realms of what could be.

Below are links to subjects near and dear to my heart.  Be warned,
 I speak my mind upon these pages, and the opinions expressed
 herein are solely mine.  It is not my intention to offend or be
 disrespectful, so mind you don't take things as such.  It is
 simply the way I view life..
