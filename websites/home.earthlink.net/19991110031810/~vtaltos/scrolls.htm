</H1> </b></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">I got interested in doing scrolls almost
as quickly as I got interested in fighting.  I saw an award scroll given 
out and thought how great it looked.  I had been doing calligraphy for 
years, just for the fun of it, and didn't think that moving on to do 
scrolls would be all that different.   Uhh.. right.  <BR><BR>

Below you can see some of my past work.
Until recently, I never thought to make copies of the scrolls, but I've 
had enough requests for them... and besides, it's kinda nice to see where
you've been and what had improved.  Most of these images are shot using
a digital camera and then modified somewhat.  The details are a bit
skitchy but you get the general idea. <BR><BR>

I started out doing Baronial Award scrolls without any real guidance and 
just kinda "winged it.  I thought that the Celtic styles would be easy...
(foolish me), but kept with it and learned concepts like "balance" and 
"spacing."  Eventually, I started to do research on the whole thing, and 
found the art to be far more than it appeared.  I quickly developed a new 
respect for artist with real talent, for I found mine to be made up entirely
of little more than stubborn stick-to-it-iveness.<BR><BR>

For the most part now, I'm concentrating on later period techniques.
  I have found myself challenged greatly by the <I>Bedford Book
of Hours</I> and other late 14<sup>th</sup> to early 15<sup>th</sup> styles 
of Illumination.  This "challenge" has caused much grousing around my table
and my Lady graciously keeps her chuckling to herself while I .. um.. learn.
