</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>I would like to start this of with a big thank-you to my guildmates and brothers, Namuhtae and Galdon.  Trolli and the Corpse put nearly as much time into this quest as I did, and it was with their support in combat, searching, and companionship, that I was able to successfully complete it.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The following four Items are needed to complete this quest.  Keep in mind, all but one is no-drop, and at least 3 of the Beasties conned red to me at my level, being the 22<SUP>nd</SUP> Realm.  </P></DIR>

<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>You will take these items to Luminare in the Spell shop, at 2800, 2360.  Yes, the same shop that sells "breeze."  When you give them to her, you will get the no-drop scroll for the spell, Illusion Iksar.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now for some information about the quest itself.  The Heart of Ice and the Sabertooth mane come off of creatures in the Lake of Ill Omen.  The sabertooth Tigers will surrender the mane, and the Icebone Skellies give the heart.  These drops are fairly common, not everytime, but often enough to be not much of a difficulty.  Keep in mind, these are IKSAR skeletons, and they fight like Iksar, including the tail whip.  The Shaman powder comes off  the Froglok Nok Shamen, which can frequently be found in the north-eastern edge of Firiona Vey.  This will necessitate you carefully hunt around creatures that will con red to those in their 30s.  SoW and Invis work, but then, the Shamen are also red to a 22<SUP>nd</SUP> Realm enchanter.   Now for the "Bad" news.  The Ton Warrior totem comes from Froglog Ton Warriors which show up, when they show up, in the northern area of the Swamp of No Hope.  Galdon, Namuhtae and I hunted this zone for 4 days, at nearly 14 hours a stretch before we got this.  There are many Higher-level Enchanters that also hunt here for it, so cooperation and communication are important if you don't want to be arguing over them.  Thank you Anemomo and Alchemy for your assistance and kindnesses during MY quest.  The Ton Warriors conned either Red or Yellow to me, and hit hard, nearly 50 at a pop.  My Sisna's pet did not last long against that pounding, and even with the Trolli and the Corpse helping out, it was a fight.  I finally got the totem, and got my spell.  I wish to thank all who helped and gave encouragement when I began to despair. </P></DIR>
