<br><center><pre><h3><b>     Oh how I wish to look upon your face,
   And hold you in a tight embrace,
 To feel your neck so tenderly,
   Knowing that you love only me,
   Oh how I wish to give you this,
   That is to say A Vampires Kiss.</pre>

<br><pre><h3><b><li>Only Not  by April Raine &copy;

Protect me, 
Only not with your fists
But with your love,
Even the weakest
Can keep me from harm.

Touch me
Only not with your body
But with your eyes,
Even the slightest reflection
Is warm.

Hear me 
Only not with your ears
But with your mind,
Even the smallest sentence
Is nice.

Feel me
Only not with hands
But with your heart,
Even the softest caress
Beats twice.
