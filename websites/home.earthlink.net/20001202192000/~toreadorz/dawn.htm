<i><h3>This story was found written in a journal, I will  tell the her story in brief.
<p>
Dawn came to the realm, when she was a child.  She was a washed ashore on the banks
of the realm of Brittania.  There had been a terrible storm on the sea.  The ship was swallowed
by the sea, taking her parents with it, to a tragic watery grave. 
     <p>She was found by a girl a few years older than herself, her name was Isis de Valent.
She was taken in by Isis parents.  Isis was adopted in the same manner as she was.
Victim of shipwreck.  
<p>Mimosa her new mother, and Chadwick her new father were 
hard working folks who lived by the sea, north of Minoc.  Mimosa could bear no children
so it was a blessing for her to not only have found one child but 2  wonderful beautiful girls.  
<p>As Isis and Dawn grew up they ran in the forests and learned much from  Chadwick he
taught them of the forest, the dangers and how to protect themselves.  Mimosa was a
mage of sorts, she taught them of magical powers that would help them if they would
practice them over and over. This magic saved their lives many times. 
<p>Soon Isis became of marrying age and fell in love with a man from Yew.  Unfortunately
this man became the downfall of her beloved sister.  There was something wicked that had
befallen Isis, no magic could cure her, and the man Yurok disappeared into the night. 
Isis left the land in search of Yurok and the curse that had come over her, looking for
a cure or this man, to plea with him to remove the curse, perhaps she even sought to 
kill him for what he had done.   
<p>While Isis roamed the realm, Dawn became of age and tried hard to find her place in 
the world.. something always drew her into the night. Some sort of calling.  She heard
voices and tried to follow them. 
<p>One cold dark night the voice came to her in a library in the Court of Truth.  She had
been studying there to better herself in the guild in which she joined, the LBL. They were
Lord British's Loyalists.  A cause she felt was better than that of what she had endured.
 She had a short stay with the Guild, TG, The Guardians.  She learned much 
from them but treachery forced her to flee the guild.  Finding sanctuary with the LBL.
<p>As she sat reading a book by candlelight, a voice low and cold spoke her name.
Saying " do not be afraid, childe, it is time".  As she looked around she saw a man
in a hooded robe.. she could not make out his face but his eyes were glowing red.
As he approached her, she tensed and stood up, ready to run.  He moved with 
lightning flash speed and seized her wrists. She looked up into his face and saw
very sharp fangs and a pale white face. She screamed. He had such strength she 
could not move.  He began to kiss her lips, her cheeks and slide down to her neck
and she felt a sharp pain only for a moment then her strength began to leave her.
Her heartbeat slowed. She felt faint. He held her in his arms and licked her neck. 
He picked her up and she blacked out when she awoke she was  in a dark crypt on
a cold slab of stone.  He was there looking down on her.."My dear child Dawn, your 
beauty will take you to new heights with the new powers I give you this night."  
Dawn felt the hunger inside she thirsted but not for water.. it was an odd thirst.
He leaned down kissing her lips once more running his hands over her now partially 
clothed body. He had removed her armor and most of her clothing.  He then bit his 
own wrist, and held it to her lips she turned her head and he said to her " you must 
drink".  She did and the taste satisfied the odd thirst. She felt her strength coming 
back. She drank until he pulled away.  He looked upon her and said " My darling
Dawn you are my Heart of Darkness now and forever more". She did not understand
what had happened but she felt unbearable pain screaming and wretching into a ball 
she cried and there was no comfort.  He only spoke " The pain will not last it will 
subside, then you will know everlasting life."  He was right it did not last her body stopped writhing and
she took her last breath of mortal life.  Born unto darkness.  She then slept. <p>When
she awoke he was gone but a book lay on the table in the dungeon of death. 
A note was there on the first page, saying: this is what you need to know, I will see
you soon. Signed, Your Master and Sire. 
<p>She read the book and began to weep but her tears were of blood. She knew now
this seemed to be the curse Isis had.. Isis had wept blood. Now she understood Isis's 
need to find Yurok.  Isis did not have the book explaining the curse.  Dawn did. 
<p>Dawn found her immortality hard in the beginning, but began to adapt to it. She found
a new cause in Trinsic and joined with the Guild, FOD, Followers of Darkness to find this was
not her place, but was given her own Guild, GD Guards of Darkness, for she had learned her nature and the
power of seduction.  It is then that she found her childe Alita <a href="http://www.concentric.net/~goldn/alita1.htm"> <font color="008200">Alita's Page </a>
<font color="ff0000">and many many more.
<p>The most wonderful thing that made her immortal life worth living was finding 
her man Brother Ting, stealing him away from mortality, with her love. He became her
Nephilim, her fallen angel. They became betrothed and to be married when the time 
was right.  This is the story that she wrote in her journal. <p>Her Imortal life continues.
