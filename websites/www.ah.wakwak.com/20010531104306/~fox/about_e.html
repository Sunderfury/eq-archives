        Indeed,if you play internet game alone,you might feel friends.<br>
        Specially,no way but internet game provides a contact point with people 
        from abroad easily.<br>
        For this reason,we founded the FOX to play internet games with other people.<br>
        The main purpose of the guild is to have fun.That is first and foremost. 
        <br>
        Of course we don't have ranks and free to join free to leave.<br>
        However,please keep to following regulations.<br>
        </div>
<ul>
        <li>Don't blame people about country,religion and race.
        <li>If someone is in need,we have to help him at all cost.<br>
          
        <li>Be polite than you thought as you ware.
        <li>Don't abuse game's bug to facilite our action.
        <li>Real life is most important. Don't let game interfere with your life.
      </ul>
</ul>
We are waiting for people who can keep those.
