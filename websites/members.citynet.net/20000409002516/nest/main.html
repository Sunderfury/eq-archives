- I'm not going to be able to do any work on the Nest for a while.. have had some things happen IRL that quite simply have taken my will to write code out, and frankly, I don't see it changing anytime soon. My apologies for the viewers of this site, I hope that it has helped you in the past and can continue to do so for the future.<BR>
