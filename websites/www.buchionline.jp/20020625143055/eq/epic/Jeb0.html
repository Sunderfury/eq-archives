のこのこと行ってまいりました。<BR>
事前情報があるので目的地まで一直線だったのですが、着いたところで問題発生。<BR>
<BR>
RtAの護衛付き（苦笑<BR>
<BR>
Jebを怒らすと怖そうなので、Harmonyを使いながら周りの雑魚をPull。<BR>
ConはBlueだったので、大した問題でもなかったかな（ｗ<BR>
<BR>
一通り片付けたところでまた問題発生。<BR>
ワイバーンの巡回ルートらしい（＾＾；<BR>
ドラゴンみたいなヤツが、建物の脇で暫くぼーっとしてました。<BR>
<BR>
とりあえず邪魔者が居なくなった時点で、念の為にConしてみると<BR>
<FONT COLOR='#FF3333' FACE='Areal'>a sarnak imitator looks your way apprehensively -- what would you like your tombstone to say?</FONT><BR>
攻撃する意思はなさそうです（＾＾；<BR>
<BR>
さくっと近寄り、Jeb(Sarnak Imitator)にHail。<BR>
・・・反応ないのでJebかどうか質問。<BR>
あ、反応有り。<BR>
<BR>
Copy of Notesを渡すと、Jeb's Sealが貰えました。
あとは質問すると、色々と喋ってくれます。<BR>

Jeb Lumsed Log<BR>
<BR>
You say, 'Are you Jeb Lumsed?'<BR>
a sarnak imitator says 'Yes I am. Use your most enlightened magic to seek the truth of<BR>
 what is around you.  When that is done, you will know what you seek.<BR>
<BR>
<B>[Copy of Notes]を渡します</B><BR>
a sarnak imitator says 'I see that you have what I was waiting for.<BR>
 Stofo does do excellent work. It seems that you are to start on a long journey.<BR>
 Take this seal and it will guide you on your next step. Seek out the masters of enchantment.<BR>
 In time we will craft the Serpent for you. When you have collected the four parts of the staff,<BR>
 you must combine them in a bundle for me. If you need a sack, just let me know.<BR> 
<FONT COLOR='#FFFF00' FACE='Areal'>You gain party experience!!</FONT><BR>
<B>[Jeb's Seal]を受け取ります</B><BR>
<BR>
You say, 'I need a Sack'<BR>
a sarnak imitator says 'Take this sack and combine the items I requested in it.<BR>
 Then return it to me.<BR>
<B>[Enchanter's Bag]を受け取ります</B><BR>
<BR>
You say, 'What Serpent?'<BR>
a sarnak imitator says 'The first truly powerful enchanter, Krilan Pedin,<BR>
 crafted the Serpent years ago. He trained his students to carry on the<BR>
 trade in a five-step process.  Each student then became a master and chose<BR>
 one of their own students to pass the legacy on to. Four others and I, myself,<BR>
 are current practitioners of the crafting.<BR>
<BR>
You say, 'What are the four other masters?'<BR>
a sarnak imitator says 'The masters are enchanters who have reached the<BR>
 plateau of understanding.  Their names are Modani Qu'Loni, Mizzle Gepple,<BR>
 Nadia Starfeast, and Polzin Mrid. All are master crafters in their own right.<BR>
<BR>
You say, 'Who is Modani?'<BR>
a sarnak imitator says 'Modani is a master of illusions. You should seek him out first.<BR>
 Keep a careful eye out for him - he is never in his true form.<BR>
 The last time I spoke to him, he seemed very excited about his voyage to the elven outpost.<BR>
 You may or may not find more clues about his location there.<BR>
<BR>
You say, 'Who is Mizzle?'<BR>
a sarnak imitator says 'Mizzle is a gnome who has mastered the use of enlightened magic.<BR>
 Go to him once you have spoken to Modani. Mizzle is not one to travel,<BR>
 so you should not have to look far from his home to find him. <BR>
<BR>
You say, 'Who is Nadia?'<BR>
a sarnak imitator says 'The mistress of charm, Nadia is very beautiful.<BR>
 She, too, traveled with her relatives to the new land.<BR>
 I just recently received a letter from her.<BR>
 She says more and more pilgrims and explorers are arriving every day,<BR>
 and that the outpost is well defended now.<BR>
<BR>
You say, 'Who is Polzin?'<BR>
a sarnak imitator says 'Master of the Phantasms - he is the last one you will seek out.<BR>
 Hmm...Polzin is native to Erudin, however, after the incident near Paineel,<BR>
 no one has heard from him. I hope that he is well.<BR>
