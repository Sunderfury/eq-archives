<P>Journal Pages
=============

<P>Bestiary
--------
<LI>Ankheg
  "Beware of the creature known as an ankheg, it can spit a stream of highly
  corrosive acid at its victim."

<LI>Beast, Undead
  "The spells of fire that I cast do not seem very effective against the undead
  beasts that roam these halls."

<LI>Bone creatures
  "Those who rely on the keen edge of a blade in battle will inflict little
  harm against creatures made of bone."

<LI>Carrion Crawler
  "If I had not found the protection against paralyzation scroll earlier, the
  carrion crawlers would have destroyed me."

<LI>Chimera
  "Had I known the chimera could breath fire, I would have prepared some sort
  of protection against such an attack."

<LI>Cockatrice
  "I have seen several cockatrice within these halls, but they did not get
  close enough to turn me to stone."

<LI>Dragon, Blue
  "I fear that a dragon could be here. There are signs of great lightning
  damage that only a blue's breath weapon could do."

 "I think again of the signs marking the presence of a dragon. Most dragons,
  as I recall, have some resistance to magic."

<LI>Elemental
  "I remember early teachings concerning elementals. I do believe they are
  invulnerable to all but magical weapons."

<LI>Gargoyle
  "I would imagine that only weapons of magical nature have the power to hurt
  the stone-like monsters known as gargoyles."

<LI>Ghoul
  "I had little trouble defeating the ghouls, but I hate to think what would
  have happened if one had paralyzed me."

<LI>Grave Mist
  "I encountered an entity known as a grave mist, it appeared unhurt by all
  weapons save those of magical nature."

  "I managed to best the grave mist, but not before it struck me several times,
  weakening my constitution."

  "Strange. The grave mist almost seemed to heal itself when struck by my
  cold-based spells."

<LI>Golem, Flesh
  "Flesh golems are not only invulnerable against normal weapons, but they also
  appear to be magic resistant."

  "These great abominations of flesh, golems as some call them, seem to
  rejuvenate when struck by an electrical attack."

<LI>Groaning Spirit (Banshee)
  "It seems as if the banshee are immune to cold and electrical-based magic."

  "If this is so, I would guess that these groaning spirits are also unharmed
  by normal weapons."

<LI>Hag
  "I was not prepared when the lady, or should I say hag, revealed her true
  form and set upon me with her claws."

<LI>Knight, Death
  "It is a well known fact that a death knight cannot be turned. However, this
  mattered little to me, for I am a mage."

<LI>Lycanthrope, Wererat
  "If it were not for my silver dagger, I would have needed an enchanted
  weapon to fight the wererats that I encountered."

<LI>Medusa, Greater
  "I think it is an ioun stone -- a yellow spindle -- that offers some
  protection against the medusa's petrifying gaze."

  "Beware of an arrow shot from the bow of a great medusa, for they are often
  poisoned!"

<LI>Mummy
  "I am thankful for the fire-based spells at my command. They were most useful
  against the mummies that I encountered."

  "I have learned that even magical weapons do not seem to inflict much damage
  against a mummy."

  "Not only are mummies unharmed by cold-based spells, but they are also
  immune to poison and paralyzation."

<LI>Naga, Spirit
  "The bite of a spirit naga is poisonous, so it is wise to keep a few vials of
  a cure poison potion at hand."

<LI>Ogre Slug
  "I imagine the thick rubbery hide of an ogre slug offers the monster added
  protection against blunt weapons."

  "More than once, the ogre slug I was fighting attempted to hit me with some
  sort of corrosive spittle."

  "One could only surmise that an ogre slug, which spits acid, would be immune
  to similar attacks."

<LI>Scaladar
  "The vicious scaladar, I have learned, are resistant to cold, acid, and
  electrical-based attacks."

  "Having done battle with a scaladar myself, I caution fighters against using
  bladed weapons against this monster."

<LI>Shadow
  "An adventurer should have an enchanted blade at hand if he wishes to do
  battle with a shadow."

  "It seems as if many creatures within this dungeon are immune to cold-based
  spells, and the shadow is no exception."

  "...and the chilling touch of the shadow seems to draw physical strength from
  its victim."

<LI>Shambling Mound
  "My fire-based attacks do not seem very effective against the shambling
  mound's wet and slimy nature."

  "As well, the cold-based spells at my disposal do not seem to inflict full
  damage against the shambling mound."

  "A shambling mound does not seem harmed by crushing blows, nor do edged
  weapons appear very effective."

<LI>Sheet Ghoul
  "Like several other creatures within this dreadful place, the sheet ghoul can
  spit a highly corrosive acid."

<LI>Slithermorph
  "The slithermorph is another creature immune to cold, acid, and
  electrical-based attacks."

  "Like many of the things that lurk within this dreaded place, the
  slithermorph is immune to poisons."

<LI>Spectre
  "...thus the touch of a spectre drains two life energy levels from its
  victim."

  "Only weapons ensorcelled with a magic enchantment have the power to harm a
  spectre."

  "It seems as if the spectre, like most undead, is immune to poison,
  paralyzation, and cold-based spells."

  "One could reason that a raise dead spell would utterly and completely
  destroy a spectre."

<LI>Steel Shadow
  "It is not wise to battle a steel shadow with electrical-based attacks."

<LI>Swordwraith
  "The swordwraith draws strength from any living thing it strikes. In order to
  combat..."

  "...a creature like a swordwraith, one needs a weapon bestowed with powerful
  enchantments."

<LI>Tlincalli
  "Much like the scorpion, I now know that the stinger of a tlincalli releases
  a  very deadly poison."

<LI>Troglodyte
  "I seemed to weaken from the horrible stench that filled the air as I battled
  the troglodyte."

<LI>Troll
  "I had quite simply forgotten that the troll has the power to regenerate.
  Once I had rememb..."

  "...ered this fact, I threw every fire-based spell I had at the troll to
  utterly destroy it."

<LI>Watch Ghost
  "A watch ghost is not only resistant to poison, paralyzation, and cold-based
  attacks, but it is also..."

  "...resistant to death magic. This makes the watch ghost a difficult creature
  to slay."

<LI>Water Weird
  "Neither fire or cold-based spells seem to inflict much damage upon the water
  weird."

  "Although edged weapons seem useless, the water weird appears vulnerable to
  blunt weapons."

<LI>Wight
  "It was unfortunate that I did not have a silver or magic weapon when I
  encountered the wight."

  "... thus did I lose several of my spells when the wight struck and took from
  me a portion of my life energy."

  "Only if I had been a cleric, for I believe that a raise dead spell would
  have instantly destroyed the wight."

<LI>Wraith
  "It is common knowledge that a wraith is immune to normal weapons. And even
  tho..."

  "...ugh the wraith can be hit by silver weapons, they inflict only partial
  damage against this undead horr..."

  "...or. As can be expected of the undead, the wraith is also immune to
  poison, paralyzation, and cold-based magic."

  "There is an ioun stone, a deep blue ellipsoid I believe, that protects
  against an undead's energy drain."

<LI>Wyvern
  "I wish I had the power of the neutralize poison spell. Twice I was struck by
  the poisonous sting of the wyvern."


<P>Special Objects
---------------
<LI>Objects of Khang
  "I found reference to an ancient relic, the helm of Fhang. It was rumored to
  cast an aura of fear aro..."

  "And then, it is rumored, the power of fire resistance was bonded with the
  metal of Fhang's armor."

<LI>Objects of Midnight
  "And no normal weapon of forged steel could harm Midnight while she wore her
  armor."

  "As well, Midnight had a shield, one that would absorb some damage meant for
  her."

  "But in order to see illusions, Midnight relied upon her helm of true seeing.
  With it no..."

<LI>Objects of Keign
  "And when all four relics of Keign were donned, the wearer was bestowed with
  a small amount of magic resistance."

  "It was said that Keign feared what he could not see, so he had a helm forged
  that could detect the invisible."

  "With his shield in hand, I recall reading that Keign was bestowed with a
  token amount of resistance to magic."

<LI>Objects of Ravenna
  "Ravenna, not much is known about her, save that her mantle canceled sleep,
  hold, and paralyzation magic."

<LI>Objects of Onex
  "Onex, the wizard, wore a hat that increased his chances of surviving many
  dangerous situations."

  "I would have cherished Onex's robe, for it decreased the time needed to
  memorize spells."

  "Once all four items of Onex were worn, I believe a certain amount of magic
  resistance was besto..."

<LI>Objects of Myrh
  "I cannot believe that the symbol of Myrh still exists! It was said to
  increase the power of all spells the prie..."

  "...st casts. And Myrh's spells were said to be even more powerful when all
  four of his special items were worn."

<LI>Objects of Ghreu
  "I remember reading that Ghreu's tools and picks could magically repair
  themselves a day after they had been broken."

  "Ghreu's boots, those of nimble prowling, granted him the power of feather
  falling and water walking."

  "The possessor of all of Ghreu's items is supposedly gifted with the power to
  detect illusionary walls and secret doors."

<LI>Objects of Phoos
  "The symbol of Phoos granted the priest the ability to pray for an additional
  spell per spell level."

  "If one could find all four items of Phoos, they would be almost completely
  resistant to all forms of fire."

  "The text reads, as I recall, the mace of Phoos heals its wielder whenever it
  delivers a most damaging blow."


<P>Other Objects
-------------
<LI>Gauntlets
  "I have made a wonderful discovery! Even though I am not a thief, gloves of
  dexterity allow me to pick locks."

<LI>Potions
  "I had mistakenly quaffed the potion of confusion, when I should have hurled
  it at my opponent."

  "One becomes disoriented when the potion of confusion is consumed, so
  attacking and movement becomes difficult."

  "The restore strength potion is needed to counter the strength draining
  attacks of certain undead."

  "I found it a good idea to save several potions of restore strength for the
  dungeon areas that drain one's strength."

  "Food detection potions should only be used when food is scarce and well
  hidden."

<LI>Scrolls
  "Certain levels appear infested with undead, so I am thankful for the scrolls
  that protect me against level draining."

<LI>Books
  "Being a mage of good alignment, I would suffer dire consequences if I read a
  Libram of Ineffable Damnation."

  "Only a wizard of neutral, chaotic neutral, or lawful neutral alignment can
  benefit from the Libram of Gainful Conjuration."

  "The Libram of Silver Magic is valuable to wizards of good alignment, such as
  myself."

  "If you are a priest that is good and true, do not even peruse the pages of a
  Book of Vile Darkness."

  "Only a priest of an evil order may benefit from reading a tome such as the
  Book of Vile Darkness."

  "If a good cleric spends the time to read a Book of Exalted Deeds, wisdom and
  experience are his rewards."

  "However, if an evil priest dares to lay hands on a Book of Exalted Deeds,
  his punishment shall be severe."

  "One may benefit from a Manual of Bodily Health only once. Any attempt to
  gain further benefit is useless."

  "Like another book of its kind, one can only benefit from a Manual of Gainful
  Exercise once."

  "A priest, ranger, or paladin should not even consider opening a Manual of
  Stealthy Pilfering."

  "Likewise, there is no reason for a wizard to read a Manual of Puissant Skill
  at Arms."

  "I am not quite sure of the power of a Vacuous Grimoire, but the name itself
  bodes ill for all who would read its pages."

<LI>Ioun Stones
  "It was a gold prism, an ioun stone I think, and it granted me a small
  resistance to magic."

  "Like the dwarven ability, the bright red rhomboid empowered me with
  underground detection skills."

  "A small green ellipsoid ioun stone increased my ability to survive various
  dangerous situations."

  "Now that I found the clear spindle ioun stone, I no longer have the need for
  food."

  "The iridescent spindle seems to sustain me without air. This stone would
  have been most useful on that water level."

<LI>Wands
  "Is there any use for a wand that hastens the action of one's foe? If so, I
  have failed to disc..."

  "...over it. However, there is also a wand of hinder foe that slows an
  opponent."

<LI>Rings
  "I could not remove the cursed ring of provocation that seemed to attract and
  enrage all sorts of monsters."

  "A warrior would pay a dear price for a ring of might. With it, his attacks
  would be more powerful, inflicting..."

<LI>Miscellaneous Magic Items
  "I have made yet another wondrous discovery -- dust of remove curse. Even a
  fighter can use it to rem..."

<LI>Musical Instruments
  "Feign imagery? I think these pipes grant a bard the power to detect secret
  doors and illusionary walls."

  "When in the hands of a bard, drums of distant thunder can shoot forth bolts
  of lightning."

  "I once recall hearing of a harp of despair, and of its power to instill fear
  in the enemy."

  "I have heard it said that a lute of well being bestows a bard with
  regenerative powers for a short time. This mag..."

  "...ical instrument, this lute of well being, is also said to strengthen a
  weakened bard."

<LI>Non-Magical Items
  "A lone fighter, in a place such as this, would have need of a scrying glass
  to identify the various magical objects."

  "I could not find a way to scale the steep sides of the pit. What I needed
  was a good grappling hook."

  "I have discovered a use for the coins! There are altars with slots in which
  the coins are placed in return for healing."

  "I have concluded that I am rewarded with more powerful healing magic when I
  use a gold coin."


<P>General Hints
-------------
<LI>Items
  "At first I was confused, but I have decided that several magical objects
  lose their power after so many uses."

  "These special objects, those that have limited uses, are best saved for
  times of great need."

  "Though I am anxious to descend, I often spend time thoroughly exploring a
  level for supplies."

  "Being a wizard, it is difficult for me to carry a large number of items, so
  I often find safe locations to stash objects."

  "Rocks, rocks, and more rocks! At least they serve the simple purpose of
  weighing down plates."

  "Until I memorize another identify spell, I must take notes on the various
  powers of an item when I use it."

  "There are many scrolls in this place. I must remember to scribe the new
  spells that I find for later use."

<LI>Maps
  "I am thankful that I have the gift of good maps. I refer to them often, so I
  do not become lost in this maze."

<LI>Doors
  "If I had the strength of a strong fighter I could probably smash some of
  these wooden doors into splinters!"

  "It appears that the keys I find look similar to the keyholes in which they
  are used. I shou..."

  "...ld not have spent the precious time I did trying to use the gold key with
  the iron keyhole."

  "Some of the creatures in this place are not as stupid as I thought. On
  several occasions they opened doors that I clo..."

  "I could not find a way through the door, but I learned that one of the
  creatures was carrying the key that I needed."

<LI>Water Level
  "A level completely filled with water! Using the potions of water breathing
  sparingly, I made my wa..."

  "...y carefully through the level. I wish I had taken the time to learn the
  water breathing spell instead."

<LI>Combat
  "I once read that a great champion knows his opponents well, taking note of
  their strengths and weaknesses."

  "At times, I find it possible to use the workings of a trap against the
  monsters attacking me."

  "It is much easier to fight a number of adversaries one at a time. Now I talk
  like a fighter, the next thing you know..."

<LI>Dungeon Areas
  "I have noticed areas of this dungeon that hinder my movements. It is almost
  as if a huge slow spell has been cast..."

  "I have once again encountered a strange area of dungeon. This one apparently
  weakens me as I make my way..."

  "Something strange is happening here, I seem to grow ravenous with hunger as
  I move through this area of dungeon."

  "A note to fellow mages, there are areas within this place that prevent the
  workings of the arcane -- dead magic!"

  "At first I thought I was losing my mind, but I am now sure that certain
  areas rob one of their knowledge and experience."

  "How such a large area of dungeon was enchanted with a vampirical drain spell
  is beyond me. Never in my life have..."

  "Whoever rules this underground citadel has managed to enchant areas with
  many kinds of magic. These zones..."
