<OL>
<LI>Always make sure you keep your head when killed and get the names of your killers.  
Write the names down with the correct spelling including the case used for each letter 
(note which letters are upper and which are lower case.).  
<LI> Report all attacks to the anti-pk groups that you know, such as <a href="http://www.bck.org">bck</a>.
<LI>Make sure that you put a price on their heads by reporting them to OSI when given 
the opportunity.
<LI> Develop an effective escape strategy...When encountered with overwhelming odds, 
run, recall, teleport, or gate!  The PKs do, so why are you so foolish?
<LI>  Be a member of a powerful, anti-PK guild, like <a href="http://www.bck.org">BCK</a>, and call on your brothers and 
sisters to help you through an on-line-real-time messaging system, such as ICQ or MIRC.
<LI>  Never adventure alone, always have friends to back you up... PKs are cowards and 
avoid encounters with groups.
<LI> Learn to hide or use invisibility spells or both.
<LI>  Use cover whenever possible.  Stay under trees, eaves of houses and other 
camoflage constantly.  If they cannot see you they cannot kill you.
<LI> Use the allnames key to keep track of who is near you and their alignment.  Red 
names kill you.  
<LI>Some PKs kill then go off somewhere and improve their alignment before killing again, or use the Incognito spell, so be careful of those with neutral or even noble names.
<LI>Sometimes the names of PKs give them away.  <a href="http://www.bck.org">BCK</a> keeps a list of all known pks.  PKs often have "smart ass" type names.
<LI>Don't trust anyone you do not know.  Be cautious of all strangers, even if they seem friendly.  Many PKs say something to trap you like.  I need your help, or I was just PKed.
<LI>  Know your surroundings at all times.  Know where your escape routes to nearby 
guarded areas are, and use them...</OL>

Subject: Re: baby jesus... Im sorry for being so hostile in my letter, i hope you understand i was
upset. When i was killed i lost magic plate armor, all but the hands and
helm were magic, and i lost my house key also so i hope you understand why
i was mad. The names of the people who killed me were, Skelldrone (not sure
of spelling) and lady dragon something, (imsorry not sure of her name).
hope that helps.
