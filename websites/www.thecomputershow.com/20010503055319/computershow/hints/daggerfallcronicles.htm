<P>Company Line: Nestled in the Dragontail Mountains, protected from
trespassers by a magic barrier, lies the Scenarist Guild citadel. Ruled
with an iron hand by Nezmyt, the Scenarists are Tamriel's troubadours,
bards, and minstrels, whose notes and observations have been compiled
into a thousand impressive volumes.  In the Year 370 of the Third Era,
Nezmyt created a sect of Imperial scribes who were charged with
recording all historical events, beginning with the defeat of Jagar
Tharn. Smuggled out by an anonymous renegade guild member, the book, now
known as The Dag gerfall Chronicles, was hidden in a shrine of the
Oracle. The Daggerfall Chronicles grants the reader a guided tour of how
to traverse the Daggerfall landscape from a physical, mystical, and
historical perspective. This is the must-have survivor's guide to anyone
venturing forth in Tamriel's region of Daggerfall . Specific answers to
every conceivable question a Daggerfall player could ever have are
contained within.
