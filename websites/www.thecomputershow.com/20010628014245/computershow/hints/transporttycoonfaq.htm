<BR>
0.0 Sorry<BR>
Sorry for not so good English. I am German and using a German version of<BR>
Transport Tycoon. So please send me corrections where translation is<BR>
incorrect or language is *+%&$&. <BR>

<BR>
0.2 This FAQ's version<BR>
This is now version 1.1 of the Transport Tycoon FAQ. <BR>
<BR>
Anything added since the last version is marked on column 1 with a '#'.<BR>
Creation and administration by: Peter Elfers (elfers.pad@sni.de)<BR>
Any hints, corrections, and additions are very welcome. <BR>
<BR>
0.3 About Transport Tycoon<BR>
Transport Tycoon was programmed by Chris Sawyer inspired by Railroad<BR>
Tycoon as mentioned in the manual.<BR>
TT is distributed by Microprose.<BR>
The main idea of TT is to develop a universal transportation system in a<BR>
randomly created world using road vehicles, trains, ships and airplanes.<BR>
The games time range is between 1930 and 2030. The game is 'real time'<BR>
so the speed cannot be changed (but it can be paused).<BR>
Is it worth the money? Well I think you will need about 120 hours<BR>
(depending on your machine speed) to complete one game.<BR>
If you pay 60$ / 100 DM / 330FF for the game you are entertained 120<BR>
hours for only 0.50$ / 0.83DM / 2.75FF per hour. Than you can start a<BR>
second game. <BR>
<BR>
0.4 The demo<BR>
# There is an official Microprose demo available on several ftp-sites.<BR>
# The demo should be on ftp.std.com in the /vendors/COMPUTER_EXPRESS<BR>
# directory.<BR>
# Filename is ttycoon.exe.<BR>
# The demo works only with trains (no airplanes, ships or road vehicles).<BR>
# You never find oil wells. The number of years you can play is limited. <BR>
<BR>
0.5 Cheats<BR>
"[...] Start a new game, and before you build anything else, go to one<BR>
coast and try to build a tunnel all the way through to the other. It<BR>
doesn't have to go all the way, just has to be really expensive.<BR>
Instead of telling you that you don't have enough money, it gives you<BR>
about 400 billion! I've tried this a couple of times and it worked, but<BR>
I didn't try messing with my settings to see if that made a difference.<BR>
[...]" provided by Dave Calvin (calvid@rpi.edu) <BR>
<BR>
In my German version that doesn't work (perhaps its better this way). <BR>
<BR>
0.6 Patches<BR>
There are rumours about a patch available from MicroProse but as far as<BR>
I know, nobody is really informed what it will be for. <BR>
<BR>
I send mail to Brian from MicroProse to get information about a possibly<BR>
existing patch. If I get an answer I will post it and write it down<BR>
here.<BR>
<BR>
1 Installation <BR>
<BR>
1.1 Hardware requirements<BR>
IBM PC AT min. 80386DX25 with 4 MB (as said in technical guide)<BR>
# Bert Paul Rauhut (hz262ra@rs1-hrz.uni-duisburg.de) told me that even<BR>
# a 386SX with 16 MHz and 4 MB is possible (for patient players :) ).<BR>
You will need about 6 MB on your HD and perhaps lots of additional space<BR>
if you want to store lots of saved games (they take up to 250K each).<BR>
A mouse is also required.<BR>
The game is in 640x480 256 colors so you need a SVGA card.<BR>
[T On a normal ET4000 (1MB) the game runs without any VESA-driver and using<BR>
TLIVESA the mouse cursor leaves trailers on the screen. <BR>
<BR>
1.2 Software requirements<BR>
MS-DOS 5.0 or higher (I'll never tried other DOS versions like Novell or<BR>
IBM DOS).<BR>
MS mouse driver 8.2 or higher.<BR>
(requirements taken from the manual of TT)<BR>
# Further notice from Bert Paul Rauhut is that TT is playable with OS/2. <BR>
<BR>
1.3 Problems during installation<BR>
There are no known problems.<BR>
# "TT will not install if you haven't a mouse driver installed." (Bert<BR>
# Paul Rauhut, mentioned above). <BR>
<BR>
1.4 Problems during gameplay<BR>
During the game the mouse pointer can leave trails behind.<BR>
Some people mention that a VESA driver works. Especially that one coming<BR>
with SimCity 2000 should do well. <BR>
<BR>
Mark Dobie (mrd@ecs.southampton.ac.uk) wrote:<BR>
"I have also had one solid lockup. It happened when two of my trains<BR>
collided in a station. The game froze during mid explosion..not even<BR>
ctrl-alt-del would work." <BR>
<BR>
And at one time I had a cold reboot during the game without any<BR>
noticable reason (which means: the game reboots my PC without any action<BR>
from me). <BR>
<BR>
1.5 Serial link with TT<BR>
# Bert Paul Rauhut tried to connect two machines via a null modem cable<BR>
# but failed.<BR>
# I never heard of an existing connection controlled by TT so if anyone<BR>
# did it, please email me.<BR>

# Description of the options:<BR>
# Number of opponents:<BR>
# This value indeicates how much opponents will try to make a bigger<BR>
# transport empire than yours.<BR>
# With this value increasing you harder find a good area to build a<BR>
# station. Furthermore you will sooner reach the vehicle limit.<BR>
# Opponents starts:<BR>
# This is the time you have to find a good place to start before your<BR>
# opponents crowd the map. But even if you select 7 opponents starting<BR>
# immediately they won't. They need time to search for good place, too.<BR>
# Number of cities:<BR>
# Few cities are about 17 or so. In normal condition there were 29 and<BR>
# many means about 40.<BR>
# Number of firms:<BR>
# This indicates how much facilities there are. If you select 'few' you<BR>
# will hardly find two facilities to connect in the beginning (because<BR>
# of the big distance between them).<BR>
# Max. starting loan:<BR>
# This value will change depending on the currency option. I saw it on<BR>
# a minimum of 400,000 DM and 200,000 $. This option is a heavy one<BR>
# because in the beginning you will need lots of money and (like in real<BR>
# life) the bank won't give it to you. Later on you have enough money<BR>
# but could take loans of x millions.<BR>
# Interest rate:<BR>
# Well, the interest rate?<BR>
# Vehicle working expenses:<BR>
# How much you have to pay to keep your vehicles running.<BR>
# Opponents building speed:<BR>
# Here you can decide whether you want to can see the opponents laying<BR>
# track after track (so you can hinder them building) or fast enough<BR>
# to build (for example) their stations just on that place that you<BR>
# have prepared to build a statioin (but you can't because they were<BR>
# faster).<BR>
# Opponents intelligence:<BR>
# Uhm. All selections are synonyms for: _really stupid_<BR>
# I know AI is hard work for a programmer. But I would never sell a<BR>
# game with such a crappy AI.<BR>
# Vehicle breakdowns:<BR>
# Tired of burning or smoking vehicles? This option reduce breakdowns.<BR>
# Subsidies:<BR>
# The first player connecting two facilities/cities mentioned in the<BR>
# subsidies messages gaines an extra profit for delivering goods.<BR>
# This option is the factor.<BR>
# Building costs:<BR>
# You have too much money? Don't care. Set this to the maximum and your<BR>
# tracks, roads etc. are very expensive to build.<BR>
# Area:<BR>
# Number opf lakes/seas:<BR>
# These two options are for the area layout. The amount of water on the<BR>
# map is of course increasing if you select a flater terrain. A hilly<BR>
# area has more and bigger land masses as a very flat area even on equal<BR>
# lakes/seas-settings.<BR>
# Economy:<BR>
# The only noticable thing turning this switch is that sometimes<BR>
# facilities decide to close (without a reason). So all your stations<BR>
# addicted to these facilities are very needles. The faclities declare<BR>
# their closedowns a few days before so you have time to react.<BR>
# Train change direction:<BR>
# It can be very hard to build tracks so that trains never need to<BR>
# change their direction except at track end. You should try that out.<BR>
# Changing direrction in stations is very useful but only at track end<BR>
# is a _challenge_.<BR>
# Disasters:<BR>
# Look at chapter 3.9 for details. <BR>
<BR>
2.2 Other game options<BR>
There are some options for the game. Some can be set before AND during<BR>
the game and some must be set before a game is started.<BR>
Here is a short description of the options: <BR>

<BR>
3 Gameplay <BR>
<BR>
3.1 Building stations<BR>
There are six different types of stations that can be build in TT:<BR>
- railway station (passenger, mail, all goods)<BR>
- bus station (passenger)<BR>
- lorry station (mail, all goods)<BR>
- dock (mail, passengers, all goods)<BR>
- airport (mail, passengers, all goods)<BR>
- oil platforms (act as airport + dock for passengers & oil)<BR>
On some stations it is not possible to pick up some goods because there<BR>
are no suitable transportatiopn units available (at that time).<BR>
For example early in the game you can only pick up passengers and mail<BR>
at airports because the planes can only transport them (and no goods).<BR>
For efficient use several types of stations can be combined. For example<BR>
you build an airport to make fast delivery of passengers. Your airport<BR>
is near a coal mine and the coal at your airport is up to 1000 or so and<BR>
your rating in coal is down to 11% then just build a train station next<BR>
to your aiport and pick up the coal with a train. This also saves one<BR>
station.<BR>
Saving stations can be very important as your transport empire will<BR>
grow. <BR>
<BR>
+--++--+ AP = Airport<BR>
|AP||TS| TS = Train station<BR>
| |+--+<BR>
+--+ <BR>
<BR>
An additional advantage is that you can use the existing store in an<BR>
older station. But do not wait too long. The store will shrink if you<BR>
never start to pick up some of it. <BR>
<BR>
Docks can only be built on shore lines: one field on water and one on<BR>
the shore.<BR>
All other stations require flat terrain to be built. <BR>
<BR>
# Station layout can be very interesting. A station can be spreaded into<BR>
# two or more areas. Markku Tuovinen & Chuck O'Toole wrote this:<BR>
#<BR>
# ">A nice feature is that you can build different stations adjacent to<BR>
# > each other and get a "mega-station". I built an airport, truck<BR>
# > platform and bus station all touching. This resulted in 1 station<BR>

# > became a pool that the planes and busses/mail trucks could draw from.<BR>
# > This seems to be better than having separate stations where, for<BR>
# > example,the bus passengers could get mad and leave because of poor<BR>
# > service while the airplanes fly with open seats.<BR>
#<BR>
# Also, you can build separated single stations with this feature. Build<BR>
# an airport. Build a long station facing away from it towards the center<BR>
# of the town (stripmine houses or, rather, a road). Build a bus station<BR>
# or a truck stop on the other end of the railroad station. Bulldoze the<BR>
# station. The bus stop is still part of the airport.<BR>
#<BR>
# Also, I moved a truck stop affiliated with a farm railroad station about<BR>
# halfway to the center of the map and put trucks to carry farm produce<BR>
# (livestock, grain) to a nearby factory (like 10 squares away). An<BR>
# instant $10,000 per load, since the station sign (and the actual<BR>
# station) were on the edge of the map, about 50 squares away so the<BR>
# price on produce was calculated using that figure... I rationalized it<BR>
# by using the warrior-scientist explanation. One day between breakfast<BR>
# and lunch my company president just figured out a way (a costly one,<BR>
# though) to transmit matter instantly... (so I'm a sci-fi buff). Of<BR>
# course, all components of a scatter station have to be on the same<BR>
# level, so your ability to develop mattermission is kinda cramped by huge<BR>
# hills etc." <BR>
<BR>
3.2 Connecting two stations<BR>
To stations can be connected by laying a track (for trains), a road (for<BR>
busses and lorries) or using an existing road system laid by opponents<BR>
or cities (very cheap). Of course airports and docks do not need<BR>
a special track. <BR>
<BR>
If you connect two stations by road be aware of rail crossings. Lots of<BR>
busses and lorries die every year killed by reckless trains.<BR>
Building bridges over tracks is cheaper on the long run. <BR>
<BR>
On the other hand lay YOUR tracks over roads which are used by opponent<BR>
players and watch the newspaper for further reports. <BR>
<BR>
For ships with complex routes (around a peninsula for example) buoys are<BR>
necessary. Place them one the turning points on the ship route and<BR>
insert them in the ship schedule (for both directions of course (!)).<BR>
But buoys count as a station (someone mentioned that on the news but I<BR>
can't remember his name. Thanks to him and sorry.) <BR>
<BR>
3.3 When to use what type of transportation<BR>
That depends on the distance, type and amount of the goods. Use<BR>
airplanes for very fast and long distance mail and passenger service.<BR>
Use trains for fast and middle distance mail and passenger service. Use<BR>
busses and lorries for not so fast short distance mail and passenger<BR>
service.<BR>
Ships are only interesting for additional service because they can't<BR>
carry very much load (An oil tanker can carry up to 220 t of oil. A<BR>
A train with 8 oil cars can carry up to 240 t of oil). You can make<BR>
more money using a train.<BR>
"Ships will sometimes give a more direct route across a river or a bay<BR>
where a land route would be much longer. Remember that lots of bridges<BR>
can slow a train down to less than half of its top speed.<BR>
Hovercraft can be very profitable too." [Mark Dobie<BR>
(mrd@ecs.southampton.ac.uk)] <BR>
<BR>
But if that area is very developed and there is no room for additional<BR>
tracks a ship service can be added without bigger problems. <BR>
<BR>
Ships are very useful if later in the game the first oil platforms are<BR>
introduced. For those platforms helicopters can be useful too because<BR>
there is a helipad landing place on it and an oil platform accepts and<BR>
supplies passengers (also accepts mail). <BR>
<BR>
A large lake (distance between shores >16 squares) can't be crossed by<BR>
a bridge. Using ships can be solve such problems. And bridges with more<BR>
than 8 squares can't be used with high speed (except from monorails).<BR>
<BR>
Since most of the goods can only be carried by train or lorry these two<BR>
transportation systems are commonly used. Trains are faster a safer than<BR>
lorries (too many lorries die on level crossings).<BR>
But be aware of the train limit (see chapter limitations). It is very<BR>
annoying to replace an existing track because you really need a train on<BR>
the other side of the map but you have already 80 trains in service. <BR>
<BR>
Road service is very interesting for inner city service where a track is<BR>
not possible (because you cannot clear those fields in the middle of the<BR>
road). Besides road service is interesting as an additon to an airport<BR>
or a train station the plane/train service is poor rated (e.g. mail<BR>
service on airports). <BR>
<BR>
Dave's (davidl@cs.uq.oz.au) method:<BR>
"...it's useful to ferry goods to/from the train station/docks from/to<BR>
the city by lorry/bus. Kind of a linked service. Obviously the last<BR>
link in the service gets paid though.<BR>
I use such a strategy if I have say multiple mines on one side of a<BR>
refinery. I unload ore from the furthest away onto the closer station,<BR>
so that I only need a single train going the whole way (the same method<BR>
can be applied to anything else of course)." <BR>
<BR>
3.4 Changing train layout/selling vehicles<BR>
If you want to sell a vehicle or change the layout of a train or replace<BR>
an older model with a newer one click with LMB on the depot symbol in<BR>
the vehicle window to direct it to the nearest depot. Once arrived in<BR>
the depot you will get a message. Now click on the depot to open the<BR>
depot window. Your vehicle is shown there. If you want to scrap it press<BR>
and hold the LMB on it and drop it to the trashcan on the right. The<BR>
value of that vehicle should now be added to your funds. <BR>
<BR>
"Sometimes it says 'Can't sell vehicle'. I've only ever had this with<BR>
trains and I haven't worked out why yet. In this case you have to buy<BR>
the new train and set up route manually. Usually you can sell the old<BR>
train a while later." [Mark Dobie (mrd@ecs.southampton.ac.uk)] <BR>
<BR>
If you want to build new cars for your train scrap the old cars or move<BR>
them to the next line. Buy new cars and (if necessary) connect them to<BR>
your engine. <BR>
<BR>
If you want to replace an old fashioned model with a newer one scrap<BR>
the engine leaving the cars where they are. Buy a new model and connect<BR>
the cars (if necessary) to the new engine. The orders of the old engine<BR>
should be already transferred to your new engine. <BR>
<BR>
Orders can only reused in the same depot. <BR>
<BR>
3.5 City menu<BR>
By clicking on a cities name with the LMB you will see an information<BR>
window about that city. Choosing the city government button you gain<BR>
access to a lot of possible actions (if you have enough money).<BR>
The available options are: <BR>
<BR>
little advertising campaign<BR>
raises your ratings a bit<BR>
medium advertising campaign<BR>
raises your ratings a lot<BR>
large advertising campaign<BR>
raises your ratings to the top<BR>
give money for road improvement<BR>
look the other players lorries standing in a tangled mass of roadworks<BR>
build a statue of your company<BR>
nice, isn't it? I don't know for what it is good for.<BR>
give money for house building<BR>

3.6 How trains and signals work<BR>
Because sometimes the computer AI seems to be stupid while controlling<BR>
a train network, this chapter is added to explain how trains and signals<BR>
work.<BR>
Of course I do not know how the programmer did his work, but observation<BR>
gives a clue on how a track has to be laid. <BR>
<BR>
Every train needs a track, two stations and a depot to work properly.<BR>
On a track there can be only one train at a time (a few exceptions are<BR>
explained later). A track can be separated into different parts. Signals<BR>
and depots are valid separators, stations aren't. If you want to use a<BR>
station as a separator, place signals on all ingoing tracks in front of<BR>
the station. <BR>
<BR>
Trains try to use the shortest route to their destination station. So if<BR>
two different tracks are possible it will take the shorter one. <BR>
<BR>
On a switch a train (A) must choose which way to go. Before it chooses<BR>
the way the computer is looking for the shortest route to the<BR>
destination.<BR>
If this route is occupied by another train (B) it will choose the longer<BR>
route. If there is no other route to the destination it is possible that<BR>
it will choose a track going to anywhere but never to the destination.<BR>
I think this is done to go away from a point where it could block the<BR>
path of the train (B).<BR>
When two trains meet each other at a signal on a single track from<BR>
different directions, they will both stop at signal blocking each other.<BR>
After a short while one of them is timed out and that one will change<BR>
directions to go back.<BR>
To avoid this situation a train can choose the 'wrong' (that means wrong<BR>
direction) track at a switch. <BR>
<BR>
The easiest way is to build one track for one train. Expensive but very<BR>
effective because even a blonde [:)] train can use a simple track<BR>
without getting lost.<BR>
If you are not experienced start with this method. Later in the game you<BR>
will usually have enough money for experiments. <BR>
<BR>
You can also set up two trains on one track using short parts of double<BR>
tracks. <BR>
<BR>
"[...]I build tracks in this way and it works well with two trains,<BR>
insert more parts with double track if you want more trains. <BR>
<BR>
SSSSSS-------<=|========|=>------SSSSSS <BR>
<BR>
Where<BR>

< : Split one track into two<BR>
> : Join two tracks into one <BR>
<BR>
[...]" provided by Martin Nilsson (d90mn@efd.lth.se). <BR>
<BR>
This is also mentioned in the manual: <BR>
<BR>
/S-------------S\ - / \ = track<BR>
-----S-------------S--------- S = signal <BR>
<BR>
This will work well with one exception. Both trains tend to use the same<BR>
part of the double track, the straight one. A better design is: <BR>
<BR>
-----S-------------S\<BR>
\S-------------S--------- <BR>
<BR>
because if one train is after the switch but before the signal while the<BR>
other train coming from the other side must choose a track on the switch<BR>
they will both take the same track because the next part of the track is<BR>
not occupied by another train. But they will end up on a signal as<BR>
described above. <BR>
<BR>
This happens rarely but I saw it more than one time. <BR>
<BR>
The method above can be expanded to a system with three trains on one<BR>
track using stations with three tracks and a part of triple track some-<BR>
where. <BR>
<BR>
Hint1:Its more efficient to place the double/triple track near the<BR>
station where trains are loaded because on that station they will<BR>
need more time at the loading station and less time for the rest<BR>
rest of the track. If they need nearly the same time for loading<BR>
and unloading place it in the middle of the track.<BR>
Hint2:(again from Dave (davidl@cs.uq.oz.au)) Also you should build these<BR>
"overtake" sections of tracks so that trains can use them to turn<BR>
around (like the computer does), so that a train heading down the<BR>
wrong track can turn around without having to go all the way to<BR>
the end. <BR>
<BR>
Sometimes train behavior seems to be strange when a train has reached<BR>
its maintainence date. And they always seek for the nearest depot. <BR>
<BR>
---------------------T>-------------------------------------STATION<BR>
D-/ <BR>
<BR>
So if the train T driving in direction > in the example above reaches on<BR>
that position its maintanence date it will drive to the station, changes<BR>
direction and went to the depot. After the maintanance it will go back<BR>
to station for the daily work. <BR>
<BR>
If you set up a network connecting more than two stations together with<BR>
lots of trains and switches, watch for the locations of your depots.<BR>
A train will even use other trains track and depot if that depot is<BR>
nearer. Placing depots on each connected side of a station and near<BR>
switches which are used from more than two trains give best performance. <BR>
<BR>
If your network layout is buggy you will get a mess. And it is very<BR>
difficult to clean up a corrupted track net. In that case building<BR>
additional tracks just to let the trains to their own part is useful.<BR>
Destroy those tracks after use. <BR>
<BR>
Sometimes it is useful to tell a train to went on on a red signal. Use<BR>
the button in the train information window to do that. <BR>
<BR>
This is one exception where two trains can use the same part of a track.<BR>
Watch carefully for your trains or tell them good by. <BR>
<BR>
It is no problem as long as they have enough room. Even this situation<BR>
works well: <BR>
<BR>
---T>S-------A(with train)<BR>
\----A(empty) <BR>
<BR>
A is a station with one empty place; T a train waiting on the signal S.<BR>
If you know that the train in the station needs more time for loading<BR>
than the other for entering the station you can tell the waiting train<BR>
to go on. It will not use the occupied part of the station.<BR>
(no signals in front of the station) <BR>
<BR>
I noticed that sometimes in the mid game it is difficult to find a place<BR>
to lay a track. Sometimes lowering the terrain and build long tunnels<BR>
under a city or lots of tracks and stations of other players can help.<BR>
The tunnel can even be on sea level without being flooded. <BR>
<BR>
"I've also noticed that if you are runnning a line with multiple<BR>
routes that include lots of stations (using a junction to split the<BR>
routes), it's sometimes necessary to explicitly include in the schedule<BR>
the station order for both directions of the route (e.g. a route going<BR>
from A->B->C->D and back may need to be scheduled as A->B->C->D->C->B.<BR>
I've seen one such train service where the train refused to take the<BR>
correct branch of a track junction until I exlicitly scheduled the<BR>
return section of the route as above!<BR>
In this case the lines looked something like: <BR>

(from David (davidl@cs.uq.oz.au)) <BR>
<BR>
[The section above contains a lot of information from others] <BR>
<BR>
There was an interesting posting by Chuck O'Toole in the NetNews which<BR>
I added without cutting. <BR>
<BR>
"Well, I got hooked on the Transport Tycoon (TT) demo during the<BR>
Thanksgiving holiday. I know what I want for Christmas ;-) <BR>
<BR>
I've seen lots of posts about train behavior and I think I have part of<BR>
it figured out. I hope the manual is more clear about it. What<BR>
follows is my current (working) theory about train movements, signals,<BR>
and the like. Please excuse me if I incorrectly attribute a post to<BR>
the wrong person. <BR>
<BR>
First off, signals do *not* work like Railroad Tycoon (RRT). In RRT,<BR>
signals are places where trains could pass. Not so with TT. Signals<BR>
indicate a clear or busy path/section of track to the next down the<BR>
line. Additionally, RRT treated each station as a signal, no such<BR>
notion in TT. <BR>
<BR>
Having two trains meet at the same signal (and stop!) would<BR>
result in a deadly embrace, each train waiting for the other to move.<BR>
Apparently, there is some timeout which causes a train to reverse<BR>
course if it waits too long at a signal. <BR>
<BR>
Someone (traynor@bostech.com (Pat Traynor) I believe) wrote:<BR>
> I believe that the following scenario has be deemed unworkable:<BR>

<BR>
Someone (I forgot who) suggested placing 3 signals in this config, on<BR>
each track leading to the junction. <BR>
<BR>
+---+<BR>
| A |--<BR>
+---+ \<BR>
S +---+<BR>
>S------| C |<BR>
S +---+
<BR>
+---+ /<BR>
| B |--<BR>
+---+ <BR>
<BR>
This would create 4 sections of track, the A section, the B section,<BR>
the C section (please hold your puns), and the common junction. This<BR>
arrangement is almost totally non-functional. <BR>
<BR>
Should the A-C train and the B-C train approach the junction at the<BR>
same time, one would wait and the other proceed to C. Once the last<BR>
car clears the signal leading to C, the other train would enter the<BR>
junction. There, it would find the signal to C set Red. Here, the<BR>
B-C train could either wait at the signal or take the A section which<BR>
is clear. Waiting at the signal would lead to an eventual deadly<BR>
embrace since the A-C train needs to use the junction to return to A<BR>
and the B-C train is blocking it. <BR>
<BR>
When a train is confronted by a red signal, it appears to take an open<BR>
track if one is available, stop, or sometimes reverse direction (if a<BR>
train is on the other side of the signal). Hence, the B-C train would<BR>
take the A section, which on the surface seems stupid, but is the only<BR>
open path available to it. Many of the odd behaviors of my trains were<BR>
due to signals placed close to branches or depots so that the train<BR>
would turn rather than stop. <BR>
<BR>
The B-C train will go to the A station and reverse direction, allowing<BR>
time for the path to C to free up. You can see how this would<BR>
oscillate until the A-C train returned to the junction. Which way it<BR>
went would depend on which section the B-C train was at that time. <BR>
<BR>
To correct this route, the C section needs a passing siding, thusly, <BR>
<BR>
+---+<BR>
| A |--<BR>
+---+ \<BR>
S +---+<BR>
>--S---------S------| C |<BR>
S \S---------S/ +---+<BR>
+---+ /<BR>
| B |--<BR>
+---+ <BR>
<BR>
Note the placement of the signals on the siding. The space *between*<BR>
the signals needs to be long enough to completely capture the train.<BR>
A section of track is not considered clear until the last car passes<BR>
the signal. I had two trains pass at a siding and both stop because the<BR>
last car was on the same square as the signal and hence, not clear.<BR>
This arrangement will work for the original stated purpose. Until.... <BR>
<BR>
Trains become very single-minded when the service date arrives.<BR>
Regardless of where they are, they head straight to the nearest depot,<BR>
get serviced, and return to whatever they were doing. It's this<BR>
obsession with getting serviced that sometimes puts more trains on the<BR>
section of track than you designed for. In the above example, if the<BR>
only depot was near B, at some time, the A-C train would try to use the<BR>
B section to get to the depot, causing the odd reversal behavior until<BR>
they finally sorted themselves out again. <BR>
<BR>
As a general rule, I do not place signals on single sections of track<BR>
(except for X crossings) and place depots near each station.<BR>
Additionally, the depot should not be adjacent to a signal as red would<BR>
cause the train to enter the depot instead of stop (and then it would<BR>
most likely reverse direction). Instead I place the depot a few<BR>
sections down the line. <BR>
<BR>
Multiple platform stations need signals at the entry to the platform<BR>
and crossing track to permit trains to enter the "switching yard" and<BR>
go to either platform or the depot. E.g., <BR>
<BR>
P1-S--------------[and later down the line]--S-------------S-----<BR>
X [depending on how near ] \S-------------S/<BR>
P2-S----Depot [you need the siding ] <BR>
<BR>
(the arrangement for 3 or more platforms is an exercise for the reader<BR>
or for when I get the real version and have more time to play). <BR>
<BR>
Once I had some basic observations and a working theory of how the<BR>
trains work, all the behavior makes sense. When I saw something<BR>
unexpected happen, I looked for problem with my signal setup and have<BR>
been able to correct everything so far. I've been going under the<BR>
assumption that the game is working correctly and that I just have to<BR>
deduce the rules of operation. Something I hope the manual will clear<BR>
up. <BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps folks out there. " <BR>
<BR>
This article is mentioned here ignoring some review of previous stuff<BR>
in this FAQ because it was the first posting I think which fits computer<BR>
AI in TT best. And the auther has only got the demo(!). Good work Chuck. <BR>
<BR>
An example: Building a 4-track station and use it for 8(!) trains<BR>
without getting confused <BR>
<BR>
On some places there are so many facilities near to each other that you<BR>
want send lots of trains to the same station. I tried the following and<BR>
it works well. <BR>
<BR>
XXXX<BR>
XXXX<BR>
XXXX X = airport (optional)<BR>
D XXXX D D = depot<BR>
----S*S[STATION]S*S---- S = signal<BR>
----S*S[STATION]S*S---- - = normal track<BR>
----S*S[STATION]S*S---- B = bus station (optional)<BR>
----S*S[STATION]S*S---- L = lorry station (optional)<BR>
D B L D * = track system looking like: /|\<BR>
(all on one square) -+-<BR>
\|/ <BR>
<BR>
Don't build further depots in the near. All eight trains can share the<BR>
four depots in the picture. And don't connect a track going to the left<BR>
in a big circle to a track coming from the right. <BR>
<BR>
If you decide to add an airport, a bus station and/or a lorry station<BR>
all those together are of course only ONE station.<BR>
And be sure there si some traffic in that area. <BR>
<BR>
3.7 Reliability of vehicles<BR>
As time goes by (sounds sentimental, eh?) newer vehicles will be<BR>
available. But never trust a 1.0 version you know. The first ones are<BR>
so susceptible to breakdowns that you should wait a year (or two) before<BR>
you start using it in your transportation system.<BR>
Look in the 'build new vehicle' window where the technical details are<BR>
mentioned. You will find a value of reliability. Than you can decide<BR>
whether you want to buy a vehicle which is 45% of its time out of order<BR>
or stay using your older model. <BR>
<BR>
But do not wait too long. Don't build vehicles which are introduced 30<BR>
years ago because of their high reliability value. Lots of vehicles can<BR>
be used 20 to 30 years. If the design is old fashioned it will become<BR>
less reliable in the following years. <BR>
<BR>
After a vehicle was maintained it gains its maximum reliablity back.<BR>
But this maximum can change with the years. You will not be informed! <BR>
<BR>
Best performance have models which are designed ca. 5 years ago (+/-2). <BR>
<BR>
3.8 The monorail system<BR>
In the year 1998 the first monorail will be developed.<BR>
Monorails are something completely new. A new submenu is available under<BR>
the 'build track' button in the menu line. Of course you cannot use the<BR>
normal track to run monorails. And you cannot use the old stations,<BR>
signals, depots etc.<BR>
After playing for 68 years there are normally no more vehicles<BR>
available. I started to rebuild my complete railway system to use only<BR>
the monorail because of its advantages.<BR>
Top speed is now 255km/h (railway: 249km/h). The X2001 monorail engine<BR>
has got 10000PS (railway: 8000PS).<BR>
More important is the maximum bridge length of 16 squares can be crossed<BR>
with a top speed of 241km/h (railway: 112km/h) and new cars are<BR>
available usually carrying 5t more than the ones of the railway (see<BR>
tables below). <BR>
<BR>
The disadvantage: no more level crossings. <BR>
<BR>
3.9 Disasters<BR>
In the options you can set the parameter 'disasters' either on or off.<BR>
Disasters are not normal accidents like plane crashes or traffic<BR>
accidents. The following disasters I saw in my game: <BR>
<BR>
- The land under a coal mine collapses.<BR>
When this is happen, the terrain under and around a coal mine can be<BR>
affected. Normally lots of roads and tracks are destroyed in that<BR>
area. <BR>
<BR>
- Collision with an UFO<BR>
From time to time a little UFO flies over your cities searching for<BR>
a road vehicle of the human(!) player. When a suitable vehicle is<BR>
found the UFO goes down and destroys the vehicle. <BR>
<BR>
- Factory or Refinery was destroyed under mysterios circumstances<BR>
In this case a flying military object (helicopter or conbat aircraft)<BR>
destroyed a factory of refinery. I saw no other facilities destroyed<BR>
by them.<BR>
Don't bother about your trains or other vehicles going to the ruins.<BR>
The production rate remains and the facilities will be rebuild soon. <BR>
<BR>
- UFO landing near a city<BR>
A large UFO lands somewhere in the area. Sometimes the only thing<BR>
happening is the start off of the UFO going to where it came from.<BR>
But sometimes a combat aircraft attacks and destroys the UFO leaving<BR>
a 4x4 (or was it 5x5) square of wasted land.<BR>
If there are no facilities or tracks in the adjacent squares you can<BR>
ignore it. <BR>
<BR>
- Zeppelin crashes on an airport<BR>
A huge zeppelin is flying to an airport of the human player and than<BR>
goes down, exploding in a tremendous fire. <BR>
<BR>
3.A Anything becomes more expensive<BR>
Like in the real world (ther is one outside your monitor) anything you<BR>
wish to buy becomes more expensive in TT. I think there is an inflation<BR>
model included in TT. Remember the 'starting interest rate' in the<BR>
options? And the constant or uneven economy factor? <BR>
<BR>
You will notice soon that your engines, cars, stations etc. and building<BR>
tracks and roads become more expensive. <BR>
<BR>
In my opinion an econmy factor is created by chance so your interest<BR>
rates and price increases are calculated. If you choose constant economy<BR>
this factor won't change. You can see this on the amount of payment of<BR>
interest for 400,000 (for example). You have to pay the same every year.<BR>
<BR>
4 Strategies <BR>
<BR>
4.1 Starting strategies<BR>
To make lots of money fast watch for subsidies. Build only those<BR>
connections and wait until the next subsidy is published.<BR>
After two or three years you have a basic transportation system which<BR>
can be expanded quickly. <BR>
<BR>
To start with a transportation system based on railroad transporting<BR>
only passengers and mail between nearby cities needs more time at first<BR>
but later on you will receive lots of money for those trains, the cities<BR>
love you and they will grow extremely fast. And you never have the<BR>
problem finding a good site in a big city where you can build a railway<BR>
station (that can be difficult). To add a lorry station or a bus stop<BR>
should never be a problem. <BR>
<BR>
4.2 Strategies during the game<BR>
Build as fast as you can. Always use the credit limit to build more more<BR>
more. You will soon reach the point where additional building is not<BR>
longer possible (see chapter limitations). Then you can fight against<BR>
your rivals (see next chapter). <BR>
<BR>
4.3 Fighting against opponents<BR>
There are some ruthless methods to sabotage and hinder an opponent. I<BR>
wouldn't use these methods during a two-player game because it could be<BR>
annoying to always look at all tracks and roads (but who cares about<BR>
the computer?). <BR>
<BR>
4.3.1 Building tracks over roads<BR>
Trains can run over lorries and buses destroying them. So laying a<BR>
track over opponents roads can cause lots of damage (trains never be<BR>
destroyed). <BR>
<BR>
You can even build a track to the crossing, sending a train and<BR>
destroying the track after the train arrives at the crossing. No lorry<BR>
will ever cross that track! <BR>
<BR>
4.3.2 Building tracks over roads and destroying the track<BR>
This is a (buggy) way to destroy a road of your opponent because after<BR>
you build the track the square will be yours. <BR>
<BR>
4.3.3 Building diagonal tracks<BR>
Since diagonal tracks can't be crossed with bridges or crossings<BR>
building them is a good method to prevent an area or some fields to be<BR>
used by other players.<BR>
In earlier years you need an 3x4 field for a small airport. Later when<BR>
bigger airplanes are available you will need a big airport on a 6x6<BR>
area. With diagonal track segments you can keep the needed area clean<BR>
and later there is no need to destroy the houses or the roads of the<BR>
city or, let another player use that area.<BR>
Hint: Two stations of different players cannot be built next to each<BR>
other. There must be a one square gap between them. <BR>
<BR>
4.3.4 Buy transportation monopols<BR>
If you have enough money you can buy a transportation monopol in a<BR>
city for one year (see 3.7). Use this to let your opponents routes<BR>
become no longer profitable.<BR>
This seems to decrease your overall performance rating in the stats<BR>
but I don't know why. <BR>
<BR>
4.3.5 Roadworks for your opponents profitable routes<BR>
Pay those cities to improve their roads (that means a lot of roadwork<BR>
without any improvement) where an opponent have profitable road<BR>
service (see 3.7). <BR>
<BR>
4.3.6 Build depots at rear panel of enemy stations<BR>
Building depots on the rear side of your opponents stations is a very<BR>
good method to get rid of his trains. Build a Jinty in your station<BR>
and wait for an opponents train. Now start your engine...boom. <BR>
<BR>
4.4 Cities growth<BR>
# It is very difficult to say what things effects cities growth.<BR>
# All cities start between 10 and ca. 750 inhabitants. They grow even if<BR>
# they aren't affected from any players station or vehicles. But picking<BR>
# up or delivering goods seem to increase their growth.<BR>
# But constant building in the near city area will hinder growth. A city<BR>
# with the possiblity to develop the area around it without beeing<BR>
# disturbed by building tracks and roads (or scratching houses of the<BR>
# city) develop best. The more goods transported from/to the city the more<BR>
# money the city will get. In end game I saw a city with more than 16,000<BR>
# inhabitants. Lots of cities start growing fast a few years after I stop<BR>
# building new tracks or reconfiguring my transportation network.<BR>
# In some cases I was able to _see_ the city growing. In two years from<BR>
# 5,000 inhabitants up to 10,000 - 14,000.<BR>
#<BR>
# There was an interesting article in the NetworkNew from Chris Smith:<BR>
#<BR>
# "I think I figured out how cities grow. It tends to make a lot of 2x1<BR>
# and 1x1 blocks, but you can get much higher densities if you lay out the<BR>
# streets yourself.<BR>
#<BR>
# The rule seems to be that buildings need to be next to 2 road squares,<BR>
# or one road and bare land. ('next to' as in king moves -- n,s,e,w.)<BR>
#<BR>
# If you just let it grow, it will make a pleasing but inefficient city.<BR>
# If you want lots of passengers, make Manhattan -- lots of 1 x n blocks<BR>
# to grow skyscraper canyons. If this is too boring, you can do the<BR>
# same thing with L-shaped or S-shaped blocks, as long as they're<BR>
# a bent form of a 1 x n strip.<BR>
#<BR>
# The roving stadiums are neat because they leave behind 2-wide blocks<BR>
# which keeps the city density from deteriorating even worse. I have<BR>
# no idea what makes banks grow, but I think they tend to appear out<BR>
# in the boonies because they just don't fit anywhere else in a homegrown<BR>
# city layout.<BR>
#<BR>
# I think bus and truck stations count as roads -- this works<BR>

5.6 Limitations<BR>
The number of stations, road vehicles, trains, airplanes and ships is<BR>
limited. <BR>
<BR>
player city game<BR>
Stations 48 ?? ??<BR>
Road vehicles 80 NL -+<BR>
airplanes 80 NL | not more than ? vehicles<BR>
trains 40 NL |<BR>
ships 50 NL -+ <BR>
<BR>
NL = no limitation<BR>
?? = there is a limitation but I do not know the number. <BR>
<BR>
(information taken from news from David Skreiner<BR>
(david@htu.tu-graz.ac.uk) and Robert Court<BR>
(robert@court.cityscape.co.uk). Many thanks) <BR>
<BR>
If you reach the maximum number of vehicles you cannot build additional<BR>
cars for existing trains. <BR>
<BR>
For the maximum number of vehicles this seems to be valid:<BR>
1 plane = 2 road vehicles<BR>
1 train engine = 1 road vehicle<BR>
1 train car = 1 road vehicle<BR>
1 ship = 1 road vehicle<BR>
So a train engine with three cars is equivalent (number of vehicles)<BR>
with 4 lorries. <BR>
<BR>
Watch for trains with engines at front and rear side of the train. Those<BR>
count for two vehicles. If you build them if only one vehicle is<BR>
possible, the back car doesn't appear. <BR>
<BR>
If you reach on of the limits, your difficulty options were set too easy<BR>
for you. Try harder settings. <BR>
<BR>
Due to very crappy service a city can prohibit further buildings of your<BR>
company on its area. Do better service and try again.

I don`t want to sound rude, but could you get a few more cheats?
I have games like Transport Tycoon (regular), NFSSE, NFS2 and Sega TouringCar Championship.
If you managed to get cheats to any of these (I know they exist) I would be deeply greatful.
    Thanx
