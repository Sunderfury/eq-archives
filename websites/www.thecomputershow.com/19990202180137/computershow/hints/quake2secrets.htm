continues into an opening. Take a look under the stairs you entered the room

as far as you can go in the water and dive under the wall and find secret no2.<BR>

ledge - there is a red giveaway button to shoot at. Do it and a secret door
opens with some goodies. Secret no3.<BR>

<P>Installation - 2 secrets<BR>
1 - When you come to a broken bridge (it actually blows up) enter the water
and try to find a SMALL entrance next to a quite large one. In there, in the wall,
there is a large crack. Shoot at it and it will blow (?) up and a weapon reveals
itself. <BR>
2 - At the end of the map after crossing the water dividing the level you will find

(avoid getting in their way). Down into the water, crouch, and find yourself
secret no2.<BR>

into the water and find the red giveaway button. Shoot the red giveaway, then
turn 180 degrees and kill the enemy. Go into the new opening.<BR>
4 - Well, as you discovered the button to the red keycard you flipped, also
flipped the floor upwards. But what opens under the floor? Well, run around or
shoot it and quickly run beyond it and find secret no4. <BR>
5 - In the water surrounding the tower there is a suspicious looking piece of
wall. Shoot it, kill whatever comes out, enter the new hole, surface in there and
find some goodies.<BR>
6 - Ok...jump up to the cradles. Then you just make a long jump over to the
other side. Secret no6. <BR>

<P><a name="Unit 2">Unit 2</a> - Warehouse Unit 

<P>Ammo Depot - 3 secrets <BR>
1 - In the first room up in one corner of the room there is a small red button.
Shoot it and a secret door in the wall will open, secret no1. <BR>
2 - In one of the larger rooms you have to push a button so you start a crane
with a cargo which crushes a door. In that room you will find a small button that
opens up the floor were you came from. Go down the newly revealed stairs and
find a secret. <BR>
3 - After a while you come to a big room with a bridge attached to the roof
crossing a big lava puddle. The bridge is able to dip itself into the lava with a
press on the button at its beginning. When you cross it slip down beside it and

one corner a door will open when you come close to it. <BR>

corner there is a box with a different color. Shoot at it and a door opens. Crotch
and enter for a goodie and a secret. <BR>

cradle outside the opening. When it comes out jump in the opening and find the
last secret. <BR>

<P>Warehouse - 2 secrets <BR>
1 - As you descended down the spiral stair to what you think is the bottom of
it, try jumping to the cradles and behind them there is a little red button. Shoot
it and even more stairs will appear and secret no1 is discovered. <BR>
2 -In the second last big room of the level there is a smaller room with some
windows to shoot and a button to press. If you look up at the roof in the room
you will find one of those red buttons. Well a stair comes up and you found
secret no2. <BR>
<P><a name="Unit 3">Unit 3</a> - Jail Unit

<P>Main Gate - 2 secrets<BR>
1 - After you exit the first room take a dive into the water and you will find a
secret passage under the start room. <BR>

make your way into the hole in the wall above the big white light and find secret
no2. <BR>

<P>Detention Center - 2 secrets<BR>
1 - Shoot the guy and then shoot the button. The stairs you came up on will
rise. Run around and crawl under them and collect goodies. <BR>
2 - Ok here is a tricky one. When you come to the very end of the level you can
see a room you cannot enter due to a lot of bars blocking the way in. Start with
the button closest to the end. Enter the opening and push button number two.
Then go around to the other side (farthest from the end) of it and push button
number three and enter secret no2 on the longest side. <BR>

<P>Security Complex - 1 secret<BR>
1 - At the room before the entrance to GUARD HOUSE the only secret is
located. Take a shot at the wall, enter the new opening and find the secret. <BR>

<P>Torture Chambers - 3 secrets<BR>
1 - In the beginning of the map, before you go down the long elevator to the real
action, take a trip outside and make a right. Run to the far left corner and find
secret no1. <BR>
2 - This one hurts. Down in that big tank is secret number two. <BR>
3 -At the first prison cells you will come to this tricky little secret room behind
one of the cells. So it's the one to your left if you face the corner. Take a shot
at the bottom brick and discover secret no3. <BR>

<P>Guard House - 3 secrets<BR>
1 - In the beginning after you killed the prisoners and entered the second big
room. Shoot the tanks and find a new opening. Enter and find a secret. <BR>
2 - After trying to open the broken door try crawling under it. When you have
done that do it again with the next one and find a secret. <BR>
3 - At the beginning you will eventually end up at this large yard. Push the
button to the right and the floor will lower down. <BR>

<P>Grid Control - No secrets<BR>
<P><a name="Unit 4">Unit 4</a> - Mine Unit

<P>Mine Entrance - 1 secret<BR>
1 - As you come to the bridge over the lava turn left and discover a big red
piece of wall. Shoot at it and find the ROCKET LAUNCHER! <BR>

<P>Upper Mines - 2 secrets<BR>
1 - In the same room you activate (stand on) the button to make the bridge
come out, take a close look at the far corner. Give it a shot and secret no1 will
open. <BR>
2 - It's near the "goal switch" of this level that activates the ventilation. One of
the computer banks was making sparks so I shot it. "Hmmmm how come my
shot was absorbed?" So I continued to shoot at it and voila. One quad damage.


<P>Borehole - 3 secrets<BR>
1 - In the middle of the map you enter a room by some stairs that descend into
the room in a 90 degree angle around a post. Look under the stairs for the first
secret. <BR>
2 - In the same room as secret number 1 there is a big hole with a puddle and
two openings. Jump into the puddle and dive down to the bottom for secret
number two. <BR>
3 - When you start the drill some new monsters appear. Take a look into one of
the new holes and take a shot at the wall. This will open a new corridor and
eventually an extra exit to the DRILLING AREA. 

<P>Drilling Area - 2 secrets<BR>
1 - As you enter this level from two sides this might be a little tricky to explain.
But when you enter this side you have to shoot out two red lights in the first
room to open a door to a hole. down the hole in the first corner shoot at the wall
and find secret no1. <BR>
2 - : Here is one of the lamest secrets. It's found on the very end of the map.
Jump up on the cradles. Once up on the top you have found secret no2. 

<P>Lower Mines - No Secrets

<P><a name="Unit 5">Unit 5</a> - Factory Unit

<P>Receiving Center - 4 secrets<BR>
1 - When you reach the waterfall, jump over the ledge and go through the
opening and find the first secret. <BR>
2 - Before you cross the long hanging bridge over the lava, take a look at these
three door-like things. The only one that's actually a door is the middle one.
Walk on up to it and it will automatically open for you and inside you will find
secret no4. <BR>
3 - At the very end before you enter the next level, turn around and discover a
red giveaway button on one of the red concrete supports. Go back around the
corner to the new opening and find secret no3. <BR>
4 - Hmmm, nice waterfall. Try to make an RL-jump and land behind it. It will
take you to SECRET LEVEL 2!!!!! 

<P>Sudden Death - No secrets [secret level] 

<P>Processing Plant - 3 secrets<BR>
1 - When you open one of the doors you have to press two buttons. After that
the door opens. Enter it and take a look in the hole on the left side. Jump down
and find the first secret. <BR>
2 - You are able to stop one of the conveyor belts at one time in the map. Take
a look from were its coming and find the second secret of the map.. <BR>
3 - Ok, as I found this one last it got number 3. But do it first of all. After
pressing the two buttons take a look at the roof between them. Shoot the little
red light and a secret will open just beside you. <BR>

<P><a name="Unit 6">Unit 6</a> - Power Unit/Big Gun

<P>Power Plant - 2 secrets<BR>
1 - As you entered this big room you find some of those containers that blow
when shot at stocked in one corner. Well, what are you waiting for? Shoot at
them and enter the new passage for secret no1. <BR>
2 - This is one of the harder ones. Walk forward from the start until you reach a
wall. Look to the left and you see that one of the lights are flashing. Aim
exactly at the white lamp and shoot at it. An opening will reveal itself at your
feet. 

<P>The Reactor - 1 secret 1 - From the largest room of the level you enter a
smaller new room at ground level. At the gate you can see a suspicious part of
the wall. Shoot at it and the level's only secret reveals itself. 

<P>Cooling Factory - 3 secrets + extra<BR>
1 - As you are riding your first down slope in the water stream, jump up on the
ledge and find a ladder going down. Use it and find secret no1. <BR>
2 - When you return to the water-ride you end up in a large room. Take one of
the elevators and jump down on the ledge for secret no2. <BR>
3 - After you turned the wheel, go to the boxes, turn around, and shoot the wall.
Enter and find secret no3. 

<P>Toxic Waste Dump - 2 secrets<BR>
1 - My suggestion is to take this secret after Pumping station 2. And while
you're at it also read through the next secret and do them both at the same
time. When you come to the big room from PUMP STATION 2 you have to
push a button to make a bridge over some toxic waste to the next room.
Instead go put on a suit and dive in. Get your goodies and find Secret no1. <BR>
2 - Either you can swim straight (almost) from the previous secret or you can
dive in directly in the stream going under were you started from. Inside there
will be a new suit so don't worry. 

<P>Pumping Station 1 - 3 secrets<BR>
1 - Almost at the end (Three rooms away) there is this big pipe with a large
crack in it. Jump up on the cradles and give it a shot from close range. The
crack will widen (actually blow up) and you are able to jump into the pipe. Swim
through the long tunnel inside and find secret number 1. <BR>
2 - Ok, from secret no1 you end up in this outdoor place. Give both the bars a
shot and secret no2 will open. <BR>
3 - As you return after a while to the room were you found secret no1 there is
this last strange secret. In the opposite corner of the pipe there is a yellow
light. Shoot it and the cradle to the left will blow up and last secret is found.. 

<P>Pumping Station 2 - 4 secrets<BR>
1 - When you jump down the hole in the beginning, take a look around you.
One piece of the wall really looks suspicious. Take a shot at it and find secret
no1. <BR>
2 - Ok this one hurts. Once on the map you reach a dead end (you actually
can RL-jump and continue). Look to the right and discover this long corridor
with toxic waste on the floor. Dash trough it and take a left and run some more
to safe ground where you find secret no2. But the way back will be as painful
as the way there. <BR>
3 - One of the most painful secrets. Well, at the end you have to cross this
toxic waste puddle (quite deep). Instead, dive down and discover secret no3. 
4 - This one is found at the blue door. Shoot the dig piece of wall that has the
symbol on it. It will open and you can enter, BUT; <BR>

<P>In the .BSP file; <BR>
"message" "You have found a secret." <BR>
"origin" "-1640 -1300 156" <BR>
"spawnflags" "2048" <BR>
"targetname" "t117" <BR>
"classname" "target_secret" <BR>

<P>If you go to the blue door and shoot the wall to the right of it, and jump in there
and then do a "viewpos", you'll see that you're standing right on top of the
secret. But you don't get credit for it because there's no trigger for target t117
anywhere in the .bsp file. I don't know much about quake editing but I think
that's what's going on. 
<P>So there wont be a message for you finding this last secret. But this is where it
is. 

<P>Big Gun - No secrets 

<P><a name="Unit 7">Unit 7</a> - Hangar Unit

<P>Outer Hangar - 3 secrets<BR>
1 - In the start, take a dive and shoot the propeller engine. Dive up and enter
the hole behind the propeller. Then swim trough the tunnel and find secret no1
at the end. <BR>
2 - Before you return to the start of the map with the elevator try RL-jump over
the pipe and find secret no2. <BR>
3 - After discovering secret one, continue through the door at the far end of the
large room. In there you will yourself in a big cylinder with another door
opposite to the one you entered trough. Walk in and find SECRET MAP
NUMBER 3!!! 

<P>Comm Satellite - 2 secrets [secret level]<BR>
1 - After nearly completing almost all of the first 'level' and entering the lift to the
second level, you should approach a cylinder on your left-hand side, jump down
onto it's supporting struts (avoid falling into space) and jump around clockwise
to pick up the adrenaline on picture 2. <BR>
2 - Just before the end of the map do not enter the final big room. Instead take
a look out in the darkness to your right. Down on a ledge is secret no1. 

<P>Research Lab - 1 secret + Extra<BR>
1 - When you jumped over the blood and press button 1/2 and jump back you
notice that the bars are damaged on one cell. Give it a shot (by something
powerful) and an opening reveals itself. This is the only secret of the level. <BR>
Extra - As you kill all enemies on the level go back to the start. One of the
windows (was clean when you came in) will have a text saying "KILL ME".
Shoot the glass into pieces and enter. In there you're able to crouch and enter
a small tunnel. As you exit it out in another room (picture 2) you get this
strange message; <BR>
A.H.D.S.S.I.B.H <BR>
bjjc <BR>

<P>Inner Hangar - 5 secrets<BR>
1 - In the very beginning of the map there is a large crack on some boxes. Give
the crack a shot and it will blow open. Secret no1. <BR>
2 - When you are riding the boxes in the middle of the map over the shallow
water try jumping off and take a look at the bottom of the last room. Nearest to
the ledge there is none. Take a dive and after some searching you'll find secret
no2. <BR>
3 - At the end you enter at the bottom of this very (very) deep circular hole.
Jump into the water and find a secret under the bridge. Don't forget to make a
swan dive from the top later on :) <BR>
4 - In the very end of the map there is this tricky little secret room opened by a
shot. Secret no4. <BR>
5 - This is the first time you enter a room looking like this. Get your RL loaded
and let one rip across the room. Aim for the pipe across the room. It will
explode and a quad will appear. 

<P>Launch Command - 2 secrets<BR>
1 - After you've done all objectives go to the start again. Hmmm...wonder what's
behind the launch pad. RL-jump over and take a look, get this cool message
before finding secret no1. <BR>
2 - At the end try shooting the left glass, as it did not hold, go through the
broken window and dive down to the bottom for secret no2. 

<P>Outlands - No secrets

<P><a name="Unit 8">Unit 8</a> - City Unit

<P>Outer Courts - 5 secrets<BR>
1 - As you climb around in the big outyard in the beginning you see a button
just above the door you exited from the start. Go press it and get a message. :
Well this is a big map but if you go back to the start again you will find a new
passage. Enter it and find the first secret of this excellent single player map. <BR>
2 - Down on the ground in the large outyard at the beginning in one of the caves
take a look at the wall. Then take a shot at the crack and find secret no2. <BR>
3 - After you have taken the Data Spinner, shoot in the next corner to reveal a
button. Press it and turn around. Enter, find secret no3 and press the button for
the drawbridge. <BR>
4 - After you have completed secret no3, then return to the start and climb up
to the button and beyond to the door on the wall. Enter and find secret no4. <BR>
5 - This is a bit tricky in single player. You actually have to go to the next level
to shut of the security system and then return. But after the security is shut
down, go back to the sewers in this level and in the water tunnel you will find
secret no5. 

<P>Lower Palace - 6 secrets<BR>
1 - If you are coming from the sewer entrance from OUTER COURTS you will
come to a room with some tanks. Shoot them and their explosion will open up
a secret corridor. <BR>
2 - After you disabled the laser you can go back as long as you can in secret
1. At the very end you will be able to enter a secret room with lots of good stuff.
<BR>
3 - When you are going up with the high elevator to one of the UPPER
PALACE entrances you can see a large display with yellow and red colors.
Shoot it and a secret passage will open. <BR>
4 - Remember that pillar of water or blue light or whatever it's called. Anyways,
there is a quad on top of it. In order to get it down, you have to shoot the faces
on the two walls in front and behind it. The pillar will come down and you can
collect the quad. <BR>
5 - You will find it at the second entrance to UPPER PALACE. Inside a room
you will find a panel. Try pushing the wall beside the panel and then the secret
will open. <BR>
6 - Go to the balcony (big low one) looking down at the cd-writer for the comm
laser. If you are facing the computer, take a left and there should be stairs
leading down and a quack right leading to a door. Go up the new corridor
behind the door and eventually you should enter this corridor with four blasters.
In there, there is a switch to turn off the lasers. Shoot it. You're all set... 

<P>Upper Palace - 7 secrets<BR>
1 - If you are coming from the first entrance from UPPER PALACE you
eventually will come to a very high elevator. At the top of the elevator (high one)
you go through the bar doors on the side. Then try shooting at one of the
corners up there. The wall will open and you have found your first secret. <BR>
2 - If you instead of going up like in secret no1, go down to the lowest part, you
can shoot a hole and find secret number 2. <BR>
3 - When you first encounter the four blasters popping up out of the wall, I
recommend to dive over the edge at the upper right corner so you won't land in
any of the lava. <BR>
4 - when you first enter from the lower palace (this is the entrance that brings
you to the semi-spiral staircase up to a corridor with a railing and an elevator
gong down. Down below there are a couple grunts, and a yellow forcefield. To
the left of the forcefield, and up on the ceiling there is a secret, if you stand
under it long enough a monster comes out of the ceiling (on of those cylinder
flying things) then after you kill him there is a shootable button, shoot it and a
enviro suit falls out. <BR>
5 - Nearby the two periodical flames there is this hole hidden in the darkness in
a dark corner. Just walk into the dark corner and you will automatically fall
down into secret no5. <BR>
6 - At one of the starting positions when you arrive from LOWER PALACE you
start the level looking at two doorways blocked by forcefields. Open the
forcefield on the right and step through the doorway. Shoot the ceiling and a
secret will open in front of you. <BR>
7 - Ok to get to the easter egg, after doing secret no2 where you shoot the wall
there is a puddle of green slime in the floor. In the corner there is a small stone
sticking out of the wall that you need to press up against and it will open the
wall that's under the slime. Now you can swim through the slime, ick, to a
hidden room. The room is full of things from id software's past that they try to
seal away behind the wall. Don't forget you need the red keycard (in the outer
