<P><a name="Quests"> - Quest list 

<P>Remember, you will not get all of these quests in one game! What quests you will recieve in the game is randomly played out by Diablo; you have no choice as to what quests you will be confronted with. 

<P>Butcher
Quest Given From: the Wounded Townsman
Quest Summary: First find the room with the Butcher in it. It should be a room on Level 2 with many slain bodies inside. If you are a Warrior, obtain a shield, a sword, some leather armor,
and many healing potions on your belt. Open the door and let him come to you. When he gets close to you, try to get off the first hit. With luck, you should be able to pummel him to
death with your sword while taking minimal damage. If you are a Rogue, open the door and run back. Hit and run while firing arrows into him until he dies. If you are a Sorcerer, open the
door and make sure he sees you. Cast a Flame Wall spell in his chamber, then shut the door. He should succumb to the flames. After he dies, pick up the Butcher's Cleaver, a unique
item. 

<P>Poisoned Water

Quest Given From: Pepin
Quest Summary: When you hit Level 2 of the dungeon, come back to town and talk to Pepin. He should tell you that he water of Tristram is going bad, and that it's up to you to figure out
what is going on before people become sick and die. Go back to Level 2 and look for a hole in the wall surrounded by candles. When you find this hole (move the cursor over it and it
should say 'Dark Passage') enter it. Inside you should find Goatmen, Dark Ones, and other enemies. Defeat all the enemies in the Dark Passage, and the quest will be solved. Return to Pepin and he will give you the Ring of Truth as your reward. 

<P>Ogden's Sign
Quest Given From: Ogden
Quest Summary: When Ogden informs you that his sign to his tavern is missing, go down to Level 4 and search for a Dark One named Snotspill. He will inform you that some 'big uglies' stole his sign, and that he wants it back. Search around Level 4 for a room with many Overlords and a chest inside. Open the chest to retrieve Ogden's sign. From this point, you can solve the quest via two methods. The first is to give the sign back to Snotspill. He will say that he can now cast great magic, and will ambush you with Overlords. Or, you can go give Ogden back his sign and get a magical item as a reward. 

<P>Garbad the Weak
Quest Given From: Garbad the Weak
Quest Summary: Venture into Level 4, and you will meet Garbad the Weak. He will tell you that if you protect him from the enemies in the dungeon, he will give you a great reward. After
he tells you this, go off somewhere else besides Level 4. Return to him and receive an item. At this time he will tell you that he is still crafting your reward, and will give you some item to
hold you over until then. Leave Level 4 and return to Garbad a second time, and he will tell you that he is almost done. Leave again and return to Garbad, and he will say that he has
finished the item, but you must fight him for it. He is easy to kill, and when you do, pick up the random item he was making. 

<P>Valor Armor
Quest Given From: Book
Quest Summary: In Level 5 of the catacombs you will find a book which will speak of the warrior Arkaine, and will tell that his armor called Valor resides somewhere in the Catacombs.
Search the catacombs for a blood altar and three blood stones. Pick up all three blood stones and place them in the blood altar (just click on the altar once to place a stone). When this is done, a wall will disappear and a great hall will be before you. Continue down the hall, killing all enemies in your way. At the end of the hallway you will find Arkaine's Valor Armor. 

<P>Magic Rock
Quest Given From: Griswold
Quest Summary: After you enter the catacombs, return to town and talk to Griswold. He will speak of the Magic Rock which he has heard of. If you return it to him, he will give you a
reward. Return to the catacombs and search for the Magic Rock. Once you find it, return it to Griswold and receive the Empyrean Band. 

<P>Halls of the Blind
Quest Given From: Book
Quest Summary: Read this book to recite a poem about the Halls of the Blind. After you read it through, you will be able to access a room which you couldn't access before. Enter the
room and search one of the adjacent rooms for the Optic Amulet. Once you find it, this quest has been completed. 

<P>Black Mushroom
Quest Given From: Adria
Quest Summary: Search the caverns for a Fungal Tome. Once you find it, go to town and talk to Adria. She will tell you that in order to make use of it, she will need a Black Mushroom.
Return to the caves and search for a patch of mushrooms within. Take the Black Mushroom and return to Adria with it. She will say that she now needs an elixir from Pepin. Ask Pepin for the elixir, and he will say that he will need a demon's brain to create such an elixir. Return to the caves and kill any demon. His brain will pop out. Grab it and return to Pepin for the elixir. Go back to Adria with the elixir, and she will say that she does not need it any more. Drink the elixir to raise your all your base stats by three. 

<P>Anvil of Fury
Quest Given From: Griswold
Quest Summary: After you enter deep into the caves, return to town and talk to Griswold. He will speak of the Anvil of Fury which he has heard of, and will tell you that if he has this anvil,
he can craft you a truly powerful weapon. On Level 10 of the caves, out on a peninsula of land which stretches into the lava, you will find the Anvil of Fury. Get it and return to Griswold for
Griswold's Edge, a very good sword. 

<P>Warlord of Blood
Quest Given From: Book
Quest Summary: Later in the game you will find a Steel Tomb that talks about the Warlord of Blood. Proceed down to Level 13 to find him. He will be in a room guarding the entrance down to Level 14 along with a few other Blood Knights. To kill him easily, lure out each of his escort Blood Knights one by one. With time and patience, you should be able to lure most of them out without provoking the Warlord to come after you. When you feel that you are ready, get close to him and retreat. He should follow you. Exit the room which he is in to give yourself some space, then fight him to the death. After you kill him, enter back into the room he was in to get some cool armor and weapons. When you have collected all the items that you want, go on down to Level 14. 

<P>Zhar the Mad
Quest Given From: Zhar the Mad
Quest Summary: In Level 8 of the catacombs, you should encounter Zhar the Mad in a library. Talk to him, and he will give you a book to keep you busy while he goes about his work.
Take the book and all the scrolls around you, but do not take the book from the bookcase. When you feel you are ready to fight him, take the book from the bookcase. Zhar will get mad that you have done this, and will fight you. He will teleport around the room and shoot fireballs with his staff, making him very hard to get a hit on him without being hurt yourself. To make this much easier, Stone Curse him when he is visible to get some easy hits on him. One or two Stone Curse spells, and he should be dead for sure. 

<P>Lachdanan
Quest Given From: Lachdanan
Quest Summary: Find Lachdanan on Level 14 and talk to him. He will not attack you, and will explain his story of how he was once one of King Leoric's Knights until a curse came upon
him. He is the only one of the Blood Knights which has stood the curse and kept his sanity, and requests that you find him a golden potion so he can end his life without being eternally
damned. Head down to Level 15 and search for this potion. Once you find it, return to Lachdanan and give it to him. He will give you give you the Veil of Steel and, after he kills himself, he will drop a magical item for your use. 

<P>Skeleton King
Quest Given From: Book
Quest Summary: Enter his tomb on the third level. Within the tomb you should kill all the enemies, then approach the two levers. Switch the lever on the left (east room) to open a door to
a room with a couple of chests. Check the chests for useful items inside. Once you do that, go back and switch the lever on the right (west room) to open the way to the Skeleton King.
Try to get to the Skeleton King as quickly as possible to kill him, for he will resurrect other skeletons if you attack them first. Holy Bolt works nicely on him, and hand to hand combat with
him could prove to be fatal. 

<P>Archbishop Lazarus
Quest Given From: Cain
Quest Summary: Search Level 15 until you find the Staff of Lazarus. Once you find it, pick it up and head back to town with it. Talk to Cain, and he will notice the owner of the staff and
explain to you how Lazarus must be killed at this point of time. He will take the staff from you and send you on your way. Head back down to Level 15 and you will find a red portal near the marble pentagram. Enter the portal to enter Lazarus' lair. Once you enter his lair, proceed to go through it killing all the Hell Spawns and other enemies you find. Once you have cleared out all the enemies you can find, go search for a gray circle on the ground (there should be two or three). Enter it, and you will be in an area where some Hell Spawns were. Enter the other gray circle, and you should be in another area where Hell Spawns were. Now retreat to where you started the level at. A third gray circle should be on the ground. Enter it to go straight to Lazarus. After the cut scene of him, you should start off in a room with Lazarus and many Hell Spawns. Lazarus will be talking, and the Hell Spawns will just be sitting there. Take this point in time to run down the hall. When he is done talking, the Hell Spawns will come after you little by little. Kill them off until only Lazarus is left. Find Lazarus, and kill him to complete the quest. Stone Curse works nicely on him if you can't get him to hold still... 

<P>Diablo
Quest Given From: Cain
Quest Summary: After you have killed Lazarus, head back to Cain in town. He will now tell you of the quest of Diablo, Lord of Terror. Retreat back down to Level 15, and walk into the
pentagram to enter his lair. To make this level very simple, fight your way down to the lower-left hand corner of the map. There you should find an enclosed room, with many enemies and monsters scattered around it. Kill them all, and ready a spell or scroll of Telekinesis. Inside the room you should be able to see two levers. Both must be pulled in order to open the room with Diablo in it. Use Telekinesis to pull them both. Then head down to the lower-right hand corner of the level. You should find Diablo there along with many other enemies. Try to lure just Diablo out of the room. Once you do, lead him to some other part of the level away from all other monsters. Once it's just you and him, go in for the kill. 

<P><a name="shrines"> Shrine Guide </a>

<P>Abandoned Shrine:
Go for it, +2 dex, no penalty. Creepy Shrine: Go for it, +2 str, no penalty. 

<P>Cryptic: 
Full mana ball, useful. If you're surrounded in a corridor and you have telekinesis, you can also wipe out a ton of enemies that way from the Nova. 

<P>Divine: 
Gives you free potions, use it :) 

<P>Eerie: 
Despite the message, it's +2 to Magic with no penalities. 

<P>Eldritch: 
Before using it, go to town and buy as many regular/full healing potions as you can. Then use the shrine. They'll all become Rejuvenation potions. If you don't want to use them, you can sell them for 70 gold profit on the regular, and 100 (I think) gold profit on the fulls. 

<P>Enchanted:
Unless you've only got one or two spells, use it. It's easy to recover one spell level for one particular spell, it's hard to gain a level for 10+ spells. Very nice for Sorcerers and Rogues. 

<P>Fascinating Shrine: 
Avoid like the Plague. The +2 spell level isn't worth the permanent Mana loss. 

<P>Glimmering Shrine: 
Use, but beforehand, have everyone in your party give all their unidentified equipment to you. 

<P>Gloomy: 
Have everyone give you their armor, but drop all weapons before use. 

<P>Hidden: 
Unless you've got very low durability equipment you don't want to accidentally weaken, use it. Also, if you want to make a specific item stronger, drop everything but that item and a
generic item found on the floor. 50/50 chance you'll get lucky (very useful with a Thinking Cap). 

<P>Holy: 
Your choice, it really doesn't matter (it's only like casting phasing). 

<P>Magical: 
If you're a warrior or a rogue with low magic, it may not be worth it. If you're a high level Rogue or Sorcerer, go for it. 

<P>Mysterious: 
It's your choice. Personally, I avoid all the shrines that lower stats, even if they do raise one or more. 

<P>Ornate: 
Avoid. Holy Bolt's easy enough to raise levels, but the mana loss is permanent. 

<P>Quiet: 
Unless someone else in your party needs it badly, use it. +2 to vitality, no penalities. 

<P>Religious: 
Before using it, have everyone give you their weapons to repair. 

<P>Sacred: 
Avoid as well, as the spell levels aren't worth the mana loss. 

<P>Secluded: 
Sure, a full map's always worth having (even if you can't tell where you haven't been yet anymore). 

<P>Spiritual: 
If you're low on money, empty your pockets before using. If you're rich enough, you can just ignore it (it's usually only around 700 gold). 

<P>Spooky: 
If you can, have someone else use the shrine so you get potions ;) Always worth using. 

<P>Stone: 
Useless unless you have staves. If more than one person has them, empty the staff before using, and give all of them to one person, who uses the shrine. 

<P>Tainted: 
From my experience, people hate it when their stats change without their prior approval, and this shrine'll do that. Ask before using (I usually avoid using it). 

<P>Weird: 
Have everyone give the user of the shrine their weapons before using it. 

<P>Blood Fountain/Purifying Spring:
Sure, use it all you want. It's unlimited use, free Health/Mana recovery. 

<P>Fountain of Tears:
It's your choice, but I always avoid the shrines/objects that lower my stats and raise others. 

<P>Goat Shrine/Cauldron:
Once again, personal choice. I think it's too risky, although 9 out of 10 times I use a Goat Shrine, I got Mana Shield. Choose for yourself.
