He procs a nasty knockback and runs really fast. Killed our ranger on the pull before he could get to us. He drops a decent 18/30 1h blunt that procs knockback. <A HREF="#" onMouseDown="Horn()";>Here</A> is a pic of the horn wielded by our Troll warrior, Nezak. Also added pics of Honvar and Quoza. Only missing Nyga and Myga images now.

	 <TD><h1 style="{color:white;font-size:13pt;}">Dragon Info Updated - September 11, 2001</h1><p style="{color:white;}">Updated info and images on a lot of dragons including: Klandicar, Sontalak, Linbrak, Myga, Nyga, Zil Sapara, Del Sapara, Mav Sapara, Sivar and a few others. I'm only missing images of a few dragons now. I know Honvar and Quoza have the Severilous graphic, but I have no image of them. I don't have an image of Zil Sapara either, but I'm 99% sure it has a Vox graphic, or maybe it was adopted and doesn't look like the other Sapara's.

Click <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=5347.topic&start=1&stop=10" target=_blank>here</a> to visit the original post. Great work by Celandro and other people in the thread. Some info is missing. I know we've got gloves and helms to drop in WW, but I can't remember who dropped them.</p>

	 <TD><h1 style="{color:white;font-size:13pt;}">Updated Dragons - May 14, 2001</h1><p style="{color:white;}">Added info on Nintal and Tsiraka, added placeholder links for some dragons that I know exist, but have never seen (Del Sapara, Zil Sapara, Frakadar, Linbrak and Nyga), or have no real info on (Klandicar).<BR>*Edit* Frakadar does not exist. He was a victim of Zlandicar, and Zlandicar occasionally drops Frakadar's Talisman, which can be turned in to Harla Dar for some neato item. This is a CoV faction quest, though, so some fruity dragon lover will have to complete this one.</p>

	 <TD><h1 style="{color:white;font-size:13pt;}">Updated Layout - May 11, 2001</h1><p style="{color:white;}">Added some info on Draazak, Entariz and Onava. Info on Draazak and Onava is sketchy because we've never fought them, yet. Derasinal kinda has to die in order to get Draazak alone I think, and Derasinal always either gates on us, or Rak Sapara stumbles upon us when we fight Derasinal. So, Derasinal has yet to die to us. Which is kinda sad, because he is quite the wussy. Onava is just rare I think, I've seen him twice, but never when we were raiding WW. Still need info on Zil Sapara, Del Sapara, Frakadar, Linbrak and Nyga. I have never even seen any of them, yet though.</p>

I still need info/screenshots of: Onava, Entariz, Del Sapara, Zil Sapara, Frakadar, Draazak, Linbrak and Nyga.<BR>Also, another fantastic <A HREF="#" onMouseDown="kiting()"; return false>pic</A> of me kiting, this time 5 dragons (Vraptin, Bufa, Jen Sapara, Pantrilla and Atpaev). I was running them off so people could camp out, then I went out with a <A HREF="#" onMouseDown="damage()"; return false>bang</A>. Jen Sapara did no melee damage, she thought it would be wiser to nuke me for 40 damage than to melee me.</p>

I spent a long time on this, so I hope you like it. I will leave the old menu system in place, which can be accessed from the menu on the left. Currently, the new menu will not work in Netscape cause Netscape sucks. Go get IE. To access the new menu, click <A HREF="WWDragons2.htm">here</A> or click on Dragons on the left menu. If you insist on fighting Microsoft and use Netscape instead, use the Old Dragons List link on the left.<BR>There are still several dragons that I need info and pics of, they are: Del Sapara, Rak Sapara, Zil Sapara, Tantor (ok so Tantor isn't a dragon), Cargalia,
      Nyga, Drazzal and probably a few others. Some of these I already have info on, but no pic (like Cargalia and Drazzal). If anyone has pics of any of these, please send them to me <A HREF="mailto:tom@tom-wallace.com">here</A><P></TD>
