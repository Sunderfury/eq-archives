As far as soloing, I managed to do it at level 31. Took forever. No mana several times. Had sow recast by an amused druid watching me try it. At 34, its very doable with a good pet. However, you will lose the pet occasionally and have to run for zone/feign. At 39, they become easy, and holding multiple spawns is not that difficult. I know people that have made literally 20k off of them. <P>On the other hand, I get easily bored, and these guys are boring to tears. ugly fat woman running towards you. Slow running, feared running, poisoned, feared again. One dead chubby woman on the ground. Lacks the thrill of lower guk/sol a/sol b/mistmoore/etc. <P>Oh the faction you lose is dwarven citizen which does not affect guards for all you gnomes/humans/erudites(all the weak races concerned with being liked by others, unlike the superior dark elven race)  :P<BR><P>------------------<BR>Darkmoon Somberlight<P>"Whenever I walk upon Norrath, Peace is curled up in a fetal position, whimpering"</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fyreblayd</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Corrupt a doggie???<BR>Who do you think is monopolising the dwarf spawns as it is?  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqnecro.com/noncgi/biggrin.gif"><P>I think we should report the 'bug' where doggie sty..oops form makes them NON-kos to surrounding dwarves regardless how many dwarves they rape. THAT is serious UNbalance!<P>But anyway, I was camping the docks so fear wasn't really an option. Guess I got the 'resister'  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqnecro.com/noncgi/smile.gif"><P>Excellent experience. Got 1/3 a bubb soloing while my group decided to follow the troll the LONG way fro0m the druid circle to the docks while I just ran up to the ocean, followed the shore, and eipped around the wall (becareful, there are 2 spawns here you run risk of aggroing).<P>We get there, and some doggie comes up and says the one on the left docks was his. I asked if the 2 on the other side were not enough, and he said no he can take 3 BAH!<P>But to his credit, he did share the spawn, and was hunting the Hut and the left dock spawn (the right dock spawn is a much faster respawn, so he didn't want it) and we had 3 spawns to ourselves.<P>Grouped, the cash was better than the XP. <P>------------------<BR>In Life there is Death.
