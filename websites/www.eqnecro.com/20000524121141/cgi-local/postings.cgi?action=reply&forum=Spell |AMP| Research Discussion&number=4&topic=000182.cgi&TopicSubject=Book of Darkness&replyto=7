How high should I be to solo these Magicians and how often do they drop the book ?<P>Thank you for your help.<P>Anglagard</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Innerlight</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The tower in Lake Rathe has a mage with earth pet and a wizard.  They spawn pretty fast.  The mage has around 400hp and the wizard around 300.  Soloing them is tough though because they are hard to interrupt and the spells the use hit hard.  The wizard stops giving exp at level 28 but the mage is a little higher.  These were pretty good exp from 26 to 28 though.  I camped this spot with a ranger and at level 26 we had little problem.  Use harmony to break the spawn.  Pull the mage and her pet then kill the mage fast.  After that I terrored the pet to erase the ranger from its list.  Then I attacked it and feigned death to get it to suicide.  Then run into the tower and kill the wizard.  Now med and heal.  If you did this correctly you have them broken up and from now on you can camp inside the tower and kill them as they spawn (no pet) easily.  The book drops off the mage and is very common.  I would say you get it 1 out of every 2 on average.  Btw, no heretic faction for killing these :-(  Oh well.<P>When could you solo them?  Hhhmm.  You might be able to do it at 29 but it would be risky.  I would try to send pet in after the mage.  Streaming terror the Wizard.  Now if the mage pet is after you terror or fear it.  If not then just Shock of Poison the mage.  With pet hitting her 2 Shock of Poisons might be enough to finish her.  Now leave the pets to fight and take out the wizard.  At 29 you will resist his spell a lot (I did a 28) and 2 SoP should take him.  Then help your pet take her pet and the spawn will be your.  It sounds easy but 3 or 4 blasts from the mage will easily kill you if you don't resist them so be careful.<P>Adidos,<BR>Flec</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nergal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You CAN solo this tower at 24.  Screaming Terror one, sick your pet on the mage pet (alternately, fear the mage pet), and nuke the other with SoP.  I wouldn't suggest it though.  In the best case scenario, its extremely painful (I finished with 1 bubble of health and oom), and the risk of death is very high.  I tried it once just to see if I could, got cocky and died 2 times trying to repeat it.<P>Came back with a buddy necro (also 24) and the tower was cake.  You'll take some hits and may have to feign, but you should easily take them down.  They have very low HPs.<P>The book however, will drop of either caster and is far from a common drop.  We had to clear the tower 11 times to get my book.  Then had 3 books drop in the next 5 spawns.  We were shouting for people to come get them before they decayed. <IMG SRC="http://www.eqnecro.com/noncgi/smile.gif"><P>Of all the books for the Words of Darkness, this is the easiest to get.  I'm guessing the above caster is correct that at 29 you could easily punk both these guys.<P>FYI: at 24 in a duo they are EXCEPTIONAL xp.<P>--Nergal<p>[This message has been edited by Nergal (edited 02-23-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Innerlight</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">As I said above I think this is a great camp spot for any level 25is team (pair).  It is rarely camped and they have vey few hp.  I am very imrpessed with Nergal taking the tower solo at 24.  I tried this myself at 26 and died horribly since the mage was able to kill me with only 3 spells (even with my leather skin on).  I Terrored the wizard and got hit by the first mage dd.  Then my pet was attacking the mage and her pet was on me so I terrored her pet.  2nd hit from the mage dd.  I cast SoP and hit her and then got hit by the last dd which killed me.  She still had 60% health.  Ouch.  But at 29 it would be much easier because at 28 I resisted the wizard spell a majority of the time and I resist the mage dd a few times as well.<BR>  But as Nergal said, this is an good spawn with a partner and the exp is great up until 28 when you stop getting exp for the wizard.  I am not sure when you camped them Nergal so things may have changed, but I was there with my ranger friend from level 26 to 28 (which was about 3 to 4 weeks ago) and we killed these 2 a LOT.  I never once saw the book drop off the wizard.  And the mage left the book about 1 out of every 2 or 3 mage kills.  They also left golden earrings everytime (on both casters) which sold for 8gp.  And the occasional rune and word.<P>Hope this helps,<BR>Adidos,<BR>Flec</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darkstorm</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Umm, I beg to differ with the last post. The Book ONLY drops from the mage.  I can say this becuase I went from level 25 to level 28 at this tower. Never once in almost 500 kills did the Wizard drop the book. As for it being a rare drop Bah it dropped often. SO many times in fact that everone in the zone that needed it got it.  Don't let this guy scare you off this book is NOT rare.  But also don't let him fool you into thinking that these casters are easy.<BR>These guys are all but impossible to interrupt.  The mage is simply a pain in the ass she hits for 50's, her spells can take a necro owt in about 3 shots, OH did I mention you Will NOT interuppt her!<BR>As for the post above if you took them both Solo at 24 you got really really lucky becuase I know how hard this mage casts and how fast that pet comes flying out to you. You Simply do not have the time to terror the wizzy, the mage pet and cast on the mage 3 times before she sends you into orbit with that DD spell.<BR>Just my 2 copper<P>Kaymen Darkwater<BR>30th Ranger of Tunare<BR>Tribunal<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nergal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sorry, I never meant to imply that it was easy at 24...nonononono.
