Then, somewhere around level 4 or so, it'll even out and you'll be about the same.  Somewhere around level 8 you'll pretty much only step into combat to tank for your pet who is low on health.  That's still pretty important though.  <P>As for weapon choice, it depends on what is available to you. I think weapons like the crystal staves are quite good for low level necros, as is the runed totem staff if you prefer two handed weapons.  <P>Smidge</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aenia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">They don't have 2 Steins of Moggok, those are Lore.

Besides, I hit for around 19, which isn't at all too bad for a lvl 17 caster  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqnecro.com/noncgi/smile.gif">  If you are going to keep a weapon as a back-up, make sure its 1h...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dasmythe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sacrificial Dagger is nice .. a halfway decent piercing weapon that adds INT.

I haven't seen one for sale.  Its defianlty not worth melee'ing after lv 20.  You will do more damage with spells or medding mana.  I was grouped with a wiz once in my 20s that when he went oom would go in and try to melee in a group.  He should have been medding insteadna nd would have done a hell of a lot more damage with just one nuke.  Earlier though you had to melee or your pet would die.  At 20+ you will get inturpted too much trying to lifetap and if you did a lot of damage the pet won't be able to taunt off. It is important to keep your defense up.  I have mine maxed at lv 41 (just got 42).</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Vlane</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Oberan,<P>Speaking of Defense, what is our max per level on that?

Its a real pain in the arse trying to take hits from something blue to a 40+ for very long, and those points come pretty slow anyway, for my stupid dorf anyway.<P>My hot ticket for scoring defense points is a good train. Stand by the zone in cazic or kedge (casters in mm and unrest make it hard there) and take hits as long as you can, zone, rinse, repeat. I guess being able to heal yourself would be pretty crucial to that strategy's success though.<P>------------------<BR><B>Wynona Jugg</B> - lvl 42 Dwarven Cleric<BR><B>Natasa</B> - lvl 16 Drow Necro<BR><I>Mith Marr</I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gimble</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">No way! It's all about 1handed blunt, so you can snag that orb of tishan from naggy's teeth!<P>heh, that thing would ROCK for necro's.  Think i'll see if my channelling crystal would trade for one =P~~  Then i'd have the double fisted apple look too, be kinda nifty.<P>But seriously, the Orb of Tishan would rule for necros.
