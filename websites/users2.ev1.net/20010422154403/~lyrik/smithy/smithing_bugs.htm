<p align="center"><strong><font color="#FFFF80" size="4" face="Tempus Sans ITC"><u>List
of known bugs in EQ smithing</u></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFCC99">1. No known way to enchant MQ ore found (breaks enchanted seafarer recipes).<br>
2. Field Plate Boots reported as broken.<br>
3. Jade reported to be not working on Northman ring armor (affects making
Northman Chain for Rallos Zek).<br>
4. Normal Ogre Splint does not allow Ogres/Trolls to use.<br>
5. No known working recipe for Elven Chain boots (should use 2 rings, but
doesn't).<br>
6. Dwarven Smithy Hammer lost when making non-enchanted Brellium Chain Jointing.<br>
7. Iron Oxide (EQMerchant) - only 1 resin version of this dye works.<br>
8. Russet Oxide (EQMerchant) - only 1 resin version of this dye works.<br>
9. Permafrost Crystals (EQTraders) - 1 resin blue version doesn't seem to show
up on BP (and possibly other armor pieces.<br>
10. Large Fine Plate Visor - Recipe appears to be broken...does not work with
one sheet like other fp visor recipes.<br>
11. Forges in Halas are reported as being broken for dying armor...person
reporting this stated that they were making 1 resin blue fine plate pauldron.&nbsp;
They did the same thing in Freeport and it worked fine.&nbsp; Person was sure
they were not using the cultural forge (reported by Brazarg on KC's Realm).</font></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font color="#FFFF80" size="4" face="Tempus Sans ITC"><u>Is
this working as intended?</u></font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFCC99">1. Followers of Erollisi Marr require a 1p Star Rose Quartz to imbue their
armor...Followers of Mithaniel Marr require a 1000p gem (diamond) for
theirs...stats are not on par with gem cost (diamond also has to be dropped by
mobs...part of why it's so expensive).<br>
2. Large leather belt not available on Halas leather armor vendor...has a
leather kilt instead (makes Northman Chain Belt hard to make...closest available
vendor is South Qeynos)</font><br>
</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFCC99">3.
Large leather gorget not available on Halas leather armor vendor or South Qeynos
leather armor vendor (makes Northman Chain Gorget hard to make...closest
available vendor is Grobb/Oggok)</font></span><font color="#FFCC99"><span style="background-color: #FFCC99"><br>
</span>4. Imbued Dwarven Plate recipes do not work (enchanted imbued dwarven plate does
work)...makes Enchanters (non-dwarven class) absolutely necessary to make
magical dwarven plate (doesn't make much RP sense to me).</font></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFF80"><u><b><span style="background-color: #000000">Fixed
bugs</span></b></u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFCC99">1. No large leather boots on
vendors (breaks Ogre Splint)<br>
</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFF80">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These can
be found on various boot-only vendors around Norrath.</font></p>
