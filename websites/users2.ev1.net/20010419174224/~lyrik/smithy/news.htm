- Looooong time since the last update</font></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 60"><font color="#FFFF99" size="3" face="Tempus Sans ITC">Hehe...I
do still work on this spreadsheet =)&nbsp; Sometimes I stealth update it...going
to try and be more diligent about modifying the version number of the
spreadsheet.&nbsp; Renamed the file to reflect the current version.&nbsp; Added
lots of new pics and books...completely fixed the Bowcrafting page.&nbsp; Added
all the new Velious tailoring stuff I could find...plus many many more
updates.&nbsp; Grab it and have a look.</font></p>

- The New Year</font></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 60"><font color="#FFFF99" size="3" face="Tempus Sans ITC">Whoot!&nbsp;
The new year is here...it can only go up from here =)&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp;
Well...I've gone through and gotten a *LOT* of screenshots and put in hyperlinks
in the spreadsheet so that you can actually see the items...should help a lot of
you getting started.&nbsp; It also shows you that an item in question actually
*DID* exist in the game at one point.&nbsp; All in all...I think it's a good
addition.&nbsp; I'm always accepting screenshots for new items.&nbsp; If you do,
please do it in the .JPG format...also cut and paste a pic of the item as it
appears in your inventory on the upper right hand side.&nbsp; Microsoft Paint is
great for this!&nbsp; You can get to it by going to START-&gt;PROGRAMS-&gt;ACESSORIES-&gt;PAINT.&nbsp;
Prices are still messed up in all of the spreadsheet, but I fixed a lot of the
sheets (Tailoring got a second sheet for cultural tailoring) and the Alchemy
sheet is looking pretty much like I want it to.</font></p>

- Scars of Vellious</font></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 60"><font color="#FFFF99" size="3" face="Tempus Sans ITC">Well...looks like a lot of new trade skill stuff...is this stuff gonna slow down so I can get my spreadsheet up to date?  God, I hope not =)  Well, I've got preliminary spaces on the Jewelcrafting sheet for the new vellium that you will be able to make new pieces of jewelry with.  I wonder if this stuff is going to melt if you take it off of the continent of Vellious...I guess the pitiful screams of those who come back to Antonica with their pieces will tell us.  Looks like there's some new tailoring stuff being talked about...Wyvernhide leather and some sort of Wurmhide leather I think =)  Just saw it in passing.</font></p>

- New patch</font></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 60"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="3">Wow...the new patch really fixed my gamma!  I play a dark elf with the best vision in the game and I could barely see in front of my face in zones like Feerrott at night.  Wheeee... Anyway, looks like HQ and MQ rings now require their respective ores to create and Ornate Chain is now player creatable...however it's not that good...1ac better than banded and about half a pound lighter.  Hopefully it can be dyed.  I had thought it was going to be caster wearable (about the only reason to make this stuff considering the cost and trouble of getting HQ ore).  The spreadsheet has been updated with the current smithing stuff...new item screenshot hyperlinks have been added...and I have tables on the tailoring sheet for the new cultural wood elf and halfling leather armors.  Unfortunately, they all look broken at the moment.  Nothing has been found on the Erudite tailoring upgrade.</font></p>

- Welcome to my web page</font></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 60"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="3" color="#FFFF99">This is
my first attempt to make a web page, so please be patient with me
=). I created this place for two reasons. One was to give a place
where all trades people in EQ could share my spreadsheet. I have
been working on it for a few months and am pretty proud of
it...hehe. It still has a way to go, but it is very useful. I
would appreciate a note for anything on it that is factually
incorrect. I have tried really hard to keep it up-to-date and
correct, but it ain't easy =). The second reason I made this is
because my favorite site for blacksmithing (KC's Realm) has not
been touched in months and the message board software he was
using *cough*sucks*cough*. I also wanted a messageboard that was
more conducive to experimentation and for getting information
around to other smiths. I might be making similar pages for the
other skills, but I will never combine it with this one...I want
to preserve the individuality and don't want to homogenize it so
that it is simply a messageboard for all trade skills. Also...on
the ezboard...if you click on the pictures I have used on all the
messageboards, there are links to the source of the picture. In
some cases you can *buy* these items from the site. I don't get
any money for this...just thought it was kinda cool =)</font><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
