                We want this guild to be fun but still functions as maturely as 
                possible. Insulting persons for RolePlaying uses is acceptable 
                but do not direct any of them at the player, only his character.

                The command /annoymous should only be used in cases of extreme 
                harrassment, undercover work, and enchanter illusion spells. This 
                command will remove your guild tag. Using /roleplay should be 
                used for things like moving the guild from zone to zone and for 
                battles. Generally leave /roleplay turned off the remainder of 
                the time because it prevents the /who all Guild from functioning. 
                Hopefully Verant will fix this problem in the future. If this 
                happens the entire guild shall move to /roleplay.</font></p>
