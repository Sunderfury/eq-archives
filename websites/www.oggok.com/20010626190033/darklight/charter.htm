                        story of the three and the founding of the war began with 
                        the coming of nightfall, and with it a great darkness. 
                        Black clouds filled the skys over Antonica, cutting off 
                        what little light the moon and stars could afford. But 
                        the darkness was more than just the shadows of clouds 
                        for the flickering of torches could not penetrate far 
                        into the night's embrace and even magic seemed less effect 
                        against it. A great wind began to howl, accompanied by 
                        thunder and lighting, yet the storm brought with it no 
                        rain for it was not the work of Karana. Some began to 
                        stir in Norrath that night, a feeling that all could sense. 
                        Good, evil, and even the indifferent.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                        first was called from the swamps in the lower regions 
                        of Norrath. A troll hunter of renowned prowess and battle 
                        skill. The dark wind found him unable to sleep, something 
                        in the back of his mind pulling at his consciousness calling 
                        him deep into the swamp. Something was waiting for him, 
                        what it was he did know. Abandoning his home he set out 
                        for this unknown. Far into the darkened swamp he did travel, 
                        so far that the terrain became unfamiliar to him yet the 
                        call pulled him deeper and deeper. Abruptly the troll 
                        stoped, standing at the edge of a murky pool. The wind 
                        danced on the surface of the water causing it to churn 
                        violently and something else as well. Slowly a figure 
                        rose from its depths. The troll dropped to his knees, 
                        knowing the embodiment of his deity and creator, the Faceless 
                        One, stood before him. The dark avatar reached out a hand, 
                        beckoning the troll to approach. The warrior had served 
                        his lord all his life and did not hesitate to once again 
                        follow his bidding. Something changed though, the water 
                        around the troll's legs began to thicken as he walked, 
                        soon he was unable to move his feet. The more he struggled, 
                        the tighter the liquid's grasp became. Then it began to 
                        make its way up the troll's body, its thick black tentacles 
                        wrapping around his arms and chest. As the fluid constricted 
                        around his throat the troll looked up to see the emotionless 
                        face of Cazic Thule and he attempted to cry out, but there 
                        was no air left in his lungs to scream. Then life gave 
                        way to death.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                        dark wind howled as it moved ever farther, spreading north 
                        across all of Norrath. A jungle, this one's inhabitants 
                        larger even than the trolls. It was here the second was 
                        called, a lone ogre, his hands stained with the blood 
                        of many light-dwellers. He was a student of history, one 
                        of very few who kept the old ways. A warrior who knew 
                        of his past and where his people came from. As he felt 
                        the wind's touch, something in his soul told him destiny 
                        was nigh. Looking out into the jungle, he began to run. 
                        To run down many pathes he had never seen before, being 
                        drawn away from the safety of his home. As he ran, the 
                        Ogre began to feel more like the prey than the hunter. 
                        As he neared the extent of his stamina and will power 
                        something stirred in the darkness. At first the Ogre saw 
                        nothing more few large trees. Slowly the realization came 
                        over him that the object was not a group of trees, but 
                        the silhouetted legs of a larger being, taller than the 
                        ogre, taller even than the giants. The Ogre felt immense 
                        power and, for the first time in his life, great fear. 
                        Before him stood the Great Warlord, Rallos Zek. The Ogre 
                        was so struct with awe at seeing the father of his race 
                        that his muslces froze in place. The figure stretched 
                        one mighty hand and, with a single crushing blow, the 
                        ogre was knocked to the ground in death.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                        wind blew on, meeting its final distention far to the 
                        north in a forest already thought haunted by many. In 
                        the shadows of a tall tree knelt a dark elf. He was a 
                        priest of unquestionable faith and loyalty. In silence 
                        he meditated, listening to the dark night, knowing that 
                        things beyond the normal were taking place. Dread filled 
                        his heart as he reflected on the omens he had bore witness 
                        to in his dreams the past four nights. He was pulled from 
                        his trance by a flash of light, a small floating bauble 
                        that glowed blue in color. After a moment, almost as if 
                        waiting just long enough to catch the dark elf's curiosity, 
                        it began to move away. Quickly and quietly he jumped to 
                        hs feet and gave chase. At first he was careful to not 
                        make any sounds as he moved, but the floating light moved 
                        faster and faster from before him. It did not take long 
                        before he was forced to give up all stealth and secrecy 
                        to run so that it would not move out of sight. Hours passed, 
                        yet the dark elf was so enthralled by the sphere that 
                        he did not stop in his pursuit. Eventually the globe stopped 
                        moving forward and began to ascend high into the air. 
                        The darkelf fell back and covered his eyes when the glowing 
                        ball flashes bright as day. Quickly it faded back to a 
                        glow again, revealing itself to be a staff in the hand 
                        of the Prince of Hatred. The preist stood motionless, 
                        unsure if he should kneel or run away as fast as his feet 
                        could move. The decision was made for him as the entity 
                        pointed one finger at the darkelf's chest. Energy flashes 
                        forth knocking him to the ground. The darkelf felt ice 
                        form in his veins, the cold sending a shock through his 
                        frail frame and a burning pain in his chest. He could 
                        fill a cold grip around his heart as it began slow, his 
                        body growing colder and colder. The pain was unbearable 
                        but then death bid a welcome release to the darkelf.</font></p>

                        life ends for the three, so does the waking dream begin. 
                        Through death the three were removed from the primary 
                        plane of existence and taken to the realms beyond. There 
                        they each received a vision, different for all yet the 
                        message remained the same. Innoruuk the Father of Hate, 
                        Rallos Zek the Warloard, and Cazic Thule the Faceless 
                        One struck an unholy alliance. A war was coming, one in 
                        which the gods themselves would be involved. A great war 
                        in which no one would be spared, triumph or death the 
                        only possible outcomes. The dark three are not prepared 
                        to lose this war and so, even as the light dwellers squabble 
                        among themselves, they chose their generals to make ready 
                        the troops. Great turmoil is to come upon the realtive 
                        peace that had selted on Norrath and even the so called 
                        gods of light will be fighting amongst themselves. The 
                        three will use this opportunity to take hold of Norrath 
                        and any who would dare stand in their way shall be destroyed. 
                        The gods then returned Troll, Ogre, and Dark elf to their 
                        former lands although not their former existance. Each 
                        was given new life and new purpose. They must prepare 
                        the way for the great shadow to cover the light and spread 
                        its harmful rays to all who do not bend their knees in 
                        subjugation. </font></p>
