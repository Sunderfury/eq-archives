============================
<br><br>
I am a *good* Magician. I consider Necromancers, Shadow Knights, Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres and Iksar as my main adversaries.
So, I come to Guk. I need a group. I shout. I get a reply. There’s a Necro, Cleric and a Fighter who want me.
<br><br>
Abashi, what should I do?
<br><br>
<b>There are certainly people who feel the same as you do in regards to roleplay. My best suggestion would be to seek them out and group with them. You're not the only one.
<br><br>
You could also consider starting over on one of the Team servers, where people tend to follow your ideals. I've always found the team servers very conducive to roleplay, even when grouping with people who haven't done it before.
<br><br>

============================
<br><br>
<b>*Time for a minor rant >: )*</b>
<br><br>
That's a great response from Gordon, but unfortunately he forgot to mention that the Team PvP Servers ''USE TO'' be really good for following the RPing ideals that you have, but since the loot change the role-playing has fallen off dramatically. Since the loot change x-teaming (and especially twinking, but that's another rant) have reached an all time high from what I have observed, and there is no sign of any slowing of the growing number of x-teamers out there. The boundaries between lightie and darkie held areas has been badly blurred, with no hope of recovery. The most unfortunate part is that, even though there are many on both the lightie teams and the darkie team that don't like the results of the change, it seems that the darkies got the shortest end of the stick on this one. In this Troll's opinion, the loot change was a gigantic step in the direction of a blue server. So even though your a ''Good'' magician, don't get your hopes up to high for the Team PvP servers. They're better than blue servers, but not by much.
<br><br>
Kudos to all of you who still play it straight!</font></p>

  </font></i></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">10-07-2000 | 2:17pm 
  | All Servers</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here's some good news for those of you that are always looking to get a little better performance from your PC. EQ will be moving to DX7.0a soon to help with video lag and general video performance. Here's the post from Gordon..<br>
=====================================
<br><br>
Hello all,
As many of you know, over the past couple of months we’ve made numerous enhancements to the EverQuest client. In addition to things such as new /-commands and other changes of that nature, we’ve enhanced the UI itself to allow moveable and resizable windows, among other things. At the same time we’ve been working on a brand new sound engine, and have been further concentrating on optimizing and expanding the capabilities of the EverQuest client.
<br><br>
For most applications, the feature set of a version of DirectX is limited to the lowest common denominator between the version that the software is compiled under, and the version running on the client. This means that though you may be running DirectX 7.0a already, and are receiving advantages associated with the more advanced code, the feature-set of DirectX used when in EverQuest is limited to version 5.2.
<br><br>
This limits the type and breadth of enhancements that can be made to the client. Given that we feel that EverQuest players would enjoy continuing to see new enhancements for the client, we will soon begin compiling the client under DirectX 7.0a, and implementing the feature-set available within that version. When we do this, everyone will need DirectX 7.0a (or higher) to play EverQuest. 
<br><br>
Here are some of the possible benefits from DirectX 7.0a:
<br><br>
- Better performance (Graphics and Sound)<br>
- Gamma Correction working in D3D<br>
- Proper Mip-Mapping in D3D<br>
- Fixes fogging on some cards. (Some cards have no fogging at all and look pretty bad)<br>
- Allows us to use newer interfaces to support such features as full-screen anti-aliasing, and alternate Z-buffering methods, which tend to look better.
<br><br>
Changing to DX7 does have a potential downside. Those using older or discontinued video or sound cards that do not have DX7 compatible drivers may need to upgrade to continue playing. However, we feel that the benefits that will come from upgrading to this newer version of DirectX outweigh the potential problems.
<br><br>
We plan to begin requiring DirectX7.0a when the EverQuest client is next patched, in two or three weeks. We wanted to be sure to give everyone enough time to check their version of DirectX and install the newest version. You can run DXDIAG.EXE in your Windows\System directory to check your DirectX version and get the newest version of DirectX from <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/directx target=_blank>Microsoft</a> if it is needed.
<br><br>
Please keep an eye on the patch message for further information regarding the planned implementation of DX7.
<br><br>
-Gordon

Well, currently im working on a new blacksmithing

  | Site News</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I’ve been looking for news that directly effects the dark races, and lets face it.. there isn’t really much to find. I put this site together specifically to support the dark races (especially in PvP) because honesty, this game is tipped for those snobby light races. I am hoping that all the dark race players that have continued to visit this site will help out with info on events, & news for the dark community. In this I am saying that I am willing to support any dark guilds or groups that want to get involved with events or quests on their servers by posting times, dates, or information for them here on the main page for all to see. 
<br><br>
I also plan to focus on the dark races a little better on this site. A <a href=http://www.oggok.com/warpvpclass.htm>''Warrior PvP Guide''</a> has been posted, with tips and tricks for facing those caster/hybrid classes. Also a <a href=http://www.oggok.com/spells/shaman/shaman_spell_type.htm>''Shaman Spell List''</a> has been posted with a bit of a twist. It lists spells by type instead of by level (the standard level list will be coming soon). Now if your looking specifically for a buff, or a DD spell.. they are all listed together with additional info on the spell. To add to this the Shadow Knight spell list will be coming soon. From this point on I will try to focus on the dark races before I focus on other classes/races that do not directly effect playing a dark race character. I hope that everyone will pitch in with news and events so that this site becomes a better place for darkies to visit.
