                    of Oggok and the Ogres themselves is a tale of war, triumph, 
                    treachery, and eventual defeat. During the second age the 
                    Ogres were a vast empire, unstoppable in might, with over 
                    eight separate strongholds, now only Oggok remains. Very few 
                    ogres remember their former glory, but those that do seek 
                    to restore it. Below is a breif passage from an Elven book 
                    of history. It breifly describes the events that lead up to 
                    the current state of the ogres and their society. Below that 
                    is a player submitted history section.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It was 
                    during the second age of Norrath, when the gods still seeded 
                    the lands with life, that Rallos Zek, the warlord, did create 
                    the Orcs on Faydwer, and the giants and ogres on Tunaria (now 
                    called Antonica) The giants, being one people at that time, 
                    flourished in the Northlands, vast and fertile grasslands 
                    that stretched from the ocean to the great mountains both 
                    to the east and south. In seclusion they made huge cities 
                    and castles, and built a civilization rivaled at the time 
                    by very few of the other intelligent races. They were a strong 
                    nation, and worshipped their creator, the Warlord. Armies 
                    and outposts guarded the passes leading into the Northlands, 
                    and the few times their home was attacked, the invaders were 
                    utterly crushed.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Far to 
                    the south, another civilization grew to great power as well. 
                    The Ogres also worshipped the Warlord, even more fervently 
                    than the Giants. Their empire constantly expanded, eventually 
                    even to other dimensions, and upon invading the Plane of Earth 
                    they did do battle with the Council of Rathe. Initially the 
                    Ogres had victory over thes twelve mighty beings, but as one 
                    of these gods fell, soon another rose from the earth to take 
                    his place. The Ogres could do little against an eternal foe, 
                    and were eventually defeated, their armies forced to fall 
                    back through the portals that had brought them to that plane. 
                    Hoards of earth elementals and flesh eating plants followed 
                    them, even into Norrath, and southern Tunaria fell victum 
                    to the wrath of the Twelve Gods.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rallos 
                    Zek looked upon the Ogres, and in seeing their defeat, grew 
                    angry. And while he was a lesser deity, he was still the god 
                    of war, and in his arrogance he too opened a portal to the 
                    Plane of Earth and led his forces to invade it. An inconceivable 
                    battle ensued, one of which history says little other than 
                    the heavens themselves shook, and in the end even the Warlord 
                    was defeated by the Council of Rathe. He and his minions were 
                    cast back into the Planes of Influence, and the greater gods 
                    came together, creating a barrier such that no lesser god 
                    or creature could ever pass into the Planes of Power again. 
                    They also saw if fit to punish Rallos Zek for his treachery 
                    and arrogance.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ogres, 
                    being already dispersed and defeated, were cursed. Thousand 
                    died instantly, all but the most basic of knowledges was removed 
                    from their midst and their empire was scattered. The surviving 
                    Ogres then began to dwell in small villages, warring on themselves 
                    over petty things, their former glory gone forever. The Orcs 
                    and Giants, also the Warlord's creation, were to feel their 
                    wrath as well. The fate of the Orcs is almost totally unknown, 
                    for they are not a people to keep history, concerned only 
                    for the present. But the Giants remember...</font></p>
