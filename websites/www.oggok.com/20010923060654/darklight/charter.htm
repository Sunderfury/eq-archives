        Must have a Beginning...</font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
        story of the three and the founding of the war began with the coming of 
        nightfall, and with it a great darkness. Black clouds filled the skys 
        over Antonica, cutting off what little light the moon and stars could 
        afford. But the darkness was more than just the shadows of clouds for 
        the flickering of torches could not penetrate far into the night's embrace 
        and even magic seemed less effect against it. A great wind began to howl, 
        accompanied by thunder and lighting, yet the storm brought with it no 
        rain for it was not the work of Karana. Some began to stir in Norrath 
        that night, a feeling that all could sense. Good, evil, and even the indifferent.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
        first was called from the swamps in the lower regions of Norrath. A troll 
        hunter of renowned prowess and battle skill. The dark wind found him unable 
        to sleep, something in the back of his mind pulling at his consciousness 
        calling him deep into the swamp. Something was waiting for him, what it 
        was he did know. Abandoning his home he set out for this unknown. Far 
        into the darkened swamp he did travel, so far that the terrain became 
        unfamiliar to him yet the call pulled him deeper and deeper. Abruptly 
        the troll stoped, standing at the edge of a murky pool. The wind danced 
        on the surface of the water causing it to churn violently and something 
        else as well. Slowly a figure rose from its depths. The troll dropped 
        to his knees, knowing the embodiment of his deity and creator, the Faceless 
        One, stood before him. The dark avatar reached out a hand, beckoning the 
        troll to approach. The warrior had served his lord all his life and did 
        not hesitate to once again follow his bidding. Something changed though, 
        the water around the troll's legs began to thicken as he walked, soon 
        he was unable to move his feet. The more he struggled, the tighter the 
        liquid's grasp became. Then it began to make its way up the troll's body, 
        its thick black tentacles wrapping around his arms and chest. As the fluid 
        constricted around his throat the troll looked up to see the emotionless 
        face of Cazic Thule and he attempted to cry out, but there was no air 
        left in his lungs to scream. Then life gave way to death.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
        dark wind howled as it moved ever farther, spreading north across all 
        of Norrath. A jungle, this one's inhabitants larger even than the trolls. 
        It was here the second was called, a lone ogre, his hands stained with 
        the blood of many light-dwellers. He was a student of history, one of 
        very few who kept the old ways. A warrior who knew of his past and where 
        his people came from. As he felt the wind's touch, something in his soul 
        told him destiny was nigh. Looking out into the jungle, he began to run. 
        To run down many pathes he had never seen before, being drawn away from 
        the safety of his home. As he ran, the Ogre began to feel more like the 
        prey than the hunter. As he neared the extent of his stamina and will 
        power something stirred in the darkness. At first the Ogre saw nothing 
        more few large trees. Slowly the realization came over him that the object 
        was not a group of trees, but the silhouetted legs of a larger being, 
        taller than the ogre, taller even than the giants. The Ogre felt immense 
        power and, for the first time in his life, great fear. Before him stood 
        the Great Warlord, Rallos Zek. The Ogre was so struct with awe at seeing 
        the father of his race that his muslces froze in place. The figure stretched 
        one mighty hand and, with a single crushing blow, the ogre was knocked 
        to the ground in death.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
        wind blew on, meeting its final distention far to the north in a forest 
        already thought haunted by many. In the shadows of a tall tree knelt a 
        dark elf. He was a priest of unquestionable faith and loyalty. In silence 
        he meditated, listening to the dark night, knowing that things beyond 
        the normal were taking place. Dread filled his heart as he reflected on 
        the omens he had bore witness to in his dreams the past four nights. He 
        was pulled from his trance by a flash of light, a small floating bauble 
        that glowed blue in color. After a moment, almost as if waiting just long 
        enough to catch the dark elf's curiosity, it began to move away. Quickly 
        and quietly he jumped to hs feet and gave chase. At first he was careful 
        to not make any sounds as he moved, but the floating light moved faster 
        and faster from before him. It did not take long before he was forced 
        to give up all stealth and secrecy to run so that it would not move out 
        of sight. Hours passed, yet the dark elf was so enthralled by the sphere 
        that he did not stop in his pursuit. Eventually the globe stopped moving 
        forward and began to ascend high into the air. The darkelf fell back and 
        covered his eyes when the glowing ball flashes bright as day. Quickly 
        it faded back to a glow again, revealing itself to be a staff in the hand 
        of the Prince of Hatred. The preist stood motionless, unsure if he should 
        kneel or run away as fast as his feet could move. The decision was made 
        for him as the entity pointed one finger at the darkelf's chest. Energy 
        flashes forth knocking him to the ground. The darkelf felt ice form in 
        his veins, the cold sending a shock through his frail frame and a burning 
        pain in his chest. He could fill a cold grip around his heart as it began 
        slow, his body growing colder and colder. The pain was unbearable but 
        then death bid a welcome release to the darkelf.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">As 
        life ends for the three, so does the waking dream begin. Through death 
        the three were removed from the primary plane of existence and taken to 
        the realms beyond. There they each received a vision, different for all 
        yet the message remained the same. Innoruuk the Father of Hate, Rallos 
        Zek the Warloard, and Cazic Thule the Faceless One struck an unholy alliance. 
        A war was coming, one in which the gods themselves would be involved. 
        A great war in which no one would be spared, triumph or death the only 
        possible outcomes. The dark three are not prepared to lose this war and 
        so, even as the light dwellers squabble among themselves, they chose their 
        generals to make ready the troops. Great turmoil is to come upon the realtive 
        peace that had selted on Norrath and even the so called gods of light 
        will be fighting amongst themselves. The three will use this opportunity 
        to take hold of Norrath and any who would dare stand in their way shall 
        be destroyed. The gods then returned Troll, Ogre, and Dark elf to their 
        former lands although not their former existance. Each was given new life 
        and new purpose. They must prepare the way for the great shadow to cover 
        the light and spread its harmful rays to all who do not bend their knees 
        in subjugation. </font></p>
