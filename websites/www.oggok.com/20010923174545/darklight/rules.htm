      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Try 
        to remain incharacter (IC) at all times, though situations may warrant 
        otherwise. Get involved with the guild, create a unique character history 
        and perspective for your chacacter and his ideology. Avoid zone flaming 
        and chat not related to game events. If you have something that needs 
        to be said not in a game manner then preface your comment with OOC (Out 
        Of Character) Remember, /shout for incharacter zone messages and /ooc 
        for out of character zone messages.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Proper 
        Language...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Swearing, 
        RL racial slurs and off color jokes will not be tolerated. We want this 
        guild to be fun but still functions as maturely as possible. Insulting 
        persons for RolePlaying uses is acceptable but do not direct any of them 
        at the player, only his character. Things such as 'Whats your LOC?' should 
        be said in OOC.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Use 
        of /anonymous...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
        command /annoymous should only be used in cases of extreme harrassment, 
        undercover work, and enchanter illusion spells. This command will remove 
        your guild tag. Using /roleplay should be used for things like moving 
        the guild from zone to zone and for battles. Generally leave /roleplay 
        turned off the remainder of the time because it prevents the /who all 
        Guild from functioning. Hopefully Verant will fix this problem in the 
        future. If this happens the entire guild shall move to /roleplay.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Twinking 
        and Exploits...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
        guild will not engage in such activities as hand offs, game AI manipulation 
        for level advancement, and mule characters. Verant does not tollerate 
        the use of exploits, cheats, and 3rd party programs and so this guild 
        will not either. In extreme cases such as character corruption, some actions 
        may be deem reasonable but all three members of the Triad must agree.

        all Members with Respect...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Your 
        character and another guild member's character may have opposing views 
        but all out hatred and anamosity amongst guildmembers will not be allowed 
        to continue. All the members of this guild are brothers in arms. Treat 
        each other with respect and friendship. An army divided shall fall. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Follow 
        the Chain of Command...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
        officers are not unjust in their dealings and will not show favoritism 
        les they lose all rank and privileges. However, you will be required to 
        follow their instructions. In the guild, the Triad is the top line of 
        command, followed by the commanders and then the leutinents. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Use 
        of Tradeskills...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Tradeskills 
        take money to learn and master, especially if you have several failures 
        in a row. For fellow guild members you can charge a fair price for your 
        services. No one is expected to pay cost for products, but neither should 
        they have to be what one not in the guild would be charged. If you want 
        to sell your services at cost for guildmembers that is your right. Members 
        should never expect this kind of action or assume that becuase they bought 
        the components that a labor charge will not be applied. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Use 
        of /guildsay...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
        guild channel is a way for all members to stay in constant contact no 
        matte what zone they are in. Avoid usint the guildchannel as your personal 
        chat room. Spying Information about our enemies and their strengths and 
        weaknesses shall be collected only by ingame means. No members shall be 
        allowed to create 'spy' characters of opposite races. If it is found out 
        that you are either running a spy or are a spy for one of the other teams 
        you will be immediately removed from the guild and put on our Hated Enemy 
        list. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Killing 
        Other Players...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We 
        are evil, feel free to back stab, root and overly bash those of opposite 
        teams and do not show them any honor in battle. Run from battles you can 
        not win, but do not leave your brother behind to die. This is one of the 
        worst offenses you can comit against the guild. </font></p>

        Not Camp Newbie Respawn Points...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">You 
        can acquire a number of kills by attacking people as the respawn points 
        in newbie zone. This activity should be viewed as cowardice. The slaying 
        of the helpless and defenseless does very little to spread the darkness. 
        We must destroy the strongest of the lights forces, not their underlings. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Dealings 
        with the Dark Races...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If 
        another character is not part of our guild, but is part of our team then 
        treat him with the honor do is race. We do not want to promote discention 
        among our peoples. That goes against our guild charter. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Dealings 
        with Non-Dark Races...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">DO 
        NOT group with members not of the Dark Race Team. DO NOT assist them unless 
        you have a good roleplaying reason. Slavery may be a case where grouping 
        and dealing with them would be considered appropriate. Of course, if you 
        wish to sell them a fine tattered cap for 4p then be all means gouge the 
        prices. DO NOT sell any really good items to those not of the Dark Team 
        that may later be used against us. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Guild 
        Wars...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We 
        shall make several enemies as we spread the darkness on Norrath. Remember 
        that your character hates the other guild's characters, not their players. 
        The /guildwar command will not be necessary but only the Triad shall retain 
        the power to declare official guild wars. Guild Officers may need to meet 
        with opposing guild officers from time to time to discuss mutual items 
        such as where to hold battles and things of this nature. This will all 
        be done in OOC.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Languages

      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Dark 
        Speach, Troll, Ogre and Teir'Dal must never be shared with those not of 
        the Dark Team. This is considered a major offense against the guild and 
        against your entire team and race. However, take all opportunities those 
        weak minded fools offer to learn their languages. DO NOT exchange one 
        of our languages for one of theirs.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>PvP 
        Rules...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">You 
        will never ever pull the plug while Zoning. If caught doing this. It will 
        lead to a warning next action will be dismissal from the guild. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">You 
        will always show honor to your victim. By not attacking while looting 
        or running out of the zone while being escorted. You will leave the Zone 
        after getting your body if you have been killed by a PKer. You wil then 
        have to wait atleast 10 mins to return to that zone to fight with that 
        Pker. Its this that allows them to feel voctory in battle. Its a form 
        of respect. And yes not all PKers deserver respect but we will still show 
        that we are honorable. <br>
        In battle with another player you will not bag unless you see the other 
        player is naked. This is the only way Bagging is ok. If you are caught 
        being naked you will be warned. To expand on the equipment rule. If you 
        have something they can loot exp. Banded, magic jewelry, or anytype of 
        armor. This is acceptable. We do not premote naked gankers. If any question 
        please ask a Traid Leader or the Guild Leader to clear it up for you.</font></p>

        case will be different. Hopefully there will never be a need of punishment. 
        Most minor offense shall be dealt with in a RolePlaying fashion that may 
        include such things as being stripped of all awards and rank or being 
        outcast from guild activities for one week. </font></p>

        gets one warning. After that your character shall be removed from the 
        guild. None of the guildleaders want to waiste their gametime babysitting. 
        Several repeats of a minor offense shall be considered a major offense.</font></p>
