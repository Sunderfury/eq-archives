          history of Oggok and the Ogres themselves is a tale of war, triumph, 
          treachery, and eventual defeat. During the second age the Ogres were 
          a vast empire, unstoppable in might, with over eight separate strongholds, 
          now only Oggok remains. Very few ogres remember their former glory, 
          but those that do seek to restore it. Below is a breif passage from 
          an Elven book of history. It breifly describes the events that lead 
          up to the current state of the ogres and their society. Below that is 
          a player submitted history section.</font></div>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              It was during the second age of Norrath, when the gods still seeded 
              the lands with life, that Rallos Zek, the warlord, did create the 
              Orcs on Faydwer, and the giants and ogres on Tunaria (now called 
              Antonica) The giants, being one people at that time, flourished 
              in the Northlands, vast and fertile grasslands that stretched from 
              the ocean to the great mountains both to the east and south. In 
              seclusion they made huge cities and castles, and built a civilization 
              rivaled at the time by very few of the other intelligent races. 
              They were a strong nation, and worshipped their creator, the Warlord. 
              Armies and outposts guarded the passes leading into the Northlands, 
              and the few times their home was attacked, the invaders were utterly 
              crushed.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Far 
              to the south, another civilization grew to great power as well. 
              The Ogres also worshipped the Warlord, even more fervently than 
              the Giants. Their empire constantly expanded, eventually even to 
              other dimensions, and upon invading the Plane of Earth they did 
              do battle with the Council of Rathe. Initially the Ogres had victory 
              over thes twelve mighty beings, but as one of these gods fell, soon 
              another rose from the earth to take his place. The Ogres could do 
              little against an eternal foe, and were eventually defeated, their 
              armies forced to fall back through the portals that had brought 
              them to that plane. Hoards of earth elementals and flesh eating 
              plants followed them, even into Norrath, and southern Tunaria fell 
              victum to the wrath of the Twelve Gods.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rallos 
              Zek looked upon the Ogres, and in seeing their defeat, grew angry. 
              And while he was a lesser deity, he was still the god of war, and 
              in his arrogance he too opened a portal to the Plane of Earth and 
              led his forces to invade it. An inconceivable battle ensued, one 
              of which history says little other than the heavens themselves shook, 
              and in the end even the Warlord was defeated by the Council of Rathe. 
              He and his minions were cast back into the Planes of Influence, 
              and the greater gods came together, creating a barrier such that 
              no lesser god or creature could ever pass into the Planes of Power 
              again. They also saw if fit to punish Rallos Zek for his treachery 
              and arrogance.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              Ogres, being already dispersed and defeated, were cursed. Thousand 
              died instantly, all but the most basic of knowledges was removed 
              from their midst and their empire was scattered. The surviving Ogres 
              then began to dwell in small villages, warring on themselves over 
              petty things, their former glory gone forever. The Orcs and Giants, 
              also the Warlord's creation, were to feel their wrath as well. The 
              fate of the Orcs is almost totally unknown, for they are not a people 
              to keep history, concerned only for the present. But the Giants 
              remember...</font></p>
