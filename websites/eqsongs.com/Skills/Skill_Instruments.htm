using that skill, even if you are singing the song.</p>

<p>Quantified:&nbsp;( lvl + 1) * 5</p>
<p>Analysis by Rokenn Swiftsong, Ayonae Ro server.</p>
<p>Comments:&nbsp;These skills are important to keep maxed, as your skill in the
instrument for a song (ie Brass skill for Denon's Disruptive Discord) will
effect your ability to avoid missed notes even if you are singing the
song.&nbsp; Check the <a href="../Instruments.htm">Instrument page</a> for the
list of known instruments, their skill, and any special effects.</p>

    yourself logged in for several hours playing that instrument.&nbsp; With the
    Brass skill this can be dangerous as the only songs that use that skill are
    AE damage songs till much higher level.&nbsp; The solution to this is to
    visit the Arena zone off of Lake Rathe.&nbsp; This is a large open zone with
    no NPC's so you can safely play Denon's Discord for 8 hours without worrying
    about NPC's coming by to criticize your playing.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

    <font size="2">Brass skill can also be raised easily without interruption in
    the</font> <font size="2">following areas:<br>
    <br>
    East Commons/North Ro tunnel close to the zone border on either side&nbsp;<br>
    East Karana up top of the ramp (south hill works best)&nbsp;<br>
    East Karana at the dead end valley that the ramp makes&nbsp;<br>
    Any boat or shuttle as long as you do not step off with NPCs near and the
    song up<br>
    <br>
    You can also get about knee deep in the water near the zone edge and be safe
    in these zones: The Karanas (any of them just not near NPCs like the
    barbarians or mobs like Broon/Droon) Northern Ro, ButcherBlock Mountains,
    and South Qeynos.<br>
    <br>
    While the arena zone (outside of the PvP section) IS the best place to
    practice there are other places that work well. Be warned that these places,
    while still safe from wandering NPCs, CAN be trained to either intentionally
    or unintentionally by players resulting in your death if you are AFK. While
    there is a risk that someone may drag orcs past the players at the bazaar
    and to the north ro zone or all the way up the</font> <font size="2">ramp to
    highpass this risk may outweigh the risk of getting to the arena for
    you.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Also the boat is a recommended method to get those few extra points,&nbsp;</font>
    <font size="2">especially if you need to take it to get to a bard trainer or
    to obtain a new song. Make sure you stay away from NPCs on docks since being
    too close you are considered on the dock AND on the boat but if you stay
    back far enough you are considered on the boat and your songs do not affect
    anything on the docks even if they are within song range.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    This also brings up a point that a lot of people do not know, being in the
    water or out of the water or on a boat (not the small maneuverable canoes
    but the named boats that move automatically) is like being in a different
    world in certain situations. A good example of this is that if you jump in a
    lake with piranha they will attack you if you're in the water but if you
    leave the water they stop attacking; just remember that if you attack a
    skeleton or whatever on dry land then jump in the mob will usually follow
    you in anyhow. Crocs in oasis behave this way as well, you can only attack
    each other if you are both in or out of the water but they will follow you
    if you go in or out of the water, this is why you can't blast one that is in
    the water if your on land but if you go knee deep you can.</font><!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
