<p>From the Manual:<br>
Melee Disciplines<br>
<br>
In addition to the many automatic skills and abilities that characters will
receive past 50th level, we've added player-controlled fighting
&quot;disciplines&quot; to the repertoires of the pure melee (warriors, monks,
and rogues) and hybrid (Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, and Bard) classes. These
disciplines are activated using the /discipline command on the command line, and
have a duration and base reuse time associated with them. You cannot use any
other discipline until the reuse time of the last-used discipline has expired.
You can type /discipline on the command line to view the disciplines available
to you, as well as the amount of time before you can use another one.<br>
<br>
Some disciplines, particularly the ones with long duration, have a disadvantage
in addition to the advantage provided by the discipline. In all cases where this
happens, the disadvantage is less severe than the advantage. For instance, where
the Evasive Discipline allows a warrior to be hit by his opponent less by a
factor of 35%, the warrior will also hit his target less, but only by a factor
of 15%. In the interest of exploration, further formulae will not be provided. <br>
<br>
Re-use times on disciplines is base time - 1 min per level after the level the
discipline is gained.</p>
<p>General Hybrid Disciplines (All Hybrid Classes)<br>
<br>
RESISTANT (Level 51): +10 to all resistances. This discipline lasts for 1
minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour. The reuse time for this discipline
will decrease as you level.<br>
<br>
FEARLESS (Level 54 ): Immunity to &quot;Fear&quot; and all spells that cause
&quot;fear&quot;. This discipline lasts for 11 seconds, and has a base reuse
time of 1 hour. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bard Disciplines<br>
<br>
DEFTDANCE (Level 55): Auto dodge and auto dual-wield. This discipline lasts for
10 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes. <br>
<br>
PURETONE (Level 60): Makes it as if you are wielding the best instrument of
every type, whether or not you are actually wielding an instrument. This
discipline lasts for 2 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br>
