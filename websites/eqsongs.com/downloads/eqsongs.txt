1 - Chant of Battle.
Effect:  Increases strength, dexterity, and AC
Instrument:  Percussion, doubles effect
Target:  Party
Does not stack with:  Anthem (L10), Guardian Rhythms (L17)
Taunt: Low
Quantified:

Comments: This is your first song, and as such you'll be using it all
the time the first few levels.  It is not very impressive, and you'll
probably put it away once you get Anthem at level 10.

Strategies:

- Play it when you're fighting.  :-)

- Good for running when you're encumbered since you'll be using
  Accelerando with it, which also uses a drum.  Toss in Warsong as
  well if you can maintain 3 songs.

- If anyone in your party has a weapon that procs, the dex boost from
  this song will make it proc more often, potentially making this song
  preferable to Anthem.

- Rumored to increase your chance of success at blacksmithing and
  various other trade skills due to the stat boosts.  Well, it can't
  hurt.

- If you have an enchanter in your group casting attack speedups, that
  relegates Anthem to just a strength boost.  In that case, you may
  want to use Chant instead.

Cautions:

- Don't use it with a drum at early levels - bards can still stand toe
  to toe with other melee classes then, and the stat bosst is pretty
  minor.  At higher levels (level 20+) the stat boost becomes pretty
  substantial and our melee ability begins to pale compared to the
  true tanks, so this becomes a viable strategy though.

2 - Chords of Disonnance.
Effect:  Damage over time
Instrument:  Strings, doubles the effect
Target:  Area effect
Does not stack with:  N/A
Taunt: Moderate

Quantified:

Comments: As your second song, you'll probably experiment with this a
bit.  It's a nice boost to your attacks if used wisely.  Since it's
also our first area effect, be careful that you don't attract more
than you really want to fight.  You'll likely learn many painful
lessons about when not to use area effect songs, which is ok.  Dying
at level 2 is much better than dying at level 12.

It is damage over time - you will only get one "winces" message when
the song pulses, but you can stop this song to play two others and the
target(s) will still continue to take damage.

Strategies:
- Be very cautious using it in zones with merchants or guards
  (especially the wandering kind), as they will not appreciate you
  trying to damage them and will quickly beat you to a bloody pulp.

- Since this song uses strings, weaving it with Hymn with a lute
  equipped is a viable strategy, though it probably won't work well
  solo except against green mobs.  Later when you get Discord, you can
  weave all three while switching instruments to do damage comparable
  to or exceeding what your weapons are capable of.

- Can be used to kite multiple mobs if you're very careful.

Cautions:

- Don't forget to turn it off when visiting town, esepcially Kelethin
  (where you don't have a zone to automatically turn your songs off).

- Don't hit it by accident while in town.

3 - Jig of Vigor
Effect:  Replenishes stamina
Instrument: percussion, N/T
Target: Party
Does not stack with:  N/A
Taunt: Nil-Low

Quantified: ??

Comments: Generally not very useful.  When you are below 33% stamina,
your str, dex, and agi start to drop (though it seems to be capped at
-10 each), so it's a good idea not to let this happen in a fight.
This song also means bards are relatively immune to the effects of
starvation (health and stamina do not regenerate) should you ever find
yourself in that position.  Not having used this song much, I can't
say whether it has a taunt effect.

Strategies:
- Good to have memorized if your party is fighting underwater, as
  stamina does not seem to regenerate while swimming.  Augmentation
  (if you ahve an enchatner or shaman) is probably better for this
  though.

Cautions:

- Clerics, enchanters, and paladins get spells which do the same
  thing, so you may be better off using the song slot for something
  else and relying on them to invigorate you should you run low on
  stamina.  If everyone in your group is chronically running low on
  stamina every fight, then the song is probably better since it uses
  no mana.

4 - Lyssa's Locating Lyric
Effect:  Points you in the direction of someone's corpse
Instrument: Singing
Target: Target
Does not stack with: N/A
Taunt: Nil

Quantified: N/A

Comments: Points you in the direction of someone's corpse every pulse.
If you target a player before playing the song, it will point you to
his/her corpse.  The player needs to be in the zone for this to
properly work though, unless you already have their corpse targeted.
If no target is selected when playing this song, it points you to the
nearest corpse.

Strategies:

- It helps if you're grouped with the person whose corpse you're
  tracking.  If something attacks you while you're searching, it
  automatically becomes your new target.  If the person whose corpse
  you're finding is not around anymore, you will have to find him
  again to target him for the song.  If you're grouped, you can just
  click on his name to target him.

- Sometimes someone in your group will end up with a corpse stuck in
  an inaccessible location (e.g. inside a wall), but are unable to
  come and /corpse it for themselves (e.g. you're deep in a dungeon
  and they can't make themselves invisible).  If they trust you, they
  can /consent to you, and you can use this song to target the corpse.
  Once it's targeted, you can use the '/corpse [playername]' command
  to drag their corpse out of the wall and back to them (while singing
  your invisibility song of course).

Cautions:

- There is a corpse bug where two people will not see the corpse in
  the same place.  This seems to be cleared up by leaving and
  re-entering the zone (or camping) twice.

Comments: This song probably most defines the bard.  We get it before
any other classes get SoW (shamen get that at level 9), and with a
drum it quickly surpasses anything the "Spirit of the..." spells are
capable of.  Aside from teleportation, no other class can beat a bard
with a drum.

Strategies:

- This song effectively means you can run away from any outdoor fight
  which turns sour.

- Playing the song with a drum speeds you up considerably.  This can
  be especially useful if you or a party member is wounded to the
  point where they can only walk.  Play Accelerando with your drum
  equipped, and the speedup is often faster than normal running speed.

- When traveling as a group with this song, it seems to work best if
  you pick a leader, everyone follows the leader, and you follow them.
  That way you can spot anyone who falls behind and wait for them to
  catch up with the rest of the group.

Cautions:

- Does not work in underground zones.

- Does not break root anymore, although if you already had the song
  playing when you are rooted, leaving it playing will break root upon
  the next pulse.

- You start to run more slowly when you drop below 33% hp.  At earlier
  levels, this is enough so that you can't outrun mobs even with this
  song.  So be prepared to flee before you hit 33%.

- Starting about level 16, you will begin to take damage going down
  steep declines.  As you get faster, you will take more damage, until
  you get safe fall at level 24.  Some places are worse than others in
  terms of steep drops, so be sure you're familiar with the terrain
  before you put yourself on auto-run.

- There is a bug where if the timing of your song stop/starts is just
  right (or just wrong), an instant after your current song starts,
  its previous instance will end and wipe out the song effect.  It's a
  minor annoyance with most songs, but can spell death with
  Accelerando, since the only time you really need to restart this
  song is when you're trying to run away from certain death.

Effect: Increases faction with NPCs
Instrument: Wind, instrument boosts effect slightly
Target: Target
Does not stack with: N/A
Taunt: N/A

Quantified: On average it seems to raise you one or two faction
rankings.  The size of each faction rank seems to be different so the
song may raise you anywhere from 0 to 2 ranks.  Using a wind
instrument seems to enhance the effect slightly.  People have claimed
that in some cases using a flute raised their faction one more rank
than just singing the song.

Comments: This is a really nifty song at the lower levels when money
is scarce.  At higher levels, I find myself using it only for quests
and occasionally when buying/selling big ticket items to guarantee I'm
getting the best possible price.

Strategies:

Cautions:

- This song uses the same icon as Lament and charm.  Be careful that
  you're using the Carillon and not one of these offensive songs.  The
  Carillon will give an immediate message "A wave of enchantment
  washes over you."  If you do not see this message immediately upon
  starting the song, STOP WHATEVER SONG IT IS YOU'VE STARTED.

- Of all things, counters will block this song.  The spell effects
  will go off as if it worked, but you will get a message saying "you
  cannot see your target," and your faction will not change.  Make
  sure you have clear line of sight with the target.  Small
  differences in height (if your target is standing in a slightly
  recessed area for instance) will cause it to fail as well.

12 - Brusco's Boastful Bellow
Effect: Direct Damage
Instrument: Singing
Target: Target
Does not stack with: N/A
Taunt: Moderate

Quantified:  Max damage is (level/2 - 1)

Comments: Basically a bard's version of kick.  It's a little extra
damage you can apply at the cost of giving up one of your songs.  It
is rarely resisted by anything that isn't red, but the higher the
monster /cons, the less damage the song will do on average.  Against
low reds, it's not unusual for the song to do just 1 point of damage
when not resisted.  The damage and resistance rate also seems to vary
between mobs of the same level, probably depending on the mob's magic
resist.

Strategies:

- This is really nice for chasing down mobs that run at the end of a
  fight.  Ideally these should be rooted or snared, but sometimes it
  just doesn't work out that way.  Due to Internet latency, it can be
  difficult for you to stay in melee range; and in twisty dungeons a
  caster might not be able to stop to cast while keeping line of sight
  with the mob.  But you can chase mobs through twists and turns while
  hitting them with this song, as long as you have clear line of sight
  when the song fires (doesn't matter when it's started).

- Also good for pulling, though the range is a bit short.  Have
  Accelerando running, hit your pull with this song, turn and run and
  start up Accelerando again at the same time.  You should be able to
  do this fast enough that you don't slow down at all.

- An alternate way of pulling is to wait for Accelerando to expire,
  then hit your pull with this song and immediately start running.  As
  long as you began in a straight line between the mob and your party,
  the mob will not get within melee range during the trip back.  It
  will however stay in Bellow range (which would not be the case if
  you'd used Accelerando).  So you can Bellow it continuously as you
  bring it back to your party.  Beware that the damage from this will
  make the mob more angry at you, and it'll be harder for your party
  to pull it off you.

- You can use this song to kite, using the same strategy as listed
  above (mixing in Accelerando from time to time to keep out of melee
  range of the mob).

Cautions:

- Don't grow dependent on this song.  A lot of non-bards complain
  about grouping with a bard who does nothing but bellow.  This song
  has the same effect whether you're solo or in a full group.  Most of
  our other songs have an increased effect in a group (since it
  affects more people).  Buffing your tanks and increasing everyone's
  magic resist can easily outweigh the benefit of the extra damage you
  can do with Bellow.

- I list it as having a moderate taunt effect.  Personally I'd rate it
  as low, but a lot of people complain that this song seems to attract
  other mobs in dungeons.  My opinion is that this song is the first
  ranged attack available to most bards (having neglected throwing
  knives), and thus they're not used to a ranged attack drawing
  multiple critters that are within aggro radius of each other.  And
  so they're wrongly attributing the trains caused by their
  inexperience to a perceived taunt effect of this song.  Whatever the
  cause, it can be dangerous until you learn the hang of it so perhaps
  a moderate taunt rating is appropriate.

Effect: Random teleport

Target: Party
Does not stack with: N/A
Taunt: ??

Quantified: ??

Comments: Teleports you and your party members a random distance in a
random direction.  The distance seems to be dependent on level and 
whether
or not you're using a wind instrument.  It might've been marginally 
useful
as a group escape tool, except it teleports each group member to a
different random location.  It will not teleport you through walls or
closed doors.  It will place you at ground level.

Strategies:

- Useful for instantly coming down from high places, like the top of
  the Aviak Village, or the wizard teleport site spires.  I hear the
  range when you first get the song is not enough to teleport you the
  distance down.

- This used to be useful if you got dragged up a portcullis (Paw and
  Permafrost), but they changed it so it doesn't work through walls
  anymore.  Once you're dragged up, you have walls on both sides so
  you won't teleport anywhere.  Still, it's worth a shot, especially
  if you're not completely pulled up inside the portcullis.  Make sure
  you disband from the rest of your party so they are not flung around.

- It can function as a poor escape tool.  It could teleport you far
  enough from the mobs that you have enough time to run for the zone
  without being hit from behind.  Of course in the time it takes to
  start this song, you could start Accelerando and accomplish the same
  thing.  It might be a useful tactic in a duel though.

Cautions:

- A good way to get your party members pissed off at you, since 
everyone
  teleports to different locations.  Of course if that's your intent...

- Generally a good way to get killed quickly.  I've teleported right
  into a full spawn of level 30ish goblins in Permafrost while trying
  to get a friend unstuck.

- The song will place you at ground level, which for bodies of water
  means at the bottom.  If it's dark and/or the water is murky, you can
  easily become disoriented and drown before reaching the surface.  So
  make sure you consider this possibility if you're using it near 
water.

this spell is broken, works only against mob spells, or has some yet

Comments:  This song will revitalize your ability to solo.  At this 
level
nearly anything that isn't green to you will tear you to shreds with 
their
overpowered melee capability (thanks Verant) if you try to fight them 
with
your now-pathetic melee skills.  You know what I'm talking about - 
casting
mobs that are nearly impossible to interrupt, casting mobs that double
attack for 40+ damage, mobs that backstab with their fists, etc.  This
song lets you turn a mob's overpowered attacks against its comrades
instead of against you or your party.  Used smartly, you can avoid 
taking
any damage at all.

Your new pet seems to default to a "follow me" and "guard me" state.  
This
has both advantages and disadvantages.  Pet commands start with "/pet"
followed by the actual command.  Useful commands are "attack", "back 
off"
(to stop it from attacking a party member), "sit down" (just fun to see
some things sit), "guard here" (if you don't want it to move from a
spot), and "follow me" and "guard me" for impressing others by having 
the
feared mob call you master.  :-)

Strategies:

- Set up the /pet commands as socials buttons, then assign them to your
hotkeys.  That way you don't have to type in the full /pet command 
every
time.

- The trickiest part to using this song is in recharming the mob.  When 
a
mob becomes uncharmed, it and whatever it was fighting will all charge 
and
attack you.  So it pays to recharm the mob as quickly as possible.
Charm, order it to attack, then BACK OFF.  The song has a tremedous 
range
so you want to be far enough away to give yourself plenty of time to
recharm as your former pet and the mob it was fighting both charge you.
Given enough open space or a long enough hallway, it is possible to
completely avoid taking damage while using this song.

- You can use your songs to help time how long the charm lasts.
Immediately after re/charming your pet (and making sure it's attacking 
the
right target), start up another song.  If your charm lasts the full
duration, shortly after your other song pulses twice the charm will
expire.  You can use this to recharm the mob almost instantly with a 
bit
of practice.  You probably don't want to cut it too close though, since 
if
you're early, the mob will uncharm right after your song pulses, 
meaning
it will beat on you for a full song-start-up cycle.

- When recharmed, your pet usually defaults to carrying out its 
previous
attack order.  That means you can leave your pet targeted and 
concentrate
on other songs instead of retargeting and re-ordering it to attack.  I
usually heal (Hymn) or prepare to run (Accelerando) while the pet is 
busy
attacking.  If I'm in a group, I may sing some party buff songs.

- It wipes the damage list and the hate list (except hatred for the 
bard).
This can be used to thwart kill-stealers, but it can also used to kill
steal so I won't go into details.  As an anti-kill-stealing tool 
though,
it's most useful for getting casters to dump most or all of their mana 
on
what is now your protected pet.  The only caveat is that DoTs seem to 
give
damage credit to the caster if it lasts the duration of the charm.  If
you're facing a kill-stealing DoTer, you'll have to cancel magic to 
cancel
the DoT.

- It is great for pulling off mobs that have frenzied onto someone 
else.
Because it wipes the hate list of everyone but you, it is guaranteed to
work if it isn't resisted.  The only exception is if someone is very 
close
to dying, in which case nothing I know of (short of healing the person)
can get mobs off him.  Even orc pawns will attack a high level person 
who
is very close to dying.  Clerics and casters love bards who use this 
song
to pull mobs off them.

- It's nice for pulling in casting mobs.  Casters tend to stand their
ground and nuke you instead of walking into the deathtrap your party 
has
set up for it.  If you charm a caster and tell it to "follow me", it 
will
happily follow you right into your party's blades.  Make sure your 
party
is aware that you're charming it, otherwise they may waste mana trying 
to
nuke your pet.

- If your party works well together, you can use charm as a substitue 
for
Lullaby.  You charm one mob, all the other mobs attack your pet.  Your 
party
pulls one mob from this group and fights it off to the side.  You keep
charming to keep the other mobs occupied (usually sacrificing a few 
pets
to buy your group time).

- You can cast buffs on pets.  With our short duration charm, I'm not 
sure
why you'd want to, but it's always an option.

- You can cast cancel magic on pets.  If a mob you're fighting has 
several
buffs on it, you can charm it, then let a party member hit it with 
several
cancels without it going aggro on him.  This doesn't work so well with
casting mobs since they usually just rebuff themselves.  I suppose you
could do try using this to drain their mana (cancel tends to be a cheap
spell).

- I've heard that if you charm a mob that casts SoW while underground,
sometimes it will cast SoW on you.  :-)

- Think carefully about which mob you should charm.  For example, the
mortuary fungus in Unrest is not particularly difficult to kill, nor 
does
it do a lot of damage.  But the mort drowsy spell it casts renders all
melee mobs nearly completely ineffective.  I was able to use a fungus 
to
kill a skeletal monk and two barbed bones simultaneously, even though
monks and barbed bones are much more dangerous.

Cautions:

- The song tends to have a pretty big taunt effect.  If you're left 
with a
pet with a considerable amount of life left, it will beat on you for 
quite
a while as your party attacks it from behind.  A tank can sometimes get 
it
off you with a taunt and high-damage hit, but be prepared to really 
take a
beating until your party gets the former pet off you.

- You need to have your pet targeted to recharm it, so you can't really
help your group or your pet by fighting another mob.  (You can, but
switching targets can get tricky.)  So just keep your pet targeted, and
equip an instrument to concentrate on buffing/healing your party 
instead.

- It's important to charm and recharm only one mob at a time.  If you
charm a different one, your former pet will attack you almost 
exclusively
until it dies.  So instead of having two mobs attacking each other, 
you'll
wind up with one mob attack a mob that's attacking you.  This prevents 
you
from being able to back off to prepare to recharm.

- Your pet has to be your pet when the mob it was fighting dies in 
order
for you to get credit for it.  If your pet becomes uncharmed and your
party kills its target, the kill goes to what is now an unaffiliated 
mob,
and you get no experience and the corpse disappears.  For this reason I
would not recommend using charmed mobs to kill named mobs, unless you 
make
it clear to your group to let the pet make the kill.  Sometimes I'll 
order
a pet to attack a different target every time I recharm it.  That way 
it
softens up the horde of mobs, without doing enough damage to any 
specific
one to steal the kill.  You get Pixie Strike next level, which is 
better
for controling multi-mob (more than two) situations anyway

- Sometimes your pet will attack a party member on its own.  I'm not 
quite
sure why this happens, but since it's a pet, the party member cannot 
fight
back.  Give the pet the "/pet back off" ASAP to get it to stop 
attacking.
You'll have to retarget and give a new "/pet attack" order.

- Some mobs are smart enough to attack the master (you) instead of the
pet.  I found out that evil eyes will do this.  I've heard guards do 
this
as well, which would make it a bad tactic to charm someone in a duel 
and
ordering him to attack a guard.

- Make sure your party knows you're charming a mob, otherwise they may
waste mana trying to nuke it (most melee types are quick to figure it 
out
when they don't swing, but most caster types tend not to read the 
messages
and thus don't see the "protected" bit).

- This song does not work (well) with the enchanter's mesmerize.  You 
can
charm a mesmerized mob, but you end up with a mesmerized pet that will
stand there and not respond to commands.

- Your pet may refuse to attack something that is too high level.  Most
undead do not care about level and will attack anything you order it to
attack.

- Mobs that are fleeing continue to flee even after charmed.  This is 
most
noticable when a pet drops low enough in life that it'll flee on its 
own.
But sometimes (e.g. Mistmoore) you'll have mobs that flee to call in
reinforcements.  Charming it will not stop it.  Most undead do not flee
so they can make better pets.

- You will find that using this song, fighting 2 or 3 mobs at once solo 
is
a lot easier than fighting 1 solo.  Don't make the mistake if thinking
that because a mob was really easy to kill with a charmed pet, that 
you'll
have an easy time soloing it.

- Don't charm healing mobs.  During the brief interval between the 
charm
expiring and you recharming, they tend to heal anything else your group 
is
fighting.

- Do not use this song to pull from a camp.  When you charm a mob, it
picks up your faction, and stuff that would attack you (i.e. everything 
in
the camp) will attack it.  Furthermore, because it's probably blue to 
you,
stuff that normally wouldn't attack you because you're too high level
*will* attack your pet.

- Do not use this song to pull from a camp if you're lulled the others.
Unless you can instantly hit it with a back-off command, your pet will 
see
all these other hostile creatures around it and attack them, defeating 
the
purpose of lulling them.

- A lot of players don't understand that when two mobs fight, it's 
usually
because one is charmed, and they'll jump in to "your" fight without
asking.

- The song caps at L37.  You cannot charm mobs L38 or higher.
Fortunately, most of the "interesting" mobs (giants and such) fall 
below
this limit.
