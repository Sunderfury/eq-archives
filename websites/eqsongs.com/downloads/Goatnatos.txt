Level 1: Chant of Battle
Effects: PARTY: +DEX , +STR, +AC
Skill Used: Percussion Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  You feel your pulse quicken
Fading Message: Your battle fury fades
Location: Any
Notes: Won't co-exist with Anthem De Arms
Rating: 3
Analysis: This is a good 1st level song and highly recommended as the primary buff song until lvl 6 (healing).  Initially, this gives you +5 STR, +5 DEX, and +5 AC.  As you go up in levels, this song will gradually become more powerful, especially when you can play an instrument instead of just singing.  This is a good buff song to twist with Hymm of Restoration (lvl 6).  Unfortuantly, Chant of battle does not appear to be able to co-exist with the 10th lvl song, Anthem De Arms.  When Anthem is active, and you try to invoke Chant, it will say "the song failed to take hold".  On the discussion boards, someone has claimed +19 STR and DEX, and +5 AC at 30th lvl while playing with a drum.  In the same message, it was mentioned that this would be a boost for someone who is trying to do smithing.
 
Level 2: Chords of Dissonance
Effects: NON-PARTY: Damage to all non PC's in 30' radius
Skill Used: Stringed Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Victim Sees: Jagged notes tear through your body  
You See: winces
Location: Any
Notes: Warning: area effect song
Rating: 2
Analysis: Commonly known as the 'wince' song as it causes all affected beings to wince for a few points of damage.  Be very careful!  This song will wince all non-PCs, including guards, inn keepers, etc...  I have died quite a few times because 1: I had this song going when I was too close to a guard or 2: I used this song to kill a monster and forgot to turn it off when returning to the safety of a guard to heal/rest.    For fun, when you get past lvl 8, go walk around the Freeport newbie area with this song on and see how man lvl 1 monsters you can kill just by playing this song.  When sung at lvl 2, it only does 2 points damage. As you level, this song will grow stronger.  Someone reported doing 16 damage per pulse with an instrument at lvl 30.
 
Level 3: Jaxan's Jig o' Vigor
Effects: PARTY: Stamina Regeneration
Skill Used: Percussion Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  The jig sends energy zinging through your body
Fading Message: You are no longer invigorated
Location: All
Rating: 2
Analysis: At first, I thought this song was totally useless, but have found some limited uses.  Basically this song restores lost stamina.  Until you get your  lvl 5 song, Jaxan's Jig o'Vigor is the song to play while traveling/running for long periods of time.  However, there is another use for this song.  Selo's Accelerando does not work when swimming, but this song will.  With Jaxan's, I was able to swim continuously for about 2 hours (actually, I fell asleep at the keyboard, don't ask) and still had 100% stamina at the end. Also, for those long battles where stamina loss becomes an issue, this song will help (but not eliminate) this problem.  There is a rumor that this song will also increase mana regeneration.  This is NOT true.  It's an illusion because this song causes effected party members to have their stats refreshed from the everquest server every 6 seconds, verses the 8 or 9 seconds for a refresh if a caster is medding.  Sure, your mana bar will get refreshed more often, but it'll just move less.
 
Level 4: Lyssa's Locating Lyric
Effects: SINGLE:  Find Corpse
Skill Used: Singing
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  A tune pervades your mind and becons you
Fading Message: You lose the locating tune
Skill Used: Singing
Location: Any
Rating: 4
Analysis: This is one of the more useful songs in the game.  It allows you to find corpses anywhere in your zone.  People are getting killed in odd places all the time and don't know where to find their corpse.  With this song, you can help them.  Just click on the person whose corpse you want to find and then fire off the song.  If you want, I'm sure you can charge money for this, but I never do.  Making friends comes in handy when looking to group up. Just remember to turn the song off if you ever need to stop looking for the corpse (you come under attack/get to the corpse and no longer need it) as every few seconds, no matter what you are doing, this song will auto turn your body to face the direction of the corpse.  Necromancers (lvl 1) and Shadowknights are the only other spellcasters that get this ability. 
 
Level 5: Selo's Accelerando
Effects: PARTY: Increases Movement
Skill Used: Percussion Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  Your feet move faster
Fading Message: You slow down
Location: Any
Rating: 6
Analysis: Even more useful than Lyssa's Locating Lyric.  This song will probably be one of the most used in a Bard's arsenal.  It makes you run... run fast.  When played with a percussion instrument (a skill which you also get at 5th lvl), you run faster than someone with the popular Spirit of the Wolf spell.  When not in combat/healing, always have this song on, in case you get jumped by a train, or if a griffin decides to reach out and touch you.  Yes, I have personally outrun the griffin with this song.  Also, you will be the toast of any party that is crossing zones as you will save them so much time.  Keep in mind, that when playing this song with a percussion instrument, you are faster than just about any monster in the game.  If you get attacked, just keep running and ignore them.  If you are under 50% HP or more, you will run slower, so if you have 1% hp left, you are not going to be 'running like the wind.'  There is one problem with this song.  Sometimes it works too well.  When traveling with a party with this song.  Always bring up the rear, ie: be the last person in the party.  People always get left behind, due to lag, packet loss, or just because you are a human and they are halflings.  Run last... keep an eye on everyone.  Being last also helps out because if the person at the front of the party gets too far ahead, he will leave the range of your song, slowing down until you catch up again.  In places like HighHold Pass, it is very difficult to keep the party together because of all of the narrow twisty passages, so be careful.  Lastly, this song only works outdoors.  It will not work in places like Kaladim, or inside any indoor dungeons.  All of this aside, the most useful aspect of this song is that it allows you to run away from a monster who is smashing you just a bit too hard.  I can't tell you the number of times I would have died had it not been for this song allowing me to run away.  Even when slowed by spells or low hitpoints, I was still able to get away a lot of times.  Keep this in mind.  If you are soloing, this very ability will allow you to take greater risks in combat with less fear of dying and that is why this song gets a rating of 6 out of a possible 1 to 5.  In support of this rumor, you can 'un-stick' people who cast minor illusion on themselves to make them look like a lamppost/tree/rock/etc... so they can walk around.  Selo's no longer breaks root type spells.  If you get rooted, use Selo's Consonant Chain instead.  While chained, you'll be able to move, albeit slowly. When chains wears off, you'll be able to move at your normal movement rate, even though the root icon will still be showing. By default, it changes your movement speed to 15.
 
Level 6: Hymn of Restoration
Effects: PARTY: Healing
Skill Used: Stringed Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  Your wounds begin to heal
Fading Message: <none>
Location: Any
Rating: 5
Analysis:  Second only to the 5th level Accelerando song, this song will make you the life of any party that has tank characters.  I have received many thanks for this song from clerics, who don't have to cast healing as often.  In combat, keep in mind that every point that is healed by this song, will piss off a monster as much as doing 1 point of damage to it.  For example, if you are healing 6 players, for 6 points each, the monsters you are fighting will react as if you were doing an extra 6*6=36 points damage to each of them every pulse.  Use with caution, monsters may start to concentrate more of their attacks on you.  As you go up in levels and your singing/stringed skill goes up, this song will slowly heal faster and for more points per pulse. The rate of healing goes up about 2 points per pulse every 6 levels, hence lvl 12 heals at 8 points/pulse, lvl 18 heals 10 points/pulse, lvl 24 heals 12 points/pulse, lvl 30 heals 16 points/pulse, etc...
 
Level 7: Jonthan's Whistling Warsong
Effects: SELF: +STR, +AC, +Attack Speed
Skill: Singing
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  You whistle an ancient warsong
Fading Message: You stop whistling
Location: Any
Rating: 2
Analysis: For those soloing, this is an upgrade to the chant of battle song and is actually better that the 10th lvl Anthem De Arms.  This song also will increase attack speed a consistant 15 - 20%.  For example, it will reduce the delay of a longsword from 28 to 25. Of course, if you are in a party, this song should be avoided in lieu of Hymm of Restoration or Chant of Battle. Also, while this song is stackable with Anthem de Arms, the attack speed increases not stack.  FYI: This song is used for the completion of a high level Monk quest.  Apparently, they need to get a copy of this song so a NPC can 'weave' it into a piece of monk armor.  At lvl 7, It gives +5 AC, +5 STR, and +15 to 20% attack speed 

 
Level 8: Kelin's Lugubrious Lament
Effects: Target: Lower Reaction and Help
Skill: Stringed Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  You Feel Sad
Victim Sees: You feel a strong sense of loss
Fading Message: You no longer feel sad
Location: Kelethin
Rating: 4
Analysis:  This is the first of many songs that are not available in every bard guild.  At this point in a Bard's character, we must now start our journeys across the entire Norrath for songs.  This song is very good.  It causes a monster to 'become sad' and ignore you.  This is the first Bard Song that is not continuous. You can Lament several monsters, one right after the other.  Doing this, you can lure a monster from a group, one at a time.  This is similar to the Soothe spell that Enchanters and other mage classes get, but is apparently stronger, and harder to resist.  Warning: sometimes when it fails, it will tend to attract everyone (including those that are already soothed). Reduces monster reaction range to 5, Monster frenzy radius to 10, and removes monster aggressivness.
 
Level 9: Elemental Rhythms
Effects: PARTY: Protection from Magic, Cold, Fire. +AC
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  You feel an aura of elemental protection surround you
Fading Message: The aura of protection fades
Skill: Percussion Instruments
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 3
Analysis:  This is the first of the protection songs.  On a 13th lvl Bard, resistances are +9 singing, or +19 with an instrument.  This song is no longer broken.
 
Level 10: Anthem de Arms
Effects: PARTY: +Attack Speed, +STR
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  A burst of strength surges through your body
Fading Message: Your surge of strength fades
Skill: Singing
Location: Freeport, Qeynos
Rating: 4
Analysis: Basically, this is considered the next upgrade for the Chant of Battle type of songs.  In Party combat, the +Attack speed comes in handy for the tanks.  The attack speed will increase about 10%, sometimes a little bit less.  For example, it will reduce the delay of a longsword from 28 to 25. This is a great song to twist with another and should be used in almost all combat.  It will not stack with the Level 1, Chant of Battle song.  Also, while this song is stackable with Jonthan's Whistling Warsong, the attack speed increases not stack.
 
Level 11: Cinda's Charismatic Carillon
Effects: Single/Self: Add NPC faction
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  You feel an aura of enchantment wash over you
Fading Message: You feel the enchantment fade
Skill: Wind Instruments
Location: Kelethin
Rating: 2
Analysis: This song will increase by 2 levels, how a NPC will con to you.  This is very useful for doing quests where the NPC will not talk to you unless you have good enough faction.  This song will not make an NPC go agro on you, and I've never seen it resisted.  Warning, if a NPC normally cons 'scowls, ready to attack' then this song will have no effect.  Also, make sure that there is no counter/corner/table/chair/etc... between you and the NPC or the song will not work (although no error message will be given)
 
Level 12: Brusco's Boastful Bellow
Effects: SINGLE: 1-7 points damage
Skill: Singing
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 30 sec
You Start Singing:  You throw your head back and lose a great bellow
Other people see when you start singing: lets loose a great bellow
Song affects you:  You reel in pain as every bone in your body goes numb
Other people see: reels in pain
Location: Freeport, Qeynos
Rating: 4
Analysis:  This is the first single person direct damage song in the Bard's arsenal. This song, like Kelin's Lugubrious Lament, is quick.  It does its thing, then ends.  In combat, treat this song almost as a warrior's kick attack, which does similar amounts of damage.  In your average combat, you can cast this song about 10 times, which adds up to about 70 points damage.  Just like with Kelin's Lugubrious Lament, after the song effects the monster, you can immediately cancel casting, so you can do other things, like re-cast the song.  Normally, after effecting the creature, the song still goes on for about ~5 - 7 seconds.  This time is totally useless and should be avoided. When casting this song, as soon as it says "Hit for 7 points non-melee dmg", immediately cancel and recast the song, do not wait until the song ends on its own, there is no benefit.  Another lesser use of this song is to help out other people who need some assistance killing a monster.  Use this song a few times instead of getting directly involved in melee combat. Warning!  In dungeons, this song is the monster magnet of all time.  It has been known to draw monsters from totally separate rooms, through locked doors.  Be very careful with this song in delicate dungeon settings.  Does an extra point of damage per 2 levels, so does up to 9 points at 16th lvl, up to 10 points at 18th lvl, up to 11 points at 20th lvl, etc...
 
Level 13: Purifying Rhythms
Effects: PARTY: +Protection: Poison, Disease, and Magic. +AC
Skill: Percussion Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  You feel an aura of vigorous protection surround you
Fading Message: The aura of protection fades
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 3
Analysis:  This song is the same as Elemental Rhythms.  The only difference between these songs is the type of protection provided.  The level of protection is either +9 or +19, depending on whether or not an instrument is used. In particular, it appears that this song is tailored to combat the specific resistances needed to battle undead creatures.  This song is a must for combat with, mummies, zombies, and evil mages.  This song is no longer broken.

Level 14: Lyssa's Cataloging Libretto
Effects: GROUP: Identify
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Success Message:  Long forgotten knowledge sifts through your mind
Skill: Singing
Location: Erudin
Rating: 2
Unconfirmed Analysis:  The identify song was originally going to reveal the statistics of an item (Damage, Weight, Weapon Speed, AC, etc.). Verant decided, however, to leave in the Beta ability of right-clicking an item for information. The identify song is now used for revealing the lore, if any, associated with item. Lore will only be found on high magic, Artifact level , or quest item.  To obtain information about an item, you have to hold the item with your mouse.  Simply right-clicking on the item will not suffice.  Unconfirmed, this song works for the entire party. Simply sing this song, and anyone in your party that is holding an item on their cursor will have it identified.

Level 15: Kelin's Lucid Lullaby
Effects: NON-PARTY: Sleep
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you: You feel quite drowsy
Other people see: 's head nods
Fading Message: You no longer feel sleepy
Skill: Stringed Instruments
Location: Kelethin
Rating: 4
Analysis: According to any Verant description of this song, it will say "Enthrall & Nix S. List" .  Well, forget that, here is what it really does. This is an AE sleep song.  As long as this song is playing, all mobs in it's radius will 'nod'. Mobs that are asleep will just stand there, not attacking and not casting spells.  Unfortunatly, each mob that is affected by this song gets two chances to resist its effects. The first is a standard resist, which nullifies the song outright, and the second is the chance (which varies based on Bard CHA, if instrument used, level spread, etc) to just plain ignore the song.  If one of these fail, you get the standard resist message.  If the other fails, you don't get any message, except various damage messages as the now very angry mob is frenzied on you.  For the first few levels after getting this song, there will be too many resists for it to be useful.  Of all the songs, lvl 33 and under, this one will generate the most hate in a mob, outside of charm.  It's most productive use is for low level crowd control, when your group pulls too many mobs at once.  Also, the nod effect will interfere with a monster's melee attacks  as well, allowing you to get in more hits.  If used on a caster, it will interrupt their spells 100% of the time if it fails to resist.  Be warned, monsters really hate this song, more than just about anything else.

Level 16: Tarew's Aquatic Ayre
Effects: PARTY: Water Breathing
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you: Tiny bubbles of music surround your head
Fading Message: The bubbles disappear
Skill: Wind Instruments 
Location: HighHold Pass
Rating: 3
Analysis:  This is the first Bard ongoing song that uses Wind Instruments (Cinda's Charismatic Carillon is the first song that uses Wind Instruments, but it is a momentary song, it only lasts a few seconds), like minotaur horns or flutes (unifinished brass horn is not a Wind Instrument, it is Brass).  Contrary to rumors floating around, an instrument is not required to play this song.  There are no differences in effects between singing and playing this song.  The effects of this song are pretty obvious. It allows your entire party to breathe underwater. Feel like walking from Freeport to ButcherBlock? Fall off the boat?  Well, this is a nice song to have.  This song is tough to get off.  Expect numerous song failures when trying to start up, until you get a few more levels under your belt.  Also, use this song to pump up your wind instruments skill to a respectable level, in preparation for the lvl 19 invisibility song.  There are two things I find interesting about this song.  First, I find odd that for a song that is effective in water that I have to go to a high mountain pass to get it.  Two, How do play a minotaur horn or a flute underwater?  

Level 17: Guardian Rythms
Effects: PARTY: +AC & +Magic Resistance
Skill: Percussion Instruments 
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  You feel an aura of mystic protection surround you
Fading Message:  The aura of protection fades
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 3
Unconfirmed Analysis: Contrary to rumors floating around, an instrument is not required to play this song.  It gives +13 magic resistance and +4 AC when singing.  You get a lot more when played with an instrument.  Using a drum, twisting this song with the lvl 13 Purifying Rhythms, you can easily beef up a party's magic resistance to at least 50.  Good for fighting Evil Eye's and shamans.  As for the party spell shield, I really haven't seen it do too much good.  I'm not even sure what this does yet.  It doesn't appear to absorb damage or dish it out to mobs that hit.  Investigating.

Level 18: Denon's Disruptive Discord
Effects: NON-PARTY: Damage & -AC
Skill: Brass Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  Jagged notes tear through your body
Other people see: winces
Location: Freeport, Qeynos
Rating: [not rated yet]
Unconfirmed Analysis: An upgrade song to the lvl 2 "Chords of Dissonance".  While doing the same amount of damage, it additionally lowers the AC of all monsters within rage.  I have a feeling this song is very dangerous as it may cause all monsters to stop fighting everyone else and concentrate on you. Also, word of warning, just like Chords of Dissonance, this song will affect everything, including NPCs.  Please do not use this song next to a guard, or he will start attacking you.  At 30th lvl, it drops  AC 5 points and does 7 damage per tick without a horn, 14 with, and lasts for three ticks after it pulses.

Level 19: Shauri's Sonorous Clouding
Effects: PARTY: Invisibility
Skill: Wind Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  A soft mist surrounds you
Fading Message:  You become visible
Location: Erudin
Rating: 4
Unconfirmed Analysis: Group invisibility is nice.  The radius of invisibility is somewhat small, so caution.  You cannot twist this song with any other bard song.  As soon as you stop singing this song to sing another, your party returns to view. This song does not allow the party to see each other while invisible, however, it does help a little. Each party member affected by this song will be invisible, but will have a huge bouncing ball appear where they are each pulse. At 24th level or higher, there are additional particles that fan out from the ball, making predicting motion quite easy. Suggestion: Buy a flute and stand around singing Aquatic Ayre for a couple of hours, to advance your wind skill, as this song is hard to fire up with a low skill rating. Of course, if you are soloing, this song is extremely useful at getting through places like HighHold Pass, or if you are a good alignment character, helps when you are walking through Nektulus Forest.  Warning: Barbed Bone skeletons in Unrest and undead froglocks in Lower Guk will still be able to see you.

Level 20: Largo's Melodic Binding
Effects: NON-PARTY: -Attack SPD & AC
Skill: Singing
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  Strands of sold music bind your body
Other people see: is bound in strands of solid music
Fading Message:  The strands fade away
Location: Freeport, Qeynos
Rating: 3
Unconfirmed Analysis: Song effects are obvious, reducing attack speed and AC of monsters and NPCs.  This song is one of the most dangerous, but useful, songs a bard can sing. It generates a much more hateful response than just about any other song besides Lullaby, but the reduced attack speed and AC is well worth the heat, in most cases. As with most songs, this one grows with the bard, the effect becomes more and more powerful as you level.

Level 21: Melanie's Mellifluous Motion
Effects: PARTY: Short distance random teleport
Skill: Wind Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  A mellifluous melody sweeps you away
Other people see: is swept away by mellifluous melody
Fading Message:  The mellifluous melody fades
Location: HighHold Pass
Rating: 1
Confirmed Analysis: Every three seconds that this song is played; everyone in your party will be randomly teleported a short distance.  Apparently does not teleport you through walls or locked doors.  In a dungeon, this song can get you in a whole lot of trouble. Outdoos, however, with a flute in hand, it has an amazing range. From the front gate of Qeynos, one pulse can jump you to the zone line. Lots of fun, you do a silly dance while playing it, but not real practical in the real world.

Level 22: Alenia's Disenchanting Melody
Effects: PARTY: Strip Enchantment (mostly DOTs)
Skill: Stringed Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  You feel a static pulse wash through you
 Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 2
Confirmed Analysis: right now, cancel magic is very buggy, so it's usefulness will vary, but theoretically it will cancel all those nasty spells that have been cast on your party by nasty monsters.  This song has the capability of being extremely useful.  This song is no longer broken, however, it only cancels DOT type spells, mostly Necro type.  Movement and debuff songs are not removed.

Level 23: Selo's Consonant Chain
Effects: TARGET: Slow Down Target Movement & Attack Speed
Skill: Singing
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  Your voice binds chords into chains
Other people see: is surrounded by chains of music
Fading Message:  The musical chains fade
Location: HighHold Pass
Rating: 4
Confirmed Analysis: Apparently a good soloing song, as it will make monsters move slower, so you can run around them, casting direct damage songs without being hit.  Also, if a monster is trying to run away, this song will supposedly root them.  It is similar to spell snare.  Unlike other spell casters, a Bard can sing this song while running after a mob that is trying to get away, making it very useful in places like Guk and Befallen, where mobs run away, only to come back later with a quite a few of their friends for some payback. This is a great addition to a Bard's arsenal.  Also very useful to use to help un-root youself.  When rooted, simply sing this song on yourself.  You'll be able to move, but very slowly.  When chains wears off, you'll be able to move at normal movement rates, even though there'll still be a root icon on your screen.  Slows down attack speed as much as the lvl 20 Largo's Melodic Binding song.  Level 26: Angstlich's Apalling Screech for info on a widely used strategy that employs this song

Confirmed Analysis: Allows you to see invisible, as well as give you ultravision (useful for us blind humans).  This song also tends to give everything a bluish hue.  Too bad you can't use it in conjunction with the invisibility song...

Level 25: Psalm of Warmth
Effects: PARTY: Cold Protection, +AC, infravision
Skill: Singing
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  You feel protected from cold
Fading Message:  The aura fades
Location: Erudin, Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 3
Confirmed Analysis: Increases resistance to cold-based spells. It also gives a minor fire shield that will damage whoever is hitting you by 8 or 9 points per hit.  Very useful for long fights in a melee heavy group.  Sure, the damage isn't much, but it adds up over time.

Level 26: Angstlich's Apalling Screech
Effects: NON-PARTY: Fear
Skill: Brass Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  Your mind snaps in terror
Other people see: flees in terror
Fading Message:  You are no longer terrorified
Location: Kelethin 
Rating: 4
Confirmed Analysis: Will cause all monsters in it's path to flee in terror, but only for about a minute or so, then they will come back.  This is a useful song if your party is trying to run, but failing, or if a party member, unable to run, is about to die.  This is an area effect Fear spell, mentioned as a "get out of death free" song, if used at the right time.  This song would get a rating of 5, but the fear effect only lasts for about 10 seconds. Another common use for this song, includes using lvl 23, Selo's Consonant Chain as well.  The following strategy works well in outdoor areas. Find a mob that you can melee. Chain it so that it moves slower, then fear it, so that it runs away.  Whack away at the mob, twisting fear and chains until it's dead.  Warning: watch out for other mobs in the area that might get caught up in your fear song.  You could wind up with a  minor train on your hands. 

Level 27: Solon's Song of the Sirens
Effects: TARGET: Temporary Charm, Drops Magic Resist on target
Skill: Wind Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  You are captivated by the haunting tune
Other people see: 's eyes glaze over
Fading Message:  You are no longer captivated
Location: Kelethin 
Rating: 4
Confirmed Analysis: Will charm a monster for ~ 10 seconds.  During that time, the monster will respond to /pet commands.  Allows you to do things like charm DiVinn and tell him to attack Crush.  Be careful tho, because when the charm wears off, the monster will be very pissed off and will frenzy on you.  One interesting use of this song is that you can lure 1 monster from a group fairly easily. When charm wears off, just have your party attack it.  Once a monster is charmed, you have to wait until the charm wears off until you can re-charm.  There is no indication that the charm has worn off until the monster attacks you. A common use for this song after lvl 29 is to hunt hill giants, sand giants, and griffons.  Use your accelerando song to speed around a zone until you find one of the above mentioned mobs (we'll call him mob #1).  Run up to it, and whack it with a song, or melee.  Once you have it's attention, accelerando your way across the zone, looking for another mob (we'll call him mob number 2).  Once you find mob number 2, get mob #1 to run past it.  When mob #1 runs past mob #2, charm mob #1 and have it immediately attack mob #2.  Constantly twist charm and accelerando. Important: You are dealing with very dangerous mobs here, and you WILL get resists to your charm song.  Always keep accelerando up and running with a drum. Keep an eye on both mobs.  The key here is that you want your pet to win.  If it starts losing, simply stop charming it and go charm the other one.  Once your pet kills the other mob, you now have a corpse to loot, but also a very angry mob on your tail.  At this point you can either start over this entire strategy again, finish off the mob yourself if you are strong enough, or just zone (giving proper warning to everyone in the zone, of course).  The most popular uses of this strategy are to get lambent stones, which are needed for our bard armor quests, based out of the Temple of Solusek Ro.

Level 28: Crission's Pixie Chase
Effects: Target: Sleep, Drops Magic Resist on target
Skill: Wind Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  You send forth music
Other people see: 's eyes glaze over
Location: Kelethin 
Rating: 4
Confirmed Analysis: While Verant labels this song as 'mesmerize', it does NOT erase the s*-list of a monster.  This song will, effectively stun a single mob for about 10 seconds.  I keep it memmed all the time because every so often we pull 2 mobs.  Keep one of them Pixie Chase'd while killing the other.  Makes life a lot easier.

Level 29: Psalm of Vitality
Effects: PARTY: +Save vs disease. +AC
Skill: Singing

Level 30: Fufil's Curtailing Chant
Effects: Target: Damage & lower Magic Resistance
Skill: Percussion Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  You feel a static pulse engulf you
Other people see: 's hair stands on end
Fading Message:  The pulse fades
Location: Freeport, Qeynos
Rating: 3
Unconfirmed Analysis:  It does 36 damage total over three ticks (the song's duration) and drops
Magic Resist 14 points, for me at 48th, if you use a drum.  Without a drum,
it does 24 damage total, and still lowers Magic Resistance by 14. Stacks nicely with all other DOT songs.  This song is currently broken as playing with drum does not increase it's damage/effect.  I use this song because instead of having to sing bellow every single round, I can just sing this one, and it'll last for three.

Level 31: Agilmente's Aria of Eagles
Effects: PARTY: Levitation
Skill: Wind Instruments
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  The ayre lifts you from your feet
Fading Message:  You stop floating
Location: HighHold
Rating: 3
Confirmed Analysis: This song is more fun than anything else.  Great for water heavy zone like Innothule Swamp or Dagnor's Cauldron, of Ocean of Tears. When traveling, I usually twist this song with Selo's Accelerando.  Warning: if people have /follow set to you and you are running over water, they will lose you.  Apparently /follow doesn't work very well when you can move in three dimensions.  Also, if you are swimming in water/lava already and you fire this song up, you will NOT start floating above the water/lava.  Too bad, I was looking forward to this song as a way to escape falling in the lava in the Solusek dungeons.

Level 32: Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity
Effects: PARTY: Increased Mana Regeneration
Skill: Singing
Casting Time: 3 sec
Recovery Time: 12 sec
Song affects you:  Your mind clears
 Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 6
Confirmed Analysis: This is the Holy Grail song of any party with magic users.  It will allow all casters in your party to regen mana 50% faster.  This song will stack on top of itself, so if you have 2 bards, you get twice the effect.  Since Verant dramatically slowed down the rate at which casters meditate, they will do anything they can to have a bard with this song in their party.  Always keep this song memmed and you'll have no problems finding a group. Be wary tho, since advertising my mana bard status, I always seem to get into group that have 4 or more casters in them.  Go figure
