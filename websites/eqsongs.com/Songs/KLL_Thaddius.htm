I am not one with the gift of song but just a lowly healer. But I group
with a bard regularly and successfully. Some other tips, in my humble
opinion on Kelin's Lucid Lullaby, from another view.

- Be very communicative with party, inform the group when switching
targets, like when that caster type mob spawns or wanders in. If the nod
is resisted or failed vs. one of these the tide may turn ugly. If you
switch without saying so, you're opening yourself up for more attacks.
Best to have a cleric &lt;g&gt; or another guardian angel call out more
dangerous mobs so the bard may initiate the switch.

- Advise your supporting cast that since the mobs being nodded will
swarm you. Unnessecary, movement or bumping a nodded mob, while you are
attacking seems to break the song's affect. This is just an observation.

- Very important! If a mob aggro's on one of your cast...beg, plead,
bribe, lie, or holler to them to not attack it. The song will win out
over the newly aggro mob in time, but not if they continue to try and
solo it! If a new mob enters the area and is aggro, pull it into the AoE
of the song. This applies to all in the group and any noble souls who
wish to help. Tell everyone to /assist on &quot;insert your name here&quot; until
it is second nature.

- Instruct your casters if they must meditate to do so, away from the
radius of song. This area of effect is more trial and error, for the
non-bard. If something aggro's on your caster they should see above
step.

- Find a cleric. Just one who understands the healing game. Offensive
Clerics in this scenario should be ditched and quickly. I have met a few
bards who avoid this song like the plague, because of a bad cleric or
lack of one entirely. I had to throw that in! &lt;g&gt;

- Scout the surrounding area!! Scout the surrounding area!! This is
crucial in making this song work, especially indoors. The AoE of this
songs permeates walls and closed doors! Be careful! A few is fine but
not an army! Train yourself and your group first outdoors.

By the way, our group has successfully nodded 8+ mobs of roughly the
same level, our final count was 12 slain after a fight. Use discretion.
