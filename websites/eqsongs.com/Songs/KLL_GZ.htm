Hail,<br>
GZ's bard Lullaby tests on Veeshan were just completed. Here is a summary of what we found out.<br>
<br>
Using a level 40th Bard:<br>
<br>
1) Lullaby is designed so that there is a 25% resist rate on level 1 creatures, and a 35% resist rate on creatures that con White to a 40th level Bard. This rate decreases with increasing Charisma<br>
<br>
2) Lullaby is a 1 (to about 1.5) tick song. It is not effective when twisted with another song. If you plan to use this song as an Area
Mesmerize, use ONLY this song. The length is about 3-5 seconds long only.<br>
<br>
3) The main error we found was that there is no actual text message being displayed telling you the creature has resisted your Lullaby. Therefore you will only see a "Head nods" for your previous attempt then on the next 'tick' the creature (IF it resists) just attacks with no "Target has resisted your song". This is the actual problem that caused bards to think that creatures were attacking even while their heads were 'nodded'. Refer to #1 in that the effect only lasts for 3-5 seconds (1 tick worth).<br>
<br>
<br>
Some personal observations:<br>
<br>
1) The song has a LARGE radius. I am attaching a screenshot of the range that was being
affected by GZ <a href="../images/GZ_TheBard.jpg"> (Geoff the Bard in the
screenshot)</a>.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2) The song seems quite effective as long as one remembers it is NOT a multiple-tick song. Only 1 tick, so you have to keep singing it constantly for the continuous effects.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Thanks to GZ especially and the other bards who showed up!<br>
<br>
Harliquinn Whiteshadow, wondering who has that name on Veeshan!?!?</p>

Nice Screenshot, Harli. Gallanite is my bard for the day on there. I've made a copy as a
souvenir.<br>
<br>
GZ dropped several interesting tidbits during the test, and during a chat beforehand. The one that caught my attention is that the new song should be up in a week or two if it passes testing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"It provides some protection from magic, but not the MR way" is how I remember the quote.<br>
<br>
Servo. The song is continuous, but when you stop, it only lasts three or four seconds longer. Hence its no good for twisting.<br>

[Wed Jan 12 01:34:01 2000] Geoff says, 'Next song helps protect you from spells in a
completely non MR way'<br>

In the chat before hand GZ mentioned that the resist should be lower once the creature was mez'd. Not sure if that was the case. I'll post up the data and try to do a little bit of analysis tonight.<br>
<br>
As a side note: GZ had a different client than us. He actually does play a bard and is in his mid 30's, but he has always seen a resist message.<br>
He seemed pretty pissed off when he found out that the resist wasn't showing.<br>
<br>
and in case you're reading this, thanks again Geoff<br>

Additional instruments&nbsp;<br>

<br>
<br>
As another side note, GZ said that Kelin's practice lute and the small brass trumpet are both in the game, you just have to look hard.<br>
<br>
Is this another Fiery avenger? I have noticed that a few weird people sell bardic instruments (Krak in South Karana??) so maybe you need good faction with some of them to get a quest?<br>

Thanks for taking the time to do the test GZ. And for the interesting surrounding discussion.
Surprised more people didn't turn up, but I guess it is work time on the West coast.<br>
For those who missed it. The results as I understand them were.<br>
<br>
1) A resist message is missing. This is misleading. It will be fixed.<br>
<br>
2) Lull only lasts one tick. Many bards expect it to be three. Don't twist.<br>
<br>
3) Minimum resist on any mob is about 25%. About 35% on whites, much higher on reds. Good charisma lowers the chance of resist.<br>
