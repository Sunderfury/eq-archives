  <!--mstheme--></font><pre>As a level 17 bard, I've gotten, and still get, great experience from Chords
of Dissonance. It is an excellent kiting song if done properly. The
technique I use can be a bit dangerous, but the experience gain is
worthwhile.

Against most mobs, using Accelerando will gradually take you out of range of
the mob. The trick is to run in a circle. Setting yourself to autorun, and
hitting the left or right key every second or so will keep you running in a
cirle, and if done properly, the mob will be within range for your songs.
Here's the sequence of songs I use: Accelerando, Chords, Bellow,
Accelerando, Bellow, Bellow, repeat. The whole time I'm doing this, I have
my lute equipped. Half of the time, the mob is under the effects of Chords,
and adding the Bellows in really stacks up the damage. Using this technique,
I can easily kite several yellow mobs simultaneously. Also, I've made a
fortune kiting 3, 4, or 5 wisps at a clip and then selling the lightstones.
I've tried to kite multiple red mobs, but it is extremely risky. If you get
too close and one red mob stuns you, having his 2 or 3 red buddies pounding
on you can be lethal. If you're stunned too long, and Accelerando wears off,
you have to hope that you don't get stunned again while you fire it up. And
if your health drops too low, the time it takes to equip that drum for the
extra speed guarantees you'll be using Lyssa's Locating Lyric to find your
corpse.

The kiting technique is especially good against slower-moving creatures like
mummies and zombies. These can be outrun without the use of Accelerando.
Your full effort can be put into twisting Chords and Bellows, and the mobs
drop pretty quickly. It's really underestimated how much damage Chords can
do with a lute when you can keep the mob under its effect for the duration
of a fight.
