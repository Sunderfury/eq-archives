Liq's take on march of the wee<br>
</font></b><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Got this song awhile ago and
after testing it on greens solo I kinda ignored it because of the damage absorb
bringing the song down. Last night I tried playing with it in a group and found
out it's not bad at all....<br>
<br>
Evidently playing this song brings up an icon which is roughly 18 agility 14 ac
and a 12 point damage absorb. Using a selo's drum from nag, the stats are 42
agility, 32 ac and roughly a 28 point damage shield. Once the damage absorb is
used, the whole effect goes down.<br>
<br>
When I started using this song, the group I was in consisted of monk (puller),
ranger, paly, shaman, cleric and me.. all level 52. All the mobs Pulled were
between 43 and 50 in singles.<br>
<br>
What I first tried was twisting this song while killing level 43+ mobs. I
started using weapons and twisting mana/vov but found that the song was getting
knocked down as soon as it went up. When I instead went to chain casting march
alone (i.e. start and stop the same song so it refreshes every 3 seconds), the
tanks started taking a lot less damage while the mobs died faster. When I
switched to using nag's drum for extra points, the effect was even more
pronounced.<br>
<br>
After killing a mob that normally took at least one complete heal (level 49ish
bookoo hp and hits for 130ish), we found that this song made the mob concentrate
on the monk who only lost a bubble hp all fight. The cleric ending the fight at
fm was proof enough alone that there is something to this song.<br>
<br>
This was only an hours worth of testing but I so far this is my take.<br>
<br>
1. The song needs to be refreshed constantly to be of any real use.<br>
2. The drum improves the song a lot<br>
3. A shaman to slow really improves this song as you have time to put up a new
shield between hits.<br>
4. Evidently the mob was sticking to the monk when this song was playing... not
sure why exactly (I have a guess) but neither the ranger nor the paly were
taunting the mob off him. Thinking that not getting smacked around helped the
monk's damage count and hence taunt.<br>
<br>
All in all a very worthwhile song for the tank + shamenmojo group I was in. Am
thinking that slow especially is important so you have time to refresh the song.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

    </font></b>1. It is most useful at the beginning of a battle (as you can't
    heal the unwounded).<br>
    2. During a battle it only seems better than Nivs / Hymn when you are
    fighting greens (since they hit for less and less often the AC difference
    and damage absorption can often work on multiple swings).<br>
    3. It is semi useful soloing when charm/kiting with the cycle, Charm/Selo's/Wee
    (or Hymn) to reduce the damage you take when something goes wrong (unseen
    mob, lag, etc)<br>
    4. Since it uses the drum it is easiest to employ when you are in chant
    mode.<br>
    5. The damage absorption has a small chance to decrease interrupts on your
    groups casters.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
