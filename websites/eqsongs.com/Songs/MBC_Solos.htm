    <td><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Arial">If you arm yourself with some quick weapon that your
      skills are capped (I would say, perhaps some ~20 delay weapons), then
      you'll notice that singing berserker not only give you speed (slightly
      faster than Celerity, but not noticeable), it also gives you a + chance of
      hitting with dual wield.<br>
      <br>
      (To test it yourself, preferably wield 2 weapons of the same speed, e.g. 2
      FS dagger, 2 EBW, etc - so when your secondary hand attack, you'll see 2
      lines of attack instead of one.)<br>
      <br>
      I tested it myself in many occasion and proved it with EQP - I'm in fact
      hitting a LOT more with Berserker than Celerity.<br>
      <br>
      With Celerity, I'll hit with my secondary hand about 30% of the time (eg.
      3 swings from secondary hand for every 10 swings), while with Berserker,
      I'm hitting a whopping 60 to 70% of the time (6 to 7 swings from secondary
      hand for every 10 swings)<br>
      <br>
      This has been tested in many different combat with different mobs, at
      different times. Berserker always improves my chances of hitting with
      secondary weapon.<br>
      <br>
      EQP shows that when I'm using Berserker, I'm doing about 20% more damage
      over using Celerity, assuming the speed bonus difference is minimal.<br>
      <br>
      Since other class have double attack it's hard for them to see the
      difference but my SK friend did told me berserker makes his double attack
      lands more often.<br>
      <br>
      I was also told by my other bardic friends that VoV have the same + chance
      of hit as the Berserker, but not with other lower level haste songs such
      as Celerity/Anthem/CoB, etc.<br>
      <br>
      So Berserker doesn't only give str and speed bonus, it also improves our
      chance of hitting with secondary hand.<br>
