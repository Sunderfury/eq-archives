<p><tt>While the pet is charmed press F1 to toggle selection between you and the
pet. When charm wears off or the pet dies the pet can no longer be selected.<br>
<br>
A list of pet commands is as follows -<br>
/pet guard here - tells the pet to guard its current location<br>
/pet guard me - tells the pet to attack anyone that attacks it's master<br>
/pet follow me - tells the pet to follow you, but ends when you cross a zone
line.<br>
/pet attack - tells the pet to attack the selected target.<br>
/pet back off - tells the pet to stop its attack.<br>
/pet as you were - returns the pet to neutral, belaying all prior orders.<br>
/pet report health - pet gives you percentage of it's health left.<br>
/pet who the leader - pet reports who commands it (notify their party<br>
that creature is a pet).<br>
/pet get lost - makes a summoned pet kill itself.<br>
/pet taunt on/off<br>
/pet sit<br>
/pet stand<br>
Pet report health and pet who the leader can be useful, (but as the pet says
them as opposed to tells you or group say) if you are outside speaking range
then you wont hear the result. As charm<br>
doesn't give a success message the command pet who the leader can be very useful
to let your party know that you have charmed (if within speaking range anyway).<br>
<br>
If unsure how charm works ask an enchanter friend<br>
If unsure how pets work ask a magician or a necromancer friend<br>
<br>
If you are within teleport distance an ex pet may teleport to you when charm
wears off. This usually happens when indoors where pathing can be an issue. This
can be &quot;very&quot; dangerous, so just be aware of it. Aggro teleporting
mobs teleport directly into the middle of your body where they can hit you but
you can't hit them unless you move slightly.<br>
<br>
If anyone casts invis, invis vs undead or camo on you while you have a pet
charmed this will break charm instantly. This can be used to start combat
against a pet immediately.<br>
<br>
Selo's accelerando (unlike SoW) does not effect pets only player party members.<br>
<br>
Resistance check for this song is based on the bards charisma, the mob's magic
resistance (not fire, cold, poison or disease resistance) and the relative level
difference between you and the mob being charmed. The higher the charisma the
lower the chance for resistance AND the longer the chance for a full duration
charm. Better to charm blues and whites as you will get a better chance of a
full length charm. Straight from GZ<br>
<br>
Mobs with high magic resistance will resist being charmed a lot even if blue or
green. Learn these mobs through trial and error.<br>
<br>
There is a 1 in 20 automatic spell failure chance (all other things being
equal). Sometimes the odds just seem to go against you. It can be difficult to
know sometimes whether you were unlucky or the mob has a high magic resistance.
Don't judge the ability/inability to charm a particular mob on a single
instance. Give it a couple of goes at least. Best to do your experimentation
soling or with a regular partner and getting your charming routine and hot keys
sorted out before &quot;inflicting&quot; your charming ability on a group.<br>
<br>
Always tell your group that you are charming before you do it and preferably
what you are charming as well. Setting up a &quot;Charming now...&quot; hot key
is probably the simplest method.<br>
<br>
When soloing make sure that the mob being charmed is at least the same level as
the mob being attacked otherwise your pet will most likely die first. The idea
is to charm, have the pet kill another mob and then kill the pet once charm
wears off to get xp from both mobs. Exceptions to this rule are mobs like
griffawns/ons/ins/enes that have combat ability above their actual level.<br>
<br>
Yellow &amp; especially red con mobs resist more often and charm for less
duration. But they hit harder. If you have very high charisma you may wish to
&quot;try&quot; your luck. Deep reds are almost impossible to charm or even if
you do the charm lasts for such a short time that it is effectively useless.<br>
