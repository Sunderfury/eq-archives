          Ok, I suspect you've been preparing for this, so I'll warn Akriss to
          be ready to split this thing…
          <p>So let's have it. Tell me what needs balancing for bards. You may
          as well give me bugs and broken stuff too. But my focus is going to be
          on things that are needed to move bards closer to 'balanced' in the
          game. This may include a nerf or two, I want to warn you of that. I am
          just as willing to suggest a negative change that helps to achieve
          balance as a positive one.
          <p>Also, I understand that a bard is a complicated class to play. And
          I have no problem with that. This complicated nature will always mean
          that there are fewer bards in the game than other classes. I'm fine
          with that too.
          <p>Please, be detailed where you need to. Try to avoid abbreviations,
          my simian mind can't decipher many of them.
          <p>Thanks.

          <p>I was aware of it. But since I'm pretty much starting fresh here,
          give me things that you know I know, just so I don't forget to put
          them on the list.
          <p>NOR_Bard posted, but someone else wrote:
          <p>&gt;&quot;In general, melee damage triples from 50 to 60 and spell
          damage increases 50%. Bard &quot;spell&quot; damage is really a form
          of melee damage, since the damage is slow yet takes no mana. Yet for
          some reason it follows a lesser curve than regular spell damage. I
          have no idea why.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Well, because you are comparing 1 song to all of the melee damage
          done by a rogue (why not pick a warrior, or a caster?). Now, add the
          other things that the bard does into the equation, and let's talk
          further. Look at damage by twisting two songs plus the damage done by
          increasing the attack speed of that same rogue. Or look at the
          increased damage of that rogue when bard hasted, and the increased
          damage output of the wizard under the mana song AND whatever third
          song you want to sing…
          <p>I'll agree that perhaps we should look at the damage dealing
          ability of the bard. But I'm not convinced that it's too low by this
          argument, as it fails to include all the other things that a bard
          does. It's kind of like saying that an enchanter doesn't ramp up his
          damage as fast as a rogue after 50th level. Bards are not just about
          damage dealing.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Most bard songs don't get upgrades. They're designed to
          get better with level. If you take our Chant series as an example (a
          targeted DoT), from level 40 to 50, the song increases from 39 damage
          for 3 ticks to 48 damage for 3 ticks (+23%). From levels 50 to 60
          it'll go from 48x3 to 57x3 (+19%). You designed the level 50+ spells
          to represent a larger increase in power than just 10 levels.
          &quot;&lt;
          <p>Far better argument. Self contained and useful. Thanks.
          <p>&gt;&quot;- Tweak the formulae used for song effects in the 50-60
          range, to accurately reflect the large increase in
          damage/effectiveness other classes get in the 50-60 range.&quot;&lt;
          <p>This is the best balance method, I think. It keeps the balance
          within the class itself. Then we can make items that tweak that
          balance slightly later. The idea that a class would need to have an
          item just to be balanced doesn't sound right to me.
          <p>&gt;&quot;The level 35 song (Denon's Dissension) is AE pulse based
          and drains 24 mana/pulse (i.e. you lose mana every time I sing the
          song). If I chain-sing this song (restart it every 3 seconds), I need
          4x longer to drain as much mana as a like-level enchanter. It works
          out to about the same amount of time as the enchanter if you factor in
          med time, but you have to understand that an enchanter can haste and
          clarity his party before the fight, and mez extra mobs while he's
          draining mana. If I chain-sing this song, I can do *nothing* else
          except melee to contribute to the fight. Also, from level 37 to 57
          this song only increases 9% in the amount of mana drained. The
          enchanter mana drain goes from 229 to 352 in the same level range
          (+54%). The way this song scales with level needs to be improved
          *badly*.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Well, 'badly' might be an overstatement. But I can see your
          argument.
          <p>&gt;&quot;The level 57 song (Cassindra's Insipid Ditty) is single
          target and drains a laughable 1.5 mana/sec at level 57. The drain rate
          is so low that most bards mistakenly thought the song didn't drain
          mana at all. It is 21x slower than enchanter mana drain. I would need
          4 minutes to accomplish what the enchanter can do every 11 seconds. If
          you factor in meditate time, in the 4 minutes takes me to drain 350
          mana with this song, an enchanter can drain 2100 mana, sit down, and
          med back all the mana he used. If we haven't killed the mob by then.
          Consider removing or lowering the resist check as well so we can use
          it on level 63 mobs. Ditty has a wis/int debuff component so it will
          not stack with itself, and only a single bard at a raid can be using
          it on a target.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Seems like it need looking into. But keep in mind that the debuff
          component that you casually mentioned is probably considered a useful
          thing, and has to be taken under consideration when we look at this
          song.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Solution: Remove the &quot;soft cap&quot; if it exists.
          Improve the player resist rate against these high-end targets with
          maximum resist, so that there's a significant benefit to getting up
          near 255. Double-check to make sure there's no roll-over bug when
          resists exceed 255 (or whatever the max is in your code).&quot;&lt;
          <p>I know nothing! I'll look into this.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Comparing Rondo (57) to our level 54 song is a joke. If
          you're singing Rondo, a mob hitting your party on average 1.5 times
          every 3 sec will take 4 dam/sec from the damage shield. For the damage
          shield to offset the 23% loss in haste, your party must be doing less
          than 12 dam/sec melee damage for Rondo to be better than Celerity2…
          <p>…
          <p>Please either fix hastes/slows so an instrument increases them, or
          change these songs to have double their current haste/slow (optionally
          making them instrument-only).&quot;&lt;
          <p>This whole part of your discussion got completely confusing. You
          are trying to compare the haste component on a haste only song with a
          song that does several things (not just haste and damage shield). My
          first thought would be that of course the haste will be less when you
          get a ton of other bonuses with the song.
          <p>Frankly, I am very dubious of any comparison of things that are
          rather closer to apples than oranges. But I'll add the request to the
          list, and we'll hash it out internally a bit.
          <p>And, once again, comparing song with the spells for classes is a
          tough thing to do, and may not always be a fair comparison.
          <p>By the way, none of your links are complete…
          <p>&gt;&quot;- The BP is a self-only 100 point heal with a 12 second
          cast time. In 12 seconds, a level 50 bard using a Plane of Hate lute
          can heal 80 hp for each party member. I don't even know what the point
          is making the BP's heal self-only.
          <p>- The vambraces have an effect of Invigorate - a targeted stamina
          replenishment. Our level 3 song replenishes stamina for the entire
          party. Our level 34 song does it while healing and giving mana.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Ok, I can see it. The logic might have been that this is a 'free
          spell slot' for bards, but since you will have that song memorized to
          help your party, the clickable effects are not really useful.
          <p>&gt;&quot;- The boots summon 1 water at a time with a 5 second cast
          time. PLEASE change this to summon 10 or 20 at a time so it's at least
          useful. As it is, I just buy my water in bulk instead of taking 2
          minutes to summon a stack of water that'll all disappear every time I
          go linkdead.<br>
          - The greaves summon 1 food at a time. See boots above.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Welcome to the world of magicians…
          <p>Here I find it very easy to argue that not all items are supposed
          to be super useful. These two can save you a trip to town and allow
          you to put it off until a more convenient time. It's certainly not the
          most awesome effect in game, but that's not really a good argument.
          <p>&gt;&quot;For the other classes that get it, Kunark armor effects
          give them something they didn't have before.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Here is where you get yourself in trouble with me. I do not like
          the idea that classes now have the ability to do things they were not
          intended to do by the use of items. I am strongly against such items,
          and their existence is certainly not going to convince me to ask that
          more such things go into the game.
          <p>&gt;&quot; I suspect the same thing is happening with the Velious
          bard armor effects. Currently the Melodic BP right-clicks Song of
          Travel. Song of Travel has 12 second duration and an invis component
          so it drops every time you right-click to re-activate it. Since you
          have to re-activate it every 12 seconds, it's dropping every 12
          seconds. It's pretty silly to put this on an item as an effect
          (actually, it's pretty silly to make right-click effects out of any
          song that bards usually leave playing, since you have to refresh it
          every 12 seconds).&quot;&lt;
          <p>Now that's an idea (even if you don't actually state it). Make the
          benefit of these items that the duration is a lot longer, so that
          these songs don't need to be resung once started. I don't know how
          that would work balance-wise, or if it's possible in the game. But I'm
          much more in favor of that than giving bards the powers of other
          classes through items.
          <p>&gt;&quot;This nerf affects us even when we aren't fearing, and you
          didn't compensate us for it in any way.&quot;&lt;
          <p>To be fair, you should know that this is a red flag for me.
          Compensation for a needed change (even if it was a nerf) is never
          something I will support. Show me how this change unbalanced the class
          or something, but don't tell me that you deserve more power because
          something was taken away… if it was made weaker, it was because it
          needed to be weaker. There is no compensation.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Chain, Largo's Absonant Binding (51), and Assonant Strane
          (L54 AE movement slowdown) are all random in duration. They could last
          the full 12 seconds, they could wear off immediately. No other movent
          slowdown spells in the game have a random duration, even though the
          spell versions last 10-50 times longer than Chain. It can't be because
          Chain has a slow component attached because no other slow spells in
          the game have a random duration either. I hear all the movement
          slowdowns except the level 1 snare used to be random duration, and
          were gradually changed to have a fixed guaranteed duration - except
          the bard ones.&quot;&lt;
          <p>A logical enough argument. And you weakened it with this last line:
          <p>&gt;&quot;In light of the above one-sided nerf, perhaps you could
          give these songs a guaranteed 12 second duration?&quot;&lt;
          <p>But it does not invalidate your point.
          <p>&gt;&quot;There's also an infrequent bug that affects all the
          movement debuff spells. If you try to chain/snare/darkness a mob
          that's already begun fleeing, sometimes the spell/song will land but
          will have no effect (if this happens, repeated attempts to
          chain/snare/darkness it will have no effect). Due to the random
          duration of Chain, bards are the ones who get bit by this one the
          most.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Never heard of it. I'll list it and see if I can get someone to
          look into it.
          <p>&quot;Generally what I found is that power for all classes rises
          proportional to level squared, except for bards. For bards power rises
          proportional to level.&quot;
          <p>And he may have been right. But also, keep in mind that most bard
          songs remain useful for the life of the bard. This is completely
          unique to the class, and requires a completely different scheme of
          increasing power.
          <p>&gt;&quot;At high levels, that margin simply doesn't exist. The 10%
          haste on the level 60 song doesn't come anywhere close to giving us
          the 45% haste advantage that's needed to keep us in line with the
          other melee classes.&quot;&lt;
          <p>One of us is making a logical error here... Bardic hastes are not,
          primarily, designed to make the bard into damage dealer comparable to
          a warrior. That's not the intent. The intent is that the bards can
          improve the melee ability of his entire group by that amount. Keep in
          mind, bards were designed from the ground up to be a party based
          class.
          <p>&gt;&quot;You need to make sure the people designing this stuff
          understand that bards are a plate class.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Just because a bard CAN wear plate, that does not mean that all of
          the armor pieces designed for bards MUST have plate armor class.
          That's a false assumption. I agree that the designers need to keep the
          idea in mind, but don't go overboard.
          <p>&gt;&quot;OTOH, if you just don't want bards picking any high level
          locks, leave the cap as is, but give us the skill at about level 10.
          That way it's at least usable by low level bards in Befallen and
          Najena. I'm not sure why you'd want to do this though, seeing as
          rogues already have several ability monopolies (backstab, pick pocket,
          invis+invis to undead, poisons).&quot;&lt;
          <p>*sigh*
          <p>Well, of course rogues have a skill monopoly on basckstab, pick
          pockets… this is another one of my pet peeves. I LIKE the idea that
          classes remain unique. Telling me that bards somehow deserve a skill
          just because rogues have it is silly.
          <p>I'll add the pick lock cap to my list…
          <p>&gt;&quot;Song of Shields (49) has no message. It went from bad
          (spamming us with a buff message for each group member), to worse (no
          message at all). Please put in a single line message (flagged bard
          song so others can filter it) just like all our other songs.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Seems like this needs fixing.
          <p>&gt;&quot;The &quot;song ends&quot; &quot;song starts&quot;
          &quot;song ends&quot; bug is still around. I understand you're aware
          of it and trying to track it down. I can verify that it's a
          server-side problem, not a client-side one. If it happens to a damage
          shield song, I do not get the benefit of the damage shield.<br>
          I also suspect the bug can also happen to mobs, who then unwittingly
          benefit. Several bards (including me) have noticed that sometimes
          we'll successfully re-charm a mob, get the &quot;You don't have a pet
          to command&quot; message, and 12 seconds later get the &quot;Your
          charm has worn off&quot; message. It sure sounds like the same bug
          only happening with a debuff on the mob.&quot;&lt;
          <p>I can't believe this is still around. I'll add it.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. Bards don't
          benefit from any form of mana regen, so 800 mana takes 40 minutes to
          regenerate sitting, 80 minutes to regenerate standing. The song does
          about 311-340 points AE damage to a maximum of 4 targets. Could you
          please reappraise the mana cost on this song? We can't meditate so if
          you factor in sitting mana regen time, this song does best-case (4
          targets) 0.6 dam/sec.&quot;&lt;
          <p>But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana,
          with the exception of the use of this song. So I don't see this as a
          big problem. All it does is determine how many times you can use the
          Dirge in any given time period. Unlike other casters, it does nothing
          to prevent you from using all of your other songs.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Aria of Eagles (31, levitate) and Song of Travel (51)
          don't give any message when they're about to expire. You removed the
          message in response to complaints about the spam (we were constantly
          getting the message even with the song playing). The correct fix is to
          increase the duration of these songs by one tick so the message isn't
          generated for at least one tick, by which time the song's next pulse
          will refresh it. You had this correct fix in place with Aria. Then you
          removed the message entirely from both songs when you
          &quot;fixed&quot; Song of Travel.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Makes sense.

          <p>&gt;&quot;What 'negative changes' do you have in mind Absor?&quot;&lt;
          <p>Well, I'm already planning on complaining about the lute that
          allows bards to change into werewolves. And if anything else comes up,
          I'll add it to my list. Right now, that's the only thing I have that I
          know of.

          <p>I wanted to get this out of the way.
          <p>The groups that are asking you exclusively to play the mana song,
          they are your fault, at least in part.
          <p>You need to educate these groups about all of the other things you
          can do. There is little doubt in my mind that just playing the mana
          song is not the best use of a bard's skills. You need to show these
          groups the value of a bard.

          <p>This will sound rather nasty, and perhaps it is. But did you even
          read my post? Please, oh please, show me where I said that bards must
          receive negative changes. If you're going to criticize me, please at
          least be accurate about it.

          <p>Ok, on the list. Another one that should already have been fixed.
          <p>&gt;&quot;3. Song instance creation at the same point that old

          <p>I consider this a very minor bug. It can't be very common. But I'll
          add it to the list.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Long memorization for songs<br>
          Please explain why bards take so much longer than casters to mem
          songs. I would<br>
          appreciate smaller memorization times (this might be a small
          issue)&quot;&lt;
          <p>Easy to explain. It's because your meditation is so low. I'll add
          an increase to the meditation cap to the list.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Skill caps on defensive skills&quot;&lt;
          <p>From what I'm hearing, bards, paladins and shadow knights are all
          'defensive' hybrids. I'll add a suggestion to increase the defense
          caps of all three to the lists.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Epic Quest<br>
          The entire bard epic is great up to the point where we have to kill 3
          dragons. I dont<br>
          believe any other class has to do this in addition to everything else
          we do. Also we must<br>
          compete with paladins and warriors, (possibly others) for a shot at
          the scales.&quot;&lt;
          <p>On the list.
          <p>&gt;&quot;Song stacking<br>
          You simply need to fix the stacking problem. I hate having to
          constantly stop cantina for<br>
          clarity or regen songs. I hate playing level 50 song and having the
          enc wonder why sos<br>
          isn't sticking. Quite simply make it so bard songs dont prevent songs
          from being casted,<br>
          and prevent a slower bard haste effect from ruining a better haste
          effect. &quot;&lt;
          <p>Ok, on the list.
          <p>&gt;&quot;. When a bard stops singing, people see &quot;%t's song
          ends&quot;. TWICE.&quot;&lt;
          <p>That must be a pain…
          <p>&gt;&quot;Basically, bard charm VERY OFTEN goes into
          &quot;effect&quot;, IE you get the message, and you can't charm
          anything else, but you have no real control over the creature. The
          problem is that your pet will not attack you, but frequently attacks
          your other party members, and of course, your other party members
          can't effect your pet and you can't control it. It is one of the most
          annoying bugs I've encountered, and it isn't being fixed.&quot;&lt;
          <p>Messy. I'll put it on the list.

          <p>Sorry, it's late and I’m getting silly.
          <p>I'm also going to add the whole twisting thing to the list. Maybe
          someone can come up with a way to make it so that bards can twist
          without all the annoying and tiring button pushing. But that may not
          be possible.
          <p>&gt;&quot;…but how can you in all fairness suggest any sort of a
          nerf without having tested it for yourself&quot;&lt;
          <p>If you would like, I can always just ignore player input until I
          have had the time to level every class up to 60th level and become
          qualified enough to understand what people tell me…
          <p>There is a reason that I never tell people what classes I play, and
          to what level. It's the same reason that I never ask anyone what level
          they have played their class to, or what class they play (though
          players often include that information regardless). It is possible to
          understand the mechanics of EverQuest without actually having ever
          played the game. Any well thought out argument can easily be proven. I
          am willing to accept what you tell me as truth if it makes sense. I
          would hope that you would accept what I say only if it makes sense and
          not based on what characters I have or have not played.
          <p>If it makes sense for improving game balance, I will suggest it to
          the team, whether it is a nerf or not.

          <p>I think I missed listing this. Adding 'more mid-level quests and
          instruments' to the list. But this isn't really a balance thing. And I
          doubt that a lot of content will come out of these lists. But we'll
          bring them to the attention of the team for future consideration.

          invisible to me…
          <p>As I said at the start of this post (I think) and in the other
          threads, I am primarily looking for balance issues. But I will most
          certainly note bugs that are pointed out to me.
          <p>And I DO have the secret bard decoder ring, so don't think that
          your Jedi mind tricks will work on me.

          <p>Here's how it goes.
          <p>Bards, shadow knights and paladins are the defensive hybrids and
          they get the defensive stuff. They will not get both double attack AND
          dual wield. Rangers are the offensive hybrid, and they get both skills
          (I think…) and in exchange they lose out on the defensive skills.

          minute recast, I dont know of a single Bard that keeps it memorised.
          222 damage is an extremely small ammount of damage to require such a
          long recast. A huge delay reduction would be required to make it
          usefull, something in the neighborhood of an 12 second
          recast.&quot;&lt;
          <p>That does seem like a long recast.

    ------------------------------<br>
    *Baltimore Fan Faire - Last Chance*<br>
    Monday is the registration deadline for the Baltimore Fan Faire! We are</font>
    <font SIZE="2">almost sold out so hurry and visit&nbsp;<br>
    <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html</a>
    before you miss</font> <font SIZE="2">your chance to attend this event!</p>
    <p>*Patch Day*<br>
    The primary focus of today's patch is to implement changes noted in the new
    Producer's Letter which can be found at<br>
    <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml">http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml</a></p>
    <p>It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you read the Producer's Letter before
    playing EverQuest. It contains some unprecedented and exciting enhancements
    to gameplay.</p>
    <p>In addition to these changes, the following changes have been
    implemented:&nbsp;<br>
    *Bug Fixes*<br>
    <b>- Fixed a bug that caused &quot;root&quot; and &quot;snare&quot; type
    spells to function incorrectly when stacked. They should now stack properly.</b><br>
    <b>- Fixed a bug that negated the &quot;instrument modifier&quot; for bards
    using Selo's, causing them to run slower than they otherwise&nbsp; would.<br>
    - Fixed a bug that allowed two or more spells that grant levitation to
    stack. Levitation spells should not stack.<br>
    </b>- The &quot;Track Corpse&quot; spell now works.<br>
    - Tracked down and eliminated several bugs that were causing a very small
    percentage of people to crash when zoning or upon entering the game.<br>
    - Fixed a problem with some Ulthork armor that caused it to disappear on
    death if the wearer was of extremely low level.<br>
    - Tserrina's Whip has been fixed. If you received one prior to today's
    patch, you will need to trade out your whip with a GM in order to get one
    that works correctly.<br>
    - Last week's patch attempted to fix Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing,
    and Torpor, so that they would stack another similar spell, unintentionally
    causing it to stop stacking with standard regeneration spells. This has been
    fixed. The downside to this fix is that these spells will now</font> <font SIZE="2">overwrite
    the &quot;Call of Bones&quot; series. As the three former spells are cast to
    save a character's life, this solution appears to be the most beneficial for
    all of those involved.<br>
    - The stronger /lootnodrop options will no longer prompt you for
    confirmation when looting your own corpse. It is highly suggested that
    everyone reset their option to the strongest security available: /lootnodrop
    ALWAYS (always ask for confirmation).<br>
    - Added some code to address an issue reported by a few players, that being
    that an NPC named &quot;Ragefire&quot; would die and not leave a corpse.
    Though we were unable to reproduce this problem in testing, the code we
    added should function as a catch-all for this problem. Please be sure to let
    us know how this goes.</p>
    <p>*Changes/Enhancements*<br>
    - While not mentioned in the Producer's Letter, the Zone Experience Modifier
    has also been increased in Guk (guktop), by roughly 12%.<br>
    - &quot;Lay on Hands&quot; has been enhanced again to heal more hitpoints.<br>
    - Overlooked in the last patch message, new spells were made available to
    Rangers and Paladins in the upper levels.<br>
    - &quot;Voice of the Berserker&quot;, a beneficial spell, no longer drains
    mana over the duration of the spell.<br>
    - The maximum duration of &quot;Strength of Nature&quot; has been increased.<br>
    - A new spell for magicians is now available in game.<br>
    - The &quot;Shield of the Eighth&quot; spell will now last a number of
    minutes equal to your level.<br>
    - You can now use the arrow and enter keys to select characters in the
    character select screen. In addition, the last character you chose will be
    automatically hilighted when entering that screen. This value is stored in
    the EQCLIENT.INI file as &quot;LastCharSel=0-7&quot;<br>
    - The ranger's &quot;Trueshot&quot; discipline has had its damage increased
    after analyzing data from its fix last week. Prior to the last patch, all
    bows, while under the discipline, were hitting as if they were 45dmg bows
    regardless of the delay. Last week's patch fixed it so that damage was based
    on the damage of the bow. This weeks patch increases damage bonuses in
    relation to delay (longer delays yield better damage bonuses).<br>
    - You can now reverse the left and right channels on your speakers using the
    /reversesound command. This should be very useful for those who have had to
    place their speakers backwards due to cable lengths.<br>
    - Made some improvements to Paw, Mistmoore, and The Hole, to address some
    concerns brought forth by the players. Both zones had some problems that
    would cause them to be exceedingly difficult in some cases.</p>
