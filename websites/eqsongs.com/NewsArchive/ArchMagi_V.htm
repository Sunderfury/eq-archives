<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Q: A few months after release,
there was a speed cap put on Selo's due to cheaters. Was this Intentional?</b>
<p>A: When our speed cap was put on, it was discovered that Bards with
exceptional magic drums were breaking the speed limit that we had set back in
Beta. In effect, they were moving faster then the fastest we ever planned for
players to move. So yes, the speed cap for cheaters brought their speed down a
small percentage.

<br>
<b>Q: Charm limited to level 37 and below mobs. Our charm is already very
limiting, why the level limit?</b>
<p>A: We are very careful which classes we give charm to in EQ - so much so that
we actually removed the ability from some classes post Beta. Bards are the only
class, other then the Enchanter, which can charm all types of creature.
<p>We are currently kicking around another higher level Bard Charm song for one
of the empty level slots. If we do put it in, it will be different from
Solon’s - but still cool
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<b>Q: A Bard’s Dodge caps at 120, and they get no parry or riposte. Why?
(Class Balance is a fine answer, just checking)</b>
<p>A: Bards have much better, and much more unique, magical abilities then those
of any other Hybrid class. Because of this, their melee skills are not as good
as the typical Hybrid. Bards melee still better then any non-melee class - their
offense, weapon skills, hit points and two-weapon fighting are superior to that
of any priest or magi type.
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<b>Q: Using some Magic instruments, for example, the Darkwood Piccolo, have no
effect.</b>
<p>A: High Quality Instruments always bump up the effect of a song. Some songs,
however, don’t have effects that can be bumped up - for example, Tarew’s
Aquatic Ayre gives the ability to breathe water. Having a magical instrument
will not make you breathe water “better.” The Piccolo, a wind instrument,
has the least number of songs that have effects which can be increased. Most
Wind songs tend to be all or nothing.

<br>
<b>Q: I have never seen a &quot;Your target has resisted your attempt to
mesmerize it&quot; while using lullaby, as per your post. When should I?</b>
<p>A: I believe that went in last patch. If not, it should be in this one. You
will see the resist message when your target resists your song. This not showing
was a display error - it should have been fixed long ago. It took a while
because when some of us (not all of us, just some) play, we use a version of the
client that provides more information/messaging. This lets us catch a lot of
bugs that most people might not see. It makes tracking down bugs a lot easier,
quicker, and more efficient. On the downside, it sometimes isn’t always easy
to remember which messages everybody sees, one which only we see. This was one
of the few cases where too much information caused the problem.
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<b>Q: Will twisting ever be coded against? I.e. is it considered cheating? If it
is, I definitely want to know about it now.</b>
<p>A: Twisting is not cheating. It won’t be coded against. We are even looking
at putting a little something extra in to help the people with slower machines
twist better, while not allowing those with faster machines to twist more often.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: The time it takes to memorize a song should be decreased.</b>
<p>A: We put in some code last patch to help with that.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Why don't we know what instrument type songs take when we look at them in
our songbook? It's very frustrating when you do not remember which instrument is
used.</b>
<p>A: This is something we have planned to add for a while. New display code
should hopefully be going in some time soon.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: If any instruments raise song effectiveness, can you please have that
listed when we examine it?</b>
<p>A: Using an instrument will always increase the effect of a song - assuming
that type of song can be increased by an instrument (example: Any set of Drums
will make you run faster when playing Selo’s Accelerando). Some instruments
will increase your effect more then others. The same new display code that is
going in to help with the Song/Skill identification will also display instrument
bonus/penalties.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: In the expansion, the level cap will be changed and we will presumably get
more songs. Will our bard singing skills have a higher skill cap? For that
matter, why are our bard skills capped at 200? Songs are our lifeblood and an
integral part of this class.</b>
<p>A: Almost every skill in EverQuest is capped at 200. There are, of course,
some exceptions - but the vast majority of EQ skills range from 1-200.
<p>That being said, if the level caps go up, you can safely assume that Bard
Skills will increase with it.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Is there a reason why the Bard's mana song cannot be twisted? Perhaps
because of game balance again?</b>
<p>A: There is a common assumption that ALL Bard songs last for 3 “ticks.”
This is not true. Many songs last for shorter and longer durations. The Bard’s
mana song is one with a shorter duration. For more details, see Volume III of
the Arch-Mage answers.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: While I understand the idea that Druidic and Shaman SOW effects cannot be
used indoors (I even understand the Journeyman boots), I don't understand why
the Bard running song not working indoors.</b>
<p>A: Game Balance. No spell or effect that speeds up a character will work
indoors. Period.
<p>During Beta we found that indoor use of movement increasing spells and songs
led to trains on a massive scale. When we took out the movement effect songs,
the amount of trains happening in dungeons significantly decreased. This was
one, of many, reasons that we will never have movement increasing spells or
songs able to be cast in dungeons.
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<b>Q: Denon's Desperate Dirge - is it really that &quot;desperate?&quot; After
all, the Bard does 300 damage to himself to do 300 damage to all MOBS in a
certain radius around him. That's really cool, except 300 damage is absolutely
nothing. Casters have been doing that since level 30, and Bards get a song that
does that at level 43. Plus, this one actually uses all the Bard's mana so it's
a one shot deal.</b>
<p>A: The 300 damage is only done if you target something near yourself - this
is an AoE song, and like all other AoE effects, if the caster stands too close,
they get hit with their own effect. Ask any Wizard. As for the amount of damage
dealt - Bards do not have large damage songs - their songs are more of a gradual
thing, dealing damage over time. This song breaks the rules for Bards - it deals
a large (for them) amount of damage instantly. This is why they can sing it very
infrequently (i.e. it takes up all their mana).
<p>Bards were actually never intended to have any songs that took mana. Using
mana on this one was just a convenient way to mark off time for how often they
could use the song.
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<b>Q: What kind of condiment taste best on Wood Elf Bards?</b>
<p>A: Around here, we go for barbecue sauce. To paraphrase one of the other game
designers, “it really brings out that nice smoky wood taste.”
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: You mentioned previously that adding an extra tick to bard DoT songs would
make them 50% more powerful. Why not simply add to the damage each tick does
instead?</b>
<p>A: Solid suggestion.
<p>The reason that we did not increase the damage for Bard songs is that,
honestly, most Bards don’t kite with their DoT songs. The Bellow is an instant
- so it is unaffected by movement / kiting. Chords and such are good songs - but
we do not want to increase the damage that they deal every tick for the 5% or so
of the time that movement might lower their damage.
<p>Bards are also the only class that can move and sing/cast a song at the same
time. Every other class must be standing still before they can produce a magical
effect. Increasing the damage done by Bard songs, purely for purposes of making
them even better Kiters, is against the spirit of the reason that we put in the
anti-kiting code in the first place.

<br>
<b>Q: In 82 days of play my most ingrained behavior is to switch between weapons
and instruments slowly and with the utmost care for fear of dropping something.
Will a yes/no confirmation window or an item drop toggle be added to prevent us
from dropping weapons?</b>
<p>A: We are looking into doing this. No promises, but, again, solid suggestion.
<p>BTW - 82 days? Very impressive. (And no, please don’t everybody e-mail me
your played times - we love you all regardless of how many days of play time you
have).
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Why did you make all the weapons in plane of hate for bards pretty much
the exact same thing except for its weapon type.</b>
<p>A: There were a few items added to Hate Plane for Bards. Three of them were
originally designed to be dropped from the same monster - the three identical
Bard weapons. They were made identical so that no matter which weapon a Bard had
chosen to train up in (1HS, 1HB or Piercing), they would have a good weapon to
chose from. During the tuning and testing phase of Hate, these weapons got split
up and placed on different monsters.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Why didn’t you make the attack speed songs of bards stack with other
spells.</b>
<p>A: No attack speed spells or songs stack with each other either. Each player
can h ave a total of two haste effects on them - one from an item, and one from
a spell/song.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Does AC matter for a bard?</b>
<p>A: Yes. A better AC is always worth having. It means that you get hit for
less damage.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Can you PLEASE make our songs attract less mobs? I cant even sing in
planes during a fight because all the mobs will go aggressive on me!! So I get
turned into a mediocre tank.</b>
<p>A: We reduced the Bard song taunt factor a bit this/last patch. Sometimes,
however, discretion is the better part of valor. I know many Bards that leave
their songs playing, regardless of the situation. There are times when you want
to stop singing, in the same way that there are times when a Cleric may not want
to attract attention by Healing, or a Wizard may not want to attract attention
with their DD spells.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Our dispel magic song is a very nice song, but can you make it more like
nullify magic? By the time we get this song, we can’t dispel a lot of the
buffs. Is there a reason for this?</b>
<p>A: Check the patch message - Syvelian’s has gotten a bit more powerful.
That being said, all magic effects can be dispelled. Some are just harder then
others. The difference in levels between the caster and the person casting the
cancel does make a difference. What the “better” cancel magic spells do is
add to your effective level for purposes of the comparison.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Why do we not have the ability to play Invisibility and See Invisibility
songs together? Or perhaps allowing our see invisible to be played on top of a
casters invisible or camouflage?</b>
<p>A: Any effect that hits you while invisible turns you visible. We recently
added the See Invisible component to the Bard’s invisibility song - this
should help the problem. (Or you can just follow the cool sparkles…)
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Can you give us some way to increase faction (when we have a god) so that
Guise is worth using?</b>
<p>A: Try using Cinda’s Charismatic Carillon - the song increases your faction
with that of the targeted creature.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Is Kellin's Lucid Lullaby (Lvl 15) supposed to have a memory blur
component?</b>
<p>A: Nope.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Ok this is a personal question and probably completely trivial, the
enameled black chestplate from lower guk is a black plate that is wearable by
all the plate wearing classes except Bard. I wear an inferior black plate
because I like the black plate look, can this plate be made available to Bards?</b>
<p>A: No reason. I changed it so that Bards can use it too - should be in this
patch.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Recently, the range on Brusco's Boastful Bellow (level 12 song) was
drastically reduced, leaving bards with, for all intents and purposes, no ranged
attack. There are times when my bard cannot bellow a mob that is actually within
aggro range, because it is &quot;too far away&quot;.</b>
<p>A: We didn’t change it. I double checked my database just to be sure, and
the range is what it has always been (half the range of a Wizard style DD
spell).
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Are there enhanced effects for these songs when the proper instrument is
equipped? In the case of Aquatic Ayre, is the enhancement range increased? For
Sirens and Pixie Strike, does it increased duration, chance of success, or both?</b>
<p>A: Instruments only effect the primary effects of the song (healing, buff,
attack speed, etc.) - not the range/duration/chance of success, etc.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: If a player is targeted when the level 26 screech (area fear) is started,
a message is displayed that this sort of spell cannot be cast on players. Is
this &quot;feature&quot; intended?</b>
<p>A: All player classes lost the ability to Fear (or anything else that causes
the AI to take over your character) other PCs. This was, sadly, due to a few
people who were really abusing it. They spoiled it for everybody.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: First I would like to know why you made bards hybrids. I mean I see
rangers ( druid/warrior), Paladins (cleric/warrior), and ShadowKnights (necro/warrior),
but a Bard is a rogue/?</b>
<p>A: Bards are Hybrids (by classification) because they more closely resemble
the Paladin/SK/Ranger then any other group of classes.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Can you explain your thoughts behind Psalm of Purity and Psalm of
Vitality? These songs are simply useless since any 5th level druid and 4th level
cleric can cure the disease and poison these songs are supposed to protect from.
I mean truly 39 points of disease protection for a 29th level song?</b>
<p>A: These songs, in addition to protecting from poison and disease, also have
chances to remove a poison or disease effect on you. They are a mixture of a
cure and a resistance buff in one.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Alenia’s Disenchanting Melody. It will remove all buffs/deduffs except
Necromancer and ShadowKnight spells. If this song gets rid of a 49th level buff
it darn sure should get rid of a 14th level infectious cloud or steal strength.
Again these spells are counteracted by 4/5th level spells from a druid or
cleric. Could you explain why it doesn't?</b>
<p>A: Alenia’s Disenchanting Melody will get rid of magical effects - but it
will not get rid of poison or disease effects (no cancel magic style spell will
get rid of a poison or disease effect). For that you need a Cure - or a Psalm.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Do you believe Dissension the Mana Draining Song is actually useful
against a Monster? What scenarios do you envision it being used and can this
actually be done in game?</b>
<p>A: My favorite is to use it against single, large mobs that you don’t want
casting lots of spells. Vox is a good example - the less mana she has, the less
Complete Healing spells she can cast.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: I notice that Charisma affects all of the Mind based songs as far as
resists are concerned. My question is what statistics affects the resists of the
Direct Damage and Damage over time songs.</b>
<p>A: No statistic effects damage songs. Charisma is special in making mental
based songs / spells harder to save against. One of the reasons that this was
done was to give an extra benefit to classes / races that have higher Charismas.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: The radius on Selo's Accelerando should be doubled.</b>
<p>A: I agree. That should be in next patch.
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<b>Q: As a Wood Elf Bard, my Forage skill gets capped at 40 regardless of the
fact that my heritage as a Wood Elf has trained me better. Is it intended to be
so that as a bard I LOSE that heritage?</b>
<p>A: That’s silly. I’ll see what I can do.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Why are some 2H Slashing weapons usable by bards but our skill is capped
at 0?</b>
<p>A: Bards were never slotted to get 2H weapons. They have no ability to skill
in it from a Guild Master, nor do they ever actually get the skill. There is a
display error, however, at the Bard Guild Master which shows that the skill is
trainable.
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<b>Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the following:
Cinda's Charismatic Carillon, Tarew's Aquatic Ayre, Solon's Song of the Sirens,
Crission's Pixie Strike, and Agilmente's Aria of Eagles?</b>
<p>A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance, none.
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<b>Q: I play a shaman. This is perhaps a bit off the mark, but I was wondering
what are the best buffs for a bard? For example, I recently discovered … that
dexterity helps a bard, as does charisma. Any other buffs that a wise bard
should be asking for?</b>
<p>A: Charisma and Dexterity are the best Buffs. Most Bards that I know can also
always use a few more points of strength - their armor usually puts them
dangerously close to encumbrance. AC &amp; HP buffs are also nice - most
denizens of Norrath have an inexplicable hatred of music and tend to take it out
on nearby minstrels.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: We have one song that only affects the bard only, called Jonathan’s
Whistling Warsong. Why haven’t we seen similar songs at higher levels?</b>
<p>A: Most Bard songs are designed to be grant group effects rather then
personal buffs. Jonthan’s Warsong was put in to give lower level Bards a boost
at a time where they needed one. We could certainly add another higher level
version of the song, but I have a feeling that it just wouldn’t be used that
much.
<p>&nbsp;
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../_themes/artsy/arthsepa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<br>
<b>Q: Because we can be interrupted while being attacked or experiencing lag,
were there any thoughts on increasing the duration of
levitation/invisibility/water breathing? No one in his or her right mind would
ask a bard to perform these songs in combat situations. A great set of group
songs that need a little more work.</b>
<p>A: This is something that I have been running some tests on recently. There
is a decent chance that we will add a tick or so to the duration of each of
these songs. It won’t overpower them, but it will make them easier to use in
most situations.
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<b>Q: It seems the level 34 song Solidarity of Vision may have a use, but its
duration is to short. Do you plan to increase it?</b>
<p>A: I think that did receive a slight duration boost. It should be going in
this patch or the next one - not sure which.</p>
