    May 25th, 8:00am<br>
    --------------------<br>
    <br>
    *Patch Day*<br>
    <br>
    Greetings all! The following changes have been implemented on the Live
    servers:<br>
    <br>
    *Spells/Songs*<br>
    <br>
    - Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly
    saving versus resistance to cold. It now appropriately saves versus magic.<br>
    <b>- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target
    instead of damaging it. This has been corrected.</b><br>
    <br>
    *Items*<br>
    <br>
    The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its
    weight decreased substantially.<br>
    <br>
    The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has
    been restricted to Monks only. The statistics on this staff are much more
    powerful than normally allowed for warriors. This change is retroactive and
    will be reflected on items currently in inventory. Though we strive to avoid
    negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented
    a balance issue, making the change necessary. We apologize to warriors that
    currently own this weapon.<br>
    <br>
    <b>A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report &quot;Item
    out of charges&quot;, has been corrected. Due to the dynamics of this
    particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this
    item out for a new, properly working version of the item.</b><br>
    <br>
    The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced. In addition to an
    increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect. The lightsource
    effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be
    &quot;sneaky&quot; :)<br>
    <br>
    The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.<br>
    <br>
    *General Changes*<br>
    <br>
    - Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level.
    They have been adjusted.<br>
    - Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep. NPCs and pets should
    have a much easier time of navigating the zone.<br>
    - Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These
    issues have been corrected.<br>
    - A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance
    of Research have been corrected. All practice-rune recipes should now work
    correctly.<br>
    - Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly
    reflects their undead status.<br>
    - Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.<br>
    - /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.<br>
    - Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed
    to start their character in Cabalis. They were never actually allowed to
    create the character there, however the indication that they could has been
    fixed.<br>
    - Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in
    certain cases.<br>
    <br>
    We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which
    music does not currently work. There are 55 small files (around 2K each)
    that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of
    the affected zones.<br>
    <br>
    The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized. Certain aspects of
    the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the
    reward should be well worth the risk. Feel free to visit this zone and
    search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on
    Monday.<br>
    <br>
    Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience
    being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons). The affected zones
    have been updated, and adventurers should notice the greater experience
    reward in return for the increased risk and challenge associated with these
    zones.<br>

    listed though:<br>
    May 16th, 10:00am<br>
    -------------------<br>
    ***Patch Day***<br>
    <br>
    *General Changes*<br>
    <br>
    - Sounds have been updated for NPCs in Kunark. Your Iksar should no longer sound like humans.<br>
    - Dark Elven worshipers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane will no longer be natively KOS to the outpost in the
    Overthere. Take care that if you have taken actions allowing you to be judged sufficiently by your deeds, you may still find yourself KOS.<br>
    - Increased the number of frightfingers in the Plane of Fear. Previously only 3 frightfingers would pop per
    respawn.&nbsp;<br>
    - Several problems with the guards that were buffed up last week have been addressed. Some guards that should not have been buffed have been fixed. In addition, due to the level of the new guards, they all gained the ability to innately see-invisible. The level of those guards has been reduced so that they no longer automatically get this ability, making it a bit easier to sneak by them.<br>
    - Many quests have been updated and/or fixed, both in terms of ease of completion and reward.<br>
    <br>
    *Item Updates*<br>
    <br>
    - Corrected a typo that had the Canyoneer's Pike marked as NO RENT, causing it to disappear on logout.<br>
    - Corrected the model for the Axe of the Iron Back. It was showing as a 2H sword when equipped.<br>
    - The Halcyon Broadsword was mistakenly marked as an artifact. This has been corrected.<br>
    - Corrected item icons for various pieces of Burynai Hide Armor. It was displaying improperly in the inventory slots.<br>
    - The Skull Mask of Innervation has been changed so that it must be worn to activate its effect.<br>
    - Corrected a problem with the Scourgetail Whip whereby the damage and delay figures were transposed yielding a 30 damage, 5 delay weapon.&nbsp;<br>
    - The "Illusion: Iksar&quot; spell scroll is now droppable/tradeable.<br>
    - The Goblin Eye Poker now looks like a dagger instead of a small sack.<br>
    - The Cone of Mystics, which incidentally also looked like a small sack, now looks as intended.<br>
    - Corrected a typo that had the Goblin Skull Crusher's effect set to the "Lull" spell, which is not appropriate for a melee weapon. The "Lull" effect has been replaced with an appropriate effect.<br>
    - The Pouch of Mistletoe Powder will now impart its effect on the targeted character.<br>
    - Mosquito Wings are available in game once again.<br>
    - Many items had incorrect usage restrictions, and have been repaired.<br>
    <br>
    As always, we strive to avoid making negative changes to items that already exist in game. However, there are cases where a particularly unbalancing error has been made, such as with the Scourgetail Whip mentioned above, where the item in question must be fixed in interest of maintaining game balance.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    We will continue to repair problems, add content, and enhance gameplay in both Kunark and EQ proper. We appreciate everyone's support.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you,<br>
