          Well &quot;bugs&quot; would have fit better given my attempt at
          aliteration, but &quot;bugs&quot; probably isn't a correct term given
          most of the contents.
          <p>Yesterday, someone here at the office sent me a copy of a complete
          list of bard issues from the &quot;Concert Hall&quot;, which I believe
          is the busiest class-specifc bard board on the net. I answered the
          email, but thought that I should post my response here. Please forgive
          the nametags as it's not my usual format.
          <p>One thing I would like to note is that this same list (or one of
          the same format) came to the boards here around the beginning of June.
          At that time I addressed every issue, much as I am doing here. I'm a
          little dismayed to see some of the same issues that were labled
          &quot;Working as intended&quot; still on the list today. I'll have to
          ask the bards, if you want meaningful communication, we're going to
          have to agree to disagree on some of these issues and try to move
          forward on things that we can agree on.
          <p>Thanks,
          <p>-Gordon

          <p>Complete List of Bard Bugs/Not a Whine 00.09.26<br>
          The following document has been reviewed on the Concert Hall site and<br>
          includes feedback from numerous bards from many servers:<br>
          <br>
          BROKEN GRAPHIC ISSUES<br>
          <br>
          * Drums look like flutes when equipped. Strumming a flute looks quite
          silly<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – We may at some point look into creating another
          drum model, but it’s not a high priority at the moment as it’s not
          a functional issue.</b><br>
          <br>
          * Brahm’s Horn has no graphics when equipped.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – Fixed in the database. Next item patch.<br>
          </b><br>
          * Raw bamboo (wind instrument) has no wind animation – should be
          same as a flute.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – I don’t believe that raw bamboo qualifies as
          a wind instrument. We’ll see for certain in the next patch. The
          original implementation was meant to be a component for instrument
          construction.<br>
          </b><br>
          * Female bards cannot dance.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – Shared animations don’t translate from the
          parent character due to side of the model. We’ll see about
          addressing this at some point in the future, but as with the drum
          issue, it’s not a high priority.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* [Non bug, but annoying] Bard 'waddles' when running. Why this
          animation was changed from the glide effect is odd since the bard was
          strumming a flute.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Working as intended. This is the animation that
          is used, and though I understand that there are some that do not like
          the animation, it wouldn’t be prudent to revisit it when time can be
          spent on more fruitful pursuits. There were people complaining about
          the “glide” at one point which is why a “running while
          playing” animation was put in.</b>
          <p><b><br>
          </b>BROKEN ITEM ISSUES<br>
          <br>
          * Mask of Songbird – Plane of Sky item weighs 5.0. Obvious typo. ALL
          other POS masks for all other classes weigh 0.5 or less. Not sure if
          this has been fixed yet.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – Just had this fixed in the database.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Small Brass Trumpet - item listed in patch message over a year
          ago. No one has ever found item –ever.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- It's not in game. There are no specific plans
          for it in game. Our apologies for listing it previously.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Practice Lute - item listed in patch message over a year ago. No
          one has ever found item – ever.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- It's not in game. There are no specific plans
          for it in game. Our apologies for listing it previously.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Both Lizardman Scout Fife or Froglok Escort Fife are unusable as
          instruments.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- They aren't meant to be usable as instruments.<br>
          </b></p>
          <p>BROKEN SONG ISSUES<br>
          <br>
          * Lyssa's Veracious Concord (24) - If player has spell effect to see
          ultravision prior to this song, the player is reduced to human
          night-blindness when song wears off. This happens even if the player
          has natural infravision/ultravision. Not sure if this was fixed.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Fixed in next client.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Psalm of Warmth (25) – Song is AC, CR, Damage Shield and
          Infravision. If player has spell effect to see infravision prior to
          the song, the player is reduced to human night-blindness when song
          wears off.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Fixed in next client.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Solon’s Song of the Sirens (27) – Charm song that cannot be
          refreshed before breaking on non-PvP servers, but is refreshable prior
          to breaking on PvP servers. Should be refreshable on both.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Can't reproduce any differences between the
          servers. In any case, the charm spell is not designed to be
          refreshable, in any form. It is currently working as intended.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Crission’s Pixie Strike (28) – Mez song that just doesn’t
          work. Unless a highly resistable, 0.01 nanosecond mez is what was
          intended. Tons of posts at Concert Hall site with statistics on how
          poor this song works. VI promised to look into song prior to and then
          after Kunark, but no answers yet.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Working as intended at the moment. We've agreed
          to reevalute it in the future, but I’m not prepared to establish a
          timeline for that evaluation at this time due to some other, more
          widespread, issues that are being worked on currently.<br>
          </b><i><br>
          Actually Ester promised that this and Song of Twilight were next on
          her plate 2 patches ago. I guess her being re-assigned changes all
          this.<br>
          <br>
          </i>* Psalms of Vitality (29) - Song was updated to do cure on pulse,
          but does not seem to do so reliably. Many bards have seen message
          “Your affliction has been cured by a magical enchantment” but the
          disease/poison icon still present OR continue to lose hit points.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Todd tested this. The song works fine, but the
          success message is being sent no matter what. The message is what's
          broken, not the song.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Psalms of Cooling (33) – Same issues as level 25 song, except
          due to ultravision.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Fixed in next client.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Psalms of Purity (37) – Same issues as level 29 song.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Fixed in next client.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Solon’s Bewitching Bravura (39) – Charm song that cannot be
          refreshed before breaking on non-PvP servers, but is refreshable on
          PvP servers. Song also lowers magic resistance, which is intented to
          make it easier to recharm the mob, but on non-PvP servers – a
          useless debuf.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Can't reproduce any differences between the
          servers. In any case, the charm spell is not designed to be
          refreshable, in any form. It is currently working as intended.<br>
          <br>
          </b>*Syvelian’s Anti-Magic Aura (40) – Song appears to dispel
          magic, but the bard receives no feedback message when used on mobs
          (e.g. “MobX looks dispelled”).<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Javier has fixed this in the database. Next
          spell update.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Jonthan’s Provocation (45) – Song is a mix of Str+AC+ damage
          absorption shield. If shield is used up, all other effects fail.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- All spells work this way. If one component of a
          spell is used up, overwritten, resisted, or dispelled, all other
          components suffer the same fate.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Song of Highsun (56) – Supposed to stun, cancel magic, then
          self shadow step. Problem is, if target resists the song you don’t
          get to shadow step. This should happen regardless of target resisting
          the song.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- All spells work this way. If one component of a
          spell is used up, overwritten, resisted, or dispelled, all other
          components suffer the same fate.<br>
          </b></p>
          <p>BAD TUNES (MOST OVER LEVEL 50)<br>
          <br>
          * Kellin's Lucid Lullaby (15) – Song is essentially unusable due to
          80% resist rates. Song also overrides higher-level enchanter mez
          spells. Bards have done extensive testing of this song at all levels,
          charisma, and mob levels and have found that: higher charisma
          increases resists and higher level increases resists. GZ has stated
          song should have 35% resist rate, but actual numbers are twice this
          (from what bards believe, bad coding in secondary resist). VI has
          stated that song was tested and is working as intended, but offers no
          proof of testing or what was actually tested. Without this song, the
          only form of bard “crowd control” is charming or single target
          mezzing (not that it works either). The amount of evidence of this
          song not working is enormous and can all be found at Concert Hall
          site.&nbsp;<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- The resist rates cited are not correct for most
          encounters. Though anecdotes on the next report resist rates in excess
          of 80% even with a level 60 bard versus a level 1 snake, we’ve found
          that to be incorrect. The spell has use at the lower levels, but as
          designed, it becomes far less useful for higher level encounters.
          Works as intended.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Selo’s Constant Chain (23) One of two songs unintentionally
          nerfed when 54 song was changed. Song used to stop mobs in their
          tracks at 50% health, since patch does not stop mob until down to 20%.
          Song also overrides higher level snares of other classes. UPDATE: VI
          has decided that song was too powerful after 18 months as-is with no
          documented complaints. Consensus on bard bulletin boards is that VI
          does not want to spend time to fix song and<br>
          has instead opted for a cop-out nerf. Song has random 0-9 second
          duration, 3 second casting time, and higher resists than snare/root.
          If song is left as-is, bards want a full 9 second chain to make up for
          reduced strength &amp; high resists, now it is just weak AND
          unpredictable.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Works as intended. The previous operation of the
          spell yielded creatures that would stop cold when fleeing at aroudn
          50% health. Rather than fight like a rooted NPC (which would have been
          fine), the NPCs would do nothing while getting beaten for half of
          their life.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Denon’s Dissension (35) – Intended to be a mana draining
          song. Drains mana at an incredibly slow pace. In PvP, a player with
          breeze or clarity can easily outpace mana drain done by this song. Use
          against mobs of same level an exercise in futility unless bard has
          about an hour to drain the mob’s mana.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – This spell is working as intended. If we need
          to reevaluate it at some point we can.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Nillipus’ March of the Wee (52) – Song gives ac+agi+absorb
          damage shield. All effects fail when shield is used up. The problem is
          that the shield cancels out from one quarter of one mob hit. More
          effective for bards just to sing level 50 song for ac+agi. Can other
          effects remain up even if shield fails or increase shield to take more
          damage?<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- All spells work this way. If one component of a
          spell is used up, overwritten, resisted, or dispelled, all other
          components suffer the same fate.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Song of Twilight (53) –Upgrade to mez song (28), that mezs and
          reduces magic resistance. If target is struck, the stun is eliminated
          as well as the magic resistance. Can magic resistance debuf stay in
          effect when mez is broken?<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- All spells work this way. If one component of a
          spell is used up, overwritten, resisted, or dispelled, all other
          components suffer the same fate.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Selo’s Assonaint Strane (54) – An AE slow song intended to
          be upgrade to level 20 AE slow song. The problem: Instrument has no
          effect on 54 song, resulting in a 20% slow versus 35% from level 20
          song.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- I'll ask testing to check instrument
          effectiveness.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* McVaxius Rousing Rondo (57) – Haste song intended to be an
          upgrade to level 50 and level 54 songs. The problem: Instrument has no
          effect on 57 song resulting in a 22% haste versus level 50 (30% haste)
          and level 54 (45% haste). Using an instrument should double the
          effectiveness of this song.&nbsp;<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- I'll ask testing to check instrument
          effectiveness.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Jonathan’s Inspiration (58) – Song gives str+ attack speed+
          absorb damage shield. Yet another song where when damage shield is
          used up (1/4 of 1 mob hit), all other effects fail. More effective to
          sing level 10 Anthem de Arms, 42 Berzerker Cresendo, or 50 Verses of
          Victory for almost same stats and not worry about buffs disappearing.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- All spells work this way. If one component of a
          spell is used up, overwritten, resisted, or dispelled, all other
          components suffer the same fate.<br>

          </b>BAD QUEST ISSUES<br>
          <br>
          * Doing Fabian quest costs more than reward. To complete quest you
          must: kill rare level 32 mob in north karana (~8 hour spawn). Take
          troll guts to bard guild in Qeynos, pay 50gp and get lute strings. Go
          back to Fabian in Freeport and receive: a couple silver pieces and
          increase “bard” faction (which does not exist- is a leftover from
          beta). Why not have Fabian give a “Kellin’s practice lute”
          (which has never been found in game) and increase to League of
          Antonica Bards?<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Perhaps we'll reevalutate it someday for risk
          and reward, but it isn't a high priority at the moment.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Winds of Karana. Kill hermit in SK (level 20+ mob) to get a
          level 3-4 song.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Perhaps we'll reevalutate it someday for risk
          and reward, but it isn't a high priority at the moment.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* No one has seen a Burnyai Bunt Cake (Firiona Vie quest from
          Scout Treekill for a bard helm). Can someone confirm that item can be
          found on a live server?<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- This isn't a quest. It's a story. The item isn't
          in game purposely.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Singing Short Sword. Haste effect a proc that is marginally
          better than existing bard haste songs and worse than enchanter haste
          buffs. Proc effect cancels the better enchanter haste spells.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- We're reevaluating several of the epic-quest
          items tomorrow.<br>
          <br>
          </b>*Singing Steel effects are near useless for a bard, regardless of
          level.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- It is the bard's choice whether or not to use
          these effects. If nothing else, it is still high AC armor. The armor
          wasn't designed to be a natural upgrade from the plane armor. It's one
          of the tradeoffs.</b></p>
          <p>Helm(Eye of Zomm)- I dont really see any use for this, even as a
          novelty.I agree there needs to be more fun items in the game, but
          please dont make this an item that comes off a level 55 mob.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- It's not something that they are required to
          wear. It's a choice. If they feel that it has no value, they should
          seek out something more to their liking.<br>
          </b><br>
          Brestplate(Invigorate)- A 100 point heal, with a very long cast time.I
          dont know one bard who would use this..You must stop singing to use
          effects.A bard at the level it would take to aquire this would get
          MUCH greater effect for the whole group by just twisting 1 or 2 songs.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Maybe we should reevaluate this one. This is
          supposed to be a good effect. A bard can get nearly this value of
          healing in the casting time of the breastplate just by playing their
          song with the appropriate instrument.<br>
          <br>
          </b>Arms-(invigor) Stamina Buff..bards really dont use stamina...and
          bards have a song that at the level it takes to aquire this has a far
          greater effect for the whole group.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- It's not something that they are required to
          wear. It's a choice. If they feel that it has no value, they should
          seek out something more to their liking.<br>
          <br>
          </b>Gloves-( Enduring breathe) again, this would be useful to someone
          who isnt a bard.There is currently one dungeon in the game that
          requires water breathing.Kedge Keep...I dont know any bards who can
          solo there, if any exists...Therefore, if a bard is down there, he is
          with a group..if he is with a group, he will be singing his enduring
          breathe song most likely...kinda redundant..<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- It's not something that they are required to
          wear. It's a choice. If they feel that it has no value, they should
          seek out something more to their liking. In regards to the complaint
          that the bard will already be singing the water-breathing song, by
          having this item the bard no longer has the need to do that, allowing
          them to twist other, more preferable songs. It is very useful in
          limited circumstances.<br>
          <br>
          </b>Legs-(Summon Food) The casting time on this is way too long,
          specially for something that comes off such a mob.It is more time
          effectiant for a bard to beg a local magician to summon him 20 food 20
          drink in the time it takes a bard to produce 1 food 1 drink.I think it
          should be replaced with cornicopia.This will not be unbalancing if you
          keep it's current casting time.And this wont take away the newbie mage
          mainstay for making money, summoning, because at the level it takes to
          get/use this item, who would sit around summoning food to sell to
          newbies?<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – The spell may very well be inappropriate.
          We’ll put it on the list for discussion.<br>
          </b><br>
          Boots(Summon drink) pretty much same argument as legs..<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] –This one too.<br>
          <br>
          </b>My suggestions..<br>
          <br>
          Helm-Some sort of Charisma buff<br>
          Brestplate-Something like illusion werewolf..it makes roleplay sense,
          as the<br>
          bards in Mistmoore do it.<br>
          Arms-A Dexerity Buff<br>
          Bracers-Keep the same<br>
          Gloves-An agi buff<br>
          Pants-Cornicopia<br>
          Boots-Everfont<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Nearly all of the spells on all of the
          activatable armor (across all classes) has limited usefulness. The
          spells suggested here would all be very useful, leading to balance
          problems with the activatable items of other classes. In the end,
          though I do want to revisit a couple of the items, it is still the
          choice of the bard to wear or not wear this armor. The armor itself is
          not meant to be an upgrade to planar armor, but an alternative.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Stuck songs – bards occasionally get stuck on a song and are
          unable to stop it. Difficult to replicate, but appears to be
          associated with lag. Once stuck, the /stopsong command has no effect.
          The only know cure is to spam the hotkey/gem repeatedly (a few dozen
          times) or log.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – We’ve never been able to pin this one down.
          If they have a way to do it, the testing department would be very
          happy to talk about it on the QA board.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Start/stop songs – client issue where bards twisting songs
          have the song stop immediately after it was just started. Looks like:
          “Your feet begin to slow down” (bard starts selos) “Your feet
          move faster” then immediately see “Your feet slow down” (and
          left without any speed effect).<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – Haven’t really been able to pin this one down
          either, as above.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Songs breaking rogue sneaking. Two issues: bards able to break
          rogues sneaking even if rogue not in same group and bards singing mana
          song break rouges sneaking even if rogue a moderate distance away.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – I’ve asked Roger to bump this up on his
          plate. It’s been around for a while and we should get it fixed.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Chords of Dissonance (2) – no animation when playing song and
          no mobs in range. Very dangerous with AE damage song.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- This is how these spells work.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Disruptive Discord (10) – no animation when playing song and
          no mobs in range. Very dangerous with AE damage song.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- This is how these spells work.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Selo’s Song of Travel (51) – Lots of discussion on boards to
          either (A) remove invis so speed part won’t break if hit by mob or
          (B) keep invis because bards use this song is an instrument-less invis
          song for corpse retrieval. Best solution would be a (C) make song
          similar to Druid/Shaman spells where speed/lev stays up even if invis
          portion of spell breaks because party member was hit by mob.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Working as intended. We may reevaluate at this
          point but it's not really on the list at the moment.<br>
          </b>
          <p><b><br>
          </b>BARDS STILL MIFFED OVER<br>
          <br>
          * Selo’s no longer breaks root on PvP servers. Since release, if a
          bard had selo’s song up and was rooted by a player/mob, the next
          pulse of speed song would break the root (if song was not up prior to
          root, song would not break it). A recent unannounced patch eliminated
          this ability resulting in many PvP bard’s deaths. Bard’s are
          mostly upset because there are so many legitimate, long-standing
          problems with the class and these are types of things being worked on.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- The fact that it ever broke root was a bug.
          While I understand the desire for us to fix “long standing
          problems” before working on issues of this nature, this turned out
          to be a quick fix that was very easily addressed. We could leave stuff
          like this in while doing all of the other fixes, however we’d then
          have to deal with complaints that “It’s always been like this”
          and “why didn’t we fix it sooner”. It’s a bit of a
          double-edged sword.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Lock picking. Bards get skill at level 40. Skill is capped so
          low that bards can only open doors in Befallen and gate to the Hole.
          Raising skill would be nice to open Kunark doors – why is a level 40
          bard opening doors in newbie dungeon? (check bard count at primetime
          hours, and you’ll be lucky to see more than 12 45+ bards on any
          server).<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Bard lock-picking is supposed to have limited
          usefulness. At the moment there are very few locked doors in mid-level
          dungeons that would be appropriate targets for Bard lock-picking.
          Perhaps at some point it might be appropriate for a newer zone.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Disarm Traps. Ok, no traps to disarm. Rogues got new skills
          (backstab &amp; evade) to make up for this, bards were promised it
          would be looked into as well, but never got anything.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Creation of bard songs and other enhancements
          that have been made took into account that this skill is not useful in
          its current form.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Skill caps on singing, percussion, string, brass, and wind still
          at 200 for bards over level 50. Other casting classes have casting
          skills up to 250.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – Other casting classes don’t go up to 250, but
          I’m not opposed to increasing the instrument caps to reduce
          failures. We’ll put it in the next patch.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Dodge/Parry. Bards get skills at 53 and 58 respectively. Way too
          high for most players to ever see them and excessively high compared
          to other classes that get these skills in 20s and 30s. Both parry
          &amp; riposte capped at 70. Below is summary of all melee/hybrid
          combat skills to put this into perspective:<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – I understand the point, but the skills were not
          meant to be a large balance component to the class, but rather a
          reward for making it that high in level. Decreasing the level of
          acquisition or increasing the caps wouldn’t be appropriate.<br>
          </b></p>
          <p>OTHER SUGGESTIONS/OBSERVATIONS<br>
          <br>
          * Still missing 49 song- thanks for asking for our input Abashi. Lots
          of good suggestions out there.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- No 49th level song is planned at this time.</b>
          <p>* Could musical instruments (when viewed) contain information on
          which skill they are for? Percussion/String/Wind/Brass. Not always
          obvious on wind/brass instruments. Also, would be fantastic to see
          something like “+10% to some brass” or “+5% to combat wind”.
          Often, only very high level bards can baseline instrument improvements
          today (hard to see 5% improvement if song only adds 5 strength).<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] – I suppose we can compromise here. We’ll have
          the skill used displayed on the item tag following the next
          client-patch, but won’t list the direct modifiers.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Denon’s Desperate Dirge (43) – 800 mana for AE 275 damage.
          Breeze/Clarity/Mana song have no effect on bards mana regen (takes 30+
          minutes to recharge when OOM), making this song the absolute worst in
          terms of damage/downtime. With 39 charm song now using mana, bards
          never use this song. Abashi started a thread asking for input and
          consensus was: allow song to be memmed, sung immediately (at no mana
          cost), and then have a 15-minute effect on player where song could not
          be sung again. Let’s face it, 800 mana is 80-90% of a bards mana and
          doesn’t leave much for charming. 275 damage on a level 43 mob is
          less than one half of one bub of hp. * Mana on 39 charm song. Biggest
          problem is that after a rez, a bard has no mana, and often takes
          almost an hour to get back to FM. The ability for a bard to charm
          should be dependent on this.<br>
          <b>[Wrinn, Gordon] -- This is as designed. Bards are not supposed to
          get any benefit from +mana songs. Using one of their two mana-using
          songs is supposed to have a large cost. It is the drawback for having
          powerful songs.<br>
          <br>
          </b>* Instrument pieces. Lots of bardic instrument pieces at vendors
          (including one in Kunark), but no way to put them together. Perhaps
          add to tinkering or put in bard only instrument skill (like
          research).&nbsp;<br>
