Distance Between Them. Caution: The Mass of This Product Contains the Energy
Equivalent of 85 Million Tons of TNT per Net Ounce of Weight. Handle with
Extreme Care: This Product Contains Minute Electrically Charged Particles Moving
at Velocities in Excess of Five Hundred Million Miles per Hour. Consumer Notice:
Because of the ‘Uncertainty Principle,’ It Is Impossible for the Consumer to
Find Out at the Same Time Both Precisely Where This Product Is and How Fast It
Is Moving. Advisory: There is an Extremely Small but Nonzero Chance That,
Through a Process Known as &quot;Tunneling,&quot; This Product May Spontaneously
Disappear from Its Present Location and Reappear at Any Random Place in the
Universe, Including Your Neighbors Domicile. The Manufacturer Will Not Be
Responsible for Any Damages or Inconvenience That May Result. Read This Before
Opening Package: According to Certain Suggested Versions of a Grand Unified
Theory, the Primary Particles Constituting This Product May Decay to Nothingness
Within the Next Four Hundred Million Years. This is a 100% Matter product: In
the Unlikely Event That This Merchandise Should Contact Antimatter in Any Form,
a Catastrophic Explosion Will Result. Public Notice as Required by Law: Any Use
of This Product, in Any Manner Whatsoever, Will Increase the Amount of Disorder
in the Universe. Say No to Drugs. Although No Liability Is Implied Herein, the
Consumer Is Warned That This Process Will Ultimately Lead to the Heat Death of
the Universe. The frogurt is also cursed. Note: The Most Fundamental Particles
in This Product Are Held Together by a 'Gluing' Force About Which Little Is
Currently Known and Whose Adhesive Power Can Therefore Not Be Permanently
Guaranteed. Attention: Despite Any Other Listing of Product Contents Found
Hereon, the Consumer Is Advised That, in Actuality, This Product Consists Of
99.9999999999% Empty Space. New Grand Unified Theory Disclaimer: The
Manufacturer May Technically Be Entitled to Claim That This Product Is Ten-
Dimensional. However, the Consumer Is Reminded That This Confers No Legal Rights

New Dimensions Are 'Rolled Up' into Such a Small 'Area' That They Cannot Be
Detected. If you have read this from the beginning, then you must be very patient.

Directly Observing This Product, It May Cease to Exist or Will Exist Only in a
Vague and Undetermined State. Component equivalency notice: The Subatomic

Same in Every Measurable Respect as Those Used in the Products of Other
Manufacturers, and No Claim to the Contrary May Legitimately Be Expressed or
Implied. Health Warning: Care Should Be Taken When Lifting This Product, Since
Its Mass, and Thus Its Weight, Is Dependent on Its Velocity Relative to the
User. Important Notice to Purchasers: The Entire Physical Universe, Including
This Product, May One Day Collapse Back into an Infinitesimally Small Space.
Should Another Universe Subsequently Re-emerge, the Existence of This Product in
That Universe Cannot be Guaranteed. Disclaimer does not cover misuse, accident,
