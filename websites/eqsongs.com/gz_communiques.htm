          Abashi/Brad/Gordon, I have compiled a list of all bard bugs to date
          for your review and comments. Sorry this is so long, but there are a
          lot of bugs. Would love to see an archmage post addressing topics.
          Fellow bards, please add your comments and keep this focused (no
          whining or class-balance just constructive posts).
          <p>BROKEN SONG ISSUES (5 of level 50+ songs not well thought out)<br>
          * Psalms of Vitality (29) - ArchMage post states &quot;These songs, in
          addition to protecting from poison and disease, also have chances to
          remove a poison or disease effect on you. They are a mixture of a cure
          and a resistance buff in one.&quot; - GZ Archmage answers 2.3.00. No
          bard has ever seen this happen. Action: Look into percentage chance
          &amp; adjust OR tell bards that ArchMage misspoke.<br>
          * Psalms of Purity (37) - ArchMage post states that song has chance to
          cure disease. No bard has ever seen this happen. Action: Look into
          percentage chance &amp; adjust OR tell bards that ArchMage misspoke.<br>
          * Kellin's Lucid Lullaby (15) - Resist rates so high that song is
          unusable. Level 50 bards get 50% resist rates on level 1 mobs. Resist
          rates for many sub 30 bards well over 80%. Resist rates were more
          reasonable prior to patch that added secondary resist check. Also, the
          song affects pets on pvp servers. Also, the song is considered higher
          than enchanter enthrall spell. Action: Look into resist rates on song
          &amp; adjust.<br>
          * Lyssa's Veracious Concord (24) - If player has spell effect to see
          ultravision prior to this song, the player is reduced to human
          night-blindness when it wears off. This happens even if the player has
          natural infravision/ultravision. Action: Look into why song breaks
          other vision. Fix other songs first though.<br>
          * Selo's Constant Chain (23) - Normal duration was 9 seconds prior to
          patch in Feb. Song now often breaks under 2 seconds or less (often
          while we are still 'singing' it). Action: Look into time song should
          last &amp; adjust OR tell bards that song has been nerfed and why.
          This has been broken for 2 months.<br>
          * Angstlich’s Appauling Screech (26) – Fear does not interrupt
          casting.<br>
          * Lyssa’s Solidarity of Vision (34) – Song gets stuck when used on
          moving targets. If monster moves too far, client forgets where it is,
          and you can only see the last known position.<br>
          * Jonthan’s Provocation (45) – Couple problems. No message
          displayed when sung (“Player X looks provoked”), song fizzles 25%
          of the time, does not work on pets, and the damage shield portion of
          the song causes all other effects to fail.<br>
          * Niv’s Melody of Preservation (47) – Spell damage shield causes
          song to end prematurely.<br>
          * Still missing 49 song- thanks for asking for our input. Lots of good
          suggestions out there.<br>
          * Selo’s Song of Travel (51) – Bad combo. Entire song cancels if
          hit by anything (invis portion breaks whole song). Worst of all,
          can’t re-apply speed if continuing to get hit. Better off singing
          level 5 selo song.<br>
          * Largo’s Absonant Binding (51) – Intended as an upgrade to chain
          song (23), but the range is shorter. In pvp, it can be canceled by
          jboots.<br>
          * Nillipus’ March of the Wee (52) – Bad combo. Song ends
          prematurely due to dmg shield portion of song. Intended to help tanks
          with AC+AGI, but often cancels in one round of combat.<br>
          * Song of Twilight (53) – Bad combo. Upgrade to stun song (28), that
          stuns and reduces magic resistance. If target is struck, the stun is
          eliminated as well as the magic resistance.<br>
          * Selo’s Assonant Strain (54) – Wrong gem color &amp; particle
          effect. It is an AE song, but gem is yellow meaning self only. Damage
          particle effects shown, but song is slowing the mob.<br>
          * Brusco’s Bombastic Bellow (55) – Intended to be an upgrade to dd
          bard song to stun and damage target. Instead it HEALS the target and
          stuns. Also, it is resisted far more often than the low level song.
          <p>BROKEN QUEST ISSUES<br>
          * Special Bardic Weapon from Temple of Solusek Ro. Quest for special
          weapon still not present.<br>
          * Fabian (quest from Qeynos) not in game - anywhere. No one has ever
          seen him - ever. Action: verify Fabian can be found / check spawn
          rate.<br>
          * Metala Highfit (quest from SK) not in game. Is this a broken quest
          from Vhalen or just color to the game?
          <p>BROKEN ITEM ISSUES<br>
          * Selo’s Drums of the March &amp; Level 51 speed song. Selo’s drum
          has no impact, but regular drum increases effect.<br>
          * Mask of Songbird - POS item weighs 5.0. Obvious typo. All other POS
          mask items for other classes weigh 0.5 or less. Action: fix typo.<br>
          * Kunark armor- Bards are defined as a plate class, but AC on new
          armor appears to be chain level (remember bard is like a cleric, lots
          of AC, no defensive skills). Also, effects to summon food/water very
          lame compared to what other classes get (and the fact bards have
          forage skill). Action: please look into values and adjust to levels
          comparable to paladins &amp; sks not rangers/shaman/rouges. Mistake
          similar to when bards got Imbrued.<br>
          * Small Brass Trumpet - item listed in patch message. No one has ever
          found item -ever. Action: verify item can be found on live server.<br>
          * Practice Lute - item listed in patch message. No one has ever found
          item - ever. Action: verify item can be found on live server.<br>
          * Horns inconsistent – some horns are brass and others are wind even
          though graphics are the same.
          <p>BROKEN ANIMATION ISSUES<br>
          * Bard bangs on flute when should be playing a drum. Action: add
          correct animation - low priority.<br>
          * Female bards cannot dance.<br>
          * Bard 'waddles' when running. Why this animation was changed from the
          glide effect is odd in light of the fact that instrument animation had
          bard banging on a flute when running - low priority.
          <p>OTHER SUGGESTIONS/OBSERVATIONS<br>
          * Item Switching: No other class switches items as much as bards -
          period. Bards are constantly switching between instruments because of
          song requirements or increased effects. Why should the interface be
          such a pain or cause carpal tunnel? A big problem is the pixel gaps
          between the hotkeys. Fix this with: toggle switch to prevent dropping
          items (please no confirmation - last thing we want to do is answer a
          yes/no question in middle of a fight) a simple &quot;/dropitem
          off&quot; or &quot;/dropitem on&quot; would be fantastic OR eliminate
          gaps between hotkeys OR add new inventory spots to place instruments
          with ability to switch using a key instead of mouse movements (like
          range weapon). Caster classes don't need to switch between 4 different
          items (+weapons) to cast spells. Ok, make bards switch, but make it
          easier. Almost impossible to switch with any kind of lag, and dropping
          valuable items getting old.<br>
          * Any possiblility for a /twistsong ####, where # is the gem #? Would
          make twisting considerably easier than hitting keys twice every 3
          seconds.<br>
          * Sing emote. Nice for roleplaying.<br>
          * Magical bard musical instruments give no indication of their effect
          on the player (+5% String, +20% Percussion, +10% to Brass, etc). It
          would be nice to either see this info with a right click or when using
          the identification song.<br>
          * Oversight: Bards are now using mana on 2 songs, but do not get
          benefits of clarity or mana song. Why are bards the ONLY casting class
          that do not get mana regeneration benefits? This has become more
          problematic since the Desperate Dirge song takes nearly all the
          bard’s mana when sung. UPDATE: Abashi started tread asking for input
          on Dirge song. Popular opinion seems to be no mana, immediately
          available after mem, and after sung, have a 15 min affect preventing
          resinging.
          <p>CONCULSION<br>
          I will continue to monitor this thread and compile the issues and
          repost the thread from time to time.

          Ok, I've forwarded this to the tuning and live teams and I hope to get
          back to address everything in a day or two. There are a couple of
          issues that I'd like to pull out and comment on now though:
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;* Angstlich’s Appauling Screech (26) – Fear does
          not interrupt casting.
          <p>Fear (no matter who its cast by) has never interrupted NPCs who are
          casting spells.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;* Still missing 49 song- thanks for asking for our
          input. Lots of good suggestions out there.
          <p>This probably shouldn't be included in a list of &quot;bugs&quot;.
          One day we might put one in, but we don't have anything planned for
          this slot at present.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;* Item Switching: No other class switches items as much
          as bards - period. Bards are constantly switching between instruments
          because of song requirements or increased effects. Why should the
          interface be such a pain or cause carpal tunnel?
          <p>We've spoken about several options including a drop confirmation,
          and a /command that would make you swap out your items in specific
          inventory slots. I'm not sure when, or if we will something
          implemented here, but it's on our whishlist.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;* Any possiblility for a /twistsong ####, where # is
          the gem #? Would make twisting considerably easier than hitting keys
          twice every 3 seconds.
          <p>Probably not. We'd really like to see bards actively played, rather
          than passivly sitting there after typing one command. The more
          dexterous the person behind the keyboard is the more benefit that a
          bard can impart to the party. A person who can compose a song of 3
          different melodies and change instruments at the same time is a
          formidable bard indeed <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif" width="15" height="15">
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;* Sing emote. Nice for roleplaying.
          <p>Possible, but it would be low priority.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;* Magical bard musical instruments give no indication
          of their effect on the player (+5% String, +20% Percussion, +10% to
          Brass, etc). It would be nice to either see this info with a right
          click or when using the identification song.
          <p>The bonus varies on a per song/per instrument basis. I'd doubt that
          we could come up with a concise representation, and I'm also not sure
          that we'd want to. There are other held items in the game that
          increase the effectiveness of spells and do not specify by how much in
          their description.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Oversight: Bards are now using mana on 2 songs, but do
          not get benefits of clarity or mana song. Why are bards the ONLY
          casting class that do not get mana regeneration benefits?
          <p>Not an oversight at all. We needed a method to place hard limits on
          how well, how often, and how long a specific song could be sung. We
          decided that we didn't want anything to adjust that limit. We have
          offered to switch DDD to a resing timer (same as a recast timer), but
          the charm song will remain on mana.

          In working with the people doing the strategy guide for Kunark we
          decided to provide them with general information as to what the stats
          do.
          <p>I'm going to post them here.
          <p>This is a change in the sense that we were not going to discuss
          them or release more info. We changed our minds.
          <p>That said, we're not posting any formulas, and it's absolutely true
          that some stats have considerably more direct impact on gameplay than
          others.
          <p>We're posting this for clarification, and because previous
          explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not,
          however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect
          game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking.
          Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not
          going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after
          the game's been out for more than a year.
          <p>Anyway, here you go:
          <p>DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will
          proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows
          <p>STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and
          average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills
          <p>STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold
          your breath
          <p>INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills;
          affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow
          knights
          <p>WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also
          rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your
          wisdom is higher than INT.
          <p>CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants,
          and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain
          bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular)
          <p>AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how
          difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when
          you are hit

          Hello all,
          <p>I took the original post with all the questions about bards and
          delivered them directy to Geoffrey Zatkin, the Arch-Mage of Norrath.
          He was kind enough to reply with a very well thought-out response,
          which is below in it's entirety.
          <p>-Gordon
          <p>-----SNIP-----<br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;I've noticed that since retail release the Bard seems to
          be often forgotten when it comes to testing out patches. Things like
          the accidental Selo's nerf (caused by the mem hacking), the Consonant
          Chain debacle (Sow'ed creatures could not be chained), and the most
          recent levitate bug are very obvious to someone who plays a bard. All
          of these unintended nerfs could have been avoided with less then 5
          mins of play testing these changes on a bard. So the question here is
          beyond compiling the code what kind of play testing of changes to the
          magic system takes place?
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          We have a solid internal testing department. The problem is, due to
          the sheer scale of EQ, changes can slip through the cracks. We try to
          fix the ones we miss as soon as we find/hear about them – but in a
          dynamic world, strange things can happen.
          <p>You should see some of the bugs we catch that never make it live
          – or even to test. <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><br>
          **************
          <p><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;Kelin's Lucid Lullaby, I recently tested this song out vs.
          a level one human warrior. My Bard was level 37 at the time, using the
          Lute of the Gypsy Princess and I have charisma of 141. Every round I
          got the 'so and so head nods' message and every nearly every round the
          test subject was able to attack me (about 1 in 10 rounds he would
          not).
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          As most high level enchanters from Beta+ can tell you, there are two
          saving throws that happen with an “Enthrall” style effect (such as
          Kelin’s Lucid Lullaby) hits a creature. The first saving throw is
          against the target’s Magic Resistance. The second saving throw only
          happens with high level monsters – they get a secondary save based
          on their level. The reason for this is that the Enthrall effect is
          very, very powerful – it allows a single player to remove a creature
          from combat. This means that a party that could handle two “X”
          level mobs might be able to take three, or even four of them on if
          there is somebody around with the Enthrall effect.
          <p>Because of this (read game balance) higher level monsters have a
          harder time being enthralled. At lower levels, a single player can
          take out a single opponent of equal level. By mid levels this is much
          harder, and by high levels it is virtually impossible. Allowing a
          single player to remove one or more creatures from combat at high
          levels is sick level powerful – to the point that we designed an
          entire classes specialty around doing it.
          <p>The second saving throw does not send a message the environment –
          and that is something that is on our list of issues to address. There
          are, however, no bugs with the Song.<br>
          **************
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Alenia's Disenchanting Melody, It does now work (9
          months after release), but it strips good as well as bad spells from
          the party, making the song worse then useless. Is this the intended
          effect?
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          Alenia’s Disenchanting Melody works as it was intended to – it
          follows the design that we had for it from the beginning. It is
          particularly useful? Depends if your buddy is dying from a nasty DoT.
          People use Egg Shaped Pumice on themselves all the time on the PvP
          servers. Is the Disenchanting Melody as generally useful as Cancel
          Magic? Not really.<br>
          **************
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Angstlich's Appalling Screech, When used against very
          large creatures (Giants, Mammoths, Elephants, etc..) You have to be
          standing directly under or in some cases IN the NPC Avatar for the
          song to take effect. Otherwise the creature will glow, but no message
          or effect will be seen.
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          Heh. This is due to how the models are built – each has a
          “center” point, which is what calculates where our servers think
          the monster actually is. Really big creatures have center points
          farther away from you – hidden deep within their polygonal body
          mass. I will bump the radius of the Screech up a bit on the next spell
          patch and we can see if it works a bit better. Part of the problem is
          that when I play my Bard, I know exactly how these things work – and
          exactly where to stand. Sometimes knowing a bit too much about
          something works against you.<br>
          **************
          <p><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;Solon's Song of the Sirens, Often times when using this in
          a group situation the newly charmed pet will agro on a party member.
          This could cause a nasty way to get around the PvP switch as the pet
          is immune to PC attack. The pet needs to ignore any player characters
          or pets on its hate list when charmed. Also sometimes player pets
          (party &amp; non-party member pets) will attack the Bard charming a
          NPC if the pet had been attacking the NPC.
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          I’ve had the pet agro on party members too – but it is usually
          because one of my party members did something to the pet that it
          didn’t like just after I charmed it – whacking it, for example. I
          usually have my pet commands hotkeyed, and retarget to something I
          want my new pet to be attacking as soon as I charm it.
          <p>Charm can be dangerous because once you take control of a monster,
          all of its actions reflect on you. If you charm a monster that is
          fighting your friend’s pet, and the pet hits the monster after you
          charm it, your charmed monster will attack back. When that little
          fight gets broken up, there is a possibility that your friend’s pet
          will come after you – you were, after all, the controller of the
          thing it was just fighting. Charming around pets can be done – you
          just need to be a little more careful.<br>
          **************
          <p><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;Crission's Pixie Chase, This song seems to suffer from the
          same problem that Lullaby does, you get the message that the song has
          taken effect, but the target completely ignores the fact that it
          should be mesmerized (similarto the problem with Lucid Lullaby).
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          See above.<br>
          **************
          <p><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;Fufil's Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The
          percussion aspect of these songs is broken. Using a drum produces no
          additional effect (damage or resistance debuff).
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          Hmm – don’t use that one much. I’ll check. If so, we’ll get it
          fixed right up.<br>
          **************
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Psalm of Cooling, The damage shield portion of this
          song does not seem to stack as logic would lead me to<br>
          believe. I can understand that it would weaken fire based damage
          shields, but why would it weaken thistle based damage shields? I have
          not had a chance to see if it stacks with the necro damage shield
          (which I believe is cold based).
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          The Psalm’s Damage Shield will stack with the Druid and Ranger
          personal Damage Shields – but they will not stack with other damage
          shields – in the same way that no other Damage Shield stacks with
          another. You can not, for example, stack Shield of Spikes and Shield
          of Fire.<br>
          **************
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Denon's Dissension, The instrument portion of this song
          seems to be broken. In tests I have run using a horn made no
          difference in mana drain in PvP combat.
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          This was a very tough song to balance. It takes away mana from other
          casters – the virtual lifeblood of 7 of EverQuest’s 14 classes.
          The amount taken away is nice, but not great. Using a Horn increases
          the amount of mana drained. Again, nice, but not great.<br>
          **************
          <p><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;McVaxius Berserker Crescendo, I do not have this song yet,
          but other bards have informed me using a horn only increases the
          song's Strength effect, leaving the attack speed unchanged.
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          The way our song system works, if an instrument effects a song, it
          effects the entire song. Without specifically hardcoding it, I
          couldn’t actually make the Crescendo only effect the AC and STR but
          not the Attack Speed. As I didn’t hardcode it, the Horn should
          increase the attack speed along with the Strength and AC.
          <p>Speaking of which, unless my memory serves me wrong (which it
          could), you *must* use a Horn to use this song.
          <p>As a completely side note, I saw on a certain website that this
          song increases attack speed by 15 percent. It actually does
          considerably more then that. I stand by an earlier comment that I
          still haven’t seen an exceptional spell analysis program yet.<br>
          **************
          <p><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;Verses of Victory, Many of the higher level bards I have
          spoken with are very upset by the recent downgrading of the attack
          speed component, is there any chance this can be restored to previous
          levels?
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          Nothing has changed on Verses of Victory since I put the song in.
          Somebody is pulling your leg.<br>
          **************
          <p><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;A while back GZ mentioned the meming time for bard songs
          would be decreased, but it still takes forever to mem songs (due to
          the lack of a mediate skill). Can this be looked into?
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          It is already on our list of things to add in.<br>
          **************
          <p><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;Can a switch be set up (similar to the Fast Destroy
          option) to give players the choice of 1-Always dropping<br>
          items, 2-Confirm to drop, 3-No dropping of items. Bards I know have
          lost everything from Bladed Thulian Claws to Mistmoore Battledrums due
          to the &quot;cracks&quot; between hotkeys and swapping
          instruments/weapons.
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          Solid suggestion. See what I can do. No promises, but…<br>
          **************
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Every time an answer is given on when the missing bard
          songs will be added the answer is very soon. Any chance of a better
          eta?
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          We were initially gong to save them all for the expansion pack. I
          don’t know if I can wait that long to get at least one of them in (I
          really want to see how people use it), so maybe a bit earlier.<br>
          **************
          <p><br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;DoT change a while back lowered the damage of our DoT
          songs but didn't increase the duration, any chance that this could be
          balanced in some way?
          <p>***GZ SAYS***<br>
          Bards are affected by the Kiting changes just like everybody else.
          Bard’s kiting creatures will get the disadvantage – in all other
          cases, the songs should work just as before. Minimal combat movement
          will not lower the damage on a DoT or Bard Song.

    Magi Answers</a> page on the official EverQuest site:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Q: How do spell fizzles (and missed notes on songs) work?&nbsp;</b><br>
    A: When you cast a spell, we call a fizzle check. There is always a 5% chance of succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a 5% chance of failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is). What modifies a fizzle check are (a) your appropriate skill (Abjuration, Evocation, Brass, Wind, etc.) (b) your primary statistic (Intelligence for Magi, Wisdom for Priests, Dexterity and Charisma for Bards) (c) the difficulty of the spell and (d) the level of the spell.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    When you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has a 20% chance of fizzling. This assumes that (a) your appropriate skill (Evocation, for example) is at its maximum value (b) that you have a minimum of 75 in your appropriate statistic (Intelligence, etc.) and (c) that we did not set the difficulty of the spell to less then average (some spells we assign a lower difficulty, making them easier to cast - to date, we have not made any spells with higher difficulty).&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    If your appropriate statistic is greater then 75 (Intelligence, Wisdom, etc.), we reduce your fizzle percent by 1% for every X points of your statistic above 75.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the spell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (Wizard gets her 4th rank spells at level 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that she had a 60 Alteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in Alteration (the appropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% chance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For every skill point that our Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of fizzling goes down by 1%, to a minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling. Thus, three levels (15 skill points) after our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, she will be able to max out her Alteration and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    A high intelligence would help her to max out her ability to cast Bind Affinity without fizzling earlier.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

          Hi GZ, I was just pondering how the bard teleport song could be very
          interesting but yet it is not. I suggest trying this on the test
          server perhaps and seeing how people like it.
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          If self is targeted: When song is played ONLY the bard will be
          teleported.
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          If nothing targeted, or non-group PC targeted: Entire group is
          teleported
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          If NPC targeted: NPC is randomly teleported (This gives an offensive
          shade to this song, make it so it does not effect 'large' creatures
          such as giants, the dragons, and such. Also make sure it does not
          target the big boats or the little boats)
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't do npc's - they
          get stuck enough as it is.&nbsp; Besides, that would be really easy to
          exploit - the monster would never, ever hit you again.&nbsp; Just keep
          porting it while the Wizard blasted it to bits.</font>&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          If a grouped PC is targeted: Will teleport the PC, the PC MUST be in
          your group, if they are not then the entire group is teleported as if
          there was no target.

          Just to see if I could get a response I sent a message to the
          Arch-Mage of Norrath. If I had really thought I would get a response I
          probably would have given the questions more thought. Below, follows
          my questions and responses.<br>
          <br>
          1. Is Lullaby bugged or has it had its effectiveness reduced? I cant
          seem to keep low, low greens asleep. I get the head nods message and
          they continue to attack. From my experience and the posts of other
          Bards seems like this<br>
          song has become almost useless. Is this just something we will have to
          live with?<br>
          <br>
          RESPONSE - Nothing has changed - though it does lose some of its
          effectiveness against higher level creatures.<br>
          <br>
          2. Disenchanting Melody was implemented with the last patch. However,
          it removes all buffs (positive and negative) from the top down. This
          makes this song very unpopular as it effects the entire group. Was
          this an intentional design? If so would it be possible to make it a
          targeted song so as not to remove every buff on the whole team to
          assist one individual?<br>
          <br>
          RESPONSE - This is the design of the song. It is made for when you
          really need bad magic stuff removed, and are not really picky about
          how it goes away.<br>
          <br>
          Well guys there you have it, according to GZ nothing has changed with
          Lullaby, (Recon he even has a clue as to how bad this song gets
          resisted.)<br>
          and Disenchanting Melody appears to be just the way they want it. (For
          the life of me, I wish I could see why the could not have made this a
          targeted song)<br>
          <br>
          Just thought I would share this info with you.<br>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Q: Why is there no Icon
      for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra’s Chorus of Clarity)?</strong></font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: There are different types
      of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an icon on your character because the
      song has a duration - usually 5 to 15 seconds. Each time the Bard sings
      the song she renews the duration - this means that a Bard who continues to
      sing the song can potentially keep the song effect going indefinitely.<br>
      Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the
      Bard sings it, but will not get another “dose” until she sings it
      again. Cassindra’s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these
      songs - it does not have an actual duration, so you don’t get an icon on
      your screen.</font>

The songs will be in the game - you will NOT need to buy the expansion to get them.

Most should be available before the expansion ships.

      <!--mstheme--></font><pre>&gt; Greetings Arch Mage,
&gt; I have a question regarding the Bard song Jaxan's Jig o' Vigor.
&gt; I know many Bards and non-Bards the say this song increases mana
&gt; regeneration.&nbsp; I know just as many Bards that say it does not.&nbsp; A while
back
&gt; a poster named J.M. Capozzi posted to the EQBards OneList mailing list
that
&gt; he had spoken to someone at Verant that told him it did not increase mana
&gt; regeneration.&nbsp; If you could lay this Urban Myth to rest one way or another
&gt; the Bard community would be very grateful.
&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urban Myth - Jig only gives fatigue back.

      Taken From Casters Realm:<br>
      <br>
      Bards have two stages to the success of their songs.<br>
      Firstly they have to successfully play the song. This is based on:<br>
      <br>
      Their skill in the music type (Singing, Wind, etc).<br>
      Their Dexterity.<br>
      Their Charisma.<br>
      Secondly, if they successfully play the song, the songs chance of being
      resisted by the target is based on:<br>
      <br>
      The Level of the Bard.<br>
      The Level of the target.<br>
      The Save Level of the target (Magic Resist, Fire Resist, etc).<br>
      The Bards Charisma for spells such as Sleep, Charm, or Lull.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I actually can have the joy of doing the bard song list for caster realm
      in the near future, but didnt want to compete with the new song list. The
      advantages of being on Casters Realm would be we would have a direct
      pipeline to GZ through Baelish. Which I would think would be a wonderful
      thing.<br>

  <!--mstheme--></font><pre>Well, after 3 tries, I finally got a reply to the list of questions that we
put together to send to GZ.&nbsp; Don't know if all the answers are exactly what
I might have hoped to hear, but its nice to at least get some info.&nbsp; The
questions may not be exactly what we had originally put together, I revised
this each time I sent it in as some things were corrected already with
patches (lack of bard quests) and some new things came up.

Elwyn Heartstring
Level 50 Bard
Erollisi Marr

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GZ: I have gotten really behind on my e-mail - just because of the volume
that I get.&nbsp; I try to answer every one I get, but for the past 2 months this
just hasn't been possible.


Elwyn: Where, oh where are our missings songs?!&nbsp; Several of our songs
(levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don't seem to be in the game.&nbsp; We would like to know
when we can expect these to be implemented.&nbsp; If they are indeed in the game
already(perhaps discovered via quests) please at least let us know that they
exist.&nbsp; We don't need to know how/where to get them, or even what they are,
but we don't want to waste our time questing for something that isn't there.
We've been without these songs (whatever they are) since day one of release,
and its become a point of serious aggrivation for us.

GZ: This missing songs are being saved for the expansion pack.&nbsp; We might
break down and put some of them in sooner, but I really wanted to be able to
add new abilities to Bards as the game contintued.


Elwyn: The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to
have no effect whatsoever.&nbsp; This has been tested repeatedly by many, many
bards.&nbsp; It does not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it
should) nor does it protect in any way from harmful effects.&nbsp; Can you please
confirm whether this song is broken or not?&nbsp; When can we expect a fix?

GZ: I will check this one out.&nbsp; It *should* cast cancel magic on your entire
group - and did at one point of beta.&nbsp; It is high on my list of things to
check out/get fixed.


Elwyn: You've mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now
looks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics
patch.&nbsp; We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done
regularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can
expect this glitch to be fixed?&nbsp; In addition, a recent patch made an
equipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our
wrists.

GZ: Well, i just fixed the horn.&nbsp; We should have a drum at some time - I
just don't know when.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I think we will try to sneak it in on our
next graphics patch.


Elwyn: Spellcasters, when they right click on a spell can see what skill the
spell uses.&nbsp; Why doesn't the bard spell book show what instrument skill is
required when you right click on a song?

GZ: Good question.&nbsp; I think I can get that added.


Elwyn: Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels, that they
aren't worth using.&nbsp; We don't need to be master of these, but if the caps
were raised such that at least they worked more than 1 out of 20 times, we
might consider putting them back into our hot keys.

GZ: A lot of these skills are 'given' to Bards, even though they won't ever
get good at them.&nbsp; I'll check on the caps with one of the programmers, but I
doubt that will change much.


Elwyn: It has been the case (since release) that playing Selo's when in an
outdoor zone, would 'break' the effects of the root spell.&nbsp; With a recent
patch, this is no longer the case.&nbsp; Was it a bug that it broke root
originally, or is it a bug that now it doesn't?&nbsp; When could we expect a fix
for this if it is a bug?

GZ: Selo's breaking root has been back and forth since Beta 1.&nbsp; We had it
breaking root for a while, but this proved to be just too powerful, since it
is a free song that bards keep mem'd all the time.


Elwyn: It is currently possible to cast SoW, or use Jboots, then enter an
indoor zone and enjoy enhanced speed for the next 30 minutes or so.&nbsp; This
seems to us a little unfair, as our song works only outdoors.&nbsp; Are there any
plans to either A) make Selo's work indoors, or B) to not allow SoW and
Jboots to work indoors?

GZ: Possibly.&nbsp; But remember - Bards are similar to Hybrid spell casters on
their power levels - they are not pure spell casters - their songs won't be
as powerful as a pure caster.


Elwyn: Bards currently don't have the ability to meditate.&nbsp; This is fine, we
don't really need or want it, and we understand that giving us meditate
would reduce the recovery time from the level 43 song.&nbsp; It does however take
us an inordinatly long amount of time to memorize our songs.&nbsp; Quite
literally, memorizing all our songs after a death takes at least ten times
as long as a caster.&nbsp; Is there any possibility of memorization time being
reduced in the future?

GZ: That is something that we will be talking about at our next tuning
meeting - possibly.


Elwyn: The level 28 song, Crisson's Pixie Strike seems to be bugged.&nbsp; When
used, 1 of 3 things may happen.&nbsp; 1, The mob is mezmerized and stands there
for ~12 seconds which is what we'd expect.&nbsp; 2, The mob resists the spell, we
get a resist message and nothing happens.&nbsp; This is also an expected result.
3, The mob is hit with the song, no resist message, and no mezmerize effect
takes place.&nbsp; This happens pretty often.&nbsp; It will often take 5 or 6 hits
with pixie strike (with no message) before a mob is truly mezmerized, after
which its relatively simple to keep the mez in place by repeatedly pixie
striking them.&nbsp; What is up with this lack of resist message yet no effect
taking place.&nbsp; This can easily be demonstrated by striking yourself.&nbsp; You'll
get the message to the effect that you've been struck, yet you can still
move about fine.

GZ: I'll check on that one - not sure.

GZ: Hope that helps a bit.&nbsp; :)
