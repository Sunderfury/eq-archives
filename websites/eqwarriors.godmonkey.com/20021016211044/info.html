<P>

Just in case you care, the server that godmonkey.com is running on is a dual Sparc 2 300mhz (Sun Enterprise 250) with 1024MB of RAM running slightly modified <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/" TARGET="_top">Apache</A> 1.3.3 on top of Solaris 7.  Our gracious hosts are the fine folks at Communitech at <A HREF="http://www.communitech.net" TARGET="_top">http://www.communitech.net</A>.  They are awesome!  Visit them.  Also, the sites on this server were created by one or more members of the Cygnus Design Group, whose domain is sadly no longer up.<P>

Does our domain name offend you?  Are you looking for a reason to be offended?  There are a couple of reasons for the name.  1. It was the name of our old Quake Clan.  2. In the movie The Prophecy, Gabriel refers to human beings as talking monkeys.  From that we extrapolate that GodMonkeys are monkeys who think they are better than other monkeys -- thus GodMonkey Quake Clan was born.  3. I'm afraid that's it =)<P>

So, are we godless heathens?  No, but we may not share all of your views, that's to be expected and celebrated.  I can't speak for everyone here, but I have a great relationship with the Creator.  There is a difference between religion/doctrine/ritual and spirituality/theophany.  So go ahead and love or hate as you choose and leave us to do the same.  I don't come to your house and piss in your hair, so don't come to my site and tell me I'm going to burn in hell.<P>
