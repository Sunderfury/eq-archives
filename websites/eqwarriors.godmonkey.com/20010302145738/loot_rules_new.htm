<p></font>Loot order:<br>
<br>
Prior to the raid, the list keeper will find out from each warrior what pieces of indico
and AAS's he/she has. ***(See notes below as to what can count as an AAS.) <br>
<br>
Once this has been done, those with the same number of pieces will be asked to roll
/random *appropirate number*. Those with 5 pieces, /random 500; those with 4 pieces,
/random 400; etc. - This is done to determine the looting order for those with the same
number of pieces. <br>
<br>
Should a warrior join the raid after the first legitimate pull, he/she will be added to
the bottom of the list as it stands at that time. <br>
<br>
Once a warrior has looted, he/she will be moved to the bottom of the list and looting will
cycle through in that order.<br>
<br>
Wishlist and Last piece are absorbed into the new system and will no longer be utilized as
separate looting rights.<br>
<br>
The order of the loot cycle will be determined by the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The person with the most pieces will be at
the top of the loot cycle, second to most next on the cycle, etc.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If there are warriors with the same number of
pieces of indico, the roll will determine the looting order among those warriors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If there are warriors with the equal numbers
of indico and AAS's, the warrior with more indico will loot ahead of the warrior with
less. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If there are warriors with the same number of
AAS's, the roll will determine the looting order among those warriors.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; In order for a warrior to be able to count AAS's, he/she must have at least
one piece of indico. If not, that warrior will be considered on equal standing for loot
order with warriors that have neither AAS's nor indico. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have replaced indico with an AAS, please bring your indico to the raid
should you wish to be higher up in the loot cycle. It must be seen by the list keeper to
count.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you claim an AAS, you will not be eligible to loot that same piece of
indico unless it is considered rotting. (See information below regarding rotting pieces)<br>
<br>
Looting and passing:<br>
<br>
If a piece of armor drops that the &quot;next-up&quot; warrior does not have, he/she can
choose to loot that piece or to pass it to the next warrior in the cycle. The same
decision will be made by that warrior, and so on until the piece is looted. Once you loot,
you will be moved to the bottom of the list. The number of times you may pass on armor
during a raid is unlimted.<br>
<br>
If a piece of armor drops that the &quot;next-up&quot; warrior has, (this includes AAS's),
this is not considered a pass. It will go the the person highest on the list that does not
have that piece - that warrior may choose to loot it or pass it as stated above.<br>
<br>
If a piece of armor is passed by all warriors or if all warriors have that piece of
indico, it will be considered rotting. Rotting armor will be looted in the order of those
with an AAS of the same piece in the original loot cycle. If none with the same AAS wish
to loot it, it will be looted in order of the original loot cycle. Looting rotting armor
does not count as your turn in the loot cycle. However, if a warrior is in need of the
piece that he/she previously passed, they must loot this piece and move to the bottom of
the loot order. If there is only one warrior without the piece of armor that drops, he/she
must loot that piece and move to the bottom of the loot order. He/She may not pass on it
to make it a rotting piece.<br>
<br>
***Additional Notes:<br>
AAS's (Acceptable Armor Substitues) are limited to the following at this time: Cobalt
Armor, Dragon Hero Bracer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All Warrior Only God weapons will be distributed by way of Random Roll among all
warriors present who have been in the zone for at least 5 hours and plan to take part in
the fight against the god in question. No drop weapons are to be randomed for PRIOR to
fighting the mob to avoid confusion. <br>
<br>
Current policy for Soul Leech and Spined Dragon claws is this: It is up to the leader of
the raid in question whether Soul Leech and Spined Dragon Claws will be limited to
Shadowknights and Rangers, or if warriors will be allowed to roll for them. <br>
<br>
In the Plane of Fear, due to the nature of the place, the warrior looting system will
apply UNLESS the raid leader wishes it otherwise with regards to god loots. The raid
leader should be followed if you intend to take part in the raid, although unfairness will
be noted. <br>
<br>
At no time will any warrior be allowed to posess more than one god weapon. If a warrior
has bloodfire and wishes to upgrade, they can random for another weapon provided they
agree to random bloodfire to the remaining warriors should they win something better. For
this to happen, all warriors present must agree. <br>
