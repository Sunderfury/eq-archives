<p align="center"><strong><big>Loot Rules <font color="#FF0000">(CURRENT and in process of
changing) </font></big></strong></p>

<p>All warriors present prior to the first pull of a raid /random to determine loot order
for that night. Prior to this roll, and warrior needing 3 pieces or less of indicolite can
elect to name an item they would most like to loot (ARMOR).The other warriors then vote,
if a majority vote in his/her favor, that person only loots if the piece they selected
drops. If the vote is majority against, the warrior in question will random for placement.
<br>
<br>
The Last Piece rule still applies, with one modification. Many warriors do not need or
want certain pieces of indicolite armor. Therefore, any warrior may select 2 pieces of
armor that they DO NOT want. These 2 pieces do not count against them when figuring last
piece eligibility. </p>

<p><font color="#000000">If more than one warrior asks for the same Wish List or Final
Piece, they will random roll to decide the order for that piece.<br>
<br>
Wish List and Final Piece claims must be made prior to random rolling for Loot list
placement. Basically, this is done to avoid the list and last piece rule becoming a means
to avoid dealing with an unlucky roll. For example, if someone needing boots, gloves, and
sleeves doesnt claim &quot;Wish List/Last Piece&quot; right until after they place last on
the random list for the night. Under our system, once you commit to a certain path, you
are stuck with it. </font><font size="-1"></p>
</font>

<p><font color="#000000">Also, once you claim Last Piece rights, you never again loot
another piece of armor unless it is rotting on a mob and no other warriors are present to
take it.<br>
</font><br>
A single bracer is all that is counted in cases of determining last piece eligibility,
unless the warrior in question wants 2 bracers. <br>
<br>
Helms will be a random roll for all those that wish to have it. As of this draft, Helm
does not count against you as far as loot turn is concerned. Helms are not randomed when
the 'wish list' or last piece rules are in effect. <br>
<br>
All warriors that join a raid after the first pull are placed at the end of the list in
order of arrival. Any warrior needing only one piece who join a raid after the first pull
are subject to a 2 hour limit before they can loot, unless the majority of the warriors in
the zone agree to waive it. <br>
<br>
All Warrior Only God weapons will be distributed by way of Random Roll among all warriors
present who have been in the zone for at least 5 hours and plan to take part in the fight
against the god in question. No drop weapons are to be randomed for PRIOR to fighting the
mob to avoid confusion. <br>
<br>
Current policy for Soul Leech and Spined Dragon claws is this: It is up to the leader of
the raid in question whether Soul Leech and Spined Dragon Claws will be limited to
Shadowknights and Rangers, or if warriors will be allowed to roll for them. <br>
<br>
In the Plane of Fear, due to the nature of the place, the warrior looting system will
apply UNLESS the raid leader wishes it otherwise with regards to god loots. The raid
leader should be followed if you intend to take part in the raid, although unfairness will
be noted. <br>
<br>
At no time will any warrior be allowed to posess more than one god weapon. If a warrior
has bloodfire and wishes to upgrade, they can random for another weapon provided they
agree to random bloodfire to the remaining warriors should they win something better. For
this to happen, all warriors present must agree. <br>
