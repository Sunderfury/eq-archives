<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dear Origin Systems
Incorporated and staff,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A person going
by the name of spirrow posted a message on Dr. TwisTer&#146;s<BR>
message board. He stated that OSI had replied to him saying that
&quot; it would<BR>
take at least 250 people e-mailing and asking for something new
in the<BR>
game.&quot; Here is a short essay I have written to show how much
we care about<BR>
this game. Creating worlds and playing god are no easy feat. This
is why we<BR>
petition you to make the game better for us, the customers. I
applaud you,<BR>
you have done something that is a great work of art. We all love
this game<BR>
and do not want to see it sink into a hole. Following are a few
problems,<BR>
proposals, and solutions.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Housing problemSolution:<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Make apartments</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">. Put them on a separate
map like Green Acres. Put a<BR>
tele-port in the bank. Use your key to your apartment on the tele-porter
and<BR>
you&#146;re in your apartment. This could be elaborated more.
Like if you have an<BR>
apartment you may not own a house. This would appeal to the merchant
class<BR>
because they would not have to leave the city to go to their homes
and they<BR>
could easily access their storage space while spamming at the
bank. <BR>
Make house boats. Boats already have a lot of space, but another
alternative<BR>
would be to cover it. Sort of like a pontoon boat. While I am
on the subject<BR>
of boats. What is the matter with having a forge and anvil on
a boat. I&#146;m<BR>
sure on any good pirate ship there would be one for making weapons
andarmour.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">HaircutsSolution:</FONT></B><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
Make barbering a skill. When a barber uses the barbering skill
a menu pops<BR>
up to show what style you want. As an extra bonus make an area
in the window<BR>
for gratitude sort of like the current trading window. This would
be a<BR>
little more realistic compared to this next proposal. Barbers
could make<BR>
hair coupons, which already exist and sell them to players for
modest<BR>
prices. Such as 50gp. You, OSI, could make hair grow. It could
be set up as<BR>
to grow in the order of Short-&gt;Curly-&gt;Pony tail-&gt; Long
hair. Something<BR>
similar could be made for facial hair.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Weapon problemsSolution:</FONT></B><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><BR>
Add a few new weapons. Throwing knives would be great. Roleplaying
thieves<BR>
would definitely use them. Throwing knives of course would have
to do more<BR>
damage. If they don&#146;t know one would even consider using
them. It would be<BR>
hard to differentiate between daggers and throwing knives. Just
naming them<BR>
different, but using the same graphic would be fine. Javalons
would be<BR>
nice. Instead of throwing spears you could throw javalons. Javalons
could be<BR>
configured to hit the same way arrows do. Accept a javalon would
puncture a<BR>
wooden shield. This would make it easier to figure out how you
are going to<BR>
attack. If you throw it you no longer have it, but a javalon through
the<BR>
stomach would most likely kill or at least make you stager. A
new style of<BR>
bows would also be useful. Longbows are in much need as would
horn bows be<BR>
nice. A longbow as it&#146;s name suggests would be able to shoot
from afar, but<BR>
would not be accurate, so a troop of archers could hale down arrows
upon<BR>
their enemies. Horns could be then used for what modern day calls
sniping.<BR>
They would be collapsible (I wish), good for short ranges, and
accurate to a<BR>
fair degree.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There is also
a realism problem with archery. When you shoot an arrow it<BR>
does not go around corners. The only way this could possibly happen
is if it<BR>
was magic. That kind of bow better be so rare it only occurs in
1:6 servers.<BR>
When shooting arrows you should have to fire an arrow where you
want it to<BR>
land. This means that if a person is running you would have to
shoot in<BR>
front of them to get a hit. If a person is running away from you,
back to<BR>
you, then hitting them in the back would be easier. Another funny,
but gory<BR>
idea would be make arrows stick out of people when you hit them.
If you keep<BR>
feathering someone you should be able to see the arrows or bolts.
Else the<BR>
arrows should fall to the ground or shatter. I know OSI will never
do this,<BR>
but I can dream. <BR>
At this moment in time, going by the T2A Guide for the New Age,
there are<BR>
as follows: 6 fencing weapons (including the dagger), 18 swordship
weapons<BR>
(3 being plain knives), 12 mace fighting weapons, and 3 ranger
weapons.<BR>
There are serious flaws in this. In truth there only five half
way decent<BR>
weapons fencers can use. The best weapon you can possibly have
is heavy<BR>
crossbow. So long as you keep moving you can dog anyone down that
doesn&#146;t<BR>
use archery. Then if they do use it, it comes down to who has
the bestarmour.<BR>
Some weapons have no link to the skill you have to master to use
them. I<BR>
have no idea how halberds relate to sword fighting. Halberds,
bardiches,<BR>
spears, short spears, and javalons should be classed as pole arms.
Being<BR>
able to throw a spear would be nice. A pole arm means you can
strike from a<BR>
distance. That is why they are so damn slow. The halberds in UO
now move at<BR>
a slow rate and you can&#146;t attack anything that isn&#146;t
right next to you.<BR>
Jousting should also be possible. I have no how this could be
possible in<BR>
this game.</FONT></P>

Some one on Dr. TwisTer&#146;s board said something like &quot;Why
not if you get<BR>
murder karma class then you turn red.&quot; OSI says that the
karma system was<BR>
created for npc-pc interaction only. It could be easily converted.
If you<BR>
drop below a certain level you turn red. Then you must do good
deeds such as<BR>
quests and killing monsters.</FONT></P>

Problems with this might be: Can you truly pull three<BR>
llamas behind you? Well the llamas would have to be very obedient
and loyal.<BR>
If not they would just pull you in the other direction. This would
solve the<BR>
problem of stupid llamas and other animals getting hung up on
trees and what<BR>
not. Have you ever really seen a person say &quot;llama follow
me&quot; and the thing<BR>
comply, not run away because it has no reins? Heck no! That llama
would be<BR>
gone the second you looked away.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hitching posts</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">. These were mentioned
before and I, and others, hope they<BR>
will be craftable items. You attach these to your house or in
your house. I<BR>
believe I have seen hitching posts in Delucia. They were outside
the stable<BR>
area. It looked like a post with a ring on the top of it.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Rugs</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">. We need rugs to decorate
our homes. All the home owners out there are<BR>
wanting rugs to cover the floor. There are not many choices for
floor<BR>
coverings. Chess boards, furs, bed rolls. Otherwise you can&#146;t
have beautiful<BR>
rugs like they do in the Britain bank. Also potted plants would
be nice toown.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Gohlems</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">. These were stated as
a possibility in the UOHoC irc board. A<BR>
combination tinker/smith/mage would be needed to build these great
works of<BR>
art. This comes from the idea that they are made from metal and
not stone.<BR>
This would be more feasible. Automatons were available in Ultima
VII why not<BR>
Ultima Online?<BR>
