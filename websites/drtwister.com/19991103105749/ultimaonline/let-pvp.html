<FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hello again good
Doctor *hehehehe*</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There have been
plenty of posts lately on a PvP switch for UO, far too<BR>
many than I can stand. Now is the time to enlighten the less bright<BR>
players on PvP switches.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">UO already has
a PvP switch and a damned good one at that. It's called<BR>
Guildwars and Orver/Chaos in UO..maybe they should have called
it PvP<BR>
for the less intelligent of players. If you join a guild that
is at war<BR>
with many guilds or an Order/Chaos guild you've toggled your PvP
switch<BR>
on!.  You are now at great risk to be attacked, gang-banged and
killed<BR>
ANYWHERE! at anytime....you are no longer safe in towns, guards
won't<BR>
help you, it's quite difficult to attempt to buy regs while you
notice<BR>
&quot;MastaKilla&quot; spearing you with a deadly posined pitchfork.
Your guard<BR>
has to be up at all times, you need to have your escape planned
before<BR>
you venture anywhere when you are a character in that situation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Now say you are
a humble player not interested in PvP and you don't<BR>
choose to get involved inPvP at all, you get angry when Captain
Red and<BR>
friends drop you faster than networks drop a bad TV show. Well
guess<BR>
what? this game is not just about YOU and your wishes, needs and
wants,<BR>
if you assume that then your attitude is just as selfish as those
PK's<BR>
you complain about.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You assume a risk
when you venture out of town guard zone..everyone<BR>
knows that, and OSI has that fact posted everywhere.  There are
plenty<BR>
of non-guarded monster laden zones players can go to and not run
into a<BR>
single PK. When is the alst time you saw a PK in Destard? the
5 level of<BR>
Despise? anywhere in T2A? they simply don't exist....the odd opportunist<BR>
may try to kill you because you turn grey, but that is a flaw
in the<BR>
reputaion system not a flaw of PvP.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">PK's should be
viewed like I envision OSI intended them to be, another<BR>
hazardous obstacle players encounter when they venture to the
more<BR>
dangerous areas of the land. This may be a less than stellar real
life<BR>
example but when you live in the city do you expect to be mauled
to<BR>
death by a grizzly bear? and if you go off to the mountains and
a<BR>
grizzly attacks and maims you, would you go running to your congressman<BR>
and demand that all bears be removed from those mountians as they
are<BR>
infringing on your right to enjoy the wilderness...you surely
didn't<BR>
choose to be mauled, the bear if to blame not yourself for you
should be<BR>
free to do what ever you please as long as nothing prevents you
from<BR>
doing what you want, you should be able to assume no risks when<BR>
traavelling anywhere (I hope you caught the sarcasim there)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">PvP in UO has
been designed rather well, I can't believe I just<BR>
complimented the Design Team, you have safe areas should you choose
not<BR>
to be involved in PvP, yet you should be aware that in UO as inlife
if<BR>
you venture to more dangerous areas of the land you should be
prepared<BR>
for bad things to happen and take the appropriate precautins to
prevent<BR>
them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I didn't post
this on your message board because I felt that I could<BR>
possibly persuade you to post this directly on your board to make
people<BR>
aware that what they are complaining about and begging for already<BR>
exists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On a side note
I would like to thank you for your message board and your<BR>
policy regarding posts. You allow many points of view and do not
take<BR>
the Draconian approach some baord moderators do with regards to<BR>
filtering what they think baord posters want to read. Rainman
at<BR>
Stratics for example, is clearly an OSI employee and go to great
lengths<BR>
to BAN people, such as myself, that continually post comments
that are<BR>
negative towards OSI and towards the Development team. Attitudes
like<BR>
your should be required of all message baord moderators</FONT></P>
