<BR>
Evil</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Joining evil</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You can sign up for being evil by merely
saying a key phrase at a shrine. There is a minimum character
age requirement for being able to join evil. This makes you permanently
red, and gives you the title of &quot;the Evil.&quot; In addition,
it puts &quot;[evil]&quot; over your head when you are looked
at. Looking at yourself if you are evil gives you your current
score and lifeforce values.<BR>
<BR>
Evil people are not automatically killed in justice regions, but
they are not allowed to resurrect at any shrines except the Chaos
Shrine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Evil killing people </FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The effects of evil people killing others
depends on the nature of the person being killed. The determination
of whether the victim died to an evil person is based on the amount
of damage done to the victim-the kill is considered to be &quot;by
an evil&quot; if the most damage done was done by an evil character.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Evil killing wisps</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wisps are a source of lifeforce. Hence evils
should try to kill wisps as much as they can in order to gain
lifeforce and points. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Evil killing innocents </FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When an innocent dies, they keel half over,
and then sparklies appear around them. After a brief moment, the
character's corpse is deleted. All items carried remain with the
ghost. The evil character's stats and skills are kicked down by
50% while the evil character &quot;loses lifeforce&quot; for five
minutes. During this time, they are also unable to recall or hide.
Lastly, this also costs the evil character points and lifeforce.
If the evil player has 0 points, then they can also be reported
for murder.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Evil killing paladins</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When a paladin is killed by an evil player,
they are fully lootable. In addition, it confers points and lifeforce
to the evil character, in a manner akin to the Abyss scoring system.
You cannot gain lifeforce at all if you have any murder counts.
At a certain point, the points you gain confer special powers.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Evil killing other evils</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is no effect from this.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Evil powers</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Elder players start with higher amounts
of initial points and lifeforce when they join evil. As you gain
standing in the evil hierarchy, you gain both points and lifeforce.
Special powers kick in when you reach certain amounts of points.
Each use of the power costs lifeforce, and if you do not have
sufficient lifeforce to use the power, you will have to go gain
more by killing paladins in order to use the power again.<BR>
<BR>
You can reach a menu of your powers by using a speech trigger,
&quot;I invoke my evil powers!&quot; Selecting the menu option
for a specific power then simply barks the words of power, to
be caught by a speech trigger. Alternatively, you can access a
power directly by using the words of power associated with the
power.<BR>
<BR>
The powers, in order of difficulty and in order of increasing
cost, are:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Black armor</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Saying the word, and then targeting an equipped
piece of armor, turns it true black. When unequipped, the armor
returns to its natural color. If you cease to be evil, the armor
returns to its natural color as well.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Detect Good</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This does a getPlayersInRange, and returns
information on the proximity of paladins.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Summon Familiar</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This summons a black wolf which is the evil's
pet. You cannot summon one if you already have one. This pet has
maxxed loyalty, but only lasts for a set period of time (say,
a half hour).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Vile Blade</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This makes your weapon have powerful poison
for the next few blows. Then the effect expires.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Unholy Steed</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This summons a black horse which is your
pet, with maxxed out loyalty. You cannot summon one if you already
have one.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Blight</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This does area effect damage to paladins
in range.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Monster Ignore</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This attaches the monster ignore script
to the evil person, for a fixed duration of time.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Unholy Word</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This brings up a targeting cursor allowing
you to target a paladin and instantly kill them. It does not confer
any points or lifeforce for the kill.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Paladins</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Becoming a paladin</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Merely killing evils increases your lifeforce
and your points. You cannot gain points while you are red, nor
while you have any short murder counts nor if you are a member
of the Thieves Guild. At a certain threshold, you are automatically
declared a paladin. You gain [paladin] over your head as well.
Looking at yourself if you are a paladin gives you your current
score and lifeforce values.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Paladins killing people</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Paladins killing innocents or paladins Being
reported for murder immediately sets your lifeforce and your points
to zero. In addition, you are prevented from gaining any lifeforce
or points while you still have the short murder count. In other
words, you are kicked out of paladinhood.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Paladins killing murderers</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This behaves exactly like anyone killing
a murderer now.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Paladins killing evil</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When you kill an evil, your lifeforce and
points increase using a scoring system akin to that on the Abyss.
The evil individual is fully lootable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Paladin powers</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The functioning of powers is by the same
interface style as for evil powers.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">White armor</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Exactly like the black armor power of evils.
This will require a patch of HUES.MUL so that all players are
running with the T2A hues, which includes the white hue required.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Detect Evil</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Exactly like the Detect Good power, except
it detects evils.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Summon Familiar</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Exactly like the evil version, except it
summons a dog (with equivalent stats to the black wolf's).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Holy Blade</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Effectively gives &quot;silver&quot; ability
to whatever weapon is wielded, for a brief while. This ability
does extra damage to undead and evils.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Holy Steed</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Just like the evil version, except the horse
is white.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Bless</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An area effect spell that gives a temporary
stat boost to all innocents in the effect range, excepting guild
enemies.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Holy Shield</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Uses the shield effect developed for potions.
Puts an enterrange trigger of 1 around the paladin, preventing
monsters or evils from approaching. Innocents however may still
approach.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">Holy Word</FONT></U><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Like Unholy Word for evils, except it only
harms evils.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">How innocents
fit in</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A principal goal of the system is to prevent
it from impinging too much on the normal gameplay of innocent
players.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Innocents dying to evil</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Evil is strongly discouraged from attacking
innocents, since evil loses 50% of all stats and skills temporarily,
plus loses lifeforce and standing, plus cannot loot.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Innocents dying to paladins</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This falls under the standard rep system.
In addition, it costs the paladin all of their paladin status,
and the paladin cannot loot that victim.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Innocents killing evil</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Innocents who kill evil enough will automatically
become paladins.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Innocents killing paladins</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is treated exactly like a standard
murder.<BR>
<BR>
