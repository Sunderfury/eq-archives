However, I imagine it has to do with the provocation skill getting
abused so bad.  Let's <BR>
  face it... provoking a daemon through a wall is pretty tough
to deal with<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; Yea....I figure - I just thought I would see
what the Dev Team had to say about it..<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; I actually think that will get asked tonight.  So
you will probably hear it from the <BR>
  horse's mouth so to speak.  :)<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; thanks<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; NP<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; I asked the moderators, so if you could get
it posted - I would appreciate it<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; DD is not here, so I don't know if anyone who is
knows the answer. <BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; If there is no one who knows the answer here, it
won't get posted.  I am guessing it <BR>
  won't.  Sorry.  I wish I had more for you to go on.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; NO... i just thought you were a moderator tonight,
so I posed the question to you, <BR>
  so that you can relay it to whatever Dev Team member is here
tonight!<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; I am a GM, the head GM.  <BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; :)<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; Although, I don't get to GM much anymore<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; More is the pity<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; Ahh<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; well then how come you are talking to me?  This
is strange... I thought OSI had a <BR>
  new policy to ingore me! :)<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; Not at all.  I believe you like the game.  I do
disagree with your methods, but if you <BR>
  were not passionate about the game, you would not have started
the site.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; good point<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; I can't make you go away, but maybe I can show you
that we are not a bunch of deaf ogres <BR>
  who never listen to our player base.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; well....<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; I have notice a larger EAR recently<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; but - still question some of the issues that
arise.<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; Yea.  We can't please everyone.  And face it, the
more you know about the game, the more <BR>
  you are going to discover that you don't like<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; But, you are also probably going to discover more
stuff you like<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; Same as anything else<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; I just happen to sincerely believe there is a lot
more to like than dislike<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; Well let's admit, the game is adicting, and
I feel that OSI as a company, sometimes <BR>
  looks at that, to make business decisions, that are not necissarily
the appropriate &quot;Customer <BR>
  service&quot; decisions.<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; Okay.  I can see that, especially from a player's
perspective.  This is an unusual <BR>
  service though.  Part of the difficulty lies in sometimes hurting
a player so you don't hurt <BR>
  the service as a whole.  It is usually a tough call.  My feeling
is I just want everyone in <BR>
  the game having fun<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; But sometimes, different definitions of fun mean
different things to different people<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; I completely agree with that statement<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; Then we have to make a decision.  Invariably, someone
is not going to like it.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; I feel there are two things that we need to
look at in regards to the service and <BR>
  how it effects the players.<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; We take it on the chin sometimes, but if we do so,
we generally have a reason.  It is <BR>
  just that reason is hard to swallow for a player sometimes.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; OSI must admit, they accomplished something
beyond all comprehension.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; But at the same time, because this type of service
is so new, they need to be able <BR>
  to adjust as well.<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; I think, no BS, that the players had a lot to do
with that.  Especially our counselors <BR>
  and seers.  Our volunteers kick much ass!<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; Look at the game industry - when it first started,
a programmer would release a <BR>
  game, and you would never hear of the programmer again.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; Didn't need to<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; His job was done<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; The game worked<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; and people bought it<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; played it, enjoyed it.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; Now we are in a world where a game is forever
changing<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; and players continue to play on a regular basis<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; The game industry in whole is not familiar with
this type of consumer envolvement<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; Yes, but they are becoming more aware.  The change
is from a product to a service.  I <BR>
  think it is just an expansion of the market, but I really like
the way it is going.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; I love the way it is going<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; But where the industry is coming from a product
/ consumer approach<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; My background is from a consumer / service background<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; this is basically where most of my frustrations
lay<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; Hey, I have to get back into my chat room.  It was
nice talking to you though.  Keep <BR>
  playing, and have fun.  :)  Take care.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; Thanks for the time!<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; Oh.. please if you can, answer me one final
question. I know this is where some of <BR>
  the player frustrations lay currently.<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; If I can<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; The guild MDK - Chessie - were banned.  20 members.
All who were on the Guild stone. <BR>
  Why?<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; Players who were not even in the game at the
time of the incident<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; were let go.<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; If you can answer this, great - if not, just
say no comment. I will let you go <BR>
  either way! THanks again.<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; Your numbers are exagerrated, but I can't discuss
account details at all with anyone but <BR>
  the account holder.  Let me say this though<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; I would never ban anyone for PKing<BR>
&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; ok. thanks again<BR>
&lt;Grond&gt; I know that is not the answer you were looking for,
but I hope it helps.<BR>
