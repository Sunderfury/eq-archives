<p><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Proposal for
Skill Point Change </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Arial">by - </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As I was talking
this over with some of my Uo friends, here are some of the<BR>
things that we came up with. With all the new skills and needs
for those<BR>
skills coming up in UO we decided plain and simple the 700-750
softcap for<BR>
BASE skills is simply too low. WAY WAY too low. Here is a proposed
change</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There are many
many skills in UO that we all have to pick up from time to<BR>
time, even the biggest baddest warrior needs to hide occasionally.
So he may<BR>
tend to have 50-60, maybe 65 hiding if he hides a LOT. Our sugegstion
is to<BR>
make skills NOT count unless they break a certain limit (this
could be based<BR>
on a PER skill basis). For example if there is a bad ole' warrior
who had<BR>
98.8 hiding, the fact is he worked, and macroed that hiding up
that high -<BR>
therefore it is obviously a skill he wanted and feels he needed.
so our<BR>
suggestion would be this. Let's say hiding is a free skill up
to 60 hiding.<BR>
if you get 100 hiding then you now consume 40 base skill points
intsead of<BR>
100.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The fact is we
ALL need a LITTLE of every skill. We need to be able to cook<BR>
occasionally to make ourselves ribs, we need to be able to pitch
a tent and<BR>
sleep, and start a campfire.. I personally have 67 camping beacuse
i log out<BR>
in the woods ALL the time. I have never WORKED on gaining camping
skill. So<BR>
camping would be another one of those skills that would have a
HIGH free<BR>
tolerance. maybe 70-80 FREE camping before it charges you any
skill cap<BR>
points. so if you were a GM camper you'd only require 20 skill
points above<BR>
the free cap on camping.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">However this would
NOT be the case with combat or magery type skills. These<BR>
are generall skills that REQUIRE work even at the smallest level.
Let's say<BR>
all weapon skills were free up to about 30. (we all pick up a
spear from<BR>
time to time to goof off, so at least we know how to use one,
we're just not<BR>
proficient with it) - beyond 30 we actually have to TRAIN to knwo
how to use<BR>
that weapon  better, therefore it would require skill points.
Magery could<BR>
be set the same, casting 1st and 2nd circle spells is pretty easy
to do,<BR>
read the words off your book, and wa-lah, you have a fat &quot;ham&quot;
for you to<BR>
eat. However for the occasional fireball or lightning bolt, you'd
have to<BR>
study magery much more. So maybe magery is &quot;free&quot; up
to 25-30 or so. (to<BR>
make it more realistic this could be a sliding scale based on
intelligence -<BR>
obviously the smarter you are the more you coudl learn about magery
without<BR>
taxing your brain.. perhaps maxing out at 35 or 40)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here is the motive
behind all this. With the new changes to &quot;rogues&quot; going<BR>
in. a steretypical &quot;rogue&quot; in the D&amp;D sense would
have the following skills<BR>
and be GM'd in all of them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Fencing, tactics,
archery, detect hidden, detect traps, hiding, snooping,<BR>
stealing, sneaking (stealth), pick locks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The problem is
that is 10 skills not 7, and makes it impossible to be a good<BR>
all around rogue. with the proposed change it would look more
like this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Skill        
Free        Used      Total<BR>
Fencing       30          70         100 (gm)<BR>
tactics       30          70         100 (gm)<BR>

TOTALS:       370         630        1000</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you'll notice
things like detect hidden/traps, and hiding have a very<BR>
high &quot;free skill&quot; rate, because those are skills that
ANY person as a UO<BR>
adventurer would need to use, regardless of their proficiency.
One could<BR>
look at this as a &quot;common knowledge&quot; factor - However
skills like picklocks,<BR>
and stealing have a very low &quot;free&quot; threshold because
you HAVE to want to<BR>
learn those things and have to work at them from the beginning
to get good<BR>
at them. Therefore they have a very LOW amount of &quot;common
knowledge&quot; factor<BR>
programmed into them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With the proposed
change, it is possible to have a much more rounded<BR>
character, and the numbers above are just suggestions, and certainly
have<BR>
not been well thought out. This would allow someone to play a
role to it's<BR>
fullest without running against the hard skill cap as it stands
currently.<BR>
