<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hello</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">    Today, i was
put in jail and given a word of warning from Gm Loki abot<BR>
the number of complaints tha have been  sent in, he warned me
that i should<BR>
either change my style of play or be banned.  This totally unacceptable,
i<BR>
have played on the baja shard since before it was put up, and
have created<BR>
one of the strongest guilds on the baja shard, my guild The cult
of the 7<BR>
Sins, has always been evil and hated by most others, since we
loot, steal,<BR>
pk, all factions of our guild abide by the rules of uo.<BR>
    As for myself, all i simply do is, use my fencer/bard to kill
greys, its<BR>
that simple, but because the number of greys i kill is large,
they newer<BR>
player seem fit to  call a gm, if they can cast a blade spirit,
and i make<BR>
them grey, and then i kill them, they cant handle that, dont cast
it, its<BR>
simple, but as a result of my pvpr being good, they cannot kill
me, either i<BR>
run into a room full of them, loot one of their fallen comrades
and bail,<BR>
this kind of action is frowned on by osi ? this is part of the
game which i<BR>
excel at, Gm Loki's advice was to &quot;change my playing style,
we would rather<BR>
have 15 happy customers and lose 1&quot;, if they are grey, they
are open season,<BR>
its not my fault oif they helped save a friends items and went
grey, not is<BR>
it my concern, if i proceed to attack them, and they cry about
it, they took<BR>
the action of going grey to save items, which makes them vulnerable
and fore<BR>
which i can attack them, having numerous enemies in T2A, such
as TDW,TTW<BR>
etc, going all out taking murder counts trying to kill me, while
i still end<BR>
of killing at least one of them while they are grey, is the Game.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">    To tell me
to change my style is uncalled for, i pk, im good at it,<BR>
victims have said in T2a, &quot;u used a bug, u followed my recall
to this bank&quot;<BR>
this is absurd, there are 2 banks in t2a, if i make somone recall,
and they<BR>
are grey, of course im going to scour both banks looking for them.
But of<BR>
course, he is going to call a gm and whine and complain, about
how i kileld<BR>
him, he didnt mention the fact that 3 of them attacked me and
i provoked<BR>
titans onto the group as i fought them, and then followed one
member who was<BR>
severly hurting to the bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">    So in other
words, what Gm Loki was saying in fact was, stop pking the<BR>
newbies or we will ban you, its part of the game, if i cheated,
or if  i<BR>
used 3rd party programs to accomplish this, then yes ban me, but
i do not,<BR>
while the people i kill can come back n scream and use extremely
verbal<BR>
harrassment towards me, and what happens to them ? nothing at
all, because<BR>
im a pk, which is totally biast. In a statement by osi it claimed
;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Origin does
not ban capriciously, nor would we ban for something we<BR>
consider to be an integral part of the game.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">    Thats exactly
what i do, i kill greys and loot bodies with one<BR>
particular character Townsend, who is primed and set for just
that,if i see<BR>
them cast a blade spirit, or a energy vortex, i provoke the summoned
monster<BR>
onto myself, thus making them grey, thus a target, to which i
attack and<BR>
kill. But the people i kill would complain and whine to the sympathtic
ear<BR>
of the gm , nothing i do is illegal, its part of the game.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">    In short,
i see my actions to which i play part of the game, and the<BR>
warning i recieved was uncalled forth, and i will continue to
play in such a<BR>
manner that is within the rules of the game, i abide by the rules
and play<BR>
by the rules, while i see countless others who constantly use
last target<BR>
and other devices of known 3rd party progs, nothing is done to
them, there<BR>
have  even been ppl i kill who complement me on my tactics i use,
im smart<BR>
about my victims, and to quote Graymane of FoB, whom i have killed
numerous<BR>
times, and have actually gotten keys to his hosue n have had temporily<BR>
access,&quot; he hads spice to the game&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">    I have nothing
further to say except that i will continue on my style of<BR>
play, and if you think that violates the code, then you should
ban half of<BR>
the Baja Shard, all you would have left is newbies running around
mining,<BR>
tailoring and constantly getting killed by drakes, wryms and rats,
one of<BR>
the main aspects of uo, is PvP, to remove that is to remove  the
very heart<BR>
of uo.</FONT></P>
