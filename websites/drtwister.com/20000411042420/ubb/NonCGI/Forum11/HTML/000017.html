</FONT><HR>I sent this message to Verant's Feedback and serval employees and executives several days ago hoping for some feedback on a problem I was experiencing with their game.  Now 3 days after their "Will be replied to within 2 days", message acknowledgement email, I post it in hopes that someone will read it and give me some sort of feedback. <P>Names were dotted over to protect the innocent... If any Verant employee wishes to know the real names check in your Feedback emails and look for the message with the subject, "Troubles... (Please Read")<P>"Greetings,<P>I bought Everquest in hopes of a real change, and in many ways I got it!  But recently my view of EQ has been slipping back to the level of my view of UO... But not because of the game quality or playablity.  I truly love the game.  However, the abilities given to the GMs are entirely inadequate.  I am not saying they aren't helpful, cheery, and, on a whole, good people; I am saying that the limitations that the Lead GMs of the server possess make them inadequate to actually help people suffering from bugs.  I shall, if I may, take a bit of your time to explain why I have come to this conclusion.<P>My first bug:<BR>The first character I ever created was a High Elf Paladin named F******.  I excelled at playing him, and, at one point, I was the highest level player on the server.  F****** had a beautiful suit of small steel armor, and wielded a Ghoulbane and a Crested Mistmoore Shield.  However, one day, when F****** was adventuring in Castle Mistmoore, he was caught in a train and died.  When he returned to the scene, his body was no where to be found.  He petitioned to the head GM G****, and G**** was able to verify his story and granted a retribution for the death.  HOWEVER, at the time, the only thing Gharn could do was give him Issued Armor, that did not even equal leather, and an Issued Two Handed Sword that wasn't even near the quality of the Ghoulbane.  (I then got upset, and deleted my F****** character.)<P>I understand that G**** did everything he could for me at the time, and I am, in fact, grateful for it.  I am happy that if it would have happened now, G**** could have restored my whole inventory.  However, from my recent experience, I know that the GMs still do not have enough abilities.  Let me, if I may, take a bit more of your time to explain my current predicament.<P>My current problem:<BR>I am the person who wrote the "When NPCs Get Mad" article currently on the Dr. TwisTer Everquest Website (I am saving a copy of it and will email the whole to you if you wish), where I praised the new Lead-GM of my server, T*****, for her willingness to help and expressed my discontentment about the limitation on her ability to help me.  The bug, simply put, was, when I attacked something around anything that conned "Amiable" or better, the thing that conned "Amiable" became hostile and came after me.  I killed myself in front of people for two months to get the GMs attention because, as I must admit myself, my bug is so unlikely that it is hard to believe that it was actually happening (in fact, in many places it is still happening).<P>Obviously, in two months of repetitively killing myself in front of people to get the GMs’ attention, I lost a TON of EXP and playing time.  I hoped that when the GMs finally saw that I was telling the truth (which I proved that I was) the Lead GM would be able to compensate  for those losses imposed upon me by the game.  In short, I was told, "Ask your friends and guild mates for help."  So I am supposed to impose upon my friends to recover from problems imposed upon me by the game... That isn't right at all.<P>It was because of my hopes that you could improve for the future that I decide to post on Dr. TwisTer, but since then almost all of the GM Admins, including T*****, have taken a rude, almost snide, attitude toward me.  I requested a simple deletion of my last name to further my roleplaying.  A Senior Guide picked up my request and sent it on to T***** with the words, "Wonderful! I will send this up the ladder!"  T*****, about half an hour later, sent me a tell rudely stating, "We don't do surname changes." She then would not respond to any of my tells in response to that.  I then told my guild what she said, and four people burst out laughing because just two weeks before they ALL received surname changes.<P>I was disheartened by the fact that there was no way that I could be compensated, but when I figured out that I was being ignored by the GMs now and couldn't become a true brother in my guild, I became very upset and very saddened.  My game play is now not only being imposed upon me by the bugs in the game but also by the people who are there to make the game better and more playable.  I do not know all that much, but I do know that I am being wronged.  I do hope that you can right this wrong, so that Everquest is a bit more playable.  I don't know what to say so that I don't sound threatening or whiny, but I really want the mistakes fixed and my time in EQ justified.<P>I do hope that you will have the courtesy to respond to my email since I have taken the time to write to you in hopes of improving my and other's enjoyment of your great game."<P>Please reply to this tell me what you think!<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HRE
