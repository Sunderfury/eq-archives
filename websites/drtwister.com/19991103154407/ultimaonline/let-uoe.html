<p><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">My Opinion on UOE - By
Protofear</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ya it use to let you be able to see hidden
people, but now it's nothing more than a handy utility. All the
newbies can argue, bitch, moan, and gripe all they want, but I
say don't knock it until you have tried it. <BR>
All UOE/UOA/UOP does is let you use your keyboard instead of your
mouse? Is that &quot;cheating&quot; (OSI's label on 3rd party
use)?? I don't think so. <BR>
 <BR>
It's just like in flight SIMMs You have access to all your options
via your mouse, but your still have the ability to hit hotkeys
on your keyboard to access those features quickly. It's handy
being able to use a potion or a bandage with one button instead
of using that clunky point and click interface. It's great being
able to equip/unequip your weapon with one hotkey. Well, that's
what UOE allows. That's what players want. <BR>
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The point and click interface is great for
single player games but come on; this isn't exactly a single player
game is it?<BR>
I tried making a couple of fancy shirts since OSI's latest attempt
to stop macroing and I swear I actually got a cramp in my finger.
WTF? Hey, I can load up UOE and set it to automatically target
the cloth in my pack and save my poor guitar fingers from more
unnecessary strain, plus I can also use my time more wisely and
do more productive things besides UO. I <B>PERSONALLY</B> wanna
adventure in the game not make things like shirts or bows.<BR>
 <BR>
The only way OSI can ever truly eliminate 3rd Party Use is by
getting rid of the things that make people want to use them and
all UOE does is make your UO interface easier to use. It doesn't
allow for massive &quot;cheating&quot; as OSI would like you to
believe.<BR>
 <BR>
Ya see, I have a theory about OSI and 3rd party programs.<BR>
 <BR>
Basically I think that OSI wants it to be hard on you. They don't
want you to be able to quickly do things as UOE allows. They want
you to be a mindless zombie sitting in front of your monitor making
shirts for hours upon hours and all the while giving them your
hard earned money. If they made things easier for us, then that
would result in the players getting satisfied sooner and in the
long run would result in them getting less money. That's a no
no. So their tactic is to draw things out to make you have to
play for longer. This kinda reminds me of the &quot;You must wait
to perform another action&quot; message.<BR>
 <BR>
That's kinda a low blow if you ask me.<BR>
 <BR>
I refuse to play by the rules as long as a company that practices
such low tactics is making them. When I say rules I am referring
to the User Agreement that all anti 3rd party program users constantly
shove in my face.<BR>
 <BR>
What's the harm in being able to set your best friend as an object
and being able to heal him with one button?? <BR>
 <BR>
Have you ever seen your friends health drop to almost death??
Well, you quickly cast GHeal and are about to heal him when he
realizes that he is almost dead and bolts. Right when your target
cursor comes up he starts running for his life while the whole
time you are thinking &quot;HOLD STILL DAMNIT!&quot; Your friend
ends up dying because you couldn't get that heal in. This results
in your friend having to play longer to get back to where he was
before. OSI likes this. This is what OSI wants.<BR>
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">UOE doesn't allow people to magically kill
you. It only let's you do mundane things like drinking potions,
equipping/unequiping, using bandages, and targeting self without
using your mouse.<BR>
 <BR>
A bonus to all this is that there are FAR more uses for UOE and
they have nothing to do with PvP at all.<BR>
 <BR>
I can instantly use as many shovels or mortars as I please with
the push of <B>ONE</B> button. I can mine a spot dry with <B>ONE</B>
button. I can make over 100 GH potions in less than 3 minutes
all with <B>ONE</B> button. <BR>
 <BR>
Playing UO with UOE is a far greater experience for the player
who just wants to have fun and doesn't wanna make a life on UO.
I have real life things to do and my UO time is VERY limited so
anything that helps me maximize my online UO time is a welcome
thing.<BR>
OSI: Give us the ability to use our keyboards to do some of the
more tedious and repetitive tasks in UO and watch the number of
3rd party users decline. <BR>
 <BR>
To the anti UOE / UOA/ UOP users out there:<BR>
 <BR>
You could learn a life lesson from this right here: Don't go by
what you've heard and what other people have told you! Try it
yourself and make up your own mind. Don't let OSI make up your
mind for you.<BR>
