<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">TERMS OF SERVICE
FOR COUNSELORS<BR>
Version 1.0<BR>
April 7, 1999</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Introduction</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">These Terms Of
Service for Counselors is an agreement<BR>
between you, the applicant (&#147;Counselor&ouml;), and Origin<BR>
Systems, Inc. (&#147;OSI&ouml;), of the conditions under which
you<BR>
agree to undertake the task of being a Counselor for OSI&#146;s<BR>
online game, Ultima Online (&#147;UO&ouml; or &#147;the Game&ouml;).
Upon<BR>
being accepted to theUO volunteer counselor program (the<BR>
&#147;Counselor Program&ouml;), each applicant is required to
sign and<BR>
return a copy of these Terms of Service to OSI, at an address<BR>
to be specified upon acceptance. No applicant will receive<BR>
final approval for Counselor status or training, and will not
be<BR>
assigned special Counselor commands and abilities, until a<BR>
signed copy of these Terms of Service has been received by<BR>
OSI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1.General Responsibilities:
The Counselor Program is a<BR>
volunteer service organization; we are here to help others<BR>
when they run into unusual difficulties during the normal<BR>
course of play. This takes the form of: monitoring the Help<BR>
Request Queue for calls for assistance from subscribers;<BR>
respondingto those calls; determining if the call should be<BR>
handled immediately by the Counselor or forwardedto a<BR>
Game Master, and; following up to insure that the subscriber<BR>
is satisfied that his request hasbeen dealt with.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">These duties and
the manner in which they are handled is<BR>
covered more fully in the Counselor Rules and Guidelines, a<BR>
copy of which will be made available to you after you have<BR>
signed and returned theterms of Service for Counselors to<BR>
OSI. You may also find more information on the Counselor<BR>
Web site at<BR>
.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2.The UO Terms
of Service: In addition to these Terms of<BR>
Service for Counselors, all Counselors areexpected to<BR>
adhere to the UO Subscriber Terms of Service, published<BR>
online at<BR>
and hereby incorporated into this document.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3.Other Documents
and Game Changes: In addition to<BR>
these Terms of Service and the UO Terms of Service, OSI<BR>
sometimes modifies or adds to the Terms of Service via the<BR>
Counselor Rules and Guidelines document and the<BR>
Counselor Web site, both available to you at<BR>
. We also note changes to the game itself, such a new<BR>
features and modification of stat or skill gain procedures.<BR>
Once accepted into the Counselor Program, you are<BR>
expected to read these periodically and conform to any<BR>
changes, additions and modifications to the Terms of<BR>
Service for Counselors, and to be familiar with changes in<BR>
the Game. If you have any questions about these, please<BR>
contact your supervisor for clarification.<BR>
4.Non-Disclosure Agreement: When you&#146;re on the team,<BR>
you will occasionally need certain confidential information<BR>
to be able to do your part. Because of that, we may make<BR>
sensitive information available to you, information that, in<BR>
some cases, we don&#146;t want discussed outside of the group<BR>
for a period of time. Therefore, you agree that you will not<BR>
discuss any such confidential information we impart to you<BR>
in the course of your duties as a Counselor with anyone<BR>
outside of the Counselor Program or OSI&#146;s official Game<BR>
representatives. We&#146;ll clearly note when such information
is<BR>
confidential, be it verbally transmitted, via online chat,<BR>
posted on the Counselor Web site or delivered to you in<BR>
email or any other method.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5.Prerequisites
for Being a Counselor: Any current UO<BR>
player aged 25 years or older and with no outstanding UO<BR>
billing issues is eligible to apply for the Counselor Program.<BR>
Applying for the Counselor Program is no guarantee that<BR>
you will be accepted; OSI reserves the right to grant or deny<BR>
any such application at its sole discretion. Note also that it<BR>
is OSI&#146;s policy not to allow Counselors to play characters
on<BR>
the same Shard(s) on which they pull Counselor duty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You may not become
a Counselor in any case if:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You are under
25 years of age. Proof of age is required<BR>
prior to commencing training;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Work either in-house,
under contract, or as a volunteer in<BR>
any capacity for a computer game company, online games<BR>
aggregator or a competing online game product. By signing<BR>
and returning this form toOSI, you certify that you do not<BR>
presently work for such a company and/or competitor in any<BR>
capacity and that, while a member of the Counselor<BR>
Program, you will immediately inform OSI if you do accept<BR>
work with such a competitor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6.Training Course:
Because there are new and quite<BR>
powerful commands and abilities available to Counselors,<BR>
all applicants for Counselor will be required to take and<BR>
pass an online training course before being posted for<BR>
regularly scheduled duty. At present, the training course is<BR>
expected to takea minimum of six hours and a maximum of<BR>
twelve hours. Scheduling times for the training course will<BR>
be by arrangement between the Counselor and the person<BR>
assigned as trainer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7.Regularly Scheduled
Shifts: All Counselors are required<BR>
to commit and adhere to a regular schedule of duty<BR>
consisting of three two-hour shifts per week. Every<BR>
reasonable attempt will be made by OSI to accommodate<BR>
your preferences in the scheduling of duty time; this is a<BR>
subject that should be discussed and worked out to the<BR>
satisfaction of everyone involved at the time your<BR>
application is accepted. Your tentative schedule, based on<BR>
that conversation and pending attendance at the training<BR>
course, if applicable, will be noted in the space provided<BR>
below. Regular duty schedules will be maintained and<BR>
posted on the Counselor Web site at<BR>
. If you have any questions about your schedule, please<BR>
contact your direct supervisor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">8.Missing a scheduled
shift: In order to provide consistency<BR>
of service and to be fair to the players and the other<BR>
Counselors, you are expected to show up for duty during the<BR>
shifts you commit to. Anyone who misses one or more<BR>
scheduled shifts without first contacting his/her direct<BR>
supervisor may be temporarily or permanently dismissed<BR>
from the Counselor Program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">9.Held to a Higher
Standard: When on duty, Counselors are<BR>
considered representatives and &#147;ambassadors at large&ouml;
for<BR>
OSI and the Game and, thus, are held to a higher standard<BR>
of behavior than the average player. Counselors on duty<BR>
are expected to treat subscribers and other Counselors with<BR>
dignity,respect, courtesy and professionalism at all times.<BR>
Counselors who are rude, discourteous or who don&#146;t<BR>
consistently make a positive contribution to OSI&#146;s image<BR>
and the Game community may be permanently or<BR>
temporarily dismissed from the Counselor Program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">10.Abuse of Powers:
As a Counselor, you will have access<BR>
to special commands and abilities which, if abused, could<BR>
significantly alter the balance within the Game. Any abuse<BR>
of Counselor abilities and commands will be grounds for<BR>
immediate and permanent dismissal from the Counselor<BR>
Program and, depending on the severity of the abuse and<BR>
at the discretion of the Director of Player Relations,<BR>
mayalso be grounds for terminating your UO player<BR>
account. Abuse is defined as:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Using your special
Counselor abilities to modify, add to,<BR>
change or in any way create an advantage for any player<BR>
without the express permission of the designated OSI<BR>
supervisor or Game Master;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Using your special
Counselor abilities to modify, add to,<BR>
change or in any way create a disadvantage or hardship for<BR>
or to harass any player, Counselor or other OSI<BR>
representative;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Using your special
Counselor abilities to modify, add to,<BR>
change or in any way create an advantage for any of your<BR>
account&#146;s characters;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Using your Counselor
abilities in any manner not<BR>
prescribed in the Counselor Guidebook, a copy of which<BR>
you will receive when you begin training;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Or, in cases not
covered by the Guidebook or the<BR>
Counselor&#146;s experience, using those Counselor abilities<BR>
without prior approval by the designated OSI supervisor or<BR>
Game Master on duty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">11.Consideration:
In consideration for your time<BR>
volunteered as a Counselor, your player account will be free<BR>
of any monthly subscriptions fees charged by OSI to its<BR>
customers for access to the Game. This includes all the<BR>
characters created on that account for play on any UO<BR>
shard. You continue to be responsible for any ISP fees and<BR>
local or long distance telephone charges necessary to allow<BR>
you to connect to and access the game servers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&gt;From time
to time, based entirely on availability and at the<BR>
sole discretion of OSI, the company sends to all or some of<BR>
the Counselors OSI game products and marketing items<BR>
such as T-Shirts, cups, pens, posters and the like. OSI<BR>
makes all reasonable efforts to insure that such games and<BR>
marketing items are distributed equitably, but can make no<BR>
guarantees that any Counselor will receive such game<BR>
products or marketing items.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">12.Ownership of
the Account: Because your account will<BR>
have access to the special Counselor abilities and<BR>
commands, you agree that during your involvement in the<BR>
Counselor program, you will not sell or transfer your game<BR>
account, nor allow any 3rd Party access to your Counselor<BR>
character in any manner without the prior written consent of<BR>
OSI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">13. Termination
by OSI: Your affiliation with the Counselor<BR>
program can be terminated at any time by OSI, for any or no<BR>
reason and at its sole discretion. If your participation in the<BR>
Counselor program is terminated you will be required to<BR>
remove the Counselor character from your account.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">14. Termination
by Counselor: If you decide you don&#146;t want<BR>
to be a Counselor any more, for whateverreason, you can<BR>
terminate your affiliation as a Counselor at any time with no<BR>
hard feelings on our part. We do ask that you don&#146;t leave
us<BR>
in a lurch and give us at least one weeks&#146; warning, so thatwe<BR>
have the opportunity to fill your shifts without having to<BR>
scramble at the last minute to do so.If you do decide to<BR>
terminate your affiliation as a Counselor you will be required<BR>
to forfeit your Counselor character. This will mean simply<BR>
deleting the character from your menu or having it done by<BR>
OSI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">15. Leave of Absence:
We understand that the demands of<BR>
real life can sometimes intrude on the game, or that you<BR>
can just plain &#147;burn out,&ouml; and that it is sometimes<BR>
necessary to take extended time off from being a<BR>
Counselor. If you and your supervisor agree, dependent on<BR>
the final approval of the Director of Player Relations, you<BR>
may take a leave of absence of two weeks to four months<BR>
from your regularly scheduled shifts without dropping out of<BR>
the Counselor Program altogether.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If for some reason
we can&#146;t agree to your request for a leave<BR>
of absence, you can drop from the Counselor Program with<BR>
no hard feelings. You will always be welcome to reapply for<BR>
the Counselor Program at a later date.<BR>
