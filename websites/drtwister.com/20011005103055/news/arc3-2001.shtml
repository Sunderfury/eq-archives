A Test<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Friday, April 27, 2001   2:00 AM EST by <a href="mailto:mrorange@drtwister.com" class=link2>Mr.Orange</a></font><a href="mailto:mrorange@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes a week ago I conducted a test. I told a few friends about it. WHat i did was hint at EQ's 1st duel power guild mergeron fennin ro. Now this was never a fact nor was it going to be a possability. The point of this was to see how many would take this idea and scatter to become the 1st or even the 3rd. Povar,Veeshan,Drinal,Druzzil,Bert ALL have had 2-5 major guilds merge to form 1 giant guild on each of these servers JUST in the last 7 days )<br><br>And they say you cant control peoples minds with media. pfft.<br> <br>To all the blind,unknowing participants who helped my test, i thank you. What i did was by planting an idea ,set into  motion an idea that people are sheep in EQ for the most part. They choose to be uber and desperatly scramble to try and define themselves so they can think " Yah now im uber" Well congrats guys,. enjoy your new guilds. My next test will be to see what TRUELY powerful guild will be formed by the ashes of these shaky alliances.<br><br>To the true EQ player,those who play the game as intended and dont try to be GOD to compensate for real life short-commings,i apologize for this temporary situation , as I'm sure it will be hell for you.<br>

Words of Wisdom<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Thursday, April 26, 2001   2:00 AM EST by <a href="mailto:mrorange@drtwister.com" class=link2>Mr.Orange</a></font><a href="mailto:mrorange@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Georgia, a player on fennin ro, a staff member at Everlore and a complete ass to me said some things that we should all ponder on... A friend over at CLAW re-posted her words so i grabbed them from him ) Read on.......<br> <p><br><blockquote>Its interesting. Coming from a non uber, once a month( if lucky) plane running guild.. We have fun by ourselves, we dont need a 80 man guild where people know other people because they are there to help you get items. We are there for each other and have a blast playing EQ. What do you guys think about this?<br><br>I&#8217;ve played EverQuest for over two years now. I&#8217;ve beta tested. I&#8217;ve role-played. I&#8217;ve<br>adventured. I&#8217;ve leveled, and I&#8217;ve gone for the epics. Although the game still holds me<br>closely to it&#8217;s bosom after all of this time, I have found that perhaps players have lost a<br>sense of morality and honor. Is this the &#8220;phat lewt&#8221; fever? Perhaps. Perhaps not. <br>Players today are driven by one hope, and that is to &#8220;beat&#8221; EverQuest. Why beat it?<br>There is no end-goal other than perhaps reaching level 60 and owning the best<br>equipment available to one&#8217;s class and/or race. These players are so driven by their lust<br>for &#8220;lewt&#8221; that they have become monsters to their former friends and guilds. They rush<br>to battles one after the other&#8230; Gorenaire in the Dreadlands&#8230; Trakanon in Old Sebilis&#8230;<br>and of course, the famed &#8220;hot spot&#8221; Ragefire in Nagafen&#8217;s Lair&#8230; all for loot. Morality<br>stops here. Care for those who have spent hours attempting to kill a specific mob has<br>been laid to waste by larger guilds with loot hungry minds that rush in at the last second<br>to &#8220;steal&#8221; something that smaller guilds worked very hard to achieve. GMs? What are<br>those? Are they creatures I create for my children&#8217;s fairy tales? They know not of the<br>situations that occur behind their backs. <br><br>Oh, it is true that many larger guilds are quite noble, though there are some, unnamed by<br>me, that strive to crush those that get in their way. These guilds, once friends of many,<br>grew, changed, but allowed their morals and honor to deteriorate as they progressed in<br>the game. They no longer desire to be friendly and respectable of the trials and torture<br>that smaller, lower-level guilds have to go through to make it to the top of the server<br>food chain; they only desire their loot. <br><br><br>Take the epic quests for example. They are meant to be epic in every way, shape, and<br>form. Players unite to gather the items for these wonderful weapons, though the end<br>always seems to trip them. Guilds fight over something as trivial as Ragefire, for example.<br>A mob, which spawns every 0 to 90 hours (variable spawn time), is the last part needed<br>to complete the cleric epic quest. Every 90 hours, GMs have to deal with fights between<br>as many as four guilds over this bundle of 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s in a virtual world. Is this epic? Is<br>this what Verant really wants us to go through when attempting to complete our quests?<br>Petty arguments ensue between guilds over these items&#8230; over loot. Is there honor left in<br>EverQuest? Maybe&#8230; I hope and dream that it remains. <br><br><br>There are some, who allow themselves to be walked all over, so they don&#8217;t end up<br>stooping to the record low of many guilds. This isn&#8217;t meant to be an attack upon those<br>who run from uber spawn to uber spawn hoping for their lovely &#8220;phat lewtz;&#8221; rather, a<br>question to the general public regarding honor and morality left in the game today. How<br>do we see ourselves in the game today? How will we be tomorrow? Do we see ourselves<br>as being the best of the best and allowed to trample over those who are not as &#8220;uber?&#8221;<br>Or are we honorable beings? These things and more I am curious to hear about. I want<br>to know, WHAT drives players to drop all respect, morality, and integrity, to obtain one<br>piece of loot. Moreover, what of honor? </blockquote><br> <p><br> Words we should all concider...even though i thought she was in DOA, a fennin "uber" guild )<br>. Then again,whos to say how i or you should spend our EQ time. If i choose to be a Uber player in an uber guild railroading the weak ...whos to say i cant...after all i pay the same monthly fee.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ok so like this person wakes up and says to herself " How can i try to do something good and manage to piss off 80+ guilds in EQ on 10+ servers ???" Hehe well im here to tell ya she did it.<br><br><br><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/uanastia.showPublicProfile?language=EN">Anastia</a> of Erolissi Marr ( that Uber server,hehe), made some wierd flim flam post called Uberscore. Now in this she listed the overall Uber guild and so on for every server and then the over all uber guilds 100 list. Its funny and her methods were pretty retarded ) She went into it with a great idea and instead of getting the data she needed she jumped in with a guesstimate approach... now i find <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showMessage?topicID=5015.topic">THIS</a> very funny. Kudos for making me smile, cause i love how she did manage to piss off 90 guilds at least in EQ ) MAN i wish i had thought of<a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showMessage?topicID=5015.topic"> this.....</a><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still kicking around in DAoC its fun. Got a few issues, i cant stand the distances you have to run to recover your gravesite or the amount of EXP you loose at level 10 ( its comperable to the same amount lost at level 30 in EQ with near the same recovery time)but i do like the game and my wifes in love with it )<br><br><br> A friends website had this posted...its funny.<br> <p><br><blockquote>This is the transcript of the ACTUAL radio conversation of a US naval ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland in October 1995. Radio conversation released by the Chief of Naval Operations 10-10-95.<br><br><br>Canadians: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the South to avoid a collision.<br><br><br>Americans: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the North to avoid a collision.<br><br><br>Canadians: Negative. You will have to divert your course 15 degrees to the South to avoid a collision.<br><br><br>Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.<br><br><br>Canadians: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.<br><br><br>Americans: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH, I SAY AGAIN, THAT'S ONE FIVE DEGREES NORTH, OR COUNTER-MEASURES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.<br><br><br>Canadians: This is a lighthouse. Your call<br><p><br> hehe . I hope you got as big a kick out of that as me )<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've heard about this expansion for months and they finally announce it. Supposedly its going to have a new engine, race, class, and planet (Norraths moon). From what I hear he name is supposed to be 'EverQuest: Shadow of Luclin' and the site is at www.everquest.com/luclin/ . Well this new expansion will suck, why? because there's been 2 expansions and they are just going to make you pay more money to buy another. The only thing in this expansion I look forward to is the engine, finalfuckinly they are going to make the graphics look better as well as enhance player models. Anyways, knowing me I'm going to find more information for you guys to munch on =).  (PS: this is my first post) Look forward to some interesting things >=).<br><br><br> Please send all emails to <mailto:tel0net@trifocus.net>Tel0net   tel0net@trifocus.net <br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Easter bunny put some wierd things in my basket. Some were labeled EQ2 DEV notes. Wierd huh. Im sure its a hoax (snicker) But who knows. Ill read thru and tell ya what i see. A sample of what i read in there follows.<br><p><br><blockquote><i> ....EverQuest 2 will be a sequel to EQ1 in flavor and functionality.  We will attempt to expand the depth and scope of the game while we insure the flavor of the title will not change.  We will learn from all of EQ 2&#8217;s predecessors to avoid design pitfalls and give use the flexibility to tweak and tune all aspects of systems to assist in combating new issues that arrive.  We will tune the game for PVP over 200 levels and ship with a PVE emphasis with 50 levels. ...<br><p><br> .....<br>In Everquest 2 players will have the ability to buy and build up property. We determined that players could buy and upgrade three basic types of structures: residential (homes), commercial (shops), and industrial (forges, bakeries, etc.). We will set the locations in which the players can build these properties as predefined zones.  This will allow the areas in which players own property to maintain the look and feel of Everquest. Also, in this manner, cities will develop over time and even new player owned and run cities can be generated. The amount of property one can own will be hard capped to avoid cluttering and an upkeep cost will be associated on all property based on how valuable it is. All of these features will work towards keeping players more attached to the world while giving us the controls necessary to make it look great...</i></blockquote><br><p><br> Sound like BS ? who knows...lets ride this monkey.....more to come<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ok so a friend messages me and says hes got DAoC and i can play it ....er....i mean my wife can play it. SO i junp in and D/L from the slowest server Mythic could find for the patcher.Then i log in,view the keyboard layout and start a character.We start with a female Brit, my wifes char. I figure out how to target and attack and loot items. Woman of mine figures out how to sell items  SHEESH i admit i was stumped there for a bit. She accidently tried to buy something abd when the icon popped up she figured it out.<br><br><br> Ok so now we got the basics. Then came the part on how to figure out whats safe to kill. Colors are similiar to EQ  Red/Orange/Yellow/Blue/White/Green for how hard they are in relation to your level.<br><br> <br> I talk my wife into going to bed and BOOYAH ! Im in there. Troll Viking ( sounds wierd i know) . Was really easy to play and figure out. Cool graphics on the race. Leveled to 6th in a few hours,became a beserker and liked the effect )<br><br><br> DAoC, in my oppinion on my 1st night, has issue to deal with as one would expect. The connection is fairly laggy around structures. The fact that anything you buy from a vendor is told to everyone within ear shot :). And a few other things. I like thier monsters and the designe on them. I like the races/classes so far. I LOVE my troll.<br><br><br> DAoC needs to add a few filters wich im sure will happen. Over all i think this game is MORE than on Par with EQ. The graphics base on monsters are the same to me, the settings are graphicly close (EQ's are a bit sharper) and the login screen is cooler on DAoC .<br><br><br> I said it before now ill emphasize it. THANK GOD DAoC is around the corner cause you people out there are gonna love it.EQ would be a contender for its up and comming expansion except we all know it will be the same crappy customer service/GMs no matter what expansion.<br><br><br> Reason im moving to DAoC ? It looks great, seems to be designed with RPers in mind not Grief 133t boys like SB does. And because im tired of playing a game i really like only to see its piss poof employees messing it up ( EQ) So im GREATFUL to Tel0net for his help and so is my wife. <br>
