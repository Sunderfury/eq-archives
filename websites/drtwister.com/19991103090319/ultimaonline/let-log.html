 FACE="Arial"> Senith said Anybody here know why TC just hit the
dirt again? &lt;-- because its tc</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
TC is up more often than Atlantic, IronWill. So HA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> i hate both servers so it doesnt matter to me (*)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
Why do you hate TC, IronWill?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> face it anyone who plays on test center and then
actually gets upset and write in letters wondering why it went
down is a phr34k and there are lots on tc</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
I'm not upset. I'm curious.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> &quot;WHY DID IT GO DOWN YOU SOB&quot; uh TEST
center</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
Usually a crash equals new coding or testing. So I'm seeing if
can get the scoop.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> i wish we would wipe it every day; that would rule
(*)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
Well, coming from someone who plays on TC...a wipe everyday would
make it unable to be used for testing. So it would be obsolete.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> well the point of test center isnt for players
(ever) and thats the biggest misconception...its for QA; we are
just nice enough to allow them on (*)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
So's the rumor, IronWill. But there are a lot of elite players
exclusive to TC that do a lot of testing with the PDs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> thats where someone is f*cked up in PD - there
should be no &quot;elite&quot; players at all; either set up a
system where everyone can help or none at all</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
I mean elite as in &quot;old and experienced&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> i dont think its good either - the previous meaning
of elite fits much better</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
No, someone who enjoys crashing events and pking is only good
for certain testing...someone who is multi-skilled with many different
aspects of the game is more useful for testing. You disagree?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> the very fact that PD would rather go to COB than
to its own GMs is enough proof that there is a very small clique</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
The people I'm speaking about never use COB.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> luckily our new online manager thinks like me (*)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
I think its amusing you're cracking at people who TEST FOR FREE.
You should be thanking them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> why when they are way more trouble than they are
worth and i mean that (*); no one at osi should have &quot;friends&quot;
that they put all their stock in</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
Whoa, slow down. I never said anyone got anything...I said people
tested, not got rewarded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> when 100 people mail us or call us on test center
going down opposed to maybe 2 small bugs getting reported that
would be caught by QA anyway, you are talking a lot of money in
taking care of those issues when that money and time can be better
spent; and god bless src dracor for what he does but the counselor
program on tc was a cluster()</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
Well, funny, I found a break-in bug yesterday that the QAs missed,
reported it, and it STILL hasn't been fixed. So I don't see where
you're coming from.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> nothing happens overnight</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
No, I'm saying that players DO catch problems. You're acting like
player-testing is valueless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> thats right (*)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
&quot;Too much trouble&quot;?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> the bug you described was caught last week by testers
at osi and was put into our bug tracking system to be fixed</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
Then I guess I'll just keep my bugs to myself that I find, exploit
the hell out of them, and go on my merry way, since I'm &quot;too
much trouble&quot; to be listened to.Funny...that's not what Tree
and Kal said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> no offense to tree or kal but they do not know
a lot what goes on i dont think its important for everyone to
know everything at any given time no esp given the history of
osi leaks; that doesnt demean your efforts, but what you are asking
requires support for something that is already being done anyway</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
What did I ask? I said wiping everyday, for no reason whatsoever,
would make testing by players on TC impossible. And you're saying
good?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> you want players to be able to report bugs - we
would have to have people go through the bug list, go through
the checklist, check it out, report it, and have osmeone fix it</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
And you would prefer they keep it to themselves, and wait for
a QA to find it?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> when i hear a bug like what you said, i send it
to a guy at osi that i know will test it immediately; he also
knows i wont fill him full of sh*t</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
And yet I might?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> now at the same time they are testing all day long;
no i didnt say you would - had i not heard of what you talked
about i would have done the same</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
And yet they still don't know how to hop a tower roof, or how
to mark in mid-air.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> the point is it was already known</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
So then your suggestion is to not bother testing?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> in my honest opinion no one should be allowed on
test center until after a patch has been completed and tested;
then you can get on there and test away to see whats up (*)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">Senith&gt;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
So you're saying I shouldn't bother?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">IronWill&gt;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> there are some people find bugs on tc so they can
