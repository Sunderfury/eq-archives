 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Before the meeting begins,
Rich Vogel, Producer of UO, would like to make a few comments.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RVogel&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Hello everyone <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RVogel&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I would like to make
a comment on the exploit programs that people are using in UO
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RVogel&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> If people find exploits
they should tell us and NOT post them to everyone <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RVogel&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> This causes us to work
overtime and move our current priorities around to fix them <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RVogel&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> If we find out really
bad exploits, we will take quick action and fix them <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RVogel&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> We have a lot of new
and exiting changes coming up and we want to make sure we spend
our time working on improving UO and Not chasing these exploits
caused by third party programs <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RVogel&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> In the coming months
we will work hard to improve our client/server encryption to stop
these 3rd party exploit programs <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RVogel&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I am confident you will
see some really good progress on this in the next few months <BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#999900" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mean while, in
a private chat, I decided to say 'Hi!' to DesignerDragon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Heh, you realize Dupre(RVogel)
means YOU :)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I think so. And. do you
think it will stop? I mean, come on, I understand you guys work
extremely hard, and I love this game, but you don't listen to
the players.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Heh. Name ANY game where
the players have been listened to more.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> The fact is that nothing
you post has anything to do with &quot;listening to the players&quot;
and if you think it does you're deluding yourself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> That is true, BUT, this
is also the first game of its magnitude.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> It all has to do with
ways to advance and get ahead without playing fair, usually by
hurting other players.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Now now, I don't think
so. It's about making a statement. That's what it has always been
about</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I would also have to
say, that it is the work that I am doing, that has actually helped
in the further development of this game.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> If it were about making
a statement, you could do it without posting bugs and exploits.
I can think of a halfdozen ways to do it right off the bat. I'm
sure you can too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Hate to break it to you,
but it usually slows development :P</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Yes, I can think of several.
But before I went public, I was never listened to. So I guess
I am serving some point.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Instead of being listened
to now, you're being reviled instead. You're kind of akin to terrorists
who blow things up to attract attention to their cause. Why not
run a helpful bug database like the UO Bug Base?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I am only looked down
on by OSI and the Development team. The players, look upon me
as a helper. I help both sides, the exploiters and the people
who try to protect themselves from the exploiters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Hate to break it to you,
but your perspective is badly skewed by the fact that you only
TALK to exploiters. The majority of regular players would be much
happier if you didn't post at all. The &quot;protection&quot;
argument generally doesn't wash</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Hehe, that's what I tell
them, but they swear they are only reading the site for educational
purposes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Suuuure they are.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I agree with you on that,
they wouldn't be at my site, if they didn't want to exploit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I truly believe that
bugs that unbalance game play should be fixed asap. But what about
bugs that have been around for months, somtimes easier to fix
than a major problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> It depends on what priority
they get set at. We typically tackle in priroity order, every
update.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> and priority is set upon
how much it will outway game balance...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> it's based on game balance,
how many calls it generates for GMs (because that also causes
real poroblems, it costs more $ and it also makes getting help
slower for everyone else)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Also on difficulty, too.
If we can tackle five immediate priority things &amp; we have
a fixed deadline, or we can tackle just one, we'll do the five.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I do appreciate you speaking
with me, and if you don't mind, I want to make a statement on
3rd Party programs...UOE/UOP.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> hm?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> I do not like the 'exploitable'
features of these programs, they are unbalanced. But a basic feature,
like last target should be available in normal game play. Your
standard magic casting monster does it. If you are running away,
they will still hit you. Yet without a last target, if a monster/player
is running away, you often will misclick.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DD&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">last target and target self and a few
others will be aded to the client for sure</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> And the only other major
concern you have though would be the unequiping and equiping of
weapons while casting or walking, etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Thank you for chating,
and I would love to speak any time. Take care, and hope your daughter
is feeling well.<BR>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It was nice to
speak with DD, and I hope to speak with him again soon. We actually
got some good information about the process they go through to
fix bugs. Also, last target is coming to UO. When? He didn't say
which is usually the situation, but if it will stop the use of
3rd party usage, maybe it will get here quicker. Would love to
hear your comments, so please feel free to </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"
