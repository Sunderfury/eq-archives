</FONT></B>Hey guys I just wanted to say a little something before
everyone took off... <BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>Basically the other night some thigns were brought
out of the cousnelor IRC room that I said which were most inappropriate,
unprofessional, and to be honest uncharacteristic of me in general.
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>I would like to post the apology that I did send around
and I would like you to know that I am sincere in this apology.
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>last night there were things said regarding Test Center
that were possibly the most inappropriate things I have said in
my tenure here as a Game Master on Ultima Online for Origin. There
were some things that were said that basically unacceptable from
anyone made by a team member of UO, especially one who works in
a sort of public eye. <BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>Firstly I was basically unknowledgeable and naive about
a certain segment of the population which is that which resides
on Test Center. Being as it is a larger portion of the UO that
I had thought, I belittled them unfairly and inappropriately <BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>I was also unaware of the large contribution that this
team makes to UO in general. In my ignorance I made bland and
asinine comments about them. <BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>Secondly I went out on a limb and spoke my mind about
something that I should not even have an opinion about. Coming
publicly and assaulting something with my thoughts is dead wrong,
especially when that something is actually doing a damn good job.
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>Finally I made other remarks about some coworkers that
is truly unprofessional and unacceptable. For this I apologize
publicly and hope that they understand that the things said in
the heat of the moment. <BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>. I do not and up to last night have not vented - I
chose the absolute wrong place and forum to do so and attacked
people for basically no reason at all. <BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>I take full responsibility for what was said last night,
and have learned a couple of valuable things along the way. For
any of you that I have offended out there I offer my full and
total apologies - such action is neither acceptable my OSI, the
UO team, or even me personally <BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>I am quite embarrassed with myself to be honest, but
can only go from here and learn from experience. <BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#6599ff">IronWill -</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">
</FONT></B>Thank you all for your time and deepest apologies,
<BR>
