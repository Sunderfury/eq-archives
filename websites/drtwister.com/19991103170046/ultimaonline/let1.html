<p><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Eras Demi ITC">The Horrah...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here I am - a
Long Time RP Guild Leader cavorting with the likes of<BR>
a bug publisher. Why? Because you have a mature and vested interest<BR>
in the game that myself and 28 real - life friends have played
for<BR>
over a year (6 in UO Beta as well).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What you do, and
the way you do it - is what makes your site<BR>
required reading. You seem to be an adult, respectful person -
who<BR>
enjoys the fun and responsibility of publishing the shortcomings
of a<BR>
game we love - in hopes that they provide amusement, protection
from<BR>
the bug/exploit, or even encourage hope for change from the company<BR>
who sells the product to its customers each month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There were other
sites that advocated cheating, lying, and screwing<BR>
your neighbor before he screws you. Some sites delved into kewlism
-<BR>
others used to resort to racism. Yours seems to have the &quot;Beware
of<BR>
this, Have fun with this, or hope it gets fixed soon&quot; approach
- which<BR>
is quite refreshing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I read your log
with DD from the UOHOC chat and I first looked at it<BR>
very pessimistically - but I quickly had to change my opinion.
You<BR>
were polite, knowledgeable, brazen, and seemed to have the best<BR>
interests of the UO *player* in mind. If your words did not make
a<BR>
difference to DD, then his mass generalizations about who reads
your<BR>
site mean he has lost sight of the players - the members - the<BR>
customers - who operate communities in UO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I read your site
for protection and amusement. If you don't believe<BR>
me, I'm sorry - you cannot accept the truth. Our Guild has been<BR>
screwed over by &quot;juiced up&quot; (by GM's) PK'rs, &quot;jacked&quot;
by<BR>
cheaters/exploiters, and trivialized by a broken economy. We still<BR>
refuse to cheat - except for that notorious 3rd party program
UOCurse!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Yep, we're the
clowns with the 'thees' and 'thous'. We actually try<BR>
to RP. Pity us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We have 126 characters
either as Guild members - or associates of<BR>
the Guild. Zero are PK's. Four are MPK's. One guy tried UO Assist,<BR>
his trial period ran out. About a third of our group 'disapproves'
of<BR>
others visiting Dr Twister's site. They are the same people that
say<BR>
&quot;we have to do something about combatting this bug!&quot;
when we tell them<BR>
about something we learn here. We are a league of Merchants, not<BR>
neccessarily fighters, and we die daily due to inneffective, buggy<BR>
programming by OSI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Basically - you
listen, and OSI customer support doesn't listen<BR>
until they read your site. You present problems in the game and
OSI<BR>
fixes them. Players send bugs to OSI and never hear back - or
get<BR>
canned spam email back. The UO economy is nearly in ruins because
of<BR>
typographical or logic errors. While OSI Development prefers to
do<BR>
massive revisions in trades, fighting, reputation, housing, or
other<BR>
skills, the players suffer because of exploits and small, seemingly<BR>
too-insignificant-to-fix problems. You help get these fixed. Carry
on! <BR>

keep it professional, keep it fun -</FONT></P>
