<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">One of the major
things I would like to do over the next few weeks is to <BR>
take an accurate pulse of the feelings of the UO Community. You
guys <BR>
make up one of the most remarkable groups that exist on the net,
<BR>
spanning a number of different websites, usenet groups, and even
<BR>
different games. I spent a couple of days trying to get a good
grasp of <BR>
the issues that are on the various bulletin boards last week,
and I <BR>
found I didn't have the bandwidth to get it all down. But I want
to know <BR>
what you think. I need to know what you think. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For those of you
who haven't had any contact with me yet, my name is <BR>
Carly Staehlin-Taylor (aka LadyMOI), and I'm the Online Community
<BR>
Manager (aka Minister of Information) for Lord British Productions
at <BR>
OSI. I initiated my work here with the Ascension team, and have
since <BR>
begun to migrate more attention over to the UO team. We've got
a <BR>
definite need for better communication right now, and I want to
help <BR>
make that happen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What I'm looking
for is for anyone who'd like to help me in this <BR>
endeavor. There's a *lot* of discussion about UO out there...
on the <BR>
web, on usenet, on irc, even in the game. It's impossible for
me to keep <BR>
an eye on it all, that's where you come in. If you would be willing
to <BR>
monitor these boards, and send me little updates about the hot
topics, <BR>
as well as a summary of what the players are saying (likes, dislikes)
<BR>
along with representative quotes taken from those boards, you
would be <BR>
doing me a great favor. Once I get them, I'll be synthesizing
these <BR>
reports into one that will be delivered on a weekly basis to not
only <BR>
the development team, but also to the management team here at
OSI. It is <BR>
my hope that we'll be better able to understand your needs, concerns,
<BR>
likes, and dislikes as a result. That can only be good for everyone
involved. <BR>
This isn't to indicate that the developers will stop showing up
on the <BR>
boards. In fact, I'd like to encourage more of that. But these
reports <BR>
that you send me can be used to help focus our attention on the
issues <BR>
that you, the players, think are important. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once I get an
indication of how many of you would be interested in <BR>
helping me out in this way, I'll try to develop a structure that
makes <BR>
sure that none of you have to do work that someone else is doing.
If we <BR>
get enough interest, we can get blanket coverage of all the boards,
and <BR>
create accurate pictures of the feelings and attitudes that exist.
<BR>
Initially, I would like to ask that you just start doing these
and I'll <BR>
use what I get. If the interest is very great, I'll spend some
time <BR>
creating a structure for us to work within. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you are interested,
please begin creating these summaries and send <BR>
them to me directly at </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A

 COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> with the subject heading:
<BR>
Community Report, , . I will be looking forward to working with
anyone <BR>
willing to help in this project. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thanks so much,
</FONT></P>
