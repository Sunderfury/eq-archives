<p><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">City under
Siege </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">by

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Well, I didn't
really know where else to put this so I thought i would put it
here. Imagine an event, an OSI event of massive proportions. A
GM dressed in a black robe robe would lead a massive army of the
undead to lay siege to the city of Trinsic. The GM would be stripped
of most of his powers, perhaps the ability to kill a single player
once every 24 hours just by pointing at him. (Or something equally
interesting :) He'd have otherwise virtually the same statistics
as your average Lich Lord. He would ride atop a nightmare and
sit at the back of the vandguard of his army, watching as his
minions cut down warrior after warrior.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Town Cryers
would not be alerted for this event. The main force of the undead
army would consist of zombies, skeletons and ghouls with a medium
sized contingent of skeleton knights and lichs to reinforce their
weaker siblings. This would not be a small disorganized army like
previous events where players in mass flocked to the event site
and massacred the monsters. It would not be hundreds of undead,
but thousands! As soon as the undead begain their siege of Trinsic
the city guards would be turned off and a magical barrier would
encase Trinsic, preventing recalling into the town as well as
gates. Teleport would not function either. You could still recall
out if you wished but you could not gain access to the town by
magical means. Banks and Inns would no longer function. Those
inside would be the only hope for defending Trinsic and it's citizens
once the attack begins upon the city. Hopefully they can unite
and make a stand against the onslaught that is sure to come..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The undead would
pour through the West and South gates, slamming into the hastily
organized wall of warriors encased in plate, chain and ringmail.
Atop the arch of the West gate archers would be raining down arrows
upon the hordes of undead while alchemists hurled explosive potions
into their ranks. Meanwhile in the street below, the zombies would
be ripping the flesh from the wall of warriors that has been assembled
to block the horde from gaining open ground and bursting through
into the city. The warriors themselves were not without their
own victories, far from it. They too were cutting down their fair
share of the undead, one after another until it looked like the
corpses of the dead could go no higher and still more of the rotting
corpses slumbered forward, a strange blackness visible inside
their hollow eye sockets. Warriors fell on the side of light but
the healers stood somber behind the great wall of iron and steel
warriors, bandaging the wounded and providing what aid they could.
The few great mages stood even further back from the frontlines
whispering their words of power that sent great fireballs streaking
at the undead, lightining bolts struck down from the heavens and
some even summoning great elementals from the very cobblestone
of the streets and from the streams that flowed through Trinsic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If the defenders
lose this battle, and there would be few of them because of the
surprising nature of the event, the undead as well as the Shadowlord
GM would occupy the town. As soon as they reached the center of
the town, all remaining NPC's would be instantly slaughtered and
would not regenerate. The brownish sand color stone of the town
would twist into a tainted black (A small client patch would be
needed before hand with no explanation of it's purpose of course.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Shadowlord
would erect a small, powerful obelisk in the center of town to
maintain the decayed state of the city as well as the magical
barrier that prevented entrance to the city by magical means.
The Shadowlord would be linked directly to this artifact, if he
perishes, the artifact shatters and everything reverts to normal.
He would sit on his throne near the artifact and direct the defense
of the city. (It would always be a human GM, 24 hours a day, 7
days a week. They could just cycle the GM's every 3 or 6 hour
periods). All entrances into the city would be heavily defended
by the undead as well as a sizeable force of Lich lords to guard
the Shadowlord and the artifact. Patrols of undead would frequent
the city streets to mop up any wannabe heroes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In essence, the
city of Trinsic could be considered lost. For the first time in
UO, people would feel a real loss. The loss of an entire city.
Murderer and Great Lord would set aside their differences and
unite to fight a common foe and restore their beautiful city...or
would they? Perhaps the Shadowlord has other plans and invites
the criminals and murderers of the land to share his haven and
help defend it from the armies of light. An entire shard would
be split into two factions. That would be rather interesting I
think. Anything is possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It would create
a unique scenario and for once, present us with a tangible fore
and an achievable goal. Something that was sorely lacking in other
events. The beaten and battered defenders would retreat into the
forests surrounding Trinsic to regroup and organize their counterstrike.
(Warriors of Free Trinsic? :) Warriors, mages, smiths, alchemists,
assassins and healers would come from all corners of Britannia
bringing supplies and offers of their services to free the great
city of Trinsic. You could extent the magical barrier for a good
pace so that people would have to travel on foot to Trinsic to
help out, or even block recall in the entire world until the artifact
was shattered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">That's more or
less a brief summary on the idea, I've been tossing it back and
forth for a good year now adding to it and refining it a bit.
It'll never happen but I figured some of you might be interested
in hearing it :) <BR>
