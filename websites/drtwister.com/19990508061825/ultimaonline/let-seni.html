<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">Goodbye</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Posted by James, aka Senith on April 07,
1999 at 13:57:25:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I'd like to say thank you to everyone who's
been by my side the past few months. And I would like to apologize
to anyone who thinks I'm &quot;bailing out&quot;...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But I'm not. I've lost faith in a lot of
folks on the Support Team, due to their reactions to the incident
and the actual conversation that sparked it. How people can ignore
the comments made and villify me for letting the public know what
was said is beyond me...but I desecrated one of their idols, and
I guess people want to believe in something.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">So I'm quitting. The Counselor program is
no longer a viable place for me to exist; it is unpleasant to
work with folks who PM me with death threats and insults. I lost
my shot at Seership, due to my sponsor pulling out after the incident,
even though I had the support of a very large player base.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">And then there is OSI. My posts have ALWAYS
been polite, save the Iron Will conversation. I have never directly
attacked Origin, and have always respected their efforts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">But I'm leaving. And I have nothing left
to hide. So here are my opinions; take them as you will...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Necromancy was never intended to work; it
was thrown together quickly to keep players from switching to
EQ. Is this an opinion without actual proof? Yes and no. I have
plenty of circumstantial evidence; the release date of testing
being right before the release of EQ, the pulling of testing right
after, the odd coming of Evil/Good BEFORE necromancy was perfected,
and the return to the drawing board. If this isn't enough...then
someone else should explain it to the customers. Everyone WANTED
necromancy...what is the Evil/Good nonsense for when something
else was already on the table that the people wanted?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It is my opinion Test Center and Abyss serve
as places for players to do QA work without getting paid. OSI
knows that players will report what they find, or exploit them
religiously until it becomes known...so they enlist the help of
hundreds of people to test their patches without rewarding or
paying them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The funny thing is...these people are PAYING
to test. Their $10.00 a month is going towards TESTING for OSI.
Does that seem a little askew to you?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">And the same goes for Customer Support.
They don't have enough staff to do the job....so they bait people
with the fancy blue robes, the &quot;respect&quot; that comes
with it (unless you count the 80,000 people that constantly say
&quot;he's just a Counselor; he can't do anything&quot;), and
the &quot;abilities&quot;. Look at that; a couple hundred UNPAID
support staff. And what is the reward for this?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Nothing. Nada. Wow, you can get an item
on your paper doll. Oooh, you can talk to the GMs. And? The GMs
don't tell you anything you don't already know, and the items
on your paper doll are pointless, considering the Counselor character
is unable to do anything save answer questions and serve at &quot;weddings&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">And now they want to add new powers, like
squelch and jail. Funny, this will cut the GM queue in half, and
allow yet more responsibility and work to fall onto the shoulders
of UNPAID and UNREWARDED volunteers. Does THIS seem wrong to you
at all?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Anyone offended by the statement above?
If you are, then you are beginning to recognize there is some
truth in it, and you are just fighting the realization. Think
about what I wrote above before you dismiss it as nonsense....REALLY
think about it...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I'd like to thank everyone who donated to
the tower fund, and hope you all make use of it. With the wipe
coming, it won't matter soon...but I hope it serves as inspiration
for others to build something similar in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Don't follow anyone blindly...strike out
your own path. And NEVER back down from your words, or hide behind
a false name; I may have caused myself a lot of problems by posting
with my Counselor name, but it brought me to a lot of realizations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">What will I do with my time now? I'm quitting
my night job, and signing on as manager full-time at Decanter
Fine Wines, a wine shoppe in suburban Columbia. I'll be taking
Tang Soo Do again, and see if I can finally put together a few
songs in my little home studio I've built up. I'll be turning
my computers into servers for Hotline (check out www.hotlinesw.com),
so if you know what that is, or find out later, check me out at
the Phantom Server on the tracker: tracked.group.org. And I'm
getting involved with a Matrix fan club (yes, the movie was that
frickin' good). Will I play EQ? I don't think so...it doesn't
interest me that much.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The only things I will miss are the people,
and my position at Stratics. Being a reporter allowed me to throw
some words around and write some okay stuff; it seemed to be appreciated
by the few that read it, and my superiors seemed pleased. I hope
someone applies at Stratics for my position when I'm gone...it's
a good gig, and the folks there are real nice (especially Beans).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I'll be conjuring up a final post, about
the opening of the Arcadium and my leaving...so if you want to
stop by, feel free. It should be up by tomorrow morning, if nothing
odd happens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Well, that's it. I'll reply to a few comments
in the thread, but I'm not going overboard. Anyone who knows me
well enough can ICQ me or e-mail...I'll be here...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">My accounts have been handed over to my
fiance's little brother. So you may see Nessos running around,
but Senith has been deleted, and all the items transferred to
someone who will manage them responsibly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">And does it matter? It's all disappearing
in a week anyway, and I'll be forgotten soon after...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I wish you all the best of luck! And dammit,
get out from in front of that computer and go ride a bike!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">-James, aka Senith</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">P.S. If someone from the Support Team is
reading this, it's been 3 days since I e-mailed Kal and still
no response. So I assume this is a &quot;we don't want you back&quot;
response. And if someone from Stratics is reading this...you'll
get my official resignation shortly, along with my final post.</FONT></P>
