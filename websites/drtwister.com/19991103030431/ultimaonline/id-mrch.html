<p><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Proposal for
Merchant Economy  </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">by
- RLSteeves</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hail Good Fellow,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">     I would like
to submit the following ideas for consideration based<BR>
on practicality and building the merchant economy and other issues.
 In<BR>
making the following requests I have tried to examine both sides
of the<BR>
coin as far as possible uses good and bad.. Now that in UO you
seem to<BR>
want to keep a balance between PKs and the average player I feel
there<BR>
are some real nice ideas to enhance the game and most do not required<BR>
new artwork .Please review the following..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">1) Make Cooking
Kettles like the one that spawn craftable items.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Criteria:<BR>
They are made as an item and not a deed<BR>
They can be placed in any location and do not allow blocking (you
can<BR>
walk through it)<BR>
Minimum skil required to make 65 Smithing  40 Lumberjacking (for
the<BR>
fire logs)<BR>
Materials required 125 Ingots and 10 logs<BR>
Weight 12 stones<BR>
Pros:<BR>
They could be carried and when meat is found the person would
be able to<BR>
cook the meat.<BR>
Nice decoration<BR>
Another item that merchants could sell and smithies could make.<BR>
No new artwork</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Cons:<BR>
Would make a nice trap scenario.  Place one of them for effect
and a few<BR>
regular chest with items in them. Then pace a Trapped chest in
the<BR>
bunch..  Now that&#146;s mean :)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">2) Make Braziers
craftable</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Criteria:<BR>
Make item as a deed that wil remain in place until all charges
are used.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When item is made
it will have a set number of charges from a random<BR>
list of  possible spells.<BR>
It will not be able to block movement of players or creatures<BR>
Minimum skill required to make 65 smithing  85 magery<BR>
Materials required 100 ingots 25 sets of reagents for the appropriate<BR>
spell that will be cast on the brazier (random)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">  Pros:<BR>
Great decoration.<BR>
Help to build merchant trade<BR>
Could be used while in high spawn area if spell is useful.<BR>
No new artwork<BR>
A continual supply would be needed<BR>
Economy would be enhanced</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Cons:<BR>
Ruthless would have access to 25 spells (proposed number of spells)<BR>
without using mana but so would their victim</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">3)  Make rescue
runes or scrolls available</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Criteria:<BR>
Could be sold by Healers or made by Mages by casting recall on
an<BR>
unmarked rune stone<BR>
They would be for one use only and destroyed upon use.<BR>
When made they would pick a random Healers shop and recall the
user or<BR>
his target to a random healers location in a town guarded zone.<BR>
Selling price 75gp<BR>
Not considered an aggressive spell<BR>
Newbie type item non stealable or lootable<BR>
No magic ability required to use</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Pros:<BR>
Ghosts would be able to get to a healer.<BR>
A quick escape from Pks for newbies<BR>
Target a Red Pk and send him into a town zone : )<BR>
None could be waiting to ambush the sendee as the location they
recal to<BR>
is random<BR>
Gives Mage and item to craft and sell</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Cons:<BR>
They could be used to thin down a large crowd if you wanted to
attack<BR>
one player or monster</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">4) Secure Metal
Chests Craftable</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Materials 75 ingots
10 cloth (lining)<BR>
Skills required 50 smithing 30 tailoring<BR>
Made in form of deed to be placed<BR>
Only one allowed per character<BR>
Accessible by placer ONLY<BR>
Deteriorates like a house<BR>
Refreshed like a house<BR>
Unable to block movement of characters or creatures<BR>
Able to be redeeded<BR>
Sold at shops for 750gp (a small goal for a newbie to reach)<BR>
Able to be placed in town limits but not near any dwellings (same
space<BR>
limit as with a small house)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Pros:<BR>
Would give a newbie a way to at least store his items until he
could<BR>
make friends or own a house.<BR>
Would solve the new mining dilemma (colored ore and Pks killing
miners<BR>
to get what they can not. The need for the colored ore has created
a<BR>
monster)<BR>
Yet another item to build marketable item inventory<BR>
Same weight limits as all other chests</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Cons:<BR>
Could be used along with cooking kettle in the trapped chest scenario<BR>
Looters would have a place to store 400 stones of goods without
having<BR>
worry about what they could carry. Come back later and get items
inside.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">5) Make colored
leather armor craftable</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Criteria:<BR>
Skills required would be the minimum for each piece as already
exists<BR>
plus an additional 5 points to be able to dye it</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Pros:<BR>
A nice addition to the tailoring trade<BR>
Items would be more in demand in the market place<BR>
Help to build the Tailoring trade economy</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Cons:<BR>
None I can see at this point</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">6)  Fur Coats
craftable and required in cold areas</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Criteria:<BR>
They would be required wear in all areas where snow or ice might
be<BR>
found<BR>
Not wearing on would result in large amounts of stamina loss and
small<BR>
amounts of strength loss<BR>
They could be made from furs as found on the used to be fur bearing<BR>
animals<BR>
Minimum skill required to make them 75 tailoring or 80 to dye
them as<BR>
well<BR>
The higher the skill the better the protection from the cold<BR>
Weight 10 stones<BR>
Materials 15 furs</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Pros:<BR>
Again building the tailoring trade<BR>
A more realistic approach to fur bearing animals<BR>
More items to add to the economy more money turned over<BR>
A more realistic approach to cold weather climates</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Cons:<BR>
New artwork?<BR>
Less you can carry</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">7)  (Now for the
good one)  Stone Throwing Catapults Craftable</FONT></P>

Deteriorates after 2 hours from time it was set<BR>
Can not be moved once set<BR>
Fires exploding metal balls  , flame sacks , stone balls(new items<BR>
craftable see below)<BR>
When fired a targeting cursor appears and damage is dealt in a
circular<BR>
pattern outward to 4 tiles either in all directions. 100 at center
down<BR>
to 25 percent on the outer edges ( Something simialr to earthquake
or an<BR>
expanded flamestrike)<BR>
If a player is targeted it will through the metal ball about 2
screens<BR>
away before it falls to the ground same with a monster<BR>
Can not be rapid fired 1 minute timer<BR>
Pros:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Great for castle
or home defense<BR>
Another item to be crafted and sold<BR>
They disappear after 2 hours of being setup<BR>
Great for guild wars</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Cons:<BR>
Not good for close range as you take damage if in the target zone<BR>
Massive amounts of damage dealt 80hps at center down to 20 at
edges with<BR>
metal balls or 60 at center and 15 on edges with flame sacks<BR>
