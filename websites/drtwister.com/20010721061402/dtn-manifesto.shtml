<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#BB0000"><a name="beginning"></a>In the Beginning...</font></b><br>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I began my crusade with Ultima Online.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ultima Online laid before us an experience that was unlike any other. It was full of promise. &quot;This is what I have been waiting for!&quot; we all said to ourselves in unison. But the promise was never fulfilled. We all got a glimpse of what could be, and that's all we ever got.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Origin Systems promised us a dynamic economy. They promised us in-game ethics. They promised us life cycles and dragons that would attack the town when the players had been too voracious and they promised 24/7 connectivity with full customer support.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">None of it happened. We had players stab other players in the back. We had players allowed back into town - absolved of their murderous ways by simply peeking into each other's bags and resetting their &quot;karma&quot;. We had players bankrupting the economy by creating skullcap after skullcap and looting all of the available currency. We had mighty players fall by the humblest of spells and others getting poisoned by the act of shooting arrows into the venomous snakes that were clear across the screen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nothing was done about it. Yet OSI still continued to accept our money. We paid to beta test their buggy game and a year into the experience, things were still laughably broken. You can read my original manifesto <a href="/archives/dtn-manifesto1098.shtml">here</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Months and years later, we were promised new expansions and editions. In an incredibly cynical maneuver, we were promised necromancy when UO was faced with the threat of EQ hitting the market. Does UO3D have necromancy now?</font></p>
                              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
                                our social contract affirms that we live in a 
                                meritocracy - whereby the best and the brightest 
                                attain the highest levels of success, fame, and 
                                respect - then those who are both incompetent 
                                and unethical deserve to be at the lowest steps 
                                of the social ladder. Why EA/OSI is getting their 
                                act together at this late date is beyond me, but 
                                it does demonstrate that while the millstone of 
                                justice might grind slowly, it grinds with inevitability.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you well know, I am a different breed. There are others, like me, who walk this line, but we are few. We know your pain because we have lived it. We know your dissatisfaction because we have experienced it. We want your justice, so we do something about it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most feel unable to do anything against these big game companies. Some don't care. Some don't know. Dissatisfaction with your gaming experience is not something to be taken lightly. Not only do you dedicate your $10.00 a month to your leisurely pursuit, but also you dedicate your time. Hours upon hours each week, this is time that you will never get back. </font></p>
                              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                                could be going to the movies, going bowling, going 
                                to nightclubs, hanging out with friends, swimming, 
                                riding skateboards, mountain biking, driving around 
                                or working out. Face it! In today's society there 
                                are hundreds of options available for our time, 
                                our money and us. But instead, we play games. 
                                If you're a game company, don't you dare cheat 
                                me out of my time. Don't you dare cheat me out 
                                of my life. Why? Because when you cheat me out 
                                of my time, you have just demonstrated that you 
                                don't give a damn about my life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The moment your company stops caring about my time, is the moment I stop caring about your company. If you are going to maximize your extraction of my money - then I am going to maximize my extraction of value. If maximizing my value means that I post every problem with your game, then so be it. It may be YOUR game, but I paid for MY piece of it, and I'm going to get as much satisfaction out of that piece as I can.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We've paid good money for our time with you. You'd better hold to your promises. If you make us promises, you damned well better believe we're going to hold you to your word. We hold our family members to their word. We hold our friends to their word. We hold our spouses, bosses, teachers and employees to their word. We hold those who sell us products and services to their word. You make games? You're no different than the fellow who owns the hardware store down the street. You want a relationship with us? Expect to be held to your word. Quality businesses and people keep their word. If you don't want to be held to your word, don't try to sell us your product.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't lie to us. Lying to us is like OSI telling us Necromancy will be in soon and two years later it still has not been delivered. It's that simple.<br>

</font></p>
                              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                                spectrum that is the industry feels I am every 
                                MMOG's redheaded bastard stepchild. I've been 
                                referred to as the &quot;Anti-Christ&quot; of 
                                online gaming and even less savory titles. I suppose 
                                the title is appropriate, after all, if you make 
                                an MMOG, I tell people how to run amok in it. 
                                That kind of power scares game developers. Why 
                                am I the scourge of the online gaming universe? 
                                It's because I care about the players. I care 
                                about promises made and promises kept. Most importantly, 
                                I care about promises broken.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I really do believe that most game companies want to do the right thing for their fans and consumers. They want to deliver value to their customers. They got into the business of making games because they want to share their worlds with the rest of us. This is certainly a noble goal. In every conversation I have with a developer, when I point to EA/OSI's shoddy treatment of its customer base, everyone said, &quot;We're going to be different, we're going to care about our players.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Great. I'm all for that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you're a gaming company that listens to your players, that keeps an open line of communication with your players, that is willing to see adjustments need to be made or policies changed, then you will get the deserved recognition. Ironically enough, those companies with those open lines of communication are invariably the most capable. These companies usually have the shortest list of bugs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then there are game companies that deploy new features while old ones remain broken. They do not keep open lines of communication, they do not respond to bug reports. In the most extreme examples, they prevent any access, and along with it, any mechanism of conflict resolution. These companies usually fail to appraise their players of changes that are *going* to be implemented, and fail to enforce their rules to a single, authoritative, standard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Strangely enough, most companies are a combination of the two sets of behaviors listed above. What we at the Dr.Twister Network are trying to do is look at how the game companies treat their player base, and reciprocate in kind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turbine, for example, is great with communications regarding their game engine, their network, updates, etc. They accept responsibility for their bugs and do not penalize players for what are developer failings. However at the same time, Turbine doesn't fix critical bugs that receive a lot of attention and complaints from the players. (<a href="/library/dtn-report-gear.shtml">Turbine Example</a>)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The people at Turbine and Microsoft appear to be concerned that the player base of Asheron's Call is dropping by about 10% every month. Listen to what your players want. Implement it. You might be surprised when they stick around. Don't be surprised, however, when you don't listen and people leave. If you don't care about them, there's little reason they should care about the world you've built.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ironically, by posting bugs and telling people how those bugs work, we may actually be keeping players around in these games longer than if they just saw people cheating around them, with nothing for them to do about it. It certainly strikes me as more unfair to let a bug reside with only a select few, than making the bug well-known and available to everyone, so that not only the &quot;elite&quot; will benefit.</font></p>
                              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, 
                                I don't think it's fair that only the &quot;hardcore&quot; 
                                gamers get to exploit the system. While we don't 
                                like anyone exploiting the system, the casual 
                                gamer who pays just as much money as the &quot;hardcore&quot; 
                                gamer should deserve the same access to information 
                                that the hardcore player enjoys. This belief means 
                                while we only intend to help the casual player 
                                protect themselves from exploits, the unintended 
                                outcome is that we make exploiting possible for 
                                the casual player. This is a regrettable, but 
                                obviously a necessary feature, and evil of getting 
                                bugs fixed by developers. </font></p>

                                up are you, the player, able to make an informed 
                                decision as to whether you will stay, whether 
                                you will exploit the game yourself or whether 
                                you will give up the game entirely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you didn't know that people were being victimized similarly, or that there are means of protecting yourself, you might just continue along your merry way. This would mean that the game companies would not have to fix the problems, compensate you for your loss, even the playing field, or face losing you as a customer. This is exactly the kind of situation they want, and exactly the kind of thing I want to expose. Those game companies which refuse to change this mode of operation are really operating in bad faith with you, as they obviously intended not to fix the bug or exploit, but did still intend to continue to receive your money. Just like every consumer, you should be able to make informed decisions. You may hate me, but I make that informed decision possible.</font></p>
                              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, in light of this perspective, 
                                I would argue that it follows that I am providing 
                                a public service. I am making game companies accountable 
                                where they usually refuse such accountability. 
                                No, I don't make the rules. As a consumer advocate 
                                - looking out for you and me - I enforce the rules. 
                                When you think about it, there's really not much 
                                more available to me than to post bugs. Game companies 
                                have shown repeatedly that they don't listen to 
                                bug reports. They don't respond to inquiries. 
                                They don't release information or fix things unless 
                                they have to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the intermediary steps have already been tried. They have shown to be ineffective. When what you're doing doesn't work, you adopt a strategy that does. Given the passion with which people love and hate my work, obviously I'm doing something right. However I'll tell you again, if you don't &quot;get it&quot; or don't like it, please don't come back to the site.<br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've now stated my position. I'm willing to meet the game companies halfway. There are ways that we can work together to post bugs, bring things to public light, and make better games. There are ways to allow you, the gaming public to make informed decisions about the games you play. Making better games takes commitment, and when a game company shows that I have a higher commitment to making their game better than they do, they will suffer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again, I reiterate - to the game companies of the world: You fear my kind and me. This is because my team and I represent a group of angry game players. I do not want this to be the case. I too want to be a team player. But I can only play so far as you will allow me. If being a team player means that I must give up my principles and join you in agreeing that it is acceptable to release sloppy games, then I must refuse. I am not alone however. Everyone who cares about a quality gaming experience eventually comes to my perspective. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If someone like me does not exist, you might find that computer games in general, and online games in particular, will slide down a slope into a morass of disgusted, disaffected players, and bankrupt and demoralized game companies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is why we have a society which values freedom of speech. This is why we have competitive markets. We have been shown time and time again that the combination of competitive pressures and critical (even vicious) feedback forces companies to make products that satisfy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let's raise the standards; let's bring quality back to the games we play.<br>
