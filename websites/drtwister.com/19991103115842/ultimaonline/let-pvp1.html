<p><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Hey Twister and
Greybeard, I want to show you the mouthfull the GM gave me today.
 These are pictures I took in a long conversation with GM Lint.
 I was going grey and running to town some people would attack
me and I would kill them and loot them.  Obviously, many complained
to a GM after I killed and looted them(They wouldn't if they killed
me I am assured). So the GM sends me messeages how this was illegal.
 He says that people who attack greys should stay &quot;BLUE&quot;
to you(the attacker).  So he says I cannot defend myself w/o getting
a murder count.  He says this is illegal/an exploit.  So basiclly
he says people cannot defend themselves w/o getting murder counts.
 So if I am banned sooner or later let it be known I was banned
for defending myself. </FONT></P>
