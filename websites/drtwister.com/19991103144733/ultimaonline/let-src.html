<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Subject: Farewell all<BR>
Date: Wed, 28 Apr 1999 18:32:52 -0400</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I have decided to not return to being a
Senior Counselor, and I suggest you<BR>
all re-evaluate your reasons and motivations for being a Counselor..make<BR>
SURE you are doing it for FUN, and not aspiring to get paid, or
work for<BR>
Origin..Being a Counselor/Senior Counselor is treated like a job
in every<BR>
aspect, except the return benefits &lt;money&gt;.  I will paste
below the email(s)<BR>
I have sent, 1 to UOVault/Stratics, 1 to Zippy &lt;Richard Zinser&gt;,
and the<BR>
email(s) that started all this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Senior Counselor Rath sent an email to ALL
the senior counselors, complaing<BR>
and asking for advice with his life, and when I replied, he forwarded
my<BR>
private reply to Origin, which included some critical venting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Good luck my friends, and be well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Don't waste your time man, OSI is just using
us to do a job they don't want<BR>
to pay people for..their goal is to expend the least money possible,
which<BR>
means more money for them..Throughout the history of UO they have<BR>
consistently done things to demonstrate that money comes first,
everything<BR>
else second..get yourself a real job, and real friends, don't
keep putting<BR>
in 24/7 to some company that could replace you with 'any number
of qualified<BR>
people' in a blink of an eye..all we are to them are slut lackeys
who do<BR>
what we are told, or else..Don't put UO or OSI ahead of your life..there
is<BR>
no future in UO, they aren't going to pay us,our position won't
lead to a<BR>
future with them..who would want a future with them, they are
a shit<BR>
company, look at the quality of UO, and look at the other things
they have<BR>
put out recently.  If they cared about us, they would be paying
us, etc.  We<BR>
are volunteers, nobody ever said anything more, but don't let
this crap<BR>
interfere with your life, I know from experience, I wasted 2 years
of my<BR>
life, vital years, putting in 24/7 to these fuckers who don't
care about us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Put David first, everything else second..work
on your art, work on your<BR>
social life, friends, girlfriend, parents, etc..don't keep wasting
your<BR>
energy on an uncaring corporation who is leeching the life energy
and time<BR>
out of your life, for $9.95 a month and a free game every few
months, or<BR>
whenever Ironwill decides to ship them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Today I had a long chat with Terendil about
my situation. She pointed many<BR>
thing sout to me that made a hell of a lot of sense. First and
formost being<BR>
that I need to do what I want to do with my life... not what someone
else<BR>
wants me to do. As for my what I thought would be my upcoming
absense....<BR>
I'm gonna retract that. I am 99% certain I will be back in full
swing come<BR>
Monday. To be honest I miss this.... I miss it all. I love working
with<BR>
everyone... and regardless of some of the troubles that have plagued
us...<BR>
and teh program in general. I am still here cause i wanna help
something I<BR>
think is great.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I love UO... and I plan to continue with
it. I'm gonna work it in when I<BR>
can. While personal concerns (real life does not apply becuase
this is as<BR>
much part of my &quot;real&quot; life as anything else) will always
come first I can<BR>
put time in for my SRC position. It truely is the only job I have
ever<BR>
had... and Its a job I enjoy. Something that is not easy to come
by =D</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">So consider this my return to the robed
world. :)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">********&lt;Email to SRCs&gt;***********<BR>
If you are easily offended, you might not want to read this, because
I am<BR>
pretty offensive towards Kyra, Rath and Terendil.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Well, I'd like to say farewell to everyone..You
probably all know that Rath<BR>
decided to take a private/confidential email that I sent in reply
to the one<BR>
he sent all of you, in which he spoke of his life problems, and
such..he<BR>
took my response, in which I vented about the problems with UO's
support<BR>
department, and UO in general, and sent it to OSI, who secretly
derobed my<BR>
characters and stole foundership of #uosr.  I could have gotten
Dracor in<BR>
trouble for that, but I am not like that.  I could have done MANY<BR>
things..but I chose not to, because I am not a malicious person.<BR>
You all know the problems with the support department, especially
the<BR>
ass-kissing to get ahead, unqualified people getting ahead because
of<BR>
kissing ass and charisma &lt;yes, that's all about you Kyra, or
do you still<BR>
need to know if Skills drop on purpose now, how to work NoteServ
when you're<BR>
an IRCOp, or how to use Winzip?&gt;, corruption &lt;yes, that's
you Hellbunny,<BR>
would you like another guildstone moved so your guild can loot
a forge, or<BR>
is Goatboy on vacation?&gt;, and backstabbing &lt;Hi Rath, I 'll
return the knife<BR>
you stuck in my back&gt;<BR>
Of course, let's not forget Terendil, the ex-seer who had to change
to SRC,<BR>
because all the Seers hated her for being herself..starting fights/insulting<BR>
people, getting yelled back at, acting offended/overreacting,
etc..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I leave giving my advice..don't trust Rath,
he's a malicious individual who<BR>
has severe problems of his own, far greater than any I had, and
most<BR>
importantly do NOT ever trust Kyra..she will divuldge your secrets
and<BR>
personal things you tell her in trust, under the false illusion
of<BR>
friendship.  I will include the 2 letters I sent, 1 to Zippy &lt;Richard<BR>
Zinser&gt;, who I informed about all the problems personally,
and the one I<BR>
sent to Stratics and UOVault.<BR>
Thanks to mostly everyone for being exceptional partners in this
'job',<BR>
except Kyra, and Rath, and I hope you do NOT let this 'volunteer'
job drain<BR>
you to almost nothing, like I did, and embrace life fully NOW,
and not dream<BR>
of things in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">********&lt;Email to UOVault/UOSS&gt;***********<BR>
	I would like to say farewell to all the players I have helped
throughout my<BR>
2 years as a Counselor and Senior Counselor on Catskills and Atlantic,
and<BR>
apologize for leaving.  Allow me to explain why I must leave,
probably never<BR>
to return.<BR>
	I was putting in at LEAST 6 hours a DAY, and at most, probably
about 16<BR>
&lt;not overestimating&gt;.  My summer vacation basically involved
waking up,<BR>
supporting UO, going to sleep.  I would spend all day doing a
'volunteer'<BR>
job, for free, while all my friends were out putting in less effort
and<BR>
getting money for their efforts.  I never expected to be paid,
although I<BR>
was given the false impression several times that if I 'stuck
with it', we<BR>
would become 'paid' employees.  After recent rumors about off-site
GMs, and<BR>
being a paid employee, I renewed my delusions and continued to
put forth all<BR>
my effort and time into working, for free.  I was experiencing
my own life<BR>
problems and trying to deal with them..when another Senior Counselor
sent<BR>
all the Seniors an email complaining about similar problems, I
replied, and<BR>
gave him advice and vented about how I felt about UO's support
system.  He<BR>
forwarded the email to Origin.  They secretly removed me, and
stole the IRC<BR>
channel I had founded on BeyondIRC.  I realize now, that if they
had not<BR>
done this, I would have never left..I was in a delusion and a
rut, which I<BR>
could not escape on my own.  It even went so far as to dreaming
about UO,<BR>
and doing calls in my sleep!  I hold no grudge against this individual,
only<BR>
knowing I am a better person because of it, and that this individual
has<BR>
some issues of his own to deal with that are more severe than
any I have<BR>
ever faced.<BR>
	During my 'vacation', I woke up..I realized what supporting UO
was doing to<BR>
me, and what it was NOT doing for me..and this is why I must leave..It
is an<BR>
ENTIRELY selfish reason, and I do not deny that..I need to stop
worrying<BR>
about other people, Origin, Ultima, and UO., and worry about myself.
 I<BR>
might return if Origin ever pays for the work done for them for
free, and<BR>
the support department is cleaned up and the corruption, backstabbing,
etc<BR>
is fixed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">	A final thanks goes to all the counselors
I have worked with and who are<BR>
the BACKBONE of the support program..do NOT get mad at Counselors,
they,<BR>
like I was, are working for free, and giving their own time and
energy for<BR>
nothing in return.  I also wish to thank the GMs who helped me
perform my<BR>
job, especially GMs Cochese, Darwin, Datura, Lonestar, Peldor,
Pist,<BR>
Ironwill, and last but in no way least, Oghma.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">************&lt;Email to Zippy&gt;**************<BR>
I don't think I'm going to be coming back to support Ultima Online,
unless I<BR>
am paid a salary.  It is not fair to myself to put forth time
and energy and<BR>
receive nothing in return.  Working for free got me nowhere, and
it's time<BR>
for me to earn a salary for the work I do..Doing free &lt;volunteer&gt;
work, just<BR>
made me feel worthless and unappreciated, because it was all one
way..me<BR>
giving everything I could to support UO, and nothing being given
back<BR>
&lt;Except a rare free game&gt;.  The free account I consider
to be the tool by<BR>
which I worked.  Combine that with all the problems, the treachery,
the<BR>
corruption, and the other things that go on within the UO Support<BR>
department, and I am unsure if I would even want to put myself
back into<BR>
such a working environment, where one has to constantly look over
his or her<BR>
shoulder and wonder who might stab you in the back next.  If you
require my<BR>
services, you know how to reach me.  I still love Ultima, but
Ultima Online<BR>
and its support department simply as no appeal to me, in the current<BR>
situation..if things change, I would consider returning as a paid
employee,<BR>
but I will no longer give all of my energy and time towards something
which<BR>
gave so very very little in return.</FONT></P>
