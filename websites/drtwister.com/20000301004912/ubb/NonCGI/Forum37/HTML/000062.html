</FONT><HR>I've seen an awful lot of complaints regarding the latest patch--and quite frankly, I can't figure out what people think they have to complain about.<P>(Before I go on much further--quick comment. Dr. Twister is as wrong as he can be when he says "it is our game". No, its not. We have a license to play the game--but its not ours. If you dont like it, you have a choice to go play somebody else's game).<P>Anyway...for the most part I have to disagree with statements about how mages have been crippled by the patch. My main character is a 31st level mage (all Schools) and was a little bummed out when I the creature I was blasting was "out of range" from my Drain Life when before patch it was considerable in range. However, (gasp) I found that by getting closer (ie, taking some risk) I was able to still use the spell just fine with the same devastating effect.<P>More than the nerfing of Life spells and the programmers finally fixing the creature vulnerabilities, the author seems to have more of a problem with the fact that there are only 9 hotkeys for spells. While the 9 keys work fine for me (there are only 9 spells I use that I need *that* fast, I have about 20 more spells arranged in the sliding area next to the hot keys), I can understand where some people might need more. It would be nice if Turbine would make spells accessable via some other macro system.<P>I'm not saying what the author wrote is wrong, but I do think its a little biased and that his conclusions derive from that bias. The patch nerfed mages, true. However, that nerfing has not stopped me from wreaking havoc anyplace that I couldnt wreak havoc before. I think the patch has added something significant--the requirement that mages know tactics and strategy.<P>And to those that "had to create a new character because mages were nerfed so bad".... Boo hoo! I feel sooo sorry that you cant kill Lugians from a nice safe distance anymore.<P><BR>------------------<BR><B>Omo</B><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Omo (edited November 29, 1999).]<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#000000">

</FONT><HR>It doesn't seem like big deal to level 31 mages, but honestly anyone lower than level 20 is feeling the hurt. Spells which used to do moderate damage to most creatures do little or none. Is it really accurate in terms of game play if you hit a monsters flesh with a blade or a mace the damage be much different? [macing, btw - the most underated melee skill in the game] There are some creatures which SHOULD be difficult, but a banderling guard resisting level III and IV spells is silly as that particular monster should basically be eatten by any spell of those levels. [I've been killing them with level I and II because every else seems to bounce off of them, in order to conserve mana.] Hell, I have less trouble with banderling chiefs and tuskers which are supposed to be more difficult.<P>It's very easy to take your stance when you are at level 31, but start a newbie mage and you start seeing how painful it is. I remember you mentioning your stats that you started with, you simply could not do them today. A new mages stats have to be more weighted to quickness, e.g.:<P>Str 30<BR>End 60<BR>Cord 10<BR>Quick 60<BR>Focus 75<BR>Self 95<P>Yeah, that's right.. losing spellcraft due to attributes just so you can run and get off those spells; you can advance in xp a lot quicker if you can actually keep yourself alive by controlling your distance with your foes.<P>Things are a lot different than they were, characters with sub-50 quickness and run are basically dead in any fight where they get outnumbered [which happens alot.. heheh]. <P>Some skill in creature may free up 10 pts in one of these stats or another, but I feel these are baseline since the patch. Str might seem a little high, but you also burn components faster now too [have to cast more spells to do the same thing] so you are gonna need it. Even at 30 str, I was still having a hard time keeping myself in tapers for level II spells and when I found some loot I would always be overloaded [the higher quick and endurance DOES help with this a lot].<P>I don't know how you started with 10 quick, my first character [a warrior] had 20 quick and I couldn't stand to play him -- beyond the fact that he was always meat if the battle turned bad. I think the bare min you can have to LIVE these days is about 50.<P>My current quick is 91 and I can outrun anything near my level easily. Which means I can bait 'em or peck on 'em till they drop. :]<P>Just my experience, as frustrating as it was to earn. :P<P>- CV<P><BR>&nbsp;</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#000000">

</FONT><HR>The patch came along when I was level 26, so you might need to refine levels affected by patch clause.  <IMG SRC="http://www.drtwister.com/ubb/NonCGI/wink.gif"><P>Anyway, *every* creature resists higher level spells, not just banderlings. That has absolutely nothing to do witht he patch. The higher level (ie, more complex) a spell is the more likely it is to be resisted. I still use Drain Health I/Harm II when I choose the Life Magic route to killing a beast.<P>I believe you are very wrong in your opinion of what a mages starting stats should be. First, you are already complaining of how crippled you feel, but now you are suggesting you further cripple yourself. You've just significantly reduced the most important stat a mage has (Focus) (some would argue Self, but Focus is used in more formulae). Not only does this compound your problems as a starting mage, but it also cripples you as you reach higher levels. Are you suggesting that before the patch I didnt die even though I had a low Quickness? Stop kidding yourself. I died quite frequently. The difference is I had the skills/stats to remove my penalty quickly and keep advancing. I didnt run from problems--I killed them.<P>However, you dont have to take my opinion as theory. My roommate started a mage a week ago (post patch) and is having excellent results using my advice. He's not leveling quite as quickly as I did, but the patch has nothing to do with that. He has another character he plays more often (an unarmed fighter) and all the spots I used to hang out at to level are so crowded now he cant get the same ratio time/kills as I did. And trust me...if he can do it *anyone* can.<P>Components dont burn any faster than they ever have. Life Magic (especially Drains/Harm) has always burned components at an outrageous rate and moving to higher level spells increases that.<P>As far as I am concerned, the patch did me a huge favor (though it took me a week or two to realize it). I primarily used my Life Magic in dungeons, and War Magic outside. But now War Magic has come to the forefront again--and with a vengance. Now, rather draining the crap out of a monster (using most of my mana pool in the process), I cast an Vulnerability (exploiting whichever weakness the monster may have), then cast the War spell exploiting that Vuln spell. The damage is *incrediable*! I was so dependant on Life Magic before the patch that I hadnt realized what I was missing out on.<P><BR><P>------------------<BR><B>Omo</B><BR><BR>&nbsp;</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#000000">

</FONT><HR>I think the "differences" are negligible for a couple of reasons.<P>1&gt; You simply cannot use anything but level I spells to attack with war till 90+ skill, reliably anyway. No matter what your starting stats are, the difference in skill is less than 10 pts. The effect may be noticable, but it's largly irrelevant with the lower level beasties you're capable of killing at that point in time.<P>2&gt; Not have high quick? What game are you playing? The stuff I kill I can barely get away from with the 129 run I have. :]<BR>Do I have to run? Only when the armor spells give up, it happens on occasion. :] It's silly to build a character that can't control the fight. Beyond that, it's excellent for leading the baddies on goosechases while your friend gets his loot from his corpse. That same skill can be used to press and unbeatable attack as well. I can get off three level III spells before the first one hits the target. Quick does directly effect your casting speed.. I can do III's twice as fast as one of my non-quick friends. The most important thing is that I have a choice, I don't have to sit there and eat vitae because I can't win. Try fighting creature with high magic ability.. either you MOVE your ass or pray that your magic defense works [mines pretty decent, but I don't take the chance of being hit if I don't have to]. A new character isn't going to have high magic def, so running is the only viable option. One of my friends has a level 8 char with rather low quick and he easily gets wasted by banderling chiefs, whereas I was just cutting them down one by one at that time. His war magic was even 20pt higher than mine at that time.<P>3&gt; Dealing with the problems? I'm a life/war/item mage currently, and if I cast vuln III/bolt III of the proper type for a particular creature avg dmg done is 45-65 pts per hit. I usually can stand toe to toe with anything near my level and within 5 levels higher and drop it pretty fast.<P>4&gt; Just because everyone is doing it doesn't make it right. I could care less if you and 40 other people are doing it, start a newbie with life/war/item, and make him low quick.. I'll start one as well.. I guarantee you will eat the ground before you know what happened. I'll be able to dodge every spell you cast, if you decide to be a harming bitch I'll just blast your slow ass while you're standing still.. <P>I don't care about anyones bullshit either,  I only care about what works well. Hell, I don't care about my own bullshit either. I was just stating what I thought. The patch hit me around level 1 so I knew what it was like newbiewise vs. when I posted this: e.g. around 14, and now 17. [seems to slow quite a bit there.. heheh -- haven't had a lot of time to play I'm going to have to move to newer hunting spots I need at least 2k a kill] <P>You &gt;can&lt; build your char either way, but cripes 200 run is handy in the dires with those bastard rats on your ass. :]<P>- CV<BR><BR>&nbsp;</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#000000">

</FONT><HR>I'm certainly not going to argue with Quickness/Run being important...especially, as you mention, in the Direlands where mages have no choice but to run from the hideous Silver Rat (and their puny cousin the Mountain Rat  <IMG SRC="http://www.drtwister.com/ubb/NonCGI/smile.gif">. But since I didnt go to the Direlands until I was level 20, I didnt feel I needed any speed until then (which was certainly true for me). However, by the time I was level 20 I had 150 Run which I could boost much higher with Creature Magic.<P>I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. Your method works find for you, my method works fine for everyone else. (jk).<P><P>------------------<BR><B>Omo</B><BR><BR>&nbsp;</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#000000">

</FONT><HR>Heheh, just a little story from yesterday.<P>I found my first mountain rat yesterday by the lugian outpost near Qalab'r though I didn't go over to say "HI". I had just came out of the outpost after hunting for about an hour and was low on components [my goddamn lighting vuln III spell takes two red tapers.. gah!] and a lithos lugian spawned right outside the damn portal while I was talking to a few buddies, of course.. a mountain rat just chillin' nearby. Unfortunately all I could do at that time was run, at 125% overload, even with my run I'm only a hair quicker than the lithos [normally, I could easily get them just off my radar and blast him, rinse and repeat] it was funny as hell. This damn lithos chased like 5 people and killed one. I had enough tapers for one more go with vuln, so I hit it and then the bastard was chasing me again.. I decided to stand my ground being in good mana.. and managed to half his health.. but then he got too close and I was mana blown.. time to run again.. heheh.. at that point my armor spells [not that it helps much with lithos! Not odd for a Lithos to hit me for 30-50 dmg a hit, my meager 66 health doesn't do much in that situation! :] Probably be better when I can do level IV life] gave up and I spent 3 minutes recharging and reapplying protections. By then, the lithos bought it to the mob that assembled to slay the beast. [like ten people battling this thing!] <P>Them damn things are a bitch, though I kill them single-handedly normally. :] Can't wait for the gigas! :] <P>If I wasn't treasure loaded at the time I certainly wouldn't have had the problem! :]<P>- CV<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#000000">

</FONT><HR>Revision: Don't fuck with the new Lugians! :]<P>I died at least 10 times, yesterday post-patch. It seems now that the lugians speedball their boulders now. The obe's can do a whooping 72pts of dmg [maybe higher, all the health I had at the time] per shot with the rock. Perhaps I should have quit, but I'm persistant and I couldn't think of anything else that would work off 15% vitae quicker. :]  Don't mess with em now unless you got level III protection spells [bludgeoning, armor, etc] or better. They do WAY too much dmg with the rocks, and they throw em fast now. I used to be able to get a level II lighting bolt or Acid Stream on em every time they missed me but it ain't happening now. Safest way to kill them now is with a partner, either another mage to vuln em and help you drop em quick or a warrior to keep em in place. :]<P>They are MUCH tougher than they were, I used to stand toe-to-toe with lagi's and all I'd need was an armor III spell. Don't EVEN try that now. :]<P>- CV<BR><BR>&nbsp;</FONT></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HRE
