            href="downloads/eze.zip">EQ Zone Explorer</A> (download
            includes .ini file and readme.doc/.txt) FINALLY a zone
            viewer for the tutorial program that works!!! Unzip the
            files to any folder OTHER THAN the EverQuest folder. Do
            not put these files in any subfolder of your EverQuest
            folder. I unzipped the files to the following folder
            C:\Program Files\EQ Zone Explorer\&nbsp; and it worked
            fine. I created the new EQ Zone Explorer folder prior to
            unzipping the files. If you have MS Word, I copied the
            info about this program directly from the EZE web site to
            a file called readme.doc. If you don't have MS Word, you
            can read the readme.txt file, but it's not nearly as
            pretty and the information is a couple months older.
            Whatever you do, BE SURE to read one of the readme files
            before using this program. I briefly tested the program on
            the Plane of Fear before adding it to this site to make
            sure it worked, however there are some zones that won't
            work with this (again, see the readme file for an
            explanation). Have fun!!!</TD>
