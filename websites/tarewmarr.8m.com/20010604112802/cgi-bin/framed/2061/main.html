If you would like to join our raid you can contact me at <a href="mailto:PatriotQuest1@cs.com">PatriotQuest1@cs.com</a> Let me know what you think.

If you are so far away from Runnyeye that you absolutely need a teleport then indicate that in your e-mail to me and it will be provided. Please everyone attend and have a great time. ;)

I am Geraint the Scaled Claw, a level 8 Half-Elf Warrior on the Cazic-Thule Server, member of Clan Blackwatch. Yesterday, April 1, 2000, I participated in a GM event that went from Qeynos Hills, to Permafrost, and finally to the Mountains of Rathe. There, in the Mountains, I was selected by a GM named Zato`Zatanov, as the most purest of heart of the participants. After a series of events, I was rewarded with the Crystal Shard of Veeshan, and the surname, although level 8, "the Scaled Claw".
<P>

The Shard is an Artifact, No Drop, Lore, and Magical.

I would like to thank Cybsled and the other members of my group who helped me survive in the mainly high level dungeons, the other participants of the adventure, the GM's of Cazic-Thule, and my Guild, Clan Blackwatch, for emotional support so I didn't break down from being so happy! LoL :/

<a name=tradefair><h2><u><b><i>Brell Serilis Newbie TradeFair</h2></i></u></b>
<P>
Greetings! On Saturday April 8th at 4pm EST House Del`Tiroth, an evil guild on the Brell server, will be hosting a trade fair in East Commonlands at the Ro tunnel. The focus of this event will be the younger players of Norrath. Where most trade fairs feature thulian claws and oracle robes, our fair is to assist the
lower-level players attain patchwork, banded, runed totem staves, skulls of Jhen'Tra, etc. Everyone is welcome to come to play their trade, but only evil players will be attending the following tournament in Neriak. An open battle will be waged in
the Warriors' Hall in the Neriak commons. Sober players will wage a free-for-all battle to win a prize to be announced at the fair, while a drunken brawl will take place afterwards for another prize. For those of you who are thinking, "But I don't have anything to sell!" fear not, you can gather bone chips and bat wings, as higher-level players would rather purchase them than chase after something they don't get experience for (but you might). And as any trade fair, language exchanges will surely take place. Since this is sponsored by an evil guild, you light-dwellers can learn Tier'Dal or Troll (if you don't get eaten).

<BR>Gordon posted the following bit on Harm Touch on the Gameplay
board recently:
<P>
Since harm touch only refreshes about once an hour I think it needs to be unresistable.
<P>
Teerog said: All offensive things should be resistable in some fashion, via resists, armor, whatever.
<P>
We have to agree with Teerog here. Nothing in the game is meant to be a free-ride. LOH can fizzle. HT can be resisted. That is how these things work.
<P>
Hour and a half, actually.
<P>
Oh, and it's 72 minutes.
