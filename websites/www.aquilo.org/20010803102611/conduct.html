        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Membership in Aquilo Phoenix means that 

          you agree to follow some basic rules of conduct. Most of these are common 

          sense, and should take no effort for any honorable person to follow.</font></p>

        <font face="sans-serif" size="2">

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">As a general rule of thumb, remember 

          the following principles:</font></p>

        <font face="sans-serif" size="2">

        <OL>

          <LI><font face="sans-serif" size="2">All of Verant's rules of conduct 
            are also Aquilo Phoenix rules of conduct. These are viewable <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_conduct.html"><b>here</b></a>.</font> 
          <LI><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Disputes with other guilds or players 

            will be handled by our guild officers, not by individual members.</font> 

          <LI><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Be polite to other Aquilo Phoenix 

            members and treat them with the same respect that you wish to be treated.</font>

          <LI><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Be mature in your words and deeds, 

            and let your conduct be an example for others to follow.</font> 

        </OL>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">If a guild member is accused of violating 

          any of our rules, that member will be considered innocent until proven 

          guilty of the charges. Guild officers will investigate any claims of 

          wrongdoing. Should the party in question be proven to be in violation 

          of our rules, guild officers will decide what punishment is appropriate. 

          Please note, however, that some actions are considered to be so serious 

          that the only recourse is removal from the guild.</font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Some specific rules of conduct are 

          examined below.</font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><B>Guild 

          Tags Must Be Shown At All Times</B></font></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 

          </font></font></font></p>

        <font face="sans-serif" size="2"><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">We want our members to be proud that they are a part of the Aquilo Phoenix family, and to always remember that 

          the actions they take reflect upon all of us. As such, we require that 

          guild members always display their guild tag. Using /anon to mask your 

          class, race, level, and guild is unacceptable. However, members can 

          use the /roleplay command in situations where they don't want other 

          players to know their class, race, or level. This is useful, of course, 

          to avoid constant requests for teleports or resurrections.</font></p>

        <font face="sans-serif" size="2"><BR>

        </font> 

		<p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><B>Alternate Characters (Alts) Cannot Join Other Guilds</B></font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Members of Aquilo Phoenix may choose to play more than one character. Usually, the player will have one character that they play most often (referred to as their "main") and other characters that they play less often (referred to as their "alts"). The player may choose to have alts guilded, or may choose to have them remain outside the guild. However, alts are not permitted to join any other guild - they must be members of Aquilo Phoenix, or else remain guildless. Further, alts are expected to obey the same standards of conduct as mains. If it is found that the alt of a member, whether wearing our guild tag or not, has broken the Aquilo Phoenix rules of conduct, then all characters of that player are subject to removal from the guild. By joining Aquilo Phoenix, you agree to behave according to our rules. This doesn't just apply to characters on screen; it applies to the person behind the keyboard.</font></p>

        <font face="sans-serif" size="2"><BR>

        </font> 

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><B>Do Not Kill Steal</B></font></p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">

        <p>When an individual or group has engaged an NPC in combat or is camping 

          a spawn, it is unacceptable to deliberately attempt to take the kill 

          from them. If a group appears to be in trouble, ask if they want your 

          assistance before entering combat (unless, of course, it is obvious 

          that they will die without your help). In situations where an individual 

          or group is monopolizing an area and will not allow you to get on a 

          waiting list or otherwise participate, you are expected to follow Verant's 

          "play nice" rules and take the matter to a GM.</p>

        <p>Example: You are logged in with your low-level character and go to 

          fight at the orc camps. The group that is there is hostile towards you 

          and tells you that you can't be in the area. You should file a /petition 

          with a GM to resolve this. It is not acceptable for you to log in a 

          higher-level character (or ask for the assistance of a higher-level 

          character) to come to the camp and steal the kills from the group that 

          is there. This is considered kill stealing, and proven cases will result 1

          in removal from the guild.</p>

        <BR>

        <p><B>Do Not Deliberately Train Other Players</B></p>

        <p>Trains of NPC's, especially in dungeon environments, are a fact of 

          life in Norrath. Accidental trains happen all the time, and while these 

          are unfortunate when they cause harm to innocent players, trains are 

          sometimes unavoidable. However, less scrupulous players may intentionally 

          bring a train upon other players to drive them away from an area or 

          to exact revenge for a perceived wrong done to them. Deliberately bringing 

          a train of NPC's onto another player or players is considered a bannable 

          offense by Verant, and Aquilo Phoenix looks upon this action no less harshly. 

          Training is never justified, and any confirmed report of it being done 

          by a guild member will result in removal from Aquilo Phoenix.</p>

        <BR>

        <p><B>Do Not Bash Other Guilds</B></p>

        <p>If you feel that members of another guild have wronged you, report 

          the specifics of the incident immediately to one of our guild officers. 

          They will attempt to resolve the situation. It is not acceptable for 

          you to insult, badger, provoke, or otherwise engage members of another 

          guild. Nor is it acceptable behavior for you to insult or belittle another 

          guild in any public forum, including /say, /ooc, /shout, message boards, 

          or guildchat.</p>

        <p>Remember, guilds don't behave poorly; people do. Don't assume that 

          the actions of one individual, or even a group, represent the beliefs 

          or practices of an entire guild. We wouldn't want Aquilo Phoenix to be 

          judged by something a single member did, and we should afford the same 

          courtesy to other guilds.</P>

        <BR>

        <p><B>Do Not Ninja Loot</B></p>

        <p>"Ninja" looting means to sneak into an area and loot the kills of other 

          parties. This term is most often applied to situations where high-level 

          NPC's drop rare items. Ninja looting is despised by every honorable 

          player in the game, and any guild member proven to participate in such 

          an activity will be immediately removed from our ranks.</p>

        <BR>

        <p><B>Do Not Farm Plane Breaks</B></p>

        <p>Note: This mostly applies to Plane of Fear.</p>

		<p>"Breaking" a plane means to enter when the plane is fully spawned, kill the roamers, and secure the entrance area for other members of your raid to join you. Once your raid members have killed every spawn (or as many as they intended to kill), the raid is ended and everyone leaves.</p>

		<p>"Farming" is defined as staying in the plane after everything is dead and killing mobs as they respawn. This is considered dishonorable by most guilds in the game, as the real challenge in a plane raid is to break in and take control of the zone. Staying to kill respawns is much, much easier, and is done merely to farm items.</p>

		<p>Even worse than farming your own break is to farm the breaks of others. 

          This happens when the raiding party that breaks the plane leaves, and 

          another party enters the plane and begins farming the respawns. 

        <p>Aquilo Phoenix will not farm its own breaks, and members of Aquilo Phoenix are not allowed to participate in farming the breaks of another guild. Any member invited to farm a plane is expected to turn the invitation down. Because of the onus associated with farming a break, members who participate in such activity face removal from the guild.</p> 

        <BR>

        </font></font>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><B>Do Not Beg For Handouts</B></font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">It is unacceptable, in guild chat 

          or via /tell, to pester other guild members for donations of items or 

          cash, teleports, resurrections, or to plead for help camping an item. While members are encouraged 

          to help others in the guild, no one should feel pressured to give things 

          away just because a guildmate asks for them. Members can ask for help 

          completing quests, but they should do so in a polite and non-invasive 

          manner.</font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Unacceptable: &quot;Hey, can one of 

          you level 50's come kill stuff in Mistmoore for me? I really really 

          want my Armor of Ro!&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Acceptable: &quot;I'm about to go 

          to Mistmoore to camp a couple items for my Armor of Ro quests. Is there 

          anyone who's free who could lend me a hand?&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Membership in Aquilo Phoenix is not 

          about power leveling or &quot;twinking,&quot; it is about being part 

          of a family that helps and encourages one another to have fun and be 

          successful. Beggars do not help the guild be successful, and thus will 

          not be welcome.</font></p>

        <font face="sans-serif" size="2"><BR>

        </font> 

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><B>Be Respectful and Courteous To 

          Verant Staff Members</B></font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">It is our desire that Aquilo Phoenix 

          have a positive reputation with everyone in the game, including the 

          Verant staff. Guild members should always be courteous to GM's and guides, 

          even when they don't give us the answers we're looking for. At GM events, 

          guild members are expected to either roleplay appropriately or observe 

          quietly. Spamming, engaging in disruptive combat, spell casting, or 

          otherwise interfering with GM events will not be tolerated.</font></p><BR>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><B>Tolerate All Beliefs, Races, and 

          Practices</B></font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Aquilo Phoenix does not allow its members 

          to make comments, jokes, or attacks, in any public or private forum, 

          against the race, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status of 

          another player. We do not require that you agree with or even accept 

          beliefs or practices that you find objectionable; we simply expect that 

          you will keep your opinions private.</font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Please note that it is perfectly acceptable 

          to make roleplaying comments about the races of other in-game characters. 

          For example, it is fine for a human to refer to dark elves as "inkies," 

          or for a dwarf to say that trolls are "oversized swamp rats." Such comments 

          generally enhance the gaming experience when they are used in the proper 

          context. It is when negativity is directed at the people behind the 

          keyboards that action must be taken.</font></p>
