        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><font face="sans-serif">Guidelines 

          For Loot Distribution</font></B></font> 

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Part of the fun of being in a closely 
          knit family like Aquilo Phoenix is joining together with guildmates 
          to engage in battle against powerful enemies. While the true value of 
          such experiences is found in the bonds of freindship and trust that 
          grow between members, a nice side benefit lies in the trophies that 
          can be carried away from these encounters.</font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, sometimes the desire 
          for valuable items leads to conflict, even between close members of 
          a family. For this reason, Aquilo Phoenix has established a guildline 
          for how loot from guild activities will be handled. Please note that 
          this guideline applies only to raids originated by Aquilo Phoenix. When 
          our guild members are invited to participate in activities lead by other 
          guilds, we must abide by the rules established by their leaders.</font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><B>Note:</B> It is good planning for 

          a raid leader to be clear about who can roll for known drops before 

          the raid begins. This will help avert hard feelings later on, and also 

          speeds up the loot distribution process.</font></p>

        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Our loot rule is very simple and clear:</font></p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">If you are <b>able</b> to use the 

            item, <b>will</b> use the item, have a certain <b>need</b> for the 

            item, and feel you have done enough to <b>deserve</b> the item, then 

            you may roll for the item.</font></p>

        </blockquote>

        <p> <font face="sans-serif" size="2">This hardly sounds like a rule, especially 
          compared to some of the elaborate looting guidelines established by 
          many powerful guilds. The important difference in our rule is that it 
          is based upon the priciples of honor, honesty, humility, and sacrifice. 
          These are all virtues that Aquilo Phoenix members are expected to possess 
          in abundance. </font>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        <p> <font face="sans-serif" size="2">Let us examine the individual segments 
          of the loot rule. <br>
          <br>
          </font> 
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><b>Able to use the item</b> - This 
          means that the race and class of the character that you are playing 
          on the raid has the ability to use the item. Example: Melee types can't 
          wear a Robe of the Ishva, so they should not try to win it when a caster 
          who can use it is in the group. Loot from raids is meant to go to the 
          characters who are actually present, and should not be used to twink 
          another character who is not in attendance.</font></p>
        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><b>Will use the item.</b> - This means 
          that you will actively use the item on the character participating in 
          the raid. Example: Monks can wear golden efreeti boots, but they are 
          too heavy and have no useful stat boosts for the monk class. Therefore, 
          since the monk wouldn't actually wear the boots, she should not roll 
          against a class who would make use of them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><b>Have a certain need for the item</b> 
          - This means that the item in question is better than an item for the 
          same slot or weapon type that the character on the raid currently uses. 
          If you have a better item than the one that dropped, and someone else 
          on the raid who can use it does not, you should not roll for the item.</font></p>
        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><b>Have done enough to deserve the 
          item</b> - This is the trickiest principle to quantify, and is the most 
          dependent upon the individual honor of our guild members. It is a fact 
          that on certain raids, especially in the planes, some guild members 
          will have put in more time and effort than others have. Ideally, the 
          people who have put in the most time and effort, and who have made the 
          most significant contribution to the raid, will reap the rewards of 
          their labor. Example: A level 47 ranger cannot join a Fear raid at the 
          break, but arrives some hours later. After he has been there a few hours, 
          a breastplate drops which this ranger needs, but so does the level 50 
          ranger who helped break the plane. While the level 47 ranger has made 
          a significant contribution in the last few hours, and by most players' 
          standards would certainly be entitled to roll for the item, it would 
          be in the intersts of humility and sacrifice for him to bow out of the 
          roll so that the level 50 ranger could have it. This would be an especially 
          nice thing to do if the level 50 ranger was a veteran of multiple Fear 
          raids, and had missed (or declined) previous opportunities at the breastplate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="sans-serif" size="2">We realize that there are many factors 
          that determine what is a "fair" way to divide loot, and that special 
          circumstances will arise which will require decisions that are far from 
          clear cut. In situations where the parties involved cannot reach an 
          agreement, the dispute will be settled by the raid leader. But if all 
          guild members put aside personal interests and abide by the priciples 
          of honor, honesty, humility, and sacrifice, the path to take will be 
          made clear.</font></p>
