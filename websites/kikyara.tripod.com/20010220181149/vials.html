<h1>Vials</h1>
<br>
<br>
Vials are for storing the produced poison in a flask. You can buy them or
produce them with pottery. It is strongly recommended you learn pottery
because the produced vials are much cheaper than the bought one and you
can make quite a coin from selling them. There are three kinds of vial.
<br><br>
<ul>
<table>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top><img border=0 src="vial.jpg"></td>
      <td valign=top><b>Poison Vial</B><br>
      This are the vials for easier poisons. After the first tier they
      are not used anymore. This is the simplest and cheapest vial
      of all.<br>
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top><img border=0 src="vial.jpg"></td>
      <td valign=top><b>Lined Poison Vial</B><br>
      When the poisons get tougher you need vials that are better
      than the regular ones. Lined vials are the vials for the
      vials for the first and second tier.<br>
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top><img border=0 src="vial.jpg"></td>
      <td valign=top><b>Sealed Poison Vial</B><br>
      This is used for the strongest poisons from the second up to the
      fifth tier. They are quite expensive but the choice of a high
      seasoned rogue.<br>
      </td>

<h1><a name="suspension">Suspension Fluids</a></h1>
<br>
<br>
The suspension fluids are liquids that are used to dissolve and bind the
ingredients. Different suspensions are needed for different poisons. All
of this suspensions have to be purchased from a <a href="merchants/merchants.html">
merchant.</a>
<br>
<ul>       
<table>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top><img border=0 src="vial.jpg"></td>
      <td valign=top><b>Suspension</B><br>
      The simple suspension for everyday. Used only in the first tier.<br>
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top><img border=0 src="vial.jpg"></td>
      <td valign=top><b>Constrict Suspension</B><br>
      A better version of the ordinary suspension used mainly in the second tier.
      Occassionally you need it also in the first and third tier of poison.<br>
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top><img border=0 src="vial.jpg"></td>
      <td valign=top><b>Larent Suspension</B><br>
      Used for the tough poison of the 3rd tier the larent suspension has
      excellent quality and will hold the ingredients closely eternal.
      Handle this with care anyway.<br>
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td valign=top><img border=0 src="vial.jpg"></td>
      <td valign=top><b>Etheral Suspension</B><br>
      Only the strongest poisons need the etheral suspension. This kind of
      suspension is the magic kind for ingredients that refuse to bind with
      any other kind of suspension. Therefore it is expensive and hard to
      get. Not every <a href="merchants/merchants.html">merchant</a> is able
      to sell you this precious fluid.
