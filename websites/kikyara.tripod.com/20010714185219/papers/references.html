<h1>Special Thanks for help to:</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Rirek Ebonheart of Morrell-Thule</B><br>
Thank you for your dedication, and your help all the time. Rirek brought some
of the hardest-to-get ingredients, tried to learn Combine and Dwarf as a Troll
Shadowknight and is always there when I need any help.<br>
<br>
<b>The Order of the White Hand (-MT)</B><br>
Thanks to many members of the guild for helping me farming<br>
<br>
<b>Quip Quarrel</B><br>
He made the &quot;Unofficial tome to mastering poison&quot; my table is based
on. I took various information from his material, the links are included into
the references below.<br>
<br>
<b>The Hall of Heroes (-MT)</B><br>
At the same time to <b>Bad Faction</B> but closely all BF members joined to HoH.
Both guilds are reall fine ones. Special thanks to Aluil, Thoruk and Trazina.
<br>
<br><b>Greetings to the Rogues of Morell-Thule, especially to:</B><br>
Nathomin, Tseimar, Brennon, Fredow, Cliaand, Alys, Ilalotha, Mlavenu and Diggle<br>
