<br>
The Bacteria beats out the Gnome as the smallest playable race and can be any class. The
bacteria also has the racial skill of Sicken and Multiply. Whenever you come across a
corpse, you can select Multiply. The corpse will disppear, thus disabling the ability to
loot it, but you then have 6 more clones of your bacteria character that act as pets.
Rumors of unbalance are squashed by the fact that a Cure Disease spell causes instant
death. <br>

<font SIZE="2">

<p></font><font size="3">The latest addition to Everquest, coming in the add-on is the new
race, Midget. Now the Midgets are not to be confused with the dwarfs, gnomes, or
halflings, as they are closer related to humans, but tiny. Midgets wear small armor and
wield weapons slightly differently than other classes. Daggers are the 1H Slashing weapons
of choice (to replace the way too large swords) , and Arrows are wielded in the hands as
piercing weapons (to replace spears.)</p>

<p>There are two distinct type of Midgets, Oompa Loompas, and Munchkins. Each group have
specialized skills and their own starting towns.</p>

<p>Oompa Loompas at level 5 get the skill &quot;Lesson Teaching.&quot; This skill grows
with use, and is very powerful at higher levels. A level 20 Oompa Loompa midget will be
expected to be able to Teach a Lesson to an equal levelled monster that will cause the
monster to tuck its tail in shame in follow for not being more wise and understanding.
This is especially effective if the Oompa Loompas group together and use Lesson Teaching
simultaneously. Oompa Loompas also get the new trade skill of &quot;Candy Making.&quot;
This creates a money making opportunity for the Oompa Loompas as their Munchkin brethren
often wield Lollipops for their weapons.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">The Munchkins get the brightest and silliest of armor in Norrath.
They start with the Hide skill though, with the drawback of uncontrollable giggling while
hiding, so particular attentive players and mob's will know they are near, just not where.
There are two new gods to choose from for the Munchkins, depending on what class they
choose, either Glenda the Good Witch, or The Wicked Witch of the West. Most Munchkin
necros (who summon scarecrows) choose to follow the Wicked Witch, and likewise, the
Munchkin Magicians follow Glenda.</p>

<p>Either group of Midget get the bonus skill of &quot;Perform&quot;. This skill is an
Area of Effect skill that causes all mobs and players in the vicinity to stop whatever
they are doing and watch them do a little dance or sing a song. Resists to this skill
almost never occur, making the Midget very popular for groups who want to take on monsters
in dungeons where trains can be rampant. All in all, a well balanced race, we fully expect
that their popularity will grow and add to Everquest in a way no other race can.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#800080">The Kanuck by Ativannus</font></p>

<p><img src="StvnWright.gif" alt="StvnWright.gif (7729 bytes)" WIDTH="114" HEIGHT="119"> <small>&quot;The last week
in August, we went camping way up in Canada. We were laying around in the woods and stuff,
and I don't know how she did it but she got poison ivy on her brain and the only way she
can scratch it is if she thinks about sandpaper.&quot; - S. Wright, Kanuck</small></p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p></font><font size="3">Sightings of this race have increased dramatically in recent
times, leading to a great deal of speculation as to their origin. Most experts believe
that they are decendents of the hardy Barbarians, given their affinity to the frigid
climate of northern Antonica. Seemingly oblivious to the cold, they can be seen walking
about barechested in the fiercest blizzard.</p>

<p>Their language is a local dialect of Common. The most obvious distinction is their
frequent use of &quot;eh&quot; e.g. &quot;How's it going, eh?&quot; or &quot;Time to die,
a moss snake, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>Although all character classes are open to this race, most opt to become warriors.
Wearing thickly padded pieces of armor, they are fond of mounting sharp steel blades on
the bottoms of their boots in order to move quickly on the ice. Armed with sticks with
curved wooden blades, they are devastating opponents, bludgeoning enemies with their
sticks, elbows, and fists.</p>

<p>Travellers from Antonica's southern regions should be aware that the Kanucks brew a
stronger ale than most Antonicans are accustomed to. They tend to view other races'
brewing characteristics with disdain. They often remark that outlanders' ale is &quot;like
sex in a canoe.....#$@*ing close to water.&quot;</p>

<p>(Note: Kanucks are not to be confused with Canucks, a mythical race from a different
plane.)</font></p>
