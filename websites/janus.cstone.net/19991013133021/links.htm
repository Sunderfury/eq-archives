<p>Here are some Klaknak approved links. </p>

<p><a href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/">AllaKhazam's</a> - I realize saying this is
almost sacrilegious, but I oftentimes find this site more helpful than the biggies because
this one links you to everywhere else in the EQ universe. This is <strong>the</strong>
place to go to get your maps, guides and other knickknacks.</p>

<p><a href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm">The Everquesting Bard</a> -
Talies provides a wealth of information on Bards, but this site's biggest strength lies in
its well written, fun to read Journal of a Traveler.</p>

<p><a href="http://eq.stratics.com/evercrest/">Evercrest</a> - A site containing humorous
tidbits that approach (but do not meet) the humorocity of this site. Here is what he says
of the Cackling Klaknak: &quot;A great collection of assorted EQ-related humor. I
guarantee you'll get at least a few laughs out of this site.&quot; A few laughs? Just a
few? Oh well, there is no pleasing some people.</p>

<p><a href="http://everevent.gamestats.com/">EverEvent</a> - The place to go for
information about EQ events. Sure, you could go to EQSS or EQVault, but then you would
have to scroll down through the bazillion different petitions (assuming you can even
connect to the site) to find your eventful tidbits of knowledge.</p>

<p><font size="3"><a href="http://magnus.uong.com">The Magnus Files</a> - A great EQ humor
site by the master of the odd, Magnus. And, for those masochists out there who still play
UO, he has some UO humor as well.</font></p>
