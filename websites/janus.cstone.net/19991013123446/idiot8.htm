<p><font color="#800080"><big>The drunken fisherman - by Tycho, Innoruuk</big></font><br>
<br>
One day in Qeynos (got bashed quite good sometimes in BlackBurrow this day) I decided to
go fishing instead, working on my Alcohol Tolerance and have a good time ... I sat down,
started fishing, drank some bottles&nbsp; ... and relaxed - but then it was 1 bottle too
much - everyone knows the feeling - I started zapping around.</p>

<p>*SPLASH*</p>

<p>I fall into the water and was sinking to the ground</p>

<p>*DAMN*</p>

<p>No problem just swim up and ... swim ... SWIM </p>

<p>*hit the PgUp and move*</p>

<p>OK, no panic ... let's try again. </p>

<p>*first bubble of air disappeared*</p>

<p>Maybe I can't swim, when I'm drunk? That's funny, but ... </p>

<p>*second bubble of air disappeared*</p>

<p>OK, that's not funny anymore. Maybe a lag? No, I can click at the inventory, but I'm
&nbsp; stunned. I can't die fishing ... </p>

<p>*third bubble of air disappeared*</p>

<p>PANIC! That's impossible. No! NOOOOOOO! </p>

<p>*fourth bubble of air disappeared*</p>

<p>I will die a fishing pole in one hand, a bottle of beer in the other ... I'm a real
hero ... OK that's it. Bye, farewell and good night!</p>

<p>DAMN! - I'm still SITTING!</p>

<p>[Editor's Note: I realize that a similar story has been posted before (I think that one
involved a boat), but the above idiot file is especially tasty because it is just the sort
of thing that could happen to you in real life. If you don't believe me, go out tonight,
buy several bottles of King Cobra and Robotussin and go sit beside a lake, pounding each
one. Alcohol really can disturb reality if you try hard enough. For example, one night,
early in my college years, some friends and I finished off a bottle of Everclear and, I
kid you not, I became confused by my own arm. I couldn't figure out what it was. It was
just this ... thing ... attached to my body. Anyway, I thought I would share. Drugs kill.
Alcohol is a drug. Therefore alcohol kills.]</p>

<p>This is about Svol, a human warrior: Svol said: &quot;I witnessed the ultimate act of
uncoolness last night. Well,&nbsp; I'd just made 15th and went back to the warriors guild
to train Double Attack (woohoo), since I've made the teens I've been a litte ballsy and no
longer walk around the PvP area in the arena. (In case u didn't now, once u set foot in
the arena ur PVP is ON, and as we say, &quot;The gloves are off.&quot;) Well, I made it
through the first time, spent 9 training sessions on Dbl attack, time to camp out and hit
the sack, was about midnight. Well, off I go straight across the middle of the PvP area. I
know, I know, I'm a dumbass, but hey, I'm a warrior, right? Well, thats when I see the
tell-tale green glow of a root spell, cast on me, ARGH!!! I think. Then someone named
Incanta says, &quot;Hi.&quot; Then WHAM!! One spell and bye-bye 430 something Hit points,
DEAD. You have been slain by Incanta. I did, however have just <br>
enough time to see the witch become visible, in the shadows. Two things I noticed almost
immediately, one she had a last name (means she's 20th+), and two she conned red to me.
Ugh! Well, there I am back in plains north of Qeynos. Hoofing it back to the arena,
fastlike. For they can loot my $$ and take one item, at least I'm pretty sure thats how it
works. Well she was nice enough to not loot me at least. I wasn't even mad, at first, I
wanted to at least talk to her. I did have a problem with how I was&nbsp; ambushed, but I
did just walk right through the middle. Well, the only response she would give was,
&quot;I was bored.&quot; Ho HO! That got me going. I proceed to, in character mind, berate
her for awhile. Damn mages and their invis spells though. I knew she was there, just
couldn't see her. Well, it was at this point that her friend, another 20th+ gnome, his
invis spell must've worn off, for into view he pops. By this time, they'd 86ed a few ppl,
and there I was carefully standing OFF of the PvP area with about 4 other victims, fuming.
It was then that I notice some newbie punk, SITTING IN THE MIDDLE of the arena, egging ppl
on. &quot;Come and get me, I can take all of you!&quot; And such crap was he saying. I
conned him, green. Did a /who on him, hmm, anonymous. And judging by his erudite newbie
clothing he was very low lvl. Well, along comes someone else, not bothering to stop and
see why there are like 4 ppl standing there looking at this punk. This guys, looked to be
about 8-10th warrior, takes this puke on. Well, I don't think I have to tell u what
happened, WHAM! Root, flash of blue, DEAD 8-10th warrior. And a giggle from Incanta.
That's when I went off, /shouting to all that would hear, &quot;There are a coupla 20th+
jerks<br>
here in the arena, and they're using a low lvl punk at bait, don't fall for it!&quot;
Well, THIS finally got a response out of them, heh heh. Assholes, and I called them as
much and left. But not after I reported this crap to the only Guide I could find, they was
NO GM on the entire Rathe server. Am I being touchy, or did this suck?</p>

<p>Svol's second attack on the Idiot Files! He wrote: On a lighter note. I was soloing the
elite/commander room (excellent loot and xp), there was a group of 4 in the other room,
very cool ppl! Well, there I am toe-to-toe with a commander, and thanks to Deliah's buffs
I'm kicking its ass. Until, that mxgfdqym 8 headed 26 armed Gnoll beast comes running in
behind this 8th lvl Cleric jackass named Skyshroud! That zttqrk trained a whole phuj load
of them right to me! And then promptly died of course. heh heh But that pissed me off,
when u get trained u head for a zone! Not one of the toughest places in all of BB! I had
my hands full with the commander, and if it hadn't been for that other group, i woulda
died 4 sure, cause who'd they attack after killing Skyshroud? (henceforth to be refered to
as &quot;scrub&quot;), why me or course. Hey, I don't care what lvl u are, a commie AND
the 8 headed gnoll beast, no way man! Well, we beat them back and barely survived. The ppl
in the other group informed me that each of them had died at least once, and some case
many times, in trains that that scrub had pulled down on top of them Apparently, he's
always getting in over his head. Obie, you've been in that area of BB, would u take an 8th
lvl chr there? hell no! And seeing as how it's such a looong run to the zone, he figures
he'll just train em to the commander/elite room! Scrub. Well, I had my revenge! When he
died his body fell into the wall, and if its happened to you, it can be a pain sometimes
to find a corpse that's falling into the wall. Only his feet were visible, so, I sat down
right in front of them, ha! A few minutes passed and there he was, &quot;Hey any of u guys
seen my corpse?&quot; , to which I respond, &quot;Ha! I looted it and took all of your
stuff punk! You can duel me for your stuff!&quot; To which I stand up and challenge him to
a duel, he refuses of course, and can only respond with rude gestures. The other group by
this time are all ROFLing and snickering, they love it. This scrub is actually buying it,
he thinks I've looted all his stuff and wont give it back w/o a fight! hahahaha it was
awesome. This goes back and forth for about ten minutes, and he almost gets killed again,
when the elite spawns right between us, as I decided to sit back and let it take a few
chunks outta the scrub 1st, hahaha, look at him run!!!!! BUWAHAHA Then I disposed of the
elite, by this time, one of the guys from the other group takes pity on the poor bastard
and tells him that his<br>
corpse is in the wall and that ppl cannot loot u w/o /consent. Well, i didn't have a prblm
with it, the scrub's learned his lesson by now, I thought! Well, apparently either this
scrub's lag is so bad, or there's some kinda bug so he can't see the corpse at all! I had
to chuckle at that, and say, &quot;Give me consent, I'll get it 4 you?&quot; haha, right!
Wow, this got long! To make a long story short, he finally got his stuff, after he gave
consent to that guy that took pity on him, and quickly gated away, after flipping me and
everyone else off of course.</p>

<p><font color="#800080"><big>Stupid Bard Tricks - by Tom F.</big></font><br>
<br>
One night our group of 6 brave adventurers where killing Skeletons and Gnolls in the entry
area of Lake Rathetear. We where getting good experience as well as good loot. But after a
while more and more groups started zoning in and it soon became a sqabble over who would
get the next spawn. Rather then getting involved in an argument over who stole who's kill
we decided to explore the Lake zone.</p>

<p>After running around the rim of the lake and finding nothing worth bloodying our swords
on, we swam out to the islands and started to explore them.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey&quot; Says our intrepid Bard Epresley, &quot;I found some kind of underwater
dungeon over here.&quot;</p>

<p>Knowing full well that our Bard was itching to try out his new group water breathing
song, we decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>&quot;Ok, Where at?&quot;, Asked Zencore the Ranger, &quot;I have all kinds of
aqua-goblins on the scope.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's under the island. Meet me on top of the big hill and I'll show
you.&quot; Answers Epresley.</p>

<p>Our adventurers met the Bard on top of a huge mountain on the island. He explained how
he had jumped off the mountain - landed in the water and swam under the island.</p>

<p>&quot;Like this&quot;, He added, and playing his speed song ran, jumped and
&lt;splash&gt; entered the water.</p>

<p>&quot;Cool&quot; the other 5 members said and headed off after him.</p>

<p>Run, Jump &lt;CRUNCH&gt; Jump &lt;CRUNCH&gt; &quot;Was did that say? 386 damage? 247
damage?&quot;</p>

<p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</p>

<p>We return to our bind point (all 5 of us) then the following message appeared on our
screens.</p>

<p>Epresley tells the group &quot;Ok... Your all probable really mad at me right now. But
I thought it would be a cool way to enter the dungeon.....&quot;</p>

<p>Zencore tells the group &quot; But DAD! - All the other kids are doing it - Yes Son,
but if all the other kids jumped off a cliff....&quot;</p>

<p>Canax tells the group, &quot;We are all a bunch of damn Lemmings!&quot;</p>

<p>Slowly the group reformed around the bottom of the hill - collected their corpse and
made a mental note.</p>

<p>PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING FASTER - CAN JUMP FARTHER.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800080"><big>Indian Giver - Eileena, Shadowknight of Povar</big></font></p>

<p>I recently decided to try my hand at a human shadowknight, not really to play as to
test the limits of KoS... So I get her to lvl 2 after getting a hang of the SK ropes and
make a run to Neriak, mainly to see if the guards will kill me when I walk into their fair
city (DID they kill me? You'll have to find that part out the hard way ^_^). So as I'm
running, I decide to skirt as high up the mountainside of the commonlands as possible to
avoid nasties, all the way to the top where the terrain flattens out as a mesa for a small
distance. As I'm running I suddenly come across a large bag laying on up there -- I try to
click on it but it doesn't open. I click on it a few times more, wondering what's in it
while figuring that someone was trying to twink another character by leaving something
valuable up on this isolated mountain-top. Sure enough, as I round about it I see a
brightly colored billboarded texture underneath the bag, also known as dropped money! I
click on it and I see that I'm holding some platinum! I put it in my inventory and it
registers as 100 platinum! I'm ecstatic!</p>

<p>Screen goes black suddenly<br>
&lt;Server not responding&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;NOOOOO!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Needless to say I log back on as fast as possible, and find that there's no bag there
anymore and that none of the platinum I put on my person is there... Apparently I had been
booted off before the game had saved my progress, so I have no idea what happened to any
of this windfall but all I know is that I didn't get any of it... Sigh...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800080"><big>Oh yeah ...&nbsp; - Svala</big></font></p>

<p>As has everybody, I've gone through all the newbie problems, learning to /con,
remapping my auto-attack to the + key, etc. I haven't seen this one though.<br>
<br>
I'm out in Everfrost with Svala, my Barbarian Shaman and I've just discovered an igloo
that I really like because it seems to be on a major route for nasties to take on their
way to Halas. Of course I want to avoid all of them until I get there though for safety
sake, so I take the high road, walking on the mountainsides of Everfrost (as everybody
knows, this in itself can be extremely hazardous). Well, I'm almost there and I see a
little area to get through between the wall and a spire, unfortunatly my large barbarians
gets stuck in the crack between the spire and the wall and I can't move. I can sit and
turn, but forward and backward movement is out of the question. After 10 minutes of being
attacked non-stop (there must have been something that just attacked monsters to me) I was
getting really tired of the whole ordeal when I remembered that I had just learned gate on
my last trip to town. Unfortunately for me, in order to keep myelf alive for the full 10
minutes of bombardment I had to use almost every ounce of Mana on my person.</p>

<p>So after another 20 minutes of being attacked, and trying very hard not to use any
spells, I finally got enough mana to gate back to the entrance to Halas. I shrudder to
think how long I would have had to sit there if I hadn't had that spell.</p>

<p>I was a level 17 ranger, loving life with my new dual wield. I was about to leave
Freeport on a trip to Queynos. I hadn't been there since I was a kid(level 7) and was
looking forward to going to try some quests there (I wanted trumpy's head). As I was
finishing checking to see that I didn't have too much stuff I didn't need(with banded I
got 10lbs spare for carrying). A nice looking High Elf Cleric approaches me and asks how
to get to South Freeport(I was in west). I told her there wan't any, and asked her
destination. She said she was looking for Karana. I offered to take her as I was going
that way my self, and she gladly accepted. We made our way through the commons, I camoed
her as we went through W Commons, braving the threat of kodiaks and Griffins in for the
sake of protecting my charge(I take it very seriously). We made it through HP with only a
minor skuffle with an orc, and headed down the gorge in North Karana. I told her she was
in Karana, and asked where she wanted to go. She said she didn't know since this was her
first trip to Atonica(odd, she was a level above me...). I offered to take her to Queynos
with me. We quickly made for the bridge, I told her to RUN if I got attacked, especially
if the Evil Eye got me(that charm is a beioch), but he never even made an appearance.</p>

<p>(wait for it, it's coming)</p>

<p>Well after the bridge we were heading along the river, and I stopped to point out the
one hazard, the small group of Raiders camped on the banks. They were green as hell to me,
but the casters can still be nasty.</p>

<p>You have entered North Karana</p>

<p>I had one bubble of health left</p>

<p>She had tried walking right in the middle of the camp, the women are Druids, the men
are Wizards, and all 8 were casters. All 8 hit her at once, she died instantly.</p>

<p>You tell Ignorantcleric: Damn that sucked, but I barely made it<br>
You tell Ignorantcleric: Where where you bound at?</p>

<p>Ignorantcleric tells you: Oh no, I am bound in Unrest!<br>
<br>
DOH!</p>

<p>I died to a griffawn trying to get back to her in freeport to lead her, then crashed.
When I got back on she had her corpse, and made it to Queynos already. I finally
remembered why her name was familiar, I had seen her in Unrest several times. Last I heard
she was havin fun in S Karana, having remembered to bind herself this time. I wasn't so
lucky, I lost my level to that Griff, and spent the next day getting it back. Did I
mention I was bound in Freeport when I died?</p>

<p>..sigh..</p>

<p>that's what I get for being helpful.<br>

<p>Recently a litte tired of getting XP and loot, and quite frankly sick of all the people
/auctioning mindnumbing qualities of this and that I decided to have a little fun and test
the manual dexerity of some of my fellow players. I created a char called
&quot;Myuisnyiznsjqisil&quot; and proceded to run around gfay zone /auction'ing FBR

<p>The level 9 wizard that i am was killed in BlackBurrow, by a giant snake. I thought I
could handle it but finally couldn't. Now, spawning back in Qeynos, I always like to exact
a little revenge on the newbie<br>
beasties... I try to do fancy tricks, like, root, fade, then approach and kill the mob
with numbing cold (level 1 area effect centered on caster). So, well, i kill one beastie,
then zone to Qeynos hills. Here's what followed:<br>

The damn guard walked right in my area effect spell, then killed me. NPC noto-killers :)
