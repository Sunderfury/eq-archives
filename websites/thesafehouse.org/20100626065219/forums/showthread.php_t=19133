<i>'I'm screwed.'</i> She felt almost as vulnerable and helpless as the day she first arrived, when she had triggered the collar while trying to escape.  <i>'I won't let him see my fear'</i> she promised herself.  <i>'Even if he presses the button I won't show fear, because that's exactly what he wants.'</i>  She knew all she had to do was stall, buy some time for Madison to come back with Charles.  She had to get him talking.  &quot;So, what happens now?&quot; She asked, regaining her composure. &quot;You can't just kill me without some sort of explanation to Charles.  I mean, he did go through all the trouble to get me here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know.  I'm thinking of throwing you in the pool and activating the collar.  It'll look like an unfortunate drowning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn't work.  I told Charles I don't like water.  He wouldn't believe I'd get in the pool in the first place, plus the collar malfunctioning might put Crey in a bad light - you wouldn't want that.&quot;  A way to stall Nick came to her, but it would be tricky to get him to agree.  She didn't have any other options so she went for it.  &quot;I've got an idea.  If I disappeared without a trace, you could just say I escaped.  You wouldn't need to explain anything, and it's not like I haven't spent every day here thinking about how to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could work. Yeah, it's believable and simple.  I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now was the tricky part.  &quot;And you don't even have to kill me&quot; Cathy added.  &quot;You could have me sent off to a Crey research facility instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick gave her a look that told her he wasn't buying it. <i>'Crap, he's not buying it. Sell it to him Cathy.  If you want to live, make him believe you.'</i>  &quot;Listen,&quot; she replied. &quot;I'm just trying to save my life here.  I know you hold all the cards and if I do something stupid I'm a gonner.  There have got to be Crey scientists wanting to poke and prod a real life mutant, and a mutant hero no less!  You want to be an important person in Crey, and I want to live.  It's a win-win situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose so.  I could arrange for a transport team.  Maybe get them to rough me up a bit and I could tell Charles I tried to stop you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!  Even Charles would thank you for trying to stop me from escaping. Oh, but there's one problem.  You'd have to remove the collar around my neck or they wouldn't believe I escaped.  You do have the key, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The look Nick gave her told her that he didn't have the key.  His superiors trusted him enough to give him a remote that would make it easy to kill her, but not enough to give him a key that would allow her to escape.  Cathy glanced at the open door, wondering what was taking Madison so long.  She should have been back with Charles by now.  Nick noticed her glance.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not expecting Charles to walk through that door and rescue you, are you?  He's not here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, why? Where is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He went to meet with some high level Crey executives.  He's probably signing away his entire business empire as we speak.  Crey is buying Charles' company and all its subsidiaries in one lump sum, and the deal should be inked today. The tech guys have been drooling over several of his patents for years now, and they'll finally be able to put them to good use... thanks to you, Cathy.  Or should I say thanks to Cynthia?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy remembered Charles' words to her.  <i>'I would give up my empire to have you back.  If I had you and Madison and not a penny to my name, I would be a happy man.'</i>  Charles was selling his business empire to Crey because he thought she was Cynthia.  He wanted to spend the rest of his life with her and Madison, without the distraction of running an empire.  This wasn't as much about Nightprowl getting too close to a Crey conspiracy as it was a matter of a billion dollar business deal.  Cathy was a 'perk' given to Charles as a reason to sell.<br />
<br />
Nick continued &quot;So you, me, and Madison are the only ones here.  Where is the little freak anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
With the knowledge that a rescue wasn't coming, Cathy's priorities began to change.  She needed to protect Madison.  She sat down on the edge of the bed.  &quot;I'll do what you want, just don't hurt Madison.  I won't say anything to her about you and I'll even tell her I'm leaving to make your escape story more believable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beg me&quot; he replied with an evil grin.  He was relishing the control he had over Cathy.  &quot;I want to see 'The Daring Nightprowl' reduced to begging me to spare the life of a fellow freak.&quot;  Cathy closed her eyes, gritted her teeth, and gulped down her pride.  &quot;I'm begging you. Please don't hurt Madison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; Nick replied casually.  &quot;Just because you asked so nicely, I won't hurt her.&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn't believe one syllable of his reply.  She knew he was all about showing his boss how good of an employee he was, and the only thing better than capturing a mutant was capturing two mutants.  She couldn't let that happen to Madison; she was too young and too precious to be locked away as a test subject.  She eyed the remote in his hand; that was the key to getting out of this mess.  If she could take it from him she'd have no problem beating him in a fair fight.  &quot;And the team that comes to take me away won't hurt her either?  You promise?  Cross your heart?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Nick nodded his head and raised up his free hand, making a cross over his heart. &quot;I promise Madison won't be harm...&quot;  In mid-sentence Cathy made her move, bolting straight for him in a flash.  As her hand touched the remote control, her fingers sliding in between the plastic and Nick's hand to pop it loose, she thought she'd been fast enough to close the gap before he could react.  But before the remote broke free her body shut down and she fell past him, slamming against the wall with a crash.  &quot;WHOA!&quot; Nick exclaimed, jumping back in excitement. &quot;You almost got me there!  Nice try!&quot;  He was now in complete control and he knew it.<br />
<br />
He grabbed Cathy's leg and dragged her into an open space in the room, laying her flat on her back. He walked around her body, using his foot to slide her legs together and her arms to her side, circling her and watching Cathy track his movement with her eyes, with hatred in those eyes, unable to lift a finger. Cathy saw the cold look on his face and knew his mind was made up.  &quot;You're too much trouble to keep alive.  I'm just going to kill you now, then call for a team to pick up your dead body.  I think I'm gonna cut off your tail though, to keep as a trophy.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'Don't show fear.  Don't show fear'</i> Cathy repeated to herself.<br />
<br />
Nick began going over the week's events in his mind. &quot;All that idiot Charles had to do was make you take the drug&quot; he said, kneeling down over her helpless body. &quot;You would've believed every word of his mindless blabbering without question.  About how you were his dead wife, and that that monsterous freakgirl was your daughter. But no, he had to be difficult.  Almost as difficult as you. You could have been happy, living the life of luxury, but now I have to kill you, and with that collar around your neck you won't be able to do a thing to stop me.&quot;  Nick slowly wrapped his hands around Cathy's neck and started squeezing, choking the life out of her.  She struggled for a breath that wasn't coming, and her vision  blurred.<br />
<br />
Cathy began to black out when she heard Madison's voice. &quot;LEAVE MY MOMMY ALONE!&quot; Madison bared her teeth and claws and lept for Nick, latching herself onto his back and sinking her teeth into his ear, severing it at the lobe.  Nick screamed and twisted, throwing her into the corner, but Madison bounced off the wall and landed in a crouch, her eyes fixed on her prey and not an ounce of fear in her body.  Cathy was in a panic, gulping for breath, unable to do anything to help her, knowing that Madison wasn't strong enough to fight Nick.  Nick held the side of his bloodied head and grimaced.  With a hoarse, raspy voice she pleaded to Madison. &quot;Run!  Please run!  Go into the woods and hide until daddy gets home!&quot; With both Simon and Charles gone she needed to convince Madison to save herself. She began swearing at Nick, trying to get his attention off Madison and back onto her.  <br />
<br />
After several frantic moments a deep, throaty roar filled the room. Nick turned towards the sound and his eyes bulged at the sight of a 400 pound african lion blocking the only exit to the room.  &quot;Stay back! Stay back!&quot; Nick threatened, his eyes darting around for an escape route.  He picked up his laptop and threw it at the large window.  Shards of glass exploded outward on impact.  He jumped through the opening and out onto the lawn, then ran as fast as he could.  Zeus loped into the room, followed by Magick who had been just outside the door as well. <i>'Of course'</i> thought Cathy. <i>'In Madison's mind Zeus is just as much a member of her family as Charles or Simon.  When Madison couldn't find them, she brought back Zeus.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Madison, sweetie, you did great&quot; Cathy told her in sore, broken voice.  She still couldn't move, and knew she wouldn't be able to until the collar was reset.  Cathy ordered Zeus to grab her arm with his teeth and slowly drag her back to her room, and they began the journey, with Zeus slowly backing his way down the hall and Magick and Madison watching intently. Cathy could see the concern in Madison's eyes as she walked slowly beside her, and was able to offer words of support and a much needed smile. &quot;Everything's going to be okay now, sweetie&quot; Cathy promised.<br />
<br />
They made slow but steady progress through the manor, trying to get back to Cathy's room but careful not to hurt her in the process. The group was on the final stretch to their destination when they heard Simon's voice.  &quot;Milady!&quot; he exclaimed, rushing to her side.  Cathy looked up at him and noticed he had a nasty gash on his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're okay!&quot; she smiled, relieved that Nick's henchmen had been as successful in dealing with Simon as Nick had been in dealing with her.  &quot;I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you in danger.  It's my fault you were attacked. Nick has been spying for Crey, and I told him you were bringing back a tape that would prove I wasn't Cynthia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That explains what those ruffians were talking about&quot; Simon commented, remembering back to their threats before he was forced to defend himself.  Simon picked up Cathy and carried her to her room.  &quot;While I'm not a fighter of your calibre milady, I do know how to defend myself.  After I was attacked I was able to contact Mr. Monroe's security force - they're bringing him back to the estate as we speak.  I'll search his office to see if I can find what we need to get your collar off.&quot;  He laid Cathy on her bed and turned to Madison.  &quot;Miss Madison, please stay here, and make sure Zeus and Magick stay here as well.  If anything bad happens, they'll protect you.&quot;  Simon left for Charles' office, leaving Cathy with Madison and the two cats.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so proud of you, sweetie&quot; Cathy told Madison.  &quot;You were so brave!&quot;  Madison's eyes teared up, causing her's to do the same, and when Madison leaned in and gave her a hug it crushed Cathy inside that she couldn't hug her back. She patiently tried squeezing her hand into a fist, getting no response the first few times, but when she felt her hand close she knew she'd regained her movement.  She immediately held Madison in her arms, kissed her on her forehead, then said &quot;We have to get going now - this isn't over yet and I don't want you to get hurt, okay?&quot;  Madison nodded, and the four of them headed off to Charles' office.<br />
<br />
<br />
***2***<br />
<br />
<br />
Simon and Cathy rummaged through Charles' office without success, and after they had gone over every inch of the room they concluded the key must be in his safe.  They were regrouping, trying to decide what to do next when Madison looked down the hallway.  Charles was striding towards the room.  He had four security guards on each side. &quot;Daddy!&quot;  She yelled happily, leaping out of the room and jumped into Charles' arms.  &quot;What's going on here?&quot; he asked, noting the obvious intrusion into his office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you sell your company?&quot; Cathy immediately asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I was about to, but I got a call... wait, how did you know? It was going to be a surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't sell.  This whole thing was to get you to sell your company to them.&quot;  She looked at Simon.  &quot;Simon, I need to talk to Charles alone.  Could you look after Madison and the cats?  Take a couple of Charles' security guards too, just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes milady.&quot;  He turned to Madison.  &quot;Miss Madison, would you like to help me fix this cut?&quot;  He asked, pointing to the gash on his forehead.  She nodded and Simon, Madison, Zeus, and Magick left the room accompanied by two of Charles' security guards.  With a look Cathy was able to tell Charles that 'alone' meant without the remainder of his security force.  &quot;Wait outside&quot; he said to them, closing the door to his office.<br />
<br />
Cathy decided not to beat around the bush.  &quot;I'm not Cynthia&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, just give it some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you don't understand; I was never Cynthia. Crey lied to you to get me off the trail of finding my friend, and to get you to sell your company to them.  This whole thing was a sham.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles looked at Cathy in disbelief. &quot;But... you can't know that for certain...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charles, I was almost killed today.  Look at my neck&quot; Cathy replied, showing Charles the bruising, which had already reddened and was on its way to a purple hue.  &quot;And so was Simon.  I bluffed Nick into believing I had proof I wasn't Cynthia and Simon was returning with the evidence.  He had his henchmen attack Simon to destroy the evidence.  Crey Industries has been lying to you, and Nick has been spying for them all along. He sabotaged the combat suit project so he could keep tabs on me while I was being drugged, but when you decided to give me a choice of whether or not to take the drug, he started spiking my drinks.  His job was to make sure I believed what you told me.  I'm not your wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are. You have to be. The DNA test proved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I told you before, you can't trust Crey.  They must've altered the test.  I'm not her. Charles, you have to let me go.  Up until now you've been used by Crey Industries, but if you continue to hold me against my will you'll be committing a serious crime.  With what Simon now knows, I don't think he'll agree with you keeping me here.  I'm telling you this because we also need to tell Madison.  She has to know I'm not her mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.  I have to think about it.&quot; Charles waivered. No matter what Cathy could say, Charles couldn't help but see Cynthia in her eyes.  It had been five long, painful years that had come to an end when she was brought to the manor.  <i>'I need her'</i> he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Cathy took his hand in hers to get his undivided attention. &quot;Please, Charles.  Some very bad men are most certainly arranging an attack on this place as we speak.  If I still have this collar around my neck they're going to turn me off as easily as a light switch.  They'll kill me, they'll kill you, they'll kill Simon, and they <b>will</b> kill Madison.  You have a skeleton crew security force who won't be able to hold them off for long.  I can. Stopping people like these is my job, and it's a job I do very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy could see the pain in Charles' eyes, his mind weighing his selfish needs against what was the right thing to do.  He walked over to his office safe and spun in the combination.  After opening the door he reached in for an object then closed the safe and turned to Cathy.  He stepped in close to her.  &quot;Please turn around&quot; he said with sorrow in his voice, and Cathy did.  He placed his hand softly on her shoulder and held up the object from the safe, a unique key.  As he brought it close to the collar one of the rubies responded to its presence, flipping open to reveal a lock.  He paused for a moment, fixated on the back of Cathy's neck, her delicate shoulders, the smell of her hair.  He leaned in and fought back the urge to whisper that he loved her, before pushing the key into the lock.  The collar sprung open from the back and gravity took effect, dropping it to the floor with a thud.<br />
<br />
She turned to face him and saw his doubt, the fear that he'd just made a huge mistake.  With a soothing voice she thanked him and told him he made the right choice.  Now it was time to talk to Madison.  It was a hard conversation for them to get through.  In the beginning Madison didn't take it well, thinking that it must be a matter of Cathy not <i>wanting</i> to be her mother.  &quot;Oh sweetie, it doesn't work that way&quot; Cathy replied.  &quot;I love you so much that I want you to know the truth, even if it makes me sad inside that I can't call you my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy saw Madison's doubt and offered up the explanation Cathy had come to after finding out she wasn't Madison's mother.  &quot;You know what I think?  I think that your mommy loves you very much, and she guided me here to help you, because she can't come back from where she is now and because you and I are so much alike.&quot; Cathy smiled and winked, and playfully brushed the end of her tail against Madison's nose.  A small smile crept into Madison's lips.  The bond between Cathy and Madison only seemed to strengthen; it was something neither could explain and now that they knew they weren't mother and daughter it seemed all the more perplexing.<br />
<br />
When Cathy was satisfied that Madison was happy and everything that needed to be said was out in the open, she began thinking about a defense plan.  She knew it wouldn't be in Nick's nature to simply run away and accept defeat. &quot;What I wouldn't give for my costume right now&quot; she muttered, knowing that against many lesser opponents intimidation was just as effective as a boot in the face.  She glanced over at Charles and his sheepish look told her that he was hiding something.  &quot;Don't tell me you took one of my costumes?&quot; she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly&quot; he replied.  They left Madison with Simon, and Charles led Cathy back to his office.  He opened the safe once more and pressed a button located on the back panel.  One of the bookcases responded by sliding open.  As Cathy moved towards the secret opening Charles stopped her. &quot;Wait.  Before you go in there, you have to know that I was obsessed with you.  Maybe I still am.  But I just want you to know...&quot; he stammered to find the right words.  &quot;I don't know.  Cynthia meant so much to me.  It hurt so much when I lost her, and it still hurts.  And in you I found I could be with her again.  I just want you to know that I'm a good person on the inside.  I'm sorry for what you'll see in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy followed Charles into the room and was greeted with a monument to Cathy Watts, and to Nightprowl.  Thousands of photographs of her covered every inch of one wall, and more pictures spilled out onto the adjacent walls as if they were a fungus, slowing growing to covered the whole room.  Photographs of Nightprowl jumping through the city and fighting bad guys, and photos of Cathy grocery shopping or simply walking down the street.  There were a few photos of Cathy inside her apartment, apparently taken from the building across the street.  Nothing revealing, but still disturbing.  The room had a single chair and a small side table placed prominently in the center.  The only other furnishing was a glass display case about seven feet high.  Inside a mannequin was dressed in a costume Cathy didn't recognize; it had a dark red abdomen and dark red fists which faded into black limbs, and had three dark red barbs off each forearm.  A pullover mask integrated into the suit hid the wearer's identity.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew eventually you'd want to go back to Paragon City - you've done too much good there to not want to go back. I just hoped that you'd have stayed here a little longer.&quot;  His sad face told her that he knew that wasn't going to happen.  &quot;This is my gift to you; a new Nightprowl costume.  It has integrated shin guards for your foot attacks, those barbs can be used to trap and deflect melee weapons, and the entire suit is made from a lightweight breatheable fabric that's resistant to small calibre bullets and shrapnel.  It also integrates your communication equipment with a satellite phone so you will always be able to get a connection, and adds a PDA in your wrist to keep any other information you may need.  I want you to have it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy decided not to bring up the wall of pictures.  She knew he was obsessed, and the wall was just further confirmation to his obsession.  She would confront him with it later. She opened up the front of the case and inspected the costume, running her fingers down the fabric. &quot;Wow, I don't know what to say... thank you, Charles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy changed into her new costume and began to stretch her body.  She twisted and turned, crouched and lept, testing the suit's limitations and finding that it fit perfectly. She pulled the mask over her head.  She was <a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org/users/ruccus/CityofHeroes/NightprowlNew.JPG" target="_blank">Nightprowl</a> once more.<br />
<br />
<br />
***3***<br />
<br />
<br />
Nightprowl crouched low on the roof of the manor, scanning the surrounding area for movement.  All the exterior lights on the estate had been turned off as per her instructions, and with her dark costume and complete stillness, she was nearly invisible. <i>'Hurry up Nick, my dinner's getting cold'</i> she thought to herself.  At that moment Charles, Madison, and Simon were eating dinner in the dining room, guarded by Charles' security force.  &quot;Under no circumstances is anyone to leave the manor&quot; she told them; she didn't want to have to worry about anyone getting hurt by a stray bullet.  A flashlight beam off in the distance ended the waiting game and Nightprowl lept a high arc, landing with a soft thud only yards from where she spotted the beam.<br />
<br />
Motion and a light off to her right guided her to her target. She shook her head; this was going to be easy. Within seconds she found the Crey assault team, and quick one-two combination of covering the mouth while striking the head just right had knocked out the trailing member of the team.  A repeat of the procedure brought down another, again without a sound to be heard.  The team appeared to consist of only six more members and Cathy suspected that there must be more than one assault team; Nick knew the size of Charles' security force and would at least double its number even if he thought she was still wearing the collar.<br />
<br />
She followed them for a moment, picking up information about the rest of the team. The leader had a headset on and the three closest to him were dressed in Crey security uniforms.  The two in the front appeared to be locals, maybe guides hired to lead the team through the wilderness.  Nightprowl lept into the group consisting of the leader and three Crey employees, and with a leg sweep they were all defenseless.  Less than three seconds later they were all unconscious.<br />
<br />
This time the attack wasn't silent, and the two locals turned around to find their group wiped out and a dark figure crouched over their bodies.  Nightprowl slowly raised up and twisted her arms, revealing her red forearm barbs.  The closest guide took a step back, bumping into his friend and falling to the ground.  Nightprowl remained still, silent, letting their own imagination terrify themselves for her.<br />
<br />
The second was still standing, frozen in fear.  Nightprowl did nothing to reveal herself as being anything other than a silent monster who had just wiped out a group of heavily armed soldiers.  The one on the ground kept moving away, crawling backwards on his hands and heels.  &quot;El Ch- Chup- Chupacabra!&quot; he finally spat from his mouth, turning and scrambling to his feet.  The second guide finally began to move, knowing if he didn't, the monster in front of him would kill him and eat him, just like what would surely be the fate of the others at the monster's feet.  They both fled through the brush, breaking twigs and branches as they ran.<br />
<br />
<i>'El Chupacabra'</i> Nightprowl grinned. A creature who preys on livestock, sucking out the blood and mutilating the bodies.  Like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster it's never actually confirmed to exist.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl turned her attention to the headset on the group's fallen leader.  She put it on and listened, then began walking in the direction the team had been travelling.  She soon came to a clearing which overlooked the west side of the manor. <i>'This must be from where they were going to begin the attack'</i> she thought.  A voice sounded over the radio.  It appeared to be the leader of the operation, but it wasn't Nick.  Nightprowl didn't care about these men, he wanted Nick.  <i>'Where is the bastard?'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;This is Wolf One Leader. All teams report.&quot; sounded the voice on the headset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolf One Leader, this is Wolf Two Leader.  We're in position to the north.  Over&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolf Four here.  We're just setting up.  We'll be in the southern position momentarily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence filled the air as one of the teams failed to respond. &quot;Wolf Three Leader, what's your status?&quot;  Nothing.  &quot;Dammit, Wolf Three is having radio trouble.  Wolf Two, do you have line of sight to their rallying point?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. It's empty. No, wait.  I see something.  I don't think it's ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl's voice sounded over the radio.  It was confident, with a hit of a taunt. &quot;Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolves?  'Not I' says Nightprowl.  This is your last chance boys.  Tuck your tails between your legs and run for home before you get hurt.  You are seriously overmatched.  I'll be seen when I want to be seen, and disappear when I don't.&quot;  Nightprowl took to the air, aiming for team two's position in one gigantic leap.<br />
<br />
In mid-air she called out over the headset &quot;Wolf Two, you don't see me any more, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... no.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a soft thud she landed in the middle of the group, and a quick leg sweep downed four of them. &quot;I'm right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wolf One Leader heard staccato gunfire open up from Wolf Two's position, and bright flashes filled the trees and lit up the night sky.  The battle appeared to last mere seconds before Nightprowl's voice boomed angrily over the radio.  &quot;YOU'RE ALL SHEEP!  I'M THE WOLF HERE!  Sheep Four - you're next. Drop your weapons and run, while you still have a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolf Four, hold your position!&quot; shouted Wolf One Leader.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl watched three of Wolf Two's members drop their weapons and scamper away; the other five were unconscious at her feet.  When she was sure the runners wouldn't be coming back she took to the air once again, landing on the southern roof of the manor with a good view of several people running away.  Nightprowl spoke into the headset once more. &quot;They're running away Sheep Leader, and I don't think they're coming back.  They made the right choice - will you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to finish the job I was instructed to do. I'm going to kill you, Nightprowl&quot; Wolf One Leader fumed over the airwaves.<br />
<br />
He was still waiting for Nightprowl's response when he heard noise from behind.  He turned to find Nightprowl standing four feet away, the remnants of his team unconscious in her wake.  The team leader's eyes widened and he knew he wouldn't be able to aim and fire his assault rifle before Nightprowl attacked, so he dropped his weapon.  &quot;I surrender! I surrender!&quot; he pleaded.  &quot;They made me do this! I had no choice! Please, don't kill me!  You have to help me, you're a hero!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl was wary of his sudden change in demeanor. &quot;How did they make you arrange an attack on this estate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over there&quot; he pointed, trying to lead Nightprowl's focus away from his right hand, the hand which was reaching back for the pistol nestled in his waistband.  He had barely pulled the gun free when Nightprowl spun in close, grabbing his outstretched hand and reaching around to grab the wrist of his right hand with her left. She squeezed his wrist until the weapon dropped to the ground.  Nightprowl couldn't resist the urge to pull his hips into hers in a dancer's pose, showing him that she was in control. He was back on his heels and had one arm pinned awkwardly behind him.  He was in no position to do anything but listen.  Nightprowl leaned her chin on his shoulder and whispered into his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to let you go in a minute, but first you're going to listen to me&quot; she said.  &quot;Your first mistake was trying to sneak up on a cat in the dark.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  At least in daylight you wouldn't have been at such a disadvantage.  Your second mistake was not bringing enough men.  I'll chalk that one up to Nick hoping that I still had the collar around my neck, because the number of men you brought was rather insulting. Your third, and biggest, mistake was that you tried to hurt my friends.  That makes me very angry, and when I'm angry I tend to do things I wouldn't normally do - very unpleasant things.<br />
<br />
Now you're going to leave, and tomorrow I want to see Nick in his shiny new combat suit.  You know, the one he stole from Charles.  Maybe he'll do better than you did, but I doubt it.  One more thing; I want you to give Nick a message...&quot;  With that she yanked up hard on his right hand, dislocating his shoulder with a sickening pop.  He let out a piercing scream and twisted away.  &quot;Now run, before I <i>really</i> hurt you, you bastard!&quot;  Nightprowl watched him stagger away in pain, and after he was well on his way Nightprowl keyed the headset one last time.  &quot;Nick, I know you've been listening over the radio the whole time.  You've always wanted to prove that you could beat a hero, haven't you?  Now's your chance.  I'll see you tomorrow if you're man enough. You against me, at high noon, just like an old fashioned gunfight.  Don't be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seconds of silence were ended with Nick's voice.  &quot;I'll be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***4***<br />
<br />
<br />
Cathy pulled back her mask as she walked down the hallway. It had been too long since she had tangled with bad guys and she was still riding an adrenaline high.  After instructing Charles' security to turn on the lights and round up the unconscious men and weaponry that were strewn across the estate, she walked into the dining room.  They had all finished dinner, and Charles was reading Madison a story.  Madison was blinking back her sleepiness in an effort to stay awake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi sweetie, you look tired.  Let's go get you into your PJs, then you can go to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison rubbed her eyes and held out her arms, waiting for Cathy to lift her up.  Cathy lifted her up and with a weary voice Madison asked &quot;Are those your PJs?&quot;, noting the costume Cathy was wearing.<br />
<br />
Cathy gave a small chuckle and replied &quot;Well, I guess these will be my PJs for tonight.  So, do you want to sleep in my room tonight, with Zeus and Magick too?&quot;  This wasn't a question more than a statement of what was going to happen, as although Cathy thought she had bought them a respite from attack until noon the next day, she wasn't going to take any chances.  Forming it into a question allowed Madison to think they were doing something as a treat instead of as a security measure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh&quot; she replied, resting her head on Cathy's shoulder and falling into a light sleep.  Zeus and Magick followed them around the manor as Cathy prepared Madison for bed.  They seemed to know exactly what their duty was for that day: protect Madison.  Cathy tucked Madison in for the night and said a few words of thanks to Zeus and Magick as they settled onto her bed as well, before arranging to have two more security guards stand watch at her bedroom door. Now it was time to check on the prisoners.<br />
<br />
She pulled her mask over her eyes and entered the cats' room, checking on the conversions which transformed it into a holding cell.  The door to the back tunnel had been closed and locked, and the code to the door at the front had been changed; 1-2-3-4 may be fine for a luggage combination, but not for tonight. Sixteen prisoners were being held in the cell, and the two captured team leaders had earned places in Zeus and Magick's travel cages to avoid them trying to arrange a breakout before the local authorities could pick them up.<br />
<br />
When Nightprowl entered, the room got quiet.  With one of the security guards translating for those who didn't speak english, she began to address her captive audience in a cold, calculating tone.  &quot;I chose to spare each and every one of you tonight out of the goodness of my heart.  If you choose to co-operate with the local authorities you will not be prosecuted. You can go back to your families, hug your loved ones... whatever, I don't care.  Your mission leader wasn't so lucky - in my mind I can still hear him begging for his life and screaming in pain as I ripped him limb from limb. If ANYONE tries ANYTHING stupid tonight they WILL be begging me to spare their life, and they WILL be screaming in pain.  I will snap your neck like a twig if I even THINK that you might be trying something stupid.  I've used up all my patience today and the night's still young, so don't make me regret not killing each and every one of you, because I can always change my mind.&quot;  The looks on their faces told Nightprowl she had hit the right tone - absolute terror.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl ordered the guards to sleep in shifts; there would be four of them in the room watching over the prisoners, and two more manning the security center which had cameras scanning the exterior as well as some of the interior, including Cathy's room as well as Zeus and Magick's room.<br />
<br />
She pulled off her mask and Cathy walked back to the dining room to finally eat dinner, and to wind down from the evening's events. Charles was waiting patiently for her.  &quot;I can't believe how many people are in the cats' room.  Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm fine.  Except for the live ammunition, it wasn't more than a light workork for me.  I expect Nick will make his move tomorrow, so we should be okay tonight.  What can you tell me about the combat suit your company has been developing? Are there any glaring weaknesses, or issues that have come up in tests?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles tried his best to describe the suit and its abilities so that Cathy knew what to expect when Nick came for her the next day.  When she finished eating dinner she decided it was time to tell Charles what was going to happen now that they knew she wasn't Cynthia.  &quot;Charles, we need to discuss what's going to happen next. You abducted me against my will, and regardless of your intentions, it was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon started to leave the room but Cathy stopped him. &quot;No, Simon.  You stay.  I want you to hear this too.&quot;  She turned to Charles.  &quot;Charles, I want you to see a psychiatrist.  You need to tell him about me, about Cynthia, and about your feelings for both of us.  You need to deal with her death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I know you're not her now!  I'm okay, really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charles, you had someone spying on me long before you were tricked into believing I was Cynthia.  You have a secret room in your office devoted to pictures of me.  That's not healthy.  Are you still going to have someone follow me to take pictures for when you get the urge to see Cynthia again?  I honestly do believe that I was guided here for Madison's benefit, to be the motherly figure she needs in her life, but if you can't get some professional help to guide you through your emotions when I'm with you and Madison... well, I'll be forced to remove myself from her life for good.&quot;  Cathy knew it was a cold bluff, when she first laid eyes on Madison she knew that they would be a part of each other's lives for a long time, but she hoped that Charles wouldn't want to risk it.<br />
<br />
Her words echoed through Charles' mind, and for the first time he realized she wasn't simply going to leave them as he had feared.  He quietly nodded, afraid that if he said the wrong thing she might change her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also want Madison to go to school; I don't want her to be home schooled just because she's different from most other kids.  She needs to learn to make friends, and to know that there are people out there who won't judge her by her outward appearance.  Finally, if I call you and say that 'I want to see Madison now', I expect that by the time I've packed and arrived at the airport there'll be a plane ticket waiting for me.  I don't care if you're on the other side of the world in an important business meeting; if I want to see Madison you'll make sure it happens, no exceptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles had trouble hiding his happiness.  While Cathy noticed, she wasn't about to confront him with it; hopefully in time his psychiatrist would be able to sort out his emotions. He agreed to all her conditions without question.<br />
<br />
Cathy then turned to trying to contact Gerald; Charles showed her how to work the satellite phone in her new costume, but Gerald's cellphone was unavailable.  With Charles' boast of being able to contact anyone from anywhere on earth, he nervously suggested that it must be Gerald who was out of range of a cell phone tower.  A second call to GIFT got the after hours service, and after leaving a message her third call was to Gerald's hotel.  He wasn't in his room but she left a message that she was okay and she'd try again later.<br />
<br />
Her last call was to the Paragon City Police Deparment, where she awkwardly asked if there was an open 'missing persons' case regarding her disappearance.  She talked with the detective in charge and after skirting around the issue of laws Charles broke in abducting her, she suggested it was simply a case of a hero doing her duty in an abstract manner.  After all, she had saved Charles from selling his company to Crey and discovered that Trish was alive and was being held by Crey Industries.  Trish would be the next mission on her list, and hopefully after capturing Nick, Cathy would have enough information to track down where she was being held.  But that was for tomorrow; right now she was tired and needed some sleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
***5***<br />
<br />
<br />
Curled on her side beside Madison, Cathy dreamed peacefully.  She dreamed that she was sleeping in her bed in Paragon City, when she heard Gerald's voice.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Cathy, wake up&quot; Gerald said<br />
<br />
She rolled over and was nose to chin with Gerald.  She smiled at the thought of Gerald in her bed and ran her hand across his chest. &quot;I'm awake&quot; she lazily replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Cat, wake up&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy curled her head into his chest and felt at complete peace.  She let out a soft sigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy, I just called you 'Cat'... what do you think about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
A sly grin grew across her face and she looked up at him. &quot;Meow.&quot;  Her hand slid under the covers and she caressed Gerald's body. &quot;What do you think about this?&quot; she answered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy, I'm trying to wake you up.  You're still dreaming.  Wake up!  I'm really here!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Cathy opened her eyes.  Madison was curled in a ball beside her, and Zeus and Magick were crowded onto the bed as well.  Cathy raised her head and looked around.  Charles and Simon were both sleeping on the floor, and two silhouettes stood in the doorway.  &quot;Gerry? Is that you?&quot; Cathy called out, still only half awake.<br />
<br />
Gerald's voice filled her mind. &quot;Shhh. Jack and I have come to rescue you. We're getting you out of here.&quot;  Cathy slid out of the bed and approached Gerry. She touched his face and looked into his tired and weary eyes.  He was real.  She leaned in and kissed him deeply, longingly, and wrapped her arms around him.  Gerald gave in and kissed her back, so happy that he'd found her and she was safe.  Gerald regained control of his emotions and broke the kiss. &quot;We have to leave before the guards wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what did you do to the guards?  They're on our side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We knocked them out... what do you mean 'they're on our side'?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked at the group sleeping in her room, then at Gerald.  &quot;It's complicated.  I've been well taken care of here and we'll go home tomorrow, but no more hurting anybody, okay?&quot;  Cathy touched Gerald's unshaven chin.  &quot;You need a shave&quot; she noted, and couldn't help but give him another light kiss on the lips.<br />
<br />
Jack interrupted their reunion. &quot;Hey kitten... no kiss for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jack. No, you don't get a kiss. And don't call me kitten.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy woke up Simon to tell him that Jack and Gerald were here and that she would show them to an adjacent guest room, but Simon insisted that that was his job.  Simon reminded her that she needed her rest because Nick would be there tomorrow and if she wasn't properly rested she might make a mistake that could cost her dearly.  Cathy reluctantly slipped back into her bed while Simon woke up and prepared rooms for both Jack and Gerald.  Cathy spent the next hour watching the clock tick off each minute and watching Madison sleep.  She knew that she needed sleep, but she wanted to see Gerald too.  She slipped out of bed and after telling the guards where she was going, she walked to his door and quietly opened it.  &quot;Gerry?&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Gerry, are you awake?&quot;  Her eyes adjusted to the darkness and she could see Gerald soundly asleep in the bed.  <i>'He must be so tired'</i> she thought.  She saw the stubble on his face and wondered how long it had been since he'd last shaved.  Cathy undressed, shedding her Nightprowl costume, then slid under the covers beside him.  He was warm and comforting.  She laid her head gently on his chest and his rythmic breathing rocked her to sleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
***6***<br />
<br />
<br />
When Gerald awoke in the morning he found that he wasn't alone; Cathy had slipped into his bed in the middle of the night and was nuzzling against his chest.  <i>'I could really get used to this'</i> he thought to himself, watching her sleep.  She was purring softly, and as Gerald ran his hand through her hair Cathy awoke and her purring stopped. She looked up at him and smiled.  &quot;Good morning&quot; she said, sitting up and stretching out her arms.  Gerald scanned her bare back, from the base of her tail, up her spine and between her shoulderblades, to the back of her neck... which was purple.  &quot;Oh my god, Cathy! What happened to your neck?&quot; he exclaimed, seeing the deep purple and black bruising from where Nick had strangled her.<br />
<br />
She touched it and winced a bit from its tenderness.  &quot;Does it look bad?&quot; she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it looks bad.  How did it happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of answering, Cathy slipped out of bed and walked over to the mirror, tilting her neck and inspecting the bruising.  In the background behind her Gerald stared at her naked body, and when he caught Cathy's eyes in the mirror he quickly averted his gaze to give her some privacy.  Cathy smiled. <i>'Gerald.  Always the gentleman'</i> she thought.  She turned around and with Gerald still averting his eyes she put on his dress shirt and buttoned it up.  She sat down on the bed and put her hand on Gerald's hip.  &quot;I'm dressed, you can turn around now&quot; she said.  He turned and they both looked at each other, knowing that they cared deeply for each other.  &quot;So you came to rescue me?  Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald remembered something he wanted to give to Cathy the moment he found her, but it completely slipped his mind when he found that she wasn't in as dire a situation as he had feared.  &quot;Oh, I've got something for you in my pocket&quot; he said.  &quot;You do, do you?&quot; she replied mishieviously, completely mistunderstanding what he was trying to say. She pulled at the bedding and Gerald's eyes went wide. &quot;Hey!&quot; he exclaimed, grabbing the covers.  &quot;My pants pocket!  They're hanging on the back of the chair over there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy laughed and let go of the covers, then sauntered over to the chair.  She flicked her tail to raise the shirt and tease Gerald with a quick peek at her butt.  She felt sexy, she felt happy.  She searched the pockets and when she pulled out the item Gerald had brought with him, she was moved.  Her eyes widened and began to tear, and her mouth sagged open.  It was her collar, the one given to her by Trish and the one she rarely took off.  It had been six days since she'd worn it last, by far the longest period of time it had been off her neck since it was given to her.<br />
<br />
She hurriedly walked over to the bed, leaned into him and kissed him passionately.  &quot;I am so attracted to you right now.  I've got something to tell you, too... Trish is alive.  I've got proof - a video of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald was stunned.  &quot;What do you mean 'she's alive'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like I said.  I don't know where the video was created though, but I finally know I wasn't going nuts when I kept smelling her scent in Paragon City.  She's being held against her will by Crey Industries.  Why would they be interested in her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trish wasn't just Northern Shock - it was her experiments that enabled her to become Northern Shock.  She would probably be an asset to anyone wanting to create a superhuman.  She's alive?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  I don't know, though.&quot; Cathy replied.  &quot;The Trish I saw in the video seemed not quite there, as if she had been drugged or something.  I don't see how she could have done experiments in that condition, unless...&quot; she pushed out the thought that Trish was the test subject, not the scientist.  &quot;Nevermind.  I can't do anything about it until we get back to Paragon City, so if I keep thinking about it I'll only worry myself.&quot;  She held up her collar. &quot;Thank you so much for keeping it safe. Put it on me&quot; she said, handing it to him and turning around.  He did as she asked, and seeing the bruise on her neck once more he said &quot;You didn't tell me how you got that bruise.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'Oh, that?  I was within a few seconds of being strangled to death, that's all'</i> went through her mind, then she quickly caught herself, remembering Gerald's ability to read others' thoughts.  She looked at him and his demeanor was unchanged, so she felt secure that he chose not to invade the privacy of her mind.  &quot;I had a run-in with a bad guy while I was in a... 'disadvantageous' position.  I'll be making it up to him this afternoon, you can count on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be careful, Cat... I mean Cathy. You might be hard to hit, but you're not bullet-proof.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye-aye, Captain&quot; she said with a mock salute, trying to lighten the mood. She thought of the nickname Gerald had just used; 'Cat'.  He also used it earlier to get her attention while she was sleeping.  Trish was the only person who she'd ever let call her Cat, but it had been so long since she'd heard it and she knew that Gerald was a very important part of her life.  The way he said it also seemed so comforting to her.<br />
<br />
With an unsure voice she said &quot;You can call me 'Cat'... if you want to.&quot;  The second the words came out of her mouth she had a tinge of regret, worried that she might be betraying Trish, giving away the nickname only she was allowed to use.  Gerald knew its significance; he knew it from working at The Nightprowler.  With a name like Cathy and a catlike tail, 'Cat' was the first thing that came to most people's mind, and without exception she made sure anyone who called her 'Cat' got an unpleasant earfull.  That was until the first time he saw Cathy with Trish.  Gerald couldn't remember Trish ever calling her Cathy; it was always 'Cat', and it always seemed to make Cathy glow.<br />
<br />
Gerald didn't know what to say, and he feared the next thing that came out of his mouth would ruin the moment.  After a few seconds Cathy broke the uneasy silence.  &quot;Well, I'm going to get changed for breakfast.  Simon makes hashed browns that are out-of-this-world, you gotta try them.  The dining room is down the hall and to the right. Just follow your nose.&quot;  As she rose from the bed Gerald grabbed her hand to get her attention. He still wasn't sure what to say, but he knew he had to say something or else Cathy wouldn't know how much he appreciated the gesture. &quot;Cathy, thank you.  I know what it means to you.&quot; He let go of her hand and nervously bit his lip. Cathy smiled and nodded, and left the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
***7***<br />
<br />
<br />
She wandered back to her bedroom.  The bed was made and nobody was there, though the smell of breakfast wafting through the manor told her the reason.  She went into her closet to pick out something to wear.  She chose carefully because she knew this would also be what she was going to wear for her fight with Nick.  She needed it to be comfortable and flexible, but she wanted something that was also feminine.  She wanted Nick thinking 'I'm getting my butt kicked by a girl' instead of 'I'm getting my butt kicked by Nightprowl'.<br />
<br />
She considered a one piece swimsuit and even a bikini, but settled on a yellow sundress with a floral print. <i>'I can't get much more 'girlier' than that'</i> she thought to herself. She pirouetted in the mirror, then jumped up into a spinning kick.  <i>'This'll do nicely.'</i><br />
<br />
It was a lively breakfast, with Charles and Cathy trying to explain everything that had happened over the past week and Gerald doing likewise from his perspective.  The breakfast conversation spilled poolside, and soon Charles was off showing Jack his boats and Gerald was playing with Madison, levitating her ball high up in the air and letting her jump after it.  Cathy just relaxed and soaked up the atmosphere; she knew that soon Nick would be making his presence known and it would be time for her to even the score. <br />
<br />
They had all just gathered to talk about how they would be returning the Paragon City when gunfire opened up from the distance and chatter sparked up on the security channel.  Cathy was waiting for this moment.  She turned to Charles. &quot;It's Nick.  Tell everyone to fall back, he just wants me.  I've been thinking of a plan, but I'll need your help, as well as Gerald's and Madison's.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick walked past the defense perimeter, the security force's bullets ricocheting harmlessly off his combat suit.  The suit that was supposed to become the image for him as a hero in Paragon City. The suit that was supposed to vault him to celebrity status.  But Cathy had ruined it all.  With the fallout of the multi-billion dollar deal resting squarely on his shoulders, his future in Crey Industries had been given a huge black mark.  He was too young to have his future ruined so badly and so thoroughly by one little mistake.  It was all her fault.   &quot;I'm going to kill her, and I'm going to make everyone watch&quot; he muttered to himself, his anger a red mist clouding his mind. <i>'She's going to scream in pain and I'm going to love it.'</i>  He plodded on, ignoring the gunfire from the security guards <i>'They can't hurt me.  They're unimportant.  I want Nightprowl, and this time I'm going to snap her little neck.'</i><br />
<br />
Cathy slipped off her sandals and waited for Nick to arrive.  &quot;Zeus, Magick&quot; she said, looking at the two big cats.  &quot;Stay by Madison, and don't worry about me.&quot;  She looked at Charles, Gerald, and Madison.  &quot;Remember the plan.  Just let me do my thing, and don't worry - I'll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked over at Jack.  He was leaning back in his chair with a foot propped up on the table and an open bottle of Corona in his hand. Before she could say anything he answered her thoughts. &quot;I wouldn't dream of butting in on your action, kitten.  Besides, I'm on vacation.&quot;  Cathy grinned and shook her head.  &quot;Thanks Jack.  And don't call me kitten.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NIGHTPROWL!  I'M CALLING YOU OUT!  PREPARE TO DIE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy turned around and caught her first glimpse of the battle suit.  It was dull grey, and its hands and feet were oversized for its body.  a full helmet covered Nick's face, and that would be where Cathy would concentrate her attack.  &quot;Nightprowl's not here, Nick&quot; she replied lightly.  &quot;But if you want to fight Cathy Watts, I'd be happy to oblidge.&quot;  She remembered Nick squeezing the life from her and anger washed through her mind. She gritted her teeth, her nostrils flared, and an intensity crept into her voice.  &quot;In fact, I'd be downright ecstatic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick plodded towards Cathy; the night's wait had only caused his hatred for her to come to a boil, a red mist of anger for the person who had ruined his best chance at fame, recognition, and a skyrocketting promotion up the Crey Corporate ladder.  &quot;I'm going to cut you in half&quot; he announced, revealing his main weapons.  Hardened titanium blades sprung from the suit's gauntlets and locked into place with a heavy thump.<br />
<br />
Cathy grinned, raised up her hand, and inspected her fingers front and back.  &quot;I guess these'll have to do&quot;.  Without warning she sprung, closing the distance in an instant and firing her palm into the suit's chest piece.  She sprung back to her starting point and re-inspected her hand.  &quot;I really need a manicure&quot; she quipped.  Nick clutched at his chest and gasped at the shockwave Cathy had sent through the suit.  He had been hurt and concussed by her openning attack.<br />
<br />
Jack rose from his chair and announced his intentions to the group watching the fight. &quot;Well, I'm off to check out the boat again.  See ya all later, and thanks Charlie.&quot;  Gerald was shocked that Jack wasn't going to watch the fight to make sure Cathy didn't get hurt. &quot;What if Cathy needs your help?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jack laughed openly, as if Gerald had just told him a funny joke.  &quot;Heh, Cathy needing help with this chump?  Yeah, that'll happen... at the same time I fall overboard in 6 inch swells.  This guy lost the moment he put himself in her crosshairs - she's just taking her time, toying with him.  He must've really ticked her off.&quot; Jack picked up another beer from the table and began to walk down to the dock, more interested in Charles' boats than in how Cathy was going to dismantle her opponent.<br />
<br />
Cathy waited for Nick to regain his faculties.  &quot;Lucky shot!&quot; he said.  &quot;I wasn't ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy rolled her eyes.  &quot;So, what was your 'hero name' going to be anyway?  I'm thinking maybe 'Ginsu Boy', or 'Kid Cuisinart'.  With blades like those, you can slice and dice and julienne fries!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to slice and dice YOU, you whore!&quot;<br />
<br />
In a fit of anger Cathy pounced at him, evaded his first swipe, then fired a hard kick to the side of his head before slipping in behind. &quot;You watch your mouth in front of Madison, little boy&quot; she hissed, delivering another kick to his head and popping the latch on his helmet.  She jumped up in a high arc, retreating back to where she began.<br />
<br />
An unbearable ringing filled Nick's ears.  He felt like he was wearing a church bell on his head, and with every one of Cathy's strikes it was sounding a tone.  He grappled with the helmet and it came free, loosened by Cathy only seconds before.  &quot;Argh!&quot; he yelled, removing it and throwing it at her.  It sailed past her head but she didn't move an inch.  His rage was still boiling, blocking him from seeing that he was in way over his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're done, Nick.  This is your last chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring it on, freak!  I'm gonna slice you in half!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't get it, Nick. I've been playing with you, like... well, like a cat plays with a ball of string.  You're not worth being able to say 'I was caught, but it took 'The Daring Nightprowl' to do it.'  I've got something else in mind, but I had to get your helmet off first.&quot;  She raised her hand and called out. &quot;Charles - throw it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles threw the open collar like a boomerang, and as it toppled end over end, its jewels shone in the sunlight.  Gerald guided it in mid-flight, creating the illusion that Charles had pinpoint accuracy for the collar found Cathy's outstretched hand perfectly.  She crouched, deked, and sprung at Nick, pushing it high up around his neck, just under the jawline.  Being designed for Cathy's neck it was a tight fit, but the collar closed and the clasp locked, and Cathy lept free as her job was done.<br />
<br />
<br />
***8***<br />
<br />
<br />
Nick pulled at the collar around his neck, fiercely trying to get it off.  Cathy casually walked up beside him, amused at his effort.  Nick turned his attention towards her, but she skillfully dodged and his swipes found only air.  &quot;I said I had something else in mind, Nick.  What would be more humiliating that being defeated by a five year old girl?&quot;  With that Cathy called to Madison. &quot;Sweetie, you can press the button now.&quot;  Madison gave a look to Charles who smiled and nodded, and with a grin on her face she press the button on the remote control.  Nick crumpled to the ground, paralyzed.  His red mist of rage disappeared, replaced by the terrifying feeling of total helplessness.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wearing a very expensive piece of Crey Industries technology around your neck&quot; Cathy noted, mocking his words of the day before. &quot;You're also wearing a very expensive combat suit which belongs to Charles, and I promised him I'd do as little damage to it as possible in getting it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy then saw the terror in his eyes, the same fear Simon must have seen in her that first day when she was rendered helpless by the collar.  Anger and pity mixed together in her mind and a snide comment went unsaid, pushed away as being inappropriate. She knelt down beside him and wiped his matted hair away from his eyes.  She saw a scared little boy lying in front of her.  &quot;You screwed up&quot; She quietly said.  &quot;You chose the wrong side.  You chose the side of evil over good.  But you do have the opportunity to redeem yourself.  An opportunity to do the right thing.  Tell me what I want to know. Who changed the DNA test so it would look like I was Cynthia? Who gave you the drugs you used on me?  Where is Trish being held?  I promise I'll make sure the courts are lenient in your sentencing if you answer truthfully.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nick laughed nervously and hacked out a cough before struggling to compose himself.  &quot;The DNA test... it wasn't altered.  The doc said it didn't have to be.  You're genetically the same as Cynthia Monroe.  My boss actually planned for you sneaking around to get a second test done in hopes that it would convince you that you were her, but you went and pulled the thing with the TV broadcast.  We didn't see that one coming, and I guess I panicked a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand. I'm not her.  Are you saying she was a clone of me or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. I don't know, I'm just telling you what he told me.  I went to one of his labs to pick up the drugs, and the tranq gun used in your kidnapping.  He mentioned not to worry about your DNA because it'd match.  He also said you're like a daughter to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was puzzled by that statement &quot;What do you mean 'like a daughter'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like I said.  he knew that things might not work out and I had orders to kill you if the drugs didn't work.  He gave me the drugs and said 'I hope these work, because she's like a daughter to me'.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of finding answers, all Cathy was getting was more questions.  She continued with her interrogation.  &quot;Did you see my friend Trish?  The one from the video.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but doc sent the video to Charles, so he probably knows where she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was fast learning that this mysterious doctor appeared to be the linchpin to finding Trish, and to answering these new questions. &quot;Where is he.  I need a location.  Was it in Eden?  It was in Eden, right?&quot;  A hint of desperation crept into Cathy's voice, and Nick heard it.  He knew he had information she needed, and he wasn't about to give it away for free. &quot;I'm not saying anything more without a deal.  You get the doctor's name and the locations of all the Crey Research Facilities I know of, but I want immunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'Immunity'</i> Cathy thought.  <i>'He tried to kill us and he wants immunity?  I don't think so.'</i>  She thought maybe someone rougher around the edges might be able to pry the information from him.  &quot;Jack, why don't you have a talk with Nick here?&quot;  She looked up and Jack was nowhere to be found.  &quot;Where's Jack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I suppose he's getting ready to set sail&quot; Charles replied.  &quot;He said he wanted to do some exploring for a while, and since he's a friend of yours and I never use it, I lent him my sailboat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald spoke up.  &quot;I'll talk to the little punk here.  You go down to the dock and see what's going on with Jack.  He didn't tell me he was leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy walked down to the dock; Jack was on the deck of the sailboat, adjusting the riggings and checking its condition.  He appeared to be readying the sailboat to set sail.  &quot;So, you're heading off then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack looked up from his preparations.  &quot;Yup.  I figure I need some time with the sea - it's been too long.  I'm afraid I might be turning into a bit of a landlubber.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These waters were your old stomping grounds, weren't they Jack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've sailed to many places kitten, but yes, I do know my way around this part of the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked out to the sea, and then back at Jack. &quot;You know, it's been centuries... it might not be where you left it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack looked over at her and gave her a broad smile. &quot;I chose a very good hiding spot and I didn't leave a map - it'll be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy smiled, and as Jack cast off she said &quot;I don't want to hear about a new pirate in these waters Jack - you're on the side of good now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack cast off and the boat slowly slid away from the dock.  Cathy was about to repeat the statement when Jack answered back. &quot;Fair enough, but only if you tell me something. I've spent the last little while in the company of your friend, Gerald.  You know he's in love with you, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know he likes me, but love?  I'm not so sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure.  He loves ya, trust me.&quot;  Jack raised the sails and the boat began to pull away from the dock.  He looked back at Cathy standing on the dock. &quot;So, how do you feel about him.  Do you love him?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Cathy wasn't sure she wanted to be discussing this part of her life with Jack, but he had helped Gerald find her so she answered him.  &quot;Yeah, I think so.&quot; she replied<br />
<br />
Jack called out from the deck of the boat. &quot;What?  I couldn't hear you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy raised her voice and answered again. &quot;Yes. I love him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you know what you have to do, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She called back once more. &quot;I have to tell him.&quot;<br />
<br />
With broad smile Jack shouted back. &quot;Naw kitten, all you have to do is turn around.  He's standing right behind you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy turned around, and sure enough Gerald was standing there with a nervous look on his face.  He quickly changed the subject to avoid the awkwardness of the situation.  &quot;Um, I had a talk with Nick.  I was able to read his mind a bit to get some information, but when I started digging deeper he figured out what I was doing and began blocking me.  I think he's telling the truth though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy thought back to what Nick had said.  &quot;He said I'm the same as Cynthia Monroe, and that this 'doc' guy knew me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor Stevenson.  I was able to get that name from him.  Do you recognize it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  He said I was 'like a daughter' to him.  Could my mutation have been intentional?  Maybe he considers me like a daughter because he triggered my mutation.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Gerald knew she was only throwing out guesses.  &quot;Cathy, you're getting ahead of yourself.  We only have some of the pieces of the puzzle and you're trying to put everything together.  We need to find this doctor first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy became agitated, frustrated that just when she thought she understood the reason why she was there, why she was abducted, the tables had been turned and she found herself more confused than before.  &quot;Then tell me, Gerry... what the hell am I supposed to do in the meantime?  Who the hell am I?  I don't have any idea any more.  Do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're Cathy Watts, a successful businesswoman.  You're also Nightprowl, a hero of Paragon City.&quot; Her expression told him that it wasn't enough.  He saw that to her those were just names; labels.  Gerald looked into her eyes and spilled out his heart and soul.  &quot;You're the woman I think about when I go to bed every night and when I wake up every morning.  You're the woman I've been pining over for the last four years, trying to build up enough courage to make the next move but terrified that all I'd do was screw up the good friendship we have. You're the most important person in my life. You're the woman I love, Cathy.  That's who you are.&quot;  He looked away and went quiet, feeling that he had just said way too much.<br />
<br />
The reservoir of clever quips, retorts, and comebacks she drew upon as Nightprowl was suddenly empty, and all Cathy could muster was a quiet &quot;Oh.  Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy slid her hand into Gerald's and their fingers intertwined. She leaned her head on his shoulder and followed his gaze out to sea.  They quietly watched a flock of snowy egrets skim over the rolling waves, and a lone sailboat slip out over the horizon.<br />
<br />
