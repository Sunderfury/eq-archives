			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So my computer just turned off briefly and reset itself while I was reading something. It acted like it would if a brownout or something had occurred, yet as far as I could tell nothing of the sort had happened. Im pretty sure this happened the other morning, I woke up to find the computer had been reset and windows update hadn't done anything. And like just now, there was no evidence of the power going out or anything, both DVRs in the house still had the TV listings fully intact.<br />
<br />
So is this something that could be a potential problem assuming its not the power dipping briefly or something?</div>

<b>Thoughts</b><br />
<br />
So basically Jugular line will become a new ability we use. No one used it before as 2.5 min reuse vs 20sec or whatever it is for onslaught it's no brainer.<br />
<br />
Mark and Asp Blade are now split up so we can use both (yay).<br />
<br />
Deadly Aim disc is a bit pointless in general, so no real effect.</div>
