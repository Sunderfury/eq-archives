So anymore fellow returning or veterans still running around? :)<br />

Oh yes, I would like some help on setting macros too. What are the essentials? I remember I used to have a duck out of combat macro, an assist main tank, a start combat with BS (probly share with the BS macro, yes?), and one for practicing pickpocket.  Can anyone please help to fill in memory? Thanks!</div>
