		<title>Endurance gear</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Question: How many of you fellow rogues have invested in End regen gear? I find myself running out of endurance often and thought about having my guild crafters make me some gear. Is it worth it?

Follow up question: Is this a problem for most of you? Maybe I'm just doing something wrong but I seem to run out of endurance an awful lot during fights.

Thanks in advance!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wep DMG * skill_multiplier) + Base_Dmg + Misc_Dmg = auto attack

((Wep_Dmg * Skill_Mult) * Attack_mod) + Base_Dmg + Misc Dmg = Weapon based special

((Wep_Dmg * Skill_Mult) + Base_Dmg + Misc_Dmg) * Attack_Mod = Melee based special

Most classes only have auto attack and weapon based specials.  Some classes like Monk have all 3.  

If you are max skill in that weapon type, you can recieve as much as a 10% bonus.

As far as the critical cap (from Cylus in other forums).

If the mob is equal, higher level or not gray (below within 5) there is no critical hit % cap from items. From stats it is 17% (i.e. Dex). But, if the mob is 6 levels or lower it is 10% from items.

Above is the link to a post about possible AA's (alternative advancement if you didn't know), and, a class based teleportation system. Addtionally, there might be class specialization.

Even though it's from a class lead and not an actual dev, leads seem to be pretty well informed.

		<title>Server Merge</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[How has the server merge affected you? 

And now that they have fixed ae's/ds's breaking stealth how playable do you think our class is (on a ascale of 1-10)? I don't mean in comparison to other classes, but more about how you feel personally in relation to your own personal goals as a rogue.

========================================================

For me it has meant getting a group most of the time and meeting a ton of new folks. I think it's been positive step in the right direction. 

I think we have a unique class that is pretty good at dps and ok at a lot of utility and is plain bad at other things. Solo we suck. In a group we shine. I think that the coolest thing is that we are totally playable in a group and things are only going to get better as they fix/adjust us.]]></description>

		<title>Stealth by the numbers...</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I am trying to figure out stealth. When you first enter stealth, there is a 1 in the bottom right corner of the icon. Now, I seem to notice it doesn't go up unless I am in battle. So a couple of questions:

1) Does going to stealth 2,3,4 etc happen from the amount of time you are in stealth, or is it based on damage while in stealth?  Time in battle?
2) Does being in a higher stealth mean you are better hidden, and are less likely to be seen?
3) Do you do more damage the higher in stealth you go?

If anyone knows please let me know.
Thanks,
Ryythor]]></description>

		<title>Coming back</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Well, I've been watching the progress of this game ever since I quit back in Feb. I think I like where rogue is finally at, as the DS/AE bug is now gone which was my biggest problem playing the class, drove me nuts. I wanted to ask a few questions as my client is being updated.

I see that there's going to be a merger here in the next few days. Have they said at all how many servers there's going to be after the merger? 

The client hitching problem, is this now gone? This was a bug where if you were in a party in a dungeon the game would hitch really bad to the point of a few FPS it seemed like. 

Now that I'm coming back, where would be a good place to find out information on guilds that are recruiting people. I see that Ten Ton Hammers is dead it seems. Silky Venom doesn't have a section dedicated for this either so I'm not sure where else to look. 

Thanks in advance, hope this game is better then when I left it.]]></description>

		<title>40% Cap in PVP</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I understand that the rogue class is not in high population but did anyone ever consider the 40% damage cap on our class in pvp?  Our movement speed is 80% due to movement buffs still not working properly while in stealth.  We are a melee class that has to close the gap to be effective and our only combat stance requires us to remain in stealth.  Now when we are hit our damage drops 20%.  In addition I would like some clarification on why Quickblade is being included in the 40% cap as the discription says that it causes some attacks to strike a &quot;SECOND&quot; time.  This is not one hit.  I was under the impression that the timer on quickblade being lowered was a buff rather than the huge nerf it appears to be.  Is Quickblade suppose to strike twice as in the description or not?  When will movement buffs work in stealth?  With a minimum of 3 hits to kill our damage will decrease 20% every fight as we will be out of stealth.  Essentially as it stands now the rogue class appears to be utter garbage for pvp while healing classes have been evelvated even higher than they were previously.]]></description>

		<title>Frustrated with my Rogue</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I took a break from my Rogue once I got my Shadowhound and hit 33rd level.  Went back to my 24 Ranger and worked on the crafting grind.  I then proceeded to work the Unicorn quest with my Ranger.  Now I have my Ranger at 31st level and decided to go back to my Rogue for some fun.  My shock is in that my 31 Ranger can kill mobs much more powerful than my 33 Rogue.  An example would be the 29-31 3 dot Troglodytes in VT area.  My ranger can kill them easily and my rogue is a tombstone in a short amount of time.  I have no buffs to use and no spells to cast.  I have to pay money for the few buffs I can perform and even then they last 15m or less.  Where is the love for the Rogue class?]]></description>
