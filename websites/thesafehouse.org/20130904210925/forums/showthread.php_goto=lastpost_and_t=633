    <div align="left" id="post_message_4609">Minz glanced around. The soft chatter of forest life was just beginning to rise. The sun's rays were peering over the hills to the west. Clearing the mist that hung throughout the woods.<br />
<br />
Minz hadn't wasted any time putting distance between he and Paineel. Setting out at as brisk a pace as he could manage. The Dragons were to make camp near the river, east of Paineel. &quot;Please let this be east,&quot; he muttered. Soon the smell of bacon, cheese, onions and eggs wafted through the air. Quezex's famous &quot;Omelet of Doom&quot; no doubt. The rogue sighed with relief as he heard the sounds of a festive camp. Palsel's off key caterwauling resounded loudly. Windam's giggle could be heard too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vomitous lightdwellers,&quot; he snarled. Tier Dal hatred washing over him. Minz shook his head violently. &quot;These are my friends,&quot; he thought to himself. 'And they will die!' came the haunting reply, echoing in his head. &quot;No,&quot; he said a bit too loudly. Glancing around again. Mentally latching onto the feelings of friendship and camaraderie that he felt for the Dragons. A warm smile crept over his face. 'Ohhhh its good to hear them,' he thought. 'Home. Family. They were th . . . the spider!'<br />
<br />
Minz froze in his tracks and glanced about nervously.<br />
<br />
A watch would be posted.<br />
<br />
Had he been seen already?<br />
<br />
He thrust himself to a tree. Holding his breath as he listened for any sign of discovery. The moments crept by. A chirp here. The croak of a frog there. A cobalt howled mournfully. Its dog-like voice singing of despair. The sounds of camp continued uninterrupted.<br />
<br />
Minz closed his eyes a moment. Trying to figure out what he should do. 'Do I go into camp like this?' he pondered. 'Explain what happened? Or should I go as myself? Or even as a drow, a wandering traveler. Gods! As myself. It must be. They must not know.' Minz sighed heavily. Hanging his head in shame for the deception he would weave.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Minz raised his hand up to his chest. Fingers resting on the alien creature embedded in his flesh. It was warm to his touch, wriggling under his fingers. Minz dug his fingers under it, prying the thing away from his skin. The Spider resisted his efforts, struggling to dig deeper into his flesh with its eight long needle-like legs.<br />
<br />
The pain bore into him. It was as if his flesh were being torn away from his chest. His skin stretching vulgarly as he struggled to dislodge the vile thing. He heard his flesh tear, as each leg ripped free. Blood trickling down his chest and seeping into his clothes. The amulet piercing ever deeper in a vain attempt to hang on, slick with gore and bits of his skin hanging off. Squirming and reaching to merge once again with his flesh. He cried out. Anger and pain flooding his throat as he wrenched the thing free. It froze in his hand. Once again becoming the silver amulet.<br />
<br />
Everything went black.<br />
<br />
His body shuddered. Bones cracking and crying out as they melded into a new shape. Sickened with nausea as organs shifted and changed in his belly. His skin tingled and stretched painfully over his whole body. He fell to the earth. The spider amulet was motionless in his hand. Cold to the touch. The echoes of his yell faded into the distance.<br />
<br />
Footsteps could be heard. Running in his direction. He struggled to gain his feet. But his legs would not respond. He was helpless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Minz!&quot; Ascrida's voice was unmistakable. High pitched, yet not light in the ear. &quot;Help him up. Now!&quot; Strong arms lifted him to his feet. Supporting him as he struggled to walk on his own. He was placed on a woolen blanket. Heat swept toward him. The fire was near.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine!&quot; he said grouchily. He struggled to sit up. The haze that hung on him faded. Strength returned to his limbs. The wound in his chest burned. Minz slipped the amulet into his pocket. 'Are my eyes open or closed?' The thought sliced though his mind like a razor, and he squeezed his eyelids shut.<br />
<br />
A hand pushed him back down. &quot;You'll be fine when I say your fine,&quot; Ascrida snapped. Her voice came from his left, and he turned his head, as if looking at her. A hand lifted his chin and small fingers examined his wound. &quot;Well Wind? What happened to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I didn't know better,&quot; Wind intoned questioningly. &quot;I would swear something had grabbed hold of him and he pulled himself free. . . some how. See how the skin is torn here, and here. Poisoned too it looks like. What happened Minz?&quot;<br />
<br />
He struggled inwardly to come up with something plausible. Something believable. 'Why lie,' he thought. &quot;You wouldn't believe me if I told you,&quot; He muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try me,&quot; Ascrida replied. Her high elven stoicism evident in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just fix it and leave me be,&quot; he snapped. He heard Windam stand. The healing magics rushed through his body in soothing waves. The energies of nature coaxing his skin to mend. Showing his body how it ought to be. A far cry from the malignant healing of necromancy. He shuddered at the memory. The healing ended. He sighed with relief. Bit by bit feeling the tension ebb away.<br />
<br />
Wind gasped in horror.<br />
<br />
The sound shot a shock through his nerves. He sat up abruptly. Pressing his hands to the ground and pulling his legs up and under him. Crouching in a low balanced stance. The instant reaction of one whom knew violence. His hand instinctively snatching the triangular bladed dirk hidden at his wrist. The smell of poison filled his nostrils. It was small by most standards. A blade merely 5 inches long. And it had no cross guard. Just blade and grip. But it served its purpose well. Staying hidden, but always at the ready. Its length was coated with a deadly poison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Minz. . . your . . .&quot; Wind's voice quavered with shock. &quot;your eyes. What happened to them?&quot; The din in the camp had become silence. He could feel eyes resting on him.<br />
<br />
Cocking his head, he listened to their breathing. Trying to count their number. 'Five. . . six . . . seven. Maybe more.' He thought. Minz spun the dagger in his fingers. Bringing the business end of the blade over his palm. The blade now down, its hilt facing outward its point toward himself. He slid the dagger easily into the sheath tied to the underside of his opposite wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;. . . he's blind.&quot; He heard whispered. It was Vallden. Syl must have sent word some how. &quot;Noo!&quot; was the others hushed reply. &quot;Yes,&quot; Minz said loudly. &quot;Yes, I'm blind as a bat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Palsel broke the silence. &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the desert of Ro. I was lost for days. Sylavn, Vall's good cousin, found me.&quot; Minz said, nodding in the direction Vall's voice had come from. &quot;When I awoke, I could not see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that does not explain your eyes Minz.&quot; Legadas intoned suspiciously. &quot;You're eyes are brown. Were brown. And now we see you with green eyes? How can this be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I know!&quot; Minz snapped. &quot;What the hell do you think I've been wondering?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you know they're green?&quot; Legadas asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Minz all but shouted in exasperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're blind? How could you know?&quot; Legadas questioned. Minz heard the elf step closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I . . . .some one told me! I don't know!&quot; Minz was caught. &quot;What the hell is this anyway? I'm blinded and now held in suspicion for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one suspects you of anything,&quot; Ascrida said calmly. &quot;Its just that much has happened. And you have been away for some time. Come. Let's get breakfast. We can talk afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quezex's Omelet of doom was outstanding as always. He and Ascrida sat together. She filled him in on the recent happenings. &quot;Xareth has continued to taunt the Dragons,&quot; She said quietly. &quot;The drow rants about how our very actions are dooming Silverstarr. And of the &quot;keys&quot; to curing his and Silverstarr's malady being in our very hands. Our efforts to negotiate a deal with him, whereby our order and his would work together toward a solution were consistently rebuffed. His actions are becoming more rash and desperate with each sortie.&quot; She sighed heavily. &quot;One thinks his time grows near Minz,&quot; Ascrida said quietly. The worry in her voice was clear. &quot;If he dies, will Silverstarr die too? It is what he has claimed all along. And why he has been spared. But . . .&quot; Her words trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, what if it's nothing more than a ploy. He would kill her himself, even if there is no malady in Sil. This curse he talks of. He and Silver are created from the same soul? I don't buy it. True or not though, I think you are right. Xareth's death grows near. And one way or another, he will end Silverstarr's life with his.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is nearby,&quot; Ascrida said calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here?!&quot; Minz asked, astonished by Xareth's boldness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, he said he has something for us.&quot; She replied ruefully. &quot;One wonders.&quot; Minz uttered a hoarse thanks, and asked to be alone for a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Minz?&quot; Hearing his name yanked him out of his musings. &quot;Minz, would ya like some more coffee bud?&quot; Even when he spoke, Palsel had a musical quality to his voice. Minz patted the ground next to him, looking for his mug, cocking an ear, and listening hard. The camp was just about silent. His fingers brushed against the clay cup, and he held it out to the bard. &quot;They've all gone off to the caves.&quot; Palsel said. &quot;You have quite an ear ya know. I've watched you, and seen how you listen.&quot; Palsel pressed the warm cup into Minz's hands. &quot;You'd have made a fine bard, I think. Listening is critical to playing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't you go with them Palsel?&quot; Minz asked, brushing the bard's banter aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh, I need to replace a string on my lute,&quot; Palsel replied, turning what ought to be a three word answer into a dissertation. Some things never changed. &quot;. . .and it was my turn to wash the damned dishes. Boy this troop makes a lot of dirty dishes; and . . . and well, have you ever smelled that place? It brings new meaning to the term shithole. I mean, I know they're like dogs and all, but . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ascrida told you to stay didn't she?&quot; Minz interjected.<br />
<br />
The bard chuckled. &quot;Yea, she did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did she tell you to do? Baby-sit me?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Errrr, well. . . not exactly.&quot; Palsel said haltingly. &quot;I am to wait for the cleric she sent for and go get her when she arrives&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cleric! What the hell.&quot; Minz all but shouted. Spilling his coffee on his leg. &quot;Ouch! Doncha think I might have had something to say about it? That I might not want a cleric or anyone else to look at me? Gimme a rag dammit!&quot; Minz held at a hand, and cloth was thrust into it. He blotted at his leg, muttering curses under his breath. Minz shot his head up, cocking an ear. Footsteps could be heard. A pair of travelers. Light on the earth. Elven of some sort. &quot;Who's that Palsel. To your left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be your cleric I think.&quot; Palsel said, standing to address the cleric. &quot;Milady Calaquendi?&quot;<br />
<br />
Minz raised an eyebrow. 'Rhuobe Calaquendi's sister?' he thought. Remembering back to the day Rhuobe left the Order of Elder Dragons. Lythe had been with him when he left. But he was near. A member of the noble order Evoluxa. Allies to the Dragons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye. Is the Lady De Fewithe about,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I shall fetch her my dear.&quot; Minz could almost hear the cleric begin to simmer at Palsel's eternal flirtation. &quot;In the mean time, here is your patient.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its been a while Minz,&quot; Rhuobe said pleasantly. Tryllium knelt down next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rhuobe! Aye, it has been too long! What are you doing in this neck of the woods?&quot; Minz replied, smiling broadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard that a rogue of the Elder Dragons was in need. Who else but Minz could it be?&quot; he said, his voice laden with humor. &quot;So, we journeyed her to pull your ass out of the fire one more time. Just like old times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. . . &quot; Tryllium said expectantly. &quot;Are you gonna tell me what's the matter? Or do I have to guess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its his eyes,&quot; Palsel announced. &quot;He's blind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you have some where to go!?&quot; Minz said sourly. He heard the bard turn and walk off head toward the caverns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blind? How did this happen?&quot; Rhuobe asked. Minz heard Tryllium opening her bag, and rolling out a tool pouch of some kind. Her hands moved before his face, and he could feel her lean toward him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got lost in the desert. Ended up on my back, staring at the sun for a few days,&quot; he replied flatly. He felt her fingers press and pull lightly at the skin around his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, that wasn't too bright was it? Uhmm hmmm. Well, there's nothing I can see that's wrong.&quot; She said. &quot;The pupils respond to light. The problem is not your eyes. Your eyes see fine. The problem is that some how these eyes of yours aren't sending the images to your mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minz cringed inwardly. 'You're closer to the truth than you know.' He thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;What news have you Lady Calaquendi?&quot; Ascrida asked. Startling Minz.<br />
<br />
Tryllium stood and addressed Ascrida. &quot;I can find no injury or malady in his eyes themselves. They are working fine. The injury lies deeper within him. Perhaps the extreme exposure to the sun burnt the nerves that link his eyes to his brain. He has some odd scaring around his eyes, but I doubt they're related.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that changed their color too?&quot; Ascrida asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change the color? Eyes don't change color. Under any circumstances.&quot; Tryllium knelt back down. Minz turned his head, shunning her touch. Her finger gently brushed against his face. Tracing the scar left by the surgery. Her hand gripped his chin, turning his face to the other side. Her touch following the scars there. She whispered, &quot;Is there something you want to tell me Minz?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; was his flat reply.<br />
<br />
Tryllium sighed, and stood up. She spoke in a direct, matter of fact tone. &quot;Some sort of surgery has been performed on him. If I had to guess, I would say that his eyes were surgically removed and the ones you see now were grafted to him. It is likely that this was an unsuccessful attempt to restore his sight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my business!&quot; Minz snapped, rising to his feet. &quot;No one else's!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is Minz,&quot; Ascrida said warily. &quot;But why would you hide it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ascrida's question caught him off guard. Piercing to the heart of his deception. He didn't tell them because of who did it. Because where it was done. And because of where the eyes came from. He could all but hear them waiting.<br />
<br />
'Stay as close to the truth as possible.' This is the rule for deception. For lying. The farther one strayed, the easier it is to discover the lie. But the closer one stayed to the truth, the greater the likelihood that the truth will be seen. &quot;The operation was dangerous.&quot; He said. &quot;Not only was the risk of failure great, but death as well. It was a decision I had to make on my own.&quot; He heard the soft rustle of fabric to his right. A nod or some small motion. 'Tryllium confirming the statement. Good'<br />
<br />
&quot;But, whose eyes are those?&quot; Palsel asked. Speaking up for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don't know. I didn't ask.&quot; Minz replied. In reality, this was true. Silence hung in the air. No one wanted to hear any more. Especially Minz. Thankfully, the rest of the Dragons could be heard approaching the camp. Their raucous bellowing disrupting the quiet of the forest.<br />
<br />
The evening went well. Wine and stories circled the campfire in equal measure. Tryllium and Rhuobe decided to stay the evening. Rhuobe shared tales of the old days. Of the time he spent as a member of the Order of Elder Dragons. Telling stories about the great battles the Dragons fought. Bringing roars of laughter with embarrassing tales of Minz's youth. Of Denadra and Branline. Of Jao and Lythe. Of Marina and Cerawyn. Minz smiled softly, remembering the number of times each had saved him from certain and unpleasant death.<br />
<br />
The fire burnt down. Tall hot flames ebbing to warm embers. Minz assigned watches, and the camp settled for the night. The wood of Odus had an odd smell about it. Spicy, like most things here. Not at all unpleasant either. Some one sat down next to him. &quot;I've been talking with Tryll,&quot; Rhuobe said quietly. &quot;She tells me that there are few places that this surgery could be done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Minz muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or more to the point, few who would actually do it. It's a black black thing Minz.&quot; Minz raised an eyebrow, empty eyes staring strait ahead. &quot;The eyes had to be taken while the person was still alive Minz.&quot; He hissed. &quot;He was alive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there ain't a damn thing I can do about it now is there,&quot; Minz spat in disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, there isn't,&quot; Rhuobe answered as he stood to leave. &quot;But you could have. Couldn't you?&quot; With that, he walked away. Unwilling to hear the answer that Minz would not give. Rhuobe and Tryllium said their good byes and disappeared into the forest.<br />
<br />
Soon enough the camp was silent. The low fire hissed as the last of its heat bled into the night air. The watchers' footsteps told of their silent vigil. The regular breathing of sleep could be heard all about him. Palsel snored. Loudly.<br />
<br />
Dawn came and Minz made ready to leave. A cold sweat had developed on his brow, and he felt a nervous tremor in his hands for some reason. &quot;Where are we off to?&quot; Legadas asked pleasantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Business.&quot; Minz replied curtly. &quot;You really don't want to know.&quot; Bending over to pick up his pack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Business?&quot; he asked, barely hiding his disdain now. &quot;What kind of business can a blind thief do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, you don't want to know,&quot; Minz replied. Glaring at the wood elf as he slipped an arm through the shoulder strap of his pack. His chest tingled uncomfortably, as he grabbed his harpoon from its spot against a tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you try me Minz!&quot; He yelled, shoving the rogue. Sending Minz stumbling back. He lost his grip in the harpoon, and it fell ground. &quot;You disappear for weeks, doing @#%$ knows what.&quot; Minz caught his balance, and righted himself. Legadas was literally on top of him. The wood elf's chest butting up against his own. &quot;You show up, out of the blue, with a lame excuse as to where you've been. You're blind, and underwent some sort of wicked surgery, that took the eyes if not the life of another and now you're just prancing off on your merry way, saying its 'business'?! And this is OK? This is alright? Well it ain't alright with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Legadas shoved him again. But Minz had had enough. He tossed aside his pack and hurled himself forward, grabbing onto Legadas' tunic with his left hand, and landing two quick rights to the wood elf's face.<br />
<br />
Shouting erupted all around.<br />
<br />
Minz's third punch was blocked.<br />
<br />
A heavy impact to his gut sent the wind out of him.<br />
<br />
Minz steadied himself by hanging onto Legadas. Sending another fist to his chin.<br />
<br />
A leg snaked around his, and they hit the ground hard. Legadas raining blows down on him. Throwing Minz's face from right to left and back again.<br />
<br />
Minz brought his knee up hard. Ramming it into Legadas' crotch, throwing his assailant off as the wood elf froze in the rictus of pain.<br />
<br />
The camp around him was silent. Stung by the shock of two Dragons coming to blows. Tension hung in the air. The two lay on the ground. Minz could hear Legadas next to him, breathing hard. Minz sat up with a groan. &quot;Enough,&quot; he said through heavy breaths of his own. &quot;My business is mine alone. If you have a problem with that then deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Legadas sat up next to him. &quot;Its not 'your business' what ever that might be, that I have a problem with,&quot; he spat. &quot;Its you. You are the Pendragon! Start acting like it!&quot; Legadas stood, and stomped off. Into the surrounding woods by the sound of it.<br />
<br />
Minz took a heavy breath, standing to address the rest of the guild. Doing his best to temper his frustration. &quot;Is this how you all feel?&quot; he shouted. Spreading his arms wide. Hands trembling slightly. Voice tinged with anger. He paused. A pregnant silence abounded. No one was willing to speak out &quot;That I am not good enough?&quot; His voice rose even higher. &quot;That I am not pure enough?&quot; His temper flared. &quot;If so, you need only tell me, and I will leave! Come on! No one else thinks this? No one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not that?&quot; Palsel began, but Minz cut his word short.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not what Palsel?&quot; Minz snapped, spinning to face the bard with unseeing eyes.<br />
<br />
Palsel hesitated. &quot;Its not that we think you're unfit. But you have been gone for quite some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minz grit his teeth. Pushing back a tremor. &quot;And I am so essential? That the Order cannot function without me?&quot; He ranted. &quot;Who would take my place? Who will bear this emblem?&quot; He reached into his shirt, pulling the crest of the Elder Dragon from the pocket next to his heart and held it aloft so all could see. &quot;Who will bear this burden?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Minz no . . .&quot; Ascrida intoned calmly. But Minz interrupted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You Ascrida? You would take my place?&quot; he yelled. Teetering on the edge of hysteria.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Minz. I would not.&quot; She stated in calm measured tones. &quot;No one doubts you, nor does anyone desire your resignation. Only that you not sink so far from view. We depend on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minz took a heavy breath. Rivulets of sweat ran down his back. He clenched his fist to hide the tremor that he feared was becoming all too obvious. His chest itched and twinged. The scar where the spider rested he realized. He took another deep breath, doing his best to vanquish the anger that simmered just below the surface. &quot;I do not contact you all for the simple reason that doing so might highlight my presence. Making known my location in places I would rather remain anonymous. But I shall try.&quot; The tension seemed to lessen. The charge in the air diminished. &quot;Please forgive my outburst. Now, with your leave, I must away. I shall contact you soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
A hand was placed on his shoulder, and Vallden's voice sounded in his ear. The whispered language of one rogue to another. &quot;Luck in the shadows Minz. Send word to me, and I shall pass it on.&quot; Minz nodded. Vall helped place his pack onto his onto his shoulder and handed him his harpoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be safe Minz,&quot; Ascrida said. He smiled in her direction. Smiled as best he could at least, and headed off in silence. Thumping his harpoon on the soft earth every other step. Listening for the telltale echoes that he had learned to navigate by. None offered to accompany him. He would have accepted no company and they all knew it.<br />
<br />
The spires weren't too far. A league or two, no more. After 20 or 30 minutes, he reached the spires. The hard echoes that came back to him made their presence unmistakable. 'Incredible,' he thought. Dragging the butt of his harpoon on the rough stone as he followed the edge of it. 'How long had these stood?' but his pondering were interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon my, your opulence,&quot; the voice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Minz cocked and, listening hard. Wondering if it was he that was being called &quot;opulence.&quot; The voice was that of an elf, Tier 'Dal by the sound of it. He had the odd crisp accents of the drow. Emphasizing syllables that were generally passed over by the common tongue. And he seemed to be behind something. A tree most likely. He was suspicious, immediately. 'What the hell would a Tier 'Dal be doing here, he thought. Clearly the folks in Erudine wouldn't welcome them. Paineel, maybe. But we're aweful close to Erudine. And why would he be hiding?'<br />
<br />
&quot;Would ye be Minz Elandril, of the respected Order of Elder Dragons,&quot; he said nervously.<br />
<br />
Minz raised an eyebrow at the drow. &quot;Aye, I am Minz.&quot; He said, thumping his harpoon on the ground, gauging the distance and position of the drow.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you have the time, I would speak with you about your order, your grace.&quot; He said. His voice trailed off. The sound changed to his ear as though the drow withdrew behind the tree.<br />
<br />
'Well,' he thought. 'Not the first time some one had sought me out in such a fashion.' Many had approached him in order to petition to join the Order, and though it galled him that he might be so commonly known, to answer such inquiries was part of his duties as Pendragon. Minz wandered behind the tree. The faint clank of plate mail sounded in his ear. A warrior of some kind he thought. &quot;How may I be of service to you?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Minz heard the long hiss of a two handed sword drawn from a scabbard. &quot;You gave me a start your majesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minz tensed, wary of the drow's blade. &quot;Its Minz, please. Just Minz.&quot; He intoned.<br />
<br />
The ring of the mail sounded again. The drow seemed to be glancing about nervously. &quot;You aren't some sort of spell caster are you?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
Minz chuckled, &quot;Naahh. I wouldn't know what to do with a spell. What troubles you fri. . .&quot; Minz cut his words short mid sentence. The hiss of a sword slicing through the air sounded in his ears. A dirk leapt to his hand. Minz spun toward the drow and to his left, hoping he faced a right handed opponent. Pushing too close to his opponent for the great sword to be of any use. He threw his right shoulder into the inkie, tossing him off balance. The drow stumbled forward and Minz lashed out with his left hand, reaching across his body to sink the slender blade deep into the drow's back.<br />
<br />
He kicked the feet out from under his opponent. Snatching the drow's arm as he fell. Desperately trying to remain in contact with his opponent. His worst fear was that if he lost his grip, he wouldn't know where the next attack might come from. Falling on top of him as the drow hit the earth. Yanking his dagger out and pounding it back down through he elf's back again and again.<br />
<br />
The life bled out of the drow warrior quickly. He called out through a blood clogged windpipe, &quot;Ezerla, I have failed you?&quot; and died. Minz leaned heavily on his arms. One hand still clenching a blade embedded into the drow's back. He panted hard. 'He was inexperienced,' Minz thought. Counting his blessings. He reached into his pocket, pulling out the spider amulet. Grimacing at the thought of using it, but some how needing it.<br />
<br />
He pulled his tunic open at the throat and presses the cold metal to his chest. Instantly its legs pierced his flesh, pulling itself into Minz. He cringed at the pain momentarily, then sighing with relief. A cold comfort spread from his chest outward. Starting at the amulet in his chest reaching all the way to his toes. Suddenly, the rictus of the change gripped him. Pulling and bending bones and organs. But it wasn't as painful this time. And his strength stayed with him. He felt none of the dizziness that held him before. Vision flooded his eyes. His hands were covered in blood. As was his shoulder. The warrior had hit him after all. He gave the dagger a twist, for hates sake, and sheathed it on his wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmiinnzz.&quot; The taunting voice floated out of no where.<br />
<br />
Minz hopped up and pressed his back against the tree. Searching for the source of the call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmiinnzz. Come out and plaaayyy!&quot;<br />
<br />
'A rogue?' he thought. Slipping instantly into the protective shadows that all rogues know.<br />
<br />
A twig snapped<br />
<br />
Like a snake striking its prey, Minz's hand snapped out and shot a throwing star at the sound. The rogue fell out of his shadows, grasping quickly at the small wound. Minz cast aside his shadows and lunged at the rogue. He was human, wearing a chain tunic and black scaled leggings.<br />
<br />
His blows were quick and precise. Not the amateur that his partner was. Minz was weakening. He contemplated running, but that meant turning his back. And that was a mistake he would not make. Things looked bleak. He was bleeding heavily. Lights flickered about him. His wounds closed. Stemming the loss of blood. This was a touch he knew. The healing magic's of a ranger.<br />
<br />
He spied the young wood elf casting. For a moment he froze. The wood elf looked so much like Orrianna. 'But why would she be here,' he thought. 'And why would she help him.'<br />
<br />
His opponent's blade brought his attention back to the fight. Slicing his arm open. But Minz had the upper hand now. He was invigorated by the magics of the ranger. Driving his opponent back farther and farther. Until the human rogue finally turned and run. Yelling, &quot;This is not the last time we shall meet Dragon. Iniquitas' day will come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minz gave chase, but only fleetingly. Wanting to rush back to see if it was Orri who had saved him. But the ranger was gone. Disappearing into the forest.<br />
<br />
Minz dragged the drow warrior's body out of the way. Hiding it in the hollow of a tree. He returned to the spires and leaned against the gray stone. Breathing hard. Pondering what had just happened. And why. 'Inequitas? What or who the hell is that?' After about 20 minutes and an Erudite wizard appeared. More than willing to take him where ever he desired . . . for a fee.<br />
<br />
The Wizard obligingly dropped him in the midst of the Butcher Block Mountains; collected his fee and left. Minz removed his amulet. To say dark elves were not looked upon kindly in this area was to make a grand understatement. From butcher Block it was just a short boat ride to Firona Vie. And to the components to make the poison he would need for his assassination.<br />
<br />
Firona Vie was just as he remembered it. The people were snooty as ever. Their damned noise made traveling hard. People chattering and shouting everywhere. It took him quite some time and quite a few stumbles, but he made it out of the city.<br />
<br />
Once a safe distances away, he replaced his amulet on his chest. The pain had almost completely subsided. It no longer overwhelmed him during the change. Each time he used it the effects seemed less than the time before. But the rush of the change invigorated him. Sending a thrill of pleasure through his body. Ahead of him, he saw what he came for. Dracnids.<br />
<br />
The half spider half-drow creatures were venomous in the extreme. Taking down whole parties as they travel between Firona Vie and the Lake of Ill Omen. To kill one himself was out of the question. No, he would just wait until some one else killed a dracnid and then he would get what he came for. The dracnid venom sac. The poison it contained was deadly to anyone. But especially potent to Tier 'Dals.<br />
<br />
Minz stalked about. Making sure to keep to the shadows. A number of dracnid corpses lay about, but most were hacked to pieces. And the chances of the venom sac being intact were slim to none.<br />
<br />
Finally a good prospect. A mighty barbarian fought with a dracnid. She used an impressive hammer to bashing the life out of it. Minz felt oddly angered by the killing. As though he and the dracnid were some how kin. But he was here for a purpose. Once the barbarian was on her way, he crept up to the dracnid's corpse. It was bruised and broken, but largely intact. This boded well for him. Had the Barbarian used a sword or an axe, the venom sac might have been sliced open, rendering it useless.<br />
<br />
Minz rolled the dracnid onto its back. They were surprisingly light, despite their size. He pulled out a small blade, a length of cord and a heavy oilcloth from his backpack. With the knife he sliced open the dracnid's belly. Its innards splurted out in a rush. Spattering his face and chest with blood and gore. The sac was next the dracnid's heart. But one couldn't go through the chest, for fear of rupturing the sac with a broken rib bone. To get at the venom sac, one had to reach up through the monster's belly and delicately cut it free.<br />
<br />
Minz sliced through the fibrous diaphragm and into the upper chamber of the dracnid's chest. Setting the knife aside, he pulled his glove off and reached a hand through the slit, eyes closed, blindly feeling around for the venom sac. The blood was still warm, and oozed out of the wound as he pressed deeper into the beast. His fingers brushed across something gelatinous. That was it. The sac. Gently he felt around for the tendrils that held it in place. He removed his arm from the dracnid and picked up his knife. Placing the blade in his hand so that its single sharp edge was pressed to his finger, he snaked back up inside the dracnid. Snipping the tendrils one by one.<br />
<br />
Finally, he came to the most delicate part. The dracnid poisoned it opponents through their fangs. So, there was a slender vessel that carried the venom from the poison sac to the fangs. To remove the sac, he had to pinch the vessel that carried the venom to the dracnid fangs shut, and then cut it. He tossed off his other glove and reached inside. Both hands now buried up to his elbows inside the beast. He pinched the vessel closed with his thumb and forefinger, slicing though the thick flesh with gentle strokes of the blade. Finally, It came free. Minz pulled his right hand out, placing the small knife on the ground, still holding the vessel to the sac closed with his left hand. And the reached back in to gently withdraw the sac. Cradling it in his palm.<br />
<br />
Once out of the dracnid's belly, Minz tied the sac closed with the cord and placed it in the oilcloth. He wiped his arms on the grass, getting as much of the gore off him as he could, and headed back. Strolling towards the ocean, to clean him.<br />
<br />
As he approached the beach, and the city of Firona Vie, he removed the amulet from his chest. Leaning against one of the trees as the change was rippled through his body. Once he reverted to a half-elf, he proceeded to the beach. Stumbling a few times as he walked down the steep hill to the ocean.<br />
<br />
The sound of the waves lapping the sand was calming. For a moment or two, he just stood and listened. The ebb and flow of the tide soothed his frayed nerves. 'Things have been moving so fast,' he thought. 'Seems like I'm being pushed . . . driven. Like the waves hurtling me faster and faster toward a rocky shore'<br />
<br />
The sound of sobbing blended itself seamlessly with the ocean. It took a minute to untangle what he heard. But when he did, he started down the beach, toward the source of the melancholy cries. It was a young lady. A wood elf if his ears weren't mistaken. &quot;Are you alright miss?&quot; He kneeled down next to the lass, resting a hand on her shoulder. She seemed to tremble and shudder at his touch. &quot;Miss?&quot; Minz felt her raise herself, looking up at him. She gasped and then slumped back down. &quot;Miss? Miss!&quot;<br />
<br />
He carefully checked her for injury. Everything seemed ok. The armor and was that of a ranger. &quot;Rangers,&quot; Minz chuckled. &quot;Always passing out at the drop of a hat.&quot; He pulled her into the shade. She had that &quot;forest smell&quot; that Orri always had. It made his nose itch. And the same build too. Perhaps a bit lighter. &quot;Ooooohh lil miss ranger . . . if you only knew the memories this brings back,&quot; he said laughing ruefully. As he went back for her gear. 'Feels familiar,' he thought. &quot;Must be a ranger thing,&quot; he muttered.<br />
<br />
He set her gear down next to her, pulled off his tunic and shirt. Tossing his boots off. Unconsciously looking back at the elf as he undid his belt and dropped his legging. Laughing at himself as he waded into the ocean. 'A blind man looking over his shoulder!' he thought. 'Bone head!' Minz waded into the ocean, diving underneath the cool waves. Bursting to the surface and shaking the water from his hair. He was momentarily disoriented. Wondering which way shore was. But a kind wave pushed past him, reminding him of the proper direction.<br />
<br />
He scrubbed his face and arms. Doing his best to rend the grime from his skin. Once clean he started back to shore. Abruptly freezing in his tracks. '@#%$!' he thought. How the hell and I going to find my clothes! And what if she's awake! Gods! I am an idiot!' he thought laughing out loud as the image if him fumbling around the beach naked burst into his mind. 'And of course about 30 or 40 people will stroll by too. What the hell am I going to do?'<br />
