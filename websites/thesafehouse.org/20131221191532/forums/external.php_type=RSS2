			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I don't know what's with me this year, I just haven't been able to get into the holiday spirit at all.  I've been singing carols in an attempt to spark the mood.<br />
 <br />
I'm actually done shopping.  Cards are late but getting addressed tonight and sent tomorrow morning.   No baking done yet, though I expect to get to that this weekend.  <br />

Maybe it's because Thanksgiving was so late this year and I'm a week behind.  Maybe it's because we haven't put up one bit of decoration except for the holiday cards we've received from friends and family.  It's pretty outside with all the snow, but there's no lights to brighten up the nights.</div>
