Cathy dropped to her knees, allowing Madison to put her feet back on the ground. They were still locked in a hug when she whispered in Madison's ear.  &quot;Madison sweetie, I need to speak with Charles alone.  We have 'big people' things to talk about.  Could you go and play with Zeus for a while?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh&quot; she innocently replied. Cathy kissed Madison on the forehead, then looked into her eyes and smiled. <i>'I feel such a connection to her'</i> she thought to herself, and for a moment she wanted Charles to be telling the truth, wanted Madison to be her daughter.  As Madison left, Cathy rose from her knees and turned to Charles.  The break from Charles' story had given her time to ground herself, to cling to the only life she knew. Her feelings for Madison were set aside, and the cool analytical mind of Nightprowl came to the forefront. &quot;You've told me an interesting tale, but you've given me no evidence to support it.  Do you expect me to take your word, after kidnapping me and holding me against my will?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have files&quot; Charles replied.  &quot;I have reports on the experiments done when you were first taken by Crey, and documents on your memory wipe.&quot;  Charles then told her what he thought would convince her.  &quot;I also have a DNA test showing that you are Madison's mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Papers?  All you have is papers?  You abducted me on the word of a two-faced corporation who probably has just as many people employed to create disinformation as they do actual research scientists.  I've dealt with Crey before - they're not who you think they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cynthia...&quot;  Charles started, but Cathy was quick to correct him.  &quot;Cathy&quot; she replied. &quot;My name is Cathy.&quot;  Charles paused for a moment to restart his explanation.  &quot;I'm sorry.  Cathy, please, at least allow me to show you the files.  I shouldn't expect you to just accept this as being the truth, it's just that for me this moment has been a long time coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was trying to remain calm, but her voice began to show tension. &quot;I can't believe anything that comes out of that company - they twist and distort the truth to suit their needs.&quot;  This time Charles couldn't keep his temper.  &quot;Do you honestly think Crey would admit to stealing your body and go through the effort of working with me, helping me, if this was all a lie?  What would they gain with you being here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I'm here, I'm not in Paragon City as Nightprowl.  I must have been on to something&quot; Cathy said, but she couldn't think of what that could be; she knew in her gut that they were dirty but Crey had always been two or more steps removed from being implicated in any wrongdoing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not that important to them!&quot; he yelled, and Cathy only stared back with a blank look on her face.  &quot;You were one hero in a city of heroes.  Are you that delusional to think that Crey would target you because you're <i>special</i>?  You're neither the most powerful nor most well known hero in Paragon City - you were a common hero, nothing more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I <i>was</i> one hero...?  I <i>was</i> a common hero? Nightprowl is part of who I am, and I will get back to Paragon City soon, and I will keep fighting the good fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going anywhere&quot; Charles replied coldly, with an intensity not previously shown.  &quot;You're staying here until you come to grips with your past.  You have a responsibility to our daughter.  And to me.&quot; Charles' hand slipped into his pocket and around the remote that controlled Cathy's collar.  It pained him so much seeing her standing there, weighing the situation in her mind. Would she attack him?  Could he press the button to stop her?  He loved her; he always did and always would, but if being the bad guy was the only way to keep her from hurting herself, to keep her here, then he had to do it. He couldn't lose her again.  He wouldn't lose her again.<br />
<br />
Cathy just stood there, glaring at Charles and thinking about what he had said.  <i>'You're not that important to them'</i> he said, and he was right.  She had run-ins with Crey, but nothing that would justify this elaborate plan to remove her from Paragon City. <i>'you were a common hero, nothing more.'</i> That hurt, but in all honest was the truth.  There were faster, stronger, and more popular heroes in Paragon City; she was a common soldier in an army of heroes. <i>'You have a responsibility to our daughter.'</i>  She couldn't leave Madison, but if he was telling the truth, if he was her father, then that would complicate things.<br />
<br />
This wasn't an argument that could be won; he had showed his hand to her and it was clear that Charles was going to keep her there for now.  &quot;I'm not hungry.  I'm going to check on Madison.&quot; she said, turning and leaving the room.  Charles relaxed his grip around the remote, relieved that she hadn't forced him do use it, but saddened by the resistance she was giving him.  &quot;I have to show her the video&quot; he muttered to himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
***2***<br />
<br />
<br />
Cathy watched Madison from the doorway, then quietly approached the bars. As she opened the door to Zeus and Magick's cage Madison turned around and smiled.  &quot;Mommy!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi sweetie. How are Zeus and Magick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're happy&quot; she replied, and remembered something she wanted to tell her at the dinner table.  &quot;You look pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy smiled. &quot;Why thank you!  You look pretty too.&quot;  Cathy wanted to get a closer look at Madison's collar, to see if she could find a release.  Their collars looked similar so any release found on Madison's might be on Cathy's as well.  &quot;Madison, could I take a look at your collar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh&quot; she replied, and as Cathy approached Madison reached up to her neck with both hands. Cathy was shocked when the collar popped open.  &quot;How did you do that?&quot; Cathy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just press this here&quot; she replied, pointing at the ruby in the center of the collar near where it had opened.  &quot;Does Daddy know you can do this?&quot; she asked.  Madison laughed. &quot;Yes silly, he showed me how to do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was surprised when Charles spoke up from the other side of the bars.  &quot;I commissioned an artist to create collars for Zeus and Magick, and when Madison saw them she started crying.  She asked me why Zeus and Magick got them and she didn't get one.  I never even considered it.  To make her happy I had the artist make one for her that was better than theirs in every way.  She wears it all the time not because she has to, but because she wants to.  When we knew you would be coming here we used Madison's design as a template, though we added the 'features' that you know about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madison is really your daughter?&quot; Cathy asked, though now she was convinced that she was just a little child running freely around the estate.  &quot;Madison is <b>our</b> daughter&quot; he corrected her.  &quot;I need to show you something, Cathy&quot; he added, making sure to use the name she now went by.  He looked at Madison and said &quot;Madison honey, please stay here and look after the cats for a while.  Simon will come and get you in a bit.&quot;  He turned back to Cathy. &quot;I've removed the restrictions of your collar, but it will activate if to try to leave the estate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy followed Charles into the other wing of the mansion.  He led her to a room in which Simon was waiting with a television and DVD player set up.  Simon handed Cathy a DVD and she inspected it; it appeared to be a recordable disk.  &quot;I was given this with all the other information I showed to you. I was asked not to use it unless it was absolutely necessary.  You went to Paragon City to find your friend, right?&quot;  Cathy nodded.  Though she was able to sweet talk Gerald into believing that she only wanted to go to Paragon City to continue where Trish left off, she was also fiercely determined to find out what happened to her lifelong friend.  &quot;The folder that I gave you is what Crey Industries arranged to make you, and everyone else, think that she died at the hands of the Rikti.  The disk that you hold in your hands will tell you what really happened.  It's the reason why you don't need to go back to Paragon City.  It's the reason why you should stay here and at least try to make an effort to remember your past.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy put the disk in the player and stood back to watch it play.  It began immediately, and in the background Cathy could make out what appeared to be a sterile lab with people going about their work.  In the foreground sat an empty desk.  Within seconds a woman sat down at the desk and Cathy was stunned; it was Trish.  Cathy stared at the screen as tears welled up in her eyes, her jaw went slack, and Cathy let out a painful exhale, trying to find some sort of special effect trickery or evidence that it wasn't really her.  She found none.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Cynthia&quot; Trish started. &quot;If you are watching this then you are with Mr. Monroe and you now know your real name.  My name is not Trish, and for security reasons I cannot tell you my real name.  Trish Jackson was a character I played for your benefit, to check on your progress as a Crey experiment.  My job was to document your lifestyle and report my findings to my superiors.  I was given a promotion that required me to leave your project, so we had to find a way for me to leave without arousing suspicion.  With the Rikti War going on we were able to link Trish Jackson to a hero who's real identity must be kept secret.  Please stop looking for me, I'm not who you think I am and I do not love you.  You were simply a job for me.  I hope you find happiness in your new home, with the people who love you.  Goodbye Cynthia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's alive&quot; Cathy whispered to herself, then turned around to face Charles.  &quot;She's alive!&quot; she elatedly repeated to Charles.  &quot;I have to find her.  She needs my help!&quot;  Charles looked at Cathy with disappointment in his eyes.  &quot;Didn't you listen to anything she said?  She's not who you think she is - you were a job for her!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy's mood darkened.  &quot;She's being forced to say those things - or maybe she's being brainwashed; I don't know. But I know she's my friend and she needs my help now more than ever.  For the first time in years I now know she's still alive and I will find her.&quot;  Charles shook his head and cracks began forming in his emotional state.  He wiped the beginnings of a tear from his face, but it came over him like a wave and he began to sob. &quot;I failed you.  I failed you back then, and I'm failing you now.  I'm pathetic.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few moments of Charles sobbing, Cathy reluctantly spoke up.  &quot;You're <i>not</i> pathetic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am&quot; Charles replied.  &quot;I couldn't save you five years ago, and I suddenly get a second chance and I'm doing a poor job trying to save you now.  I can't even get you to consider the remote possibility that you're you, even with all this evidence.&quot; he swiped at the papers on the table, scattering them to the floor.  &quot;I just want you back, so it could be like before!  That's all I've ever wanted!  Is that so wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was hard for Cathy to watch Charles unravel.  She felt a bit ashamed, unwilling to consider that he might not be lying to her. If she was really his wife, and if Madison was their daughter, and if Trish wasn't really her lifelong friend, then Cathy Watts would be the lie and Cynthia Monroe would be the truth. It couldn't be though; she would have remembered something, anything.  <i>'Like the connection you felt with Madison?'</i> a voice in her head questioned.  Doubt crept into her mind, but she saw Charles' fragile emotional state and decided she might not get a chance like this again, a moment of weakness where he might release her. With a soft, compassionate voice Cathy spoke up. &quot;Charles, I can't consider myself anything other than a prisoner here.  You have to let me go, please.  Then I can consider what you're saying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm pathetic, but I'm not stupid&quot; Charles replied, his sobbing voice taking the sting off the remark.  &quot;The first thing you did when after waking up was try to leave.  Then you tried to escape through Zeus' and Magick's room.  Then you destroyed a camera.  The only thing that's keeping you from leaving is the collar around your neck.&quot;  He looked Cathy straight in the eye, and a sense of strength emerged from his voice.  &quot;I won't fail you this time.  I promise.  You will know that you were Cynthia Monroe, so you can make the proper decision.  I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I wasn't sure that you made your decision only after becoming completely aware of who you really are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was puzzled at Charles' statement. &quot;What decision?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to know right now that regardless of your choice, you will always be welcomed here. But you do have to make the decision of who you want to be.  Your future.  You have your past as Cathy Watts, and while right now you don't acknowledge it, you also have your real past as Cynthia Monroe.  To choose right now is assuring that Cathy Watts would win, right?&quot;  Her downward glance was all the admission he needed.  &quot;If I lose you again I need it to be an informed decision, one not done out of haste or fear of the unknown.  I would give up my empire to have you back.  If I had you and Madison, and not a penny to my name, I would be a happy man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Charles, I don't remember!  Even if I was her, she's been erased from my mind&quot;<br />
<br />
The first admission from Cathy, <i>'even if I was her...'</i>, elated Charles more that she could have expected.  &quot;That's why I have this&quot; he replied, holding up a small vial.  &quot;It's a drug.  I was told that this will help you to remember.  I was supposed to just put it in your food, then simply start talking about your past to help re-tune your brain to your old memories.  I didn't put it in your food because it's our decision to make together, not mine to make alone.  Maybe in the back of my mind I wanted you to remember me without the aid of drugs.  Maybe I was foolish to think that you would look at me and instantly all your fond memories would come flooding back.&quot;  Charles cleared his throat, choked up with memories of his own.  &quot;I'm giving this bottle to you - I would appreciate it greatly if you tried it, but I won't force it on you.  It's your decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to think&quot; Cathy replied, taking the vial from Charles, an avalanche of 'what ifs' tumbling through her mind.  &quot;I'm going back to my room for the night.  Would you mind leaving the television set up the way it is now?  I'd like to take another look at it tomorrow after I've had time to absorb... everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles nodded, and Cathy gave a painful smile and left the room.  She walked back to her room in a bit of a haze, uncertain of her past, present, and future. She sat down on her bed and fixated on the vial she held in her hand.  Cathy stared at it, wondering about the liquid inside.  <i>'It'll help you remember'</i> he had said.  She rose from the bed and walked to the bathroom, intending on pouring the drug down the sink.  She opened the vial and looked down into basin, then looked at herself in the mirror.  <i>'Who are you?'</i> she thought to herself.  &quot;I don't know&quot; was her response.  She looked at the vial, a small bottle of clear liquid that could hold all her answers.  She replace the cap and placed it on the counter - she was too tired to make such an important decision tonight.<br />
<br />
<br />
***3***<br />
<br />
<br />
Cathy slept in fits through the night, dreaming about her past and about Trish, and wondering what was real and what was manufactured.  When she and Trish were kids playing &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, trying to jump off the roof of Trish's house while holding a large umbrella - how Cathy twisted her ankle on the landing and had to go to the hospital, and how they covered it up saying that she had tripped and fell down the stairs.  How Trish had visited her when The Nightprowler was first opened and had seemed so happy for her.  The day she got the terrible news that Trish had died.  The day Gerald told her 'the truth' about Trish.  All of it was now supposed to be lies and deceptions, and Cathy had nothing to fill the void.  She woke up just after 5 o'clock in the morning, feeling just as tired as when she had gone to bed.<br />
<br />
After staring at the ceiling for ten minutes she decided to get moving.  She changed into her sweat pants and t-shirt, then decided to take a tour of the other wing now that she had access to the entire house - maybe she could find an exercise room and exhaust herself into getting some sleep. She didn't get far into the tour before she found herself back in the same room as the night before, looking at the blank television screen.  She was drawn towards it and turned it on, then started the disk.  Once again Trish sat down at the table and began speaking, halting as Cathy pressed the pause button.  Cathy looked over every inch of the screen, trying to convince herself that the woman on the screen wasn't Trish, but only convincing herself that she was.  &quot;I can't deal with this now&quot; she muttered, getting up and walking out the door, leaving Trish paused in mid sentence.<br />
<br />
She walked down the hall and hit the jackpot when she came to a door labelled 'Exercise Room'.  She opened it and smiled as she found much of the similar equipment to what she had purchased for The Nightprowler, though without the beefed up structure and extra weight loadout she requested for hers (many mutants had larger, more developed muscles than what 'normals' possessed, so they needed special equipment).  While Cathy noted that the leg press machine didn't have enough weight to give her a serious challenge, the upper body equipment would be fine, as her upper body musculature was only moderately stronger than a non-mutant woman.<br />
<br />
She started rotating around the stations, using her normal weight loadout for the upper body stations and the full rack for the leg stations.  After an hour she'd worked up a good sweat when she heard the soft crack of a bottle cap being unscrewed.  After finishing her set she raised up from the bench press and looked at a familiar face, the face that started this whole ordeal - the young delivery man who had drugged her and abducted her to this place.  Cathy thought he must've been in his late teens or early twenties, and he seemed to exude an inner confidence about himself.  He had a trim, athletic body and a boyish smile. &quot;What?  No flowers for me this time?&quot; Cathy asked dryly.<br />
<br />
He smiled. &quot;No, not this time.  Here's a bottle of water though - you look like you've worked up a good sweat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Women don't sweat&quot; Cathy remarked<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right, they glow.  Well, you're 'glowing' profusely and you should keep yourself properly hydrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked at him suspiciously, but he was quick to answer her look. &quot;I've no reason not to act civil around you; you're my boss' wife.  Besides, that's a beautiful looking collar around your neck&quot;, a not too subtle reminder that she wasn't going anywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your nose looks painful&quot; Cathy replied, a straight counter to the collar comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, yes&quot; he replied, lightly touching his broken nose.  &quot;You surprised me when you didn't go down immediately; the tranquilizer dart was <i>supposed</i> to be instantaneous.  I can't fault you for fighting back - I would've done the same thing.  My name's Nicholas by the way; everybody just calls me 'Nick'.  No hard feelings?&quot; He held out a water bottle in lieu of shaking hands, and Cathy took it.  She glanced at the bottle, noting the safety seal was intact.  She unscrewed the cap and as the water hit her lips she realized how thirsty she was.  &quot;What do you do here, Nick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm part of a combat suit project that Mr. Monroe's funding, but we're having some technical issues so I'll be here for the next week or so until it gets all sorted out.  I'd be happy to be your training partner if you'd like - spot you on some weights, push you to your limits, and stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you're not going to try to convince me that I'm Charles' dead wife reborn as a mutant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frankly, I don't care who you think you are; it's none of my business.  From what I've heard the DNA tests say you're her, but if you don't believe in DNA then there isn't much anyone can do about it. If you'd like, I could help you try to remember bits and pieces - worst case scenario is that you remember nothing, and you're already at that point now, aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you gain by helping me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brownie points from the boss; maybe I could hit him up for a raise&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Though I guess 'The warm feeling of helping a beautiful woman regain her past memories' would have been a better answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Cathy smiled. &quot;I would've seen through that answer a mile away.  I'm done for the morning - the exercise room is all yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.  By the way, it looks like you left the DVD on.  I wasn't sure if I should be touching your stuff so I left it alone, but you might want to turn it off before you head for breakfast&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I was looking at it this morning&quot; she replied quietly, it still being a sore spot for her. &quot; I'll go turn it off.&quot;  She chugged the rest of the bottle and tossed it into the trash, then headed to turn off the video equipment.<br />
<br />
<br />
***4***<br />
<br />
<br />
She meant to turn it off, but as she looked at the screen she felt compelled to play it again. She played the entire message over several times, and it struck her even more powerfully than the night before, but in a different way.  The cold message hid an underlying passion she didn't see before.  While last night Cathy had thought Trish had somehow been forced to make the message, this morning her words seemed to ring true.  This was not a woman being forced to say something against her will, it was a woman simply telling her an unflattering truth.<br />
<br />
With a heavy heart Cathy turned off the television and after changing out of her workout clothes and having a shower she went to the kitchen for breakfast.  Simon was making breakfast.  &quot;You're up bright and early this morning, milady&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had trouble sleeping last night; I've been up for a couple hours already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is there anything I can get for you?  I've got some freshly squeezed orange juice in the fridge, or I could fix you some warm milk if you'd like to head back to bed for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some orange juice would be great.&quot; Cathy replied. As Simon was pouring her a glass Cathy spoke up with something that had been on her mind. &quot;Simon?  Do you think I'm her?  That I'm Cynthia? I mean you were her butler; you have to have a feeling one way or another.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon handed her the glass of orange juice and looked into her eyes.  &quot;Milady, I thought about it for a long time after Mr. Monroe told me about you, and I'm of the opinion that even if you were her, you stopped being her when you died five years ago.  You no longer act like her, you no longer talk like her, and you no longer recognize yourself as being her.  It is only for Madison's sake that I accepted Mr. Monroe's decision to take you from Paragon City, though I feel he is doing it for a more selfish reason.  He still hasn't gotten over Cynthia's death five years ago.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But why didn't he just tell me? He could have told me what he suspected without kidnapping me&quot; Cathy suggested, loading up a plate with the eggs, sausages, and hash browns Simon was making.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't mean to argue the point milady, but honestly how would you have reacted if Mr. Monroe simply walked up to you one day and said 'I've been stalking you for months now, and after running some tests I've found that you're my wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point taken.  What's the saying? 'If you're poor you're crazy, but if you're rich you're eccentric'.  I would've labelled Charles eccentric on the spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you label him now, milady?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy thought for a moment.  &quot;Misguided.  Confused.  I want to be able to call him a vile and despicable person, but I can't.  I understand why he thinks he's doing the right thing, but I can't agree with him.  I'm still a prisoner here and I have friends who I want so desperately to contact to tell them I'm not hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Milady, you have my word that you will be able to contact them in due time.  At the moment Mr. Monroe's greatest fear is that you will ignore his assertion that you were Cynthia Monroe by clinging to what is familiar to you.  By bringing you here Mr. Monroe feels that you have the best chance to remember your past as Cynthia.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'Cynthia'</i> Cathy thought, the name mulling around in her head, seeming more familiar than before, as if long forgotten brain pathways were being used once again.  The base instincts that yesterday were telling her that she was Cathy and couldn't be Cynthia were muted, eerily quiet. <i>'What if I am Cynthia? I'd have an obligation to my past.  I'd have an obligation to Madison.'</i>  &quot;One week&quot; she announced.  &quot;In one week you'll help me contact Gerald to tell him I'm okay, and to tell him I will see him after I've found out... after I've found out who I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed. One week.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Lifted by her agreement with Simon, Cathy headed into the dining room to eat.  Charles was sitting at the table; his breakfast was still untouched and he was reading a newspaper.  &quot;Good morning&quot; Cathy said, taking a seat near Charles instead of the usual seat on the opposite side of the table.  Charles was surprised and after wishing her a good morning he responded by folding the paper and starting on his breakfast.  He could tell that something was on her mind; she seemed unsure and lost in thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; he asked.  Cathy looked down at her plate, not sure if she should start the line of thought that was mulling around in her head.  She couldn't seem to stop herself from asking the question.  &quot;Do you have pictures of me... I mean of me, <i>before</i>...&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles looked at her with a bit of puzzlement, then understood what she was trying to ask.  &quot;Oh, yes.  Yes I do!&quot; he answered, his hands seemingly finding a life of their own and Charles quickly pulled back from the table in a rush to fill Cathy's wishes.  &quot;I've got some photo albums in my office.  I'll go get them.  Don't move, I'll be right back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles brought back four albums; he and Cathy began to go through the first album which contained pictures from an early time in the relationship. <i>'She looks exactly like me'</i> Cathy thought.  Charles described each photograph, including several of Cynthia's parents.  &quot;Are they still alive?&quot; Cathy asked; in her past as Cathy her father left her while she was still a baby, and her mother was taken from her seven years ago in an automobile accident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  They're both alive and well.  I... I haven't told them about you... yet.  I didn't want them to get their hopes up considering the chances you'll regain anything but a small portion of your memories is remote.  They would want to be parents to you in a time when you may not want to be parented by strangers.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought that she might have two loving parents alive and well warmed her, it was so different than a father she never knew and the tragic loss of her mother.  They continued through the first album, Charles fondly describing each picture in great detail.  When they got to the end of the album Charles began to open the second but Cathy stopped him, deciding that she wanted to take a break.  It was so much information to absorb.<br />

After breakfast Cathy decided to take a walk around the estate grounds, happy to be outside for the first time since she arrived.  Patches of threatening storm clouds glided through stunningly blue sky, and as the sun emerged from the clouds Cathy was enveloped in warmth.  The grass and flowers were immaculate, and the water in the pool rippled with the breeze. Cathy spotted a gazebo in the distance and decided to head towards it, figuring that it would be a nice place to sit, relax, and think.  The gazebo overlooked the estate's private beach, and three boats were moored to a dock stretching out to the sea.  The thought came to her that she could take one of the boats and try to escape, but Cathy didn't like water in the best of conditions, and the thought of being paralysed on the deck of a speeding boat scared her.  With Cynthia tugging at her mind she quickly dismissed the idea and looked skyward.<br />
<br />
The threatening clouds had gathered, and as Cathy was considering heading back inside, the rain came down suddenly and heavily.   With her dislike of water and the realization that the sundress she was wearing would become quite embarrassingly transparent should it get wet, Cathy decided to wait out the storm under the cover of the gazebo. She closed her eyes and listened to the rhythmic tapping on the roof and the stone path, and her lack of sleep finally caught up to her.  She let her catlike instincts take over and curled up on the floor of the gazebo for an impromptu nap.<br />
<br />
She began to dream, but instead of dreaming about her life, she began dreaming about Cynthia's.  The pictures from the album Charles had shown her re-appeared as moving images.  So lifelike, so real, as if she was there. She went with the dream, jumping from images of her sunbathing at poolside, to her and Charles in Paris, and then to her and Charles on an african safari vacation.  She felt Charles' hands around her waist, his tender and loving touch, and felt his lips on hers.  It felt normal.  It felt right.  Cathy stirred and stretched, and the tapping of the rain brought her out of her dream, where she found Simon waiting for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm&quot; Cathy groaned, stretching again and rising from the gazebo floor.  &quot;Why didn't you wake me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were purring, milady.  Madison doesn't like it when I wake her up while she's purring, so I figured you'd be the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy didn't like the thought that Simon had discovered a catlike feature of hers that even she didn't know about. &quot;I don't purr.  Cats purr, and I'm not a cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well milady, I must have been mistaken.  When I saw that you were out here I came out to escort you back to the manor.&quot;  Simon pointed the umbrella outwards and opened it, then raised it to cover the exit.  Cathy thanked him and stepped down, wrapping her tail around her waist to avoid getting it wet, and walked with Simon back to the manor.  Cathy got into a comfortable rhythm for the rest of the day, helping Simon with lunch, baking muffins as a treat for Madison, and later watching Madison play with Zeus and Magick.  When Madison went to her room for an afternoon nap, Cathy decided to lounge by the pool and reflect back on her thoughts of the day.  She began to feel content, her thoughts of her past as Cynthia continued to make their presence known, louder, more intense, more real.  She began mulling the name around in her head; <i>'Cynthia... Cynthia.  Cynthia is a nice name'</i> she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
In a change from the regular routine Cathy ate dinner with Nick and Madison, as Simon explained that Charles was off on an important business matter and wouldn't be back until the following night.  After reading Madison a bedtime story and tucking her in for the night, Cathy went through some of the other photo albums and began to feel a connection with the photos, as if she were remembering a forgotten past.  She began accepting Cynthia as a real person, with just as much right to exist as the memories she knew from her past as Cathy.  She began to wonder whether she would have to choose; Cathy or Cynthia.  Could they both exist inside her, or would one have to take control?<br />
<br />
Throughout the night her sleep did nothing but confuse the matter further, her thoughts of Cynthia continuing to pick away at her past as Cathy.  In the morning through muddled thoughts she decided she needed to think, to work things out in her mind and she knew where she did her best thinking.  She changed into her workout clothes, headed to the exercise room, and went straight to the treadmill.  She started it up and kept pushing it faster and faster until it topped out at 30 miles per hour.  Cathy entered her zone and while her muscles pulsed to a repetitious beat, her mind was forced into a more primal train of thought.<br />
<br />
<br />
***6***<br />
<br />
<br />
Nick woke up early that day; he had work to do.  He turned on his computer and called up the floorplan of the estate.  The red dot marking his subject was on the move. <i>'Early riser'</i> he noted to himself. The dot moved around her room, and then out into the hallway.  It moved purposefully towards the exercise room where it entered and went directly to one corner.  <i>'She's using the treadmill'</i> Nick noted.<br />
<br />
After writing his report on the slow progress regarding the subject, he showered and dressed in his workout clothes, then checked the subject once more; she was still on the treadmill.  <i>'What a pain in the butt'</i> he thought to himself.  <i>'All that stupid moron had to do was follow the instructions given to him and I wouldn't have this mess on my hands.  Prepping her with the drug yesterday; giving her the full dose today.  She would've been Cynthia by now if he'd just followed the damn instructions.  At least he's not here to screw up this part of the job.'</i><br />
<br />
He opened a dresser drawer and pulled out a couple tainted bottles of water, glanced at himself in the mirror and practised his opening line.  &quot;You really should keep yourself properly hydrated - the heat down here can wear you out quickly.  Here's bottle of water if you want.&quot;  He then flashed his smile; he loved his smile, the boyish charm, the innocence and sincerity it exuded. In his head he went over the instructions he was given by his superiors. <i>'Be confident in what you say but don't be confrontational. Use her emotions.  Plant the seed and let the drug do its work.'</i><br />
<br />
Nick checked his laptop a final time then shut it down and prepared for the Big Day; the day where he would make Cathy Watts believe she was Cynthia Monroe.  As he walked down the hall he heard the beat of heavy footfalls, and when he entered the exercise room he was surprised at what he saw.  Cathy was still on the treadmill, but she was sprinting at what must surely be full speed, as he'd never seen anyone run so fast.  Sweat gleamed from her face, her shirt was soaked, and drops flew from her hands and tail with every powerful stride. Nick walked closer into Cathy's peripheral vision and glanced at the treadmill's computer; it read 27.4 miles travelled.<br />
<br />
<i>'This is perfect'</i> Nick thought to himself. Cathy's physical exhaustion would only lower her resistance to the effects of the drug. He glanced around and noted an empty bottle of water on the floor, discarded as a long distance runner would discard a drink in mid-stride.  He didn't even bother with the line he'd practiced; he held out the bottle and she took it with a simple 'thanks'.  She dialed the treadmill down to half-speed, cracked open the cap and chugged the bottle, discarding it in the same manner as her previous bottle of water as she returned to full speed.  Nick simply watched her run, amazed at how fast she was moving.<br />
<br />
After a minute Nick spoke up.  &quot;He bought that for you, Cynthia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Cathy grunted, being pulled out of the zone of concentration she'd spent the good part of an hour.<br />
<br />
Nick wasn't sure if he should risk calling her Cynthia again before the drug started to take full effect.  &quot;I said Charles bought that treadmill especially for you.  That's why it can go that fast.  He loves you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know&quot; she curtly replied, then felt she had to correct herself.  &quot;I mean I know he loves me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madison loves you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
A surge of emotion went through Cathy with that statement, and she dialed down the speed on the treadmill.  &quot;Yes.  I love her as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a short pause Nick spoke up. &quot;She's your daughter&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My daughter&quot; Cathy quietly replied, those words weighing heavily on her.  Nick made himself look busy on a piece of exercise equipment, watching Cathy, waiting for the drug to get her in its grasp.  After several minutes he felt the time was right.  Nick carefully chose his next statement.  &quot;Madison's mother is Cynthia Monroe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy said nothing, but Nick could see her mind struggling with the concept.  If she didn't admit to being Cynthia Monroe, she couldn't claim to be Madison's mother - it was a package deal.  She was still running at a pace faster than a human could tolerate but well within her limits.  Nick reached over and slowed the treadmill until it came to a stop.  Cathy just stood in the middle with her head hung and her chest heaving with each breath.  Her eyes stared through the floor, and her mind was still running as hard as her muscles were only minutes before. Nick knew this was the moment, the time where she would be vulnerable enough to be pushed into her new role.  He took Cathy's hand and flashed his smile.  &quot;You're Madison's mother.  You are Cynthia Monroe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm... I'm...&quot; Cathy started, but she couldn't seem to find her name.  She wanted to still be running, but Nick's other hand was covering the treadmill's controls and she didn't want to create a scene.  She suddenly didn't have the energy to create a scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madison loves her mother.  She loves Cynthia Monroe, and you are Cynthia Monroe.  She loves you very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She loves me&quot; Cathy replied with a hollow, unsure voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are Cynthia Monroe and you love your daughter very much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I love Madison.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was primed and ready, Nick could see it in her eyes and in her posture.  &quot;I want you to say it with me.  'My name is Cynthia Monroe and I love my daughter'.&quot;  Before Cathy could think, the words trickled from her mouth in a quiet breath. &quot;My name is Cynthia Monroe and I love my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again&quot;<br />
<br />
The words came out with more authority, more certainty this time. &quot;My name is Cynthia Monroe and I love my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick dialed up the softness and sincerity of his voice one more notch, and looked Cathy straight in the eyes.  &quot;You are such a lucky woman, Cynthia.  You have a daughter who loves you, a husband who loves you, and you live in a beautiful home.  You must be the luckiest woman in the world.&quot;  He gave Cathy the second bottle of water, but he saw in her eyes that she was hooked.  It would only be a matter of time until the superheightened suggestions Nick had just implanted tore away at true memories.  Cathy just stood there, unsure of what to do next until Nick jump started her back into her daily routine.  &quot;Cynthia, Why don't you go and shower, then go have breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I need a shower&quot; she agreed.  She stepped off the treadmill and headed back to her room.<br />
<br />
<br />
***7***<br />
<br />
<br />
Throughout the day Cathy became more at peace with her situation.  She was remembering a past as Cynthia, and she knew she was among people who cared for her.  The drug was morphing and molding the photo albums' images, Charles' statements, and Nick's suggestions into a false past, one that she was believing as being real. Memories which would slowly be filled in by her subconscious, adding its own falsehoods to properly mend her patchwork past. She knew she had a daughter who loved her, a husband who loved her, and she lived in a beautiful home.  She felt like the luckiest woman in the world.<br />
<br />
Evening came and Simon informed her that Charles would be present for dinner, so she went through her closet, deciding what to wear.  After flipping through several dresses she was drawn to one of them.  <i>'Oh, that's the one I wore in Paris'</i> she thought.  <i>'Charles loved that dress.'</i>  She put on the dress and accompanying heels, then fished through her jewelry box to find the bracelets she also wore that night in Paris.  She put on some makeup and admired herself in a full length mirror,  twirling around and feeling more and more like a lady.  She felt like she was back in Paris.  She entered the dining room smiling, and Charles was stunned by her beauty.  &quot;Do you remember this dress?&quot; she asked, hoping he would.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I forget, you wore that in Paris.  You look beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy seemed eager to initiate the conversation, asking questions about their past together.  &quot;What was the best part about our trip to Paris?&quot;  &quot;What animals did we see in Africa?&quot; &quot;When we went to Athens did we see the Parthenon?&quot;  Charles found it hard to contain his happiness and he answered each question as well as he could, elated by the fact that she had started to use 'we' and 'I' when talking about her past.  It was the first time in over five years that Charles felt that he was having dinner with the woman he vowed to love for the rest of his life. When they had finished their meal Simon cleared the table, and Charles spoke up.  &quot;Would you like something for desert, Cathy?&quot; he innocently asked.<br />
<br />
Surprise suddenly overtook her and she blurted out a reply. &quot;My name is...&quot; <i>'...Cynthia Monroe and I love my daughter'</i> she stopped short of saying out loud, and reeled in the sudden shock of what she almost said. &quot;Cathy&quot; she quietly replied.  &quot;Yes, my name's Cathy.&quot;  She couldn't hide the pale look on her face and Charles became concerned.  &quot;Cathy, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'Cathy.  My name is Cathy.  Why would I think I'm Cynthia?'</i> she questioned herself.  It took a few seconds to collect her thoughts, but a false smile came to her face and she politely replied  &quot;I'm okay Charles.  Yes, I would love some desert.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was eerily quiet during desert, the polar opposite of how she acted during the meal.  Inside she was fighting herself, questioning why she would so completely embrace Cynthia's past and disregard her own as Cathy. Halfway through her desert it finally dawned on her; <i>'They drugged me'</i>.  She began to sift through the pie with her fork, lightly sniffing the food but trying not to draw attention.  She didn't know what she expected to smell or see, but she knew she wasn't thinking properly; the 'memories' of Cynthia seemed to be forcing themselves on her, pushing aside her past as Cathy.  She was about to announce that she was going to bed early when Charles spoke up.  &quot;Would you like to take an evening walk with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy felt that she needed to play along, make them think that the drug still had control over her mind, so she accepted.  She tried to act interested in Cynthia's past and in Charles, but she was still fighting with the drug in her mind.  Had Charles not been so desperate to believe that Cathy was beginning to regain her memories he might have seen through the charade, but he hung on every word and was eager to please her however he could.<br />
<br />
Cathy tried to figure out her next step; she needed to eat eventually, but she couldn't let them drug her.  She thought about Charles giving her a vial of the drug, and she couldn't understand why he'd do that if he was just going to drug her anyway. <i>'Simon.  He did it'</i> she thought to herself. <i>'He makes the deal about contacting Gerald just to appease me, then drugs me to make me forget, and to make me believe I'm Cynthia.  Charles is happy, Madison is happy, and I stay here.  It makes sense - he prepares all the meals, so it's easy for him to drug me.'</i>  She wondered whether Charles knew Simon was drugging her, or whether he acted on his own in order to please him, but she knew it didn't matter; she had to be careful and she had to find a way to eat without being drugged.<br />
<br />
When Cathy returned to her room after the walk with Charles, she noted a bottle of water on her dresser.  It was the same bottle of water Nick had given her that morning.  She looked at the cap - its seal was intact.  She then began peeling away the label, and that's when she saw it - a small hole, apparently patched with epoxy.  She took the bottle into the bathroom and opened the vial Charles had given her, the same drug which Cathy suspected was still in her system.  Using her highly sensitive nose she smelled the drug, trying to find a clear scent to identify.  <i>'There it is'</i> she thought, noting a slight aroma, most likely imperceptible by human standards, but definitely detectable by Cathy's genetically superior sense of smell.  She opened the bottle Nick had given her and sniffed the water.  It was hard to pick up, but the scent was there - the water was spiked with the drug.<br />
<br />
She had to plan her strategy for the next day.  Nick had drugged her, but Cathy wondered whether he was acting alone.  Because Charles willingly gave her a bottle of the drug, and was the one who seemed to trigger her real memories simply by reminding her of her real name, she had little doubt that he wasn't involved in her drugging.  Nick was involved, but what about Simon?  She began thinking of ways to get Nick to reveal himself and ways in which Simon's guilt or innocence could be judged based on his actions.  Cathy was beginning to get a handle on the situation, and she thought that hopefully she could discover everyone's true intentions and straighten out exactly why she was brought here. <i>'Now if only I could get this damn collar off my neck.'</i><br />
<br />
<br />
***8***<br />
<br />
<br />
It was about 2 o'clock in the morning when Cathy awoke from a restless sleep.  The thoughts of Cynthia's past were manageable, but still disturbingly invasive in Cathy's mind.  She slipped out of bed and headed out of her room, determined to go over Trish's message once again to make sure that her first gut feeling was correct and that she was a prisoner of Crey.  She replayed the video several times, watching Trish coldly go through her lines - there was no concern or passion in her voice, it was hollow, her will seemed broken.  She was a prisoner saying what she was told to say, of that Cathy was now positive.<br />
<br />
As she was going through the message one more time, she heard a noise from behind.  She spun around to see Nick standing in the doorway.  &quot;I didn't mean to startle you&quot; he said.  &quot;I was awake and heard a noise, so I decided to take a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn't sleep&quot; Cathy stated, dubious of his excuse for being awake, and turning to face the television to avoid Nick reading her expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was about to raid the fridge.  Would you like something to drink?&quot; Nick replied<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you&quot; Cathy replied without turning around, restarting the video.  The video played in front of her, but her attention was squarely on Nick behind her.  She felt Nick walk into the room, he was studying her, she could feel it, she knew he was trying to decide whether the drug still had her under control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cynthia&quot; he spoke up.<br />
<br />
<i>'He's testing me.'</i> She glanced over her shoulder and replied &quot;Uh-huh?&quot;, quickly turning back to feign interest in the video.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, I was just repeating what your friend on the video said - she called you Cynthia.  Cynthia is a nice name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Cathy replied, wondering if she might have gone too far in making him think the drug had changed her.  The hairs on her arms and neck prickled with concern, and only the fact that her back was turned to Nick allowed her to hide her reaction.<br />
<br />
After a few more seconds of observing Cathy, Nick was convinced.  &quot;Alright, I'm heading to bed.  Goodnight Cynthia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight&quot; she replied, but this time she composed herself, turned her head and smiled, then gave Nick a quick wave before turning back to the television. Cathy decided she needed to search Nick's room, to see if anything incriminating could be found.<br />
<br />
The next morning Simon had informed Cathy that he needed to head into town for supplies, and Cathy devised a way to spend a few minutes searching Nick's room without fear of him walking in.  She skipped her morning workout, the workout in which Nick most certainly would have tried to drug her, and after breakfast took Madison out by the pool to relax.  While Madison played, Cathy read a novel and sipped an iced tea, waiting for Nick to come by.  It wasn't very long before he showed up.  &quot;Hi Nick, I'm glad your here.  Simon went into town for the day so I'm looking after Madison.  Could you keep an eye on her for a few minutes while I go inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, sure&quot; he replied uncertainly, looking over at Madison playing with her red ball.  He didn't seem enthused about the prospect, but Cathy knew he'd agree if only because it would give him the opportunity to drug her drink while she was gone.<br />
<br />
Cathy walked into the manor, and once out of eyeshot lept through the hallways at a rapid pace. Arriving at Nick's door she opened it and cautiously peered in, just in case.  It was smaller than Cathy's room and not as expensively furnished, but it had a large window overlooking an immaculately landscaped lawn.  She didn't have much time so she got down to business, sniffing the air for the scent of the drug and finding it quite easily.  It appeared to be emanating from a dresser.  She opened the drawers one by one, and in the third drawer she found what she was looking for - two vials identical to the one Charles had given her, as well as a syringe laying beside them.  There were also three bottles of water laid on their side and with their labels carefully removed.  A dab of epoxy covered a small puncture hole in each bottle.<br />
<br />
<i>'That's how he did it'</i> Cathy thought to herself.  <i>'He used the syringe to spike the water, sealed the bottle with the epoxy, then hid his tampering by covering it with the bottle's label.'</i>  She wanted to search the room for more evidence but with the knowledge that she had to be poolside before Nick got suspicious she quickly made sure to put everything back as she'd found it then headed out to the pool, making a quick detour through the kitchen.  When Cathy walked back to the pool Nick was surprised to see that she had another iced tea in her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you going to finish this one first?&quot; he asked, holding up the drink he'd so carefully spiked while Madison wasn't looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the ice cubes have already melted in that one.&quot; She wanted to mention to Nick that she'd started taking the 'medicine' Charles had given her so that he would think that she was still under the effect of the drug, but she didn't want to bring it up herself as Nick might be suspicious of her blurting out something like that.  Cathy was patient, and it paid off.<br />
<br />
After minutes of silence, as Nick and Cathy were sunbathing by the pool, Nick spoke up. &quot;You seem much more comfortable today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do feel more comfortable. I decided to try to medicine Charles gave me and boy does it work - just after one conversation with him I started to remember things about my past.  Did you know that we went on an african safari and got chased by an elephant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No - it must have been exciting&quot; Nick replied<br />
<br />
<br />
***9***<br />
<br />
<br />
They had a light conversation while relaxing at poolside, though all the while Cathy was thinking up a way to get Nick to reveal whether Simon was involved in her drugging.  When she thought she had a plan that might work, she put it into action.  &quot;Oh, by the way, I decided to take your advice, Nick&quot; Cathy remarked, knowing that suggesting he was the one who helped her uncover the truth would grate on him.  Nick waited for her to continue, but after a few seconds of silence he finally spoke up.  &quot;My advice?  I don't understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said if I don't believe in DNA then there isn't much anyone can do about it, but I remembered that if my past was manufactured, those soccer matches I played on TV would show someone else in goal, not me.  I don't know if you know this, but before I turned into a mutant I was playing for Canada's under 16 girl's national soccer team&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you found a tape of your championship match?  The one where you supposedly turned into a mutant?&quot; Nick asked, knowing full well that his superiors had tracked down the tapes from the broadcast companies and eliminated any possibility that she'd be able to find the matches she needed.<br />
<br />
Cathy had a feeling that her bluff had to be obscure but plausible, something that people wouldn't think to look for, and she remembered a european trip several weeks before that championship tournament where she played in front of TV cameras.  She had no idea where the tapes would be, but it didn't matter for this bluff.  &quot;No, that championship match brings back bad memories for me.  We had a several televised matches on a european trip we did several weeks before the tournament you're thinking of.  Simon was able to track down a couple of those games and that was part of the reason he headed into town today.  They're in Spanish so I won't be able to understand them, but I should still be able to see if I'm the one playing goal.  He's picking up the tapes from the local post office. Actually, he should be back shortly.&quot;  Cathy knew that if they were in it together, Nick wouldn't have to worry about Simon.  If Nick was acting alone, he'd surely try to stop Simon from showing her the tapes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come get me when you're ready to watch them&quot; Nick uncomfortably replied. &quot;I always love a good sporting event.&quot;  He then got up from the lounge chair and stated &quot;Well, I don't want to get a sunburn, so I think I'll head inside for a while. See ya later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy gave him a head start before making her way to his room. She quietly snuck down the hallway and stopped beside Nick's open door.  She listened to him talking to somebody.  &quot;You're not LISTENING to me!  She found some tapes of her old soccer matches!  This is bad. I can't have her finding out she's not his wife; it'll screw up everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
She finally had the confirmation she needed of who she really was and what was a lie.  She listened intently as Nick continued the conversation.  &quot;You gotta do what you gotta do... make it look like a robbery, but if you can't find it then you're gonna have to force him to tell you where it is... yes, if you ask him about the tapes you're going to have to kill him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy quietly skipped a breath at the thought; by bluffing Nick she found that Simon wasn't involved in her drugging, but she'd just put him in harm's way and now they might kill him - no, they <i>would</i> kill him because there weren't any tapes to find.  She didn't have time to consider her options when Madison's red rubber ball bounced past her.  Cathy looked back from where it came and saw Madison gleefully bounding down the hallway.  In a rush she grabbed Madison and covered her mouth, quietly shushing her, hoping that Nick didn't hear anything.  Hope died when the rubber ball hit a table leg with a thud.  Cathy held Madison close in silence, praying that Nick would pick up the conversation where he left off.  He didn't.<br />
<br />
Nick heard a thump out in the hallway and paused.  &quot;I gotta go.  Get moving - I want those tapes destroyed&quot; he said into the phone before turning to his laptop and flipping it open.  It was already on the estate floorplan, and Cathy's red light sat stationary just outside his room.  He checked his pocket for the item he knew he'd eventually need.  It was there.  &quot;Cynthia?&quot; he called out in a friendly voice. &quot;Cynthia, I know you're there.  Come in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy whispered into Madison's ear.  &quot;Sweetie, I need you to go get help.  Find your daddy and bring him here.  Quick, go-go&quot; she said, pushing her back down the hall to get her moving.  Madison looked back once but Cathy shooed her away quickly and she was off to find Charles.  Cathy took a deep breath then stepped into the open doorway, arms akimbo and a stern look on her face.  &quot;It's over Nick.  Tell your friends that Simon doesn't matter any more, because I know the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick just smiled.  &quot;Hello Cathy.  To be perfectly honest I'm kind of glad you found out; it gives me a chance to make my mark and climb up the corporate ladder.  Being known within Crey Industries as a 'Hero Killer' tends to speed up the advancement of one's career exponentially.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself Nick?  If you tell me everything you know right now, I won't have to hurt you.  I don't care about you, I just want to know where Crey is holding Trish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick shook his head in disappointment. &quot;Trish this, Trish that... you're a broken record.  Don't you realize that your relentless pursuit of your friend is about to get you killed?&quot;  Cathy knew something wasn't right.   Nick had to know that in a one-on-one fight he stood no chance against her, but he was acting cocky and arrogant, virtually daring her to try and beat him to a pulp and doing a good job of it. She scanned the room for anything out of the ordinary. She sniffed the air for an unknown scent.  Nothing.<br />
<br />
Nick grinned, seeing her suspicion. &quot;Don't you want to know how I knew you were hiding outside my door?&quot;  He asked.  &quot;Here, I'll show ya.&quot;  He turned the laptop screen to face her.  &quot;See that red dot?  That's you.  Or I should say that's your collar.  Did you know that you're wearing a very advanced piece of Crey Industries technology around your neck?&quot;  Cathy's eyes widened and she understood what that meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Nick laughed, seeing the surprise in her eyes.  &quot;It means I've got one of these too!&quot;  Out of his pocket he pulled a small remote; a remote that would render Cathy helpless with the press of a button.  A single, solitary thought screamed through her mind like a runaway locomotive: <i>'Aw crap.  I'm screwed.'</i><br />
