<br />
Cathy yawned and groggily turned on her side, pulling her legs up and curling into a more comfortable position.  Her bed was so comfortable that she started working herself deeper into the pillows.  It took a few seconds for her to realize that this wasn't her bed.  She opened her eyes and found herself staring at an antique Chippendale dresser of immaculate condition. She raised her head, sat up in the bed and surveyed the room.  It was as if she had been dropped into a bedroom at Buckingham Palace.<br />
<br />
She scratched her head, trying to remember what had happened, then her hand went down to the back of her neck where her fingers hit metal.  It wasn't the collar Cathy had worn for the majority of her adult life, the collar given to her by her best friend to help in a troubling time which she now wore as a symbol of who she is and to remind her of her friendship with Trish.  This felt like a solid metal collar to which Cathy could not find a release.<br />
<br />
The surreality of the situation reached its climax when a butler walked into the room carrying a plate of food on a silver serving tray.  &quot;Good afternoon milady&quot; he spoke up in a true english accent.  &quot;It's a pleasure to see you awake.  I brought you something to eat, as I would imagine you are quite famished.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was struggling with her memory, it seemed foggy and uncertain.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;  she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Simon.  I'm the butler.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy remembered back to the delivery boy, the roses, the tranquilizer dart.  <i>'Is this some kind of weird practical joke?'</i> she thought to herself.  She looked under the bedsheets and found she was still wearing her t-shirt and sweat pants.  &quot;I don't supposed you'd have a change of clothes for me?&quot; she asked, starting to formulate a plan in her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course milady.  The closet is over there&quot; he pointed &quot;If there is anything you can't find, don't hesitate to ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy slid out of bed, still confused and overwhelmed by the expensive furnishings.  Opening the walk-in closet she found it full with dresses of all styles, and all of them seemed to be about her size.  After closer inspection she noticed holes in the back of each dress, placed perfectly to accept her tail.  &quot;All of these will fit me?&quot; she called out to Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes milady.&quot;<br />
<br />
That disturbed Cathy greatly.  This was no joke, and judging by the clothes and the effort taken this was expected to be a long term stay. &quot;There are only dresses in here&quot; she called out.  &quot;Do you have anything more casual, like jeans and a shirt?&quot;  Though scanning through the closet she only found high heeled shoes and a couple pairs of slippers, she decided not to add casual footwear to the request as that might have given the butler a hint that she intended to bolt. Bare feet would have to do.<br />
<br />
Simon opened one of the drawers to the dresser and pulled out a pair of jeans, then opening another he pulled out a silk blouse.  &quot;Is this acceptable milady?&quot; he asked, handing Cathy the clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.  I'll change in the bathroom.&quot;  Cathy didn't move immediately, but there wasn't enough time for an awkward silence before Simon pointed to the bathroom door.  Cathy faked a courteous smile then entered the bathroom and turned on the lights, and with the first look into the mirror she couldn't help but gasp.  It was the collar around her neck.  It was a solid collar, but it was a beautifully intricate design, and its three rows of diamonds shone like novae in the light. The rows of diamonds were interrupted by a half-dozen dazzling red rubies spaced evenly around the collar, glowing like hot embers. She couldn't help but reach up and touch it, just to make sure it was real.  <i>'I must be wearing hundreds of thousands of dollars around my neck'</i> she thought.  Turning the collar around she could not find a latch - it almost appeared to be a solid ring of metal encrusted in jewels.<br />
<br />
She considered her few options and decided on one - bolt as quickly as possible and try to find help.  Simple but effective; they probably expected her curiosity to keep her here for the time being so they wouldn't be ready.  She'd start in one direction then turn north.  Hopefully they'd continue in the direction she started while she headed to safety.  <i>'Wherever 'safety' is'</i> she added, lowering her mood slightly.  She changed into the jeans and blouse, both fit her body perfectly,  then then folded up her sweatpants and shirt. She carried her clothes out to the bedroom and found that the butler had arranged a seating area for the food he had brought.  Cathy held out her clothes and asked &quot;Would you mind having these washed?&quot;<br />
<br />
The butler approached, and as he reached for the clothes they fell to the ground and Cathy sprung into action.  She grabbed him by the wrist and spun him around, yanking his arm up high behind his back then wrapping her other arm around his neck.  He grunted in pain but did not offer resistance.  &quot;Okay, now I'm getting out of here&quot; she stated in a low, even voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please milady, I'd advise against trying to leave&quot; he said, trying to remain composed but still in some pain from the pressure Cathy was applying to his arm. Cathy pushed Simon out of the bedroom door and into the hallway, her mind yelling at her to get out of the building as fast as possible.  Her neck started tingling, the hairs on the back of her neck started rising, and she scanned the hallway trying to guess where the exit might be.  &quot;Please milady, you must be feeling it by now.  I really must suggest you return to your bedroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I'm trying to do&quot; she countered. &quot;My bedroom is in Paragon City.&quot; She shoved the butler in the back to get him moving again, but after several steps her body shut down, as if turned off by a light switch.  The instant Cathy went limp the butler shot up his free hand and pulled Cathy onto his back, preventing her from crumpling to the ground.  He knelt down and slowly lowered her to the floor, making sure to cradle her head with as much care as possible.<br />
<br />
Cathy started to panic.  She had never experienced anything like this.  She was paralyzed from the neck down.  She started hyperventilating, struggling to get oxygen to her lungs.  Simon came into view, the panic in Cathy's eyes raged like fire.  &quot;It's okay, you're going to be okay&quot; he calmly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I can't move!&quot; she sputtered<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh... it's okay.  It's the collar.  Your movement will return when I get you back to your room, but I need you to calm down first.  Take a deep breath, please.&quot;  Cathy saw that the butler's sad eyes appeared to hold real concern for her,  and it crossed her mind that he may be a less than willing accomplice to her abduction.  Cathy struggled to control her breathing, helped by the butler's coaching. &quot;In... and out... in... and out&quot;. After a minute Cathy was breathing normally, though in her mind she had been swiftly defeated.  <i>'I'm not getting out of here while I have this thing around my neck'</i> she admitted to herself. The beautiful jewel encrusted collar had quickly become very ugly.<br />
<br />
Cathy looked up at Simon. &quot;Why am I here?&quot;<br />
<br />
With sad eyes Simon thought for a moment then replied to Cathy's question. &quot;I can't answer that milady.  I can tell you that Mr. Monroe would never do anything to hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He hurt me when he kidnapped me. He hurt me when he put this <i>thing</i> around my neck&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon looked at Cathy but said nothing; he had no way of disagreeing with her.  He picked her up and carried her back into her bedroom, laid Cathy on the bed, then fluffed up the pillows and carefully positioned them behind her head. After a moment Cathy spoke. &quot;You said I would be able to move again when I was brought back here, but I still can't.&quot;  She tried to state it as if it were an observation, but the concern in her voice shone through.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will take a few minutes for it to reset.  I know it's a terrifying experience - I imagine you don't understand why you cannot move your limbs. What it's doing is intercepting and suppressing your motor functions as they leave the brain, preventing your muscles from receiving any commands.  It's merely a way of keeping you here without causing you physical pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon moved from Cathy's side and she lost sight of him.  &quot;Simon?&quot; she called out, trying to move her eyes further than her vision would allow, fearing that she would be left alone and paralyzed in an unfamiliar place.<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies milady.&quot; He returned to her field of view, holding the platter of food.  &quot;I thought you might like something to eat or drink, to calm you. I promise you I will not leave until I know you have regained your movement.&quot; Cathy closed her eyes, realizing how vulnerable she was at the moment, unable to lift a finger to help herself.  <i>'I will not cry.  I am Nightprowl.  I will not cry.'</i>  It was well after the fact when she realized that her hands were balled up into fists - she had regained her movement.  &quot;I can move now.  Get out&quot; she stated to Simon in a cold, monotone voice.  Without a word he obliged.<br />
<br />
Cathy drew her knees up to her chest and wrapped her arms around them.  She gazed at the far wall, trying unsuccessfully not to think about the previous day, how she had turned a corner in her life and how she was ready to make Gerald an important part of it.  Now she was being held captive in an unfamiliar place and may never see him again.  Only Nightprowl was able to hold back Cathy's tears.<br />
<br />
<br />
***2***<br />
<br />
<br />
After a few minutes Cathy had taken stock of her situation.  She wasn't going to be hurt but she was a prisoner none the less.  She considered that she might be a 'trophy' of someone who had followed her heroics in Paragon City, or even someone who's criminal activities she had thwarted, but then she remembered five months ago when she was abducted by Samuel Roeper.<br />
<br />
<i>'I've found a very wealthy person who is particularly fond of cats'</i> he said to her. <i>'he just <b>must</b> have you. You've been <b>sold</b>, Cathy.'</i> he told her with glee.  It certainly fit.  It never sat well with her that they'd never identified Roeper's 'customer', but now it appeared that she would soon meet him in person.<br />
<br />
She slipped off the bed and cautiously approached the open door, leery of how the doorway had set off the collar around her neck.  She ran her hand along the door frame but couldn't find anything unusual.  Her room was at the end of a long hallway.  She peered down the hallway, noting the regal furnishings similar to the bedroom.  She poked her head out of the doorway and her neck began to tingle.  She pulled back and it stopped.  That was the warning, the tingle in her neck would tell her that she had to turn back.  She turned around and took a look at the room; her prison cell. Her cage.<br />
<br />
She picked at some of the food on the platter left by Simon, at first weary that it might be drugged but too hungry not to eat.  She began opening the dresser' drawers, finding shirts, blouses, pants, skirts, and undergarments, all appearing to be her size.  She searched through the vanity, finding a large selection of makeup and very expensive jewelry, including several watches.  She lifted out the tray containing the watches and examined them; all had the same time, down to the second.  She put one on, a ladies' Rolex, and resumed her search.  She went into the bathroom and rummaged through the drawers and medicine cabinet, finding the same types of products she had in her own bathroom.  <i>'Did they break into my apartment to see what kind of toothpaste I use?'</i><br />
<br />
It was then when she heard a noise in her room.  She looked out of the bathroom and saw a red rubber ball rolling to a stop.  Without warning it was pounced on by a little girl in a pink and white dress.  This wasn't any ordinary girl though; she was covered in fur and she had a tail. <i>'She's a mutant, like me'</i> Cathy thought to herself, though the little girl's mutation was much more advanced than Cathy's.  She looked like a missing link between feline and human.  She had pointed cat ears and large eyes, a cat's button nose, and her hands would be more accurately considered paws as they didn't appear to have opposable thumbs.  Cathy then saw the diamond and ruby encrusted collar around her neck, indicating the little girl was as much a prisoner as Cathy.  Cathy's escape plan had suddenly become twice as complicated; there was no way she was going to leave this precious little girl behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello&quot; Cathy said from the doorway of the bathroom, smiling and crouching down to appear less intimidating.  The little girl was still surprised and took an apprehensive step towards the door before looking back and stopping.  She began staring at Cathy.  After a couple seconds Cathy realized the little girl wasn't staring directly at her; she followed her gaze and found that she was staring at Cathy's tail.<br />
<br />
Cathy smiled again and answered her stare. &quot;Yes, I have a tail, just like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you my Mommy?&quot; she said, and it broke Cathy's heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sweetie, no, I'm not your Mommy.  My name's Cathy - what's yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madison.  That's a very pretty name.  Are there any more here like us?  With tails, and these&quot; she said, gently tugging on her collar.<br />
<br />
Madison nodded.  &quot;Wanna go see'em?&quot; she asked, and before Cathy could reply Madison lept out the doorway, looking back for a second, then leaping down the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madison, sweetie&quot; Cathy called out, but she was down the hall before Cathy could explain that she was unable to leave the room.  She went to the doorway and looked down the hall to see Madison looking back and disappearing into another room.  Cathy looked at her doorway and stepped through it; nothing.  No tingle on her neck warning her to get back in her room, no sudden loss of body movement.  She looked back into her room with suspicion. <i>'Was somebody watching me?  Was I supposed to stay here until I met Madison, then was free to roam the hallways?'</i>  She decided that she'd take a closer look at her room later, to make sure she wasn't being spied on.<br />
<br />
Cathy quickly lept to the doorway she'd seen Madison enter and was surprised to find a large room divided in half by a wall of bars.  Madison was at the bars, looking in.  &quot;They're outside&quot; she said, pointing to an opening on the opposite wall.  She approached a door built into the bars. It had a push button code lock but Madison seemed to know the combination, pressing 1-2-3-4 and pulling on the handle.  It opened with a click and Madison went in, letting the door close behind her.  She crossed the room without a second thought and disappeared through the opening.<br />
<br />
Cathy examined the door and the bars; even from the other side she'd be able to reach around and enter the code.  She pressed 1-2-3-4 and pulled on the handle.  It opened.  She entered the other half of the room, noting daylight peeking in from the small opening. <i>'Maybe this is our chance to escape'</i> she thought to herself.  She scanned both sides of the room, noting while there was furniture outside the cage, inside was more sparse, with a scattering of pillows and simple bedding, as if they were expected to sleep on a cushion on the floor.  There were bowls near the bars, further indicating that these mutants were being treated as animals, not people.  She then scanned the ceiling, looking for a camera, and found it mounted high up above the furniture outside the cage; she looked directly at it, wondering if anyone was watching and what they'd do if she tried to go through the opening in the wall.  <i>'Only one way to find out'</i> she ventured.<br />
<br />
Cathy stooped low and looked out the opening; there was a small passage about six feet long and sunlight was shining in from the outside.  After a couple steps into the passageway her collar went off, tingling its warning. &quot;Dammit&quot; she muttered; they'd even thought to trap this opening.  As she was preparing to back out of the passageway the light from the opening darkened; a large silhouette appeared and began loping towards her.  It had a massive head and was walking on all fours.  As it approached her brain clicked and she stumbled back with the realization that she was face to face with an african lion.  Cathy tripped on her heel and fell backwards, smacking her head on the floor.  She reached up and grabbed her head, wincing at the pain, but the lion was on top of her before she could do anything.  She laid there completely still, trying to ignore the throbbing pain and looking up at the lion straddling her body, his face only inches from hers.<br />
<br />
The lion looked down on Cathy and proceeded to offer her a big kiss, dragging his massive tongue repeatedly up Cathy's face until she was covered in slobber.  He then nuzzled his head to her arm as if demanding to be scratched.  Cathy laughed and was happy to oblige.  &quot;You're just a big kitty cat, aren't ya?&quot; she said, working her fingers under his collar and into his soft mane; her other hand scratched feverishly behind his ear, his eyes narrowed in pleasure, and he let out a deep purr.  &quot;What's your name?&quot; Cathy asked him, not expecting an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;His name's Zeus&quot; replied Madison, looking down at Cathy over the lion's left shoulder.  &quot;He likes you.  Magick's coming too.&quot;  Almost on Madison's words a bengal tiger appeared on the other side of Zeus.  Magick didn't appear too pleased that Zeus was receiving such affection from Cathy, but she seemed to tolerate it.  &quot;Sorry Magick&quot; Cathy said to the tiger, &quot;I guess Zeus is your guy, but he didn't give me much of a choice in the matter.&quot;  Cathy held out her hand towards Magick, letting her sniff Cathy's scent and know that she wasn't a threat.  Magick licked Cathy's hand once then nuzzled it, and with a quick scratch behind Magick's ear all was forgiven.  &quot;Zeus, do you think you could get off me now?&quot; Cathy asked, and Zeus seemed to understand; he backed off her and found a spot to lie down, and Magick followed suit, lying down next to him.<br />
<br />
Cathy sat up and brushed the lion hair from her thighs and turned to Madison. &quot;This isn't exactly what I meant by being 'like us', Madison&quot; she said.  &quot;Are there any more mutants here?&quot;  Madison seemed puzzled, like she didn't know what a mutant was.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you?&quot; Cathy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm five&quot; she said, staring over at the two big cats and rocking on her feet.  She seemed to be more interested in playing with Zeus and Magick than answering Cathy's questions.  Cathy saw this and decided her inquiries could wait. &quot;Okay, you can go play with them&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Madison smiled and darted for Zeus, barrelling into him and grabbing him, causing him to roll on his back and let out a roar.  Magick scurried out of the way and ended up finding a place beside Cathy, both of them watching Zeus and Madison roll around in a playfight.  Cathy was a bit taken aback at first, but quickly noted that Zeus was being the perfect gentleman, letting Madison get the upper hand and turning the tables to let her try something else.<br />
<br />
Cathy and Madison spent over two hours in Zeus and Magick's cage, and Cathy learned that Madison actually understood the two cats quite well.  Cathy herself seemed to have a strange sense of what the cats were trying to convey, almost like she could tell what they were feeling.  They seemed to be very happy with their home and were well taken care of. Both cats also cared very deeply for Madison, almost considering her a younger sister.<br />
<br />
<br />
***3***<br />
<br />
<br />
Shortly before six o'clock Simon came in the get them.  &quot;Ladies, it's time to get ready for dinner&quot; Simon spoke up from the other side of the bars.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be out in a second&quot; Cathy said to Simon then turned towards Madison &quot;Come on Madison&quot; she said, holding out her hand. &quot;let's go get something to eat.&quot;  Madison took her hand and they exited Zeus and Magick's cage.  Simon realized that Cathy thought that she would be having dinner with Madison.  &quot;You misunderstand milady.  I will be feeding Miss Madison; you will be dining with Mr. Monroe.  I've set out your clothes on your bed; when dinner is ready to be served I will escort you to the dining room&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to have dinner with Madison instead&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry milady, but Mr. Monroe requested that you dine with him, and that you wear appropriate dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather..&quot; Cathy began, but the collar around her neck started tingling.  She looked at Simon with surprise &quot;The collar - it's tingling.  I didn't do anything wrong this time&quot; she insisted, fearing that she'd drop to the ground within seconds.  Instead the tingling stopped.  Simon looked at his watch, and out of habit Cathy looked at hers; it was six o'clock on the nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was your automatic notice milady.  At six o'clock every night your collar will notify to you go to your room; you will have fifteen minutes to do so.  You will then have thirty minutes to dress for dinner, after which I will escort you to the dining room. You will dine at seven o'clock each night with Mr. Monroe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So in other words I have no choice in the matter&quot; Cathy replied sourly.  &quot;I guess it's back to my cage before this damn thing around my neck goes off.&quot;  Cathy turned to Madison and with as much happiness she could muster at that moment she knelt down to her and smiled. &quot;I had a fun time with you today Madison. Maybe we can see each other tomorrow, okay?&quot; Madison nodded and Cathy stroked her head and gave her a kiss on the cheek. &quot;Good night, sweetie&quot; she said, then turned and began the walk back to her room.<br />
<br />
Cathy walked down the hallway and entered her room, closing the door behind her.  A expensive black backless dress waited for her on her bed along with matching shoes.  She looked at the dress, picked it up, and held it to her as she looked in the full length mirror.  It was a beautiful dress which had Cathy seen at a store and price was no object, she probably would have bought it, but she knew it wasn't her choice, she was expected to wear it; ordered to wear it.  She tossed the dress on the bed and returned to the mirror, modelling the outfit she currently wore, a silk blouse and jeans, both dirty and covered in cat hair from her visit with Zeus and Magick.<br />
<br />
&quot;This'll do nicely&quot; she grinned, hoping her first impression on this 'Mr. Monroe' would be a lasting one.  She was still barefoot so she picked up the high heeled shoes on the bed and put them on.  <i>'I'm not completely without compromise'</i> she thought to herself.  She then began searching the room, looking for hidden cameras and listening devices.  She had a feeling, a gut instinct that she was being watched, but after searching for several minutes she couldn't find a thing.<br />
<br />
At six thirty there was a knock on the door.  &quot;Milady, are you decent?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was still searching for monitoring devices, but had no idea what she was looking for and had simply ended up frustrating herself, knowing that someone was watching her but unable to do anything about it.  She opened the door and with a fake smile said &quot;Yes Simon, I'm dressed.  What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon saw that she was still wearing her jeans and blouse.  &quot;Milady, you haven't dressed for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy replied innocently &quot;Yes, I'm going to wear this.  I did put on the shoes though; they're very beautiful, and surprisingly comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something wrong with the black dress milady? It was...&quot; Simon seemed to catch himself, then finished his sentence &quot;It should fit you perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it does, and it's very beautiful,&quot; Cathy responded &quot;but I like to dress more casually for dinner.  I'm sure Mr. Monroe won't mind.  He wants me to be myself, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, milady&quot; Simon answered then left the room.  Cathy heard the tone in his voice and knew when he broke the news to Mr. Monroe that their new prisoner was being difficult, Mr. Monroe wasn't going to be happy.  Cathy was delighted at the thought.  She approached the doorway and watched Simon walk down the hallway.  She looked at the door frame and poked her head out.  The collar began tingling. Cathy pulled her head back and slammed the door in a sudden fit of anger - she was still caged like an animal.<br />
<br />
<br />
***4***<br />
<br />
<br />
At quarter to seven Cathy heard another knock on the door.  &quot;Come in&quot; she said, and the door opened and Simon entered.  &quot;Are you sure I can't convince you to wear your black dress, or any of the dresses in the closet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure&quot; Cathy replied.  &quot;I would have worn my sweats and t-shirt, but you seemed to have taken them from me.&quot; she added.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're being cleaned milady; I can have them returned to you after dinner if you'd like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.  So, I guess I finally get to meet this Monroe guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Simon replied and began escorting Cathy down from her room and down the hall.  Cathy eyeballed the doorframe as they exited her room but the collar didn't respond to her leaving her room.  They were almost to the dining room when Cathy asked a question. &quot;What's his first name?  You haven't told me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Monroe's first name is Charles.&quot; Simon replied, and he led her into an extravagant dining room with a huge crystal chandelier under which was a long table.  A man in a suit and tie sat at one end of the table, and rose from his chair as Cathy entered the room.  He must've been around forty years old, and had the situation been different Cathy might have considered him moderately attractive.  His eyes were fixed on her and Cathy was a bit disappointed that he didn't seem to be upset with what she chose to wear.  In fact with the room and the furnishings and the two men in the room in suits and ties, Cathy herself was suddenly feeling decidedly under-dressed for the occasion.<br />
<br />
Simon led Cathy to her place at the opposite end of the table and pulled out her seat for her.  She looked down the table and noticed that Charles was waiting for her to sit down before he returned to his seat.  Cathy scanned the cutlery set out in front of her; there was a knife and fork, and even a steak knife.  <i>'They're giving me weapons'</i> she thought to herself.  <i>'They're either very stupid or very sure of themselves.'</i>  Cathy knew they weren't stupid.<br />
<br />
She picked up the steak knife and held it in front of her, looking at it then glancing down the table at Charles.  Now he seemed to be getting a bit nervous.  &quot;What prevents me from throwing this knife down the table and killing you?&quot; she asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.  I ask that you don't though; it won't get that collar off your neck, and the collar is what's keeping you here, not me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it's turned off right now&quot; Cathy replied. &quot;If I take out you and Simon, I could then leave here regardless of whether it's around my neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles responded by placing a small object on the table.  &quot;Your collar isn't turned off, it's simply programmed to allow you to go certain places at certain times.  If everyone here but you leaves this house you'll end up either confined to your room or on a floor somewhere unable to move.  This remote allows me to override the automatic programming, either by sending you to your room with a fifteen minute warning, or by stopping you immediately.  It won't turn the collar off though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy placed the knife back on the table. She began fidgeting, wondering what was expected of her.  After a several seconds of awkward silence Charles spoke up.  &quot;You decided not to wear the dress Simon laid out for you.  Did you not like it?&quot; he asked.  Cathy noted that there wasn't any animosity in his voice, he just seemed curious.  Cathy decided not to reply what she was thinking, <i>'I didn't wear it to spite you, because I knew you wanted me to wear it.'</i>  Instead she replied &quot;It looked very beautiful, but I like to dress casually for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't dress casually last night.  You looked very beautiful in that red dress you wore to dinner.&quot; Charles said<br />
<br />
Cathy was taken aback.  <i>'They were watching me last night?'</i>  She thought.  <i>'Oh my god, does he have Gerry?  Roeper abducted both of us; did this guy take Gerry from his hotel?'</i>  Her aura of confidence was eroding - she couldn't continue trying to be difficult for Charles without knowing exactly what he had on her.  This posturing of suits and dresses and expensive furnishings and butlers hid the fact that she was a prisoner here.  &quot;Where's Gerry?&quot; she calmly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about him,&quot; Charles answered &quot;I want to take care of you here.  I want you to be happy here.&quot;<br />
<br />
His response angered Cathy and she rose from her chair.  &quot;I'm going back to my cage.  I'm done playing house with you.&quot;  She began walking for the exit, confident that nothing he could say would get her to stop but worried about whether he'd use the remote to make her stop.  &quot;Please, return to your seat&quot; Charles said, watching her walk to the exit. &quot;Cy..Cathy, please sit down!&quot; he insisted, but she continued towards the exit.  There was one name he knew would stop her, and he said it. &quot;Trish Jackson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy paused at the doorway. She didn't want to look back, she wanted to continue to her room, her cage, carrying out the promise she'd just made, but the name froze her.  Trish had been her lifelong friend, always there for her.  She died as Northern Shock, a hero trying to defend Paragon City from the Rikti invasion.  When she died Cathy was crushed, and while fighting crime in Paragon City she had tried to uncover what happened to Trish and whether she really was dead.  Cathy turned and faced Charles.  Charles turned to Simon and motioned him to bring something to him; it was a large folder.  Charles looked at Cathy and spoke.  &quot;This is what you've always wanted to see.  This is the official report on the death of your friend along with her teammates.  I understand twice Mr. Simms petitioned to have you cleared to read this report, but both times it was refused.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was surprised; she never knew Gerald had tried to get permission for her to read the report.  &quot;Where's Gerry?&quot; she asked again, worried about whether Charles had him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would guess he's still in Paragon City.  I haven't done anything to him.  Do you want this folder?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy stared at the folder lying on the table in front of Charles.  She quietly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll have to earn this folder; I won't give it to you.  But what I ask is very simple.  I simply ask that you act like a lady, and in future you dress like a lady when we have dinner together. I don't think that's too high of a price to pay. If you disagree, then I will have Simon serve you your dinner in your room and you won't see this folder again.  If you agree, then please return to your seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy wanted so badly to turn away and walk to her room, but she knew she couldn't; she needed to read that report, and to do so she would have done much more than than what Charles was asking of her.  After a short pause she turned and slowly walked towards her seat.  Simon jogged over to hold her chair, and Charles rose from his seat slightly as Cathy sat down.  Cathy quietly ate dinner, avoiding looking down the table at Charles but occasionally finding herself staring at the folder still by his side.  After desert there was a moment Cathy found herself wondering what next was expected from her; she'd dined with Charles and acted as politely as she could.  Sucking up her dignity she spoke up.  &quot;May I be excused from the table?&quot;  She hadn't asked to leave a table since she was a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping that we could have an after dinner talk.  I want to answer any questions you might have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy's rage started boiling, she didn't think she could act like a 'lady' for much longer.  &quot;I'd rather not&quot; she stated coldly, but lightened up with her excuse. &quot;I've had an eventful day and would like to rest, if that's alright with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, you may be excused&quot; he said. &quot;It was a pleasure to dine with you tonight&quot; he added, though Cathy doubted the sincerity of the comment.  Charles rose from his chair but Cathy didn't move, she just looked at the folder on the other end of the table.  &quot;Oh, yes.&quot; he replied  &quot;Simon&quot; he called and Simon approached Charles, took the folder, then walked over to Cathy and handed it to her.  Cathy thanked Simon and rose from her seat, cradling the large folder.<br />
<br />
She began walking to the exit and couldn't help herself with a final, less than lady-like comment. &quot;I'll be in my cage if you need me.&quot; she said sternly, then left the room.  When she had returned to her room she found her sweatpants and t-shirt folded neatly on the top of the dresser.  Simon was true to his word.<br />
<br />
<br />
***5***<br />
<br />
<br />
Cathy read the file for the next few hours, trying to find any clue as to what could have happened to Trish.  She didn't even notice simon had entered the room until he cleared his throat.  &quot;Milady, is there anything you need for the night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked back at the doorway. &quot;My cage door has been locked I take it?  No leaving my room until morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon, I've got the feeling I'm being watched, but I haven't been able to find a camera.  While I understand the need to monitor me, I don't like the thought that someone may see me less than fully clothed.  If I was to get completely undressed, where would you suggest I do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon looked uneasily at Cathy, thinking about his response.  &quot;I would suggest you undress in your bathroom, or behind the folding privacy screen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.  I don't need anything else tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night milady&quot; Simon answered and left the room.<br />
<br />
<i>'Bathroom or privacy screen.  hmm.'</i> she thought, looking at the screen.  She began to approach the corner of the room opposite the privacy screen, thinking that it may have been placed there for a reason.  After several minutes of looking and passing over the same spot a few times, she finally found it. <i>'No, that couldn't be it'</i> she thought, looking at a tiny pinhole in the wall.   [i]'It is.  It's gotta be.'[i]  She went into the bathroom and squeezed out some toothpaste on her finger, then went back to the hole.  A smear of toothpaste and the hole was covered.  <i>'Well, I guess I'll find out soon if that's the camera.'</i> she thought, and went back to reading the file.  Less than ten minutes later Simon returned with some cleaning supplies and a sour look on his face, and without a word to Cathy he cleaned up the toothpaste then with a pin and cotton swap tried cleaning the hole as best he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;You misled me milady.  Please don't disturb the camera again.  Mr. Monroe is quite disappointed in you at the moment, and you should not cross him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did he say?&quot; Cathy asked, smiling at the thought that she was finally able to get under Charles' skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please milady, he will carry out his threats.  Please just leave it be.  You'll make both your night and my night much easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did he say, Simon?  What did he threaten to do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He... he said that if you think your room is a cage then he will put you in a <i>real</i> cage, which might give you a better appreciation for his hospitality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His hospitality?!  HE KIDNAPPED ME!&quot; Cathy yelled.  &quot;He can take his hospitality and shove it!&quot;  With that Cathy turned to the wall and threw a punch straight at the camera.  She smiled at the now fist-sized hole in the wall and the expensive sounding crack when she connected.  She turned around still smiling but was greeted with Simon's solemn face.  &quot;I wish you hadn't done that milady&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It felt good.  You can tell him the only hospitality I want is a trip home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon lowered his head and left, and Cathy felt she had just won a small victory.  She went back to reading Trish's file content with the fact she was no longer being watched.  It was 20 minutes later that she began to regret her actions, as a steel cage was rolled into her room on casters.  It was about 5 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 4 feet high, and appeared to be custom made, as it was intricately decorated with metalwork designed for beauty as well as functionality.  It also had a plaque with the name &quot;Magick&quot; engraved on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is that?  I'm not getting in that!&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Magick's travel cage.  You will spend the night inside it and I will watch over you to make sure you are okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!  I'm not getting in there.&quot;  she protested again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Milady, I told you exactly what Mr. Monroe had said, yet you still chose to disobey him.  You have only yourself to blame.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll apologize to him&quot; she said, hoping to talk her way out of her punishment and knowing she went too far this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry milady, but you will spend tonight in this cage.  That is a certainty.  I've put plenty of pillows and a couple blankets inside, so it should be relatively comfortable.  You should change for the night and use the bathroom before you enter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy sat on the bed for a while but this wasn't going to go away.  Cathy knew she had no choice, she had pushed her luck too far.  She could refuse, but with the collar around her neck she'd only be delaying the punishment, and the collar's ability to render her immobile concerned her more than spending the night in a confined space.  Simon had opened one of the drawers and pulled out a pair of silk pajamas, and was waiting for Cathy to accept them from him.  Cathy grabbed the pajamas and went into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.  She changed in the bathroom and readied herself to go to sleep, wondering if she'll be able to in Magick's cage with Simon watching.  <i>'They're just trying to break me; destroy my spirit.  It won't work.'</i>  She opened the bathroom door and knew it was time for her to accept the punishment for destroying the camera.  With as much dignity as she could muster she opened the cage door, stooped over and slid into the cage.  Simon closed the cage door and with a heavy click applied a padlock.  Cathy was locked in the cage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay in there?&quot; Simon asked<br />
<br />
Cathy considered her predicament, and decided on the optimistic approach. &quot;Yes, it's almost like a small bed.  Thank you for adding the pillows&quot; Cathy replied, feeling that Simon was trying to obey Charles' orders while making things as comfortable as possible for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Monroe spent the night in there once&quot; Simon offered.  &quot;Voluntarily, I mean.  Mr. Monroe didn't force her to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was a bit surprised &quot;There's a Mrs. Monroe?  Where is she and why would she spend a night in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She passed away five years ago.  She spent the night in the cage because she loved Zeus and Magick very much, and refused to put them through anything she wasn't willing to do herself.  She even designed the cages herself.  She spent one night inside each cage with Zeus and Magick watching, so they knew that when they had to travel in the cage, Mrs. Monroe had experienced the same thing.  She would have done anything for her cats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's very admirable&quot; Cathy replied, though she was wondering about the look Simon was giving her, as if he wasn't telling her the whole truth.  Cathy began wondering if she'd uncovered Charles' fixation with cats.  His dead wife loved them, and with her gone he decided to collect more in the form of mutants with feline properties.  <i>'Five years though, and 'only' two mutants.  And why not more animals instead of mutants?'</i>  She shook it from her thoughts; she was grasping at straws and knew she wouldn't be able to find out the real reason until she'd talked with Charles, understood why he took her. <i>'I should've talked with him after dinner, like he wanted.'</i><br />
<br />
A few minutes later Cathy was surprised to see Charles Monroe enter her room.  He appeared strangely sad at Cathy's situation; she thought that he would relish seeing her caged like an animal.  Without a word he walked over to the bed and picked up the file folder with all the information on Trish's disappearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's mine.  You gave it to me&quot; Cathy said.<br />
<br />
Charles looked at Cathy and with sad eyes he replied &quot;We had an agreement.  You agreed to act like a lady and I agreed to reward you with this.  You haven't lived up to your part of the agreement.&quot;  Charles began walking to the door and Cathy began to panic.  She knelt at the bars and wrapped her hands around them.  &quot;Please, no, don't take it&quot;  she reluctantly begged from inside the cage.  &quot;I'll be better, just don't take it.  I promise I'll behave.&quot;  Charles looked at the folder and looked at Cathy's pleading face.  As he turned and walked towards the door with the folder in his hand Cathy wanted to scream profanities at him but only a pitiful &quot;please&quot; came out.  When Charles got to the door he turned around.  &quot;You didn't earn this today.  You can earn this file with your actions tomorrow.&quot;  Cathy expected him to take the file, but he placed it on the dresser then exited the room. <i>'Thank you'</i> she thought, though unable to say it out loud.<br />
<br />
After Charles left, Simon began to set up for the night.  He brought in a chair and sat down, wrapping himself in a blanket and facing Cathy.  Cathy had already curled into a comfortable position but noticed Simon's actions.  &quot;Simon, why don't you just sleep in the bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn't be right milady.  I'm your butler.  I shouldn't be using your things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon, it's not like I'm using it tonight.  I don't mind.&quot;  Cathy noted the wording in his response and added another angle. &quot;You're <i>my</i> butler?  Then what if I <i>ordered</i> you to use my bed tonight?&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Simon smiled for the first time since they met.  &quot;Well milady, then I would have to do as you ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on then... I'm fine in here.  It actually reminds me of a stakeout I was on, only then I was wedged in a little alcove about 5 stories up, waiting for a meeting between two very bad people.  I was freezing cold and in a really bad mood by the time they showed up, so if I can voluntarily do that, this'll be a cakewalk.  These pillows are a lot more comfortable than a concrete ledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon slipped under the covers to Cathy's bed, and the room was quiet for a while, both trying to sleep.  &quot;Simon?  You still awake?&quot; Cathy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes milady.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to say I'm sorry.  Sometimes I do things without thinking them through. By destroying the camera after you told me not to I put you in a tough spot today, and for that I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No apology needed milady&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
Cathy decided to make her move, to see if Simon could be swayed into helping her. &quot;Simon?  Why are you letting him do this to me?  Help me escape, please.  Help me and Madison escape.  Madison and I have rights; we're mutants but we're human beings as well.  We don't deserve to be held against our will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Milady, there is much you don't understand about your situation, nor should you be expected to.  While I didn't agree with Mr. Monroe's decision to bring you here, it's much more complex than you realize.  Please, be patient and simply observe your surroundings for the next few days.  I pray that in that time all will become clear and you will understand why Mr. Monroe did what he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy huffed and curled away from Simon, feeling that she'd been given a brush-off. <i>'Just be a good little girl and wait'</i> she mocked. <i>'Yeah, right.'</i><br />
<br />
<br />
***6***<br />
<br />
<br />
Cathy awoke in the dark, though there was a sliver of light coming in from the bedroom door.  As her eyes cleared she scanned the room and found it twice as crowded as when she'd fallen asleep.  Madison was curled up in a ball, sleeping on the bed beside Simon, and in Simon's chair sat Charles Monroe.  Cathy looked at Charles, noticing that he was sleeping as well, his head tilted back and mouth gaping open.  She looked at her watch; she'd decided not to take it off for bed.  It was just after four in the morning.  Cathy shifted her weight and tried to stretch out, but the cage was slightly too small so she made due with stretching one leg at a time, then shifting down to stretch her back.  Charles began to stir, and Cathy immediately lied down on her stomach, pretending to sleep.<br />
<br />
Charles groaned and stretched, realized where he was then quieted down.  Cathy could feel him approach the bars, right by her head.  His hand ran softly through her hair but she kept still.  He seemed to move and Cathy lost track of him, not wanting to open her eyes in case he was staring at her.  She felt the blanket beside her move and start to slide over her; Charles was trying to cover her, but was doing a feeble job because of the cage.  Cathy grunted and stirred, turning on her side and making a half-hearted attempt at pulling up the covers in one motion, trying to appear that she was still asleep.  After a few quiet seconds Charles pulled the blanket the rest of the way over her.<br />
<br />
Cathy then heard Charles groan as if lifting something and heard Madison's tired voice. &quot;Where are we going?&quot; she wearily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh... We have to be quiet.&quot; Charles answered in a whisper. &quot;We can't be here when she wakes up.  I'm taking you back to your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I want to stay here with Mommy&quot; she whispered<br />
<br />
&quot;Madison, I told you you can't call her that yet, she's not ready. You have to call her Cathy for now.  Never call her 'Mommy' until I say that you can, okay?  Now blow Cathy a kiss and then I'll tuck you into your bed&quot;.   Cathy could imagine Madison blowing her a kiss goodnight, then heard Charles carry Madison out of the room, closing the door behind them.<br />
<br />
<i>'He's trying to create his own mutant family'</i> Cathy thought to herself. <i>'Is he a mutant too?'</i> she wondered.  Cathy realized he finally had an upper hand on Charles; she knew he wanted her to be the mother of his manufactured family, with Madison the daughter and him the father.  <i>'He's delusional.  Maybe he hasn't been right in the head since his wife died.'</i>  If she was patient and appeared to be playing his game he may begin to trust her more than he should.  But she didn't like that she may end up hurting Madison in the process <i>'As long as I'm able to take her when I escape I can live with that'</i> she reasoned to herself. <br />
<br />
Cathy tried to stay somewhat awake for the remainder of the morning but failed miserably.  She groggily awoke and looked at her watch; it was 9:27.  Simon was gone and the bed was made, and she was still in the cage. &quot;Oh man&quot; she said, thinking they were going to keep her there for a while longer.  She tried moving around to stretch again, and as she turned her feet hit the door to the cage and it swung open.  She almost laughed at her stupidity in not trying the door first.<br />
<br />
She crawled from the cage and stretched properly, then decided to approach her nemesis, the doorframe, and see if it would allow her to leave her room.  It did.  She walked down the hallway, still in her pajamas, and came to the dining room, figuring she might be able to get something to eat.  As she entered the room she noticed Charles sitting at the table, reading the newspaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, am I not supposed to be here?&quot; Cathy asked innocently, knowing that Charles was going to ask her to sit down.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please, sit down.  I'll get Simon to fix you breakfast.  Are scrambled eggs alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds wonderful&quot; Cathy replied <i>'Don't pour on the charm too much, or he'll know your playing with him'</i> she thought to herself.  &quot;I'd like to apologize to you for breaking your camera.  I shouldn't have done it but I was under some stress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I owe you an apology as well; I got angry and made you do something I shouldn't have.  I don't want us to be adversaries.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy wanted to say <i>'Then why did you abduct me you idiot!'</i>; it came out as &quot;Neither do I.  It was actually reasonably comfortable, although I wouldn't want to spend every night like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon brought out a plate of scrambled eggs, sausages, hash browns, a croissant, and a glass of orange juice and laid it in front of Cathy; she didn't realize how hungry she was until she started eating.  &quot;Ohhh, this is so good&quot; she said, making small talk.  &quot;So, what am I supposed to do today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I would have Simon show you around.  I'm sure Madison would like to spend some time with you as well - she really likes you.  While Simon is showing you around I'll have the hole in your bedroom repaired, and I'll have to have the camera replaced - I hope you understand that I'm just trying to make sure you don't do something you'd regret before you truly understand why you're here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'I know why I'm here.'</i> Cathy thought to herself.  <i>'I'm here because you're a disturbed individual who has enough money to do whatever you want.'</i>  Instead she asked &quot;Why can't you tell me the reason I'm here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be best if you discovered on your own.  Please be patient, and if all goes well you'll understand soon.&quot;  Charles folded up the paper and looked down the table at Cathy.  With a small pause and a concerned look he continued.  &quot;I know you don't understand why you're here right now, and it crushes me inside that I can't simply tell you, but I've been told that doing so may do more harm than good. You may seem like you're a prisoner here, and in your current state that may be true, but when you understand you'll find out that I'm only doing what's best for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'Act like a lady.  Act like a lady.'</i> Cathy recited the mantra in her head to avoid bursting into an angry tirade about how he was a delusional nutjob and she was here against her will.  &quot;I don't know what to say&quot; she responded.  &quot;Patience has never been a strong suit of mine, but I'll try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thankfully Charles left the table before Cathy had finished eating, allowing her to avoid asking to be excused from the table once again.  Simon cleared the table and began a tour of the mansion, or at least the wing of the mansion in which Cathy was permitted to freely roam.<br />
<br />
<br />
***7***<br />
<br />
<br />
Cathy was disappointed that she wasn't able to see Madison's room because it was in the other wing of the mansion, but shortly after Simon had finished the tour Madison's red rubber ball came bouncing down the hall with Madison bounding right behind it. &quot;Hi Sweetie&quot; Cathy said, stopping the ball with her foot and stepping out of the way to give Madison room to pounce.  Instead Madison eased up and when Cathy saw the look in her eye she knew Madison had chosen another target.  Madison pounced and Cathy held out her arms to catch her.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ophff.  You're such a big girl!&quot; Cathy exclaimed with a smile, twirling Madison around as she caught her.  Madison giggled and playfully stuck out her tongue, to which Cathy returned the favour then threw Madison up into the air. Madison squealed with delight and Cathy caught her then lowered her to the ground.  &quot;So kiddo, what do you want to do today?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Madison decided she wanted to play some board games, so she and Cathy spent the morning going through Candy Land, Checkers, Chutes and Ladders, and a couple less than ladylike games of Hungry Hungry Hippos.  Simon interrupted them shortly before noon, inquiring about lunch.  Cathy had a craving for a chicken and pineapple pizza while Madison wanted gummi bears, so they settled on a chicken and pineapple pizza sprinkled with gummi bears.<br />
<br />
After a few more games they decided to check in on Zeus and Magick, and offer them the pizza leftovers.  Cathy and Madison spent the next couple hours braiding Zeus' mane (to 'make him look pretty' Madison said).  Cathy was amazed that Zeus let them do it, and while Madison was chasing Magick around Cathy promised Zeus she'd remove the braids later that night after Madison had gone to sleep.  As they were braiding Cathy began asking Madison questions, trying to appear casual but trying to gain as much information as possible.  She learned that Madison was allowed almost free reign of the estate, indoors and outdoors with the exception of a few rooms on the opposite side of the mansion.  She had also never left the estate; she'd spent her entire life there and the number of visitors she'd seen could be counted on one hand, with none of them being children.  Madison said Simon was her uncle and Charles was 'Daddy'.  <i>'Building his own mutant family'</i> Cathy thought to herself again. She wondered how fully she could trust Madison with any escape plan; she'd never known any world but the mansion, and she did appear to be happy.  But Madison was collared, just like Cathy and just like Zeus and Magick.  To Charles they were lesser beings, animals, pets, and Cathy had already spent one night locked in a cage for crossing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie,&quot; Cathy said &quot;has Charles talked to you about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison looked at Cathy apprehensively.  &quot;I'm not supposed to say.  Daddy told me I wasn't allowed to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me what?&quot; Cathy asked.  &quot;Did he say that I was your mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison nodded.  Cathy saw the look in her eyes and couldn't bring herself to continue that path of the conversation, to tell her the truth, to tell Madison that she wasn't her mother and Charles wasn't her father.  Cathy stroked Zeus' back and looked at Madison. &quot;Doesn't Zeus look pretty now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison smiled and agreed.<br />
<br />
At six o'clock on the dot Cathy's collar tingled; she was to go back to her room and dress for dinner.  She kissed Madison on the cheek and said goodnight, then left for her room.  She passed Simon on the way out and gave him a nod; he gave her a short bow and went to get Madison.  Cathy entered her room and found the same dress as the night before laid out for her.  She looked over at the repaired wall, Cathy could barely make out where she had put the hole, and saw that in the top corner of the wall a camera had been discretely mounted.  <i>'At least he's not trying to hide it this time'</i> she thought to herself, not liking being watched but at least knowing what would and wouldn't be in the camera's line of sight.<br />
<br />
After showering she dressed for dinner and put on makeup, treating it as if she was going out on a night on the town.  At quarter to seven Simon came for her and after complimenting her on her appearance he escorted her to the dining room.  Charles' mouth gasped open slightly when Cathy entered the room, and for a moment Charles forgot his manners, then sprung to his feet as he remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look beautiful&quot; he said<br />
<br />
Cathy fought her urge to verbally joust with him, remembering her promise and Trish's folder.  &quot;Thank you&quot; she replied, taking her seat then setting her napkin on her lap.  They ate without much conversation, and after dessert Charles made a request.  &quot;Would you mind if I asked you to dance?  Just one dance?&quot;  Cathy didn't expect him to ask that; within an arm's reach of her was a very dangerous place for Charles, and regardless of the collar around her neck she knew that she could do some serious damage before it shut her down.  <i>'It's not the right time'</i> she thought to herself.  <i>'Lull him into a sense of security so that when the right time does come he won't know what happened.'</i> &quot;Yes, I'd love to dance&quot; she replied with a courteous smile.<br />
<br />
Charles took her hand and Cathy placed her other on his shoulder, closing her eyes and imagining Gerald standing before her.  Imagining Gerald putting his hand on her waist.  The music started and they began a slow waltz, with Cathy miles away.  She was dancing with Gerald in a ballroom in Paragon City.  She could imagine him biting his lower lip and looking down at his toes for fear of making a misstep, and the apprehensive smile he always gave when his effort wasn't quite equalling his expectations.  Cathy's lips rose into a light smile at the thought, and as Charles looked at her he melted in its radiance.  For minutes the two were in different places, circling the dance floor.  The music ended and the pair stopped dancing, and reluctantly Cathy opened her eyes, hoping to find herself in a ballroom in Paragon City but knowing that wasn't going to happen.  Her smile disappeared as Gerald was nowhere to be found, and Paragon City was still miles away.  Charles was standing in front of her, his eyes looking deeply into hers.  &quot;That was wonderful, Cynthia.  Would you mind if we had one more dance?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy.  My name's Cathy&quot; she flatly responded, realizing that during the waltz Charles was as much in his own dream world as she.  He stared at her for a moment, trying to grasp what she had just said, not understanding it.  He took his hand from her and removed the other from her hip, then stepped back.  His arms hung limply at his sides as he uncertainly replied &quot;Yes, I knew that.  I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles quickly broke eye contact and lowered his head, hurriedly leaving without another word and leaving Cathy standing alone in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
***8***<br />
<br />
<br />
The next morning Cathy ate breakfast alone in the dining room, then went back to her room to read.  A few hours later she began wondering about Madison so she decided to look for her.  After checking all the rooms, and checking in with Zeus and Magick, Madison was nowhere to be found and  Cathy began to worry, realizing she hadn't seen anybody since Simon served her breakfast.  She went back to her room and did the only thing she could think of that would draw attention; she covered the camera with a towel and waited.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes passed, then fifteen.  Cathy began to pace back and forth, wondering if something had happened and she had been left alone.  Twenty minutes later Simon finally showed up.  &quot;Where the hell were you?!&quot; Cathy exclaimed as he entered her room.<br />
<br />
Simon was taken aback with Cathy's aggressiveness &quot;I'm sorry milady.  I was attending to Mr. Monroe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Madison?  She hasn't been around all morning.  Is she alright?  I want to see her&quot; she demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Madison is spending the day outside with Mr. Monroe and a guest.  I'm afraid she will be busy for most of the day.&quot; replied, reaching up and removing the towel draped over the camera.<br />
<br />
<i>'And of course I couldn't be trusted to behave around someone who doesn't know that I'm a prisoner here'</i> Cathy thought to herself.  &quot;When will I be allowed outside?&quot;  she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully soon, milady.  It depends how your stay here goes&quot; he replied.  Simon thought for a moment, then asked Cathy a question.  &quot;Milady, may I ask why you're so concerned about Madison?  You seem very fond of her yet you've only known her for a short period of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'Leave Madison out of this'</i> Cathy thought; she didn't know what she'd do if they tried to use Madison as a pawn to get her to do what she was told.  &quot;She's an okay little kid&quot; Cathy replied nonchalantly, downplaying the connection she felt with her.  Simon gave an uncharacteristic chuckle and glibly added &quot;Miss Madison also does that with her tail when she's fibbing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy's blue eyes narrowed and turned to ice.  He now knew she cared for Madison, so there was only one option left to keep Madison from being a pawn in Cathy's confinement: fear.  Her stare bored into Simon and while gritting her teeth she opening threatened him in an unnaturally low, throaty grumble.  &quot;I will only say this once.  If you or Charles ever use Madison to get to me, there isn't a place on earth either of you will be able to hide from my wrath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy's verbal attack drew blood and Simon gulped hard.  &quot;I'm sorry milady, I truly am.  I never meant to... well, I just mean she really likes you and she's never known anyone really like her... like you.  You two seem to have a special connection, that's all I meant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy's eyes softened with Simon's hurried explanation and stammering reply.  &quot;I misunderstood the intention of your comment. Yes, I do feel something between us.&quot; She paused a moment and Cathy's eyes hardened just slightly enough for Simon to know that she was serious &quot;...but my threat still stands.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***9***<br />
<br />
<br />
For that night's dinner Cathy wore the clothes that Simon laid out for her, a stunning aqua dress with a plunging neckline and flowing lines, and accompanying high heeled shoes.  She entered the dining room and was surprised to see Madison sitting beside Charles, dressed up for dinner.  &quot;I thought it would be nice if all three of us dined together tonight&quot; Charles announced, smiling at Cathy and rubbing the top of Madison's head.<br />
<br />
Cathy thought it was bad enough that she had to act like a demure lady in front of Charles alone, but to do so in front of Madison would be much more difficult. &quot;That sounds wonderful&quot; Cathy politely replied, taking her seat at the opposite end of the table.<br />
<br />
Cathy laid her napkin on her lap and fiddled with her cutlery, trying to avoid any sort of pre-meal conversation.  Simon entered the room with the food, placing a plate in front of Cathy then walking the length of the table to place a plate in front of Charles.  He then placed a bowl in front of Madison.  Charles began cutting his meat and Cathy watched in disbelief as Madison leaned into her food like an animal, chomping at the food in the bowl.  Charles looked at Madison and smiled; Cathy could imagine him thinking <i>'Good little Madison - eat up, my pet.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I can't do this.&quot; she quietly said, lifting the napkin from her lap and throwing it on her food.  She rose up from the chair and her emotions surged through her brain like wildfire as she walked towards the door.  &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Charles asked.<br />
<br />
Cathy stopped and turned to address Charles.  &quot;You have been able to mold and alter my behaviour through coercion, bribery, and the love I have for my friend, but it goes no further.  I won't allow you to slowly turn me into your pet, sitting politely by your side, waiting for a pat on the head and a bowl of food for dinner. I can't play this game any more.  I won't play this game any more. I am a person, I'm not your pet!&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles looked stunned  &quot;I didn't realize you felt that way.  I want you to be my equal and nothing less.&quot;  He looked over to Madison, realizing this was the first time Cathy had seen Madison eat a proper meal.  &quot;Madison's eating the same food as we are, but because of her teeth and her hands she finds it difficult to use a knife and fork and chew her food, so Simon cuts it up for her.  I just wanted us to have a nice dinner, as a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not a family! I was brought here against my will!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cynthia, please sit down&quot; Charles said, catching his mistake as it left his mouth.<br />
<br />
Cathy glared at him. &quot;I am NOT Cynthia, my name is Cathy.  Cathy Watts.  That's the second time you've called me that - Cynthia was your wife, wasn't she?  Cynthia is dead - Simon told me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles looked at Simon. &quot;I have to tell her&quot; he said, but Simon countered. &quot;Sir, you know what the doctor said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to tell her about Cynthia.  I can't do this any more; it hurts too much&quot; Charles said, becoming emotional.  He looked at Cathy, and with tears in his eyes he began to explain.  &quot;Cynthia was my wife.   She died five years ago while giving birth to Madison and my life fell apart.&quot;  <i>'LAIR!'</i> Cathy shouted in her mind <i>'Madison can't be your daughter - nobody would treat their daughter the way you treat her.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I tried to continue on and run my company, but it was just too hard.  I couldn't stop thinking about her, mourning her.  Less than a year after her death I gave up operating control of my businesses and came here to raise Madison.  Six months ago I was contacted by a former 'business associate', a less than upstanding individual who I was forced to pay off to get a critical project completed.  He contacted me saying that he saw that someone who looked like my wife was being auctioned off and wondered whether I knew about it, or if it was her and I was responsible for the auction; he didn't know that she'd been dead for four and a half years.<br />
<br />
The woman who was being auctioned off was you, Cathy.  When I saw your picture I couldn't believe my eyes.  It was like you were Cynthia's twin, except you had a tail.  I couldn't let them do that to you; you reminded me too much of my Cynthia.  I knew that if I simply went to the police these men would disappear and never be caught, so instead I bid on you, I made sure that I won.  You were to be taken to my yacht where you would be set free and I hoped that with the descriptions of your abductors along with the money transfers I had made we would be able to catch these criminals.  But you escaped and caught them yourself, as Nightprowl.  I was so happy that you'd escaped, and that you had caught those people.<br />
<br />
That was also when my dreams started.  I began dreaming of Cynthia again, I needed to see her, but she was long dead.  Instead I started monitoring you; I used you as a way to appease my need to see her. I hired someone to follow you, take pictures of you, then send them to me.  I was seeing Cynthia once again, even if I couldn't be with her - I was obsessed with you.  About a month ago I was contacted by an employee of Crey Industries.  They noticed someone taking pictures of you and they did some digging of their own.  I wasn't prepared for what they told me.  <br />
<br />
They admitted that five years ago shortly after her death they took Cynthia's body; another body was cremated in her place.  They were doing studies about how mutants were born and how a seemingly normal man and woman could have a baby with such an advanced mutation as what Madison has.  They found that Cynthia and I had the mutant gene, but it was dormant in both of us.  Through their experimentation they re-animated her body and found that they had awoken Cynthia's mutant gene in the process.  She began changing, growing a long catlike tail and becoming extremely agile...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don't believe you&quot; Cathy replied, realizing what he was trying to explain.<br />
<br />
Charles continued with more emotion in his voice, seeing that Cathy was beginning to understand.  &quot;...but she still had her memories.  She was confused, very combative, and uncooperative with the Crey researchers so they purged her memories and created new ones.  New ones so intricate, so believable that she thought she was a normal person who had lived a full life.  They set up a home and business in her name and began a long term experiment, monitoring her life from a distance to see what would happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're lying&quot; Cathy answered, though her voice shook with uncertainty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I demanded that she be put back to her normal self, given back her real memories, but they said it had been too long; they didn't have the ability to do that.  They helped me bring her here in hopes that over time she would remember who she was and would regain her old memories naturally.  <i>You</i> are Cynthia Monroe.  You are my wife.  Madison is our daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe you&quot; Cathy repeated, but the doubt pounded her mind like a sledgehammer.  &quot;I'm Cathy Watts. I'm me!  I remember my childhood, I remember growing up!  My life is real!&quot;  She looked at Madison and her heart ached; she felt such a connection, a connection she thought was because they were both mutants. A connection that might instead be based on a subconscious maternal instinct, one that the Crey scientists couldn't erase no matter how hard they tried.  Cathy was so confused, the life she knew had just been tossed in the air and scattered to the wind.<br />
<br />
Madison looked up at Charles, who was still crying.  &quot;Are you okay Daddy?&quot; she asked innocently. Charles smiled and nodded.  Madison slipped under the table and lept into Cathy's arms. She hugged her with all her might and Cathy couldn't help but return the embrace. &quot;I love you Mommy&quot; she said with tears in her eyes.<br />

    <div align="left" id="post_message_226397">Comments are fine; as I reread it over and over while tweaking it, it became hard to tell how predictable it was, but when I changed from the billionaire being a standard 'megalomaniacal bad guy' to just a normal person driven to fix his broken family by any means necessary, I figured I'd error on the side of the reader being sympathetic to Charles and Simon's actions, and the reader telling Cathy &quot;Quit being so dense!  I know why you're there, so why don't you?!&quot;.  Maybe she did consider it, but really didn't want to believe it, and still doesn't want to believe it.  It's going to take some convincing on Charles' part, as for now Cathy's only reason for thinking Charles might be telling the truth is her attachment to Madison.  But that's for the next episode.<br />
<br />
The events in this episode have repercussions over the next two episodes (and longer), so I figured to just get the setting and character motivation down and Cathy's decisions will have to come in the next episode.  There's Charles, Gerald, and Madison all to think about, and Cathy will find out what happened to Trish (the only person that has spanned the gap between Cynthia and Cathy), and if she finds out who Trish really was she'll find out who she really is.<br />
<br />
This'll happen over the next two episodes, so there are still plenty of things mulling around in my head.</div>
