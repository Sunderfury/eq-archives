		<title>Rogues vs. Hunters in Battlegrounds?</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Hey all. After playing a Shaman on a PVE server just about forever, I finally made the switch to a rogue on a PVP server (For the Horde!). Upon reaching 
L19, I gleefully made my way to Warsong Gulch, where I proceeded to Get Some. Unfortunately, the puny Alliance seems to have lots and lots of Hunters, and they keep ruining my day.

Every time I attack one, I end up getting torn up from behind by the obligatory pet. They mark me, wing clip me, shoot me with concussive shot, and generally do all manner of unpleasant things to my poor, sneaky butt. I can hang with just about any other class, and I've even held my own against multiple rogues, but one hunter and his bear/lion/kitten is just too much. Even worse it is, when two hunters come after me. Remember, it's still low level (the 10-19 bracket), but I'd like to run the Gulch one more weekend. Anyone got some love for me?

P.S.-Great Forum, glad to be here!]]></description>

		<title>Help with PvP</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Long time member as an EQ1 rogue.  I've been playing WoW for a year or so. I became addicted to PvP with my hunter.  Although I like that class I've always missed being a rogue, so I've been playing my little rogue more and my big hunter less.

Recently I've been playing Tsalikr in the lvl29 battlegrounds and doing quite well.  However, I just leveled (like an idiot) and now I need some help deciding where to go with my additional talents.

1)  What does the most damage in PvP, maces, swords or daggers?  I've read that people will give up the backstab/ambush skills to duel-wield swords or maces.  Is it worth it to give up those skills in the 30-39 arena? How about later in the game?

2) What essential skills do you need?  Currently I have some things that, while they help me with pve and with my dag/backstab build, I wouldn't think they would be necessary for certain builds.   I have improved gouge 3, camouflage 5, improved backstab 3 and opportunity 2.  Obviously if I get away from the dagger/backstab build, these won't be used.  What should I use in it's place if I do change?

3) What type of items will help in pvp?  I am a blacksmith, but I have other charaters who are alchemists, tailors and leatherworkers.  I also have an enchanter and engineer, but it's hard to use engineering between characters.  I've already made a spider belt and green-whelp armor.  Are these useful?

Thanks in advance for the help

I have Barman Shanker with weapon chain in main hand, and Julie's dagger in offhand. Just not entirely sure what enchant to get for it. Money is not a problem, so any of the enchants are possible. Anyone got any firm opinions/previous experience about this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok a buddy of mine and his wife are playing this game.  He wants me to join him.  After seeing I cant get anything near a shadowknight / dark knight, I have went to my backup character of a rogue.

Let me state that this is on a PVP server and the have went with the alliance, im irritated cause I cant even be a troll.  I have instead decided to play a gnome.

Now my buddy is playing a human paladin, his wife is playing a gnome mage.  My use will be to teh group as a combat fighter, however pvp as i get higher in levles would be nice from what he is indicating to me.

My question is how do I build up the character to be a decent combat fighter with a switch to pvp.  I know I will be sacrificing some aspects of both ideas for balance.  

If anybody has any thoughts on this please let me know, also if you coudl differentiate between a dagger and a sword setup it would be much appreciated.

Now for my decision to play a gnome is based on the want to go after the engineering profession.  I have read about the two different schools of goblin and gnome.  If you can choose between both I will problay pick goblin cause the bombs interest me.  Does anybody have any thoughts on this.

Last thing, I am playing this for fun, I wont make 50 or 60 or whatever and wotn care about high end raids.  I wanna play with my friends and chill and enjoy it.  I already have to many real jobs, this isnt EQ.

		<title>Combat Vs. CB/Prep build (pvp question)</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I am currently working my way towards the 21/5/25 stun lock build and am lvl 40. I have cold blood and am now working down the sub tree for prep. While I enjoy this build I feel that I am limiting my DPS. I rarely loose in 1v1 pvp and do pretty well at 1v2/3 if I can get a jump and sap. I want to maximize my DPS to help in instances ect., but not lose my sheer dominance in pvp. 

I switched to a combat build briefly around 37ish and fell in love with blade furry. I didnt spec all the way to speciallized swords because I didnt have the points. My dps shined in SM and RFD becuase we were taking on multiple mobs and it was unreal. Unfortunatly, I didnt get much of an opertunity to PVP before I changed back. I didnt notice a difference when solo grinding when I switched from my CB/Prep build to combat, but I noticed a drop in efficiency when I switched back if that makes any sense. 

So basicly, I miss combat, but don't want to sacrifice my pvp abilities. Is there a drop off in ability of a combat sword spec rogue in 1v1 pvp? Any suggestions would be greatly appriciated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After having used the basic Cheap Shot / Cold Blood &amp;amp; Preparation build I changed to Ambush / BS recently and  now even specced the Subtlety tree 
down to Premeditation . Although Pre Med isn't very user friendly it does give me alot of 2/3 shot kills 
on soft targets . Problem with Pre Med /Ambush is that unless you use Kidney right after it will give 
enemies a small window to react . So I figured I'd get Improved Kick . The build sacrifices all the timer reductions and even Improved Evis . Another big sacrifice is Lethality Imo.  I improved stealth cause I'm horde and human rogues have too much of an edge . So if anyone feels like giving some comments please do .

		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[So this honor system is only doing one thing:  making it impossible for people (in particular, me) to even get to level cap. I'm 47 right now and I get maybe two mob kills then I'm swamped by Alliance and I have to travel the map to get back to my body. I can't go anywhere; people are freaking nuts for these honor kills. I hope the battlegrounds do something to get these jerks off the zones or I'm done with this game. 

I'm on a pvp server because I like to fight other players and raids are so much fun but I don't plan on going around with a group of 60s and kill players 20 levels lower. It's just bully-ing. They should get dishonorable kills and there should be some penalty for doing that.

		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I have been gone a while, and just started playing again recently.

Anyhow, last night I was in Desolace with 2 friends (3rd on her way) and we were doing some quests. As we were finishing the last quest, a 44ish rogue jumped us. warrior is 36 and I am 35. We also had a druid which was 45. Anyhow, we obviously took him down quickly.

Just after he released to begin his walk back our other friend showed up, a human priest. A plan formed in my mind in that instant, and I knew that this rogue would not disappoint me in their lack of ability. 

'Everyone shadowmeld' I said quickly, and the priest asked what was going on. I tried to quickly explain that a rogue had just jumped us and I wanted to kill him again. 'He will never attack me, nobody is that stupid' she said. I chuckled. &quot;Just sit down and start drinking some water.&quot; I said. She was full mana, but that hardly matters. We had all scattered around her and began to hide/meld. The rogue's corpse vanished as he came back to life.

&quot;See, he isn't going to come&quot; said the warrior. &quot;Never underestimate the idiocy of a badly played rogue&quot; I replied. 2 seconds later, the priest is stunned. 4 seconds later, the rogue is dead again.

It wouldn't have been quite so bad, except we are all in the same guild. I am sure nobody from here would ever fall for such an obvious ambush, so I thought I would share it with you for grins.

		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Last night I was in Lake (somethingortheother) in a contested area. Being level 37 I basically sneaking around killing....no killing isn't the right word. I was ganking lots and lots of level 15-30s alliance in that town by the lake.

I gotta tell you. This was my first time doing such a thing and it really was fun. Is it wrong to do such a thing? I don't think I killed anyone more than once, but I did it without worry or harm to myself. After doing all this I got no dishoner and even grouped a level 22 rogue with me to sit around and collect the honor from my kills.

I'm a firm believer that there should be dishonor. I guess I'm torn between making a political message that there should be dishonor and having fun sneaking around and being all roguely. 

It finally took a level 60 hunter to show up and track me down before I knew my fun was over.

This shouldn't have to be the state of PVP. I'm not proud of what I did all though it was really really fun. What are you thoughts of the current state of PVP?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am on Eonar server, its a PvE server and with this new patch my guild raided crossroads.  That was my first PvP action besides a few duels.  I had a ball.  What really hurt me was Fear but I knew that was going to happen based on all the forums I read.  But also those area effect fire spells are a pain. 

What I was wondering if resist gear is worth getting.  I was going to start with the +5 to all resits to my cloak.  Maybe pick up a ring or 2 just to use during raids like this.

I figured you pvp server people would know better if this is a waste of gold or not.

		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Hiyas - been reading alot, trying to sift through lots of post on here, but thought best to ask in the end!

I have played EQ for years, played afew other games too but never gone into PVP.  Myself, (the rogue), husband(warrior) and other friends(druid and priest,) are totally hooked on WoW now.  The 4 of us gave PVP a go the other night - just dueling amongst ourselves.  Had a riot, was great fun.  My question is this :- what is the best advice you can give a rogue who has no PvP exp.  I have just hit 30.  Got my poison skill up to 102, so have 3 poisons open to me atm.  I have taken up alchemy so I can brew agil, str, defense and magic resist potions (skill 161)  My talents have gone alot into the stealth line, very few in assassination, a little in combat.(Just how I see the &quot;character&quot; of my rogue being, not built for a particular play style.)

So for a beginner at PvP, what is the best single piece of advice you can give?  Thanks in adavance,
