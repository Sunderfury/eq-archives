		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, I'm still too low to get the quest, but thought it would be worth getting a thread started on the new lvl 50 Rogue quest at the manor mentioned in the patch notes.  

Ideas, spoilers, walkthroughs?  Sounds fun, just need to grind out the 23 more levels to start it...]]></description>

		<title>Instances: nice places to visit, team 58+ ?</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Ok we duoed most of Maraudon (rogue 58 and pally 59) and took good loot, but real fun are the tuffer instances to be done in chosen groups of 5.

So far we finished Sunken Temple of Atal'Hakkar (nice dragons),
went halfway the BRD (not much loot there), but have not seem much else.

What are nice places to visit for rogue/paladin/mage/hunter/priest at their 58+ levels? Where are nice drops &amp;amp; encounters?

Dire Maul, Stratholme, Spire?

Where to search for Paladin armor and rogue end-weapons?

cheers thx]]></description>

		<title>Weapons Quests</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I recently started playing WoW (about 2 weeks back).  I am a Night Elf Rogue and I am 1/3 a level from level 30.  Currently I am using a Blackfang (dagger) and Cruel Barb (1 hand sword) as my weapons.  


I have gone to the AH and looked for weapons upgrades but unless I want to spend in excess of 30 gold I can't find an upgrade that is better for my level.  

My question is are there certain Quests or Instances that should just not be over looked as a rogue? 

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give.

For the third quest in the &quot;Bloodsail Buccaneers&quot; quest line you need to bring the quest giver Bloodsail Charts and Bloodsail Orders. I found the charts but have searched for an hour and a half for the orders. Is this quest bugged or am I just an idiot?]]></description>

		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I just turned level 40. I have saved enough to get my horse but I have no money and my gear is on the very weak side. Anyone have some tips for making some money or any quest I could work on for gear. Am using 2 deadly kris of the monkey at the moment. I think my weapons need upgraded first then the rest of my gear. Any tips at all would be great.  I am pretty new to wow this is my first character. I am a human rogue btw and I have leatherworking/skinning as profession. On a side note, should I drop my leatherworking, atm is seems a waste can buy stuff that is much better it seems, and none of the items I can make sell.  I just made my first voodoo mask not sure what skill level that is, I am away from home for a week or so. OK enough rambling...

		<title>Garona: A Study on Stealth and Treachery (Dire Maul book)</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Hi all!

This is my first time posting in this sub-forum, although I'm a long time lurker in &quot;logged out.&quot;  I play a 60 Rogue on Archimonde, Horde, in the guild Nurfed.

Last night a few of us went to Dire Maul, East wing, and there by the last boss (I forget his name, Azzasomething) sitting on the floor was a book: 

Garona: A Study on Stealth and Treachery

The book starts a rogue quest, min level 54.

Quest: Garona: A Study on Stealth and Treachery
Objective: Return the book to its rightful owners.
Game Description: The tome carries the mark of Athenaeum.

This is the only info given you.  There is a mob named Garona listed in Hillsbrad, Ravenholdt, on Allakhazam's but it seems noone has had any luck finding him (I spent quite a bit of time last night looking too.)

I assume this is for the rogue trinket from Dire Maul, so I'm really excited to work on this quest!

Does anyone know what the next step is?  Someone mentioned something about &quot;turning in the book&quot; somewhere in West Maul - is that necessary?  Anyone else try this quest?  I should be going to West Maul today, so I'll update if I find anything.  I've seen various pieces of loot from DM, but I don't know if this quest has been completed (at least I haven't seen the reward.)

Thanks, and good luck!
