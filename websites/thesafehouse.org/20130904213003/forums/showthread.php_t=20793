Frozen Rage surveyed the battle in the entryway to the research complex, subduing opponents and keeping an eye on his teammates' backs.  As he was covering Boxcar he noticed Nightprowl look away, then suddenly bolt down the hallway. &quot;Night! Where the hell are you going? Get your ass back here!&quot; he called out while ducking a hail of bullets and freezing an attacker in a block of ice. Nightprowl didn't answer, but from his position he saw someone disappear around a corner at the end of the hall with Nightprowl in hot pursuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;She never listens to me&quot; he said to himself, shaking his head. &quot;You never leave your group in the middle of a fight.  That's a cardinal rule.&quot;  He called out to Boxcar. &quot;Boxcar, it's just me and you now - Night went AWOL.&quot;  Boxcar and Rage made short work of the rest of the security force &quot;This was supposed to be the very reason why we were here&quot; Frozen Rage remarked.  &quot;So she wouldn't go running off on her own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Boxcar just shrugged.  &quot;Well, it's only been about a minute since she took off...  I mean how much trouble could she get into in a minute?&quot; The look Rage gave him told him the answer.  &quot;Oh, that much, eh?  We'd better go find her then.&quot;   They hurried down the hallway and when they turned the corner they found a huge security door blocking their path.  &quot;See?&quot; Frozen Rage plainly said, knowing Nightprowl was on the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
Boxcar walked up to the door and gave it a soft rap with his fist; the sound it made told him the door was very solid and built to withstand more than he could dish out.  &quot;I can't punch through this&quot; he stated, but he noticed a security panel beside the door.  &quot;I've got an idea though&quot; he added, then reared back and delivered a powerful energy-charged fist to the security panel.  His fist went into the panel up to his metallic wrist and sparks shot from the opening.  He pulled his hand out and looked at the door.  A moment passed and nothing happened.  &quot;Open Sesame?&quot; Boxcar said to the door.  Nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Frozen Rage asked, shaking his head at Boxcar's attempt to open the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.  It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.  Destroy the panel and the door slides open.  It always works on TV.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage cringed at the thought that Boxcar was basing his combat decisions based on TV shows.  &quot;You know that TV isn't real, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez, I said I was sorry.  Jen just told me she can still hook up with the panel.  Just give me a sec&quot;<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage nodded then key his comm. &quot;Night?  Nightprowl?  Cathy, are you there?&quot; There was only static on the other end; their comm systems were being jammed.<br />
<br />
While he was hooking into the broken panel Boxcar talked to Jen, his General User Interface AI, through their internal link.<i>'Why didn't you stop me, Jen?'</i> he asked.  <i>'You made me look like an idiot.'</i><br />
<br />
<i>'Sorry'</i> she replied.  <i>'I needed the panel open anyway, and who knows - it might've worked.'<br />
<br />
'You really think it might've worked?'<br />
<br />
'No, not really.  I was just being supportive.'<br />
<br />
'Thanks Jen'</i> he said with a touch of sarcasm. Aloud to Frozen Rage he said &quot;Jen said she needed the panel open so she could access the facility's security system, so no harm, no foul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, while you hook up to security, I'll check out the rest of the floor.  Maybe there's another way down.&quot;  Rage spent the next several minutes checking out the rest of the floor, finding nobody else and no other way down.  He began to have a bad feeling in his gut that this whole thing was a big setup.<br />
<br />
<br />
***2***<br />
<br />
<br />
Nightprowl watched the figure in the doorway reach out to the side to turn on a light switch, and the florescent lights flickered and caught.  &quot;I know it's okay for you, but it's too dark for me&quot; the figure said.  She looked like Trish, and the sound and tempo of her voice told her it was Trish, but Cathy knew it couldn't be her; she was holding Trish's lifeless hand in hers.<br />
<br />
The Trish at the doorway noticed the wound in Cathy's abdomen. &quot;You're bleeding&quot; she said.  Cathy just stared at her, her mind locked in the concept of Trish both lying dead beside her, and standing in the doorway.  Trish repeated &quot;You're bleeding, Cat.  Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're dead&quot; Cathy finally said to the figure, a statement of what she thought to be fact, not a threat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I did die&quot; she answered, walked closer, then leaned against a nearby autopsy table.  &quot;That was my body.  Most of it, anyway.  This is my new one. It's really me, Cat.  I'm Trish.&quot;  She once again looked at Nightprowl's wounded abdomen.  &quot;Cat, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked down at her wound, noting that it looked a lot worse than it felt.  She removed the bandages and nodded lightly to the question, seeing that the blood had clotted in the wound. It was still seeping a bit, but being a mutant had its advantages when it came to healing wounds quickly.  They just stared at each other, both remembering their past together, and all that had happened since they'd been separated.  Trish wanted so badly just to get up and hug her, but she knew Cathy needed time to think about what was happening.  She had two 'Trishes' in the room with her, one long dead, the other still alive.<br />
<br />
It was Cathy who finally spoke up.  &quot;How do I know you're really <i>my</i> Trish?  I've already fought a Paragon Protector with Trish's face, and you were the one I've been chasing.  Why did you lead me down here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That Paragon Protector was a clone - I'm not.  When I was first captured my genes were sampled and found to be... 'compatible' with several Crey experiments, including their cloning process.  Most of this body was made by Dr. Stevenson using another process; one that was in competition with the cloning process used for the Paragon Protectors.  I'm what he calls a duplicate prototype.  I'm real, Cat.  I'm sorry I had to lead you down here, but If I didn't he would've blown up the top floor and <i>everyone</i> would've died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't die.  We get transported to the hospital now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish shook her head.  &quot;I wish we had that during the War... we lost too many people too quickly.  But it's not infallible, Cat.  He's jamming the mediport matrix to prevent anyone here from leaving.  You won't go to the hospital if you get hurt here, you'll just die.  Like I did.  We're both stuck down here, and I can't leave him.  I want to help you escape, but you're going to have to trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
As confused as she was, trust wasn't something Cathy was going to give to anyone just yet.  She worked so hard to find Trish without any success, and now in the span of several minutes she'd found three of them.  She knew the Paragon Protector was a fake, and she was certain that the one lying in the morgue was the real Trish, so this other one must also be a fake.  It was just a very well made fake.<br />
<br />
Cathy's mind was hardening into an impassable wall, a wall where nothing this Trish could say would sway her opinion that <i>her</i> Trish was dead, and anyone who claimed to be her must be a fake.  The Trish in front of her continued her plea, trying to make Cathy believe in her.  &quot;I remember our childhood together.  I remember when you grew your tail.&quot;  She paused for a moment before deciding to continue.  &quot;I know why you really started studying martial arts, and why you moved down to the States.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was hurt by the memory of Trish's last comment and her face hid none of her pain.  In opening a terrible wound from her past, a wound that she had shared with only one other person, this Trish thought that it would sway her to her side.  In fact, it had the opposite effect.  Cathy's mind raced. <i>'They took my friend's memories to use against me - they tortured her until she'd told them everything, then they killed her.  Now they're using that knowledge against me.'</i><br />
<br />
Trish saw her expression and continued. &quot;You didn't do anything wrong, Cat.  <i>He</i> did.  I've told you before, it wasn't your fault back then and it still isn't now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no right to bring that up!&quot; Cathy yelled in loss of composure. This fake Trish was using all the information she'd gotten from her best friend, the friend who was lying dead on the table beside her.<br />
<br />
Trish leaned over to offer Cathy a hug, but her affection was quickly rebuked.  &quot;Don't&quot; Cathy simply said, holding out her palm.  This Trish wasn't hers; it was just another imitation.  She didn't want the fake Trish hugging her for fear that the hug would bring further memories of her dead friend and make it harder to do what she now knew needed to be done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cat, you're in trouble and I want to help.  This whole thing was a setup just to get you here and you fell for it.  You can't win right now. You're in a giant deathtrap that'll go off if Dr. Stevenson doesn't get what he wants, and he wants you.  He's starting to trust me as his assistant, and hopefully that means soon he'll give me more freedom.  When he does I can help you escape, but it won't be today.  You have to be patient or you'll get yourself killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
A light flicked on in Cathy's mind, and she finally understood this Trish's agenda.  It was made to get her to surrender peacefully, without any resistance. This was the doppelganger who had led her away from her teammates. This was the Trish who had tried to trick her into believing she was Cynthia.  Cathy knew she had to be strong if she was to get out of her predicament alive, and she made the decision that Cathy would step into the background of her psyche and Nightprowl would come to the forefront.  Cathy's eyes grew cold and Nightprowl emerged, determined to defeat those who opposed her and prevent Cathy's emotions from overwhelming her.<br />
<br />
<br />
***3***<br />
<br />
<br />
With a grim stare Nightprowl confronted this duplicate Trish.  &quot;You're not my Trish.  My Trish is lying on this table, and somebody's going to pay for her death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cat, please, you're in no position to be aggressive.  He's got this whole place wired to explode, and there's no way out.  It'd take Statesman himself several minutes to bust down even one of the security doors between you and freedom.  You're trapped, just like I've been for a long time.  You've been trapped the moment you entered the building.  We have to plan for the future, because I don't want to see you hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy wasn't listening; Nightprowl had taken control and she would not be as easily swayed by words.  &quot;I'm not the one you should be worried about.  I'm going to make Dr. Stevenson rue the day he ever laid eyes on Nightprowl.  Get out of my way if you don't want to get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish nervously backpedalled towards the door.  &quot;Please Cat, don't make me do this&quot; she replied, taking a couple more steps backwards to buy her time.  Nightprowl kept moving in a confident stride, towards Trish who was now blocking the only exit to the room.  &quot;Get out of my way&quot; Nightprowl coldly demanded.<br />
<br />
But Trish did not move.  She planted her feet and raised her arms, then fired.  A stream of electricity pulsed from her arms, and Nightprowl was wrapped in a sizzling electric sphere.  Her muscles tensed up and she froze in place, unable to move.  Trish shook her head.  &quot;Why did you make me do that?!&quot; she yelled.  In her mind she seemed to be blaming Nightprowl for forcing her hand, but when Nightprowl broke free Trish had her hands full.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not my Trish!&quot; Nightprowl angrily growled, pouncing on her prey and firing a kick to her midsection.  Trish staggered backward, knocking over beakers and scattering tools that were resting on the table behind her.  She tried to cage Nightprowl once more but she powered through the attack.  &quot;Fool me once...&quot; Nightprowl simply stated before delivering another punishing kick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cat, please...&quot; Trish pleaded, sliding away in pain and trying to calm her opponent.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl would have none of it.  Her rage was boiling and Cathy Watts was no longer there to reign her in. &quot;Please?!?  Please!?!&quot; Nightprowl yelled.  &quot;You started it!  You attacked me!  I'm going to end it.&quot;  More kicks thundered through Trish's defenses, and in a desperate moment Trish lurched forward and wrapped herself around Nightprowl, hanging on for dear life.  &quot;I'm sorry, but I have to do this&quot; Trish told her, and the air began to tingle with a huge buildup of electricity.<br />
<br />
They looked each other in the eyes and Nightprowl stopped struggling; this duplicate Trish seemed to share the same emotional connection to Cathy as the original Trish Jackson.  Nightprowl let her eyes go soft and stared into Trish's eyes.  &quot;I'm so sorry, Trish. I don't know what I was thinking&quot; she said, going limp in her arms.  The electricity buildup crackled around them, waiting for the release, but a sincere smile was enough to cause Trish to pause and decide not to go through with the devastating blast.<br />
<br />
In response Nightprowl reared back and slammed her forehead into Trish's head, once, twice, then three times.  An unsettling crack told her that Trish's jaw had been broken by the blows.  Nightprowl pushed away from her grasp and jumped up into a devastating strike, firing out a kick to her face.  Trish dropped to the floor in a heap, bleeding from the mouth and nose and unconscious before she even hit the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may have stolen my friend's powers, but you're not <i>my</i> Trish&quot; she told the unconscious figure on the ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
***4***<br />
<br />
<br />
After saying a tearful goodbye to <i>her</i> Trish, the one lying in the morgue, Nightprowl dragged the duplicate down the hallway towards the office where she knew she'd find the doctor.  When she came to the open door at the end of the hallway Nightprowl entered and dumped the duplicate on the floor.  &quot;I think this is yours&quot; she said to the man behind the desk.<br />
<br />
Without a word the door slid shut behind her with a heavy thump.  The man glanced up and stared for a moment at his new visitor, then smiled and casually motioned her in.  &quot;Yes, yes. Come in, sit down, child.  My name is Doctor Joseph Stevenson, but you can call me Joseph.  Just leave her there for the time being. We've much to discuss, you and I.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Nightprowl wasn't impressed by his nonchalance.  &quot;Sarah Patton.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'That got his interest'</i> she noted, seeing him momentarily pause then look up at her.  The doctor nodded slightly and replied &quot;So you already know about Sarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  Sarah Patton.  My mother who was found dead in the bathroom of a roadside diner, apparently due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head - or was it just made to look like a suicide?  Five other people were also found dead, murdered execution style.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never have killed Sarah.  She was too important to my work.&quot; He thought for a moment.  &quot;I was hoping to gain your trust by giving you information about your mother, but I see someone has beaten me to it.  Ah well, it still leaves me with one parent.  Would you like to know about your father, my child?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not your child&quot; Nightprowl coldly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense! You're every bit as much my child as she is&quot; he said, nodding towards the unconscious and bloodied Trish lying by the door.  &quot;I'm not your <i>biological father</i>, that I will concede, but I <i>am</i> your creator.  You breathe because I gave you life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl said nothing, continuing her grim stare. The doctor took that as a sign to continue.  &quot;Your father's name was Mihail Ivanovich Kuznetsov.  He was a mutant - he could turn into a wolfman, a beast that could tear apart a normal human with a single swipe of his claws.  He was also an assassin for the Soviet Union from the late 60s to the mid 80s, but he disappeared while on a mission to eliminate a British spy operating out of East Berlin.  We believe his mutation finally got the better of him.  It took over his body and turned him into a fearsome beast permanently, though not before he was able to silence the spy.  I have reports of a few sightings of a werewolf south of Berlin, an east german coverup of a soldier describing a 'man-wolf leaping across the no-man's land in a single bound, and an american coverup regarding the killing of what appeared to be a werewolf.  A day after initial reports they revised the encounter as being a rabid dog. A platoon of heavily armed soldiers were dispatched to put down a single rabid dog. <br />
<br />
In the early 70s we had none of the sophisticated equipment we have now, but I was able to convince the Soviets to sponsor a program which would breed assassins who were American citizens loyal to Russia.  You and your sister were part of the pilot program, and were the only successful births from the first batch. Unfortunately, shortly before your birth your mother discovered the real reason why you were being created and escaped from the research facility.  Sarah fled to friends of hers, fellow doctors who were able to help her both to give birth and to hide you and your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I'm so important to you, then why did you try to have me think I was my sister, then when I found the truth tried to have me killed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Killed?  Nonsense!&quot; he said again, as if speaking to a child who didn't understand his grand plan.  &quot;Merely tests, child.  Had you failed you would not have been worth the effort I've put into bringing you here.  I didn't need to bring Nick here - I wanted him to see this place and to know I was here, so that when you questioned him he could tell you where it was.  Didn't you wonder why his plea bargain took so little time?  It was simple, child. He was <i>supposed</i> to guide you here, which he did very effectively.  I was most impressed that you were able to shake off the effects of my drug before Charles Monroe signed over his company to Crey Industries - that was certainly unexpected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why do you want me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're one of my creations, child.  You're like a daughter to me.  I am in the process of... well, let's say it's career advancement.  This facility will be destroyed, and I will soon have a new employer who will be reaping the benefits of my 'severance package'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So in other words, you're stealing Crey secrets to buy yourself a new job, and torching the place to hide your theft&quot; Nightprowl replied.<br />
<br />
<br />
***5***<br />
<br />
<br />
By the time Frozen Rage returned to the security door, Boxcar had just finished hooking up several wires into the panel.  &quot;Okay, Jen, now do your thing&quot; he said aloud, and Jen began to search the research facility's database for a way in  <i>'Oh my'</i> she said to Boxcar, realizing the full scope of the security system's complexity.  <i>'This is impressive.  Very impressive.  This is going to take a while, if I can crack it at all.'<br />
<br />
'Just try your best, Jen'</i> he replied, and to Frozen Rage he said &quot;Jen's got system envy.  This thing's going to be a hard nut to crack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we call in someone else then?&quot; Frozen Rage asked<br />
<br />
&quot;If Jen can't hack it, it can't be hacked.  But she's my girl - she can do it, I know she can!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was busy finding her way through the system and avoiding its internal security, but replied to Boxcar's comment. <i>'Thanks Harvey'</i> she said to him, appreciating his support.<br />
<br />
The minutes dragged and they both waited for Jen to work her magic.  Frozen Rage tried the comm system, hoping that a message would get through the jamming.  &quot;Test, test, test. Night, you there?&quot;  No answer.<br />
<br />
<i>'Oh pooh!'</i> Boxcar heard Jen suddenly exclaim.  <i>'I almost had it, but the darn thing reset on me!'</i><br />
<br />
<i>'Keep trying, Jen'</i> he told her, then turned to Frozen Rage.  &quot;It doesn't look good.  The system reset on her, so it looks like she's only got a certain amount of time to crack the system before it resets on her again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another minute passed, and Rage tried the comm again.  &quot;Test, test, test.  Night, can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***6***<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me, my child&quot; the doctor said to Nightprowl.  &quot;You were never meant to be a hero.  Your genetic design makes you incapable of being a hero.  You're an assassin through-and-through, just like your father.  I can use your talents, and you will be treated like a goddess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Being part cat makes me incapable of being a hero?  I know of many villains sitting behind bars right now who'll disagree with your conclusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor shook his head lightly and frowned, as if disappointed by Nightprowl's comments.  &quot;Your feline attributes is not the mutation which interests me.  It's your other mutation.  The one in your brain.&quot;  The confused look in Nightprowl's eyes told him she still didn't understand what he meant, so he continued.  &quot;I see the coldness in your eyes right now, and I've seen your warm blue eyes when you're happy.  That is the mutation which interests me.  It's the same mutation your father had.  Right now are you not fighting a battle in your mind, trying to calm yourself so as to not be taken over by your rage?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl closed her eyes for a moment, a reflex of internally taking stock of her emotions. &quot;I don't have to fight the rage inside me, because I don't feel it&quot; she lied. The rage in her body simmered, but without Cathy to hold it back it was ready to explode.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah&quot; he replied, not believing her.  He nodded towards the wound in her stomach. &quot;You couldn't keep your emotions in check when my Paragon Protector gave you that wound, could you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't...&quot; she began to give an excuse, but decided she didn't need to answer him.  He was deflecting the real reason why she was here.  Her rage calmed to the point of being manageable but still bubbling, waiting to erupt.  &quot;You're under arrest for the kidnapping and murder of the hero known as Northern Shock.  You have the right to remain...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to arrest me?&quot; the doctor interrupted.  &quot;I tortured and killed your best friend, I even scooped out her insides to use in my duplicate.  Did she tell you that?  That she has your friend's heart and lungs because we never could get the duplicate heart and lung tissue to survive prolonged use of her electric-based powers.  And you still just want to arrest me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl was fuming, trying to control her anger.  In a numb tone she began to repeat the miranda.  &quot;You have the right to...&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook his head, clearly surprised by her actions.  He then beamed a smile.  &quot;Oh, child. You're not like your father at all.  You definitely take after your mother.  Your father would have tried to tear me limb from limb - he would have been unable not to, such is the nature of his mutation.  Your mother... well, she was different.  She was special.  I miscalculated your mother's actions and it cost her her life.  Now I find I've miscalculated your actions as well. For that, I apologize.&quot;  After a moment of thought, a sparkle came to his eye.  &quot;Have you ever killed a person, Cathy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl was locked in thought, wanting so badly to hurt this man in front of her, but knowing that it wasn't the right thing to do.  He had to be arrested and brought to justice through the courts, but the urge to hurt him weighed heavily on her mind.  &quot;Have you ever killed anyone?&quot; the doctor repeated<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe in killing, but for you I could make an exception&quot; she threatened.  It was a threat that she truly meant at that moment.  The doctor seemed to now understand why she wasn't behaving the way he'd anticipated, and his mind began formulating another plan, calculating how to use this new information to his advantage.  He glanced over to the duplicate Trish lying bleeding and unconscious on the floor.  She hadn't killed the duplicate either, even though her friend died to bring the duplicate to life.  He then stared back at Nightprowl. Right then he altered his plans for Cathy... she wasn't ready for him yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know my rights&quot; he sternly stated, suddenly becoming angry. &quot;but you're the one who will be silent.  This facility is locked down, and the only way out is as my captive.&quot;  He pressed a few buttons on his computer and said &quot;Communication with the rest of your team has been restored.  Shortly before you entered my office I started this facility's self destruct countdown.  In less than five minutes this place is going to explode, so I'd suggest telling your teammates to clear the area.  You'll be coming with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like hell I will.  I'd rather die here than go with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's your prerogative, but I'll be leaving shortly, and unless you put on an obedience collar you're not coming with me.&quot;  He opened up a drawer and dumped a heavy steel collar on the desk.  Nightprowl guessed that the internal workings of the collar were most likely identical to what Charles used to keep her in Belize.  There was no way on the face of the earth that she was going to put one of those things around her neck ever again.  She grabbed it, clicked it shut, and threw it across the room.<br />
<br />
The doctor gave a short shake of his head. &quot;Ah well, I had hoped that you would take your place by my side, but I wouldn't want you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.&quot;  The lack of sincerity in his voice was obvious.  Joseph then smiled an evil smile.  &quot;I tortured your friend until she broke, you know.  Until she was a whimpering shell of who she used to be.  I relished turning a hero like her into such a pathetic creature.  I turned her into my servant who would obey me without question, then I killed her for her past transgressions.  She held out long enough to make a fool of me, to let those working on project Revenant Hero to reap the accolades from Crey management.  My duplicates would have been superior to their clones in every way but I lost out to their inferior techniques because she wouldn't co-operate with me in a timely fashion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl's hands balled into fists and all the voices in her mind were yelling at her <i>'KILL HIM!  KILL HIM!'</i>.  Between gritted teeth she said &quot;You are under arrest for the murder of Trish Colleen Jackson.  You have the right to remain silent.  You have the right to an attorney...&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor was impressed by her composure.  &quot;Your friend was a nice experiment, but I have something better planned for your niece, Madison.&quot;<br />
<br />
The world ground to a screeching halt the instant the meaning of those words registered in her mind. Cathy watched in slow motion, unable to do anything to stop her hands from raising up, not sure if she even wanted to stop them.  She watched as Nightprowl's left hand fired up quickly and gripped the doctor's chin firmly under the jaw, wrenching his head back.  She watched Nightprowl's right hand power through, striking the base of the neck with tremendous force.  The sound of shattering bone echoed in her ears, but at that moment there was one thing that permanently burned itself into her mind; it was his eyes.  His eyes seemed to tell her <i>'I knew you could do it, child.  <b>Now</b>, you're just like your father.'</i>  Her father, an assassin who murdered hundreds of people.  Her father, the killer.  Nightprowl, the killer.<br />
<br />
The doctor's body crumpled to the ground, his lifeless eyes staring off into space.  The full weight of what she'd just done crashed down on her.  The emotion she felt as she snapped his neck seemed to lighten a bit but it refused to fade.  The moment recycled once more in her memory.  His words. Her action. His eyes. Her emotion.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was self-defense&quot; she told herself.  <i>'No it wasn't. He attacked only with words.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;He would've hurt Madison&quot; she told herself.  <i>'A vague threat, more words.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;He killed Trish. He was evil&quot; she told herself.  <i>'So you killed him in cold blood. You were his judge, his jury, his executioner.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I killed him. I killed him in cold blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy was shaken from her daze by a voice over her comm.  &quot;Test, test, test.  Night, can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl cleared her throat and keyed the comm as she tried to regain her composure.  &quot;Yeah Rage, I'm here.  Everything's under control now, but this place is set to blow.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***7***<br />
<br />
<br />
Nightprowl heard Boxcar call over the comm.  &quot;Where are you?  Can you release the doors from where you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl scanned the doctor's desk, noting the countdown on the computer.  She tapped a few keys on the keyboard but nothing happened.  &quot;No, I'm locked out.  All I've got on this computer is a damned countdown. 3 minutes and 36 seconds, by the way.  You've got to stop it from your end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're working on bypassing the security doors - we're trying to get them open so you can get out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Nightprowl yelled with a surge of emotion. &quot;I want to save this facility.  Try to stop the self-destruct countdown.  You have to stop the countdown!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Night, if we try to stop the self destruct we won't make it in time, and you're stuck down there.  This system is too complex - Jen's found a less complicated backdoor to the security system, but the self-destruct area is a fortress.  It's like Fort Knox inside the Pentagon inside a bigger Pentagon with combat helicopters circling overhead. This whole place is going up in flames whether we like it or not, and the only question is whether you'll still be down there when it happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl growled in anger.  She wanted to save this complex as evidence, but more importantly she wanted to deliver Trish back to her family where she belonged. She calmed herself and keyed the comm. &quot;Do what you can. Nightprowl out.&quot;  She glared at the security door locking her in the doctor's office, knowing that if that one wasn't there she would at least be able to get Trish's body and carry her up to the surface. <i>'Well, if I get out of here at all. This could be my grave as well.'</i><br />
<br />
Her eyes focused down to the duplicate Trish lying on the floor, still unconscious <i>'It's your fault.  It's all your fault.  If you didn't look like her... if you didn't sound like her...'</i>  &quot;ARGH!&quot; she finally yelled, trying to clear her anger, her emotions, and all her violent thoughts.  Her mind was jacked up on something, and she desperately wanted out of the room.  She didn't want to die today.<br />
<br />
She slumped to the wall, finding a seat beside the duplicate Trish, then she looked at her comm.  Her signal wasn't being jammed any more, so she switched channels from the team communicator to her cell phone, and spoke out. &quot;Call home&quot;.<br />
<br />
The beeps signaled that she had a connection, and after two rings he picked up.  &quot;Hello&quot; Gerald said, and with the sound of his voice a wave of emotion came over her.<br />
<br />
She cleared her throat and after a short pause, replied &quot;Sorry Gerr.  I just had a frog in my throat.  So, how are you doing?&quot; Her mind was racing. <i>'I shouldn't have called.  This was a mistake.  I should just hang up.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know&quot; he sighed, &quot;still getting used to your place - I mean 'our' place.  I was thinking, maybe we could go out for a late dinner tonight.  There's that new Thai place we've been wanting to check out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that sounds great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald sensed the tension in her voice.  &quot;Cathy, are you okay?  You sound upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'm just coming down with something&quot; she said with a sniff of her nose.  &quot;I'm okay.  We'll go to that Thai place tonight. Um, Gerry, I think my cell phone's on the fritz.  I'm going to fiddle around with it, and if I don't call back in ten minutes could you call Harry - Frozen Rage? He's in my phone book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy, are you sure there's nothing wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing!  Honest!&quot; she said defensively, trying not to worry Gerald and failing miserably.  She began getting choked up with emotion and needed to end the phone call she knew she never should have made.  &quot;I can't hear you, my cell phone's going.  Just call Harry in ten minutes, please.  We'll talk about it tonight, at dinner.  I love you Gerry.  Bye.&quot;  She bit her lip and tears escaped from the corner of her eyes, but within seconds she was shaking her head with a renewed sense of determination.  &quot;I'm not going to die today.  Not today, and not for a long time.&quot;  Nightprowl paced the room nervously, the corpse of the evil doctor on one side, and the Trish doppelganger on the other. One minute and forty five seconds chimed the robotic voice.  The doors were still locked and Nightprowl fought the urge to start yelling at Boxcar. <br />
<br />
She eyed the doctor's desk.  <i>'There must be some sort of emergency button; something that could help me.'</i> she thought, leaping over the desk and turning to face the drawers.  She began violently ripping them out of the desk one by one, searching for a button in the drawer, or underneath the desktop.  She yanked hard on the bottom right drawer to find the handle rip loose, the drawer still locked in place. The robotic voice chimed the countdown once more.  <br />
<br />
Nightprowl smashed the drawer with her heel, breaking the front and making it jump its rollers.  She grabbed a hold of the drawer and yanked with all her might, and the drawer finally broke free from the desk.  She looked into the drawer in hopes of finding a way out, a button or a switch, but she found something much different.  It was a silver picture frame, and inside was the smiling face of someone Cathy recognized from earlier that day.  It was an old picture of her mother, Sarah Patton.<br />
<br />
<i>'Why would he have this?'</i> she wondered.  The urge to keep the picture for herself overcame her, and Nightprowl slipped the picture from the frame and slid it into her costume.  She then turned to look at the computer screen to see how much time she had left; there was still the problem of getting out alive.<br />
<br />
<br />
***8***<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage couldn't just stand around waiting, so he began to spray the area in a fine frost.  &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Boxcar asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm trying to buy Night a bit of time.  If I can coat the walls with frost and snow, maybe I can lessen or delay the explosion by a bit. I'll also be able to give her a path to follow so she knows which way's out. It's better than standing around waiting.&quot;  He began using his powers to coat the walls with frost, leaving a pathway to the front door for Nightprowl to follow.<br />
<br />
Jen kept working on cracking the security doors, and after a while Nightprowl spoke up once more on the comm.  &quot;Boxcar,  how are you doing with the doors?&quot; she said.  &quot;If you can't open them it's going to get very hot where I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know.  We're going as fast as we can&quot;  Boxcar called over the comm.  <i>'Please hurry, Jen.  You're her only hope.'</i><br />
<br />
<i>'Hmphf.'</i> Jen replied in a huff. <i>'Maybe she should have thought about that before she went running off by herself.  It's not <b>my</b> fault if she doesn't make it out.'<br />
<br />
'Don't think like that, Jen.  Just do your best with the security interface.'<br />
<br />
'I've almost got it - it hasn't reset on me this time.  I just need another thirty seconds, tops.'</i>  <br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready, less than thirty seconds.&quot;  Boxcar said over the comm.  Just a few seconds after Boxcar told Nightprowl to get ready, the security panel light turned green and the doors slid open.  &quot;Alright Jen!  I knew you could do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen wasn't so sure she'd cracked the system on her own.  <i>'But... I don't think I did it'</i> she replied.  <i>'I was almost there, but I think it opened on its own.'<br />
<br />
'You sure?'<br />
<br />
'Well, no, it's a super complex system but... well, maybe I did do it; I was just a bit surprised when it deactivated.'</i><br />
<br />
<br />
***9***<br />
<br />
<br />
Without warning the door beeped, the light turned green and it quickly slid open.  Nightprowl lept over the desk and as she landed in a crouch she found herself focusing on the duplicate Trish lying on the floor.  She looked at the crumpled mess, the blood on her face hardening and her eyes and cheeks swollen.  <i>'I can't leave her.  I've killed one too many people already today, and I won't let her die here, even if she does deserve to.'</i> She grabbed the duplicate's arm and hoisted her onto her shoulders in a fireman's carry, then ran as fast as she could.<br />
<br />
At 45 seconds she was at the first elevator. <i>'I'm never going to make it'</i> she thought to herself, trying to remember the route back to the surface.  &quot;Everyone out, NOW!&quot; she shouted over the comm.  &quot;I'll be right behind you.&quot;  She burst out of the elevator at full tilt, weaving through rooms and jumping over obstacles with reckless abandon.  <i>'Go-go-go, don't think, just go'</i> she urged her body onward.  &quot;15 seconds until self destruct&quot; chimed the voice once again.  Nightprowl entered the second elevator knowing she wasn't going to get out in time, but she braced against the back wall and repositioned her passenger for the final sprint.  The elevator doors opened and Nightprowl burst into the ground floor hallway to the count of &quot;Ten, nine...&quot; and was surprised by what she saw.  The walls and ceiling were covered in snow and ice, as if she had been dropped into a winter wonderland.  Frozen Rage had covered the entire first floor to delay the impending fireball.  Maybe a couple seconds, but that might be all she needed. &quot;Rage, I could kiss you if I get outta here alive.  Thanks for the path&quot; she said over the comm, following the route left for her and noticing that Frozen Rage had left parts of the walls un-iced to allow for high speed turning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get your feline butt out here in one piece and that'll be payment enough for me&quot; he replied as the robotic voice completed its countdown. &quot;Four, three, two, one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first explosion rumbled from below and nearly knocked Nightprowl into a wall, but she stayed up and kept her feet moving.  To fall now meant death.  A second, then a third explosion rocked the lower levels of the complex. Nightprowl saw the hallway floor buckle and ripple beneath her feet and the duplicate Trish almost slipped off her shoulders.  &quot;I'm not losing you now&quot; she muttered, repositioning her while running at full stride.  Nightprowl planted a foot on the wall and powered through the last corner, and her spirits rose when she saw the backside of the hidden door frozen open.  Beyond that the front entrance was gaping open, its doors an apparent victim of Boxcar's strength.  <i>'Straight shot to safety,'</i> she thought to herself.  <i>'Just pour on the gas and run like hell.'</i><br />
<br />
Her muscles strained, pushed to the limit and beyond, trying to eek every ounce of speed from them.  She ran as fast as she could, but a monstrous explosion erupted from behind.  Her ears rang in pain and her back was seared with heat.  She never made it to the first door before the hot blast wave engulfed them and Nightprowl was lifted up, set off balance by the wave hitting her passenger's body. She flew through the first door and all Nightprowl could do was watch as the ground passed under them, the tile of the research facility turning to the carpet of the insurance agency, and the open front door raced towards her. The thought that they were going to make it dimmed as the hot, painful wave that seared her back and burned her tail continued to lift her upwards.  The top of the wooden door frame seemed to drop into her line of sight, eagerly awaiting the inevitable contact with her head that would surely cave in her skull.<br />
<br />
With the duplicate Trish still draped over her shoulders and preventing her from extending her arms to protect her face, Nightprowl was helpless to do anything but watch the door frame rush up to meet her. The thought <i>'this is gonna hurt'</i> was the last thing that went through her mind before her forehead hit the wooden doorframe and her world went dark.<br />
<br />
<br />
***10***<br />
<br />
<br />
The final explosion caused Frozen Rage to turn as the area was showered in debris, but Boxcar held fast and watched two bodies burst from the front entrance.<br />
<br />
One of the bodies tumbled in a low roll, skipping lightly across the ground, up over the far sidewalk, before rolling to a stop in the empty lot across the street.  Nightprowl's exit was much more disturbing.  She exited the building feet first, violently twisting as if she'd hit something upon exiting. As the person she was carrying slid and rolled low along the street, Nightprowl was vaulted upwards. Her limp limbs flailed as she cartwheeled into the air, rising high enough that a person could've stood underneath and watched her pass over. She landed heavily in the middle of the street with a loud thud before bouncing once and rolling up against the far curb.<br />
<br />
In the seconds following the explosion Paragon City seemed to go silent, the sound of quiet tapping as dust and debris fell to the ground and the creaking of now dangerously unstable building seemed to amplify with what they'd just witnessed.  Frozen Rage suddenly broke the silence after a couple seconds which seemed like minutes.  &quot;Why isn't the mediport matrix transporting them to the hospital?&quot;<br />
<br />
Boxcar bluntly asked &quot;Does it transport the dead, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage didn't respond, he ran to Nightprowl instead.  Her body was crumpled awkwardly face down in the street and her tail was still smoldering from the explosion.  The back of her costume was blackened and charred, and blood splattered the the concrete around her head.   Frozen Rage quickly sprayed a jet of cold mist across her to stop any further burning then carefully turned her over.  Nightprowl's face was a bloody mess and her carbon fibre mask was shattered, its inner kevlar weave the only thing still holding it together. Her head rolled back lifelessly and her mouth gaped open.  &quot;Aw, Cathy&quot; he sighed.  &quot;Why didn't you listen to me?  You shouldn't have run off like that. You should've listened to me.&quot;  He looked over to Boxcar, who was checking on the other body.  Boxcar saw that she was still breathing and gave Rage a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage looked down at his teammate who still hadn't drawn a breath, and had yet to show any sign of life.  Crimson caked her hair and forehead through the remains of her shattered mask and a thick coat of blood covered her nose and cheek. At the moment it looked most grim, a small, bloody bubble slowly emerged from a nostril, then retreated back from where it came.  &quot;She's still breathing! She's alive!&quot; he yelled out.<br />
<br />
