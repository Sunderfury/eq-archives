			<description><![CDATA[A friend of mine applied to be a game programmer, however, they are telling him that there will be a "coding stimulation" next week for the applicants. 

He's trying to figure out what this is so he can be prepared. Any of you in the computer industry able to provide assistance?

Thanks!]]></description>
