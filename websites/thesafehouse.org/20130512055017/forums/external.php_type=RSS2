			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>She was my favorite niece. She was smart, and weird, and didn't really seem to fit in with the rest of the family just like me. My wife's family to be honest, but I also don't fit in with my own family so it's all the same thing really. <br />
<br />
Monday she parked her car on the same set of railroad tracks her brother did nine years ago. She took his death hard, depression, drugs, the &quot;normal&quot; gambit. I was so angry with her Monday I could barely speak. I finally broke down and cried when I had to explain to my daughter what happened. <br />
<br />
This is the third time in my life I've had to deal with suicide. I really don't think I handle it well. It makes me feel angry towards the person who did it. I have had some pretty shitty times in my life, and the only reason suicide has entered my mind is I wouldn't do it because &quot;they&quot; would win. I'm not going to let someone else beat me. I try to not judge other people by my life experiences and I know everyone walks their path differently.<br />
<br />
I wish she would have called me. I might not have been able to stop her, but I would have at least reminded her that there are people who love her and will have a hard time living life without her.</div>

And **** that ******* on craigslist who keeps listing garbage postings with a link embedded in a picture to his realtor site that asks you to fill out info form. And **** landlords in general. ONE GOD DAMNED JOB. THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE. Give me an admittedly overpriced place to live in without it having rats, or leaks or what the **** ever--I've done it before, it isn't that ****ing hard you god damned lazy shitsacks.<br />

God, I love this city, but this aspect of living here needs to ****ing vanish.</div>

<br />
...and my goddamn bank account is overdrawn, and I can't afford gas 'till I get my paycheck tomorrow. DAMN. That complicates things. I don't have a lot of room in my little seattle apartment to actually do the critical things like cleaning and sorting and whatnot, and I have to just pack everything best I can 'till the money hits my bank sometime tomorrow, then actually move/clean everything  and hopefully not have any big issues come up, so that I can do the final clean up and whatnot before work on saturday. (I work swing shift, so I at least get all morning for that)<br />
<br />
There's always something that comes up when I move, no matter how far in advance I plan it.<br />
<br />
<i>Note: I had originally been told I didn't have to be out of my apartment 'till Tuesday, so I'm losing a few days due to a paperwork snafu</i></div>
