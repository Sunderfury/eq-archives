<br />
<br />
<i>Cathy sat in the bus stop shelter, patiently waiting with her hands folded in her lap.  A masked face peered down on her from out over the edge of its roof, looking at her upside-down.  &quot;Whatcha doin'?&quot; the masked figure asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm waiting for the bus Nightprowl, just like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you Cathy?  How come you're so small?&quot; she replied<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not small, I'm the same size you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you're not, you're tiny!  You're just a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked at her hands; they were smaller than they should be.  She stood up and tipped forward, falling off balance and stumbling to catch herself.  &quot;What the?!&quot; she said, looking behind her and noticing something was wrong - she didn't have a tail.  She looked at her reflection in the dirty, broken glass of the bus stop shelter.  She was just a kid, wearing her old school uniform.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl pointed and laughed. &quot;Ha-ha, you're just a kid!  You don't have a tail, so you must be about 14 years old.  I'm the adult now, so you have to do what I say!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I </i>am<i> not a kid.  I'm just in the wrong body.  I'm in our old body, before the mutation.  I'm still as old as you are, maybe even older - you seem to be the one acting like a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl leaned further over the edge of the roof and silently slid down to the ground.  &quot;I do feel weird. Frisky.  Edgy.  I've got our normal body though, so that means I'm the adult.  Who are they going to believe, me or you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked around.  &quot;What do you mean 'they'?  There's nobody here.  What happened to us anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno.  I think we're dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not dead&quot; Cathy argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we are.  We're dead, and this is hell.  Look at all the destroyed buildings.  All the rubble on the ground.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not dead and we're not in hell.  I know that for a fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be so certain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There aren't any lawyers.  Besides, I think remember this place.  We're in Boomtown.  We used to patrol here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!  I remember now.&quot; Nightprowl replied.  &quot;So, why are we here then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't really Boomtown, it's just made up.  It's in our mind - we must be dreaming or something.  I just know we have to wait for the bus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'm getting that feeling too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy sat back down, Nightprowl sat down beside her, and they both resumed waiting for the bus.  After a few seconds, Nightprowl began tapping her foot.  &quot;Stop fidgeting&quot; Cathy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do what I want.  I'm the adult here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy sighed and shook her head.  Nightprowl stopped tapping her foot, and began staring at Cathy.  She leaned back and looked at Cathy's backside then said &quot;So how does it feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How does what feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not having a tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's weird.  I don't like it.&quot;  Cathy looked back at Nightprowl.  &quot;What do you remember last?  I'm having trouble remembering stuff.  I remember some of the things that happened a long time ago, but I think there's something wrong with our memory.   I remember Christmas, or winter or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, me too. No wait, it was indoor snow.  It must've been fake, like they use in department stores, 'cause it can't snow indoors.  We were running though.  I remember running really fast - and we were scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both sat quietly for a few minutes, when Nightprowl suddenly spoke up.  &quot;Bones breaking.  I remember that.  I liked that part.  Oh! Oh! Oh!  I remember! We snapped a guy's neck!  A doctor's neck!&quot;  She smiled at the memory, and looked at Cathy.  &quot;I wanna do that again... that was a rush.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked back at her with a fierce stare.  &quot;We're not going to do that again.  We don't kill people.  End of discussion.&quot;<br />
<br />
The intimidation of Cathy's stare was dulled by her youthful appearance, and Nightprowl argued back.  &quot;Yes we do.  We killed Doctor John. No, Jacob... no, Joe. Doctor Joseph!  That's who he was!  Doctor Joseph!  I liked killing him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I didn't.  It was a mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I did, and I'm the adult now, so we have to do what I say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not the adult!  I'm in charge, I've always been in charge, and I always will be in charge whether I look like a woman, a teenager, or an old lady!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl stuck her tongue out at Cathy.  &quot;I'm bigger than you.  If we fought each other you'd lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the rules.  We can't fight, and I'm in charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just telling you how I see it.  And the rule about you being in charge is open to interpretation, with you being a miner and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's 'or', not 'er'. I'm a minor, not a miner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl jumped to her feet in front of Cathy. &quot;Ha-ha, made you say it!  I'm an adult, and you're a minor, so I'm in charge!&quot;  She then lept onto the top of the bus stop and out of sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get back here!  You're NOT in charge!&quot; Cathy yelled, standing up and walking out to get a look on top of the bus stop shelter.  She jumped up and grabbed the edge of the roof then began to pull herself up, but as her head cleared the top of the roof she found Nightprowl crouched low and smiling at her, their faces less than an inch apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good news, bad news!&quot; Nightprowl blurted out with a grin.  &quot;Good news is it looks like you're getting a bit older.  Bad news is your bum's showing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy dropped down to the ground and looked behind her.  Her skirt was raised up and a new tail was poking out from underneath. After blushing then rearranging her skirt to hide her tail like she used to do in high school, she got back to trying to control Nightprowl.  She looked on top of the bus stop shelter but she was nowhere to be seen.  After scanning the area she heard Nightprowl call out from behind her.  &quot;Cathy! Cathy! Look who I found!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy turned around to find Nightprowl standing beside Doctor Joseph Stevenson, her arm draped around his shoulders.  &quot;Now watch this!&quot; she said with an evil grin, turning to the doctor and grabbing him forcefully by the throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Cathy yelled, but she was helpless to do anything but watch Nightprowl power through a vicious strike, breaking the doctor's neck.  The doctor crumpled to the ground just as he did when they killed him the first time.  &quot;Stop it, right now!  I'm not playing around anymore.  No more killing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl gave Cathy a defiant stare, then looked down to the corpse of Joseph Stevenson.  As if being rewound, he rose up from the ground and stood beside Nightprowl.  &quot;It's in our memory though, so I have to kill him this way&quot; she said, grabbing him once more and repeating the fatal blow.  The doctor dropped to the ground and Nightprowl looked back at Cathy with a wicked smile on her face.  &quot;The next time we kill I want to do it differently... maybe a kick to the head.  Or something with lots of blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young Cathy was flustered and upset with trying to control the unruly Nightprowl. &quot;There won't be a next time! You have to play by the rules!  I'm in charge here, and you have to do what I say!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl kicked the ground and pouted.  &quot;I don't like you anymore.  We can't always do what <b>you</b> want, you know.  Sometimes we have to do what I want, and this is what I want to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've seen enough&quot; announced a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
Cathy turned and saw a man standing a short distance away.  &quot;I know you, don't I?&quot; she asked<br />
<br />
Nightprowl smiled and lept to his side.  &quot;Hi Gerr!  You don't remember Gerry, Cathy?  I like how he makes me feel too.&quot;  She turned to Gerald. &quot;Ignore her, she's jailbait now.&quot;  She rubbed up against Gerald, making an obvious sexual advance.  Gerald did nothing to encourage or dissuade her actions.  &quot;Gerry, I think you should know that I like thing a bit differently from Cathy. I want you to...&quot; she stopped and grinned mischievously at Cathy, then whispered the rest of her request in Gerald's ear while she ran her hand across his chest.  Gerald's face was devoid of emotion, even when Nightprowl began kissing his neck and nibbling on his earlobe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nightprowl, stop that right now!&quot; Cathy yelled, but before she could do anything else Nightprowl began to lift off the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what's the big idea?&quot; Nightprowl said.  &quot;I'm just having a little fun, Gerry.  Now put me down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald's face was somber when he replied.  &quot;I'm going to have to put you away for a while, Nightprowl.  You've already caused too much damage to Cathy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl suddenly became angry. &quot;Gerald Irvin Simms, I <b>demand</b> that you put me down right now!  If you don't, you can forget about everything that I whispered in your ear!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald began to levitate off the ground, then turned to Cathy.  &quot;I'll be back in a little while.  You stay here.&quot;  Before Cathy could say anything, Gerald flew off with Nightprowl in tow.<br />
<br />
Cathy watched them disappear into the distance, and after a few moments forgot what she was looking at.  &quot;I have to wait for the bus&quot; she reminded herself, then sat back down at the bus stop. She waited for a while, and the man approached once again.  &quot;Hello&quot; Cathy greeted him, struggling to remember his face.  &quot;You were here before, weren't you? I've forgotten your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I was.  My name's Gerald. Gerald Simms&quot; he said with a pained smile, troubled by the poor shape of her memory.  &quot;May I sit down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but I don't think you're allowed on the bus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know. The bus is for you.  I just wanted to talk for a little while, then I'll be leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
They sat and talked, and Gerald used his knowledge of the human mind as well as skills he learned in his youth to try and help Cathy with her memory while searching for the one question he needed answered.  He needed to find out whether Cathy was preparing to come out of her coma, or whether she was preparing to pass on.  Cathy answered honestly and to the best of her abilities, and Gerald began to relax as their talk went on, finding clear signs that she wasn't preparing herself for the afterlife.<br />
<br />
After a long conversation in which Cathy aged several more years, now appearing as an attractive young adult, Gerald decided it was time to let Cathy recover on her own and take the final journey to consciousness.  &quot;Is there anything you'd like to tell me that I haven't brought up?&quot;  Gerald asked, trying to make sure she didn't have any more questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm having trouble remembering things.  And I'm really not this young.  I get the feeling I should be older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald smiled. &quot;Well, not that much older, but yes.  You're rebuilding yourself.  You'll get older before the bus comes. It's been good talking to you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy smiled back at him. &quot;You have a nice smile.  I remember that smile... I call you Gerry, don't I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald bit his lip to hide his emotion, his heart warmed by Cathy's recognition of him.  &quot;Yes, yes you do.  You're remembering things - that's good.  That's very good.  Cathy, I can't stay much longer, but can you promise me one thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you'll be okay, but promise me that if Nightprowl comes back you'll call out to me.  Yell for me as loudly as you can, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she was waiting for the bus.  It's her bus too.  She was around here somewhere,&quot; Cathy replied, scanning the area and trying to remember the last time she saw Nightprowl.  &quot;I think she went exploring or something.  Or maybe I had an argument with her... we haven't been agreeing on things lately.&quot;  Cathy shook her head and stared at the ground, trying to remember.  &quot;I don't like not being able to remember.  It sucks.  I don't like it at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald put his hand on her shoulder.  &quot;It's okay Cathy, you just have to be patient.  I promise your memory will get much better before the bus arrives.  I have to go now, but you just stay here and keep remembering things, okay?&quot;  He leaned over and kissed her lightly on the cheek, remembering their phone conversation before Cathy was knocked into a coma.  &quot;I love you too&quot; he said with a crack in his voice, and by the time Cathy turned to look at him he was gone.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
***2***<br />
<br />
<br />
The smell was the first thing that registered in Cathy's mind.  A mixture of burnt hair and flesh combined with the unmistakeable aroma of a hospital ward.  <i>'Good lord, my head hurts'</i> she thought, trying to remember what had happened over the throbbing of her brain. <i>'I'm on my back'</i> she realized as she began to regain consciousness. She slowly opened her eyes and was blinded for a moment by the brightness, but as her vision adjusted she took stock of her surroundings.  She rolled her head to the right and found her favourite stuffed animal, a dog named Foofer that she'd had since she was just a little child, lying in the bed with her.  At his feet was Madison's favourite toy, the red rubber ball she would chase around her home.  Cathy smiled at the thoughtfulness of the two items, and rolled her head over to the left.<br />
<br />
To her left was a patient lying in another bed beside her.  The patient's head was completely bandaged, but Cathy recognized the wisps of hair which strayed out from underneath.  It must be the duplicate Trish.  An IV slowly dripped its contents into her arm, and she appeared to be sleeping.  Cathy realized she had an IV in her own arm as well.  <br />
<br />
<i>'I'm lying on my back'</i> she thought to herself again, still groggy and trying to think. <i>'My tail... I can't be on my back.'</i>  She raised quickly from the bed and the room suddenly spun, and her head throbbed in pain.  She closed her eyes to combat the spinning room and raised a hand to her forehead; it was wrapped in bandages.  &quot;Oh, my head&quot;.  Her mind was fuzzy; it seemed quiet - empty. <i>'It must be the drugs they're giving me.'</i> <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back.&quot;  She heard Gerald's voice from the other side of the bed and tilted her head towards it, though she kept her eyes close.<br />
<br />
&quot;My tail&quot;  Cathy weakly whispered. &quot;I can't feel my tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, lie down.  You're going to be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes into slits and gazed at Gerald.  &quot;My tail.  I can't feel it&quot; she repeated, and the fear that she might have lost it caused a quickening of beeps from the heart monitor beside the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's still there, but it was burnt pretty badly. The doctor has been giving you anesthesia so it won't hurt.  That's why you can't feel it.  There aren't any third degree burns on it though, so the hair should grow back.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cathy was still puzzled from waking up, and still not sure how she could be lying on her back if she still had her tail.  &quot;My tail.. I'm lying down...&quot; she was trying to choose the right words, but couldn't think of them.<br />
<br />
Gerald was at her side and helping to lower her back down onto the bed when he understood what Cathy was trying to say.  &quot;There's a slit in the bed made specially for your tail; that's why you can rest on your back.  Paragon City hospitals get quite a few heroes with tails...&quot; he began explaining, but Cathy closed her eyes and laid back in bed, and began nodding slowly like she did whenever she wasn't really listening to him but didn't want to appear rude.  Gerald leaned over and kissed her lightly, then quietly said &quot;You get some sleep.  I'm going to make some phone calls, and I'll be back in fifteen minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one moment, Miss Watts&quot; an unfamiliar voice spoke up loudly.  Cathy winced as the throbbing in her head returned. &quot;Quietly...  Talk quietly.  What do you want?&quot; she said, but Gerald interrupted.  &quot;She's not taking any of your questions now&quot; he said in a low, stern voice.&quot;  Cathy opened her eyes and looked at the man; <i>'G-man'</i> she immediately thought, and she noticed another one behind him.  <i>'They must be here for the duplicate.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, Gerry.  You make your calls; this won't take long.&quot;  She looked over at the man. &quot;It's about Trish, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma'am&quot; he said in a quieter tone.  &quot;It's about your friend here.  Because legally she's been declared dead, and because she is a hero with a secret identity...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trish <b>is</b> dead.  I saw her body&quot; Cathy coldly interrupted, making sure to meet the man's eyes.  &quot;The person in the next bed is a duplicate; a fake.&quot;  Cathy heard the mumbling from beside her and turned to face the duplicate Trish.  Her face was bandaged and her broken jaw was wired shut, and Cathy found it easy to dismiss this pale copy of her best friend.  Only her eyes were available to plead to Cathy, and those were not enough.  It was time to end this painful chapter in her life.  She stared in the duplicate's eyes and said &quot;The only reason I saved you was because you were the only person there who I <i>could</i> save.  I did it because saving people is my job, but I'm not going to forget that the reason Trish is dead is because you're alive.  You have her organs inside you, but you're not her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy saw the pain in the duplicate's eyes and for a moment felt sorry for what she had done.  She turned to face the man once more, and said to him &quot;Trish is dead.  My Trish is dead, and I will protect her hero identity even after her death.  Is there anything else?&quot; she added, trying to block out the upset mumbling from the patient beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no ma'am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy sunk back into the bed and looked to her right, inspecting the tufts of hair on her stuffed animal and trying to ignore the incoherent mumbling of the woman in the next bed.  As the adrenaline from the conversation wore off Cathy's eyes got heavy and she drifted back to sleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
***3***<br />
<br />
<br />
When Cathy next awoke the duplicate was gone and her room was empty.  The throbbing had lessened but she was still in a fog; her mind was dulled and quieted by the drugs.  Gerald was the first to greet her again.  She was scanning the room just as Gerald entered.  &quot;Oh, you're awake&quot; he said.  &quot;I just went to get some coffee. Do you feel any better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too much drugs.  I don't feel right&quot; she replied.  Her mouth felt fuzzy and her throat was sore, but she was happy to feel the throbbing in her tail; it was still there.  &quot;What happened?  The last thing I remember I was running as fast as I could, then I woke up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were hurt very badly, Cathy.  You were caught in an explosion and hit your head, and you've been in a coma for four days.&quot;  He sat down on the bed beside her and looked in her eyes.  &quot;What happened with you and Trish?  She...&quot; Gerald began, but Cathy cut him off quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to talk about it.&quot;  As she finally began getting her strength back she started searching for the controls to the hospital bed.  &quot;How do you raise this thing up?&quot;  Gerald pressed a button on the side of the bed and it slowly rose up.  &quot;Okay, that's good.  Thanks.&quot;  She looked over to her right and picked up Madison's ball, gripped it, tossed it up and caught it.  &quot;Is Madison here?&quot; she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;They came by earlier but you were still sleeping, so Charles and Simon took her down for breakfast in the cafeteria.  They should be back soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy raised the sheets and looked down at her body.  She was wearing a hospital gown.  &quot;Do I have a change of clothes here?&quot; she asked.  &quot;I'm taking a wild guess that my costume is pretty much toast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes, I brought a change of clothes for you, but you're still hurt.  It'll still be a few days before you can leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy swung her legs off the side of the bed.  &quot;I'm fine&quot; she said against the throbbing in her head as her feet touched the ground.  She put her weight on her feet and her knees rocked and buckled, then the room started tumbling.  She was halfway to the ground before Gerald was able to use his powers of telekinesis to catch her in mid air.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still think you're fine?&quot; Gerald asked as he lifted her up with his mind and placed her back in bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, maybe not so fine.  I still don't want to be here&quot; she pouted<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather you be home and safe too, but being here is a lot better than being in the morgue.  You almost died, Cathy!  At least give the doctors a couple more days to make sure you don't have any serious side effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One day.  They get one more day.  I don't like it here, and the drugs they're giving me are affecting my mind. I feel empty, alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald debated in his mind whether he should tell her it wasn't the drugs.  Whether he should tell her what he'd done.  How he'd searched her mind while she was in the coma, finding the memories of her confrontation with Dr. Stevenson and the truth about her birth father.  How he'd watched her struggle to control the actions of her alter ego and how he had locked away the bloodlusting Nightprowl so it wouldn't infect her while she recovered.  <i>'No good can come of telling her'</i> he thought to himself.  He had to make sure Cathy got better, not worse. She might never be Nightprowl again, but it was better than turning into the murderous beast of her father.<br />
<br />
As Gerald was mulling over what he'd done to Cathy's mind, a hero walked into the room.  &quot;Knock knock&quot; Boxcar said from the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Boxcar.  I didn't expect to see you here.  I mean, I'm grateful you came to see me, but we barely know each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I wasn't here just to visit you.  I had a talk with your friend, Trish.  She seems nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not my friend.  My friend is dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because she's admitted she's a 'duplicate'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw Trish dead in the facility's morgue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy glared at Gerald, wondering why he wasn't agreeing with her.  Gerald shook his head and held up his arms. &quot;No way. Don't drag me into this. I knew her too, remember?  Back when she'd come see you at The Nightprowler before the Rikti War.  I talked to her a few times while you were still in your coma and I agree with Boxcar - you should give her the benefit of the doubt, regardless of who you think she is now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren't down there when she attacked me, Gerry&quot; Cathy replied, then focused her attention on Boxcar. &quot;As I was saying, 'So' there's only one Trish, and she's dead.  The one I saved was an imitation - a copy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she and I hit hit off because we've been through a similar situation&quot; Boxcar replied.  &quot;I'm a copy. Hell, I still have my ashes in an urn back at my place. I still consider myself 'Harvey Grace', the same person I was before my accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but...&quot; Cathy replied, trying to find a reason why Boxcar's situation was different.  &quot;You're different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm not.  I stepped into a battlesuit, Jen uploaded my brain into her memory system, and I died.  When I awoke I was joined at the hip with Jen and my body was a smoldering pile of dust. Your friend died, and when she awoke she was in a different body but remembered everything about her past.  You can't seem to get it through your thick head that Trish isn't dead, she's just different.  She was crying when she gave me this to give to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Boxcar held out a sealed envelope towards Cathy, but she just shook her head.  &quot;I don't want it.  She'll just try and convince me that she isn't a fake.  She was working for the doctor, and even when she was trying to convince me to surrender she was talking about helping 'me' escape, not 'us' escape.  She had no intention of leaving Dr. Stevenson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should tell you a little story, Nightprowl.  You see there were these two women who barely escaped from a massive explosion.&quot;  Cathy's eyes narrowed and she gritted her teeth, but said nothing, letting Boxcar continue his story.  &quot;I mean, these two women got blown out of a building and into the middle of the street.  It looked ugly.  The heroes on the scene thought they were pickin' up corpses for sure, but miracle of miracles, both of them still had pulses.  For some reason the two weren't automatically transported to the hospital, so the call for a transport was sent out, and luckily within minutes both of them were being taken care of by hospital staff.<br />
<br />
One of them, the one without the tail, awoke while she was still in the emergency room.  She started ranting and carrying on, yelling something nobody could understand. &quot;Eh huh Buhm! Eh Buhm!&quot; she was moaning through a broken and swollen jaw.  The doctor gave her a sedative to calm her, but before she nodded off one of the nurses finally understood what she was trying to say.  &quot;Bomb?  Are you trying to say 'Bomb?'&quot; the nurse asked her, and the patient pointed to her chest and nodded.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, that area of the hospital was cleared out in a hurry, leaving myself, and a volunteer doctor and nurse who were more concerned for their patient than their own safety. Night, she had plastic explosives surgically implanted into her abdomen, wired to a remote detonator.  I thought that you should know that she was still a prisoner of the doctor, even if she wasn't locked away in a cell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy just looked away, not wanting to be swayed from the decision she'd already made, the decision that Trish was dead.  Boxcar placed the envelope on the table beside a couple get well cards, and said &quot;I don't know what it says, but you should read it.&quot;  She just pouted and continued looking away, trying to sense whether Boxcar had left the room yet.  Boxcar realized she wasn't willing to be swayed, but felt he had tried his best.  As he was leaving he mentioned &quot;She was right.  You can be very stubborn when you want to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy barely heard the comment.  In her head she was going over her emotions, thinking to herself <i>'I can't go through this again.  It was hard enough losing her the first time, going through the funeral and the mourning, then gaining hope with clues found in Paragon City only to have them dashed once more with her real body lying on a slab in the research facility's morgue.  That had to be the confirmation, the final end.  Now there's this 'new' Trish who would only set me up to be hurt once more.  No, I can't do that.  Trish is dead. She has to be dead.'</i><br />
<br />
<br />
***4***<br />
<br />
<br />
For days after being released from the hospital Cathy was in a funk.  She felt different, unsure, quiet, alone, and she kept remembering a line that Gerald told her: &quot;If Nightprowl comes back call out to me&quot;.  <i>'Why would he say that?  When would he have said that?'</i>  She decided to ask Gerald, but when he heard the line she saw the look on his face and knew that she hadn't dreamed it.  &quot;How do you know that line?  I'm Nightprowl, so why would you say something like that to me, and why don't I remember it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald took too much time to think of an excuse, and Cathy connected the dots.  &quot;You did something to me, didn't you?  You went into my mind. Played with it - erased things.  That's why I feel so empty inside.&quot;  Cathy could see the look of guilt on his face and pounced &quot;What the hell did you do to me, Gerry?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saved you!  That's what I did!&quot; he yelled back.  &quot;Nightprowl was destroying you!  She killed a human being and enjoyed it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nightprowl?  I'm Nightprowl!  What are you talking about?!  You had no right to invade my mind!  I want you to undo whatever you've done, right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy, you don't understand.  I know about your father.  I found his name in your memory while I was trying to find out what happened to you, and at work I checked him out.  I found dozens and dozens of files on him.  When he changed into his animal form he was a murderous beast. I found that beast inside your mind, and it was feeding off what you'd done to Dr. Stevenson.  It was turning you into a monster!  I won't let you turn into a cold-blooded killer.  I love you too much to just stand by and watch that happen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy paused at the admission that he loved her, that he was trying to help her, but she couldn't live with part of her mind locked away. &quot;You can't invade my mind like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I <i>wanted</i> to intrude into your mind?!  Cat, I thought you were going to die!  I would have done <b>anything</b> to save you, and I had to find out if you were going to be okay.  I never intended to do anything to you, I just wanting to check to see if you'd be okay.  When I saw Nightprowl doing the things she was doing, I couldn't just stand back and let her ruin you, turn you into a killer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't understand Gerry,&quot;  She looked him square in the eyes. &quot;Nightprowl didn't kill the doctor.  The mutation inside me didn't kill the doctor.  I killed the doctor and take full responsibility for my actions.  He was a dangerous man who killed my best friend and threatened my niece, and I won't stand for that.  He got what he deserved.  Maybe that part of my mind enjoyed it, but I didn't and I'm the one in control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Cat...&quot; Gerald began to argue, knowing that she couldn't understand the force locked away in her mind until it was out and doing damage, but Cathy was quick to stop him.  With a quiver of hurt and sadness in her voice she said  &quot;You're going to put me back to the way I was or you're going to get out of my life... forever. Choose now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald knew he'd lost, Cathy's mind was made up and Gerald fully believed she would carry out her ultimatum if Gerald refused.  With a defeated voice he replied &quot;You'll need to be sleeping, because I can't go that deep into your mind while you're awake.  A sleeping pill or two might help as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wiping away the tears that had welled up in her eyes she replied &quot;Tonight, then.  You'll do it tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the day was uncomfortable for both of them, with a few small arguments scattered through the evening.  Cathy felt hurt and betrayed, and Gerald was afraid of what would happen once Nightprowl was released.  He knew that she couldn't understand the fierce beast he witnessed, and he only hoped that she was right; that she could control it.  They stayed to themselves, finding things to do in separate rooms and having a silent dinner together.  Shortly after eight o'clock Cathy announced to Gerald that she was going to bed, then left to prepare for sleep.<br />
<br />
A few hours later Gerald walked into the bedroom and saw Cathy sleeping quietly, curled on her side and nuzzling against a pillow that had taken the place normally occupied by Gerald.  He sighed at what he promised to do, then went back in the kitchen to get a chair.  He brought the chair back to the bedroom, placed it beside the bed, then sat down.  For a minute he just watched her sleep peacefully, then he began concentrating.  He slipped past her dream state and dove deep into her mind.  Within seconds he was standing back in Boomtown, in Cathy's mental re-creation of Boomtown.  It was time to release Nightprowl.<br />
<br />
<br />
***5***<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Gerald observed Nightprowl from a distance, noting she was still restrained exactly as Gerald had left her.  She was sitting with her back against a heavy steel beam jutting vertically from the ground, her feet straight out in front of her.  Heavy metal rods had been wrapped around her body, two holding her legs together and five going around her arms and torso as well as the beam, holding her firmly against the steel post.  A final steel rod was wrapped around her neck and the steel beam, giving her very little movement.<br />
<br />
Gerald approached cautiously; her head was lowered and she wasn't moving.  As he neared she looked up and for a moment Gerald thought he saw sadness and pain on her face, but in an instant a more familiar emotion rose to the surface - rage.  A snarl came to her lips and she started struggling against her bindings.  She seemed to go into a semi-feral state, grunting and hissing like an animal.  &quot;Let me go! Let me go! LET ME GO!&quot; she yelled.  She was working herself into a frenzy, rocking and tugging against the metal bars.  &quot;LET ME GO!  AAARRGGHHHH!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald knelt in closely to her and looked into her eyes.  Her eyes were unlike anything he'd seen; they weren't the warm blue eyes of Cathy, and they weren't the cool, icy eyes of Nightprowl.  These eyes seemed to emit a dark blue glow of their own, filling the sockets with a dull luminance.  &quot;Shhhh&quot; he said lightly, stroking her hair.  &quot;I'm sorry. I'm here to make things right&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl's anger slowly waned, and her eyes drooped with sadness.  &quot;I can't protect us here&quot; she said.  &quot;I need to protect us. Let me go.  Let me go!&quot; she began to get angry, her animal instincts regaining control.<br />
<br />
Gerald quickly comforted her.  &quot;Shhhh.  It's okay. I'll let you go, but I just want to talk to you first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl's emotions were a pendulum, swinging wildly between sadness and rage.  &quot;I can't move... I can't protect us.  I need to protect us!  I need to move... I need to go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald shook his head and muttered under his breath at Nightprowl's single-minded thought process. &quot;Poor beast.  Poor, poor beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl heard the comment and her eyes narrowed, and Gerald was dumbfounded by her response.  &quot;Beast?!?  Beast!?!  Listen, you arrogant little puke!  You invaded my mind while I was hurt, damaged, and confused, and you locked me away because you didn't like the thoughts I was having!  I trusted you not to hurt me and you betrayed that trust!  If you hope to salvage anything of what's left of my respect and trust, you'd better let me go this instant, Gerry! LET ME GO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl's mouth was laced in spittle from the outburst and her breath heaved in anger, but Gerald could plainly see that she was no beast; she was angry and violent, but she was just as intelligent as Cathy herself.  Gerald placed his hand on the bar around Nightprowl's neck and it disappeared; he did the same with the bars around her feet and they disappeared as well.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl moved her neck and pulled her legs up towards her, but she still had five thick metal bars restraining her arms and torso.  She didn't even consider thanking Gerald; she simply looked at him with those dark eyes and with a low, angry growl said &quot;All of them. You invaded my mind and attacked me, and my ability to forgive you is wearing very thin. Until I'm <b>fully</b> released I have <b>nothing</b> to say to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald debated in his mind whether he should try to talk to Nightprowl anyway, but the look in those eyes told him this wasn't a negotiation and he knew that he had to release Nightprowl; Cathy demanded it.  To anger her further might make it harder for Cathy to control her.  he placed his hands on the remaining bars and in an instant they disappeared.  Nightprowl was free once again.<br />
<br />
The instant the final bindings were removed, Nightprowl's hand shot up and gripped Gerald's throat.  She felt herself start to lift up off the ground but gave a quick tug on Gerald's neck, forcing him to cough and drop her back down.  She raised herself to her feet, still clutching Gerald's throat, and when they were both standing she brought her face nose to nose with Gerald's. Her nostrils flared in anger as air rushed in and out, and her eyes beamed with hatred.  She seemed to study his eyes, his lips, his face, before stating plainly  &quot;The only reason I don't kill you right this second is because Cathy likes you.  If you <b>ever</b> try anything like that again I'll snap you in half.  Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;  She released her grip, then without a second's consideration of the threat she'd just made to Gerald, she stepped back from him and began to stretch.  She looked at Gerald and said &quot;You stay here; I've been cooped up for too long, and I want to do some jumping before we leave.  I'll be back... when I feel like it.&quot;  She jumped high into the air, onto a nearby ledge, then off into the distance.<br />
<br />
He waiting longer than he wanted to, then began to suspect Nightprowl wasn't coming back.  After a moment of thought, he knew where he was going to find her and in a blink of an eye he was standing at the bus stop, beside Nightprowl.  She was waiting for her bus. &quot;You were trying to ditch me&quot; Gerald noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we talk some more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  Cathy needs me.  The longer I'm here the longer she has to protect herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say you want to protect Cathy.  Do you protect her by killing people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dead people can't hurt us.  Leaving bad people alive just means you have to worry about them wanting revenge, or hurting other people.  Cathy doesn't like killing, but all she has to do is let me handle it.  I can protect us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald's heart sunk when listening to Nightprowl's cold reply. An emotionless, calculating response that went against everything that a hero stood for.  He put that thought aside and replied to her first comment.  &quot;Cathy's sleeping right now, and I'm with her. She's safe and you'll be together again before she wakes up.  So, can we talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't seem to have much of a choice, do I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.  I just want you to understand everything before you go back to her again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand just fine. You betrayed me. Now get lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nightprowl, the bus won't be coming for you.  It already left.  The only way you're getting out of this place and back to Cathy is by me taking you back, and I'm not going to do that until I have some assurance that you won't start hurting and killing people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For a smart guy you sure can be stupid.  Who do you think saved you when Samuel Roeper was torturing you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did, and I'm grateful...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, NO!&quot; Nightprowl interrupted.  She thought for a moment, then a smile drew across her face.  &quot;You had no intention of coming back for me, did you?  The way you trussed me up was overkill, plain and simple.  I might've worked my way free from one of those bars, but two bars would've held me for a long time.  You wrapped five bars around me, plus another two on my legs.  The one around my neck was just more insult.  You wanted to make sure I never got loose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a mental trap.  You could've gotten out of it any time you wanted, but I needed you to feel like you couldn't escape from it.  I just didn't want you running loose until I came back for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LIAR!&quot; Nightprowl yelled, but quickly calmed herself.  &quot;Cathy made you come back for me, didn't she?  Did she even know I was gone, or did you use your metal voodoo on her to hide me away?  She found out what you did and told you to release me, didn't she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nightprowl, I just need you to assure me that you'll behave, then I can take you out of this place.  You want to get out of this place, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl grinned at Gerald's response.  &quot;I'm right.  Cathy told you you had no business messing around in our mind and to put things back, so you have to release me.&quot;  Nightprowl's eyes narrowed and in a defiant tone she continued.  &quot;No.  I won't promise you anything.  In fact, if I get my way we probably will kill again.  It's the only thing those villains know and fear - the threat of pain and death.  And I'll probably enjoy it, too; I know I did the first time.  Now the ball's in your court, Gerry-boy.  Do you go back to Cathy without me and risk her never forgiving you, or do you go back with me and risk a loose cannon running rampant in Paragon City?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald was silent, trying to figure out how to salvage this conversation, to try and get some sort of assurance, for what it was worth.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl saw her edge and pressed her advantage. &quot;You have to take me back, no matter how evil you think I am. Am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would just like...&quot; Gerald began, but was quickly cut off<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes or no?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nightprowl...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl began to fume.  &quot;Answer my question right now, dammit! 'YES OR NO?' And if you start your answer with anything other than one of those two words, I'll beat you into a bloody pulp!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald gritted his teeth, then answered her.  &quot;Yes.  I have to take you back, no matter how evil I think you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl shook her head in disgust.  She looked at Gerald and asked him &quot;Have you figured out who saved you from Roeper yet?&quot;  She could only take a few seconds of his blank stare before she answered him.  &quot;<b>We</b> did, you ignorant bastard.  Me and Cathy.  We're one person, we just have a different way of thinking.  If <b>we</b> kill someone, it's because <b>we</b> decided someone needed to be killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald finally began to understand this Nightprowl persona in front of him. &quot;Your real name isn't Nightprowl, is it?  What's your real name&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
She looked at him as though he'd sprouted a second head before answering. &quot;My real name's Cathy Watts, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that answer came his confirmation.  She wasn't a separate entity, an alter ego triggered by the killing of Dr. Stevenson.  She had always been part of the mind that made up the person he knew as Cathy Watts, and that was why Cathy was acting so differently since the explosion - Gerald had locked part of Cathy away inside her own mind.  This mutation had always been there, but he couldn't ignore that the killing of Dr. Stevenson made this part of her mind more violent, more aggressive.  He wanted some sort of assurance that this part of Cathy's mind wouldn't overwhelm her, forcing her to commit evil acts.  He only knew of one thing this persona wanted, so he used it.  &quot;What would it take to get you to promise me that you won't kill any more?  Do you remember what you whispered in my ear?&quot;<br />
<br />
For the first time Nightprowl laughed, remembering the sexual advance she'd whispered in Gerald's ear before he turned on her, imprisoning her.  &quot;I was just trying to get a rise out of you Gerry.  Just like Cathy wasn't herself, I wasn't entirely myself then either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren't yourself, but those desires weren't fabricated. I'll do it.  I'll do it, but only if you promise me you'll stop killing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl looked over at Gerry, trying to decide if this was a test. &quot;You're serious?  Wait... you locked me up here and left me to rot!  After doing what you did to me, satisfying some of my desires is the least you owe me.&quot;  She paused before adding &quot;But I'll try, for Cathy's sake, not yours. That's the best I can offer.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<br />
***5***<br />
<br />
<br />
Cathy awoke from her sleep immediately, her head filling with the release of the memories and emotions that Gerald had locked away.  Furious anger washed through her body, an anger which she'd never before experienced and which she was finding difficult to control.  She looked off to her left and found Gerald sitting on a chair, staring at her with a concerned look on his face.  It was the last face Cathy wanted to see at the moment.<br />
<br />
Cathy flung the bed sheets off of her and spun into a sitting position, her back to Gerald.  <i>'Don't say a word, Gerry.  Don't say a damn word'</i> she thought to herself, knowing that she wouldn't be able to talk to him without screaming and yelling.  She got out of bed and walked out to the hallway, a simple glare kept Gerald from asking her anything.  She opened the linen closet and got out a pillow and blanket, then walked back into her room.  She handed the items to Gerald and with a cold voice said &quot;You're sleeping on the couch.  And I don't want to hear a damn word from your mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald didn't say anything; he just slunk off to the living room to prepare his bed for the night, and for many nights down the road.  It was about a half-hour later while he was still staring at the ceiling, wondering what animal he'd unleashed in Cathy, when he heard something from the bedroom. <i>'Cathy's getting up to go to the bathroom'</i> he first thought, but then he heard a closet opening and more noise.  He got off the couch and cautiously walked down the hallway towards the bedroom before realizing the noise was coming from the room Cathy kept her Nightprowl things.  He opened the door to find Cathy putting the finishing touches on getting dressed in her Nightprowl costume.<br />
<br />
Before he could say anything she spoke up in a cold voice.  &quot;I can't sleep.  I'll be back in a few hours.&quot;  Gerald was torn as to how to respond.  He wanted to argue that she shouldn't go out in her state of mind, but he was on thin ice already and didn't want to lose her.  He knew she could take care of herself, but he was afraid of what she would do to the unlucky criminal who tried to break the law in her presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy, you shouldn't go out in your condition.&quot;  He placed his hand on her shoulder, trying to connect with her, show her that he cared about her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't touch me!&quot; she yelled, shrugging off his hand and outstretching her arm, pushing Gerald in the chest and setting him off balance.  Gerald was surprised at what Cathy had just done and couldn't catch himself in time; he fell to the ground, sitting on the floor with the look of shock on his face.  <br />
<br />
Cathy went pale and her mouth dropped open when she'd realized what she'd just done.  She regained her composure and in a softer voice said &quot;Just... leave me alone right now, please.  I need to think.&quot;  She opened the window and stepped out onto the ledge, leaving  Gerald sitting on the floor.<br />
<br />
She lept up to the rooftop of her building, cursing what had just happened. <i>'He could've caught himself before he fell down'</i> Cathy tried to convince herself, though she knew that wasn't the point; she'd proven to him that she was having trouble controlling the new emotions she was feeling.  <i>'The doctor was wrong.  I can be who I want to be, I'm not an assassin.  I'm a hero.'</i>  The thought of the doctor's words angered Cathy, and before she could push the thought away she wished he was there with her right then, just so she could kill him again.  <i>'I'm not an assassin, I'm a hero'</i> she repeated to herself, not sure if it was a statement or a wish.<br />
<br />
<br />
***6***<br />
<br />
<br />
For the next few days Cathy struggled with her emotions, thought her mood lightened as she slowly began to understand and control them. Snide comments and dirty looks that days ago would've burst through into the open now remained in her mind without showing themselves. It was after she'd come to terms with her new emotions that Cathy finally got around to sorting through the box of things that were brought home from the hospital.  She pulled out the costume she was wearing in the explosion and shook her head at the damage it had taken.  The mask was shattered, the back was blackened, and there was a small cut near the ankle.  Cathy guessed that the doctors must have tried to cut the costume off her, but stopped when they realized how strong the material was.  In the box she then noticed an envelope with &quot;Cat&quot; written on it.  It was in Trish's handwriting.  <i>'This must be the letter from Trish that Boxcar gave to me'</i> she thought.<br />
<br />
Cathy thought back to the day she awoke, wondering had she been a 'complete' person, had Gerald not locked away part of her mind, would she have treated that Trish differently?  She missed Trish badly, and wondered if the duplicate was 'close enough' to her Trish.  She put that aside as just wanting Trish not to be dead.  She opened the letter, expecting something far different than what she found.  It read:<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Dear Cat:<br />
<br />
Screw you.  Screw you and the high horse you rode in on.  Don't you think there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder who I am... what I am?  Every day I wonder whether I have a soul, or whether it went to Heaven with my body in the morgue. I've been told that I can't go back to my family because they think I died long ago, and I might put them in danger if they know that I'm a hero.  You're all that I had left and you turned me away.  Why did you even bother saving me?<br />
<br />
I've decided it would be best if I went back to Canada for the time being, to recuperate and regain my strength.  My handlers have arranged for a flight out of Paragon City, and by the time you read this I should be on my way home.  What you said hurt me more than words can describe.  It hurt me more than anything Joseph Stevenson was able to do to me.  I don't know what I am, but I know I'm a real person, with real emotions.  I thought that of all the people in the world, you would be the one to understand that.  I changed, I admit that.  I'm not the same person you knew years ago.  But you changed once too.  When you mutated, when you grew your tail I thought no less of you.  The roles have been reversed and I now find myself alone.<br />
<br />
I tried to survive as best I could, and this fake shell is all that's left of me.  I'm sorry for leaving you.  I'm sorry for dying on you.  I may no longer be your Trish, but you'll always be my Cathy.  That's a promise I made to you a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Your friend forever,<br />
Trish<br />
<br />
P.S.:  Though I have little doubt you don't want to see me, please don't try to contact me.  I don't have the emotional strength to survive seeing you again.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
It was at that moment when Cathy realized what a horrible, horrible mistake she'd made. She'd pushed Trish away because she had changed, but now Cathy knew that in her heart she was the same person Cathy grew up with.  She had pushed Trish away and now Trish didn't want to talk to her, leaving her with no way to apologize; no way to tell her how sorry she was for hurting her.<br />
<br />
Cathy then thought of Gerald.  She'd been furious with him ever since she found out what he did to her mind and she still resented him for it, but she couldn't keep punishing him forever. The fear came to her that he might suddenly say he's had enough and leave her; she couldn't let that happen. In hindsight, with these new, aggressive emotions in her mind maybe <i>something</i> did have to be done while she was in her coma. It didn't excuse Gerald for acting without her consent and not telling her the minute she was better, but his actions were understandable. <br />
<br />
She had to make things right.  She had to make things right with Trish, and at least give Gerald some sign that she wouldn't be angry with him forever.  The wheels in her mind began to turn, and within seconds she'd decided how to win Gerald back, but finding Trish would be much harder.  She had no connections in the Canadian government, and Trish would surely be hidden away somewhere in a government facility.  She then remembered a picture Charles had on the wall of his office; a picture of himself and Cynthia along with former Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney and his wife Mila, smiling cheerfully for the camera. <i>'Of course'</i> she thought to herself.  <i>'Charles deals with governments all over the world.  He might know someone who could help.'</i><br />
<br />
With Charles working on finding Trish, Cathy then put away the pillow and blanket Gerald was using to sleep on the couch and returned to her daily routine.  That night when Gerald asked where his blanket and pillow were, Cathy just gave him a stern look. &quot;Oh.&quot; Gerald had replied, thinking that she didn't feel like answering him, but when her look changed he realized what she meant.  &quot;Oh!&quot; he replied with a smile, thankful that he was off the couch and back into the bedroom.  &quot;I'm still mad at you&quot; she said.  They slept in the bed together, but not once did they come close to touching; Gerald was still in the doghouse and he wasn't about to press his luck.<br />
<br />
It took Charles three days and several favours, but he was able to get one small piece of information - a phone number.  He presented it to Cathy, but warned her &quot;Unless you know the passcode and are on a secure line, they won't admit to being anything other than a dry cleaning business.  Just start talking, ignore what the person on the other end says, and say what you need to say.  Someone will go over the recording of the call and <i>maybe</i> your friend will be told, or find out about it.  That's the best I could do Cathy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cathy smiled and kissed him on the cheek, in Charles' mind making the reward well worth the effort, and replied &quot;You did great, Charles.  Thank you.  I owe you one&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***7***<br />
<br />
<br />
She sat by her phone for over a half an hour, trying to decide what you say and never seeming to get the words right.  Finally she just picked up the phone and quickly dialed before she could back out.  Her heart skipped a beat when it started ringing, and her mind went blank when someone picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lou's Drycleaning.  How may I help you?&quot; asked a feminine voice.<br />
<br />
After a second Cathy cleared her throat and replied.  &quot;Hi.. uhm, I'm looking for Trish.  Trish Jackson.  I'm a friend of hers&quot; she said, but even as she spoke it her mind corrected her <i>'You <b>were</b> a friend of hers - then you stabbed her in the back.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, you must have the wrong number.  There's nobody here by that name&quot; answered the woman<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Cathy Watts.  I'm calling from Paragon City.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your name's Cathy Watts and you're calling from Paragon City?  And you're looking for a person named Trish Jackson?&quot; she repeated casually, though Cathy could imagine someone beside the woman's desk interested in the specifics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  Listen, I know you can't tell me anything other than you're a dry cleaning business and nobody named Trish or anybody else for that matter works there, and I understand that, but I just wanted to tell her that I'm sorry for what I said to her.  I was wrong.  I just wanted her to know... to know that I know I was wrong for what I said to her and what I did to her.&quot;  Everything Cathy wanted to explain and say was rolling through her mind and she couldn't pick a place to start.  &quot;Just tell her I'm sorry, and I was wrong&quot; she ended, hoping it would be enough, at least for now.<br />
<br />
The voice on the other end seemed unsure of how to respond, and after a few moments of consideration replied &quot;I'm sorry, there's nobody here by that name... but I'll ask Lou if he knows anyone by that name, and if so I'll ask him to pass on the message.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank you, thank you!&quot; Cathy replied.  &quot;Well, goodbye then, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hung up the phone and her good mood lasted just over two hours, until she answered a knock on her door.  She opened the door to find two men in dark sunglasses, suits, and ties.  &quot;May we come in, Miss Watts?&quot;  For a moment Cathy thought these were the same two who talked to her in the hospital, but after a quick look she knew she hadn't seen these two before; they were dressed like the two from the hospital, but one had a square jaw, an athletic type, while the other was heavier and had a very short neck.  &quot;Sure&quot; she said, opening the door fully for her guests.<br />
<br />
Cathy started the conversation off as innocently and politely as she could.  &quot;I was hoping that my friend got the message I sent.  It was a simple apology, surely there isn't any sort of security risk in that, is there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Square Jaw replied &quot;I'm sorry ma'am, but policy prevents us from forwarding any information we receive.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cathy's eyes narrowed. <i>'I'm a &quot;ma'am&quot; now?'</i> In a lighter tone she replied &quot;So if my friend didn't get my message, then why are you two here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma'am, I'll be blunt.  We'd like to know where you got our phone number.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'There's that &quot;ma'am&quot; again.'</i> &quot;Call me Cathy... or Nightprowl&quot; she said, making sure they knew who they were dealing with.  &quot;My sources are my own, and might I remind you that we're both on the same side here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Watts, as part of a <i>secret</i> government agency, it disturbs us when a woman phones us out of the blue, knowing things about us that she shouldn't know.  If your boyfriend helped you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You leave Gerry out of this!&quot; Cathy angrily replied. &quot;He's got nothing to do with it and if I find out you even approached him to question him about this, I'll make sure you'll become the most <b>public</b> secret government agency in the world!&quot;<br />
<br />
The second man spoke up, trying to calm the situation, but he only managed to anger Cathy further.  &quot;Ma'am...&quot; he started, but Cathy gave him a cutting glare with her icy blue eyes and growled &quot;I swear, if either of you call me &quot;ma'am&quot; one more time I'm going to shove my fist down your throat.&quot;  Both men were taken aback by Cathy's threat; her posture, tone, and icy glare told them she meant every word. The thought of subjecting these two men to various acts of violence tumbled through Cathy's mind, a strangely satisfying act of imagination that she knew she couldn't act out.<br />
<br />
After a few awkward seconds, Cathy broke the silence with a cold and monotone statement.  &quot;This was a one-time thing; I needed to send a message to my friend and this was the only way I knew to try and contact her.  I'm no threat to your agency now, and won't be unless I find more of you guys knocking on my door. I think you'd better leave now.&quot;  Cathy opened the door wide and stared at the two men who'd not yet made a move towards the door. A short standoff ensued but the men knew they would get no further, and exited the apartment.  As they were leaving Square Jaw took a verbal jab at Cathy.  &quot;For a hero, your actions today aren't very heroic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bite me, G-man&quot; Cathy shot back.  &quot;If you ever decide to take that stick out of your rear end and give Trish my message, I'd like that very much.  Goodbye.&quot; She didn't wait for an answer before slamming the door shut.  She was fuming when she picked up the phone and dialed 'Lou's Drycleaning' once more, ready to give them an earful.  Her anger was cut down with the automated voice that answered.  &quot;The number you have reached is not in service.  Please check the number and dial again&quot;.  Cathy couldn't believe it; they'd disconnected the number just because she'd phoned them.<br />
<br />
Cathy was frustrated and angry all afternoon and into the evening, working herself up over the fact that they'd come to her home to ask her about the number Charles had given her.  She wondered what kind of strings Charles had to pull to get it, and whether he would end up in trouble for helping her.  She highly doubted that Trish would get the message, putting her back to square one with regards to apologizing to Trish.  Her thoughts then wandered back to Gerald.  She couldn't do anything about Trish, but she could be nicer to Gerry.<br />
<br />
She cooked for them that night and they actually had a bit of a normal conversation, almost like they would have had before the explosion, before the hospital, and before Gerry invaded Cathy's mind and locked part of it away.  That knowledge prevented either of them from relaxing during dinner, and that evening they slipped back into an awkward silence.  Cathy went on an late night patrol, getting home after 3am, and as she was preparing for bed she couldn't help but stare at Gerald sleeping peacefully in her bed.  In their bed.  She slipped under the covers and placed her hand on Gerald's chest, feeling the warmth of his body and the beating of his heart, and wanting everything to be right between them.<br />
<br />
Cathy awoke to the smell of bacon, eggs, and hash browns.  She remembered cuddling up to Gerald's shoulder in the middle of the night and enjoying the warmth of his body.  She wanted to forgive him, and she just wanted to be happy; she was tired of not feeling happy because she felt the need to punish Gerald for what he had done, and she was tired of not feeling happy because she was being punished by Trish. <br />
<br />
As she laid in bed she thought to herself <i>'Maybe I've punished him enough. While his actions were totally misguided, he was trying to do the right thing at the time.'</i>  It was time to let Gerald off the hook, and have some fun while she was at it.  Cathy slipped out of bed and wrapped herself in a bath towel, then snuck into the kitchen.  His back was to her, but the sound of the fridge door opening alerted Gerald that she was there.  &quot;I'm making breakfast&quot; he said over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
She reached into the fridge and grabbed a jar of maraschino cherries and a can of whipped cream.  She turned around and with a quick tug dropped her towel to the floor.  Gerald was still working the hash browns when Cathy crept up to him and whispered in his ear &quot;I want something else for breakfast, Big Boy&quot;.  He turned to look at her nakedness and his eyes widened.  &quot;Your wish is my command&quot; he replied with a smile, and after quickly turning off the stove he kissed her deeply.<br />
<br />
As Cathy was still recovering from the kiss, Gerald bent over and hoisted her up over his shoulder. Cathy squealed in surprise, then laughed.  When Gerald went to the fridge Cathy tried to look around to see what he was doing. &quot;Come on Gerry!  To the bedroom!&quot; she urged.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a jar of chocolate sauce in the back&quot; he replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes! Good call.  Chocolate sauce first, then to the bedroom!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***8***<br />
<br />
<br />
Gerald saw Cathy change for the better over the next few weeks; she seemed happier and she even started to take up yoga, sometimes sitting for hours, bending, stretching, and centering her mind.  She seemed focused, in control of the urges that Gerald had first feared would overcome her.  Gerald was glad to be wrong, glad that Cathy was able to control her impulses.  It was one night while Cathy and Gerald were lying in bed when Gerald suddenly spoke up, telling Cathy about an important piece of information he'd received earlier in the day.  &quot;She's back in Paragon City, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Northern Shock.&quot;  Gerald could see Cathy considering what he'd just said, thoughts weighing heavily on her shoulders.  &quot;Do you want to talk to her?  I can make some calls, arrange a meeting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already got in trouble once because of a phone call. Besides, she didn't want me to contact her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room went silent, and Cathy closed her eyes and curled up beside him to sleep.  Gerald thought for a minute, then spoke again.  &quot;I checked with her handlers.  She'll be patrolling Crey's Folley tomorrow.&quot;  Gerald wondered if she'd heard him; she made no attempt to acknowledge his statement.  He stroked his hand lightly through her hair then closed his eyes, and soon after drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
It was shortly after noon the next day when Nightprowl found herself perched atop a water tower in Crey's Folley.  None of the villains were a match for her, but today she wasn't patrolling for villains; she was patrolling for a hero.  She was looking for Northern Shock's costume when a flash of red and white caught her eye.  It wasn't her old costume, but after a good look Cathy was certain it was Trish.<br />
<br />
She almost yelled Trish's name before remembering that she still had a secret identity to protect.  &quot;Shock!&quot;  she called out, waving her hands to attract her attention.  &quot;Northern Shock!&quot;  The red and white clad figure looked in Nightprowl's direction then eased up from her flight path.  She looked back in the direction she was travelling, as if to consider not stopping, but then altered her course and flew towards the water tower on which Nightprowl was perched.<br />
<br />
She approached, eased up, and landed lightly.  &quot;Nightprowl&quot; she said in a low tone, a professional greeting between heroes.<br />
<br />
It was then when Cathy realized she didn't know what to say. She'd spent the morning searching for Northern Shock and never even thought of what she was going to tell her when they met.  &quot;You have a new costume.  It looks nice.  I like the lightning effect up the arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... thanks.&quot;  She looked back where she'd been flying, then mentioned &quot;I'm on patrol right now&quot;, a not too subtle hint that she was uncomfortable talking to Cathy.<br />
<br />
Cathy tried to think of something to say to get her to stay. &quot;I just wanted to ask you if you read my report about the incident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fiction.  You lied in it&quot; she said in a stern voice.<br />
<br />
Cathy was taken aback by the blunt statement. &quot;Huh, what are you talking about?  Why would I lie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know Cat, why don't you tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked away with a pout and raised her chin. She looked back at Trish and said &quot;You're just guessing.  You don't know what happened.  You were unconscious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish frowned, knowing she'd caught Cathy in a lie. &quot;Yes, but I know you lied about what happened between you and the doctor.  When you always had a habit of trying to put even the most irrelevant pieces of information into your school work, and I've seen some of the same writing in your hero reports.  You wrote every little detail about our conversation and fight in the morgue, but the confrontation between you and Dr. Stevenson is surprisingly devoid of information.  He didn't really attack you, forcing you to defend yourself with lethal force, did he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked away again, unable to meet Trish's stare. &quot;So, are you going to tell on me or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Trish replied coldly.  &quot;It doesn't matter, because I don't think he's dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy flashed back to the look Dr. Stevenson had given her as she'd ended his life.  No fear, no anger, just a look that told her she'd done exactly what he'd expected her to do. It made Cathy wonder why he'd sacrifice himself just to awaken a part of Cathy's mind that had lied dormant. The part of her mind she now calmed with hours of meditation.  &quot;I killed him, I'm sure of that.  I felt his neck snap.&quot;  Cathy paused before offering her speculation.  &quot;But I agree that I didn't kill the real Dr. Stevenson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish's mind jumped to Cathy's conclusion. &quot;He was a duplicate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy nodded, and from her costume she pulled out a picture.  &quot;See this?  It's a picture of the doctor.  He looks the same, right?&quot;  Trish nodded.  &quot;The woman in the picture is my biological mother.  It was taken over thirty years ago.&quot;  Cathy continued her conclusion.  &quot;Visually you seem a bit younger than what you should be, and I think the person we knew as Dr. Stevenson was created in the same manner; artificially aged to a certain point of the creator's choosing.  The real Dr. Stevenson would have to be in his mid-eighties now, if he's even still alive today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's over eighty? That can't be.&quot;  Trish replied.  &quot;I thought he just made a duplicate of himself to fake his own death. Wow.  This changes things.&quot;  Trish now stared out over the Crey Folley landscape, pondering all that had happened since the Rikti War.  &quot;All this time, I was being tortured and experimented on by a duplicate.&quot;  She shook her head at the thought.  &quot;So, it's over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure.  Maybe we'll never know.  You're free of him now, and even if the real Dr. Stevenson <b>is</b> behind this, I don't think he can come to Paragon City - he's still wanted for a massacre that happened thirty years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish looked out into the distance, her mind far away in thought.  After coming to terms with what had happened, and what would be her future, she turned to Cathy.  &quot;How did you get here, Cat?  I never thought you'd become a hero.  It's been what, about two years, and so much has changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy and Trish sat down on the water tower and Cathy began to talk, telling her stories of what happened since the Rikti War.  Cathy told Trish about her funeral, about finding out that she was Northern Shock, being abducted by Samuel Roeper, and getting wisked away to Belize by Charles Monroe.  She told Trish about her connection with Joseph Stevenson, and how she was the result of a genetic breeding experiment done by him years ago, only to be saved from a life of captivity and experimentation by her biological mother.<br />
<br />
Trish didn't volunteer much information about after the War; while hiding behind her Northern Shock persona she simply recited what she'd told investigators about her last day during the War; getting ambushed by Rikti, retreating with the whole team suffering severe wounds, including two fatalities, then being captured by a Crey 'salvage' team (of course Crey Industries denied the existence of this type of 'salvage' operation).  The time in captivity was whittled down to &quot;I was tortured, abused, subjected to experimentation, and killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
In her new body she'd decided to try another tactic to escape.  Pretend to be co-operative, using the bomb implanted in her body as a the reason she was suddenly as obedient as she was previously combative, and wait for them to let down their guard so she could escape.  She'd already been clever enough to sneak away parts to create a signal jammer that she hoped would prevent the bomb from being activated before it could be removed, but they never let their guard down and Trish never got the chance to escape.  Trish the changed the subject by putting Cathy on the defensive. &quot;I've been reading some of your other reports too.  You seem to be a favourite target of that lawyer, Chris Aiken or something.  He's got several clients claiming you use excessive force.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris Jenkins.  He's an ambulance chaser.  He thinks if he can get enough scum saying the same thing, a judge might believe it.  My arrests are good.  If they get a bloody nose while they're being arrested, it's because they deserved it.&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a lull in the conversation, and Northern Shock leaned forward as if to raise up to her feet.  Cathy panicked for a second and blurted out &quot;So, you're here for good then?&quot;, trying to keep the conversation going.<br />
<br />
Northern Shock rocked back into a reclined position.  &quot;For the near future, yeah&quot; she replied, then after a short pause decided to elaborate.  &quot;I'm testing an experiment.  I think that's why my handlers were so accepting of me coming back from the dead - it gave them a test subject to experiment on without worrying about nasty consequences, like having to explain a test subject's death to her family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Die?  Tr..&quot; Cathy began to say 'Trish' but remembered she still had a secret identity to protect.  &quot;Shock, why would you volunteer for something like that?  If it's because of what I said...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she replied. &quot;I signed the release a long time ago when I first got my powers.  I looked over the specs first though, and it seems sound.  Signed release or not, I wouldn't have undergone the experiment if I thought it would kill me.  Despite what you think I don't have a death wish, Cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy took the little jab without argument.  &quot;So, then what's so special about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not supposed to...&quot; Trish started, but saw the look Cathy was giving her.  She remembered that look years ago whenever she'd mention an interesting school science experiment she was doing, and Cathy would ask for her to tell her more even though usually afterwards Cathy would reply <i>'I have no clue what you just said, but you're working on it so I'm sure it'll be a big success!'</i><br />
<br />
With a small grin at her past memories, she replied in a way Cathy could understand. &quot;I have millions of tiny bio-engineered cells in my bloodstream which are able to store some of the electricity I generate, and they're able to sense when I'm hurt.  When I'm in danger, they release the stored electricity, allowing me to unleash much more potent attacks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems useful here&quot; Cathy said. She didn't want the conversation to end, so she asked the first question that came to her mind. &quot;So you're not in danger of being electrocuted or anything?&quot; Immediately she found herself thinking <i>'Duh!  Of course she won't be electrocuted!  She can shoot streams of electricity from her hands without being electrocuted!'</i><br />
<br />
Trish was more forgiving of Cathy's question. &quot;No, my body's able to harness all of the extra power.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that they found themselves at an awkward moment.  Both were sitting, looking at each other, not sure of what to say to elevate the conversation past the first level, and not sure how the other felt about their relationship.  Trish raised to her feet and casually commented &quot;I've got to go, I'm supposed to be patrolling...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy quickly cut her off.  &quot;I miss you&quot;  she blurted out, letting her heart take control of the conversation. She rose from the ground and looked at Trish with pleading eyes. The next seconds of silence where terrifying.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you miss <i>her</i>&quot; Trish finally replied with a tinge of hurt in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss <b><i>you</i></b>&quot; Cathy repeated, her voice quivering with emotion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did you hurt me, Cat?  You hurt me worse than I ever thought possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.  I'm sorry. It's just that it was hard for me to say goodbye to you two years ago, then when I got a sliver of hope that you might be alive I wanted so badly for it to be true.  When I saw your body in the morgue I was crushed; I felt even worse than at your funeral.  I didn't know how to respond, so I shut my emotions down to avoid the pain.  I made a decision that you were dead so I couldn't be hurt again.  I just couldn't handle it.  I was wrong, and I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish considered Cathy's words, but her face didn't give Cathy a clue as to what would be her decision.  Would she forgive Cathy, or would she just walk away?  Cathy remembered their promise; to be 'friends forever', and how she'd broken that promise in the research facility.  Trish wrote that she'd still be Cathy's friend, but that was over a month ago and she'd yet to even try to contact Cathy.  Maybe it was just Trish's way of saying goodbye, like one would say 'I'll call you sometime' or 'see you later' without really meaning it.  Cathy couldn't let their friendship end this way. &quot;I'll never forgive myself for the way I treated you, but I hope this will be a good start...&quot; she said, then reached into a pocket on her costume.  As Cathy drew out the piece of jewelry, Trish saw the silver bracelet with the small cat hanging from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks just like my old bracelet.  You didn't need to replace it, Cat&quot; she replied, and as she saw Cathy's look, as if waiting for her reaction, Trish took another look at the bracelet.  It was shiny from a good cleaning, but it was worn on the edges and dinged in places from years of use. She looked at the small cat and saw the engraving: 'CTF4E'. <i>'Cathy and Trish, Friends Forever'</i> she thought to herself.  Trish was stunned as she now realized that Cathy hadn't replaced the bracelet lost in the explosion - it <i>was</i> the bracelet she thought she'd lost in the explosion.  &quot;When did you...?&quot;  was all that she could think as she looked at the bracelet that had been a symbol of their friendship for years, a symbol she thought she'd left behind in the research facility.<br />
<br />
&quot;After our fight I said goodbye to you... the old you. At the time I just felt the need to take it; I don't know why. I think I know now though - it was because I was supposed to make sure it got back to you.  You're my best friend, and I wasn't there when you needed me.  I can't change that, but I'm here now, and I'm begging for your forgiveness.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Their eyes locked and they could feel the connection between them, a bond formed through decades of friendship.  Trish opened her arm, inviting Cathy close, and Cathy wrapped her arms around her new old friend, holding her tight and whispering in her ear.  &quot;I'm so sorry.  I was so mean.  You <i>are</i> my Trish.&quot;  Trish wrapped her arms around Cathy and rested her chin on her shoulder.  They both held each other and wept, two friends trying to come to terms with their friendship and their past.  &quot;I'm so sorry&quot; Cathy repeated.  &quot;I messed up bad.  If you'll let me, I'd like to be your friend once more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish smiled compassionately, a smile that warmed Cathy heart.  &quot;Are we good?&quot; Cathy asked, hoping Trish would forgive her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're good&quot; Trish replied with a nod.  &quot;I'm going to need another lifetime membership to The Nightprowler though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy laughed.  &quot;Done.  I'll even make it a 'Forever Membership', just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
They smiled at each other and hugged again, both happy that they had begun to mend their friendship.  Trish looked at Cathy and in a sisterly voice said  &quot;So, you and Gerry...&quot;, resuming her role as Cathy's best friend by inquiring about her love life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Me and Gerry&quot; Cathy replied with a smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>***END***<br />
<br />
And they all lived happily ever after.  So what if Cathy's got a few homicidal urges, and we still have no idea what happened to the real Dr. Stevenson?  Okay, I guess I could do something about that in the next episode.</i></div>
