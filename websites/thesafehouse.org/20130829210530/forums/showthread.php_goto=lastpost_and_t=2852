 <i><b>Submitted by Gholam</b> <br />
 Additional comments added from Greyknight, Ueuelyan and other Safehouse Rogues <br />

  <br />
 <b>General Description</b> <br />
 The Plane of Hate is only accessed via wizard-only Alter Plane: Hate spell. Each cast of the spell uses up a reagent called Fuligant Soulstone of Innoruuk. The stone is sold by a vendor in the dark elf clerics guild, in Neriak 3rd Gate. Minimum price for it is 210pp. Rogue can sneak there and buy it while being KOS to DEs - just don't forget to refresh hide (and hide only - do not deactivate sneak) after shopping. Although button stays grey while you shop, your hiding is broken. Level limit on the portal is 46 - if you are 45 or less, you will be left behind.  <br />
   <br />
 A good map of Plane of Hate is located at <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/maps/PoH-MASTER.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/maps/PoH-MASTER.jpg</a> - I recommend that you print it out before heading up to Hate. The map, however, has a few mistakes. South Patrol Route is actually a circle, and the part of it not shown on the map goes from 7, to between 9 and A, then to between S and T, and then on zone wall back to the point which is shown on map.  <br />
   <br />
 Safest place to pull to is southwest corner - behind house S on the map. No mobs go there on their own.  <br />
   <br />
 <b>Listing of Creatures and Loot</b> <br />
 <b>Spite Golem</b> - Shaman, casts SOW and alacrity on nearby mobs, has a pet. Drops Runed Etched armor (shaman), a Runewood Shield (druid) or a shaman shield. I, personally, have never seen one of those shields. Scowls at a sneaking rogue, but does not see them. 100% spell resistant to all but poison/disease based spells.  <br />
 <b>Scorn Banshee</b> - Warrior, drops Imbrued Platemail Armor (bard) and occasionally Martune Rapier (8/23 +5 str +4 agi if I remember correctly, bard only). Warning: Cons indifferent, but DOES SEE sneaking rogues. Undead (female zombie). Do strong disease.  <br />
 <b>Forsaken Revenants</b> - Male ones are magicians and drop Apothic armor (magician), females ones are enchanters and drop Insidious armor (enchanters). Female revenants don't charm. Posess annoying damage shields, male ones also cast nasty AE spells. Have pets. Do not see rogues. Undead (vampires).  <br />
 <b>Abhorrents</b> - Rogues (backstab), drop Woven Shadow armor (rogue) and occasionally a Shrieking Ahlspiess (9/27, +4 str +5 dex, proc Yaulp II - +8 AC +20 STR for 18 seconds. Rogue only. Renders as short spear although icon is that of a dirk). Do not go invisible or see rogues. Very low magic resists - enchanters favorite target for charming. Gargoyle look.  <br />
 <b>Clerics of Innoruuk</b> - Clerics... oh god, how do I hate these things... they don't have a whole lot of HP at first glance, but they cast complete heals very fast - especially at each other, and interrupting them is very difficult. More than 3 of them - consider entire force dead (unless you have 50+ people). Drop Ethereal Mist armor (that purple cleric stuff) and Prismatic Shields (AC18 +10 SV all, cleric only). Do not see rogues. Look like dark elven guards.  <br />
 <b>Kiraikueis</b> - Monks, drop Indicolite (warrior armor) and Shurikens of the Tranquil (monk-only throwing weapons). Do not see rogues. Undead (mummies). Do strong disease.  <br />
 <b>Ire Ghasts</b> - Shadowknights (multiple harm touch), drop Theologian Claymore (paladin 2HS), Darkmetal Holy Water Sprinkler (paladin 1HB) and Trueheart Shield (paladin shield). Undead, ghouls. Do not see rogues.  <br />
 <b>Revultant Rats</b> - Warriors, drop Revultant Whip (ranger-only whip, 5/14 and some stats), do deadly poison. Do not see rogues. Giant diseased rats.  <br />
 <b>Ashenbone Drakes</b> - Necromancers, drop Ashenbone Axe (24/42 2HS with some stats, war/pal/sk/rng), Ashenbone Abassi (9/25 5str 4agi SK only) and Ashenbone Shield (AC25 +5 STA +100 HP, SK only). Do not see rogues. Undead, miniature versions of Dracoliche (dragon skeleton). To me, they resemble winged kangaroo skeletons, especially when they attack.  <br />
 <b>Loathling Liches</b> - Wizards, see sneaking rogues, usually  drop nothing but sometimes a rod of souls - 3 charges drain souls. Undead, spectres.  <br />
 <b>Maestro of Rancor</b> - Warrior, casts an AE lifetap (small radius though, only catches melees), hits pretty hard and damn fast. List of drops:  <br />
  	Six Note Blade - 11/25 1HS, bard only.  <br />
  	Evensong - 11/25 1HB, bard only.  <br />
  	Kelin's Seven Stringed Lute - bard string instrument.  <br />
  	Shield of the Stalwart Seas - AC35 +20 STR +20 STA, effect Ultravision (permanent while worn) shield. Only usable by Erudite Paladins (meant for Deepwater Knights judging by name, but they couldn't restrict Peacekeepers from using it as well).  <br />
  	Mempo of Likato - monk-only mask, effect of Ultravision. No other stats.  <br />
  	A monk shoulderpiece - I forgot name, as well as stats, but it's pretty damn nice. Not to be confused with Rakusha Cloak - that one comes off Innoruuk.  <br />
  	Basoon Haste Gauntlets NO LONGER DROP, although spoiler sites list them as coming off the Maestro.  <br />
 <b>Innoruuk</b> - Death touches, does Gravity Flux. List of drops:  <br />
  	Tunarian Scimitar - 8/19 +6 WIS +40 mana, druid only.  <br />
  	Dawnchaser - 11/25 piercing (rapier), bard only.  <br />
  	Vexthorne - 9/19 piercing (rapier), rogue only.  <br />
  	Briarzephyr - 9/19 1HS (falchion), ranger only.  <br />
  	Blood Moon - 18/28 1HS +10 STR (scythe), HUM/DE SK only.  <br />
  	Beckon - 30/42 2HS +10 INT (scythe), TRL/OGR SK only.  <br />
  	Sunderfury - 25/36 2HS, effect of Haste (permanent), warrior only.  <br />
  	Gardash - 30/58 +15 WIS 2HB, TRL/OGR shaman only.  <br />
  	Shield of the Immaculate - AC25 +10 STR +25 SV disease, unlimited charges of Cure Disease, paladin only.  <br />
  	Encyclopedia Necrotheurgia - currently the only known focus object for necromancers (holding it while summoning pet makes the pet more powerful).  <br />
  	Diamond Rod - 5 charges of Diamondskin, wizard only, crap item.  <br />
  	Rod of Unbound Thought - 5 charges of clarity, wizard only, see above.  <br />
   <br />
 All items that drop in Plane of Hate are NO DROP.  <br />
   <br />
 Respawn rate on Innoruuk is 5 days. Respawn rate on Maestro of Rancor and other static mobs (the ones that spawn in houses) is approximately 12-14 hours. Respawn rate on the wandering mobs is 45 minutes. Wandering mobs have a much lower percentage of armor drops than static mobs, thus, it is important to squeeze as many static mob pulls in the window between wanderers clearing and respawn, as possible.  <br />
   <br />
 <b>The Rogue's Role in Hate</b> <br />
   <br />
 Yes boys and girls, we have a defined and unique role in Plane of Hate! As you have noticed from the mob list, Hate has a mix of living and undead mobs - and us, rogues, are the only ones who can be invisible to both at the same time. Thus, our role in Hate is to scout.  <br />
   <br />
 What to scout for.   <br />
   <br />
 Stuck pets. Most mobs in Hate have pets. Those pets tend to get stuck while their master runs around. If you pull the master of a stuck pet, the pet will most likely find its way to you - but it will being every mob it encounters on its way along. Thus, your primary mission is to watch out for stuck pets. <br />
  <br />
 Mob presense/disposition. You are not the puller - monks are. However, it is vital for monks to know what exactly IS around that corner or behind that wall - accurate information about mobs that are up in a house and their placement makes pulling a great deal easier for them.  <br />
 Pulls condition. When one monk has pulled a house out and the second monk is waiting for a single mob to clear so it can be pulled, it is your job to watch over the mobs going back, and inform the monk when the pull is clear. Again, with accurate and complete information pulls can go quickly and efficiently.  <br />
  <br />
 Trains. Unless everything is going 100% alright, do not engage in fighting - there are enough people in camp to kill mobs without you. Always wander around camp, and if you see several mobs running quickly in camp direction, immediately issue a train call - a few seconds advance warning can save everyone's day.  <br />
   <br />
 Mob locations. Southwest corner of map mostly contains Clerics of Innoruuk (houses A, B, C are full of them), as well as some Scorn Banshees, Spite Golems, and the occasionall Kiraikuei. Liches and Revultant Rats exist mostly as wanderers. Southeast corner of map (around portal area) seems to be mostly Ire Ghatsts. Forsaken Revenants and Abhorrents occupy northeast corner of map. Ashenbone Drakes live on the upper level of zone, by Innoruuk (not shown on the map, entered via a ramp in center of zone, marked by 9). Maestro of Rancor sits in the northwest corner of house D, by an organ. He DOES see invis - stay away from him while monks are pulling - but when not aggroed, he always faces the corner, so you can sneak around building as much as you like (provided there are no banshees/liches around).  <br />
   <br />
 <b>Other Tips</b> <br />
   <br />
 Be very, very, very careful. When scouting houses, peek in for a split second, and if you see a banshee/lich, back off immediately - hopefully, it will not aggro.  <br />
 If something does aggro on you, do not run back to camp. Stand and die. You will lose some exp, but you will prevent 30+ other people from losing exp from the resulting train.  <br />
 Mobs do aggro through floors and walls - however, they only do that if you are fighting something behind said wall/floor - a passing by rogue will not cause aggression. In houses C and D, mobs on second floor will not aggro on first floor pulls - but in other, small houses, they will. Houses P and Q cause limited aggression from house D - 2-3 mobs will come, but not the whole place. As the person orchestrating the pulls, keep that in mind.  </div>

------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Hiyas, ya wanna-be sneaky ya!<br />
<br />
So I hear ya wanna know about da Plane of Hate.  Well, ya come to da right spot.  I know da place perty good.  I kin tell ya where what is and how best ta get em.  Course, everybody has der own ways to go, so depends a lot on who yer with, but after spending almost 4 months nonstop in Hate, I think I know it perty good.  Just ask da folks dat know me.<br />
<br />
So here it is, a guide to da Plane of Hate.<br />
<br />
Zyvalla Kwikfingers, Scout of Hate<br />
House Arcanum of BristleBane<br />
<br />
/ooc...<br />
<br />
I'll use the map from Arch Oversees that is all over the net for this tutorial of PoH.  It is an excellent map and even has the houses numbers, so it makes it very easy to reference them.  Also, I made a few corrections based on some info from other players and will correct as others correct me.  Just take this as a guide to scouting because everyone knows a scout HAS to know the area like the back of her hand.<br />
<br />
This is the link for the PoH map I used:<br />
<a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/maps/PoH-MASTER.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/maps/PoH-MASTER.jpg</a><br />
<br />
I broke the Guide into 3 sections... Spawns (mob types and spawn types), Houses (what spawns where), and General (break-in, pulling, general planes rules) because in one big file, it was too big to fit here, or on any other message board for that matter.  It should also make it a bit easier to follow.<br />
<br />
Enjoy, and good luck in there.<br />
<br />

Mobs:<br />
<br />
There are 14 different mobs in Hate, and each is different.<br />
<br />
Cleric of Innoruuk - Cleric - They look like a Dark Elf guard.  They have high magic resist, so harder to mez, and they love to complete heal.  They also buff the mobs they pass with cleric buffs.  Keep them stunned (bash/ slam) while fighting and kill them fast.  They drop cleric gear.  They do not see rogues or even normal invisible.   They have a normal aggro range.<br />
<br />
Ire Ghast - undead Shadow Knight - They look like a ghoul and have low magic resist, so easy to mez, but love to HarmTouch, and do it a lot.  Undead magic works on them.  They drop some Paladin weapons (mace and sword) and a shield, and can also drop the druid shield, though extremely rare.  They do not see rogues, but do see normal player invisible (although invis to undead would work).  They have a small aggro range.<br />
<br />
Revultant Rat - Warrior - They look like a giant diseased rat and have low magic resist, but proc Deadly Poison.  Only drop is a Ranger Whip.  They do not see rogues, but may or may not see normal invis (some do, some don't).  They have a small aggro range.<br />
<br />
Spite Golem - Shaman - They look like a rock golem.  They have insane magic resist (although poison, disease, and the wizard Lure spells will usually stick).  This is the most important target most times.  If you get 2, one warrior, usually the backup assist, will keep second one busy while the group kills number 1.  It is possible to kill several, but very, very tough, so be careful.  They love to cast SoW and other Alacrity on everything close to them.  They drop shaman armor including a shield, and a druid shield.  They do not see a rogue, but see everything else.  They have a large aggro range.<br />
<br />
Loathing Lich - undead Wizard - They look like a spectre and have very low magic resist but more hp than most mobs in Hate, plus are undead so undead magic works well, so usually easy kills.  But they will cast the wizard damage shield (the annoying 2 damage spam shield).  They drop a Necromancer rod.  They DO see a rogue as well as anything else.  *** BE CAREFUL ***  They have a small self-aggro range, but will pass chain-aggro other mobs a very large range.<br />
<br />
Abhorrent - Rogue - They look like gargoyles and have very low magic resist, but love to backstab, so make sure the puller is careful pulling them.  They drop rogue gear.  They do not see rogues or normal invisible.  They have a small aggro range.<br />
<br />
Haunted Chest - Warrior - They look like a bog box with teeth.  They will proc a Nullify Magic, so they will strip your buffs.  They can drop any armor item from the Planes of Fear, and possibly from Hate.  They do not see a rogue, but do see others.  They have an extremely small aggro range and are very slow.  When pulling, the puller has to stay close, or the box will forget and go home.  They even aggro other mobs at a very short range.  Boxes spawn only in fixed locations.  They are not on any other spawn table.<br />
<br />
Kiraikueis - undead Monk - They look like a mummy and have low magic resist.  They will proc Strong Disease.  They are undead, so undead magic works well on them.  They drop warrior gear and a monk Shuriken.  They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis, though invis to undead would work.  They have a very large aggro range, but a small pass-on range, so they will aggro with anything close, but not aggro the mobs around them... usually.<br />
<br />
Scorn Banshee - undead Warrior - They look like a female zombie and have low magic resist, but proc Strong Disease and hit a ton.  But undead magic works.  They drop Bard gear.  They DO see rogues and all invis, including invis to undead, regardless of what con says.  *** BE CAREFUL ***  They do have a small aggro range, though.<br />
<br />
Forsaken Revanant, Male - undead Magician - They look like male vampires and have normal magic resistance.  They also cast a mean damage shield and nasty AE direct damage.  Undead magic does work.  They drop mage gear.  They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis.  They have normal aggro range.<br />
<br />
Forsaken Revanant, Female - undead Enchanter - They look like female vampires and have high magic resistance, but they do not cast charm.  They do cast a damage shield, though.  Undead magic works.  They drop Enchanter gear.  They do not see rogues but do see normal invis.  They have normal aggro range.<br />
<br />
Ashenbone Drake - Necromancer - Looks like a skeletal dragon or a small DracoLiche from Fear.  They have high magic resist and love to cast Fear, plus they hit like a tank.  They drop a tank axe or a Shadow Knight shield or weapon.  They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis.  They have an insane aggro range and have been known to aggro stuff across the zone.  Be extremely careful on this one's aggro.<br />
<br />
Maestro of Rancor - Bard - Looks like Lord Mistmoore, but since he hasn't been seen in a long time, I guess Mistmoore looks like Maestro.  He is a Bard, but since NPCs do not use BardSong, you could say he's a warrior.  He hits a TON and has an ae lifetap on everything in melee range.  And if he has dual weapons, he hits extremely fast.  He normally drops 2 items, mostly Bard stuff, though a few monk items and a nice dropable shield.  He sees rogues and all normal invis, but his back is usually to the door so no problem.  He is the lesser boss of Hate.<br />
<br />
Innoruuk - god - He looks like Innoruuk, no other way to say it.  He does a DeathTouch every 30 seconds or so of the fight and loves to cast gravity flux.  He has a long list of drops, and most of it nice.  He sees rogues and will DeathTouch you in a heart-beat.<br />
<br />
Spawn Types:<br />
<br />
Zone-Patrol - The first you will see on porting up is the zone-patrol.  Zone-patrol is about 4 roaming spawns just to make plane breaking more difficult.  They will spawn on the east wall right behind either house 5 or I and walk the east wall S and up into the ceiling.  Occasionally, one will stop next to a house to buff the mobs inside and then cut at an angle due SW, which could lead them into the port room itself, but they do not stay there long.  However, since they are zone-patrol, they will usually be right beside the port room, so porting up could be a problem.  Zone-patrol can be Cleric, Spite, Ire, or Rat, and in that order of appearance.  Repop on zone-patrol is the same as static spawns if killed, so about 8 hours.  If they de-pop themselves, which they do if they make it to the zone-line, then the repop is about 30 minutes or so, but since they walk right by the zone-in, if you set up camp there, you will get them all.  They have a less than normal drop rate.<br />
<br />
Normal Roamers - There are 2 patrol routes in Hate, the North and South.  The North route is basically just as is drawn on the map, except that the mobs will make a square just north of the Fountain (house 8 )  and then head back up the path to the NW end of it.  The South route follows the path but where it stops on the south wall, the path actually continues along the south wall until past house T, then turns due north until just past the stairs in the NW corner of house C (beside house Q), turns east and follow N wall of house C to house A, then N around house A and back to meet the end of the drawn route.  On both of these route, there can be Lich, Rat, or Ire.  And they are both on a 30 minute timer, so be extremely careful.  Also, the route can run clockwise or counterclockwise, and the mobs can stop mid route and head back.  They like to stop on the S wall beside houses 2, U, and T, near the NW corner of house C, near the opening between A and C, beside house 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2, and near the Totem (the black dot between house 3 and 5.  In-game, is a pillar of faces with flames in their mouths).  Be extremely careful with them when near house 2 as they could easily aggro the stuff in house C.  The door to C is beside A, so if that happens, everything between C and the zone room will aggro.  All the roamers have low drop rates, though the Ires seem to have the pali items rather frequently.  But that could just be because there are so many of them.<br />
<br />
SW Corner - The SW corner is the other favorite pull spot (other than the zone-in room).  There are 3 semi-static spawns there, and they are 2 clerics and a monk.  They are on a 30 minute timer and have very low drop rates.  They are here for one reason only... because it was a great pull spot away from most of the roamer path.  By being a 30 minute spawn, it makes camping here much more difficult.  I still prefer the zone-in room, even though you have to fight with more of the roamer path.<br />
<br />
Static Spawns - The ones in the houses are static spawns, and even they come in two flavors.  Some of the houses are huge, so they have fixed spawn points and roamers within the houses.  Static Spawns have the highest drop rates and are on about an 8 hour timer.  I will cover houses shortly.<br />
<br />
Boss Mobs - This is Maestro and Inny.  Maestro spawns in the far NW corner of house D in front of the organ.  Inny is in a room upstairs.  Maestro is on the same static timer, while Inny is on a 7 day spawn, so usually just after a server repop.  If the server is reset, or the zone crashes, all mobs in Hate are depopped.  This is to provide a little safety during reentry.  When this happens, the timer for the entire zone starts at 0, so 30 minutes later, all the roamers will pop and the SW corner will pop, then about 8 more and the statics and Maestro will pop.  So, what players do is as soon as the server drops, they head in and setup since they only have to dead with the normal roamers and possibly the zone-patrol.  They then ask for a zone repop, which the gm will do as long as it is ONE person that asks, not everyone in the zone.<br />
<br />
Houses...<br />
<br />
House 1 is the zone-in house.  In fact, you will zone in almost exactly where the 1 is drawn on the map.  There are no spawns in this room, but the zone-patrol will walk right by the E wall (just outside the house).  Unless you are in the pull group or told otherwise, STAY AWAY FROM THE DOOR.  The pull team cannot get into and out of the room if everyone is crowded in the doorway.  And a fight there could aggro the other mobs the puller has.  Also, stay away from the N wall for a little while, as it could aggro some of the surrounding areas or the mobs pulled to pull spot.  The entrance is on the NW wall facing N (just under the rectangle on the map on the left side of the room... that rectangle is only a hall).<br />
<br />
House 2 has three spawns upstairs.  One is always a box.  The other two can be abhorrents or ires.  These do not aggro easily since all have short aggro ranges, so pulling past them is usually okay.  The usually do not aggro on break-in, either.  The only way the fights or pulls can aggro them is one of the mobs with a large aggro range, then it will trigger them as well.  It is best to pull this room early.  The entrance is on the N side.<br />
<br />
House 3 will always be pulled with the zone-patrol aggro.  The mobs from zone-patrol will aggro them, so at break-in, there will be no less than one from zone-patrol and the two from this house.  The two in this house are usually an abhorrent and an ire.  Entrance is on the W side.<br />
<br />
House 4 has a box upstairs.  Do not pull this house until at least the first half of house C is clear as it will aggro through the wall.  Entrance is on the NE side facing E (inside the L).<br />
<br />
House 5 has an abhorrent downstairs and an ire or abhorrent upstairs.  Upstairs will not aggro from a downstairs pull, but it will if you pull from beyond house 5.  If you do not pull upstairs here, it will autopull when you pull past it anyway.  Entrance is on the SW side facing W (looking at the door to house 4).<br />
<br />
House 6 has a box and ire upstairs.  These will not aggro from pulls around them at all and are usually the only mobs left in the zone after a full clearing.  They can be pulled or just left.  Pulls from here could aggro the neighboring rev houses, so it is best to leave for a while.  Entrance is on the W side.<br />
<br />
House 7 has a spawn right by the door and two more in the back of the house on the SE side.  All three spots can be abhorrents or ires.  Careful here as the S roamers like to stop just outside the door to this house, and the N roamers could stop just to the N of it.  Entrance is on the far SW side closest to house C facing SW.<br />
<br />
House 8 is not a house, but a fountain or well.  It is only a landmark.<br />
<br />
House 9 is the ramp up to Innoruuk's chamber.  I will cover level 2 later.  Ramp starts on E side.<br />
<br />
House A has a box and monk downstairs, and 2 abhorrents upstairs.  The monk will come as soon as you make a pull from anywhere near it, including the chamber.  The abhorrents are safe until you start pulling larger mobs past it.  The box may aggro on pulls, but has so short an aggro range it will usually stay there.  The entrance is on the SW side facing W.  You can see the box in the entrance.<br />
<br />
House B has an abhorrent and monk upstairs and the same downstairs.  The downstairs monk will always aggro from any pull nearby, especially the house C pulls.  The upstairs and the abhorrent downstairs are usually left for later (especially since there have been so many abhorrents so far).  Entrance is on the W side.<br />
<br />
House C is generally called the Chamber or the Cleric House.  This is the first goal to be cleared (to prevent wall aggros).  The entry is noted on the map (right beside house A).  guarding the entrance just inside are two clerics.  In the northern hallway (from the entrance to the NE corner), there is a single roamer, but he can be anything on the spawn table.  Usually, it is a spite, rev (male or female), lich, monk, or ire, but I have even seen a drake there.  Just be careful and look before charging into the room.  Mostly, though, it is a spite or rev.  In the far SE corner of the house is a throne, and there is a cleric on either side of it.  The central hall of house C (between houses B and V) has 2 spawns, and both are roamers.  One spawns on the far west end of the hall and roams to the east end.  The other spawns on the far east end of the central hall and will roam all the way to the far east wall of the house (close to house 2).  These two can also be any mob on the spawn table, but I mostly see rev, spite, ire, or lich on the east one, and rev, lich, ire, spite, or drake on the west one.  Be careful as the drakes have a huge aggro range.  A drake pull here could aggro a drake upstairs, and that would be very bad.  No real way to avoid it, but be careful.  The west side of the central hall has 2 clerics guarding the passage (just inside the west side).  There are also 2 roamers in the west end of the house just below the stairs, and the roam from the stairs to the central hall and back.  They can be anything on the table, but I mostly see lich, drake, or spite.  Usually, if one roamer is in the corner near the stairs, you can safely pull the other (once the 2 clerics are gone, that is).  In the far SW corner of the house, there is another roamer that stays in that corner.  I usually see lich or rat there, but have seen others also.  It is usually safe to pull from the west end and not get this guy, but he does need to be killed.  There is also a back entrance to the Chamber, noted on the map on the W wall just above the SW corner.  This is the door to pull through when you camp SW corner.<br />
<br />
House C upstairs has the same floor plan as downstairs.  All spots upstairs can be anything on the table.  There are two roamers at the top of the stairs (NW corner), one in SW corner, two in the central hall, and four in the East hall.  NW stays in NW corner, SW in SW, and the central hall stay there.  The ones in the east end will roam from just above the entrance downstairs (near house A) all the way to the SE corner.  NW is usually revs, SW a lich, central a monk or ire, and east is usually drake, spite, lich, and rat.  But again, anything can be in any spot.  It could be all drakes.  Of course, that would be very unlucky for most, nice for any sks, but still. <img src="images/smilies/emote_wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Wink" class="inlineimg" />    In most cases, the upstairs will not aggro from downstairs.  However, if there is a drake upstairs and down, they could overlap ranges and cause a chain aggro.  Usually, however, upstairs Chamber is left for later pulls.<br />
<br />
House D is the Chapel.  There are also a lot of mobs in here, and almost all of them are roamers.  Once the Chamber is clear, you should work on the Chapel so you can move camp.  The SW corner of the Chapel is generally called the Throne, and it is the next camp site (after Maestro is killed).  This is because it avoids most of the S patrol route, and there is a much much better pathing from the rev houses (NE corner) to the Chapel than to the zone-in room.  That path does cross the N roamer route, but there are less roamers on the N route than S.  Chapel entry is guarded by two clerics.  there are also two clerics in the far SW corner beside the throne.  The only other static spawns in the Chapel are Maestro and his guards.<br />
<br />
The Chapel roamers all have specific roam and pull paths.  There is one in the SW (usually monk) corner that stays in that area, one in the corner on the S wall closest to the entry (usually rev), one in the NE corner (usually scorn), and one in the corner of the stairs (NE of the entry) (usually rev).  There is another one just S of Maestro (just N of house P) that roams from that corner up to Maestro and back (usually abhorrent).  Pull him when on the S end of his route.  And in addition to these area roamers, there are about six or eight house roamers that will roam from near the throne area up to near Maestro over to near the stairs. All roamers can be monk, abhorrent, both revs, ire, lich, rat, scorn, or spite.  There are specific paths for each, but that is too much to put in this already long tutorial.<br />
<br />
The Chapel also has an upstairs, like the Chamber, but it is not a full floor plan.  There is a balcony overlooking the organ, so the 2nd floor is cut off from the top of the stairs angled a little S over to above the corner N of house P.  At the top of the stairs, there is one roamer, usually a rev or scorn.  In the SW corner is one, usually cleric or spite.  There is also one in the SE corner, usually rev or lich.  All three of these can be anything but drakes.<br />
<br />
Maestro floats just in front of his organ in the far NW corner of the house.  He will have 4 personal guards, 2 on each side of him.  In most cases, he will be facing NW, but will turn to face his guards when they buff him.  It is safe to scout up behind him, but if facing you, he will aggro.  His guards are always spites or clerics, and can be any mix from all of one, to a mix, or to all of the other.  The entire Chapel, upstairs and down, plus some of the surrounding houses must be pulled before he is or he will aggro everything in his path.  The best method for pulling him I've seen is for the scout to sit on the far east wall looking out between houses 5 and 6.  Make sure you are up the wall a little.  The puller hits Maestro and runs to the area in front of that alley and fds.  Do not go in the alley or Maestro will be too close to the scout and kill her.  The assister would come out to the corner by the totem and wait.  When the scouts sees only Maestro above the puller, she will give the word and the assister will shoot Maestro and pull him into the zone room.  For this to work takes timing, and the roamers must be clear.  The puller must stay down as the guards will probably still be aggroed on him, but they should be back home.  If they make it home, and the scout will go there to make sure, then the puller can get up.  If they do not come then, the puller is safe to join the fun pounding on Maestro and the scout can go poke some, too.  There are a number of tactics to actually kill him once pulled.  This is only info on how to pull him.  After he is dead, you can safely pull his guards as will any pull to split.<br />
<br />
Once this is done, the raid usually moves camp to the Throne area of the Chapel as noted before.  The scout will scout the path, and the puller or someone else will lead everyone there.  If attacked along the way, do NOT stop and fight.  Keep running and take the mob to the Throne.  If you fight in the hall, more roamers could spawn on you or you could aggro something not yet pulled.  Once camp is reset, the puller and scout can get back to work and pull everything else in the zone.<br />
<br />
House E has a male rev just inside the door and another all the way through near the bottom of the stairs.  There is a female rev at the top of the stairs on the second floor.  Entrance is on the N wall just above the E on the map.  <br />
<br />
House F has a rev outside just to the east of the entry and 2 more inside at the bottom of the stairs.  These are usually males, but could be either. Entrance is on the N wall.<br />
<br />
House G has three revs in the far S corner, and they are usually female.  Entrance is on the far N wall.<br />
<br />
House H has one male rev downstairs.  Entrance is on the SW corner facing west.<br />
<br />
House I has a box in the NE corner and a rev in the nw corner.  There is also a rev upstairs.  These can be either rev.  Entrance is in the central N wall facing N (middle of the U).<br />
<br />
House J has one rev downstairs and two more upstairs, and they can be male or female.  Entrance is on the W side.<br />
<br />
House K has one male rev in the SW corner downstairs and another upstairs.  Entrance is on the NW corner facing west.<br />
<br />
House L has a female rev downstairs and two more upstairs.  Entrance is on the NE corner facing east (looking into house K).<br />
<br />
House M has box in the far NW corner.  Entrance is on SW corner facing west.<br />
<br />
House N has two revs in the back (far southern tip of the house).  Entrance is on NW wall.<br />
<br />
House O has a scorn or monk.  Entrance is on W wall.<br />
<br />
House P has a monk and scorn downstairs, and a scorn or monk with a box upstairs.  This house is usually cleared before completing the Chapel.  Entrance is on E wall.<br />
<br />
House Q has two monks or scorns downstairs and two upstairs.  Entrance is on W wall.<br />
<br />
House R has a monk or scorn downstairs and another upstairs.  Entrance is on far SE wall.<br />
<br />
House S has a box in the NW corner and a scorn or monk in NE corner.  There is nothing upstairs.  But there are the corner spawns outside (monk and 2 clerics in SW zone corner).  Entrance is in the center of the U.<br />
<br />
House T has nothing that I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
House U has a monk or scorn.  Entrance is on NE wall facing east.<br />
<br />
House V has a monk or scorn upstairs.  Entrance is on NW wall facing west.<br />
<br />
For the revs, monks, and scorns, I have been as accurate as possible.  So don't count the mobs here and then what you find and say I am wrong.  It is nearly impossible for a rogue to get accurate scorn counts since they see us.  And the revs are done so seldom that I forget on them.  But I think this is almost perfect.<br />
<br />
Now, Up the ramp to Innoruuk... (House 9 on the map)<br />
<br />
At the top of the ramp, there are two drakes.  They can be pulled without aggroing anything else.  Once at the top of the ramp, there are only four doors you can go into.  The one on the S side, closest to the ramp is a small house.  There is a monk, scorn, abhorrent, or spite upstairs in there.<br />
<br />
There are two entries on the east side of the courtyard up there, the S one goes nowhere, the N one has a small house with 2 spawns, usually cleric, rev, monk, or scorn.  Careful with this one as it could aggro Innoruuk through the wall (wall is close to the west T at the end of his hall).<br />
<br />
The entrance to the N of the area at the top of the ramp is Innoruuk's Hall.  The hall goes N, turns right and heads east, then turns south and goes to a T that turns east and west, both of which dead end.  There are two static spawns guarding the door.  They can be anything but drakes (though not seen a rat there either).  Within the hall, everything else, including Innoruuk himself, will roam.  Some will roam all the way to the entrance, but only as deep as about half of the east hall going S.  Others, including Innoruuk, will roam only to the far NW corner of the Hall, but will go all the way back to the T, and roam between the two ends of the T.  The roamers can be anything but drakes and rats.  There are also 2 deep roamers back at the T, and they are always drakes.<br />
<br />
Be very careful pulling the Hall.  Inny will see sneaking.  I have never even been able to sneak behind him, though that is probably just my bad luck and he turns around.  And he will Death Touch.  Every mob in the Hall except the 2 drakes in the back can be pulled without aggroing Inny.  You just have to watch for him and get out of his way.<br />
<br />
Normal Inny pulling takes four people, the puller, the assister, the scout, and the sacrifice.  The scout will check on his location (best to pull him from the NW corner near entrance so as to avoid aggroing the drakes in the back), then get out of the way.  The sacrifice will charge and take the DT.  The puller will then pull Inny and run for the Throne.  If lucky and properly buffed, he can make it back there.  If not, the assister grabs Inny and pulls him the rest of the way.  Then you fight him.  The scout then goes safely into the hall and drags out the body of the sacrifice to be resed.  <br />
<br />
Break-in...<br />
<br />
Break-in can be one of 2 methods, and both work well, depending on the skills of the groups.  It can be either a rogue in the first group to scout and tell when the zone-patrol has gone be so can get some safety on entry.  For this method, everyone must be invisible.  As soon as you get in, move the S wall of the room and camp (NOT /q, camp), then meet in a chat room.  The scout will still be in and talking to the group.  The last group up usually ports up about the same time that the scout has someone (usually someone with 2 systems so in chat and on another character in-game, or someone on a twink logs out to chat) tells the folks in chat to log in.  Once everyone is in, the fights start.<br />
<br />
The other method is 2 good groups head up at once and start fighting.  The next groups head up in pairs a few minutes apart (to keep from crashing the zone with too many folks zoning into the same area all at once).  This is the much faster method, but is also more dangerous since the mobs in house 3 will aggro any roamers going by, who could aggro the mobs in house C, who could... In any event, either method works well as I have been in on both.  I tend to prefer the fighting-break since less time spent, and the aggro mobs in house C are not that frequent.<br />
<br />
Pulling...<br />
<br />
Pull team consists of a scout (the rogue), puller (fder), assister (warrior), cleric, and 2 others.  I prefer the 2 others to be enchanter and another healer.  I like an enchanter there so he/she knows what is coming in since he may want to mez the first and hold it to fight the second.  I like a backup healer to help keep the assister and chanter alive, and to keep the fder and ME alive. <img src="images/smilies/emote_wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Wink" class="inlineimg" />  <br />
<br />
The scout will do just that... scout.  She will tell the fder what mobs are where so as to avoid a lot of fd if possible, especially since the fd change where higher mobs usually do not forget the fder.  There are several key vantage points to watch from, but most important until house C is clear is to watch for aggro from there.  When the puller pulls, tell him how many and what he has.  If he has 4 mobs, that is usually okay, unless it is 4 spites.  It is up to you as scout, the puller, and the chanter as to whether to bring in the pull or let some of it get away.  Don't worry if you miss some, they will still be there.<br />
<br />
The puller pulls mobs.  The usual fd spot is in the in corner of the L of house 3 just N  of the entry to house 1.  As long as the fights are inside house 1, mobs there will usually not aggro.  Puller pulls to there and fds.  Then the assister, when told to pull, hits one with bow to pull it into the room.  If the way is clear behind the puller (what the scout watches for), then the puller gets up and pulls some more.  <br />
<br />
If there is only 1 mob in the fight room, be it the zone-in room or the SW corner, then there are not enough mobs.  A constant pull flow keeps everyone busy and happy.  It also clears the path the absolute best spot to pull to in the zone... the Chapel (house D).<br />
<br />
Pull order on all of the houses is up to the pull team and leader of the raid.  Please do NOT ask that some mob get pulled.  If the pull team is a good one, they will try their best to keep a very balanced set of pulls in order to keep everyone happy.  Revs are usually the last to be pulled, but if the pull team is good, they can get a few of the rev houses before clearing the Chapel.  Houses U and V can also be pulled as soon as house C is clear, which would help keep the bards and warriors happy.  Any other pull notes, I have made in the tutorial.<br />
<br />
Always use assist.  If you start beating on a mezzed target, the enchanters will start yelling and may even cut off your clarity or swift supply.  Don't make the dealers mad.<br />
<br />
Only the puller and scout have SoW and are in run mode.  No one else needs speed.  If you use wolf-form, then not much you can do to avoid it.  The reason is that some mobs fear, and Maestro could Charm.  Either of these things happen while you have SoW going, and you will end up a long way off.  If you get feared, you could end up on the NE corner or the NW corner (depending where you are set up).  If you get lost out there from fear, don't worry.  The scout can find you and take you back.  If you are killed, no matter where you are killed, the scout can find you and take you back for a res.  If under Maestro or Inny, it might take a few minutes, but she will get you back for a res.  Don't worry, no one gets left in Hate.  Well, not usually. <img src="images/smilies/emote_wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Wink" class="inlineimg" />  <br />
<br />
Either the main chanter or the scout will call camp.  No one else.  If they are both dead, it is usually not a good sign anyway.  If camp is called, you MUST protect the clerics and help them get out first.  If you are a tank and camp while a cleric is being beaten, you will probably be run out of the raid.  Clerics can res anyone back up.  If all the clerics are dead, it means porting new clerics up to res.  Clerics and Enchanters are the two main classes to be protected.  None of the mobs in Hate are very hard.  In fact, most are rather easy.  But only in small numbers or in controllable situations.  A lot of mobs with no healing or crowd control, and everyone dies.  It's not so much that the deaths hurt since everyone there should be getting a lvl 49 or higher res anyway, but it does break the rhythm of the hunt and add some serious downtime.  With a good pull team, there will always be mobs to kill, and everything will be under control... usually.  Even with the best team, accidents can happen.  If they do, just try again.  Don't get discouraged or blame the pull team.<br />
<br />
The objective is to have a fun and adventuresome trip.  Just remember that, and everything else will fall into place.<br />
<br />
Have fun, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.<br />
