<i><b>Note:</b>  There are a couple scenes in this episode which while not gratuitous for the sake of violence, are a bit graphically intense.  Reader discretion is advised.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
The Hilltop Diner was busy considering the location and time of day.  It was eleven o'clock in the morning and three customers were having a late breakfast while one more waited for his order.  The road which serviced the diner had been bypassed with the creation of an interstate highway a mile and a half to the south so the only customers who came in were locals, as well as the occasional city dweller hoping to catch some walleye or rainbow trout at Dailey Lake further down the road.<br />
<br />
&quot;Order up&quot; the cook called out, slamming his spatula on the bell.<br />
<br />
The waitress smiled and took the plate, delivering it to a customer at the end of the counter.  The door opened and she looked up to offer a smile to her next customer.  When the man entered, accompanied by two bodyguards, her face went pale.  &quot;Joseph&quot; she sadly greeted the familiar face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah&quot; he replied. &quot;You're waiting tables?&quot; He shook his head in disappointment.  &quot;What a waste of such a talented young mind.  It's time for you to come back now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you find me?&quot;  she replied calmly, though her mind was yelling at her to turn and run away as fast as she could. <br />
<br />
Joseph looked at her and with a calm demeanor answered. &quot;You knew when you left that you couldn't hide forever.  You're very important to my work.  Your children are very important to my work.  We've been watching you for a while now.  Where are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears began pooling up in her eyes, but with a strong voice she answered him. &quot;I won't let them be your guinea pigs.  I'll <b>never</b> tell you where they are.&quot;  She scanned the parking lot out front and noticed several identical dark sedans; vehicles which surely belonged to Dr. Joseph Stevenson's goon squad.<br />
<br />
Joseph looked at her with sad eyes. &quot;We have this place surrounded, Sarah.  This time you've nowhere to run.  Please come peacefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cook stormed out from the kitchen.  &quot;She ain't goin' nowhere with you if she don't wanna, so get the hell outta here or I'll call the cops!&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the bodyguards calmly pulled out a pistol from under his jacket and fired at the cook; two in the chest, one in the head.  The few customers in the diner went dumb, shocked by the sight of a person being gunned down in cold blood.  Joseph didn't even blink.  &quot;Sarah, please.  As you can see, by disobeying me you only end up hurting the people around you.  Come with me and tell me where you've hidden our children, and I promise that I won't punish you for running away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah was struck dumb as well; she began focusing on the dead cook splayed awkwardly on the floor, then back to Joseph.  He saw her confusion and took a step closer.  &quot;They must be almost two years old by now, aren't they?&quot; Still dumbstruck, Sarah answered with a slow nod.  &quot;Wouldn't you like to celebrate their birthday together, as a family?  We could all have cake, and ice cream, and presents...&quot; He was almost to her when she broke from her spell and bolted for the kitchen.  &quot;Sarah, don't be difficult&quot; he said in an unnervingly cold voice.<br />
<br />
She grabbed her purse and ran to the back window; Joseph wasn't lying when he said that she was surrounded.  She looked back to find him standing at the kitchen entrance with a disappointed look on his face.  &quot;You don't want me to punish you, Sarah.  It's time to come with me, and it's time to tell me where you hid the children. NOW, Sarah. I want to know, NOW!&quot;  For the first time he raised his voice, and Sarah began to sob.  She knew she was trapped, and would soon face his wrath.<br />
<br />
She ran into the bathroom and closed the door behind her, then sat down against the back wall and fumbled through her purse.  It was heavy and cumbersome, but from the bottom of her purse she pulled out a .38 calibre snub-nosed revolver and pointed it at the door.  She tried to steady it, but her fear, uncertainty, and its heft made her arms sway like a ship in rough seas.  She knew it would be a miracle if she hit anything.  <i>'I have to try.  I have to protect Cathy and Cynthia from him. I won't let him hurt my babies!'</i> she thought to herself, which only made her eyes tear up and her arms sway more.<br />
<br />
Joseph walked to the bathroom door and knocked.  &quot;Sarah, please.  I'm opening the door now&quot; he said through the door, then began to turn the knob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't come in!  I have a gun!  I'll shoot you!&quot; she yelled in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, don't be foolish.  You don't have a gun.  I know you.  You're deathly afraid of guns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice went cool, as if the emotion was suddenly sucked from it.  &quot;Yes, you're right, I <i>am</i> afraid of guns... but I'm more afraid of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph paused, wondering if she was bluffing, now not so sure.  He let go of the doorknob and talked to her through the door.  &quot;Be reasonable, Sarah.  Just tell me where you've hidden our children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're not your children!&quot; she yelled, her emotion returning with a vengeance.<br />
<br />
In a soothing voice he answered back. &quot;Yes they are, Sarah.  I spent years testing for the right genetic candidates.  I performed the operation to impregnate you.  I created an environment where the mutant gene would thrive.  <i>We</i> created them. You and I, together.  In terms of the creation of life, I'm just as much their father as you are their mother.&quot;  Sarah didn't respond, but through the door Joseph could hear her crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no way out, Sarah.  The time for running is over; it's time for you and the children to come back&quot; he calmly stated. &quot;Is life at the research center really so bad?  You can be with your children, all your needs will be taken care of, and all you have to do is endure the occasional experiment or two.  I'll even let you work on some of your old research projects, though at a diminished capacity, of course.  Doesn't that sound like a reasonable compromise?&quot;<br />
<br />
His question was answered with a single gunshot.  He opened the bathroom door to find Sarah slumped on her side, a pool of blood slowly radiating from her head.  &quot;Oh, Sarah. What have you done...&quot; he sighed.  He then turned to his bodyguards.  &quot;Kill the customers.  I don't want any witnesses.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***2***<br />
<br />
<br />
Twenty-eight years later and thousands of miles away Cathy scanned her closet, then looked back to her clothes lying on her bed. <i>'Our closet. Our bed'</i> she corrected herself.  In the back of her mind she heard the phone ringing, but she was busy trying to fit the extra clothes she had brought back from Belize into the walk-in closet.  &quot;Gerr, you got the phone?&quot; she called out right as the ringing stopped.<br />
<br />
She turned her attention back to the closet, eyeing Gerald's clothes on the other side.  There was plenty of space on his side, as most of his clothes were still in his apartment on the other side of the country.   She had just given him that portion of the closet the day before and she didn't want to intrude on his stuff, but it was so tempting.  The empty space was taunting her. She gathered up the remains of the clothes on the bed.  &quot;Well, you guys get to stay with my costumes&quot; she said, walking out of the bedroom and into the room she used to keep all her 'Nightprowl related' things.  She opened that room's closet and pushed the half-dozen Nightprowl costumes to one side, then hung up the rest of her clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cat, where are you? That was Charles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In here&quot; she called out.<br />
<br />
Gerald entered the room and looked into the closet.  Cathy looked over her shoulder at him and could see the slight smile on his face.  &quot;What?&quot; she asked, wondering why he was smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing.  You're just starting to take your apartment back from <i>'her'</i>.&quot; he noted, nodding at her Nightprowl costumes.<br />
<br />
Cathy rolled her eyes.  &quot;Whatever you say, Sigmund.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. I've come into a windfall of nice clothing and I need places to put them.  Maybe I <i>should've</i> hung them up in your half of the closet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you didn't&quot; he replied, putting his hands on her hips and kissing her on the neck. &quot;I'm heading off to work.  Charles said his plane would be landing at around eleven so he should be home around noon, and he said he's got a surprise for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, great.  The last time Charles gave me a surprise I woke up in Central America.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that kind of surprise.  I think you'll like it&quot; he smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a sec, you know what it is?  Tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I told you then it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're a meanie&quot; Cathy replied with a fake pout.  Gerald only responded with a laugh.  &quot;So does it look like they're going to keep you on as a new teacher?&quot; she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wasn't sure when I asked about staying on here in Paragon City, but since I first talked to them they've received a very large anonymous donation, and can fit me into the new budget.  Do you have any idea who might be the mysterious donator?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think I might know one billionaire who's daughter is a mutant who will probably end up in your classroom sooner or later, but it's probably just a coincidence&quot; Cathy replied with a grin<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, must be a coincidence&quot; Gerald answered, knowing full well that Charles was using his money for Madison's benefit.  &quot;I still don't like you being involved with him though.  He kidnapped you, and probably still has less than pure thoughts about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're a package deal Gerry, and Madison more than offsets Charles' misgivings.  Charles really is a decent man, he's just confused. I know he still has feelings for me, but he's getting the help he needs; that was a big part of our agreement.  I can't just leave Madison without a motherly figure in her life.&quot;<br />
<br />
The 'mother' comment seemed to hang between them, Cathy knowing she wasn't getting any younger and Gerald wondering how much was expected of him at this point in their relationship.  She seemed to read his thoughts and said &quot;I'm not ready for one of my own yet.  Maybe in a few years, but I'm not in a hurry.&quot;  The moment still seemed to hang, as Cathy was unsure that she meant what she'd just said and it shone through in her voice.  Gerald thought for a moment, and decided to unveil Charles' surprise.  &quot;Madison's your niece.  That's the surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Cathy replied, truly shocked at what he'd just said.  &quot;How?  Really?  You sure?&quot;  The glow in Cathy's eyes and her inability to stop smiling told Gerald that he'd made the right decision. With a smile that matched Cathy's he answered her.  &quot;Charles says he's positive.  I have to go to work, but you can get the whole story when you see him this afternoon.  Are you happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy still couldn't stop smiling, so she just nodded, and in a burst of spontaneity kissed Gerald on the lips then wrapped her arms around him and gave him a big hug.  Gerald was warmed by Cathy's affection. &quot;And to think I was going to let Charles tell you.  I can be so stupid sometimes.&quot;  He returned the hug and reminded Cathy that he had to get to work, so she kissed him lightly and let him go.<br />
<br />
As he was leaving he considered saying nothing, but felt he needed to hear her say it.  &quot;Cathy, you remember our agreement, right?  About looking for Trish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Gerry&quot; she replied.  &quot;No solo investigations.  I've got a lead I'm checking out this morning, but it's strictly surveillance to see if there's anything going on, and Rage will be with me.<br />
<br />
<br />
***3***<br />
<br />
<br />
So there Cathy sat, in full 'Nightprowl' mode minus the costume, perched high on a rooftop in Brickstown which overlooked the front door of a small insurance agency.  A business which Nick claimed was a front for a top secret Crey research facility.  She remembered back to the deal he'd made, and the tirade she went on after the District Attorney told her about it.  He'd only give his information to Nightprowl, and if the information was accurate and one of these locations was where Dr. Joseph Stevenson was conducting his experiments, then he'd walk with five years of probation. &quot;Un-freakin'-believable&quot; she muttered to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's unbelievable?&quot; she heard a familiar voice ask from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hi Harry.  Grab a seat, there's not much going on&quot; she replied, glancing over to make sure it was indeed Frozen Rage, a fellow supergroup member who'd agreed to keep her company on the stakeout.  &quot;I was just thinking about the deal the DA offered to Nick.  The little bastard damn near killed me, yet if this lead proves to be good then he's a free man. I kind of hope the information is wrong, just so he'd stay behind bars.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage just shrugged his shoulders.  &quot;That's the life of a DA.  They have to know when to go for the jugular, and know when to offer the sweet deal... so they can go for a more important person's jugular.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's just that Nick went for <i>my</i> jugular, and I'm kind of attached to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage kept an eye on the business while Cathy answered a few e-mails that had piled up and she called back a few heroes who had phoned her.  After a few hours of quietly watching the building, Cathy spoke up.  &quot;I have a little riddle that I'm trying to figure out.  Let's say a woman is told that a girl is her daughter based on a DNA test, then is later told that the girl is her niece, based on the same DNA test.  How is that possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's simple.  the woman has a twin sister, and the girl is the woman's sister's daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the woman's not human&quot; she replied without thinking. The look Cathy made and Frozen Rage's response to it told her that she'd said a bit too much.  &quot;The woman's me&quot; she admitted.  &quot;The person who's supposed to be my twin sister never mutated. She was human.  Her DNA shouldn't have matched mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage thought about it for a moment.  &quot;You're right, if she was human your DNA wouldn't match.  Are you sure she wasn't a mutant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't have a tail, and her husband said she was human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't mean she wasn't a mutant, especially a mutant with a condition like yours.&quot;  He held up two fingers and closed them together.  &quot;Snip-snip, no more tail.  You're not human, but you look human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy shook her head in disagreement. &quot;She wouldn't do that.  I mean, I wouldn't cut off my tail any more than I'd cut off my right arm.  It's part of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you <i>always</i> feel that way?  You've never looked at it and thought 'I'd be normal again if I just got rid of this tail'?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy wavered for a moment.  &quot;Well in the beginning when I was scared I might have thought about it, but I never seriously thought of getting rid of it.  I guess my situation was a little different though, because when I was 'outed' it didn't matter whether or not I got rid of it; everyone knew I'd grown it.  But still, even without the tail she would have had my reflexes.  She would have had to tell Charles that she was different the second he caught her running at 30 miles per hour or jumping over a ten foot wall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love can do strange things, Cathy.  Maybe he did see her do some unusual things, but refused to acknowledge them because he was afraid of losing her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy just stared at the business across the street, thinking about what Frozen Rage had just said.  It was then that something dawned on her.  &quot;Hey, those two never went in there, did they?  Those two that just came out the front door.  They came out, but they never went in first.&quot;  Frozen Rage looked at them carefully.  &quot;I think you're right.&quot;  They began paying more attention not to the flow of people in and out, but to the customers themselves. The same pattern emerged. The customers who were coming out of the business weren't the same ones as who were going in.  The flow seemed normal, but there was something very weird going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to take a closer look&quot; Cathy decided.  She scanned Frozen Rage's frost covered body and with a grin added  &quot;I'd let you come but I 'm pretty sure they'd catch on that you're a hero. You stay here; I'll be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage gave her a stern look. &quot;Cathy, get back here.  This is recon only.  What do you think you're going to do in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
She just gave him an innocent little smile and replied &quot;They sell insurance, so I'm going to buy insurance, Harry.  Be back in a bit&quot;.  She backed away and dropped down into the alley to prepare for a little 'close up' surveillance.  She wrapped her tail around her waist and pulled down on her jacket to cover her mutation, then casually walked out into the street.  <i>'Just a normal, run-of-the-mill, human customer'</i> she told herself before jogging across the street, peering into the window, then entering the business.<br />
<br />
An innocent wide-eyed glaze passed over Cathy's face, and she began to play up the 'ditzy blonde' stereotype.  She surveyed the room, noting several people working at desks.  They were rather burly men dressed in suits that were tailored to hide a bulge under the armpit, while a lone woman in a business suit rose up and walked towards Cathy.  She offered up a big, toothy smile as she approached.  The men sitting at the desks were stern-faced, and Cathy's arrival seemed to be holding their attention away from their work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello&quot; the woman said. &quot;My name's Marina. How may I help you?  Are you here for an appointment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy flipped her head to the side and in an innocent, valley girl drawl she replied &quot;Well, ya know, I was just walkin' by and saw the big 'Insurance' sign, ya know, and thought 'I've been meaning to get some life insurance but haven't had the time', ya know, and I have the time now, and I saw the sign so I said to myself 'Yes, I'll go in right now!' because, ya know, I'm gonna have to do it sooner or later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't take walk-ins, ma'am.  That's why we have the 'by appointment only' notice <i>under</i> the sign.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  I just saw 'Insurance', and decided to get some insurance, ya know?&quot;  Cathy replied, turning around and scanning the entire room, making sure to check for various security devices as well as the behaviour of the employees. Waving a hand to the room she said &quot;Ya mean all these people here are already doin' stuff for customers?  I'm sorry, my husband says I can get a bit scatterbrained at times.  I think I must have Adult ADD or something, ya know.  I'm not good with arranging things ahead of time.  Thanks for your time though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy turned to leave when the woman spoke up.  &quot;Wait, ma'am.  I've got a light schedule today, so if you'd like to take a seat, I'm sure we can bend this one rule to fit you in.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'Oh great.  Now what?'</i> Cathy though, turning around and smiling at the woman.  &quot;Oh thank you.  I'll be sure to recommend you to all my friends...  I'll even make sure to remind them to phone for an appointment first!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy quickly sat down so as to hide any possible bulging of her tail, and began to inspect Marina's desk under the guise of fidgeting with her stapler.  &quot;Please put that down&quot; she said, so Cathy did, but then began flipping through the business cards in the holder on Marina's desk.  &quot;They're all the same&quot; Marina said.  &quot;Take one if you'd like.&quot;  Cathy did, then tapped the edge of the card on the desk, turned it 90 degrees, tapped again, turned 90 degrees, and repeated the process. She was slowly driving Marina nuts with her fidgeting.  Marina began to regret tending to this customer, but orders are orders, and the boss contacted her through her earpiece and told her to serve this customer instead of throwing her out.  She began to fill out the life insurance form. &quot;Name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pippi.  After Pippi Longstockings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marina paused for a moment, then stated &quot;Last name as well, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I guess it would be 'Hunter', same as mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait?  This isn't for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no... my name's Debbie.  It's for my little snookum wookum.  She's the cutest little puppy dog you've ever seen!  I'd have her with me, but she's been feeling a bit under-the-weather.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want life insurance for your <i>dog</i>?  Well, what breed is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy played up the dumb blonde role to the hilt.  With as innocent an expression as she could muster, she replied &quot;Oh, I don't know, she's just a mutt I picked up from the pound. Does that matter?&quot;  The woman ran her hand over her head and gritted her teeth.  It was time for Cathy to let her off the hook, as she had the information she'd come for.  She looked up at the clock on the wall. &quot;Oh, my lord... is that the correct time?&quot; Cathy asked.  &quot;My watch is almost forty minutes slow!  It must've stopped.  I'm <i>really</i> sorry, but we're going to have to continue this later.  I'm going to be late for a lunchdate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy quickly rose from the chair and picked a few more business cards from the holder ('they're for my friends' she whispered to Marina), then she smiled and turned around.  One of the men was standing, looking past Cathy at Marina behind her.  He appeared to be positioning himself to step in front of Cathy should he be ordered not to let her leave.  <i>'Just try it, buddy.  I'll feed you your fist.'</i> Cathy thought.  She smiled at the man and walked past him, giving him wide enough berth so as to be able to act if he made a move towards her; he didn't.  Cathy walked out the front door and looked through the window at all the employees staring at her.  She gave another ditzy smile and a wave before walking off down the street.  <i>'Something fishy's going on in there... no doubt about it.'</i><br />
<br />
After casually walking down a few blocks and turning the corner, she quickly lept up to a rooftop and made her way back to Frozen Rage's position.  &quot;Well, that was unusual&quot; she said to him, lifting up her jacket to let out her tail.  &quot;Oh, that feels better.  I didn't realize selling insurance was so dangerous that they had to pack heat while sitting at their desks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know what they say, people are dying for their insurance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, groan&quot; Cathy replied, though it got a small chuckle out of her.  &quot;I think we should take a closer look as they're closing up shop tonight.  Sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan.  I think we should get a meat shield though; there were quite a few people that went in there, and if things get nasty I'd like someone who can pull a few bad guys away from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, okay.  I still think I could do it on my own, but I promised Gerry I would take backup.  If my backup wants backup, then who am I to argue.  I know a lady who knows a guy who can fill the bill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Cathy, sooner or later you're going to use up your nine lives.  I think your boyfriend would just rather it be later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know, I know.  I'll see you tonight; I'm off to see my niece.&quot;  Cathy couldn't held but smile, and recited the words in her head once more: <i>'My niece'</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet you ten-to-one your sis was a mutant too&quot; He offered as she jumped away<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't take that bet... I think you're right.&quot; she called out, and lept off to see Madison.<br />
<br />
<br />
***4***<br />
<br />
<br />
Cathy headed back to her place, then after a shower and change of clothes she went up to the penthouse suite to meet Charles and Madison.  Days ago Charles confessed to Cathy that he had bought out the top floor of her building shortly after she'd moved to Paragon City as a way to closely monitor her (to which Cathy mentally substituted 'monitor' with 'stalk'). After the events in Belize, Charles decided that he and Madison would temporarily move to Paragon City while Simon was to remain in Belize to oversee security upgrades to the mansion.  Simon was to also monitor the combat suit project that Cathy encouraged Charles to continue, regardless of how easily she had dismantled it in her fight against Nick.<br />
<br />
Cathy entered Charles' apartment using the key he had given her.  &quot;Hello, it's Cathy!&quot; she called out before walking into the living room.  There were two older people sitting on the couch, and both were looking at her with a wide-eyed expression.  It took a second but it clicked in her mind, and she quickly remembered their faces from Charles' photo albums.  They were Cynthia's parents.  &quot;Oh, hello.  I'm Cathy&quot; she said.  <i>'Of course they know who you are'</i> she chastised herself, seeing the expressions on their faces.<br />
<br />
Cathy heard Charles call out from the kitchen.  &quot;Cathy, is that you?  Could you come into the kitchen for a second?&quot;  Cathy smiled at the two in the living room and told them she'd be right back, then walked into the kitchen to find Madison on Charles' shoulders.  Charles was holding a press pot full of coffee steady on the counter, and Madison was about to press down the plunger to separate the coffee from the coffee grounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Cathy!&quot; she said with a smile.  &quot;I'm making coffee!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi sweetie.  Yes, I see that!&quot; she replied. Madison pressed down the plunger and Charles put the pot on a serving tray with three cups.  Charles held up a fourth cup but Cathy shook her head, not in the mood for a hot beverage.  Cathy held out her arms and Madison leaned back and fell into them, where she lowered Madison to the ground. &quot;So how do you like Paragon City?  It's big, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison's eyes widened and she nodded.  &quot;Uh-huh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy,&quot; Charles said with a concerned look. &quot;Madison's grandparents might be under the impression that I met you while you were vacationing in Belize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn't be because you <i>told them</i> that we met while I was vacationing in Belize, would it?&quot; she asked with a hint of disapproval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes.  I couldn't exactly tell them the truth, could I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy thought about it for a moment and decided that this would be one of those times where telling the truth might be more problematic than bending it.  &quot;Yes, you could've told them the truth, but since you didn't I will go along with it.  Did you tell them any place in particular, or just 'Belize'?  I like to get my lies straight&quot; she replied in a further show of disapproval<br />
<br />
With a meek voice Charles answered &quot;Just Belize.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy opened the fridge and after eyeing a beer, she decided to take a can of Diet Coke instead.  She also pulled out a juice box for Madison.  &quot;Charles,&quot; she said as she closed the fridge door and turned around.  &quot;was Cynthia a mutant?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles wasn't prepared for the question.  &quot;Let's just go into the living room.  We can talk there.  I told Jessica and Arthur about you and they told me... things.  They came here because they felt they needed to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'So it's true'</i>.  &quot;Okay&quot; she replied.  Cathy turned to Madison, knelt down to her level, and handed her the juice box.  &quot;So, how about you introduce me to your grandparents, Madison?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison nodded, took Cathy by the hand, and led her back into the living room.  &quot;Cathy, this is grandmama Jessica and grandpapa Arthur.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Charles served the coffee, Cathy leaned over and offered a handshake. &quot;Hi.  I'm not going to beat around the bush&quot; she said.  &quot;Was Cynthia a mutant like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy's directness brought a smile to Jessica's face. &quot;You are so much like her, even in the way you talk. Yes,&quot; she answered  &quot;we believe Cynthia was your twin sister.  I know it's hard to believe, but I'm relatively certain of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you my...&quot; she said uneasily, wondering whether Cynthia was given up for adoption, or whether she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no dear, we're not your birth parents, but I don't think your mother and father are your biological parents either.&quot;  Jessica stared at her coffee, contemplating how to begin. She seemed to go off on a tangent when she asked &quot;Cathy, did your mother mention whether there were any complications during your birth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She said that I was a difficult birth, but she didn't mention specifics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica took a sip of her coffee and began to talk about the birth of her daughter.  &quot;When Cynthia was born she was very sick.  I knew that something wasn't right when I first saw her, and when the doctor immediately took her from me for medical attention, I became very upset.  For almost two days they wouldn't even let me see her.  When they finally said she was healthy and ready to go home I was elated, but the baby they gave me was not my Cynthia.  I had only seen her for a moment at birth, but I knew the baby wasn't her.<br />
<br />
I became upset and emotional, and Arthur became angry, so the doctors took us to a private area of the hospital where they told us the truth.  My baby had died hours after birth due to an underdeveloped heart, but before they were to tell me the tragic news, the doctor in charge was told by his boss that he had a situation in which a healthy newborn baby needed to be hidden from some very bad people.  He was told to stall me and Arthur until this other baby arrived at the hospital, and this new baby would take the place of Cynthia as a way to hide her from the people who were searching for her.  There would be no paper trail and the number of people who knew what happened to the baby could be counted on one hand, giving her the best chance not to be found by those searching for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you think the same thing happened to me, only my mother didn't notice the switch?&quot; Cathy replied, to which Jessica nodded.  &quot;Hold on a sec&quot; Cathy added.  &quot;Charles said I was exactly like her except that I had a tail, and she didn't.  Now you're telling me that she <i>did</i> have a tail?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She had it amputated shortly after it grew in.  We knew that people were looking for her, so when she mutated we contacted the doctor who gave her to us.  He arranged for us a three week trip to Oslo while we let her tail grow in, and he flew in during the last week to perform the surgery. Cynthia agreed that she would would hide her mutant agility to avoid attracting suspicion.  We stressed to her that if she was discovered, the 'bad people' might try and take her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does explain a lot of things&quot; Charles added.  &quot;She absolutely adored cats.  Zeus and Magick were like her children.  We've given away millions to cat-related charities because she asked me to.  I didn't realize that it was because she felt a kinship with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy saw the look that Charles was giving her, he was almost asking her out loud whether she had the same feelings.  She dismissed it without a response and turned to Jessica.  &quot;Thank you for telling me all this&quot; she said, then a warm smile grew across her face.  &quot;So that means you're my aunt Jessica and uncle Arthur&quot;.<br />
<br />
Soon Madison became bored with the grown up conversation and wandered back to her room to play and as they were talking Jessica remembered something she had brought for Cathy.  &quot;Oh, I almost forgot&quot; she said as she rummaged through her purse and pulled out an old manilla envelope.  Jessica held it out to Cathy.  &quot;This was given to Cynthia when she had her tail removed.  You should look through it too.  This was to stress to her that she had to keep her mutation a secret.  It has information about your mother, Dr. Sarah Patton, and about her mentor, Dr. Joseph Stevenson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy took the envelope and slid out its contents.  The first thing that caught her attention was an article cut from The Montana Standard newspaper.  It read: 'Six Dead in Diner Massacre'.  She scanned the article and noticed that Sarah Patton was one of the dead.  She then noticed an old picture of a woman roughly her age posing with a man. She bore a definite resemblance to Cathy, so much so that Cathy didn't have to be convinced that the woman was her mother.  The man in the picture was a tall and older man with white hair, apparently in his 50s.  He had a stern but fatherly look on his face.  &quot;This is Dr. Stevenson I presume?&quot; she said, to which Jessica replied yes.<br />
<br />
Other papers in the envelope were of tests and reports of various scientific experiments, most of a disturbingly illegal nature. &quot;They won't hesitate to kill you if they think you can uncover their operation.&quot;  This time it was Arthur finally speaking. &quot;Be careful&quot;  he added.<br />
<br />
Cathy gave Arthur a slight smile and with a wink she replied &quot;I'm a very hard person to kill. I figure I've still got six or seven of my nine lives left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy looked back down the hallway towards Madison's room, then looked at Charles.  &quot;If this Dr. Stevenson was interested in Cynthia and me, then there's a remote possibility that he might be interested in Madison too.  I won't allow that, but I can't watch her twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles went pale; he had never considered that Madison might be a target.  &quot;I'll double... no, triple my security force.  I'll hire a couple heroes as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charles, I said it was a <i>remote</i> possibility, and if you go overboard you're just going to end up scaring her.  I'm the one in his crosshairs right now, especially if he finds out Nick is giving me information on where he's operating.  Just tell your normal security force to be on their guard, and maybe see if you can get them some of the more substantial weaponry that can be bought here.  I have a few contacts in ELITE who can help you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy excused herself then walked back towards Madison's room, hoping to check up on her to see what she was up to.  She peeked into her room and saw the most precious sight; Madison had arranged a little table and chair set, and had some stuffed animals sitting on them.  On the table was a tea set and she was pretending to serve them tea, just like what the grown ups were doing in the living room.  &quot;May I come in?&quot; Cathy asked, and Madison turned to look at her.  Madison's ears perked up, a smile grew across her mouth which showed her pointy teeth, her tail wagged, and her eyes widened at the sight of Cathy.<br />
<br />
Cathy walked into the room. &quot;So, whatcha doin'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm having a tea party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have room for one more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison smiled and nodded, then pushed a chair with a teddy bear down to the end of the table.  She put a cup and saucer in the vacated spot.  &quot;I don't have any more chairs&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's okay, I can sit on the floor&quot;  Cathy replied, sitting down at her spot at the table.  &quot;Did your daddy tell you that you and I are related?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're not my mommy&quot; Madison said with a touch of disappointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know sweetie, but I'm your mother's sister.  That means I'm your aunt.&quot;  Cathy looked Madison in the eyes, and with all her heart added  &quot;That also means from now on I'll always be there for you.  You're very important to me Madison, and I just want you to know that.  I love you very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too aunt Cathy!&quot; Madison said with exuberance, giving Cathy a hug which was returned in kind.<br />
<br />
<br />
***5***<br />
<br />
<br />
After visiting with Madison, Charles, Jessica, and Arthur, Cathy went back down to her apartment and changed into one of her Nightprowl costumes.  She looked at the time and after a light bite to eat headed off to the stakeout point where they'd arranged to meet before they raided the insurance agency.  Frozen Rage was already there, and they began to wait for their arranged teammate for the raid.  &quot;Where is he?&quot;  Frozen Rage asked, looking down on the entrance to the insurance agency.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl had an uneasy feeling in her stomach, as if this raid was going to be different from all the other raids she'd previously been on.  In an half-hearted attempt to lighten the mood she replied with a forced smile &quot;He'll be here... chill out.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to Nightprowl and flatly replied &quot;Groan.  Like I've never heard that one before. Who is he, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl still felt 'off', that something was wrong, but she decided to do her best to ignore it.  She didn't need Frozen Rage worrying about her in the middle of combat.  Forcing the feeling away she nonchalantly answered him. &quot;Some guy. Dunno.  After Nick said he'd talk, a Doctor Theresa Weston contacted me the other day and said that she knew I was checking out the disappearance of Northern Shock.  She said that if a lead looks good to call her because she had a hero who could help.  I asked her why and she just said that she owed it to Northern Shock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a meat shield?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup.  He's kind of a sentient robot.&quot;<br />
<br />
A thump signalled Boxcar's arrival and they both turned to look at the metallic hero who'd landed on the rooftop behind them. &quot;Hey, I heard that!  I'm a cyborg, I'm just heavy on the cybernetics!&quot; he boisterously replied.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl looked over to the new arrival. &quot;Sorry, my mistake.  You must be Boxcar.  Rage, meet Boxcar.  Boxcar, Frozen Rage.  I'm Nightprowl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't a cyborg have to have <i>some</i> human organs though?&quot; Frozen Rage replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I consider a cyborg as part human and part machine, and I am part human.  All my parts are machine, but my mind is human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl curtly replied &quot;Frankly I don't care if he wants to call himself a teapot.  You two quit arguing semantics so we can get to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright, Night?&quot; Rage asked.  &quot;You seem a little snippy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl's mood lightened a bit. &quot;Sorry, I just have a wierd feeling in my gut.  I'm sure I'll be okay once we get into the action.&quot;  She forced a smile out to try and reassure Frozen Rage, then turned her attention to the insurance agency.  &quot;Okay, they're about to close up shop.  Time to step in and see if we can find out what's really going on in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl jumped down into the street followed closely by Boxcar and with Frozen Rage trailing.  They entered the insurance agency and as the door chimed open, the bulky insurance agents rose from their desks in unison.  Boxcar zipped past Nightprowl and confronted the men as Nightprowl strode quickly towards Marina.  &quot;Hi Marina!&quot; she said with a big smile.  &quot;I brought my friends, but dangit, I forgot to call for an appointment again!  I'm such a dumb blonde!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frozen Rage did his part by covering the room in a blanket of snow and ice, making their opponents easy pickings.  Nightprowl grabbed Marina and pushed her face first onto her desk.  &quot;Hey, I give up!&quot; Marina quickly said.  &quot;I'm not a fighter! I don't get paid enough for this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl leaned on her shoulders and spoke into her ear. &quot;I'm feeling nice today, so just show me where the entrance is, and I'll let you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.  There's a button under my desk.  The bookcase over there will slide open, and employees just walk straight through into the research facility.  We're just the door guards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl released Marina and quickly found the button.  A press of the button caused the bookcase to slide open, revealing a steel door.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?  I lived up to my end of the deal.  I can't open it though; each employee has their own passkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get lost&quot; Nightprowl stated, flicking her head towards the doorway as an indication to leave and don't come back.  Marina was happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this it?&quot; Boxcar said with disappointment in his voice.  &quot;I was hoping we could have a <i>real</i> fight.  These guys were pushovers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl motioned to the security door.  &quot;Well, we still need to get by that door, and you'll probably find someone to play with behind it.  I'll let you knock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure&quot; Boxcar replied.  He walked to the door and charged up his fists, letting go several brutal smashes which caused the door to bend, crack, and buckle.  Grabbing a piece of the fractured door he pulled with all his might and the door moaned then gave way.  Boxcar looked into facility to find dozens of guards, security agents, and technicians waiting for them.  &quot;Alright! Now THIS is what I signed up for!  Last one in's a rotten egg!&quot; he yelled, jumping into the fray with reckless abandon.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you thought I was reckless&quot; Nightprowl quipped to Frozen Rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;You <i>are</i> reckless.  He's just plain nuts&quot; he replied with a smile. Nightprowl grinned back.  &quot;Like he said, 'last one in...'.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl joined into the battle, playing off Boxcar's attention generating actions to blindside several opponents.  Frozen Rage used his powers to pester and annoy the crowd, as well as summoning up a frozen companion to aid his defensive posture.<br />
<br />
The trio of heroes had thinned out the attackers into a more manageable group when Nightprowl caught movement out of the corner of her eye.  She turned and looked down the hallway to find a woman looking at her.  Her heart skipped a beat.  &quot;Trish?&quot;  she called out, to which the woman turned and ran into a side room.  &quot;Trish!&quot; she yelled, certain that that was who she had seen.  Without a second thought she broke formation and lept down the hallway to catch up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Night!  Where the hell are you going? Get your ass back here!&quot; Frozen Rage called out while ducking a hail of bullets and freezing an attacker in a block of ice.  Nightprowl ignored him; Rage and Boxcar could handle the rest of the group on their own, and she wasn't going to lose Trish again.  She turned the corner and caught a glimpse of an elevator door closing.  She lept down the short hallway to the elevator and repeatedly mashed the button, as if it would somehow call the elevator more quickly.  Seconds seemed like an eternity as she bobbed her head, urging the elevator to hurry up.  She inhaled and smelled the scent of the person she was chasing; her mind told her it was Trish but there was something different about it, something not quite right about the scent. The doors opened and she slipped in, hitting the down button and mashing the door close button.<br />
<br />
<i>'Why is she running?  What do I say to her? Has she been brainwashed?  Does she even remember me?'</i> The thoughts raced through her mind, though only Trish herself would be able to answer.  The elevator doors opened and she once again saw Trish, running down the hall.  Nightprowl's attention turned to her new problem when Trish slipped past two Paragon Protectors, one male and one female, standing guard in the middle of the hallway.  Trish would have to wait a little while longer, for these two would surely have something to say about letting Nightprowl pass.<br />
<br />
She walked into the center of the hallway and paused, watching Trish disappear through another doorway.  It was time to deal with these so-called 'protectors'.  &quot;Two against one... that's not exactly fair&quot; Nightprowl noted.  &quot;But I don't have time for you to get a few more to even the odds&quot; she quipped with a grin.<br />
<br />
The female answered by sprouting spines from her back and arms, while the male fired an energy bolt.  &quot;Oh, so <i>that's</i> how you're gonna play it&quot; she said, leaping in close and delivering a Cobra Strike to the female's chest, slipping a second energy blast, and firing a solid kick into the male's chest which sent him flying.  She turned her attention back to the female and jumped into the air, firing a powerful kick to her head which sent her staggering.  A flick of her wrist sent caltrops to the feet of the female protector, and after web grenades thoroughly subdued her, Nightprowl then concentrated her attack on the male.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl was a dervish, spinning, sliding, kicking, and deking, and by the time the female protector had freed herself the male was in serious trouble.  He began using the last of his energy to slip and evade even Nightprowl's attacks, and with the female's return the pace of battle was almost too much for Nightprowl to handle.  She turned back to the female protector and annoyed her with more grenades and caltrops. <i>'I have to take this guy down first'</i> she told herself.  She paused and took a deep breath, focusing her mind and body, reciting a quick series of attacks in her head.  She turned to focus on the wounded protector and launched into a ferocious and purposefully precise attack.  He evaded with all his might but Nightprowl was too quick - more blows found their mark than missed, and the protector staggered to the ground and fell, unable to fight any more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now it's just us girls&quot; Nightprowl remarked, brushing her hands together and turning to her final opponent.  &quot;We could gossip about boys, or braid each others' hair... or I could just beat you into a bloody pulp.  I'm more partial to the final option&quot; she said with fire in her voice.  Nightprowl sized up her opponent; she had poisonous spines jutting out from her arms, back, and sides.  <i>'She doesn't have spines in her head'</i>.  That would be the main target of her attacks.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl lept into battle, and the one-on-one fight was well within her limits.  She dodged attack after attack, spinning and driving kicks to the head when the opportunity arose.  A crack began to appear in the Protector's helmet, and Nightprowl flaunted the weakness with repeated strikes.  She jumped up and delivered a punishing blow to the helmet, and it splintered apart as she fell to the ground face first, her flowing hair unfurling from the helmet and hanging over her face.<br />
<br />
Nightprowl stood over her fallen opponent, who was struggling to get back on her feet.  She shakily rose up onto her hands and knees.  &quot;Stay down&quot;  Nightprowl ordered.  &quot;You've lost.  I can end this any time I want.&quot;  The Protector rolled over on her haunches and used a hand to brush her hair from her face.  Nightprowl was stunned at what she saw, unable to understand how she could be seeing it.  &quot;But... but you can't be...&quot; she muttered, letting down her guard and struggling to comprehend the face of the Paragon Protector.  The face of her lifelong friend, Trish Jackson.<br />
<br />
The Paragon Protector didn't hesitate. She lunged at an unprepared Nightprowl and drove a poisonous spine deep into her abdomen.  Nightprowl let out a painful scream and her eyes widened from a sense of shock and betrayal. &quot;You can't...&quot; she muttered, rocking back and feeling another surge of pain as the spine pulled out of her body.  She clutched her abdomen and grimaced in pain.  <i>'Run... Run!'</i> her mind urged, and instinctively Nightprowl took a few uncertain steps backwards, used the last of her web grenades and caltrops to aid her withdrawal, and retreated back towards the elevators.<br />
<br />
She bashed the button with the side of her fist and stumbled into the elevator as the doors opened.  She pressed the 'up' button and noticed it was covered in blood... her blood.  Nightprowl looked down and her right side was bloody, from the bottom of her ribcage down to her thigh. The wound was festering from the injected poison and she felt sick to her stomach.  She was hurt bad.  She keyed her comm, trying to get either Frozen Rage or Boxcar to answer.  &quot;Rage, Box, where are you?&quot;  she painfully asked.  &quot;I'm hurt.  I need backup.&quot;  She got no answer, only static.  The elevator doors opened up and as Nightprowl staggered out she could now see the reason why her teammates hadn't followed her down.  A massive security door had shut behind her, locking her in and them out.  <i>'I'm trapped.'</i><br />
<br />
<br />
***6***<br />
<br />
<br />
All the energy drained from her body and she slumped to the ground.  She propped herself up against the security door at focused on the elevator to make sure the Paragon Protector wasn't coming up.  <i>'It couldn't have been Trish'</i> she told herself.  <i>'But it looked so much like her.'</i>  She unravelled her hand wraps for a makeshift bandage, folding one of them over and over into a large pad to cover the wound, then wrapping the other around her waist to hold the first in place.  <i>'It didn't smell like Trish... not exactly like her.'</i><br />
<br />
She looked up to the ceiling and sighed.  She was trying to regroup and consider her options, though the only one she had was to continue downward.  She had to get past the impostor Trish and find out who was the person she was chasing, the one who got her in this mess.  <i>'You got into this mess all by yourself'</i> she thought to herself.  She knew she'd made a mistake by leaving her group, but there was nothing she could do about it now.  It was then that Nightprowl noticed a security camera fixed on her.  Her eyes went cold and and she rose from the ground with a renewed sense of energy.  With a defiant tone in her voice she stared into the camera and said &quot;I don't know what kind of trick you're pulling, but I'm gonna find my friend and there's not a damned thing on earth that's gonna stop me.&quot;  She entered the elevator and went back down to face the remaining Paragon Protector, the faux Trish Jackson.<br />
<br />
The Protector was still weak from their battle, and with the shock of seeing her friend's face long gone, Nightprowl had the advantage.  This time she was unusually vicious, gritting her teeth and powering kicks into her opponent, punishing the Paragon Protector simply for having Trish's appearance.  She relished every grunt and moan from the Protector, and in Nightprowl's mind the fight ended too early when her opponent succumbed to the punishment she had unleashed.  &quot;Get up!  Get up!&quot; she yelled, her cold eyes locked on her helpless prey.<br />
<br />
Her breath heaved and the thought of delivering the ultimate punishment, death, flashed through her mind.  For a moment she truly considered it, that this cruel imitation of her friend shouldn't be allowed to exist, but her sense of justice pushed that vile thought away.  <i>'That'd make you no better than them, Cathy'</i> she told herself.  Her eyes warmed only slightly from their icy stare as she knelt down over the Paragon Protector.  She took a good look at her face, Trish's face, and noticed something hidden behind her ear.  A small number 38 was tattooed into the side of her head, behind her right ear. <i>'That's so they can tell them apart'</i> she thought to herself.  She left the unconscious Paragon Protectors lying in the middle of the hallway and followed the path of the other Trish, the one who had led her down into this trap.<br />
<br />
Down a hallway and through a door was another elevator; another floor waited for her below.  Nightprowl hoped that this was the last one, as she was tired and a bit lightheaded from the blood she had lost.  She didn't know how much further she could continue.  She was relieved to find nobody waiting by the elevator for her, but while walking down the hallway she noticed that a security camera was panning with her.  She stopped, and so did it. <i>'Not terribly subtle.  They know I'm down here so I may as well make use of it.'</i>   &quot;So, which way should I go?&quot; she asked the camera.  It panned further down the hallway, then back to her.  &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nightprowl walked down the hallway, looking through doorways on both sides which led into what appeared to be research laboratories.  It seemed clear that she was to follow the hallway down to the office at the end, but a feeling came over her, an intuition that she needed to see something else first.  She stopped in the middle of the hallway for a moment and just stood there trying to figure out the sensation she was feeling in the pit of her stomach.  Nightprowl turned and took a step into a laboratory, surveying the room.  It appeared that there must have been all sorts of experiments going on down here, as the computer equipment was still on and she even noticed a half-eaten sandwich as well as half full trash bins.  <i>'This place was cleared out recently and quickly'</i> she thought to herself.  <i>'Maybe as recently as when we breached the hidden door.'</i><br />
<br />
The pit grew in her stomach as she caught a familiar scent mixed in with another scent.  The first was of her lifelong friend, Trish Jackson.  Of that scent she was certain this time.  The second was the scent she feared she would smell.  The scent of death.  She walked into the lab, noting another door on the opposite side.  As she walked towards it both scents grew, as did the pit in her stomach.  <i>'It's her, and she's dead'</i> her mind began telling her, bracing her for the worst.  <i>'I have to be sure'</i> she told herself, striding purposefully towards the opposite door.  As she pushed it open her eyes became glassy and the pit in her stomach felt like it would explode.  Her nose had led her into the research facility's morgue.<br />
<br />
She stood at the doorway knowing that she wasn't going to like what she found, and the urge to turn around popped into her head.  <i>'If I don't find her body, then she could still be alive'</i> she reasoned, though she knew that she was only a few yards from where Trish's cold, lifeless corpse was resting.  Tears silently trickled down her cheeks as she urged herself to continue, to finally end this chapter in her life.  <i>'A bad ending is better than no ending, right?'</i><br />
<br />
Her feet were like lead as she took the first step, her nose leading her past a couple autopsy tables and towards the cooler which housed the dead.  A dozen slide-out tables behind a dozen small doors in the wall.  She opened one of the doors, the one her nose told her housed her friend, and pulled out the tray.  Cathy's heart raced, threatening to burst from her chest, and blood pulsed and throbbed in her head.  She stared down and the black bag on the tray and with shaky hands she began to open it.  The sound of the zipper echoed loudly in the room as it travelled from the top, down the side, and all the way to the bottom before turning and ending at the feet.  All that was left was to lift up the flap, and Cathy would finally find Trish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be her&quot; she whispered to herself as she flipped open the pouch, the stench now stronger and Cathy more certain of what she would find.  She looked down on the corpse and a jagged spasm fluttered in her gut. She couldn't stop herself and she pulled away from the table and retched a dry heave that failed to ease the tension in her stomach. She spat on the floor, and after several calming breaths she returned to the table to look down on her friend.  Tears silently streamed from Cathy's eyes and her mouth quivered at the sight.<br />
<br />
Trish had long since passed away and her body was well on its way to mummification. Cathy stared numbly at the twine stitching in the Y incision from an autopsy done long ago. The pale, fragile, emaciated corpse was beyond any hurt, beyond any pain.  The corpse was naked except for one piece of jewelry, and when she saw it Cathy's hand couldn't help but reach up and touch her own collar.  Trish had given Cathy the collar that she always wore, and in return Cathy had bought Trish a bracelet with a small cat on it.  She remembered back to the day she bought it, and how she argued with the engraver that she wanted it to say 'Friends Forever' even though the small cat was only large enough to have 5 letters engraved on it.  She flipped over the cat and read the inscription: 'CTF4E', which stood for 'Cathy and Trish, friends forever'.  The weight of the moment bore down on her shoulders and she buckled, unable to accept her loss.  She knelt down beside the body and began to sob, curling her hand into the boney, lifeless hand of the corpse, pleading for her to come back.<br />
<br />
Between sobs Trish's voice reverberated in her head.  &quot;Don't cry&quot; it said, and when the words registered in her mind she looked at the corpse in amazement.  &quot;Cat, please don't cry&quot; the voice said once more, and Cathy realized it was real, and it was coming from somewhere else.  She raised her head and looked towards the sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god&quot; Cathy gasped when she saw the figure in the doorway.  &quot;Trish?&quot;<br />
<br />

    <div align="left" id="post_message_254860">Thanks, I'm glad you guys like the series.  The final part of this episode shouldn't take <i>too</i> long to write, as I'm already over half way through it and know pretty much what's in store for it (originally I was trying for one episode but when, as usual, it started to get longer and longer, I broke it up).  Dr. Stevenson will explain everything in the next episode (gotta love those monologuing villains :p), so Cathy Watts will finally know who she is.  Then I've got two things mulling around in my mind for what's next.  I kind of know where the Nightprowl series will go next, but I think I might first write a story about the first night of the Rikti attack.<br />
<br />
It'll follow some of the characters mentioned in the <a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org/viewtopic.php?t=380&amp;sid=2d01f932e925cd8478b2a78a316f0711" target="_blank">'Birth of a Hero: Boxcar'</a> story (Tom, Theresa, and Eugine), and as eluded to in this Nightprowl episode, Northern Shock will fight alongside them as well (that's why Theresa Weston contacted Nightprowl and told her she 'owed it to Northern Shock').  I figure during the Rikti War the critical time was the time between when the Rikti first attacked to the time heroes were able to assembe from around the world to fight back.  The heroes who were in Paragon City when the feces hit the fan knew they were overmatched from the start but had to do their best even in a hopeless situation.  Plus I'll get to kill a bunch of heroes <img src="images/smilies/emote_evil.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Evil" class="inlineimg" />.</div>
