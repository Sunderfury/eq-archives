			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Seriously, I come back after quitting before Pandaria, and for the most part I am enjoying the expansion.<br />
<br />
This aspect however, is completely and totally ********. Honestly, I don't give a **** if it saves them some server space or not, they need to offer the goddamn option to turn it off.<br />
<br />
First of all it gives me horrible latency issues for some reason. Secondly, it is absolutely ****ing terrible trying to level past 50ish on a PvP realm. Yes, I know I signed up for PvP but the problem is certain zones are now open to every ****ing PvP realm now. Most notable among them is Hellfire Peninsula. One single alliance guild from Kil'Jaeden has camped the entirety of Thrallmar for the last 3 days straight (that I know of). So I knew the risk of being ganked by playing on a PvP server, I didn't expect to be open to every person that feels like ganking across every PvP server. I damn sure don't feel like not being able to do jack **** for questing because a guild on an entirely different server feels like it's there job to be complete ****ing dickholes. Third, and while less annoying it's still a pain in the ass, it is annoying as **** having to compete with 15 other people for a small clump of mobs in an area. Blasted Lands was an absolute pain in the ass, I had to actively search for several minutes to find a mob that was alive. In addition to that, sometimes when I come across a rare mob I get close only to find I've phased onto a different realm.<br />
<br />
Let me turn this **** off and go back to leveling alts in peace like I was previously; not having to deal with assholes and actually being able to encounter mobs. Sure it is nice to be able to group with some random stranger across realms for whatever party required quest you might come across, but this **** is seriously not worth the hassle.<br />
<br />
Other than this issue, I'm actually liking the expansion more than I expected to.</div>
