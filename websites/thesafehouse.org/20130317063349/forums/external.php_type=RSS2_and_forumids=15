			<title>Rob Portland: Should a sudden dose of empathy be praised or derided?</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So late yesterday, CNN came out with an interview with Rob Portman, talking about how he's come to terms with his gay son and now supports gay marriage. Prior, he was a cosponsor on DOMA, supported a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, and has otherwise championed discriminatory causes from the right.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/15/us-usa-portman-gaymarriage-idUSBRE92E0G020130315" target="_blank">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/...92E0G020130315</a><br />
<br />
The response from this revelation has been remarkably polarizing and I find it fascinating. Several outlets are pointing out that while it's nice that he's finally joined the right side of history on this one, his lack of empathy until he was directly effected by that discrimination is indicative of the entire conservative mindset (<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/15/1194260/-Sen-Rob-Portman-R-OH-Shows-Us-Exactly-Why-Republicans-Suck" target="_blank">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/0...publicans-Suck</a>), almost dismissing the fact that Portman has made a lot of powerful enemies by becoming the first sitting republican senator to back marriage equality.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm conflicted, I think it's a great gesture, and we shouldn't attack someone for coming around and changing their opinions, but it's also frustrating that he only took a critical introspective opinion of what his actions meant when it directly effected his family. How long would it have taken to change his opinion had his son Will suffered quietly in the closet?<br />
<br />
Edit: typoed the name.</div>
