And now this week you decide to make people really decide and force people to use your stupid Google+ ******** to make comments. I tell you again that I don't want to use my real name, you say OK, and what ****ing happens? My real name is used. **** you and your stupid ********.<br />

Personally the focii seems obvious - timer reduction on executioner disc line as current one does. Clicky I'm also happy with something in the same style. We can't really demand what numbers it should be using - they'll pick something themselves - just what the overall effect should be.</div>
