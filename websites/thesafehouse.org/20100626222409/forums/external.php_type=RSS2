			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Do you lack some Valve in your life? Time to remedy that ****, Steam just put up some crazy deals on games and collections, running now through July 4th.<br />
<br />
<font size="6"><ul><li>VALVE COMPLETE PACK, 33% OFF</li>
<li>CODEMASTER GAMES, 66% OFF</li>
<li>5 INDIE GAMES $19.99</li>
<li>SQUENIX EDIOS COLLECTION, 25% OFF</li>
<li>CALL OF DUTY COLLECTION (CoD6 not included), 75% OFF</li>
<li>2K COMPLETE PACK (Excludes Civ IV), 75% OFF</li>
<li>THQ COMPLETE PACK, 50% OFF</li>
<li>R* COMPLETE PACK, 25% OFF</li>
<li>STAR WARS COLLECTION, 55% OFF</li>
<li>ALL UBISOFT GAMES, 33% OFF</li>
<li>ALL ATARI GAMES, 66% OFF</li>
</ul></font><br />
<br />
2K's games are all on sale by a crapload if you don't want the full pack. Jesus Christ the Squenix Edios pack is crazy cheap in comparison to buying stuff individually, normal prices of $100 vs damn near $600. Still kinda pissed I didn't get in on the Deus Ex sale yesterday.<br />
<br />
Edit: wtf, why do we still have the anti all caps thing going? That title was supposed to be in all caps, forgot to put a lc in there to bypass it  <img src="http://smiliesftw.com/x/mad.gif" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
****, there's also a bunch of Today only sales going on with all this too. Trine is 80% off which means its $4, Killing Floor is 75% off which brings it down to $5. <br />
<br />

If you buy anything that isn't part of the current 1 day special, chances are it will be part of a 1 day special during one of the next few days.<br />
<br />
You might find that you're making good savings with that 33% off game, only to find out a few days later it's 75% off in the 1 day special.<br />
<br />
To play it safe, save all 'sale-long' games until the last day.<br />
<br />
It happened a few times in December's Holiday Sale, and nobody likes losing money like that.<br />
<br />
You have been warned :).

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I guess it's about time to make a World Cup thread, now that USA has for the first time since 1930 won their group in World Cup round robin play thanks to Landon Donovan's injury time goal.  Both England and USA finish with 5 points, but USA gets the group win thanks to the 'Goals For' differential.<br />
<br />
It was a nice breakout goal where the US was able to get a 4 on 2 situation thanks to Algeria pressing for a goal of their own.  Considering what happened in a previous game (the ref unjustly called back their game-winning goal) and earlier in this game (though the goal called back in this game was a true borderline call that could have gone either way) the result was the correct one.<br />
<br />
It should be funny watching The Daily Show tonight, as Jon Stewart and John Oliver have been going at it thanks to USA and England being in the same group.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>IGNORANT ****ING MONKEY*****!<br />
<br />
These are the words I now associate with a cousin that I used to be the best of friends with. Also, they apply to his mother and step-father, my aunt and uncle, as well.<br />
<br />
We'll start off by giving my cousin a name so I can easily refer to his dipshit ass without having to repeatedly mention, and remind myself, that he's family. He's tall, lanky, and has no ****ing brain to speak of so I have chosen Scarecrow as a suitable name for these purposes.<br />
<br />
Scarecrow had a friend who, until recently, was also a general friend of the family. We all knew him, he had been to family gatherings and recently was present when my grandfather passed. As it turns out, Scarecrow's friend is a complete ****ing psycho. He was supplying my then fifteen year old sister with cigarettes, alcohol and drugs. He then proceeded to use this as a blackmailing tool to illicit sexual favors from my little sister.<br />
<br />
As crazy as this may seem, when we found out about this pederast piece of ****'s actions we had him arrested. That isn't crazy you say? That sounds like the completely rational thing to do? Not according to Scarecrow and his parents.<br />
<br />
(I should note that this wasn't my initial resolution for this problem, as 'murdering the **** out of that sorry sack of ****' was the only idea I could come up with... unfortunately my mother and the legal system do not agree with my version of justice.)<br />
<br />
How ****ing stupid can people be? How does the fact that he was your friend warrant acceptance of the fact that he is a creepy stalker son of a bitch that was trying desperately to commit statutory rape against your cousin/neice?<br />
<br />
Yes that's right, he was only sending her messages via myspace and texting telling her he wanted to 'bend her over and **** the **** out of her'. He was only using the fact that our grandfather was on his deathbed as a means to get close to her to further his perverted motives. His myspace only makes it look like he is Ray Finkle and she is Dan Morino in some sort of rape based Ace Ventura. The mother****er only sat outside her school trying to pick her up every day, and later parked himself in my parent's neighborhood and repeatedly drove by the house and called her incessantly. He only violated an injunction that was filed against him and tried to show up at our house when she was by herself (except that she wasn't and the detective that was at our house at the time taking my sister's statement was not amused).<br />
<br />
Yes, you are absolutely correct, this must be my little sister's fault. It couldn't possibly be that your friend is a ****ing piece of **** pedophile.<br />
<br />
Now Scarecrow is sending my mother scathing messages blaming her and my little sister. My aunt and uncle now refuse to talk to us. When we tried to use that crazy little device called &quot;perfectly sound ****ing reasoning&quot; on them and stated all the previously mentioned information on the douchebag, they refused to hear it.<br />
<br />
Now I have made it completely clear to them that I no longer consider them family. While I am a firm believer that family should stick together, the fact that they are such ignorant ****tards and apparently do not feel the same way about family has made me feel otherwise.<br />
<br />
Scarecrow goes so far as to ask for an apology for sending his BFF to prison (where I only hope my vengeance against him is fulfilled by the cocks of angry pedo haters).<br />
<br />
Here's your apology you stupid son of a bitch:<br />
<br />
I apologize that your friend is twenty-six year old perverted headcase. I apologize for seeing him driving down the road and not ramming my car into his and beating the **** out of him with a ****ing tire iron. I apologize for not burning his ****ing house down with him inside. I apologize that he had to go to prison because our country has laws against such things.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned they can go **** themselves. In my mind's eye that branch of the family tree just simultaneously contracted termites, fell off the tree, and caught fire. ****ing idiots.</div>

				If you're in the US, you can now use Google Voice without asking for an invitation. Three years after acquiring GrandCentral, Google finally makes the service widely available.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little over a year ago, we released an early preview of Google Voice, our web-based platform for managing your communications. We introduced one number to ring all your phones, voicemail that works like email, free calls and text messages to the U.S. and Canada, low-priced international calls and more&#8212;the only catch was you had to request and receive an invite to try it out. Today, after lots of testing and tweaking, we're excited to open up Google Voice to the public, no invitation required,&quot; explains Google..........
			
			<hr />
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div><br />
even if you don't need a second number the transcribe voicemail is pretty cool and can be applied to your current phone.<br />
<br />
If you have gmail already you should be able to head to <a href="http://voice.google.com" target="_blank">http://voice.google.com</a></div>
