Cathy sat at the bar, her baseball cap pulled down low and her wraparound shades hiding her face.  Her tail was tucked up under her jacket, making her look like any other normal person.  She slid up her sleeve and looked at her Rolex, a gift from Charles, then quickly decided that she probably shouldn't be flashing expensive jewelery around in this dive of a bar; the last thing she wanted to do was draw attention to herself.  She took a sip of her glass of water and thought <i>'Where the hell is Nick?  He was supposed to be here fifteen minutes ago.'</i> Cathy glanced once more at the front door, waiting for Nick to arrive.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you ready for your new life?&quot; Nick asked without warning, sliding into the chair beside Cathy and taking a sip of her water. &quot;Ugh.  This isn't vodka.&quot;  Nick's saw the surprise on Cathy's face and smiled.  &quot;I came in through the back, and that's how we're leaving.  Let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'He never should've been able to sneak up on me'</i> Cathy thought to herself.  She knew she was taking a huge gamble with this plan, and if she wasn't at her best she was going to get herself caught or killed. <i>'Calm down, Cathy.  Keep your wits and you'll be fine when the time comes'</i> she tried to convince herself. She glanced at the side of his face and noticed his disfigured ear.  &quot;How's your ear?&quot; cathy asked, getting a jab in at Nick's expense.  Nick's cold look told her he'd never forget when Madison bit off part of his ear, which only reminded him of the humiliating defeat Cathy gave him a day later.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine&quot; he replied.  &quot;Now let's go.&quot;  They both got out of their chairs and Nick pulled an electronic device from his pocket. He casually swept it down Cathy's body, then shoved it back into his pocket.  &quot;Checking for wires, tracking devices, or whatever. You're clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed Cathy's bag and began walking towards the back; Cathy followed. They left through the back exit to a waiting cargo van parked in the alley with its side door open. Nick put Cathy's bag in the van then climbed in, sitting on the floor and resting his back against the side of the van. <i>'In for a penny, in for a pound'</i> she thought to herself before climbing into the back of the van and taking a seat on the floor opposite Nick.  Nick tossed Cathy pair of sunglasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already have sunglasses, Nick&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're blacked out.  We're using a transportation system for getting people out of Paragon City without the good guys knowing about it.  I don't trust you and I'm not going to take any chances that you'll tell your hero friends how we do it.  Put them on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy removed her sunglasses and put on the ones given to her, blocking any attempt to see where they were going.  The van began to move and Cathy is jostled by the bumps, unable to tell when they would hit.  &quot;We'll be on a better road soon&quot; the driver said, familiar with his route and the effect it had on his passengers.  They drove for several minutes without anyone speaking a word.  Cathy began to get nervous, uncomfortable with Nick's silence and unable to see what he was doing.  She slid the glasses down her nose and looked over at Nick, finding him staring back at her.  &quot;Push them back up, Cathy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cathy pushed the glasses back up, blinding herself once more, then said to Nick &quot;What've you been doing since they let you out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes.  I've been meaning to thank you Cathy.  Without you finding Joseph's lab I never would have been released from prison.  I owe my freedom to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't mention it&quot; she replied through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I did get a job just after I was let out.  I guess you could say I was kind of a male nurse.  I was looking after a patient at a hospital - she was injured quite badly in an explosion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again the sunglasses dropped down Cathy's nose and she looked over them at Nick's smiling face.  &quot;Bull!&quot; Cathy exclaimed, knowing that he was referring to spying on her while she was in her coma.  &quot;You were not.  Charles, Simon, and Gerry all would've noticed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Put the glasses back on.  You don't need to see me to hear what I have to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. You weren't at the hospital. I would've known.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick turned to the driver.  &quot;Stop the van.&quot;  Both Nick and Cathy swayed and bumped as the van pulled off to the side of the road.  &quot;Glasses on.&quot;<br />
<br />
She thought back to her time in the hospital.  When Cathy awoke from her coma Trish had her head wrapped in bandages.  She remembered seeing other patients with head bandages as well.  If she hadn't been so drugged up at the time she might have recognized Nick's eyes.  &quot;You were a patient&quot; she replied, sliding the glasses back up and feeling uncomfortable with the turn of the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go&quot; Nick said, and the van started moving. &quot;Yes, I was acting as a patient.  My job was to monitor your status.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why were you monitoring me?&quot; Cathy asked, though it hinted to her that Joseph didn't intend to kill her that day, and that he cared whether she would survive.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I've said enough&quot; Nick replied.  &quot;We're almost at our destination.  We'll be stopping soon, and you gotta keep those glasses on until I tell you you can remove them.  Understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was another minute of silence before the van slowed and crept forward, then carefully came to a stop.  Cathy felt the van sway as Nick got up.  &quot;Keep the glasses on&quot; he repeated, then began doing something near the back of the van.  Metal banged and slid against each other, and after a moment Cathy was surprised when Nick grabbed her hand.  &quot;Get up&quot; he said, and led Cathy towards the back of the van.  He changed his grip to her wrist and guided it forward, then cathy felt a metal bar touch her palm.  &quot;That's a rung of a ladder&quot; he said.  &quot;Grab onto it and climb down.  It's about a dozen rungs to the bottom.  There's someone already at the bottom, and I'll be following you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we're still in the van...&quot; Cathy replied, though her nose then gave her a big hint at what was happening.  They had parked the van over a manhole cover and he was leading her down into the sewers through a trapdoor in the bottom of the van.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just climb down.  There's someone at the bottom who'll catch you if you slip.<br />
<br />
Cathy climbed down the ladder, counting the rungs as she went.  At ten she felt a pair of hands at her waist, guiding her down.  She reached the bottom and an unfamiliar voice said &quot;move to the side&quot; then directed her aside with his hands.  Cathy heard the sliding metal again.  &quot;You can take off the glasses now Cathy&quot; Nick said as he climbed down the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
Cathy removed the glasses and found herself in Paragon City's sewer system. &quot;Oh Nick, you really know how to show a girl a good time&quot; she deadpanned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, ain't it quaint.  With your sense of smell you must really be enjoying yourself&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm breathing through my mouth.  Can we get on with it?  The sooner we get out of here, the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow him&quot; he replied, pointing to one of the other men.  &quot;I'll make sure we're not being followed.&quot;<br />
<br />
After ten minutes of walking and several twists and turns Cathy had slowly gotten more and more suspicious of Nick's actions.  He seemed more intent on making sure she didn't try anything than watching behind them. When they finally came to a door with a camera mounted above it, Cathy's senses were on overdrive - her intuition told her something was going to happen and she needed to be aware of her surroundings.  The man leading the way turned around and said &quot;Hey, Nightprowl.&quot; Instead of looking at the man, she first glanced over at Nick and caught him reaching for something behind him.<br />
<br />
It took less than a second for Cathy to react.  She closed the distance to Nick, grabbed his neck with one hand and reached around to grab his wrist with the other.  &quot;What do you think you're doing?!&quot; she yelled.  She glanced back at the other two men to make sure they weren't reaching for anything.  &quot;Get your hands where I can see them!  NOW!&quot; she yelled at them, and they complied.  She turned back to Nick.  &quot;Do you <i>really</i> want to give me an excuse to beat you to a bloody pulp?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to try - he bet me too much money.  Five grand to my $500 that I couldn't tranq you like I did before!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy quickly reached behind Nick and pulled out the object he was going for - it looked like the same tranquilizer gun that he'd used on her in her apartment before she was taken to Belize.  She shoved Nick and backed away to give herself room to move.  &quot;Get over with tweedle dee and tweedle dum&quot; she ordered Nick, motioning him to join the other two men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who bet you too much money?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick shifted uneasily.  &quot;I can't tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you <i>won't</i> tell me.  Just like I <i>won't</i> go any further until I get some answers that will satisfy me.&quot;<br />
<br />
After an uneasy silence, Nick finally spoke.  &quot;Dr. Stevenson.  I still work for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy quickly ran through her mind how she should handle this.  &quot;Yeah, I figured as much.&quot; she replied, confident that Joseph at least suspected she knew he was alive.  She decided to use her 'clone' theory to give something for Joseph to correct in a later conversation.  &quot;I didn't think I killed the real one in Paragon City - he was too young and went out of his way to goad me into killing him.&quot;  She turned to the camera mounted above the door.  &quot;You're watching us now, aren't ya you old fool?  I have a picture of you and my mother that's thirty years old - and I found out Joseph Stevenson was born eighty three years ago.  My guess is you cloned yourself and got him to provoke me to unleash the inner animal that you think is inside me.  Am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Over the intercom mounted below the camera Joseph spoke up. &quot;Hello Cathy.  We've much to discuss but that's for later; we're falling a bit behind.  If you'd be so kind as to give Nicholas his gun back so we can get back on schedule, it would be appreciated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy couldn't believe Joseph's audacity. &quot;That's it?!  I want answers Joseph, and I'm not letting Nick tranq me again.  And you didn't answer my question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn't, and I won't over this intercom. Once you're aboard and regain consciousness, then I will answer your questions to the best of my abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought of Nick once again standing over her while she lay unconscious repulsed her. &quot;I'm not giving Nick the gun.  I don't trust him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't take you aboard the submarine while you're conscious Cathy, rules are rules, so it appears we're at an impasse.  I'm open to suggestions.&quot;<br />
<br />
For Cathy this was the point of no return.  At this moment she could still back out and allow Raymond to explain everything and clear he name, but Joseph would be a constant presence in Cathy's life and the lives of those she loved.  If she followed through now she'd be waking up in an unfamiliar place and with no backup plan, and that was assuming Joseph didn't take the opportunity to lock her away and keep her as his trophy.  <i>'No, he wants me to want to be with him'</i> she reminded herself.  She remembered what Trish had said to her; &quot;He won't lock you up like he did with me.  He was trying to break me - with you he wants to show you that he's a good but misunderstood person.  Your cell will be invisible to you so long as you don't step out of line.  When you do, that's when you'll find out how little freedom you have.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cathy took a breath then exhaled, releasing her tension and commiting herself to continue on with the mission.  She decided to take a direct approach to the problem of being unconscious in Nick's presence.  &quot;I've got an idea of how we can do this&quot;  Cathy replied.  She aimed the gun at Nick's leg and pulled the trigger.<br />
<br />
For a moment Nick just looked down at the dart in his thigh. It seemed to take a few seconds for him to realize what had just happened.  &quot;Dammit that hurts!&quot; He finally yelled, still staring down at the dart in his thigh.  &quot;She shot me!  I can't believe she shot me!  Why the hell did you do that, you damned psycho bi..&quot;  Nick staggered and fell as he lost consciousness.<br />
<br />
Cathy reloaded the gun and pointed it down at her thigh, then pulled the trigger.  She sat down then stretched out on the ground, lying on her back.  &quot;Is this okay with you, Joseph?&quot;  she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, child.  Well done.  These men will treat you with the utmost respect, then they'll return for Nicholas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, whatever&quot; she stated as the drug began to grab hold of her.  &quot;Just so you know Joseph, I'm gonna be majorly pissed if you screw me over.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***2***<br />
<br />
<br />
Gerald lifted his luggage off the carousel, tired from the turbulant flight home and angry about not being there for Cathy when everything went to hell in a handbasket.  Trish had called him in London and told him to come home, but wouldn't say anything else. At the airport he'd caught a news report saying Nightprowl had escaped custody and killed two guards, causing him to swear at the television in disbelief. He knew Trish would have the answers he needed and he wouldn't rest until she gave them to him.<br />
<br />
Trish was waiting for him, and Gerald took no time in getting to the point.  &quot;I need to know what's going on, Trish&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not here&quot; she coldly replied.  With the events of the day, she wasn't in a good mood.  &quot;I'm taking you to meet my boss.&quot;  She turned and began to walk out of the airport, expecting Gerald to follow her.<br />
<br />
He did, and as they walked to through the parkade Gerald asked &quot;Where's Cathy?&quot; in a concerned voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't exactly know&quot; Trish replied.  Trish saw Gerald's surprise when they approached Cathy's Porsche Boxster in the airport parking lot.  &quot;She asked me to take care of it while she's gone&quot; she felt the need to state to Gerald.<br />
<br />
They drove for a while in silence, before Gerald couldn't stand it any more.  &quot;What's going on, Trish?  I don't like being left out of the loop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm really not in the mood for your questions right now, Gerry. You'll know everything soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment Gerald decided to accept that answer, but then chose to speak out.  &quot;No.  I want to know now.  Do you think Cathy's car is bugged? You think someone's following with a secret listening device that can hear us yet somehow drown out the noise of the engine?  You can tell me right now what's going on, but you choose to keep me out of the loop, just like Cathy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish got angry and turned to Gerald.  &quot;I'm trying to keep her from getting killed!  If I want to be cautious it's only because-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch out!&quot; Gerald interrupted and braced himself.  Trish saw the big SUV swerve into her lane and stop, forcing her to slam on the brakes.  The Porsche's front tires dug in and gripped the pavement, rapidly reducing their speed as they got closer and closer.  They halted and rocked inches from an accident.  The SUV had intentionally swerved into her lane and Trish didn't want a confrontation with Gerald in the car, so she flipped it into reverse and glanced in the rear view mirror but saw an identical vehicle quickly rolling to a stop on her rear bumper, blocking her in.  'This is going to get messy' Trish decided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay in the car&quot; Trish said, but before she could get out Gerald grabbed her wrist.  &quot;Let go of me, Gerry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait&quot; he replied, focusing on one of the men in the SUV in front of them.  He let go of her hand and said in a flat voice, &quot;They know you're Northern Shock... they work for Crey... they've hacked the mediport matrix in this area and are going to beat on you until you fall, allowing the mediport to send you right to a waiting cell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish was spooked by Gerald's ability to read the men's minds, but he'd given her enough information to know that she had to come out fighting instead of trying to insist she wasn't a hero.  Trish reached back between her shoulderblades and in a quick flash of red she'd pulled the mask portion of her costume over her face.  In a quick move she jumped out of the Porsche and locked the door before shutting it, preventing them from getting to Gerald without breaking a window.  Electricity crackled around her as she shed her civilian clothes, exposing the red and white costume of Northern Shock.<br />
<br />
<i>'You're going to lose'</i> Joseph's voice suddenly rang out in her mind.  She hadn't heard The Voice in several weeks, but the stress of Cathy walking into the proverbial Lion's Den and the sudden ambush gave rise to the fear and doubt in her mind, the source of The Voice's strength.  &quot;Shut up&quot; she muttered under her breath.  The first man was in melee range before she could get airborne so she charged her hands with electricity and brought down a vicious blow before taking to the air and firing off a finishing shot.  One down, a half-dozen or so to go.<br />
<br />
Northern Shock hovered about ten feet off the ground, out of melee range and ready to fire on anyone who came close. As the Crey agents took cover behind their big vehicles, their tactics began to confuse her.  <i>'What the hell are they doing?'</i> she thought to herself; they'd initiated the confrontation and the instant she showed herself as a hero they backed off.  She wondered if Gerald had been mistaken, but quickly decided that wasn't the case.  Going over the initial confrontation in her mind she quickly came to a disturbing conclusion; this was a diversion.<br />
<br />
Northern Shock looked down the street and spotted a figure clad in blue and yellow flying low and approaching fast.  <i>'A Paragon Protector.  He's trying to sneak up on me.'</i>  She began to aim at the fast-approaching target when she caught movement out of the corner of her eye.  She barely had time to turn before a second Paragon Protector smashed into her,  knocking her out of the air.<br />
<br />
She twisted and bounced across the hood of the Porsche before landing in a heap on the sidewalk.  She grimaced in pain, the salty taste of blood filling her mouth.  She spat crimson onto the sidewalk and yelled at Gerald when the passenger door began to open.  &quot;Stay in the damn car, Gerry!  I promised Cat I'd protect you, and that's what I'm gonna do!&quot;  Before Gerald could say anything she slammed the door shut with her foot, hopped up and took to the air.<br />
<br />
<i>'You're going to lose'</i> Joseph's voice repeated.  <i>'I've got Cathy and soon Crey will have you'</i>.  She ignored the voice, knowing it was just her inner fears taking the voice of the person who had been her captor and tormentor for what felt like an eternity.  &quot;Catch me if you can!&quot; she yelled at the two Paragon Protectors before flying straight up at top speed.<br />
<br />
She glanced backwards at the pair of Paragon Protectors pursuing her and fired a ball of lightning at them.  She then wrapped a tesla cage around one of them, allowing for a bit of separation. After a brief chase and without warning she quickly turned back, charged her fists, and delivered a devistating blow that dropped the second attacker out of the air.<br />
<br />
Northern Shock's satisfaction at the successful strike was short-lived.  <i>'Cathy's wasting away in one of my cells right now.  She's crying out for you - but you're not there for her'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;He hasn't caught her&quot; She replied to The Voice.  &quot;<i>She's</i> going to get <i>you</i>.  I mean him. You're not real, you're just in my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph's voice let out an unsettling laugh.  <i>'You're going insane, child.  They're going to defeat you then they'll put you in a tiny cell and I'll be the only one you'll be able to talk to.  You'll go even more insane.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not insane!&quot; she yelled<br />
<br />
Her mind turned from her conversation with the voice in her head to Gerald and the Crey agents on the ground, so she plunged down to the ground in a freefall, hovering just before she hit pavement.  Gerald had gotten out of the car and was doing his best to against the small army that had been sent to capture Northern Shock.  He seemed to have several paralysed in fear but he was being overrun quickly.  With a flick of his left arm one attacker was vaulted high into the air by an unseen force, and a violent push from his right arm seemed to continue on to another approaching attacker, flinging him backwards down the street.  Northern Shock wrapped Gerald's closest attacker in a field of electricity and threw a ball of electricity into the heart of the group, scattering them and easing that wave of the attack to gain Gerald some breathing room.  They were still in a load of trouble, but it no longer seemed as hopeless as when the attack first began.<br />
<br />
Northern Shock suddenly heard a voice in her mind. <i>'Do a low flyby over these agents, and when the Paragon Protectors get close unleash your nuke on the whole group.'</i>  For a moment she was confused at why Joseph's voice would say that, but then realized it was Gerald speaking to her telepathically.  &quot;It's getting too crowded in here&quot; she grunted; one voice in her head was bad enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
***3***<br />
<br />
<br />
The Paragon Protectors used the mental conversation to their advantage, both getting into melee range of Northern Shock and punishing her with a couple damaging blows.  Northern Shock retreated, knowing her nuke was the only option.  She needed to finish them off now, but if they could withstand her blast she'd be defenseless.  She flew low over one of the SUVs and skimmed over the Crey agents that had surrounded Gerald; he couldn't last much longer either, and this was their last hope.  Northern Shock stopped in mid-air and turned, gathering all the energy from her body to focus it into one massive attack.<br />
<br />
The air around her crackled and pulsed and she held on for one more moment, making sure that everyone was in range.  The pain from being beaten on had allowed the tiny bio-engineered cells in her blood stream to release their stored energy into her body and she knew that this was going to be a thunderous blast.  &quot;Get outta there Gerry!&quot; she yelled, knowing that this blast was going to be a big one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just FIRE!&quot; he yelled back.  With a scream of rage Northern Shock let loose every volt of electricity stored in her body.  In the blink of an eye Gerald vanished from the middle of the group as the stream landed amongst the attackers.<br />
<br />
Store windows shattered, lampost lights blazed, and an overhead transformer blew with a shower of sparks as the mass of attackers convulsed wildly with involuntary spasms.  Unable to muster even the miniscule amount of energy she needed to hover, Northern Shock dropped to the ground and onto her knees.  She bent over with her hands on the ground, clearly exhausted and completely spent.<br />
<br />
She raised her head and her heart sank at the sight of the two Paragon Protectors still on their feet.  They were badly injured, but still standing and ready to finish them off. &quot;No,&quot; she sighed.  <i>'I told you you'd lose, but you didn't believe me'</i> Jospeh's voice rang out. <i>'You're going to be captured, just like I've captured Cathy'</i>  She hung her head in defeat, her psyche shattered by the thought of being captured by Crey once again. In an instant her mood turned.  &quot;No, no, no!&quot; she stated, ignoring the tears welling up in her eyes.  &quot;If I go down, I go down fighting!&quot;  Northern Shock swayed as she staggered to her feet, but found a reserve of energy she never even knew existed.  She took a step forward, then another, then broke into a run straight towards the two Paragon Protectors.  As she charged up her fist for one last strike she realized she was screaming at the top of her lungs.  &quot;EAT LIGHTNING YOU BASTARD CLONE!&quot; she yelled, connecting with a vicious uppercut and sending a Paragon Protector flying backwards.<br />
<br />
She saw movement and glanced over her shoulder at the last Paragon Protector.  It seemed in slow motion that he was rearing back for an attack.  She willed herself to find some miniscule reserve to use against this last foe, but her hands refused to generate any more electricity.  She watched as the Paragon Protector began his attack only to be nailed square in the chest by a column of fire.  He dropped to his knees and keeled over.  Nothern Shock looked around and saw a woman, completely engulfed in fire but planted in a distinct shooter's stance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! He was mine!&quot; she yelled at the woman, the adrenaline rushing through her body refusing to let her admit that she was in no position to finish him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.  You looked pretty well spent. Gerry said you guys needed help.&quot;   <br />
<br />
Gerald seemed to materialize at Northern Shock's side from out of nowhere.  &quot;Yes, we did need help.  Thank you Sam... I mean Fireblossom.  I thought we were done for - I'm glad you got my message.&quot; Gerald replied<br />
<br />
She flew over to the two, extinguishing her flames to reveal a young woman with long, flowing flame-red hair and yellow skin, dressed casually in jeans and a short jacket.  &quot;Aw, Mr. Simms, you know you can call me Sam or Samantha if you want to.  You made me the hero I am today!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You worked hard and made yourself a hero.  Okay Samantha, but you're not my student anymore.  You have to call me Gerry or Gerald.  Deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a deal, <i>Gerry</i>&quot; she said with a perky smile.<br />
<br />
Northern Shock sat down on the curb and massaged her temples, then slid her mask back to let it hang between her shoulderblades. Her mind was overwhelmed with thoughts, the adrenaline began to leave her system, and she felt the nervous breakdown coming to a head.  <i>'Not now, Trish. Not in public. Suck it up.  Deal with it.'</i> she tried to tell herself just like so many other times over the past few months, but she knew this one was different.  She fixated on her hands as they began to tremble. <i>'Stop it.  Stop shaking.'</i> she told herself.<br />
<br />
<i>'I can't do this anymore'</i> she thought to herself, knowing that she wasn't the same person as before she was captured by Joseph.  &quot;I can't do this anymore&quot; she finally said aloud. &quot;I just want to be plain old Trish Jackson again, but I can't.  I'll never be her again.  I'm just a shadow of her.  I'm a fake dreamed up in the mind of Joseph Stevenson.&quot;  She hoped the admission would be some sort of weight lifted from her shoulders, but she just felt sick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you put your mask back on and relax a bit?&quot; Gerald said, knowing that she was supposed to be protecting her identity.<br />
<br />
She stared up at Gerald with sorrow in her eyes.  &quot;Why, so people don't know who I am? I don't even know who I am!  I shouldn't have had so much trouble with these chumps.  The <i>real</i> Trish Jackson - Northern Shock... she would've ground these guys up without breaking a sweat!&quot;  She looked Gerald square in the eye before saying what she'd been thinking ever since she'd put on the Northern Shock costume for the second time.  &quot;I should have been able to handle these guys - I don't have it in me anymore.  I tried, but it's gone... Joseph took it from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't think like that.  You've been through a terrible ordeal and can't be expected to have the same high standards right from the start after you've had so much taken away from you, including your old body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's just it, Gerry!  He made me better!  All the tests I've taken since I was rescued prove that I'm stronger, I generate more electricity, and I can withstand more punishment.  Joseph is an arrogant bastard but he knew what he was doing when he created this body, and that gives me no excuses for why I can't do things today that I could do three years ago when I had an inferior body and inferior powers!  My teammates are all dead and I'm not half the hero I was when I was with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald didn't know what to say, but Fireblossom walked over and stood right in front of her. &quot;Come on. Up!&quot; Samantha said as she pulled Trish to her feet.<br />
<br />
Samantha just stood there for a few seconds, locked into a stare with Trish.  &quot;There is so much bottled up inside you&quot; she finally stated.  &quot;Fear, anger, sadness, and pain. I can see it in your eyes.  You need to let it out, and you need to do it now.&quot; She wrapped her arms around Trish and began to hug her.  Trish was unsure of what was happening; she just let her arms hang down and let Samantha hug her.  Samantha said in a calm, friendly voice &quot;My momma always says 'Don't underestimate the healing powers of a hug'.  Sometimes a person just needs a hug, and I think today you really need one.  Go on, you can hug me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha seemed to exude an infectious warmth of soul from within, and Trish began to hug Samantha back.  For the first time in over two years she let down her guard. Her imprisonment at the hands of Joseph Stevenson.  The doubts her own government had as to her identity, resulting in her current lack of true freedom. Walking on eggshells around Cathy and wondering if Cathy suspected she was attracted to her.  Trish sighed and lowered her chin onto Samantha's shoulder, letting out a breath that had been held for years.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a good sigh&quot; Samantha remarked.  &quot;It sounded like a sigh that removed the weight of the world from your shoulders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least a couple continents, anyway&quot; Trish responded.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problemo&quot; Samantha replied, stepping back and giving Trish a warm smile.  &quot;We may be heroes, but we're also human beings.  Sometimes we need a hug but don't want to admit it.&quot;  She then turned to Gerald.  &quot;While I'm handing out hugs, you're welcome to one too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald smiled and shook his head.  &quot;Thanks for the offer Samantha, but I'll pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should put this back on now,&quot; Samantha said to Trish, reaching out and taking Northern Shock's mask then pulling it back down over Trish's face.   &quot;Gerry never told me he knew Northern Shock&quot; she said.  &quot;I wish I would've known or I would've pestered him to meet you earlier.&quot;  Trish just stared back, wondering whether Samantha was really as innocent and carefree as she seemed.  Samantha's gaze switched from adjusting Northern Shock's mask to looking her in the eye.  &quot;Trish.  Is that short for Patricia?&quot; she asked.  Trish shook her head lightly.  &quot;No, just Trish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm 'Sam', which <i>is</i> short for Samantha&quot; she offered while still adjusting the mask.  &quot;There&quot; Samantha added before extending a finger on each hand in a way that would change the lines of Northern Shock's mask.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Trish asked, puzzled by Samantha's actions and her intent stare, as if she wasn't looking at Trish as a person, but studying the contours of her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The original Northern Shock wore a different costume&quot; she stated.  Samantha studied Trish's face for a couple more seconds before nodding her head and making her decision. &quot;I saw a few pictures of you and the resemblance was remarkable, but wasn't sure.  Same eyes, same jaw line, same lips.  Now that I see you in person, you're just like I remember you seven years ago.  You're her.  You're the original Northern Shock, though it doesn't seem like you've aged a day since then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The original Northern Shock is dead.  I'm a pale copy&quot; she answered, confident that that was the truth.  &quot;What happened seven years ago?&quot; Trish asked, trying without much success to remember meeting what would've been about a fifteen year old walking bonfire with yellow skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so that explains it.  You're having an identity crisis.  I met you at Niagra Falls.  I didn't need to be saved or anything, and to be totally honest I don't know what your team was doing there, but my family was on vacation and my dad said to me 'Hey, look over there!'.  You and the rest of your team were just standing there signing autographs and talking to everyone.  I remember that as I approached you were talking to someone about marinading a chicken and one of your teammates was talking to someone about a maple leaf's chances in the playoffs, which when I asked my dad about it he told me it was a hockey team.  I thought 'Wow, they're heroes, but they're also regular people who talk about normal things'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad asked you if you'd pose for a picture with me, and you did.  I still have the picture.  You were the first hero I ever met in person.  When you had to leave, you rose up into the air and let off an electrical show that had everyone clapping and cheering.  Even before my mutation I knew I wanted to help people when I grew up, and thanks to my mutation, hard work, and Gerry's tutelage, I got to become a hero.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had short red hair... <i>really</i> red hair&quot; Trish replied, remembering that day at Niagra Falls and remembering a girl with hair an unnaturally luminescent shade of red that seemed to glow from within.<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled a big smile. &quot;You remember! Yes, I was going through the first phase of my change - my skin hadn't turned yellow but everyone would comment on my hair.  It's very nice to meet you again, Northern Shock&quot; she said, and gave her another quick hug.  Trish couldn't help the smile that crept into her mouth; Samantha just seemed to have an infectious happiness that made all her problems seem trivial and inconcequential.<br />
<br />
Fireblossom quickly scanned the area for any threats but found none. &quot;Well, I guess you guys don't need me anymore.  You can call me if you need me, Northern Shock - I'd love to work with you in the future.  Gerry, the next time you call me please try to use the telephone if you can - your 'psychic phone call' was really freaky.&quot;  She then lept into the air and hovered before re-igniting herself in flame and gaining some altitude.  &quot;Northern Shock, you gave me a light show seven years ago, so this show's just for you!&quot; she called out before lighting up the sky in flame.  After a smile and a wave, Fireblossom flew off, leaving Northern Shock and Gerald alone.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Cathy awoke groggily.  Her head was still cloudy but she quickly began to take note of her surroundings.  She was on a bed in a small room, and Joseph was sitting in a chair nearby, flipping through a file folder labeled 'Darkprowl'.  He seemed to be patiently waiting for Cathy to fully awake. Noticing her strirring, he put down the folder and asked &quot;Are you doing well, child?&quot;  Cathy quickly brought her hand up to her neck, fearing the worst but thankfully finding only her own collar, her most precious gift from Trish, still around her neck.  &quot;Yes, I'm okay.&quot;  She looked at her hands, then touched her thumbs to her fingers, noting a prickly sensation in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the drug; it has a bit of a numbing effect&quot; Joseph replied.  &quot;Here, have something to eat&quot; he offered, handing her a chocolate bar.<br />
<br />
She scooted up into a sitting position and accepted the offering.  &quot;How long have I been out?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long enough.  We're almost to the Rogue Isles now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy unwrapped the chocolate bar and took a bite.  She stared intently at Joseph, trying to decide how much he expected her to know, and how she should act in a situation like this.  &quot;You look about the same age as the person I killed in Paragon City. You're not a clone, are you?  You're the same one I killed in Paragon City, but you should be dead and buried under tons of rubble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph's smile told Cathy that she'd impressed him just enough while not giving away that she knew he was immortal.  &quot;Yes child, I am the one you killed in Paragon City, and I am the one and only Joseph Stevenson... excluding the deceased infant who's name I took back when I needed an identity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how did you survive?  I broke your neck shortly before you were buried in the explosion that almost killed me.  There's no way you could have gotten out before the explosions destroyed the complex&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm truly sorry about that.  I had not anticipated that you would take Trish with you, so I had not given you enough time to escape.  You had just finished beating her severely, after all.   To answer your question, I didn't get out before the explosions went off, but the explosives for the lowest level of the complex were not triggered until hours later, well after I was gone; I had planned for the explosions to hide your abduction so your teammates would not come to the Rogue Isles looking for you.  When I made the decision to let you stay in Paragon City I still needed to make Crey believe I had died in the explosion; I was going to take Trish with me to the Rogue Isles and you would be the <br />
<br />
<i>'You <b>let me</b> stay in Paragon City?!'</i> flashed angrily through Cathy's mind, but she calmed herself.  <i>'Let it slide Cathy, let it slide.'</i>  She calmly asked Joseph &quot;If you wanted me, then why did you let me stay in Paragon City?  What changed your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did, child.  I thought you were ready, but I was mistaken; meeting you in person I was given the distinct impression that you had not yet been failed by the system you helped to protect.  You clung to it like an infant clings to a blanket.  Had I taken you away you would have clung to the memories even harder and I would have no opportunity to open your eyes to the real world - the world where taking a life can be a good act, and where those who profess to be good and just will kill countless people by preventing the advancement of science.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think I no longer believe in the system I help protect?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do still believe in it, but it's a wavering belief.  Had I taken you months ago you would have closed your mind to my words without even considering the possibility that the system you helped to protect was infallible and my actions meant that I was evil.  It's the same belief that is now engrained into Trish's mind, but thanks to those who now surround her I think I may still have a chance to return her to the fold.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>'This is the second time he's mentioned Trish'</i> Cathy thought to herself.  <i>'He's daring me to ask about Trish, to get angry about his treatment of her.  He wants to explain something.'</i> Cathy wasn't going to play his game so she replied &quot;So you took someone's identity over 80 years ago and you can heal yourself.  How old are you?&quot; but in the back of her mind all she could think of was <i>'What does Joseph know that didn't Trish tell me?'</i><br />
<br />
Joseph smiled and offered up an answer to Cathy's question.  &quot;I'm just over seven hundred years old, though I don't feel a day over five hundred&quot; he replied, venturing a small joke to see if Cathy would bite.  Cathy shook her head but a small upturn in her lips told him that it was well received.  &quot;I was born and raised in Palermo, Sicily.  It's a beautiful place that maybe one day I could show you.  I was just an average Sicilian, but that changed when I began to explore North Africa in 1324.  I was curious about the different cultures in Africa so I went to live there.  Unfortunately for me there was a great sickness that coincided with my arrival at a remote village.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph's mood turned sad as he began to recount the day he was given his immortality. &quot;I was different, so I was blamed for the deaths. The chief of the tribe performed a ritual on me.  I became very sick, I'd cough up blood, my whole body would hurt, and I prayed for death.  Death came, but he refused to take me away.  I would heal almost to the point of feeling that I was healthy, but the plague would return and I would fall ill again.  I did the only thing I could think of, I travelled home to find some sort of cure.  Those who helped me out of the kindness of their heart were rewarded with the plague and with death.  I ended up killing so many people.&quot;  Joseph sighed heavily.  &quot;But now that's neither here nor there... what's past is past.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy began to understand Joseph's complete disregard of ethics in is experimentation; he had killed hundreds of thousands with the plague he carried back home, so an individual's hardship was nothing if it meant scientific progress to understand why people were dying.  Over the years that belief had affected how he went about his experiments; a sacrifice of one for the betterment of many was always acceptable in his mind.  &quot;I'm sorry to hear that&quot; she commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a long time ago.&quot; Joseph said, brushing it off. He picked up the Darkprowl folder from the table and thought about what information Cathy might trade in return for the opportunity to read it.  Joseph ventured into new territory, asking Cathy about her past.  &quot;Since I've just told you about my past, I was hoping that you'd answer a question I have about your past.  It's about Todd Winslow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy immediately turned cold.  &quot;No&quot; she bluntly replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I haven't asked the question yet.&quot; he said with a uneasy grin, trying to appear friendly but now fully realising he had brought up a topic that had completely destroyed any gains he had earlier made.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's off limits.  Period.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph pressed on, speaking calmly in hopes of being able to break through.  &quot;According to the information I aquired, the prosecutor intended to link you to his accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you know about his accident, then you've read my statement to the police.  It hasn't changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just trying to understand why he would bring it up.  If you could tell me more about that weekend...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy gritted her teeth and replied &quot;I said 'no' and I meant it.  I would very much like to read Darkprowl's folder, but if the cost is Todd then you can leave right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph paused then gave a pained smile of acceptance. &quot;I'm sorry Cathy, I had to try.  I hope some day you feel you can trust me about him, but I will not force it from you.&quot;  Joseph handed the folder to Cathy. &quot;I must warn you though that it has some very graphic pictures that might be upsetting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can handle it, Joseph.  These eyes have seen a lot of bad thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph leaned over and took Cathy's hand. He lightly touched three points on the back of it.  &quot;These carpal bones were replaced and used as points for her claws to puncture the skin.&quot; He traced three lines from the back of her wrist to the first knuckle of each of her three middle fingers.  &quot;They made incisions here to accommodate her large claws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was used as a trial run for an experiment that was to be done on another subject, only she escaped before they had a chance to finish studying her.  Their goal was simply to go over the procedures to streamline the operation, and to see if the measures used to reduce the possiblility of infection and sterilize the metal were going to present a problem during the final operation.&quot; He turned her hand over, exposing her palm.  He ran his finger down the length of Cathy's forearm.  &quot;Her entire forearm was sliced open and her ulna and radius bones were replaced.  Between her fingers and her elbows most of her skeleton is made up of an experimental metal, the same metal used for the blades of her claws.  A guard bar was inserted alongside her humerous bone to prevent a side attack from breaking her upper arm.<br />
<br />
She's had the claws for almost ten years and has yet to damage them.  In Darkprowl's folder there are many photos of the operation.  If you see those photos you probably won't be able to look at her without seeing her lying unconscious on an operating table with her arms sliced open and her forearm bones removed; I know I can't.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's horrible&quot; Cathy replied.  &quot;But I thought she was your creation.  She's not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heavens no! I would have euthanized her at birth had she been born in my care.  She was a total surprise for me.  She was made in the same way I created you, unfortunately the scientists who created her didn't take all the precautions I did and they ended up with a semi-intelligent beast.  One of the people who works for me in the Rogue Isles saw her fighting at a shady gambling operation and knew that I was well versed in genetics, so he described her to me.  I went to check her out and bought her from her owner. I named her Darkprowl after you. 'The Deadly Cheetahwoman' might have been fine for a circus performer, but not as someone who will bring fear to the hearts of my enemies.<br />
<br />
Later genetic tests confirmed my suspicion that she does have your father's DNA and using my old russian contacts I found out information on her operation, but she was given to them by another research project which no longer had any use for her.  She wears a chain around her neck that if you notice closely has a tag which reads 'TA-735'.  That number doesn't correspond to any of the russian experiments, so somebody destroyed all the records of her birth and youth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You <i>own</i> her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that disappoint you?  She was literally being worked to death in the fighting arena, and in her condition she probably wouldn't have lasted more than a few weeks on the streets.  As her handler, Nicholas is given a weekly stipend which is allocated to her needs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it makes me wonder what you consider <i>me</i>?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I consider you a bright, intelligent woman and one of my finest achievements in genetic experimentation.  I intend to put you to work as an important part of my operation, Cathy.  I hope you didn't think you were coming to the Rogue Isles for a vacation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, of course not.  But I won't kill for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've nothing to fear, child.  You've made that point abundantly clear, and if that's your only stipulation then I agree that I will never force you to kill another human being.  You'll become my second-in-command and take over some of <i>my</i> duties, freeing me up to concentrate on my experiments.  Over the past few months I've been rather swamped and look forward to you being able to ease my burden.  You'll be doing paperwork similar to what you did when you ran your fitness club The Nightprowler, though on a larger scale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just paperwork?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just paperwork.  No strings attached.  I hope that you will become my employee, and I do remember what I told you before; if you join me you will be well taken care of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe the exact words were that I would be 'treated as a goddess'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, so it was, and a goddess you shall be.&quot;  Joseph rose from his seat and sighed.  &quot;I however have some godly obligations I must attend to before we arrive in the Rogue Isles , so if you'll excuse me...&quot;  He knocked on the steel door, and as the guards on the other side opened it he said to Cathy &quot;I'll have them bring you a hot meal shortly - I hope you'll be able to tolerate these confined accommidations for the remainder of the trip.  Your suite in the Rogue Isles will be much more luxurious.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***5***<br />
<br />
<br />
Trish smiled a smile that only minutes ago would have been unthinkable.  She had reached the breaking point and was ready to give up being a hero, but the right person was there to calm her and make her feel unlike she'd felt for years.  &quot;Fireblossom... Sam.  Is she <i>always</i> like that?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Gerald nodded. &quot;Yeah.  She's definitely a free spirit.  I've yet to see anything discourage her from simply trying harder to achieve her goals.&quot;<br />
<br />
The despair she'd felt had been washed away by Fireblossom's youthful exhuberance, and Trish began to think about Fireblossom as a hero who could be of use to her. &quot;How powerful is she?&quot; she asked Gerald.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's very powerful.  Of all the students I've helped, she's in the top three in terms of her raw potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how is she with keeping secrets?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She won't reveal your identity to anyone. She's very trustworthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish turned her attention to the remnants of the fight.  &quot;I've got to call my boss and tell him what happened.&quot;   She gathered her civilian clothes and tossed them in Cathy's Porsche then took the phone from her coat pocket and phoned Raymond.  &quot;Sir, we've got a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald scanned the area while listening to Trish's half of the conversation in the background. &quot;Yeah, he's with me right now...  We were ambushed... Gerry said they were after me, not him.  He said they knew who I was...  About a dozen of them. Yeah, I'm okay; the cells in my blood seemed to work decently enough...  Okay, we'll see you soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sat back down on the curb and looked up at Gerald.  &quot;Ray will be here shortly with a team.  We're supposed to wait for them&quot; she told him.  After waiting for a while and going over the battle in her mind, she thought about what Gerald had done during the fight.  &quot;You did pretty well in the heat of battle. For someone who doesn't consider himself a hero, I'm impressed at how well you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just like riding a bike...&quot; Gerald replied, absentmindedly revealing a part of his hidden past.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?  You've done this before?&quot; Trish asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I used to have a lot more power...&quot;  He touched his hand to his upper lip and was puzzled by what he <i>didn't</i> find.  He turned to Trish and asked &quot;Is my nose bleeding?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... wait, there's a bit there, but nothing much.  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was using my powers so much during the fight that I should've been pouring blood from my nose and eyes.&quot; he replied. <i>'The curse - it's weakening.  I'm starting to get my power back.'</i><br />
<br />
&quot;You look fine - just a bit of crusty blood right in your nose there, no big deal.&quot;  Trish paused for a moment before adding &quot;I didn't know you could teleport.  When did you learn that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you and Cathy were blown up during your rescue.  Frozen Rage told me Cathy was hurt badly and something happened in my mind - I don't know what it was. I was at our apartment and felt the overwhelming need to be at the Talos tram, and all of the sudden I was there.  Later I started practicing and have gotten rather good at it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You care about her a lot, don't you?&quot; Trish suddenly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you&quot; Gerald answered back.<br />
<br />
Trish couldn't deny it and didn't reply.  She thought back to 'the kiss'; Cathy didn't seem angry that she'd kissed her, but Cathy didn't exactly profess her love for her either.  It could've been that Cathy didn't feel the same way about her as she did about Cathy, or it could've just been the wrong time for that discussion.  Trish just knew that she had to put her feelings out in the open before Cathy went to the Rogue Isles, and before Cathy chose Gerald over her.<br />
<br />
They sat there for a few moments in silence.  Trish then took a look at Cathy's Porsche.  The side mirror was broken off and the hood was scraped and dented from where she slid across it. &quot;Aw, man!  Just look at her car!  Cat's gonna kill me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think given the circumstances she'd choose you over her car&quot; Gerald replied.  The sentiment warmed Trish but it brought doubt into his own mind.  <i>'She'd choose Trish over her car, but what if she had to chose between us?  Would she choose me over Trish?'</i><br />
<br />
Trish realized the last time she heard from Joseph's voice was just before Fireblossom had flown in and finished off the two Paragon Protectors. <i>'The second I'm out of trouble you disappear, you coward'</i> she goaded it, but there was no response. She looked at Gerald and tried to explain herself. &quot;Sorry I went a bit... nuts.  I've never let my circumstances get to me before now, and it just overwhelmed me for a moment. It won't happen again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean this was your first breakdown since you were rescued?  If so then I'd say it was a long time coming.  If you want somebody to talk to then I'm a good listener.  We've got more in common than you might think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish wasn't sure what to make of Gerald's comment, but took the offer.  &quot;The people I work for don't even think I'm her - Trish Jackson, Northern Shock.  Most of the people I knew before I was captured have died, moved on to other assignments, or retired when the Northern Guard was killed.  Some of the internal documents either call me a clone outright or put the roman numeral 'II' in brackets after my name.  I have a curfew, supposedly for my own protection, and I've got a tracking device embedded in my arm, again supposedly for my protection.  I'm no longer doing any serious scientific work; I'm just a grunt who goes and hunts down whoever or whatever they tell me.  I know I have super powers, but I've always been a scientist at heart and now they don't even trust me with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did Cathy say when you told her about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I lied to her.  I've been telling her everything's been going great, couldn't be better, happy to be back fighting crime, etc.&quot; Trish replied. &quot;If she knew what it's really like she would've confronted Ray about it, and Ray would've just escorted her from the building and revoked her clearance.  She's been the only thing in my life still grounding me.  If I lost her... I don't even want to think about it.  I don't know what I'd do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could talk to him.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Would he listen to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You and I have known each other since before the war; I can vouch for you.  I think I can convince him you're just as valuable as a scientist as you are a hero, and he'd be wasting his potential resources if he doesn't use you to your full potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That must be my problem - I've been thinking of myself as a person, not a resource.&quot; Trish caught the look from Gerald and regretted what she'd said.  &quot;I'm sorry, I know you're trying to help. I'd like it if you'd talk to Ray for me.  Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The conversation paused, Trish thinking about how she'd been changed by the war and her captivity.  &quot;You know what scares me?&quot; she said.  &quot;What really scares me is that when I die, I'm going to stand in line at the gates of Heaven and I'll tell St. Peter my name. I'm afraid he'll look down at his list, look back up at me and say 'I'm sorry, but I can't let you in.  You're already here'.  I've had nightmares about that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I sometimes question whether I'm really alive, or whether I'm just a shadow of someone who's already dead.  Cathy's the only person I still have in this world. I can't go back to my family - to them I died years ago.  Now Cathy's with the one person who I know can seriously hurt her if he chooses to do so.  He can hurt her to the point of changing her forever, just like he changed me.&quot;  Trish turned and looked Gerald straight in the eyes.  &quot;I think she may be in over her head with this mission.  I should've gone instead of her, but my handlers wouldn't let me - they don't trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Everything will work out, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish turned the conversation away from her fears.  <br />
<br />
While Gerald was worrying about who Cathy would choose, Trish was thinking of why someone would attack her and who knew who she was under her Northern Shock costume.  &quot;They must know he's alive&quot;  she stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who knows what?&quot; Gerald replied, puzzled by the statement.<br />
<br />
Trish glanced around to make sure nobody was within earshot.  &quot;Crey.  They must know Joseph is still alive.  That's why they were after me, and that's why they tried to kidnap Cat this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joseph Stevenson is alive? Wait a second - Crey tried to kidnap Cathy?!  When were you going to tell me that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was an unexpected part of the plan, but they failed.  Crey planned for those 'Nightprowl Escapes!' articles to cover her abduction by them, so it forced us to launch our plan early.  Crey must want something that Joseph stole from them. They probably found out that Joseph was still alive and needed a bargaining chip to force him out of hiding.  Like it or not, Cat and I were both created by Joseph, and he's very possessive about his creations.  They messed up with Cat, so I was next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long has she known that Joseph was still alive, and why didn't she tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She just wanted to protect you. She had to get you as far away from Paragon City as possible, both to make you a less attractive target and to trick Joseph into believing you two were having relationship troubles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We <i>are</i> having relationship troubles, and this is part of the reason.  I don't need protection; I can take care of myself just fine.  I need her to trust me like she trusts you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She trusts you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she?  I don't think she's ever forgiven me for invading her mind while she was in her coma.  I thought I was doing the right thing.  She trusts you enough to tell you everything, but she had me sent away to England instead. She doesn't trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish found herself in an awkward situation.  She wanted Cathy for herself but knew Cathy would never forgive her if she didn't defend her decision not to tell Gerald.  &quot;Right or wrong, she did what she did to keep you out of harm's way - she told me that herself.  I think once this is over the three of us need to sit down and talk - put everything on the table and accept whatever comes out of it.  One of us is going to get hurt, but it's the only way to be fair to each other.&quot;  Trish recognized the vehicles that turned onto the street and approached.  &quot;Here comes Ray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald thought about what he'd heard while trying to telepathically talk to Trish, and decided he'd better bring it up before the reinforcements arrived.  &quot;Do they know about the voice you're hearing in your head?&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned to look at him, her face full of concern at Gerald's statement.  &quot;You can't tell them&quot; she pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not normal; you've given it its own sound and personality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I haven't.  It's not an imaginary person, it's Joseph's voice and personality.&quot; Trish paused at her admission.  &quot;Now you <i>really</i> know how badly he screwed me up.  When he copied my brain into this body I think he put some extra stuff in as well - part of his own mind.   I hadn't heard it for weeks until today - the stress must be getting to me.  It'll settle down after Cat's plan works and she comes back safe.  This whole thing - you being sent to London, Cat getting in trouble with the law - it was all planned out well in advance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raymond Stellar got out of the vehicle and looked over to the two of them.  &quot;You can't tell them, Gerry.  Promise me you won't tell them.&quot;  She glanced over at Raymond, who was approaching them.  &quot;I'll tell you everything about the plan later, even the stuff that Ray can't.  Just don't tell him about Joseph's voice in my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raymond approached Trish and Gerald.  Gerald reluctantly nodded at Trish.  The two stood up as Raymond walked up and offered a handshake to Gerald, which was accepted.  &quot;Well done, Northern Shock&quot; he said.  &quot;This is Gerald Simms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I was about to tell him why Nightprowl went to the Rogue Isles, if I may?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it would be better to discuss the plan in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald spoke up. &quot;I'd like to know now.  I don't care about all the intricacies of the plan, I just want to know why Cathy didn't tell me what she was doing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Trish answered Gerald's request without asking for Raymond's permission. &quot;Nightprowl is going to the Rogue Isles to kill Joseph Stevenson, once and for all.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***6***<br />
<br />
<br />
Joseph walked down the narrow corridor of the submarine then entered the security room to find Nick staring at a monitor and Darkprowl curled up in a ball in the corner, purring quietly. Joseph noticed that the monitor was displaying the feed from the hidden security camera in Cathy's room.  &quot;Nicholas, you seem rather obsessed with Cathy.  What is it that draws you to her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not drawn to her, I hate her&quot; he replied angrily.  &quot;Sooner or later she'll slip up, and I'll be there to catch her.  She's going to betray you Joseph, and I'm going to stop her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph smiled a knowing smile.  &quot;Of course she'll betray me; she is her mother's daughter after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that Cathy has come to the Rogue Isles to kill me, and that she will use a special dagger which is being brought to the Rogue Isles by others. I should have about a week to work on Cathy before she makes the assassination attempt.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If you know she's going to try to kill you then just throw her in a cell when we get to the Rogue Isles!  Don't give her a chance to do it, and don't give her a chance to escape!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not create Cathy so she could waste away in a cell as my prize.  She is an assassin; that is what she was created to be.  When I am done with her she will come to realize that the Rogue Isles is the only place for a person like her.  I intend to open her eyes to what she really is, even if it kills me.&quot;<br />
<br />
