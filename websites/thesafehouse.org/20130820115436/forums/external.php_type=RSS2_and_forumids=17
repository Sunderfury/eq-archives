I have one 1920x1200 monitor, and may try going to 2 some time in the future, but hoping to run just the one card, rather than doing a dual-sli.<br />
<br />
Any opinions on the setup would be appreciated.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>All right, so there is this company, Portrait Innovations, that my wife had our 3rd (yes, third....we are all now this old) girl's one-year pictures taken.  She paid extra for a CD of pictures, assuming we would be able to actually do something with the CD.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is they put a much lower-quality jpg file onto the CD, which we can't have reprinted the size we need.  Also on the CD are what appear to be the original files- they are in &quot;pi2&quot; format....unreadable from anything I've got.  I've tried downloading different viewers and converters with no luck.  From searching online, it appears this is an encrypted file, only able to be read by Portrait Innovations software....ie, if you want more prints, you have to pay them.<br />
<br />
I am no longer tapped into the world where I know there are hacks or copies of this software floating around.  So I come to you Safehousers, wondering if any of you are still tapped into this world and can help me out.  I'm attaching a sample file if it helps at all!</div>
