<br />
<a href="http://www.gigabyte.us/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4140#ov" target="_blank">Gigabyte GA-Z77 Mobo</a><br />
8 GB RAM<br />
GTX 550 Ti<br />
i5 gen 3 3.4GHz<br />
and a 550 watt PSU<br />
<br />
What I would like to do is upgrade my PSU, RAM and video card. As well as get a SSD for that slot on the mobo and perhaps upgrade to Windows 8 and migrate the OS to it. For the PSU and video card updates, I'm thinking:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0406089" target="_blank">750 watt PSU</a><br />
<a href="http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0416464" target="_blank"> GTX 760</a><br />
<a href="http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0406437" target="_blank">and a 128 GB SSD (SanDisk ulta plus</a><br />
<br />
Any idea of this is a reasonable upgrade, or should I perhaps be looking at other parts/combos? Is the SSD/OS move worth it? Any tips would be great. Thanks guys!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>OK, so at my job we send info out to our field people via text message automatically.  It's all handled in our database back at the office.  The problem we come up against is that if something is pushed out to someone and it is their day off or they called in sick, that text message that they need to respond to goes unanswered.<br />
 <br />
So, we need a way for the people in the field to set up their texts to be auto-forwarded to a different number when needed.  Anyone know if this is possible?  I see a few apps that say they do similar things, but not having an android phone to test this on(I use an iPhone, but our field personnel use Galaxy S3s,) I don't know what to recommend.<br />
 <br />
So I turn to you all for help!<br />
 <br />
