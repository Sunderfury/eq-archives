		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I've tried to play as a rogue a few times, but I just couldn't find the motivation.  So after perusing the web i found this place.  That coupled with a few conversations with friends have peaked my interest once again.

The only thing is that i cant get my talent tree quite right.  I want to cause as max damage as fast as possible, but i dont want to be solely position dependent.  Any and all help is welcomed.

Also what should i invest my points in first?  I think that i should go for Imp. SS but im not too sure.]]></description>

		<title>A little help required ....</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Hello fellow rogues I wonder if I could trouble you for a little help please.  I've had a look through some of the previous posts but they seem to be a little out of date with regards to the rogue talents as they are at the moment.

My rogue is just an alt for me but I have a lot of fun playing her (not quite as much as my mage though!), a few people have commented recently on my talent build and what it's missing but they all seem to have different views.

When levelling her up from 0-60 I remember trying both assassination and combat builds but neither one really stood out for me so i'm hoping that if I tell you how I play hopefully someone here can guide me in the right direction.

Well i'm on my way to 70 now (currently 62 almost 63) I tend to solo her mostly but also enjoy doing instant runs.  I tend to favour daggers but people tell me swords are better for soloing.  I don't PvP so the build must be very PvE friendly.  I take pride in the fact that I play all my characters to the best of my ability and i'm just wondering with the rogue if i'm not doing enough talent wise as although I understand some of the must haves i'm rather baffled by the rest.

Your help would be very much appreciated and I thank you in advance :)]]></description>

		<title>PvP and druid duo PvE rogue</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Hello all. I am planning on doing pvp and duoing to 70 with a druid friend. Can you all take a look at the build i am thinking about and let me know what ya think? It looks fun but i played a warrior to 60 and the specs for wars are much more clear cut to me. I am aiming for big and plentiful crits, and plenty of combo points to go around.

		<title>Looking for a good combat sword build.</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Long story short, I'm level 70 with some build that I randomly thought looked good. It's more geared towards daggers right now, but I want to go back to sword. I just have more fun with combat swords. Positioning gets annoying. So here's my questions.

1. Is combat swords only good for levelling, or can it be a good thing to go with for higher level five mans and end game raiding?

2. What is a good way to spec for combat swords? Im not so much worried about getting big numbers. I just want good, steady, high damage overall. 

Thanks for any responses.

		<title>Lockpicking 280+</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Ive not seen anything about this here yet, so I hope I'm not wasting your time.

I've googled &quot;wow lockpicking guide&quot; and followed most links and I seem to get the  standard everywhere I go. Most guides take you to 280, telling you to unlock  BRD or scholomance doors till 300, but it doesnt matter because once your 280, you can open anything.
Not so, thanks to Burning Crusade, and a recent patch.

The patch puts you out of commission if you keep resetting brd to lockpick the doors after about 5 times. At that point, your out of BRD action for 8 hours.

As for TBC....anyone got any clues for lockpicking?]]></description>

		<title>Combat potency</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[I have heard about a million conflicting schools of thought on combat potency, but my main question is......

PROCS PER MINUTE OR FLAT % CHANCE??!?

everyone is going for fast off-hands like there is no tomorrow but that dosn't mean it actualy is PPM. 

If no one here knows FOR SURE, I'll grab a logger and parse it out, hate to pull the lazy card but I've had a TON to do since I hit 70 and the guilds been quite busy. Anyway thanks in advance ~

		<title>Thoughts on a pointless experimental Rogue build</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Lately, I've had this really weird idea of trying to make a tanking rogue. (Tanking in the sense they can take a beating, not hold aggro) Yes, its an oxymoron of an idea. I'm interested to see if being tougher would balance out the massive loss of DPS and make for effective rogue play. I've seen a decent amount of +Def leather, tanking trinkets, and tanking weapons, and combined with the righ talents in subtley, I think it might work. Thoughts?]]></description>

		<title>Is it worth it?</title>
		<link>/showthread.php?t=$thread[threadid]&amp;goto=newpost</link>
		<description><![CDATA[Hi again fella's currently i have been working with a cold blood, imp ambush, initiative build, im 49 with http://www.thottbot.com/?i=9247 (widowmaker) in MH (with +4 damage enchant) and http://www.thottbot.com/?i=7245 (shadowblade) in OH. 

Now with that all said and done i have generated enough honour for a lobotomizer, but the issue is that most greens from burning legion compare to this dagger, so should i continue to grind the honour to get the grand marshal's dirk? The reason i think this is that i doubt im going to get any decent daggers in the 50's range to compare with the advantage i currently have at 49. so basicaly my question is is the grand marshals dirk worth the time because i researched other potential high damage MH and this seems the most obtainable for a solo person like me.

I just don't want to grind BG for a couple of months( T_T yeah months because of alliance always losing) and find out my research was wrong and a comparable MH could be achieveable by just getting to 63.

well thank you for your time, happy gaming]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems every time I respec I pick the wrong skill or one of my kids mashes the mouse, or something and I have to redo (oh for an undo option).  Anyway I digress..

I'm a dagger rogue and I love it.  I only PvP occasionally, before the XPAC I'm doing a bit more to snag one the the GM daggers.  I raid with my guild (MC, Staring BWL, etc.)

What would be a good dagger build for Leveling and still being useful on raids?  I'm mostly assassination now. Would Combat be better?

Thank you.]]></description>
