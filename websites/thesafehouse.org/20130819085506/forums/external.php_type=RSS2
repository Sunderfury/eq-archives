Anyone have any input?  I am tempted to get the $300 compressor and airbrush combo kit, but that is a lot of $$$ for no more than what I currently use the one I have (base coating, minor shading etc).<br />

Anyone have any ideas?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>All right, so there is this company, Portrait Innovations, that my wife had our 3rd (yes, third....we are all now this old) girl's one-year pictures taken.  She paid extra for a CD of pictures, assuming we would be able to actually do something with the CD.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is they put a much lower-quality jpg file onto the CD, which we can't have reprinted the size we need.  Also on the CD are what appear to be the original files- they are in &quot;pi2&quot; format....unreadable from anything I've got.  I've tried downloading different viewers and converters with no luck.  From searching online, it appears this is an encrypted file, only able to be read by Portrait Innovations software....ie, if you want more prints, you have to pay them.<br />
<br />
I am no longer tapped into the world where I know there are hacks or copies of this software floating around.  So I come to you Safehousers, wondering if any of you are still tapped into this world and can help me out.  I'm attaching a sample file if it helps at all!</div>

I'm rolling an Elezen Marauder on Cactuar, name is Spinozeaux Belhumeur. I'll update this post with names/servers.<br />
<br />
<b>We have a linkshell; it is named &quot;The Safehouse&quot;.</b> Apparently not cross-server, though, so this is just on Cactuar.<br />
<br />
SnibbsQ: Spinozeaux Belhumeur on Cactuar<br />
Jaesin: Gigas Socks on Balmug<br />
Tivia: Tivia (? maybe) on Adamantoise</div>

So anymore fellow returning or veterans still running around? :)<br />

Oh yes, I would like some help on setting macros too. What are the essentials? I remember I used to have a duck out of combat macro, an assist main tank, a start combat with BS (probly share with the BS macro, yes?), and one for practicing pickpocket.  Can anyone please help to fill in memory? Thanks!</div>
