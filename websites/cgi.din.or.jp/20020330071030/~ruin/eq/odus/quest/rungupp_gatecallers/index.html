の最後、Vasile Jahnirの台詞から始まります。

Vasile Jahnir says 'You have mastered these spells quickly. You
shall now wear the Gloves of the Gatecaller. Cumbersome they
may feel, but they protect the hands of a young magician. In your
young days of magic they will protect you from harm. They are not
valued much by merchants, but they are prized by other circles,
but we offer them to only our young Gatecallers. You may now be
of assistance with a [slight problem].

You say, 'what is slight problem?'

Vasile Jahnir says 'We have heard rumor of an Ogre who has
taken residence within the forest of Toxxulia. During your travels
within Toxxulia we command you to keep a watchful eye out for
the beast. Slay it on sight and return the Head to me. To do so will
earn you the spell Fire Flux or Burn. Whichever may be available
at the time.

Vasile Jahnir says 'So the rumor shows true. Good work. You are
an excellent student and a noble Erudite. Here is your spell as I
promised. Go forth and fill your brain with knowledge.
<br>
Your faction standing with GateCallers got better
<br>
Your faction standing with HighGuardofErudin got better
<br>
Your faction standing with HighCouncilofErudin got better
<br>
Your faction standing with Heretics got worse
