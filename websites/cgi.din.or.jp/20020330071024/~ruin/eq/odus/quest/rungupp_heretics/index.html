Hereticsの小屋の中の
NEC GM Marzus Demsion
に話し掛けることで始まります。

ちなみに、WIZ(LV9、HereticsのFaction下げまくり)で
おとずれてやってみたら会話の途中でいきなり殺されました(w。

<blockquote>
<font size=-1><b>
<font color=#000000>
You say, 'hail Marzus Demsion'
</font>
<br>
<font color=#888888>
Marzus Demsion says 'You have entered the private sanctum of the Heretics.
If it is a battle you wish, then do so.
If you [study the art of necromancy], then we welcome you.
</font>
<br>
<font color=#000000>
You say, 'I study the art of necromancy'
</font>
<br>
<font color=#888888>
Marzus Demsion says 'Continue your studies.
Do not be as most and shun the most powerful circle of magic.
If you are a skilled at the art then you should be weary of all Erudites
within Erudin and if you are an apprectice at the art
then I fear those and add [Rungupp] along with it.
</font>
<br>
<font color=#000000>
You say, 'Who is Rungupp?'
</font>
<br>
<font color=#888888>
Marzus Demsion says 'Rungupp is a young shaman troll who often can be found
blocking passage across the bridge to all young erudites.
Rather than exterminate the beast,
we use him as a test for our young necromancers.
We invite all young Heretics to attempt to [defeat Rungupp].
</font>
<br>
<font color=#000000>
You say, 'I will defeat Rungupp.'
</font>
<br>
<font color=#888888>
Marzus Demsion says 'Then go test your strength young necromancer.
Defeat Rungupp, chop off his head and return it to me.
If this is accomplished I shall reward you.
Good luck.

Marzus Demsion says 'So you have defeated the troll called Rungupp.
You have past the test.
We shall resurrect him for another young necromancer.
As for you, take this.
It was once mine and is now yours.
Welcome to the circle of the Heretics.
