<H1 align="center">Guide for DE blacksmither</H1>
<br>
<br>
<p><hr>
<font size="+2">J</font>ust a few word about me, I'm a Shadow Knight dark elfe bringing plague, rage in honour of my dear master Chaka. I started blacksmithing one day when I was too lazy to go smash some lizards in cazic thule :) So this guide is certainly not the most complete you will find around, but i hope it will get you some good tips and tricks for a good beginning =)
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</p>
<P>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Please read all this guide and mail all your comments to  <a href="mailto:thoane@altern.org">thoane@altern.org</a> this will help me get the evil guild up to date ! Especially if you find other ways to skill up, find mistake in the guild, english errors (there must be alot of)  YOU HAVE TO MAIL ME :)</p>

<!-- REAL GUIDE START THERE !! -->

<center><table border="0" width="600">
<tr><td>
<H2>Before starting</h2>
<p>
Here are some things to know before even thinking of starting black smithing:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A good blacksmither is a RICH blacksmither
<li>Try to maximise charisma as it helps buy for cheap and sell back for good price.
<li>Buy the blacksmithing guide from a vendor and put it in one of your slot (not in backpack or a bag). This will raise your luck of success.
<li>Get some money and be sure to have some times.
</ol>
<p>
You need some good knowledge of the neriak city. For the first level of the skill you can do everything in Neriak Common. I advise you to go check the web site <a href="http://www.neriak.com/">http://www.neriak.com/</a> section 'Vendor Catalog' on right  then check on the left frame for 'neriak commons'.</p>
<p>
Now let's head to the bank, take some platines and start raising skill !
</p>
<br>



<h2>Begining <font size="-1">(skill 1-21)</font></h2>
<p>
There is two way to get your first points:<br>
Firstly, you can just spend training points from your guildmaster in order to aachieve level 21 really quickly.
Secondely, stock rusty weapon or buy them from differents vendor in neriakA. Then head to neriakB and go to the tavern 'Fishing bale'. It's an underwater tavern whith two brothers playing darts. The male one, sell sharping stone. Buy 40 of them for 3-4 coppers each (depending on charisma).<br>
Near 'adamant armor' you could find a forge and start raising your skill. Here the simple receipt:</p>
<br>
1 RUSTY WEAPON  +  1 SHARPENING STONE  =  1 TARNISHED WEAPON
<br>
<p>Do that till you are level 21 in black smith.</p>
<br>


<H2>Raising a bit again <font size="-1">(skill 22-51)</font></h2>
<p>
You can continue skilling till level 28 by sharpening 'rusty scimitar' and even to level 31 with 'rusty two hand sword'. Problem is that they are rare, if you have some luck i advise you to skill this way till 31.</p>
<p>
Now we need to preparing the next step by creating metal bits. You have to buy 'small piece of ore' from the tavern (those one are stackable) and 'flask of water'. Buy 80 pieces of ore and 40 flask of water. Got everything ? Head back to the forge and start the 'metal bits' receip:</p>
<br>
1 SMALL PIECE OF ORE  +  1 SMALL PIECE OF ORE  +  ONE FLASK OF WATER  =  1 METAL BIT
<br>
<p>
It's important to have the two pieces of ore NOT STACKED or the combining will not work at all hehe. So keep doing that and get a good amount of 'metal bits'. I think it could also raise your skill till level 28 but that is a thing I'm really not sure lol.</p>
<p>
Now we are going to make toolbox that will bring us to level 51, once again just follow:</p>
<br>
1 METAL BIT  +  1 FLASK OF WATER  =  ONE TOOLBOX
<br>
<p>
I have no clue about the use of those toolbox unless they aren't trivial till level 51. It's possible that toolbox are used for those pale gnomes tinkering skill =) So just sell them and got some money back ! Oh also watch out cause they aren't not stackable and also not putable in a backpack.</p>
<p> The best place for doing that is at the forge near adamant armo. The buyer is close.</p>
<br>




<h2>First useful item <font size="-1">(skill 52-68)</font></h2>
<p>
We will make lantern this time and it's pretty easy thing to do ! For that you need 'a bottle' find in the fish blind tavern at the first floor, also need a metal bits that you are able to do pretty well now, a flask of water for freshing, and of course a MOLD.</p>
<p>The mold are really close from the adamant forge. It is at the first floor of the shop 'Toadstool' and our brother 'Halvn B`Dolph' will be happy to sell you some. You are now able to follow this receipe:</p>
<br>
1 METAL BITS  +  1 LANTERN CASE MOLD  +  1 FLASK OF WATER  +  1 BOTTLE  =  1 LARGE LANTERN
<br>
<p>
If lucky you could sell large lantern for about 3-5 pp just as greater lightstones, as i'm rich i just don't care and sold them back to vendor.</p>



<H2>The difficult way of being evil <font size="-1">(skill 69-115)</font></h2>
<P>
Well here is the big difficulty of being an evil one. All the guides I find around advice a blacksmither to build skewer as they are really cheap. The problem is that the mold for skewer are found only in 'good city' and cabilis (and no it is not found in thugardin the dwarf city of velious).</p>
<p>I am admited in north freeport (well amiably with the cleric guild of freeport being a dark elf shadowknight is really fun). For this you need to kill many orcs in the commonlands and help paladin with their soulfire quest by killing sir lucan (one bash is enough hehe).</p>
<P>You will then need a friend or another account to go in east freeport buy you some molds and grab them back to you. The receipe is as follow:</p>
<br>
1 METAL BITS + 1 SKEWER CASE MOLD + 1 FLASK OF WATER = 1 SKEWER
<br>
<P>
With an INT of 130 i need 2 backpacks of metal bits to go from skill 69 to 112. It cost me 10 platiniums only (i don't take in count the price of metal bits just molds and flask). I used a human enchanter with 115 in charism provided by my brother (thanks you sorwy 8-) ).</p>


<H2>Really easy skilling up<font size="-1">(skill 116-135)</font></h2>
<p>
This part have been the easiest ever seen. I find on a spoiler site that the skewer were the easiest for leveling up, the only problem is again those damn mold which are found in 'good city', one of those is named high pass hold :). I had the luck to hunt there from level 16 to level 23 and got a good faction with the guards there, the faction isn't really protected so you will have little problems to raise it enough. If you are between lvl 15 and 22 just hunt gnolls and orcs there and take care of the guards (sow is great for that). If you are higher level just camp the gnoll which drop the PGT this will provide you faction and a great loot.</p>
<P>
With your good faction you have to go to the inn called serpent sight. The male human sell water while the woman one sell the two molds needed for skilling up. I personally take TWO backpacks of metal bits (20 x 8 x 2 = 320 metal bits) and 50 platiniums, this have been just enough to go from 116 to 135 :)</p>


<H2>Life of a black smither<font size="-1">(skill 136+)</font></h2>
<p>
Well you are now an happy black smither and it costs you around 200 pp and 20 hours of your time. You are able to make most part of banded armor trivialy and will made some cash with them. My advice is to stay in the commonlands and auction for full set of banded armor, a good auction should look as:</p>
<center>Vdiyan *auction*: 'Selling banded armor !  better than leather lighter than bronze ! Only 1pp per AC</center>
<P>
This is THE usefulness of banded armor: it is light, provide good protection and cheap. Each piece can be sold for 5 to 10 pp and you will be loved all other the place :).</p>
