        <h1>Guide to Temple of Veeshan (Hall of Testing)</h1>
        <p class="summary">This guide will help you to find your way to and 
        through ToV Hall of Testing. It covers general things about the HoT and 
        some suggestions on Fighting Strategies and also some useful Links.<br>
        This guide isn't the Testament and it only contain my experience I made 
        and suggestions out of my experience (3 weeks Eastern Faith)/what I read.</p>
        <h2>What you need for the Raid</h2>
        <p>In order to plan a successful raid of Hot (Hall of Testing), one must 
        have a proper force to attack and should have at least 3 hours time to 
        play. <br>
        All players should be of level 54 or higher and have at least 100 MR. and 
        120 FR/CR unbuffed (lower Levels need higher resists as lower Levels). 
        How many groups and what types of classes you have available will decide 
        how many mobs and named mobs you can kill (Repop time in HoT is 1 hour - 
        not sure on named).<br>
        My experience shows that u can do ToV with 2 High Level groups or 4 55+.
        <br>
        To the normal classes you bring to the raid (Tanks, Clerics...) you 
        should bring at least one Bard, Shaman (alternative Magician) and 
        Enchanter with you - epics preferred and as higher as better (Bard need 
        to have the Song Occlusion of Sounds - Level 55 and a Drum).</p>
        <h2>Getting to ToV</h2>
        <p>- Port to Cobalt Scar , ask for levitate and invis<br>
        - walk to Sirens Grotto (invis!!!) - Entrance is located at +1150, 
        +1560<br>
        - evac through SG (need Druid or Wizard  ) and zone to Western Wastes<br>
        - walk to Entrance to the Temple of Veeshann (invis if you are kos to 
        CoV!!!) which is located at +700, +700<br>
        - Casters bind at the two Columns before entering ToV</p>
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>The map below shows the layout of Temple of Veeshan. The orange dots 
        represent mobs that are kos to everyone, the green dots show mobs that 
        only kos if u haven't at least dubious CoV Faction.</p>
        <p>ToV is broken up by three areas. One is HoT for kos people to CoV 
        where the Kael Quest armor drops (West) and the other is the HoT for 
        nonkos (=at least dubious) people where the SS Quest armor drops (East). 
        The third is the &quot;Northern Part of ToV&quot; - home of the Named Dragons 
        (Dragons 70+).</p>
        <p>Once into ToV you can only exit ToV through Gate, Port or the exits 
        in the West - which requires at least dubious to CoV and the exit in the 
        North.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/tov_complete.jpg"> </p>
        <h2>Hall of Testing</h2>
        <p>Arrived in ToV (as far I know drakes along the way to HoT see invis 
        so if you are kos wait for CoH) open the door to the north and follow 
        the hallway to the end. At the end turn right and open the door. Now you 
        are in a big room with 4 doors - (West - Kos CoV Hot, North - North ToV 
        with Named Dragons level 70+, East Non-kos HoT). Move to the middle of 
        the room and head east. DON'T OPEN THE DOOR !!!!! - ask if anyone inside 
        is fighting and if its ok if you open the door.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/halloftest.jpg"></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/hot.jpg"></p>
        <h2>Some Basics on HoT</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li><strong>Never enter or open the Door </strong>(No.1 on the Map)
          <strong>without asking !</strong> - why? Cause the guards form outside 
          HoT will assist the mob you fight atm<br>
          or incase u have CoV kos peoples with you they will jump on you. </li>
          <li>Hunting in HoT wont ruin your Faction to CoV - except Boss of the 
          HoT (Dozekar - Level 70 bad ass!) </li>
          <li>Dragons cant be mezzed - so if you get adds multitank them </li>
          <li>Clerics and Caster stand behind the wall (No. 3 on Map). Cleric 
          all the time as long you can heal your target - caster until you start 
          nuking.<br>
          Why? so you are not hit by the AOE there. (its not an 
          exploit!) </li>
          <li>Fighting the Mob at the pot in the Corner (No.2 on Map) seems to 
          be the best solution. </li>
          <li>On pulls all STAND !!! </li>
          <li>Mobs are Level 60 to 65 - named level 65 to 70. </li>
          <li>Only named dropping quest items </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fighting Strategies</h2>
        <p>As my experience showed M.T.T (Main Tank Tactics) and C.H.R (Complete 
        Heal Rotations) are the best tactics to bring high level encounter down.
        </p>
        <p><strong><u>M.T.T.</u></strong></p>
        <p>The idea of M.T.T is that only one Tank will need to be completely healed.
        <br>
        How you achieve this? Its quite easy the Main Tank (declared by Raid 
        Leader (AC, Weapons, Level)) should taunt as only person and build agro 
        before all other engage the mob. All other Melees attack the mob at the 
        max. attack range. Why? Cause as far you away from the mob less agro 
        you produce.</p>
        <p>This idea I got of a melee board. They suggested to make a hot button 
        like this one:</p>
        <p>hotkey name( up to you any you like ) <br>
        Line 1: /discipline defensive <br>
        Line 2: /pause 600* <br>
        Line 3: /pause 520* <br>
        Line 4: /tell xxxxxx (Main Tank 2) my def gone in 5 sec,move up taunt 
        and open defensive plz!! <br>
        Line 5: /gu my def gone ,change your target to xxxxxx (Main Tank 2) for 
        CH plz!! </p>
        <p>*10 = 1 sec</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/mtt_bsptov.jpg"></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/mtt1.jpg"></p>
        <p><strong><u>C.H.R.</u></strong></p>
        <p>The idea of C.H.R is to force the healing on one target cause for one 
        Cleric it is almost impossible to keep the main Tank alive (on High Level 
        encounters) and she/he will produce agro and be summoned and 
        killed. So you try to split the heals among the clerics.<br>
        How does it work? All clerics should make a hot button like this one:</p>
        <p>Line 1: /cast (ch spell slot number - if u have the spell in first 
        slot /cast 1 in second slot /cast 2 and so on.....) <br>
        Line 2: /shout Casting CH on %t xxxxxx be ready!<br>
        Line 3: /pause 30 <br>
        Line 4: /tell xxxxxx your next on list to CH !</p>
        <p>(Now your asking, what does this macro do ? Well, it heals your 
        target, and includes a pause on 3 seconds where you after automatically 
        let the next person who are up for CH know, that it is his/hers turn. )</p>
        <p>I see this working best when all clerics in one group (communication, 
        loose of information) and if possible with a Bard 55+ for mana song.<br>
        This wont work the first time you try (getting message to heal to late 
        cause of battle spam) and the timing must be finded out, but as soon 
        this problems solved and you trained it its quite easy.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Suggestions on Groups/Buffing</u></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>One Enchanter or Shaman should be in each tank Group for haste and 
          one Enchanter in each Caster group for C2. This will reduce the 
          downtime for buffing and the spam in tells/ooc/guild chat asking for 
          buff xy. </li>
          <li>One Druid and/or Shaman should be enough to heal the members of 
          the group - cause if the M.T.Ts. are followed you only will be hitted 
          by the AOE Spell (full dmg aprox 600 HP). </li>
          <li>Clerics should group together cause of better communication and 
          concentrate on healing the Main Tank(s). </li>
          <li>Bard is adding 160 MR 80FR/CR/DR/PR with his songs (Elemental 
          Rhythms and Guardian Rhythms) using a Selos Drum of the March - what 
          means using his drums he wont melee. Best use of her/him is with 
          peoples who laggin on resists or in AOE Range (Resists are at 255 
          maxed) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We all know form our Naggy / Vox raid buffing/froming Groups is the 
        most consuming and boring point of a raid and is causing most downtime.</p>
        <p>There are two ways to do the buffing. First way, and I prefer this 
        one, is build the group as supposed except one and invite the person 
        (Cleric, Enchanter, Druid, Shaman) to your group. At end all none buffed 
        persons group and getting buffed.<br>
        Other way is people try to get their buffs themselves by telling the 
        person for buffs - what is a pain for the person cause she/he gets into 
        tell hell so be patient u will get your buff. If not retell after some 
        min.</p>
        <p>All in all you can help making this faster if you be patient listen 
        to the Raid leader, do /LFG ON at start of the raid and don't go AFK or do 
        other things.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Fighting Procedure</u></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>After all preparations are done (making Groups, Buffing, 
          Hot buttons (all should have an assist button)) Monk starts pulling 
          (first u have to kill the 2 Wurms down the stairs - level 60ties if I 
          remind right). They are hard to split cause of the room the Monk has 
          so please all stand back and wait till main tank shout to attack) -
          <strong>on pulls all stand please!!!</strong> </li>
          <li>Main tank engage the mob and tank/taunt him for 10 seconds using 
          defensive disciplines. </li>
          <li>While main tank building agro Bard should debuff the mob using 
          Occlusion of Sounds (30 resistance debuff unresistable) - as soon done 
          msg %T is debuffed so enchanter/magician/shaman know they can start 
          debuffing now (Shaman/Magician with Malosi Serie and Enchanter with 
          Tashani Serie). </li>
          <li>As soon the mob is dispelled enchanter or shaman try to slow the 
          mob. </li>
          <li>After main tank built agro he shout Engage %T and this is the sign 
          for all tanks to attack - plz try to attack from the max. Melee range.
          </li>
          <li>If disc fades or Main Tank down Main Tank 2 move forward and build 
          agro (see M.T.T) </li>
          <li>Only Main tank use TAUNT !!!! </li>
          <li>at 50% Casters nuke the bad mofo to death :-) </li>
          <li>If you get agro DON'T RUN!!! STAND AND HOPE MAIN TANK GET THE MOB 
          OF YOU - if not wait for the rez window. Ping Pong will only get 
          others killed!!! </li>
          <li>If you die consent all clerics with rezsticks. </li>
          <li>Loot and hope it has an armor piece </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Which channel should I use for my debuff/snare/heal.... messages?<br>
        Hmmm that's very hard to say best try it out - but its a very important 
        thing as important information can be lost. <br>
        One solution is maybe Group all clerics and Debuffer in one group each 
        so they see all in group chat.. </p>
        <p>One last point - please keep the spam (unneeded messages) to the 
        minimum and don't argue about something in open channels - do it in 
        tells.<br>
        I hope this Guide will help you a bit have fun in ToV-HoT and luck on 
        drops :-)</p>
