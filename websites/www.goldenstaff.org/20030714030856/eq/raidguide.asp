        <span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Raid Guide</span></b></p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p class="MsoNormal">So you want to go on a raid? Well before you do 
        there are a few things you need to know before you dive in.&nbsp; Large-scale 
        raids operate a little differently than the groups most of you are 
        familiar with. Now you may have been on raids before and think you got 
        it down but read thru anyway you might learn a thing or two. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Why do we have raids?&nbsp; Well the basic reason is 
        that the mobs that drop the uber items ya’ll been drooling over are too 
        badass for a single group to kill. So you round up 12 to 50 (or more) of 
        your closest buddies and go whack him, simple right?&nbsp; Not quite. When 
        you get that many folks in one-place things can get a might chaotic 
        unless ya’ll get organized. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Now you’ve all been in good groups and you’ve all 
        been in bad groups. If you think back about what the difference was I’ll 
        think you find it was mainly organization. In a good group, the group 
        members all had defined tasks, they knew what to do, and when to do it 
        and ya’ll worked together in harmony. Now what achieved this harmony?&nbsp; 
        Organization, that’s what did it. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Groups can get organized different ways.&nbsp; One way 
        it can happen is you’ve been playing together for a long time and it 
        just happened as you went along.&nbsp; Another way is you had a group leader 
        that told you what he wanted you to do, and when he wanted you to do it. 
        Now both ways work just fine, and both can have problems to. The first 
        way takes time and the more folks you got the longer it takes and it can 
        be hard when you get new folks. The second way can get you organized a 
        lot quicker but the group lead has to have a good idea what each group 
        member can do. If he gives you bad assignments, isn’t clear or tries to 
        micromanage the groups it doesn’t work to well.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">For large-scale raids all these problems get a lot 
        bigger. This guideline will help bring you up to speed on how we do 
        things at OGS. </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
        <h1>Raiding with OGS</h1>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Who gets to raid with OGS?&nbsp; Just about anybody that 
        meets the requirements.&nbsp; We’re a friendly bunch of folks who enjoy 
        playing the game and being with other folks.&nbsp; Attendance at raids is not 
        mandatory.</p>
        <h2>Full members</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Any full member that meets the 
        requirements for the raid may attend. Full members are the only ones 
        that can request raids, be they for an item or a quest. Requesting a 
        raid doesn’t mean we’re going to do it right away but if it is within 
        our capability we will get to it.&nbsp; Full members are eligible for all 
        tradable and no-drop loot that is not pre-assigned (loot table or quest 
        item). Full members can be pre-assigned loot items.&nbsp; </p>
        <h2>Pledges</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Any pledge that meets the requirements for 
        the raid may attend. Pledges are eligible for all tradable and no-drop 
        loot that is not pre-assigned (loot table or quest item). Pledges may be 
        pre-assigned loot items in certain cases.</p>
        <h2>Applicants &amp; Guests</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Applicants and guests that meet the 
        requirements for the raid may attend with the permission of the raid 
        leader or guild officers. Applicants and guests are eligible for all 
        tradable loot and any no-drop loot that is not pre-assigned.</p>
        <h1>Raid Goals</h1>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Raids are organized with particular goals in mind. 
        A raid can have more than one goal.</p>
        <h2>Item Raids</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Item raids are intended to get armor, 
        weapons, equipment or other items for the raid attendees or the guild.&nbsp; 
        Item raids are usually not intended to be experience raids, so don’t be 
        surprised if your group does not get experience.&nbsp; In fact you can pretty 
        much count on losing experience during the raid, so don’t be surprised 
        or upset when this happens.&nbsp; The raid leader usually tries to configure 
        the groups to best use the people he has to accomplish the goal of 
        getting items.&nbsp; </p>
        <h2>Quest Raids</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Quest raids are usually organized to kill 
        some big ugly monster as part of a quest.&nbsp; On most quest raids only one 
        person on the raid is going to get anything and most of the time it 
        isn’t going to be you. </p>
        <h2>Experience Raids</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">On experience raids, the raid leader tries 
        to configure the groups to spread the experience among all the 
        attendees.&nbsp; This is often accomplished by having each group kill their 
        own mobs or by alternating which group gets the experience. The 
        different groups cooperate in the pulling and work together on the 
        bigger mobs or if one group gets in trouble. Experience raids are like 
        experience groups just bigger.&nbsp; If you are on an experience raid and 
        your group is getting most of the kills, back off a bit and let the 
        other groups get a few.</p>
        <h1>Raid Organization</h1>
        <p class="MsoNormal">At OGS he have a certain raid organization that we 
        use on most raids.</p>
        <h2>Raid Leadership</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">The raid leadership is the final authority 
        on how the raid is run and often consists of three leaders with 
        different areas of responsibility. The group leaders also have some 
        responsibilities during raids.</p>
        <h3>Raid Master</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">The raid master or raid lead is person 
        responsible for conducting the raid.&nbsp; All aspects of the raid (raid 
        goal, start time, group make up, raid route, loot distribution etc.) are 
        his responsibility. On a large raid the raid master can be very busy so 
        he may delegate some aspects of the raid to other players. At OGS we 
        usually use two assistant raid leaders, the loot master and the group 
        master, to help reduce the workload on the raid master. </p>
        <h3>Loot Master</h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">The raid loot master is 
        responsible for the distribution of the loot acquired during the raid. 
        He determines who gets the loot, either by random roll, loot table or 
        pre-assignment.</p>
        <h3>Group Master</h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">The raid group master is 
        responsible for the make up of the groups during the raid. The group 
        master will assign group leads and members.</p>
        <h3>Group Leaders</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">The group leaders are responsible for 
        making sure that all their group members are, present, buffed and good 
        to go.&nbsp; If you need to go away from keyboard or need a group buff, 
        inform your group lead.&nbsp; The group lead is responsible for informing the 
        raid master if any one in their group goes link dead. The group leads 
        are expected to speak up if anyone in their group is lost, dead, AFK, LD 
        etc. when necessary.</p>
        <p><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
        <br clear="all" style="page-break-before:always">
&nbsp;</span></b></p>
        <h1>General Raid Rules</h1>
        <p class="MsoNormal">While you’re on a raid there are some rules you got 
        to follow.</p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">If you want to go on a raid you have to 
        meet certain requirements. </p>
        <h3>Level</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">All raids have a minimum level 
        requirement.&nbsp; This level requirement is usually set based on the level 
        of the mobs in the zone we are raiding. The amount of people on a raid 
        can have some influence on the minimum level, if there are a lot of 
        people on the raid then sometimes the level requirement can be relaxed a 
        bit. Player class also can be taken into account, support classes 
        (clerics, druids, shamans, enchanters) often can be slightly below the 
        minimum level and still be effective on the raid.&nbsp; If the raid is short 
        of players of a particular class the raid leader my elect to relax the 
        minimum level requirement for that class only.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">Level is limited for two 
        main reasons.&nbsp; The first is mob agro.&nbsp; Lower level players agro mobs 
        more and from further away, there is a significant reduction in mob agro 
        at levels 55 and 60. A lower level player on a raid can cause mobs to 
        join the fight that normally wouldn’t, which can overwhelm the raid and 
        cause a wipeout. Also some mobs will agro more on lower level players 
        and make it hard for the main assist to keep the mobs attention. As a 
        lower level player, your hit points and armor class are most likely 
        quite a bit less than the main assists, this means you take more damage 
        and the clerics have to spend more mana keeping your butt alive. If your 
        level is significantly lower than other folks on the raid, don’t be 
        surprised if you spend a lot of time dead. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">The second reason to limit 
        level is damage.&nbsp; A lower level player has lower skill levels, and less 
        effective spells. This means they don’t do as much damage to the mob, in 
        fact if there is a large difference between mob level and player level, 
        they may not be able to do any significant damage at all.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">The combination of these 
        two reasons represents a penalty to the raid. With a smaller raid, the 
        raid lead may decide that the penalty is too great and decide not to 
        accept anyone below the level limit.&nbsp; On larger raids, the raid lead may 
        decide that there is enough extra capability to deal with the penalty 
        and let you come, but it is entirely up to the raid lead.&nbsp; If you ask to 
        come and the raid lead turns you down based on level, don’t take it 
        personal or beg to come anyway.&nbsp; Go find yourself a nice experience 
        group, fix the level problem and come next time.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">Some raids may have an 
        upper level limit.&nbsp; This is usually because of game mechanics, for 
        example Naggy and Vox raids have an upper limit of 52 because the game 
        won’t let anyone with a higher level in the area with the mob.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Gate Potions</h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">If you can’t gate 
        yourself, you are expected to have a gate potion on your person.&nbsp; Many 
        raids end at the bottom of some really nasty dungeons that we just spent 
        the better part of the night getting to. We often don’t have the time or 
        desire to fight back out, in fact on a planes raid that often isn’t an 
        option.&nbsp; Don’t count on transport out with a druid or a wizard being 
        available, have your own way out.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">You can make your own gate 
        potion, buy one from a vendor or buy one from a shaman.&nbsp; All of them 
        work fine, just have it on you before the raid starts.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Punctuality</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">It’s important for you to be at the raid 
        staging area on time. It’s certainly not fair to the rest of the folks 
        on the raid to be waiting on your butt while you kill that last mob in 
        Velks or Seb. If you can’t be on early enough to get to the staging area 
        before the time the raid is scheduled to start, get to the raid staging 
        area the night before the raid. If you know your going to be late, let 
        the raid lead know ahead of time. </p>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">A raid will be canceled if it can not 
        start because of lack of numbers or critical classes 30 min past the 
        official start time.&nbsp; The only exception is if the Members present want 
        to extend the time. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.3in">On many raids once we 
        start in it is very difficult to get you to where the raid force is. If 
        you want to join a raid that is in progress ask the raid lead if you can 
        join. If he turns you down, accept it, don’t bug him, he’s usually 
        pretty busy. If he decides to let you join, get to the raid zone on your 
        own, buy a port, run, do whatever it takes to get there, just don’t be 
        asking folks on the raid to come get you. Once you get to the raid zone, 
        let the raid lead know, then wait.&nbsp; It may be a while before the raid 
        lead can send someone to come get you.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Raid Communication</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Communication during a raid will be on the 
        raid channel.&nbsp; The raid master will announce the raid channel and all, 
        directions, incoming calls, attack calls will be in the raid channel.&nbsp; 
        It is requested that you keep chatter to a minimum in the raid channel.&nbsp; 
        It is important that you join the raid channel since all instructions 
        will be given there.&nbsp; The raid channel lists is also used by the group 
        master to determine who is on the raid and assign them to groups.</p>
        <h2>Loot</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">All loot distribution will be made either 
        by the Raid Master or the Loot Master.</p>
        <h3>No Drop Items</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">All raid attendee’s are eligible for any 
        no-drop loot with the exception of pre-assigned or quest items.&nbsp; The 
        loot master will announce the item and stats as required.&nbsp; All 
        interested parties will send the loot master a tell to indicate that 
        they would like a chance at the item.&nbsp; The loot master will then 
        announce the interested parties names and assign each a number.&nbsp; (i.e.&nbsp; 
        Fred 1, Bob 2, Carol 3).&nbsp; If you don’t see your name on the list, tell 
        the loot master you want in.&nbsp; When all interested parties have been 
        assigned a number the loot master will random from 1 to the highest 
        number (for the above example /random 1 3). Based on this roll the loot 
        master will announce the winner. Once you have been awarded an item you 
        are usually out for any other rolls unless no one else wants the item or 
        everyone has gotten an item.</p>
        <h3>Tradable Items</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">All raid attendees are eligible for any 
        tradable items that are acquired during the raid with the exception of 
        pre-assigned or quest items.&nbsp; Unless otherwise announced, tradable items 
        are intended for the use of the player character on the raid not for 
        alternate characters. Upon looting a tradable item you are to pass it to 
        the loot master unless he requests that you hold it for him.&nbsp; Tradable 
        loot will be randomed either as it drops or at the end of the raid at 
        the loot master’s discretion. The random method used is the same as 
        described for no-drop items.&nbsp; Again once you win an item you will be out 
        for further items. </p>
        <h3>Quest Gems</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">Quest gems are the property of the guild.</p>
        <h3>Non-quest Gems</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">Non-quest gems are the property of the 
        guild and will be used either to make resistance items or sold to offset 
        raid expenses.</p>
        <h3>Spells</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">Spells will be awarded to using classes on 
        the raid; if more than one person requires the spell they will be 
        randomed as above. Spells will only be awarded to player characters that 
        have a high enough level to use them. Non-awarded spells are the 
        property of the guild.</p>
        <h3>Trinkets</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">Trinkets are the property of the guild and 
        will be sold to offset raid expenses.</p>
        <h3>Junk</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">Junk items (Fine Steel, etc) will 
        generally be destroyed; if you want any particular items you are welcome 
        to them as long as you carry them.</p>
        <h3>Cash</h3>

        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">Movement of the raid party 
        will be as directed by the raid master.&nbsp; No one else should be calling 
        moves and you should not move from the current raid location unless 
        directed to do so by the raid master. It is also important that you do 
        not wander around or move ahead of the raid party.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">The raid master will 
        announce when a move is eminent and you are expected to be ready to move 
        when told to.&nbsp; If you or your group are not ready to move be sure tell 
        your group lead or the raid master.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Should you be attacked during a move, keep 
        coming or die in place, don’t stop to fight the mob.&nbsp; Having the raid 
        party spread out and fighting in different spots during a move is a 
        leading cause of raid wipeouts.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">If you become lost during 
        a move, announce that you are lost and freeze where you are.&nbsp; Don’t 
        wander around trying to find the raid party.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">If you come back from an 
        AFK or LD and find you are alone, announce that you are back and stay 
        where you are.&nbsp; The raid master will assign someone to get you, or tell 
        you what to do.</p>
        <h2>Combat</h2>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in">Combat is what makes or 
        breaks a raid. Therefore it is very important that you follow the combat 
        rules.</p>
        <h3>Puller</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">The raid master will designate a puller or 
        a pull team.&nbsp; The puller is the only person that should be attacking 
        mobs to bring them to camp.&nbsp; If you have not been designated as the 
        puller, do not pull mobs to camp.</p>
        <h3>Main Assist</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">The raid master will designate the main 
        assist.&nbsp; The main assist is the only one that initiates an attack on a 
        mob. In order to allow the mob to be positioned, other melee players are 
        to remain well clear of the main assist and the mob until the main 
        assist calls for attack in the raid channel. Once attack is called be 
        sure to use the assist command to verify that you are on the correct mob 
        before attacking. </p>
        <h3>Second Assist</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">The second assist will take over as main 
        assist if the main assist is killed or disabled.&nbsp; The second assist is 
        also responsible for tanking any adds which cannot be mezzed.&nbsp; One or 
        more groups may be assigned to assist the second assist.&nbsp; In that case 
        the second assist functions as the main assist for those groups and the 
        same wait for the attack call rule applies to the second assists groups. 
        The second assist (and the groups assigned to the second assist) is the 
        only player that should be fighting a mob different than what the main 
        assist is on.</p>
        <h3>Adds</h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">If you see another mob approaching the 
        camp while a fight is in progress you are expected to call “ADD” in the 
        raid channel.&nbsp; Do not attack the add mob.&nbsp; If you are getting beat up by 
        an add mob, yell and scream, do not attack the mob and do not run. </p>
