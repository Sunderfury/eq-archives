             <b>
             <a name="Gen1">How</a> old is the Order of the Goldenstaff?</b><br>
        The Order of the Goldenstaff was formed in 1992.&nbsp; The Guild began 
        in the game NeverWinterNights played on AOL.<p>
        <b>
        <a name="Gen2">How</a> many members does OGS have?</b><br>
        We have approximately 50 to 60 members with over 150 Alts in EQ.</p>
        <p><b><a name="Gen3">What</a> are the Guild 
             Values?</b><br>
        OGS is all about Family and treating each other with respect.&nbsp; We 
        pride our selves with being fair and when we make a mistake we attempt 
        to correct it immediately. </p>
        <p><b><a name="Gen4">Does</a> OGS power level its members?</b><br>
        OGS does not power level its members we prefer to group and build the 
        toons as complete characters.</p>
        <p><b><a name="Gen5">Does</a> OGS have a 
             raid schedule?</b><br>
        Yes, and it can be found <a href="schedule/schedule.htm">Here</a>.</p>
        <p><b><a name="Gen6">Do </a>Classes that have component costs for Spells 
             get reimbursed? </b> <br>
        We try to compensate the classes with loot.&nbsp; We 
        plan on providing all classes with a component based spell the component 
        in advance of the raid in the future.</p>
          <p><font class="nav">Membership</font></p>
          <p><b>
          <a name="Mem1">What</a> are the Level requirements for OGS?</b><br>
          There are no level requirements necessary for membership.&nbsp; We do 
          have an active base of 40 plus in game and we are building a program 
          to ensure those below 40 are not left behind. </p>
          <p><b><a name="Mem2">Do</a> I need recommendations to join the guild?</b><br>
          No, you do not need recommendations/sponsors. However it is required 
          of you to join OGS on as many raids/events/groups as possible in order 
          to be considered by the committee.&nbsp; </p>
          <p><b><a name="Mem3">What</a> is the Admissions Committee?</b><br>
          The admissions committee consists of 6 members.  Lilyy, Taladan, Brendil, Rastrel, Keyline, and Ogskosh.  The Admissions Committee votes in about 5 applicants each month to join the guild as pledges. </p>
          <p><b><a name="Mem4">Where</a> do I apply and what happens after I apply?</b><br>
          After reading our <a href="recruitment.asp">Admissions Policy</a> and 
          clicking on the “I agree” button at the bottom you will be sent to our 
          application. Applying does not mean you are automatically in the 
          guild. OGS is an invite only guild and you must be voted on by our 
          committee to join. It is your responsibility to come to as many 
          raids/events/groups as possible to get to know the guild.</p>
          <p><b><a name="Mem5">When</a> will I get a Mentor?</b><br>
          Once you are invited in by the admissions committee you will receive a 
          mentor shortly after.</p>
          <p><b><a name="Mem6">How</a> long is the Pledge process?</b><br>
          The time it takes to complete the pledge process is up to the Pledge 
          and the Mentor.&nbsp; A pledge quest will be assigned and the mentor 
          will monitor the progress&nbsp; and notify the Head of Admissions 
          when the pledge is ready for induction.</p>
          <p><b><a name="Mem7">What</a> happens if I Detag?<br>
          </b>We take membership in OGS seriously.&nbsp; Once tagged OGS if you 
          remove your tag for any reason not approved by the GM in advance, you 
          will not be allowed to be retagged for 90 days.&nbsp; </p>
          <p><font class="nav">Epics</font></p>
          <p><b>
       	<a name="Epic1">Who</a> gets epic drops?</b><br>
        Epic drops will be looted according the epic loot chart.&nbsp; The basis 
        of that system is under review.</p>
       	<p><b><a name="Epic2">What</a> happens if two members are at the same point?</b><br>
          Epic drops will be looted according the epic loot chart.&nbsp; The 
        basis of that system is under review.</p>
        <p><b><a name="Epic3">Are</a> there requirements for guild Help on Epics?</b><br>
        Yes, you must have been tagged as OGS for at least four months and be a 
        full member for at least 2 months. </p>
        <p><b><a name="Epic4">What if I want to get an epic for an alt of mine?</a></b><br>
        Main characters are currently the only one's that will be considered for
        help with on epics.&nbsp; However, this is under review, and may require
        a minimum level for an alt to be considered on the epic list. </p>
          <p><font class="nav">Loot Rules</font></p>
        <b>
        <a name="Loot1">What</a> is the OGS loot System?</b><br>
        The OGS Loot system is based on &quot;Need before Greed&quot;&nbsp; Most Items will 
        be up for general Random looting.&nbsp; If during a Raid an Item is 
        dropped that in the right hands will significantly help the guild the 
        item may be awarded without a roll.&nbsp; This will be determined by the 
        raid loot master. (An example would be Willsapper)<br>
&nbsp;<p>Willsapper <br>
        LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP <br>
        Damage: 13<br>
        Delay: 20 <br>
        Ratio: 1.538 Amazing <br>
        AC: +9 HP: +35 <br>

        Shadowknight Bard Rogue Warrior <br>
        Races: All Races <br>

        <p>Even though many classes can use this weapon it would be awarded to 
        one of the OGS Warriors based on their guild participation.</p>
          
        <p><b><a name="Loot2">Do</a> you have special Loot Rules for ToV </b> <br>
        Yes, and they can be found <a href="tov/lootrules.asp">here</a><p><b>
        Raids</b></p>
        <p><b><a name="Raid1">Does</a> OGS raid often?<br>
        </b>OGS Raids about three nights a week.&nbsp; We have raids in all the 
        expansions.&nbsp; Check out our <a href="schedule/schedule.htm">Schedule</a>
