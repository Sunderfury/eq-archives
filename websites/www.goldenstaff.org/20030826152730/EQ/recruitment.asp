        Applying to Order of the Golden Staff
        <p><i> After you have read this admissions policy you can fill out our 
        application by clicking the “I agree” button at the bottom of this page.
        </i></p>
        <p>OGS does not judge a person on race, level or class therefore all 
        levels, races, and classes are welcome to apply. However OGS does not 
        take in just anybody. We are looking for fun, knowledgeable, loyal, 
        honest, and active adventurers who seek a family. </p>
        <p>Before even thinking about joining OGS you first need know what we 
        are about. If you are looking to join OGS as a stepping-stone into 
        another guild, you are in the wrong place. If you are looking to join 
        OGS as means to get yourself uber loot, you are in the wrong place. If 
        you are looking to join OGS to help you on your epic right away you are 
        in the wrong place. OGS is a family that supports each other in the long 
        haul and has fun in the process. Yes, we do work on epics and loot but 
        that is not the main goal for us and never will be. </p>
        <p>OGS is an invite only guild. We allow others to tag along on our 
        raids and groups so that we may get to know you. The more events that 
        you join us on, the more it will help you. You can always find us by 
        joining the ogsraid chat channel to find out what the guild is up to 
        that day. You need to check out the <a href="../oath.asp">OGS Oath</a>,
        <a href="../charter.asp">Charter</a>, and <a href="raidguide.asp">Raid 
        Rules</a> if you are thinking about joining us. </p>
        <p>Once a month up to 5 people (this number can change based on what the 
        guild can handle at that time) will be selected by our Committee to 
        become pledges in the guild. The committee needs to get to know you as 
        best they can to make a good decision, so as stated before you need to 
        raid and group with OGS members as often as possible. The Committee will 
        be voting based on personality, activeness, skill, how valuable your 
        class is to OGS, and how you will fit in with this wonderful family. </p>
        <p>If the committee finds you worthy of joining OGS you will be sent an 
        email from the Head of Admissions (Lilyy) stating what happens next, and 
        you will be tagged as a pledge. This is an extended evaluation period. 
        As a pledge you do not receive all the privileges of a full member. 
        Raids will not be conducted specifically for you, we will not work on 
        your epic (if needed) until 4 months after tag date; 2 of those months 
        must be as a full member, you cannot access the member only boards, and 
        you will not be on the guild email list. </p>
        <p>As a pledge you will be given a mentor. The main purpose of a mentor 
        is to expand a pledges circle of contacts/friends within the guild; and 
        to assign specific tasks with fun and flexibility in mind, that will 
        expand the pledges knowledge/experience. Your mentor is your guide. Your 
        mentor will teach you about the OGS mentality and our family. The 
        process can take from two weeks to two months depending on your game 
        time, familiarity of guild members, game knowledge, and your mentor’s 
        schedule as well. If any problems arise while you are a pledge, it will 
        be discussed within the council and with your mentor to hopefully get 
        the problem resolved. </p>
        <p>Once your mentor deems you ready, you will become a full member of 
        the Order of the Golden Staff. A ceremony will be conducted for you and 
        you will have all the privileges of a full member.</p>
