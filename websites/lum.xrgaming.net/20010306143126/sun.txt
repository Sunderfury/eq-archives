<Epin> what do u wana haer?
<Trav[BAAANNNNNNNEEEEDDDDDDDD]> Ohh  well I have OSI calling me on the phone
<Sinatra[banned]> we have nothing to say except you need to stop posting posts from non sun members and saying its a sun who made it
<Dystic[StillPimp]> Prolly something webworthy.. heh
<Mierin[Blocked]> epin u banned?
<Dystic[StillPimp]> Ya, Sin.
<Lum> Well, you might want to go on CoB and tell them that
<CraizUO> hehe
<Lum> He sure sounded like one of you guys
<CraizUO> SUN got banned
<CraizUO> for using dupe bugs?
<TommyBOY> nope, drugs
<hal-afk> Trav?
<Dystic[StillPimp]> CoB board is not my type of crowd.. why post there.
<CraizUO> and now they dont want anyone to know so that they have better chances of getting unbanned
<CraizUO> right?
<CraizUO> yeh it was one of u guys right Sinatra
<hal-afk> hehe craiz
<CraizUO> thats when u said in here right after not to post anymore
<Trav[BAAANNNNNNNEEEEDDDDDDDD]> <hal-afk> Trav? ?
<CraizUO> hehe
<hal-afk> what osi say?
*** SixSixSix has left #sun
<Sinatra[banned]> lum, they were made in clouds name - and he cant make a post like that without a lot of spelling errors :)
<RAK|KoC> Well Lum obviously OSI hasnt got a clue of what they are doing, they banned a lot of non SUN members that dont even play on sp
<Trav[BAAANNNNNNNEEEEDDDDDDDD]> they didt call yet
<Trav[BAAANNNNNNNEEEEDDDDDDDD]> will in a few ins
<Trav[BAAANNNNNNNEEEEDDDDDDDD]> mins
<hal-afk> o
*** Trav[BAAANNNNNNNEEEEDDDDDDDD] is now known as Trav[Stillbanned]
<TommyBOY> I hate burbing
<CraizUO> OSI said that if SUN told them the bug that they would be unbanned all of them
<Lum> Who at OSI said that?
<Famine[SoV]> sun better get a contract
<Dystic[StillPimp]> Just sit back, watch OSI work their magic... its quite humerous :)
<Famine[SoV]> osi will just fuck them over
<RAK|KoC> they called the net cafe
<hal-afk> lol
<TommyBOY> hey thats cool
*** Dystic[StillPimp] is now known as Dystic[NOT
<CraizUO> i duno who at OSI
<CraizUO> btw Lum , love your site
*** Dystic[NOT is now known as DysBugsBeBad
<hal-afk> whats your sites url lum?
<Famine[SoV]> lum.xgaming.net
<Famine[SoV]> i think
<Lum> http://lum.xrgaming.net/
<Lum> Has a lot of SUN related stuff on it at the moment
<Lum> Imagine that.
<hal-afk> hehe
<Mierin[Blocked]> ya no kidding every board does
<Arch[Banned]> hehe
*** Dystic[SUN] has joined #SUN
<hal-afk> im KoC im just here cause i know alot that were banned :/
<RAK|KoC> Well Lum, the thing is there were actually 2 placed castles on sp but there are no proofs they were owned by sun
<Lum> Well, OSI keeps a log of who places what
<Mierin[Blocked]> um whos the second dystic?
<Lum> So that would be fairly easy to prove
<Dystic[SUN]> Hehe, got booted, gotta wait for my other one to time out ;P
<RAK|KoC> well since the castles got redeeded
*** Monolo has joined #sun
<Dystic[SUN]> If it were so easy, then half of denmark wouldn't be banned ;)
<Mierin[Blocked]> ehehe
<RAK|KoC> i doubt they got serious infos
<Monolo> Did sun realy get baned?
<CraizUO> hehe
<Mierin[Blocked]> yup to a man
<Mierin[Blocked]> or woman
<CraizUO> well considering DrFeelGood's Tower in Chesapeake had over
<CraizUO> 400k each reag
<CraizUO> either he did major reag shopinh
<RAK|KoC> exactly, apparently OSI is playing with those players nerves
<CraizUO> hehe
<CraizUO> or something
<Monolo> Why would you guys exploite bugs?
<Sinatra[banned]> because they are there
<Famine[SoV]> hola
<Gekko[Banned]> craizUO......how would u know
<Famine[SoV]> 400k of each reg
<CraizUO> Because
<Dystic[SUN]> 400k of each reg? Nice.
<CraizUO> I lived next door to him
<Dystic[SUN]> brb
<CraizUO> i stepd on his steps
<Trav[Stillbanned]> There is max 50k ech reg in that tower!
*** Dystic[SUN] has left #SUN
<CraizUO> it was on teh 3rd floor
*** Dystic[SUN] has joined #SUN
<Lum> So Cloud[SUN] didn't post those messages on CoB?
*** DysBugsBeBad has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Sinatra[banned]> no
<Lum> I'll stick a note up to that effect
<Sinatra[banned]> thx
<hal-afk> what tower?
<Dystic[SUN]> Ask the real cloud, he's right there.
<CraizUO> Tower in Chesa
<Kruse> To all...apparently a lot of other non SUN danish people have been banned, then again you might know this, i'm behind :P
<Lum> That's what I was asking
<Dystic[SUN]> Yup Kruse, whole cafes have been banned :)
<Kruse> Real cloud did post on cob
<Kruse> ask him...
<Sinatra[banned]> lol
<Dday> Most of those whiners would have exploited the bug themselves if they had known how it worked rofl
<Cloud[SUN]> yeah
<Cloud[SUN]> it's true
<Gekko[Banned]> Kruse..mekka (sun) and Ballerup (BT) is banned
<Trav[Stillbanned]> Craiz I lived in Fgs tower
<Cloud[SUN]> Kruse is from the UK
<CraizUO> Ahh
<Cloud[SUN]> ad he got banned
<CraizUO> i know
<Kruse> Beat him with the shitty stick!
<Cloud[SUN]> he hasnt duped
<CraizUO> like 8peeps did
<CraizUO> right?
*** Monolo has left #sun
<Kruse> Ouch :(
<Cloud[SUN]> he's on my SUN guildstone
*** Ein[blocked] has joined #sun
<Cloud[SUN]> on drachenfels
*** Ein[blocked] has left #sun
<Cloud[SUN]> that he got banned for
<Famine[SoV]> Dday: of course, i knowid exploit it if i knew...
<Kruse> ya i got it in the neck on my 2nd account
<Kruse> blaocked becuase in clouds's DF SUN guild...
<Kruse> sucks
<Lum> From what I gathered, they banned everyone with duped items and suspended everyone else connected with SUN until they could get the story straight
*** Monolo has joined #sun
<Lum> That's what they are saying anyway
<CassandraSUN[banned]> No Lum
<Dystic[SUN]> Actually. no.
<CassandraSUN[banned]> its way past that point
<Monolo> who all got banned?
<Monolo> say I
<Dystic[SUN]> I'm not banned, and I am SUN. 
*** Rubmywonka sets mode: +o Dystic[SUN]
<Dystic[SUN]> Nearly all US SUNs are not banned.
<Lum> There's a difference between banned and suspended... if you are banned you got an email saying your account is gone
<Trav[Stillbanned]> Might the pll with banned in there name be banned you dickP
<Rubmywonka> Just wondering why you care so much?
<Monolo> Trav
<Kruse> he wants a story :)
<RAK|KoC> Some guys got banned even though they arent SUN
*** Sinatra[banned] is now known as Sinatra[blocked]
<Rubmywonka> and you think you know so much about osi policies and the way the game works
<Kiri-Jolith> Lum OSI can "Suspend" an account for as long as they want
<Monolo> I wasnt the stupid one duping think
<Sinatra[blocked]> correction :)
<RAK|KoC> nor play on SP
<Rubmywonka> how do you know it records who placed houses and such?
<Rubmywonka> what a joke... Lum is DUM
*** Trav[Stillbanned] sets mode: +o Gekko[Banned]
<Lum> OSI can ban whomever they choose for whatever reason
<Dystic[SUN]> Omg, rofl.
<Lum> it's in the TOS
<Rubmywonka> whatever stupid
<RAK|KoC> no they cant
<Monolo> Yes
<RAK|KoC> we are europeans
<Lum> and the developers say they log that stuff
* Lum shrugs
<RAK|KoC> we have rights
<Monolo> Mady if you would read the TOS
<Kruse> They can ban anyone, but can't block a whole fucking cafe...
<CassandraSUN[banned]> hehe .. well many of SUN will be unbanned soon and alive and kicking :)
<Lum> Without having the UO source code no one knows for sure, I guess
<CassandraSUN[banned]> Kruse they can and they have .. lol
<Kruse> eheh i know they have
<Cloud[SUN]> not for long methinks
<Kruse> but they shouldn't be able to
<Cloud[SUN]> anyways
<Cloud[SUN]> smile
<Cloud[SUN]> im on the headlines
<Kruse> eheh
<Cloud[SUN]> i own the board
<Cloud[SUN]> what more could i want?
<Cloud[SUN]> :P
<Mierin[Blocked]> hehe ya
<RAK|KoC> Banning people because they play in a cafe is called discrimination
<CassandraSUN[banned]> yeah Charlie congrats on making head of Lums site :P
<Rubmywonka> breaking a tos has no legal ramifications
<Cloud[SUN]> :P
<Lum> Well OSI has no legal obligation to let ANYONE play, it's a private service
<Lum> so they can pretty much do what they want
<Kruse> oh btw...if they wipe Sp...osi loose account :)
<RAK|KoC> you can ban people for their actions not their being / specifications
<Cloud[SUN]> actually
* Monolo says Sun was stupid to dupe, it is plain and simple, if youd didnt want to get banned or suspened you shouldnt of duped
<Cloud[SUN]> osi sucks
<CassandraSUN[banned]> i dont think they will wipe ALL of Sp, just many of the SUN accounts
<Monolo> And lan is totaly correct
<Cloud[SUN]> because
