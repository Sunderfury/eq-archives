In between the various posts on what a lame fuck I am for having other people post their opinions (which is supposed in some twisted way to convince me to post more?) we get notes such as this:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">: This website has run amuck with you nazi roleplayers and your god damn opinions on pvp, something you don't even participate in. Stick to staying in your towers with some gay guy with a female character emoting sex acts to each other. </font><br><br>Emote THIS, motherfucker. With such idiots running amuck (this was probably the calmest of the many postings) why the hell would anyone <b>care</b> what the hell your opinion is?<br><br>First off, no one fucking <b>ASKED</b> you about precasting. It's a fucking <B>BUG</b>. I am so sorry if you built your entire gimp 7x GM Tank Mage around it. DEAL. <br><br>Second off, when the Lead Fucking Programmer of Origin (I think that's his job title) gets on the horn and asks "Hey, did I fix skills or not?" this is NOT your cue to say "Fix precasting you punk ass bitch!". Because even if somehow Origin would be convinced NOT to fix that bug (which they're not) somehow I doubt people acting like lame-ass suburban imitations of DMX, only with a high-pitched nasally voice and no balls, would convince him to look sideways, much less actually do what you ask.<br><br>I think you idiots seriously are starting to have reality issues here. Just because you run around UO emoting "ass rap3d y0u! B00yah!" does not mean that this sort of behavior works in real life. <br><br>God, with the intellect being shown off lately maybe we should just chalk up all ORPGs as failed experiments until the gaming public makes it to puberty.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name a sick fuck end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment--> Its funny when stupid fucks kill themself, I like to follow around suicidal people and whisper &quot;Kill yourself, you're fucking usless, do it...&quot; and when they blow their worthless brains out I like to rush in like a vulture and fuck them in the ass(its still legal at this point) and then I vut up their bodies and shove their eye balls up my asshole-feels real good. Then after the clean up I like to go out curb bashing in witch I hold a gun to a 8 year olds head and make him bite the sidewalk, when he does I proceed to fuck him in the ass then stomp the back of his head killing him instantly, if hes lucky though all he will need is reconstructive surgery. If this is the case I hunt him down and ass rape him for a few months until he kills himself...its fun and feels good too <!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email Grayson10@home.com end_email start_name Grayson end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment--> You know, I read the main part of Lum's site to keep up with recent news. I come here for entertainment. I mean, watching so many pathetic people getting so mad at a GAME, and then in turn getting mad at someone who is doing them a SERVICE by offering them information on it (And giving us his opinion), just shows how far along the evolutionary chain most of the rest of us have come. I think the rest of you forgot to get back on the evolutionary bus back there at &quot;Ape&quot; Its entertaining, at the least, to watch.<br><br>Anyone else ever notice that the people doing the flaming never actually *answer* a question with a rational answer? The one person offers an opinion on the issue, and a possible solution, and then the flamer jumps on and screams. Usually something deeply profound like &quot;u fat gay rp pussy!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br><br>I guess by being an rp'er you are pretty much doomed to suck at pvp according to the morons. News Flash: *Some* of us have both gaming AND social skills. Just because YOU dont have both, doesnt mean WE dont  :)<br><br>Just to laugh at a few specific morons.<br><br>SUCK IT: Right, good intelligent response. He insults your physical characteristics (must have hit pretty close to home to make you that mad, or you are just genetically defective) so you GO GIRL! Insult that big bad man right back!<br><br>BooZe:  Ok, so us rp'ers need to stop riding osi's balls. *Checks off Intelligent Commentary on his checklist*  Or we need to get some skills. Gotcha. So um, hitting a macro for exp, fs, equip hally, and taking two steps forward to instakill requires skill? But of COURSE it does.<br><br>Croissant: For Jesus's sake, decide whether you hate rp'ers or not! First sentance you revile us, third sentance you defend us? I mean, d4mN d00d, d3c1d3 wH1cH s1d3 oF d4 f3nC3 j00 aR3 oN! And wait, all we want to do is make friends, be gay, etc etc, but we want to take the time to build a dex monkey and pvp with him? You specifically say &quot;dex monkey&quot;, so im assuming you mean a pvp-oriented character, not just a warrior bunnybasher. Im sure that makes sense somehow, but unfortunately my brain *wasnt* pounded to mush as a child, so I dont get it. And if we found all that stuff so boring, would we be spending time doing it? Yes, *you* may find it boring, but then again, we wouldnt be too interested in standing at a bank telling our good friend &quot;p1mP d4dD33&quot; about how we &quot;raped that mofo&quot; either.<br><br>The Moron of the Day award goes to Julius:<br>&quot;dex fighting ain't a skill!!!!!!! <br>this fixing of the &quot;bug&quot; will only make dexfighitng even dumber..&quot;<br><br>Anyone who is bitching about something, making little or no sense (Id like to hear how fixing the precasting bug would affect dexfighitng (or even dex-fighting). Im assuming because with precasting, anyond pvp'ing will be using a dexmonkey or getting their asses kicked), using the term &quot;dumber&quot; really should take a long walk off a short pier.<br><br>Thanks for an hour's amusement :) <!--ktalk end_comment-->

I wasn't even aware of the precasting &quot;bug&quot; till it became an issue, and I do just fine, thanks. If you can't adapt to losing your edge, then fuck off and find another game. Everyone else has the same restrictions applied to them anyway, so doesn't that even the playing field? Or are you sad over lor sing an advantage? <br><br><br>Cause UO is the only place they can go and have names like PimpDaddy and Guld titles like Slut Puppy.  Add to that lots of bugs to exploit and you have prepub heaven.  Uo long ago fell to the children when Origin failed to take actions that everyother ORPG has done.<br><br>Thats why I went back to MUDs like Inferno (www.ke9.com) that enforce a strict code of conduct. <!--ktalk end_comment-->

He would knock the dogshit out of your little geek unlaid ass. HAHAHAH <br>It would be sooo fuckin funny watching him r00xxor j00. I would give my left nutt to see all you geeks cry like a bitch. You would A) Shit yourself with fear. <br>B) Run like a bitch to mommy <br>C)Kiss his ass <br>Remember he is higher on the food chain <br>BABY ITS WHATS FOR DINNER <br>Chubbers and the anonomous SUCK IT. Well can suck me! Twice... <br>I am PvPer not roleplayer, DEAL with OSI and adapt and overcome. You pussies would be a drill instructers wet dream with your bitching. NONE FOR YOU MAGGOT. <br>But I forgot you mindless fucks don't know how to think, lets see go to haxxoR US and find that l33t hack or expliot then bitch when they fix it, then cry when you get banned.

If you want to crush OSI's balls on something, that's what you need to complain about...not about how now you can't kill someone with one quick combo that required you 5 minutes to set up the combo and another 3 minutes of practice to remember which keys to press in which order. <!--ktalk end_comment-->

NEVER) intended for someone to be able to do anything else while casting a spell.  Not equiping a halberd, not looting bodies, not running around for 20 minutes trying to find a mark, well I think you get the point.<br><br>Think intelligently about the game as a WHOLE - not from your tiny perspective, and perhaps you might gain a sense of understanding on why it IS a bug.<br><br>-Ima Supa <!--ktalk end_comment-->

If you're such a witless fuckwad that your only retort is that he's fat, please do the gene pool a favor and suck down a pint or two of Clorox. We'll all feel the better for it about three minutes later.<br><br>The older I get, the closer I'm coming to the conclusion that post-birth abortions will be the only way to cure the disease we call &quot;children&quot;.<br> <!--ktalk end_comment-->

But they ARE the ones that have the P.O.S dex monkeys obviously, because we all know OSI caters to the RP'ers and treats the PvP'ers like TRASH.<br>And not all PvP'ers are cool dewds or l33t roxx0rz or whatever, that's like saying all the roleplayers are lonely souls who couldn't get laid using matchmaker international.<br><br>Just my two cents. <!--ktalk end_comment-->

More than five spelling mistakes gets the account disabled.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Shogun end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment--> Fucking beautiful.<br><br>This reminds me of when DD's house burned down... a lot of the fucking asswipes would post about how &quot;DD got what he reserved for giving us the rep patch&quot;.<br><br>Ron made a good commentary on how only a true fucking asshole would say something like this.<br><br>I also think this seeps over into what you're saying about that sort of behavior not working IRL. Sure, it may be somewhat funny if a house could burn down in UO, but I'd like to see that 12 year old on AOL live when HIS fucking house burned down in real life. Fucking shits.<br><br>Maybe, someday, people will realize customers will be happier without the kiddies playing. Maybe an 18 year old rule would be enforced (2 years from now since I'm only 16 :P).<br><br>I know it wouldn't take them all out, but a majority of the fucking asswipes that no one likes would be gone.<br><br>It makes you wonder whether or not the Dev Team has raised so much hell to get the 18 year old ruled enforced... but of course the money hungry suits at EA would have no such thing. Not enforcing this rule makes them a lot of money. Fucking assholes. <!--ktalk end_comment-->
