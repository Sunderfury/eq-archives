        was taken from it (click on it for a full size version). There's a cool

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) SUN itself has had little 
        comment. One member <a href="scc.html" target="_blank">posted on CoB Discussions</a> 
        that the immense wealth needed for such property purchases were generated 
        &quot;by trading with other players wanting things on other shards.&quot; 
        However, a castle would cost over 3 million gold, and it's doubtful there 
        is that much money on the whole shard at this point.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3) SUN's property in Ice Island 
        on Siege (2 castles) are now gone. Whether by GM action or simply turned

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know.. It's been an interesting 
          read the last day and a half. I actually have learned quite a bit from 
          it. I'm not a real big "rage against The Man" kind of person, but I 
          can see a lot of that going on here, and I suppose that's inevitable. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe it's always good 
          to try to do things nicely the first time. A bit stronger the next time, 
          then get harsh if it's warranted. I'm more than willing (as you have 
          seen) to skip a step if I get a flack from someone (as in this case). 
          If that comes off as Draconian then I guess that's life. I much prefer 
          the gracious approach... there have even been times when I've had to 
          bite my lip while writing emails telling people to stop what they are 
          doing, because a part of me actually understands it and maybe even agrees 
          with it but it still has to be done. In the end though had I recieved 
          a response asking just "why.. what's wrong with this?" I would have 
          been more than happy to explain, but still firm about the end result. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is my writing that email 
          going to get the Guide Manual taken down from everywhere? Of course 
          not.. but it is important to protect Copyrighted material. Read thru 
          the manual again and you will see a lot of the same information that's 
          up on our website. There are also some things that frankly I would have 
          prefered stayed internal.. most of which are commands guides use, etc. 
          The last thing I want is everyone asking to be "/buff"ed. I'm quite 
          sure most of you could understand this if you think about it logically.. 
          I also don't want every hacker in the world to have any starting points, 
          because we have better things to do with our programmers time. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of the day, I 
          don't send out a lot of emails like that exchange with Lum. If that 
          2nd email seemed harsh, well.. guess what I'm human too and just maybe 
          spending time chasing down stuff like that can get frustrating. It would 
          be nice if people like Lum would maybe send an email saying "Hey.. someone 
          just sent me this and I'd like to post it, but I'm not sure if I should..

          so that people can contact me with their details so that I can forward 
          this on to my friend at Electronic Arts Australia who is pushing like 
          hell at the top end to get us this server that is set to go at the end 
          of this year, money dependant of course(EA as you probably already know

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, you probably remember 
          a push some time ago for an Aussie server, but that guy just forwarded 
          the info to OSI directly, which, as you know, is probably the worst 
          place it could have gone. If you know what ever happened to that guy 
          or have the url even (if its still running) could you please forward 
          his details to <a href="mailto:mainesthai@hotmail.com">me</a> so that 
          I can get inc ontact with him? I am literally the liason between OSI

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the past day or so the 
          <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/hall/main.html" target="_blank">U.Hall</a> 
          has been flooded with talk from jealous people who have taken a very 
          "anti-AMT" stance. One person has even gone so far as to organize a 
          protest, not against any unfairness in OSI's system for blessing buildings, 
          not against the lack of housing space, but against AMT directly. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why are they doing this? 
          Because after seeing that "trash" that was posted on geocities about 
          Tiffric and AMT, they're all jealous of AMT's "l33tness". Now some are 
          coming out with "structured" arguments (that seem to change every 5 
          minutes) about how AMT is using an illegally placed building, using 
          vendors in a decorated building and profiting off of it, etc..etc.. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The issue of whether that's 
          fair for everyone or not is hardly in debate. Of course it's not fair. 
          What's wrong about all this, and what I take exception to is the fact 
          that everyone vent's their rage on the community-builders who worked 
          their ass off only a year or so ago to get their buildings blessed. 
          It is not their fault there's no more room for housing, it's not their 
          fault that the IGM's/Seer's wear sunglasses when looking at buildings 
          for blessing, it's not their fault that not everyone can have a "kewl-d3c0r@ted" 
          building. These are the community builders in the community, the people 
          who broke their backs, put up with all the asshole jerks who tried to 
          make their buildings a living hell, and beat their way thru the OSI 
          beuracracy to get a special building. They didn't do this for themselves, 
          to be "l33t". They did this because they believe that the community 
          needs buildings like that.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My apologies Lum, I'm not 
          blaming you or anyone else for this. I'm just ranting about this backlash. 
          I believe that now that it's begun, it will never stop. The new players 
          will constantly be demanding "fairness" and "equality" when it comes 
          to specially decorated/sanctioned buildings. And, I don't believe there 
          will be any more rest for the weary community-builders who occupy them 
          now that the masses have "tasted" their own jealousy. That, to me, is 
          a tragedy, and signals of a self-destructive element in the community</font></p>

        does not want to be equated in the public mind with the folks I'm about

        Church of Scientology</a> is neither a church, nor particularly scientific. 
        In fact, they are a fairly decent exhibit in how in America, if you have 
        enough money, you can buy respectability no matter how bugfuck in the 
        head you are. Their schtick is to &quot;clear&quot; your &quot;engrams&quot; 
        of bad things, a fairly expensive and somewhat invisible process. L. Ron 
        Hubbard, a bad science fiction writer who allegedly founded Scientology 
        on a bet, turned Scientology into a church/cult after its initial incarnation 
        as a health and fitness tool was looked down on by the Feds in the 50's. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you pay enough money to 
        Scientology, you get to learn more and more 3l33t s33krits. Pay LOTS of 
        money and you eventually learn that Hawaii was nuked 65 million years 
        ago and some alien named Xenu is fighting for YOU against other evil aliens. 
        Or something. At any rate, you had better hope I got most of that wrong, 
        because according to Scientology if you read the previous and aren't an 
        &quot;Operating Thetan&quot; (someone who paid in a LOT of money) you 
        will immediately die. (Possibly from laughing yourself into a coronary.)

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's a bunch of folks on 
        the Internet, some ex-Scientologists, others just really sick of lame 
        cults making lots of money, who congregate on the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology. 
        One of them started posting the SEEKRIT DOCUMENTS of the church, and they 
        started going up on websites.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Church's response? Sue 
        'em. They asserted in court that the SEEKRIT DOCUMENTS, in addition to 
        causing instant death to unbelievers, were copyrighted and those people 
        disseminating and distributing them were violating Scientology's copyright.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dissident's reponse were 
        that the SEEKRIT DOCUMENTS held a newsworthy value beyond the copyright 
        held by the church and thus the posting of them without profit motive 
        was legal.</font></p>

          it's Garriot, but he still made the effort to come off as a solid citizen. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, there's our boy 
          Smedley -- apparently the fricking President of a company, here -- with 
          nothing better to do than hunt down evil, rogue news sites and threaten 
          them with legal action. I mean, really -- "Is that Bad Cop enough for 
          you?" Who on earth talks like that? The only reason I'm remotely interested 
          in his game to begin with is because guys like yourself let the masses 
          on the outside know what's going on in there. Hell. If I pay ten bucks 
          a month to play Asheron's Call it's probably because I want to see some 
          guy named "Effeminate Sailor" rag on brain-dead leets or meet "Nighthawk", 
          not because I have a burning desire to replicate the experiences I had 
          playing The Bard's Tale ten years ago and kill laggy drakes. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As far as I'm concerned, 
          Smedley gave me all the reason I need not to give him any Gammons because 
          he attempted to play net.cop over his laughably awful training guide. 
          Maybe if you need to specifically address and outlaw "doodspeak" then 
          you're not recruiting through solid channels, hoss. What an awful ambassador 
          for his product. </font></p>

        a few things would have worked against my use of &quot;fair use&quot; 
        - I made the entire document available, instead of excerpts, and there 
        was no actual comments made regarding the document other then &quot;You 
        might find this interesting&quot;. Of course, to those familiar with Verant's 
        history of deep-sixing ANY insider knowledge of their game, the existence 
        of the manual is itself newsworthy. Which is why I posted it.</font></p>

        I did understand that once I uploaded the document, it was released. Try 
        as they might, Verant can't stuff the <a href="http://pvp.cjb.net/" target="_blank">genie</a>

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Verant does take some people 
          seriously. Or shall I say, they do favour some people. I used to beta 
          test Tanarus, also a 989/Verant game, and there would be the select 
          few Elite who would get their favour. It seems to me that Verant is 
          a basement company that came to fame and glory without knowing how to 
          handle it. I could be wrong.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> and please re-read my first

          President and CEO <br>
          Verant Interactive, Inc. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, normally I would have 
        many options at this point, such as studying John's first email searching 
        for his nice tone (B flat? F sharp?), checking my original .RTF copy that 
        I was emailed AGAIN for copyright notices that I didn't remove, or contacting 
        one of hundreds of net.lawyers who live for this sort of thing. However, 
        in between the many &quot;You go, Lum! Stick it to the MAN!&quot; emails 
        (which I did appreciate, and damn, you guys check this web site pretty 
        obsessively, since I started getting them within SECONDS of my update) 
        I got a pointer to this <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html">interesting 
        page on copyrights and the web</a>. The first paragraph especially is 
        of interest:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <DT><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) <STRONG>"If it doesn't 
          have a copyright notice, it's not copyrighted."</STRONG> </font> 
        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This was true in the past, 
          but today almost all major nations follow the Berne copyright convention. 
          For example, in the USA, almost everything created privately and originally 
          after April 1, 1989 is copyrighted and protected whether it has a notice 
          or not. The default you should assume for other people's works is that 
          they are copyrighted and may not be copied unless you <STRONG>know</STRONG> 
          otherwise. There are some old works that lost protection without notice, 
          but frankly you should not risk it unless you know for sure. </font> 
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is true that a notice 
            strengthens the protection, by warning people, and by allowing one 
            to get more and different damages, but it is not necessary. If it 
            looks copyrighted, you should assume it is. This applies to pictures, 
            too. You may not scan pictures from magazines and post them to the 
            net, and if you come upon something unknown, you shouldn't post that 
            either. </font> 
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So basically I have the option 
        of spending thousands of dollars to make myself the Defender of Net Freedom, 
        only to eventually <b><i>lose</i></b>, or to accede to Emporer Crush's 
        demands. So if you didn't get the file when I told you, enjoy that 404 
        File Not Found message.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What's the point of all this?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly not the file in question... 
        it wasn't really that interesting, although it did give some insight into 
        how the support program works (and I'm sure the GMs will be getting &quot;Gimme 
        a /buff!&quot; pages now). What's interesting is how none of this was 
        actually ever public knowledge, and Verant's reaction when it was. From 
        talks with other webmasters, 90% of Verant's communications with the player 
        community are in tones similar to what I got... if they post something 
        Verant doesn't like, they are summarily ordered to remove it. With the 
        undertone of &quot;while we may not technically control the Internet, 
        we do have more money to spend on lawyers than YOU do.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is there <i>any</i> website 
        out there, with the possible exception of the abysmally run, &quot;we 
        are the only professional UO and EQ website&quot; Vault Network, that 
        Verant even takes seriously? I doubt it, considering the pottery exploit 
        totally blindsided them and was openly discussed for weeks before the 
        offending patch on various websites.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem, it seems to me, 
        is that Verant sees the players as the enemy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no communication between 
        the developers and the players save brief unstructured chat sessions; 
        there is no accountability or even acknowledgement that Verant sees itself 
        as accountable for various destructive changes being made to Everquest. 
        It's their baby, and they'll be the first to tell you as such.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The way I see it, there is 
        only one moral way to respond, and that is an account cancellation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I plan to cancel my EQ account 
        today, and I urge all who agree with what I've posted here to do likewise. 
        CANCEL it, don't resell it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I harbor no illusions of this 
        having any impact whatsoever; I don't even count on anyone besides myself 
        would actually carry through and cancel their account. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, the morality of an 
        action is not dependent on its popularity or its effectiveness. What is 
        right, simply <i>is</i>. And I can no longer let someone, who sees me 
        and those who work with me as an enemy, access to my credit card.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Needless to say, Everquest-related 
        updates to this site will somewhat decrease.</font></p>

        last update also said a couple of things about Tifric of Atlantic Mage 
        Tower, namely that his tower was blessed because he was dating someone 
        at OSI and that he was going to sell his blessed house(s). Tifric sent 
        me a brief note that he was in fact 56 years old (which I can verify, 
        having met him; he's a dead ringer for Burl Ives) and not dating any GMs 
        (all of whom are somewhat under 56) nor anyone else at OSI, and that if 
        something blessed was sold, OSI would immediately debless it.</font></p>

        something people under the age of 25 could do. What you may not be aware 
        of is that not only do we now have Companions, we also have Senior Companions 
        and ARCH-Companions. Those SRComps have the same powers as SRCouns (I'm 
        sorry, I am running out of acronyms here), namely telestorming and jail
