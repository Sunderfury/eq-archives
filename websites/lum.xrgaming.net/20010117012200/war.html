          and uo.com doesn't even <i>try. </i>Their big moment in the sun was

          or two psychotic obsessive fanboys sending them email saying &quot;You

          da man! No, you da man!&quot;, they decided to go legit and become,

          you know, a REAL GAMING SITE. <a href="http://legit.themushroom.com/">I

          E3 where Joe T. Fanboy was pissy because 3dfx and Nintendo didn't

          treat him like a REAL JOURNALIST. That parody used a picture from

          their web site, cropped and altered, of said pathetic fanboy. The 'Shroom

          sent then a catty email saying &quot;take that picture down, because

          it's our intellectual property, d00d.&quot; Of course, the 'Shroom

          would NEVER <a href="http://www.themushroom.com/archives/images/barret0101.gif">violate</a>

          <p><font face="Arial">That gaming site did what ANY of us would do...

          they called in Marvin, the scary mascot from the future. Unfortunately

          he was busy, but Chet and Erik started busting the chops of these

          amateurs, including such scary tactics as rampant Sammy Davis Jr.

          abuse and posting pictures of Chet's ass. Again, I could never make <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/realnews.wc">any

          of this up</a>. </font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">In response, the 'Shroom posted a witty riposte

          that said basically that they were right and everyone else is wrong,

          because they are, you know, REAL JOURNALISTS. Oh, and they didn't copy

          the Onion's layout because, you know, the HTML&nbsp;looks totally

          different when you look at the source. I only wish I made that part

          up. <a href="thissucks.html">I didn't.</a></font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">The only proper response is to take up arms and

          fight the good fight, to stand up for what's right, because damn it,

          freedom is WORTH fighting for! We shall fight them on the beaches, we

          shall fight them in the streets, until this evil is driven forth from

          the Earth. Since <a href="britfest.html">I know Lord British

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I was on the small bank roof in Trinsic when I overheard some guys

          talking 

about how they had a ton of lvl 1 maps.&nbsp; I asked them if they would sell 

some.&nbsp; We agreed to a price of 1200 gp ea for 100 maps, and he gated me to 

his vendor, where all the maps were in the corner of his bag. I started 

buying them, checking the price of each one as I went.&nbsp; Well&nbsp; sure enuf, 

there was a map for 80,000 gp. I left, stored what maps I had&nbsp; and then came 

back.&nbsp; The scammer's name is Quinten and he said &quot;I like&nbsp; screwing people&quot;.&nbsp; 

I paged a GM and told him what this scammer was doing, and after several 

pages back and forth describing the scam GM Darwin kept the stance that 

&quot;that's not really a scam, more just being rude&quot;.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; If that's not a 

scam I don't know what is!&nbsp; It was obvious to me that he understood what 

Quinten was doing...&nbsp; Anyways I didn't press the issue.&nbsp; I was just amazed 

at the lack of good judgement GM Darwin showed in this matter.&nbsp; I've seen 

posts where scammers are punished and they're made to stop their scams, so I 

wonder if Quinten was just a friend of the GMs. (This on PACIFIC)<br></font></p>



          

          <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I know the Earth is going to fly off

          its axis now, but I gotta go with the GM on this one. Being a crook

          isn't an exploit, it's part of doing business in the great social

          experiment of UO. </font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are scammers in EQ too, but since

          it's so hard to actually travel anywhere, you tend to hear about them

          all in your area eventually. (Speaking of which, don't trust

          Battyrider on Veeshan. In fact, PK him early and often, since he's

          red.) This is probably another sign that EQ's economy isn't as mature

          as UO's. Let's hope EQ catches up to UO's level of larceny soon!</font><br></p>

where anyone who was banned was also automatically trapped. Tensions were 

high as a group of blue innocents stood outside the building conversing 

with the PK's inside. I, like many others, walked inside the building, and 

was instantly banned and trapped.&nbsp; In addition to this the foul 

language, verbal taunts and sexually crude references seemed overly 

present from a couple of the decorated buildings patrons.<br><br>I (like 

several others) paged a GM. More specifically for the comments directed at 

my person (not my in game character) and the general crap that was going on. 

With 20+ outraged people outside the building... the PeeKay's didn't dare 

gang bang any more trapped people. Doing my best (in the heat of the 

moment) I attempted to squish an explanation of what was going on in 40 

characters (the limit for paging a GM).<br><br>About 20 minutes later a GM 

appeared (GM Elowyn) who unbanned myself and 4 or 5 others from the 

building and then teleported us off of the trapped spot. Then in 

the following 30 seconds the GM deleted the 2 pillars (part of the 

blocking exploitation) and vanished. Fact is you can still be trapped 

there... there is a fence and once you are banned you<br>cannot walk 

anywhere... (building on 2 sides of you, fence on the 3rd and steps on 

the fourth). Now, what are the problems with this picture?<br><br>First off 

the GM never addressed the ban-trap exploitation of a supposedly public 

building. </font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Or how about the fact that this GM blessed location was intended 

for role-playing and not insta-ban mindless Player killing.<br><br>Next 

how about my original harassment call? In 30 seconds the GM clearly read 20+ 

minutes of text? The never addressed or messaged anyone... they showed up... 

removed 2 out of the several obstructions and vanished in OSI 

style.<br><br>Finally, what about the next person who was killed (only 5 minutes 

after the GM left).<br><br>Well as usual with OSI you swallow your lumps and 

carry on. Only today you don't... because you get a nice letter in the old 

email in box 'you got mail'. It says if you use the Harassment paging 

option again your account will be punished (gee thanks... I've already 

been a victim once guys).<br><br>This coming from a GM who didn't read any logs, 

didn't attend the scene for more then 30 seconds. Didn't fix the PK 

exploitation. Didn't address the misuse of a GM blessed building, didn't 

ask anyone there any questions. It is pretty simple really... I was being 

harassed (And when you are harassed... trust me you will know) and 

I properly used that paging feature only to have OSI throw it back in my 

face. Who is the GM (who spends 30 seconds on the call) to say who is or 

is not being harassed when they spend no time on the call? How can he 

legitimize anyone's claims when he asks no questions? How can anyone 

explain this in 40 characters or less?<br><br>Well I am not the only one it 

turns out. Several people 'got mail'. And well... not surprisingly enough 

several people are extremely pissed off that a GM who really didn't spend 

any time investigating or resolving the issues at hand. They pretty 

much said 'don't page me or I can have your account banned'. The whole 

attitude is disgusting.<br></font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a fair contingent of players who were 

not only subject to the untouchable exploitation of several KewlDewds who 

happened to have bought up (yes you heard it right.. they bought it for 

cold hard UO cash) a GM decorated building!&nbsp; and hey.. anyone who comes to 

take a look see (all the nice decorations and wow.. neat a statue!) can 

be easily banned and firewalled to death (you cant recall because you get 

banned into a nice warm firewall just waiting to kill you, your spells get interrupted and you are a

          super easy kill.. wow * flex * you da man Mr. PeeKay!!!).<br><br>So the solution is to send the victims a good old letter 

saying 'page us again with this option and your account will be banned'&nbsp;&nbsp; 

great guys.. well done.. the PeeKays are laughing it up as you make a 

total joke of yourselves...<br><br>Well... I figured I would share some OSI 

justice with everyone... Good thing I got my copy of EQ this morning... 

just in time...<br><br>* wave *</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/04/99 8:30 PM </i><b>THINGS

          THAT MAKE YOU GO, &quot;Hmmm.&quot;</b></font></p>



          

<div><font face="Arial">Not much going on. I promised some deep thoughts from my

  UO time, and here they are:</font>

  <blockquote>

    <p><font face="Arial"><i>&quot;Damn, you make a LOT more money from

    tailoring than anything else.&quot;</i></font></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial">So if you're doing anything else - mining, tinkering,

  fishing, PKing, adventuring, programming, sleeping... quit it and go make a

  new character with 50 tailoring. Oh, and I think I can safely say, without a

  certain Utility That Dares Not Speak Its Name tailoring is also the most

  boring thing one can ever do, and that includes listening to Celine Dion.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">Speaking of Celine Dion, has Canada EVER had decent

  musicians? I mean, the closest they came in my humble opinion was Rush, and I

  just can't work past Neil Peart's butt obsession. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">In Everquest news, Verant hired Brian Hook to lead their

  programming staff. There's an <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/articles/interview_hook2.html">interview</a>

  with him up already on VoodooExtreme, but if you live under a rock and never

  heard of these little game called Quake II and Quake III, he worked on those.

  Now, can you imagine Origin going out and hiring programming staff of this

  caliber? No offense to the guys there (Pandemonium in particular seems to be

  eager to <i>actually fix the client</i> which is kind of overdue) but Origin's

  hiring policy is hiring really young guys who want to break into the gaming

  business, already play UO, and have been pestering DD or the GMs for jobs.

  Hmm. On the other hand, OSI is actually one of the sanest gaming companies in

  Texas to work for; some of them are <a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/1999/011499/feature1-1.html">just

  sad</a>.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"> Anyway, Mr. Hook (or &quot;Grandmaster B&quot; as he

  likes to be called) had an interesting thing to say about EQ in particular and

  multiplayer RPGs in general:</font></p>

  <blockquote>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Here is a problem I see with a LOT of genres in gaming -- they appeal to a 

niche, sometimes a very hardcore niche, but instead of trying to break out of 

that niche, game companies cater to that niche and attempt to have the largest 

piece of that small market possible.&nbsp; I think this is actually going in the 

WRONG direction.&nbsp; Take a situation where EQ completely dominates the on-line RPG 

market -- what then?&nbsp; That's probably a user base of MAYBE 500K users.&nbsp; I think 

that's shooting a little low.&nbsp; I don't think it should be a case of &quot;EQ kicking 

UO's ass&quot; or &quot;AC kicking EQ's&quot; ass, I think that some of these games should GROW 

the pie THEN take a larger piece of it.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">My wife is a perfect example of this.&nbsp; She is not an 

avid game player -- she played Myst and Riven, but really didn't have the 

coordination or mindset to excel at a game like Quake.&nbsp; She started playing EQ 

because I did, but even then I had to help her through the first four or five 

levels of play because there is a lot of stuff that EQ's designers assumed about 

the player that simply weren't true, e.g. that they came from a MUD, MOO, or RPG 

background.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I'm not saying that &quot;dumbing down&quot; genres is the 

answer, but I do believe that MANY game genres -- first person shooters, RPGs,

flight-sims, military sims, real-time strategy -- could go to greater lengths to 

make their games more approachable to players that don't have a lot of 

experience in those genres or do not have the benefit of friends that can show 

them the ropes when starting out.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I'm pretty familiar with games, yet I made many 

crucial and stupid mistakes with my human shadowknight in EQ. Now, keep in mind 

that I had never played UO or EQ before I created that character, so when it 

said &quot;you are hated in most lands&quot; that was interpreted as &quot;prices will be 

higher from merchants&quot;.&nbsp; It wasn't until after I had spent a LOT of time getting 

to level 10 (and when you first start out,you don't know how to power level to 

level 10 in a few hours, so that took me a week) that I learned about the joys 

of being Killed On Sight.&nbsp; Part of this is because up until level 10 I didn't go 

anywhere but Blackburrow and Qeynos.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I could easily see someone investing that time to 

discover &quot;Hey, the SK just isn't for me, I don't like being killed and 

universally hated, but you know what, I just don't have time to build up another 

character&quot; then trashing their character and disabling their account.&nbsp; This 

doesn't serve either the game developer's or the player's best interests -- the 

former is losing a customer, and the latter is missing out on a great game 

experience and/or has wasted a lot of time.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I also made some pretty significant purchasing 

blunders. &nbsp; I bought a store bought weapon (axe) because its specs were better 

than my tarnished longsword, but I had no idea that I should have been saving up 

for a mino axe instead.&nbsp; I bought leather armor instead of patchwork or saving 

up for banded.&nbsp; I bought a small lantern, then large lantern, before realizing I 

should just buy a lightstone. Granted, for some players, this learning 

experience is the fun part.&nbsp; For other players -- the ones with limited time -- 

they'd like to maximize their time adventuring as opposed to killing fire 

beetles and gnoll pups so that they can save up enough money for a 

helmet.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">You can NOT take for granted that a player is going 

to make all the right decisions early AND is willing to spend an indefinite 

amount of time making up for poor decisions later.&nbsp; Nor can you assume that they 

have access to fan Web pages, newsgroups, or friends that know how to play the 

game. This is particularly important for a subscription model of game.&nbsp; With a 

non-subscription game, you have to worry about returns, and that's it. With a 

subscription model, you have to worry about returns AND maintaining a loyal 

subscriber base.&nbsp; So even if you made that sale to someone, you have to prove to 

them that their time is well spent playing that game, which means making 

mistakes somewhat recoverable and also by holding their hands at earlier levels 

while they learn the ropes.&nbsp; There is a common base of knowledge that most 

players have by about 9th level, especially specific to a character class or 

race, that could easily be imparted at early levels through their guild master 

or via simple quests.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Training missions, on-line help, chat servers, good 

documentation, and strategy guides all go towards making the early levels less 

painful.&nbsp; Some people adopt the attitude that your first character is a throw 

away character that you use to learn about what NOT to do, and this simply isn't 

a tenable solution if you want to expand past the hardcore market of a hundred 

or two hundred thousand users.&nbsp; If you want to entice and retain the casual 

gamer -- someone that plays for an hour or two a night, at MOST -- then you need 

to make the game more approachable.&nbsp; This doesn't mean making the game weaker or

&quot;dumbing it down&quot;, it simply means making some stuff that is obvious to hardcore 

gamers slightly more obvious to the casual gamer.&nbsp; It means teaching newbies the 

basics of the game with as little frustration as possible.&nbsp; I've met 5th and 6th 

level players that didn't know how to do group say or trade.&nbsp; I've also met 1st 

level players wandering around the North Karanas because they didn't know 

better.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately, hardcore players and power gamers rail 

at the thought of a game possibly being &quot;dumbed down&quot;, but that's because they 

have the experience or time to learn a game's intricacies, and they need to keep 

in mind that the vast majority of game players just can't devote their lives to 

a game.</font></i></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial">Thank GOD someone is saying this. One of my longest

  beefs about UO and now EQ is that they are both aimed at losers with no lives.

  Someone on disability or suspended from junior high, who is online 23 hours a

  day doing nothing but powerlevelling his character is already 50th level on EQ,

  after having 3 castles in UO. We're supposed to compete with him? Or just let

  him own the game? Bleah.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">OSI has said that their development efforts currently

  are aimed at making UO more newbie-friendly; hopefully they'll read the above

  and take it to heart.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">Or failing that, just hire John Carmack to work on UO2.</font></div> 

          <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/02/99 3:30 PM </i></font><b><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFF00">A

          MODEST PROPOSAL</font></b></p>



          

<div><font face="Arial">I know, I know, I said I was quitting UO. It's like smoking, 

I've quit UO so many times I'm an expert. OK, but here's some ideas I've gotten 

from the vacation.</font>

  <p><font face="Arial">One of EQ's best features is its pvp switch. It's not perfect, but the 

environment fostered is far saner then the rep system in UO. It has convinced me 

that PKing in UO is probably its worst feature. Considering that I used to *be* 

a PK, it's something of a paradigm shift. But running around EQ, you find that 

without the economic incentive for players to die and be looted, you see much 

less k3wldewdness, and more willingness to help each other.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">The rep system should be tightened in UO. How? Some very simple 

rules.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">No stat loss for reds, UNLESS their victims are blue. If they kill a blue, 

they take stat loss IMMEDIATELY, not upon death. So basically, everyone gets 5 

free PKs, then either they behave and fight willing combatants or their 

characters go into the toilet.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">Blues cannot be looted by players. (Monsters may loot them freely, 

however.) Reds can be looted freely by anyone. If a corpse is blue, only its 

player can open it up. Seems simple enough. (Also make the blue decay time a lot 

longer so they have a hope of getting there.)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">If you implement these two rules, UO will become a VERY different 

game.</font></div><p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/02/99

          Get the hell off. I'm sick of reading about losers who open programs

          total strangers send them in the mail and find out their next month's

          phone bill has $79,003.82 in calls to a sex line in Bulgaria. As far

          as I'm concerned, if you don't take proper care of your machine, you

          DESERVE to be ripped off and have your hard drive wiped. It's

          evolution in action, baby.</font></p>



          

          <p><font size="3" face="Arial">(3) I didn't download UONude. Hell, I

          don't even look at pictures of naked women on the net. For some

          reason, and I know this may be just totally outside the limits of

          imagination for a lot of you, I prefer actual naked women. They tend

          to be a little more interactive, and some of them are better

          conversationalists. If you did download UONude hoping to see little

          pixilated penises and breasts swaying in the breeze as everyone's

          mules run by in town, you need to turn the computer off, breath deeply

          several times, walk outside, stand in the middle of the road, and let

          the next car run you the fuck over, just so there's no outside chance

          of you ever breeding and polluting the gene pool with your chromosomal

          code. Failing that, go out and date an actual woman. (Women may feel

          free to replace this with men, in fact preferably other men reading

          this, assuming they stop drooling.) You might find yourself playing

          online games a HELL of a lot less. Whoulda thunkit?</font></p>



          

          <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Just so you are absolutely sure what a

          woman is, should you decide to go out and risk actually meeting one

          and talking to one, below is a picture of Uma Thurman. Thank you, and

          get the hell out of my yard. </font></p>



          

          <p align="center"><a href="http://www.windworld.com/mwalker/"><img src="http://stormcat.simplenet.com/uma040.jpg" alt="Uuuuuuuuma." border="1" width="320" height="240"></a></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">OK, now that we lost the drooling idiots (they

          clicked on the Uma picture hoping to see pictures with her face badly

          pasted on some nudie-mag scan) let's break down what's going on in UO,

          why I really don't care, and what else I'm up to.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Dr. TwisTer (see, I remembered the correct

          capItaliZaTIon of HiS NaME) posted a letter from an Anonymous

          Gamemaster saying that basically the Dev Team is giving up on UO and

          working on UO2 now. Here's my thoughts on the subject...</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">(1) No GM is ever going to write Dr. TwisTer --

          they'd need to learn how to use email first.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">(2) The Dev Team isn't going to tell the GMs why

          they're not working on UO.&nbsp; That is something like Bill Clinton

          sending an email to the postal sorters in Pawtucket on why he's still

          bombing the crap out of Serbia.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">(3) The Dev Team is actually still working on UO,

          as you'd know if you downloaded Pandemonium's latest client. It may

          not be player races and necromancy, but hey, what is. Oh yeah, in EQ

          you can be a drow necromancer, not that has anything to do with it.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Speaking of EQ, I still suck at it. I'm a 5th

          level Druid on Veeshan, which means I'm just high enough in level to

          REALLY suck... can't cast any decent spells, can't hold my own in

          melee any more, I just suck. Oh well, I'm holding out for 9th level

          when I get better spells. See, it's like crack. Just one more hit on

          the pipe, baby. On Rallos Zek (otherwise known as the PvP server or

          the Server that's Not Candyland) I gave up being a drow because the

          drow newbie zone is wayyyyy too crowded and started a troll named

          Lummy. If you see Lummy be nice to him, because he's not very bright

          and also because he likes to hurt people a lot. Trolls are like that.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Maybe later I'll comment on why there's nothing

          to bitch about in the People's Republic of Everquest, when the

          political officers aren't looking over my shoulder. Really, it's a

          good example of why sometimes harsh strictly enforced rules actually

          work once in a while. Kind of like adulthood, but with minotaur axes.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Also picked up Birth of the Federation, a Star

          Trek strategy game. Yes, I am a trekkie, deal with it (at least I

          don't have uniforms or anything). In MY personal version of the

          Federation, the Prime Directive is giving the beatdown to those

          annoying Ferengi. </font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">More later, it's real late and I should probably

          go to bed and get up and go to work and all that good shit. See? The

          page isn't dead! Just sort of zombiefied and without focus, just the

          way you like it.</font></p>
