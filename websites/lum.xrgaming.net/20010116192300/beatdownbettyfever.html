  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00"><i>04/16/99 09:00 PM </i><b>EVERYBODY 

    PICKS ON ATLANTIC</b></font></p>

  <p>Not much of an update today. Everyone is probably busy watching their new 

    800x600 client crash anyway.</p>

  <p>An astute reader of Senith and Ironwill's little tete-a-tete noticed that 

    while everyone jumped down Willy's throat for busting on TC, no one noticed 

    that <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/let-log.html" target="_blank">he 

    hates Atlantic, too</a>. I guess it's OK to pick on Atlantic, though, since 

    the real elite PlayaZ are on Wakoku. I just like that shard's name. Speaking 

    of karaoke, why are Japanese people given such a bad rap in UO? I mean, they 

    are the epitome of politeness when they PK you and steal your kills. I've 

    never seen a Japanese player trash talk after they kill anyone. Then again 

    I guess I have my transerv off too. (Doesn't everybody?)</p>

  <p>Another reader asked if I was going to put up a message base. Like I care 

    what you pinheads think! There's already 4,000 message bases for UO (all of 

    which Designer Dragon posts on) so go play there. This is MY yard.</p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00"><i>04/16/99 02:00 AM </i><b><font color="#FF3333"><font color="#FFFF00">LUM'S 

    GUILD KICKS NAMES, TAKES ASS</font></font></b></font></p>

  <p>Well I was too busy working<a href="http://uoportal.webtoys.net/"></a> to 

    actually play UO tonight, but in my absence my compadres managed to deliver 

    the Holy Whoopass to the most popular gentleman on Great Lakes, Michael Corleone 

    in a 4 on 3 (we were the 3). In fact, whenever you see him with whatever sorry 

    guild took him in this week, you may call them Beatdown Betties. Because that's 

    just what they have been christened. We at lum.webtoys.net hope that, in fact, 

    you will create a character on Great Lakes just to go find Mikey and call 

    him a Beatdown Betty.</p>

  <p>Do it for the children.</p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00"><i>04/16/99 01:40 AM </i><b><font color="#FF3333"><font color="#FFFF00">YOU 

    ARE A WHINY BABY. YES, YOU.</font></font></b></font></p>

  <p>As a result of the world (or at least the world Dr. TwisTer lives in) discovering 

    this page, I got some mail. Most of it confirmed my belief that <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/ap/ap_us/story.html?s=v/ap/19990412/us/prayer_circle_shootings_2.html" target="_blank">high 

    school students taking firearms to class is actually a trend we want to encourage</a>, 

    but there were a few of you with clues you didn't have to borrow from someone 

    else. One of them mentioned that the COB Dev Board needed &quot;nothing less 

    than a low yield thermonuclear bomb&quot;. I'm not sure why my little page 

    reminds him of COB's board, since the only thing remotely &quot;interactive&quot; 

    on it is watching the counter increment, but it's a sentiment I agree with 

    none the less.</p>

  <p>Look at yesterday. It was patch day. Now, everyone with their own IQ knows 

    that playing on patch day is taking your virtual life in your own hands, since 

    *funny things* tend to happen on patch day, such as everything you own disappearing 

    into the void. But if you tried to check COB yesterday to see if anyone had 

    posted what new <s>bugs</s> &quot;creative uses of game mechanics&quot; shrunk 

    your server list to just Abyss and TC, you would get approximately 9 skillion 

    messages on the order of <a href="http://cob.xrgn.com/devboard/messages/3339.html">FIX 

    THIS NOW!</a> <a href="http://cob.xrgn.com/devboard/messages/3314.html">NO, 

    REALLY FIX THIS NOW!</a> <a href="http://cob.xrgn.com/devboard/messages/3201.html">IF 

    YOU DON'T FIX THIS NOW I'M GONNA GO PLAY EVERQUEST, SO THERE!</a> <a href="http://cob.xrgn.com/devboard/messages/2945.html">PLEEEEEEEEZ

    SUCK!</a> <a href="http://cob.xrgn.com/devboard/messages/3268.html">FIX THIS, 

    OK?</a>, and the one <a href="http://cob.xrgn.com/devboard/messages/2766.html">message</a> 

    &quot;Uh, we're sorry&quot; by the dev team was number 12,942,291 on the list. 

    (Note that you can't read any of these messages any more since the UO community 

    posts about 4,000 messages a minute onto COB and it tends to overwhelm the 

    Commodore 64 that runs the message base. Of course if you actually clicked 

    on those links above you really need <a href="http://wallofsound.go.com/news/stories/britney041499.html" target="_blank">reality 

    therapy</a>.)</p>

  <p>I'm not sure what we can do about this. I have this radical idea of actually 

    using the little message that comes up from the patch server THAT IS SENT 

    TO YOU EVERY TIME YOU LOG ON EVEN THOUGH IT ONLY CHANGES ONCE EVERY GEOLOGIC 

    ERA to actually be useful and tell you when things are going wrong, but the 

    patch server probably doesn't have notepad installed on it, so that's right 

    out. I know that OSI has this big web site that cranks out Java and Shockwave 

    and style sheets and dynamic fonts and Kilrathi spaceships and <a href="http://town.owo.com/6.shtml" target="_blank">crazed 

    Mongbat warlords</a> but for some reason it always seems to be <a href="http://support.uo.com/cgi-bin/newstools.pl?10" target="_blank">a 

    touch behind the curve</a> whenever something goes wrong. (Plus all the ELEET 

    people only check the Update Center anyway. If that. After all, we DO have 

    Dr. TwisTer. And he just wants to serve the public. <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/images/notdates.jpg" target="_blank">SHROOMS!</a>)</p>

  <p>So here's the thing. In the future, whenever the servers decide to roll over 

    and die, the dev team will contact <b><a href="mailto:lum@webtoys.net">ME</a></b>. 

    I will contact those whom I feel need to know about what's up (such as my 

    guild members and anyone else who comes up with interesting bribes) and the 

    rest of you can <a href="http://www.cowdance.com" target="_blank">watch the 

    cows get jiggy wid it</a> until they come back up, since I will use my unearthly 

    powers to knock out COB's Commodore 64 during this server outage.</p>

  <p>Works for me. Because, you know, I just want to serve the public. <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/images/notdates.jpg" target="_blank">SHROOMS!</a></p>

    <p><b>89 YEAR OLD CAUGHT SELLING CRACK</b></p>

    <p>KINGSTON, N.Y. -- Brose Gearhart was due to spend his 90th birthday Friday 

      behind bars for selling crack cocaine. Gearhart was sentenced to 1 1/3 to 

      four years in state prison on Monday for felony crack possession with intent 

      to sell. Police said he ran a $1,000-a-week crack sales operation from his 

      Saugerties home and routinely traded drugs for sex with prostitutes. </p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Man, that's the way I wanna go out. A pipe-hittin' century old pimp daddy. 

    Screw prosecuting, they should give him a medal and he should write a book 

    with Monica Lewinsky. </p>

  <p>Also, you may have heard that a country called Serbia is trying to PK some 

    Albanians in Kosovo. House exploits may also be involved. Never fear, though, 

    the noted Anti guild known as NATO is on the case and providing the Serbs 

    don't recall out of Kosovo, we should see some hardcore pvp pretty soon.</p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00"><i>04/15/99 05:00 PM </i><b>DR. TWISTER 

    AN UNDERAGED IDIOT WITH GOOD TASTE</b></font></p>

  <p>Well chances are good that you are reading this because you saw the link 

    on Dr. TwisTer's site. (Hint: you probably want to ignore all the crap on 

    this page and scroll down to the link at the bottom.) While I still think 

    that Dr. TwisTer is a blight on the landscape that all right-thinking Sosarians 

    should unite and smite down from the mountaintop, I will note two things - 

    (1) I really have no idea how old Dr. TwisTer is - for all I know he may actually 

    be old enough to be a Smurf! and (2) Even though I disagree with him on almost 

    everything, since he was mensch enough to link me, henceforth when I make 

    fun of him and point at his bloated ego, I will capitalize his last name correctly. 

    Because that's just the kind of man that I am.</p>

  <p> Now that I have all the TwisTies' attention, I'd like to point out that 

    I love each and every one of you even if you are all a pack of exploiting 

    LusErs who ride the short bus to school every morning, and I feel that I must 

    do something in return. Stay tuned as our investigative reporters find out 

    the TRUTH... is Dr. TwisTer REALLY a doctor?</p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00"><i>04/15/99 01:00 AM </i><b>OSI DECIDES 

    MACROING IS BAD FOR YOU</b></font></p>

  <p align="left">Well, if you use UOAssist (and of course, no one does) you've 

    probably followed Tug's sad and fruitless attempts to get UOAssist ruled street 

    legal. The programming gonzo boys at OSI have told Tug that his program was 

    badly written and would reflect poorly on the Ultima Online franchise, and 

    pointed to things such as readme files in the wrong folder as proof of this. 

    Tug ploddingly fixes everything he was told to fix, only to be told at regular 

    intervals by an OSI representative that "yoooou must..... feeeex that too! 

    Diiiisqualified!" in a really bad French accent. Well, Tug must have caught 

    the GMs laughing uproariously in the background during his last phone call 

    to check if UOA was approved, because they finally fessed up that UOA would 

    be disqualified because it allowed people to run macros unattended, and this 

    was a bad thing.</p>

  <p> Well gee. Ultima Online has been running for a good solid two years now, 

    and they just now decided that macroing was bad. OK. If macroing is verboten, 

    first off they had probably talk to all those folks who write Windows automation 

    software (I think Microsoft is one of those companies). And while they're 

    at it, they should take everyone's pennies away, so they don't *accidentally* 

    jam into the keyboard and cause a macro to run. And they had <b>damned</b> 

    well do a shard wipe so that newbies don't wonder why they can never get past 

    45 strength while GM Buttwipes give them the beatdown the second they leave 

    town.</p>

  <p>If you don't want people to macro, don't make the skills so freaking tedious 

    to raise that people HAVE to macro. Hell, I don't know, flash porn on screen 

    every 10 minutes. Then the typical UO player would never leave his keyboard. 

    Ever. He'd probably ask the porn for a date. He'd have a meaningful relationship 

    with the porn. Eventually the porn would leave him though, and he'd go back 

    to macroing. Probably using UOE. </p>

    "Ultima Online" (he rocked hipdm1). Those lost souls hoping to rally to his

    BUCKS ON </b></font><b><font color="#FFFF00">EVERQUEST AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS 

    DEAD TROLL</font></b></p>

  <p align="left">Well, I was one of the first in line to purchase Everquest when 

    it came out (OK, so there wasn't a line, but I did call EB to reserve a copy) 

    with the hopes that I could leave the madness and codependency of Sosaria 

    forever behind me.</p>

  <p align="left">In yer dreams, Jack.</p>

  <p align="left">Everquest is like a beautiful, mentally retarded woman. At first 

    you're entranced, but then it starts to sink in that something is missing... 

    but if you could only put your finger on what. </p>

  <p align="left">The user interface looks like it was based on a web page on 

    GeoCities. Beautiful, stunning scenery surrounded by a butt-ugly control scheme 

    that takes up half the page. You can turn off the butt-ugly control scheme, 

    with the tradeoff that you can then not actually do anything. </p>

  <p align="left">I was first introduced to the Friendly Everquest Fascism when 

    I tried to name my character. No Lum the Mad for me... spaces are forbidden 

    in Their World Now! So, merely Lum and chastened, I started my plucky halfling 

    theif on the road to glory.</p>

  <p align="left">Five minutes later, after I died, I tried again. Ten minutes 

    later, after I died, I tried a new character, a Troll Shadowknight also named 

    Lum. Since the Troll city is so hard to find the exit to, his lifespan was 

    considerably longer.</p>

  <p align="left">We won't mention the half-elf ranger who fell off a tree, or 

    the barbarian fighter who was too weak to fight off a crab or whatever the 

    hell it was. </p>

  <p align="left">OK, I dug in, studied Stratics, and figured out how the hell 

    to survive more than five minutes at a time In Their World Now. It involved 

    bunny bashing. OK, I've played UO, I can bunny bash with the best of them, 

    dammit.</p>

  <p align="left">Except that, reading and playing and studying other characters, 

    the whole game is basically one large bunny bash. You just keep moving on 

    to larger and larger bunnies. (Some of those bunnies are HUUUGE. With big 

    nasty teeth!)</p>

  <p align="left">There isn't much else to do in Everquest. You can go on &quot;quests&quot; 

    which are kind of like the ones that NPCs in UO used to give you back when 

    UO started, only not quite as mindlessly stupid. However, the XP that they 

    give you doesn't compare to what you get by bashing 10,000 bunnies over the 

    head in mindnumbing sequence. PvP is pretty much nonexistent, from what I 

    saw. In fact really the only fun I had was watching the creature spawn points, 

    since the creatures spawned some 20 feet off the ground before running around 

    in a vague simulation of &quot;AI&quot;.</p>

  <p align="left">Crafts? Muahahaha. Everquest has crafts, and they are tailor 

    made to those who thought being a GM smith in UO was just too damn easy. You 

    can work for hours and maybe come up with some patchwork piece of tattered 

    leather that a troll MAY be not embarassed to be seen in. No matter HOW good 

    you are, you can never make armor as good as what's in the NPC shops, which 

    pretty much ensures that the player economy is going to stay firmly in the 

    toilet.</p>

  <p align="left">All the Everquest reviewers rave about how the game &quot;encourages 

    you to work in groups&quot; (in the same way Everquest encourages you to do 

    everything else, very similar to the way Serbs &quot;encourage&quot; Kosovar 

    Albanians to emigrate). While this is a fine and noble concept, in execution 

    it results in groups of total strangers, since even if you somehow could FIND 

    your friends and guildmates (since there is no ICQ and IRC In Their World... 

    hell there's not even an Alt-Tab or Ctrl-Alt-Delete In Their World) you wouldn't 

    be able to group with them unless you were at almost their EXACT experience 

    level. There is supposedly a valid reason for this, involving some odd MUD 

    term I can't really think of.</p>

  <p align="left">So basically I have an Everquest CD I can't use, an account 

    that keeps accumulating free days as 989 refuses to learn from OSI's experience 

    (&quot;You mean that having all the servers in the same place on the same 

    ISP is bad? NO WAY, dude!?!&quot;), and a lot of dead trolls. Maybe I should 

    get ahead of the curve and auction it all off on E-Bay.</p>
