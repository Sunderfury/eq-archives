  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Little in the way of updates the past couple of
  days (well, none really, if you want to be technical about it). I've heard
  some rumors fly past on housing changes that involve purging the hordes of
  items within them&nbsp; that you little pinheads seem hellbent on
  keeping.&nbsp; The guy who does UORobot put up a webcam of his robot running;
  he was then promptly <a href="http://www.uorobot.com/">busted for macroing</a>.
  This may of course be just a coincidence. UORobot always struck me as a bit
  too mad scientist for me. I do like to still maintain the illusion that I
  actually have something to do with how my character behaves in UO.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Speaking of which, in the whether or not Lum is
  allowed to play UO yet department, I logged on yesterday and everything was
  fine until a gargoyle showed up. Apparently the thought of actual combat
  taking place scared my poor little client, so it immediately Connection Losted,
  whereupon I immediately Died. This did not enhance my overall UO experience.
  So it's time for another 80's moment (and stop bitching about Vanilla Ice, I
  don't care if his hit was in 1990, he's still 80's to me. What I want to know
  is why the hell you people know when Ice Ice Baby came out. I don't.)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">I loved that armor I found :) While in the town of Skara

  Brea playing my Bard songs, the citizens would walk up to&nbsp; me and say

  &quot;Greetings Avatar, Thy plate armor makes ye look most Manly!&quot;. It

  even instantly promoted my title from &quot;Arch-Druid&quot; to &quot;The

  Glorious Lord Thunderlips, Grandmaster of Manliness&quot;. Man I love that

  armor. I was however a big target for PKs in the Proving Grounds of the Mad

  Overlord. One bastard named Werda ran up to me and said, &quot;Thy armor makes

  ye look most manly! ~snicker~, I want it! *TILTOWAIT* !!! &quot;. After being

  light on fire from the thermo-nuclear explosion I attemped to slay him with my

  wand, The Cane Corpus, but he said the magical words &quot;Kal Ort Por&quot;

  and disappeared. Just as he faded out, he said &quot;PS: Trebor Sucks!&quot;.

  I still don't know what that means...<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

  All in all though, I can live with the PKs with armor like that. Even the Dark

  elves of Marrowind appreciate the craftsmenship.&nbsp; Lord Wood himself spoke

  of my Manliness and send me on a quest to retrieve the 7 peices of the Destiny

  Wand to defeate the Demi-God &quot;Tarjan&quot;. I did suceed, but the

  Mega-Dragon teamed up with the Dark Savant and killed my faithful hirelings

  Iolo and Shamino. Man, I pretty pissed off, but I found a new group of

  adventured in Thornberry playing a irritaing gambling game called Flip-Flop.

  After Drittz and Dragonbait joined my quest things seemed much easier... We

  even slayed the Beast of 1000 eyes in only a slight scuffle.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

  Later our journeys took us to Phlan and to the the forest know as &quot;The

  Elder Grove&quot;. Many beasties did we fight! Cuisinarts, Bandi-Phoots, Blast

  Dragons, Creeping Coins, Brass Dragon-God, Power Liches, Balrons, and even

  Minons of Malangar. The rewards are trivial compaired my armor however. 49

  magic candles? Obsidian Armor? Diamond Swords?&nbsp; Bah! Junk compaired to my

  Godly Armor of the Whale! Nothing compairs to that!<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

  Ah, I babble. So is Godly plate going in UO2?<br>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">OK, I've been patient. I've been reasonable.

  I've even been ...understanding.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">But it's been over a week now, and I'd like to

  play UO, please.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Ever since ***THE PATCH***, my connection to UO

  has been somewhere south of nowhere. Step... step... thirty seconds of lag,

  followed by &quot;Connection Lost&quot;. Needless to say, this makes it

  somewhat difficult to play. Especially when others are apparently unaffected

  by this lag. It's almost funny, hanging around the Brit crossroads on Siege,

  watching everyone else's position via stop-motion photography. Until, of

  course, I die.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I don't know what causes this. I have ideas.

  Apparently part of the wonderous bundle of joy that we call ***THE PATCH***

  has introduced more client-server traffic. Um, this is bad, mmmkay? I mean, at

  some point in coding all those wonderful UOAriffic features into the client,

  someone should have piped up and said &quot;Uh, guys, not everyone is

  connected to the servers via a direct Ethernet connection.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">What's really peachy about ***THE PATCH*** is

  that it doesn't affect everyone. Some folks, mostly on high speed connections,

  report no problems at all. Some folks report mild irritations and the

  occasional disconnect.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">And some folks - like me - well, let's just say

  I'm glad Final Fantasy 8 came out when it did, because otherwise I might have

  to read a book or go outside or something.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Others blame Globalcenter. Globalcenter is the

  UO tar baby... when someone's house is broken into, 9 times out of 10 someone

  somewhere will blame Globalcenter. Apparently, to use common ISP insider

  parlance, &quot;they suck, dude&quot;. I don't know if that's the problem or

  not.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">I don't care. I just wanna play. I've been

  REALLY patient... but now I'm pissed. And I'm fighting back, in that special

  fruity-yet-masculine way that only I can.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">That's right. In a very special episode of

  net.terrorism, until I can play UO again, every day I will be posting

  snapshots from everyone's favorite decade, the Eighties. If I can't play UO,

  dammit, I'm going to make you remember the decade when I was able to get drunk

  and get laid on something approaching a regular basis.</font></p>

    amount of viewer/webmaster butt-kissing has been exchanged...<br>

    <br>

    Some folks over the past few days have been confused by a sudden, relatively

    jarring, addition to the Laws of the Land concerning camping at spawn

    points, starting with a GM enforcing afore mentioned rules *before anyone

    ever told people what the new rule was*, or even a listing of the change

    anywhere (God forbid the offical site).<br>

    <br>

    24 hours and a few cryptic, scattered postings later, finally we get a clear

    response from Brad.<br>

    <br>

    He confirmed the new rules (&quot;Yield rule&quot;, as some have called it),

    but also confirmed it hasn't been offically announced or endorsed yet. Seems

    a certain Guide or GM started jumping the gun and having their own noose

    parties.<br>

    <br>

    Now the law enforcement arm of Verant is in a sudden backpeddle, absolutely

    avoiding enforcing anything of this nature untill the brain-section tell

    them it's ok. I love this game...<br>

    you argue with a GM on any thing, they will quickly give you a warning and

    mark your account record. If you get three such warnings you will be banned

    <p><font face="Arial">There is no discussion, no reprise. Your banned and

    locked out of account. They also do not refund your money for the banned

    period.</font></p>

    </i>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This is true.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">We are implementing a new policy.</font>

    <p><font face="Arial">If a higher level player who would get no exp for the

    kill is camping a spawn, and a group of players that would get exp (meaning

    they should be there) wants to fight there, the higher level player must

    yield. The lower level group has the right of way.</font></p>

    <i><font face="Arial">This happens thousands of times each day. Check any

    named mob and you'll see a high level person there camping. They're

    everywhere. What, are you going to ban everybody? No, I think not. This

    doesn't solve anything. The farming will continue. Even if you do try to

    enforce this, named mobs are camped 24/7 practicly, whether the mob gives

    exp or not so you're telling any high levelers who just want to get an item

    to use (not farm) to fuck off and buy it. That'll make your customers happy.

    And besides GMs usually take an hour or two to answer a petition (if they

    answer at all) and by then it's too late.</font></i>

    <p><font face="Arial">Yes, I am telling high levelers who are camping a mob

    that is too easy for them AND interfering with those who belong there who

    want the item to move on and buy/trade for it, or to come back when a

    properly leveled group is not there. And while it may make some bottom

    feeders unhappy, I strongly believe it will make many more adventurers

    happy.</font>

    <p><font face="Arial">I understand that GMs often cannot help right away,

    and that this new rule will is not some wonderful sweeping solution. But I

    think it will help and is worth doing.</font></p>

  <blockquote>

    <font face="Arial">I need to clarify some additional things about this new

    rule.</font>

    <p><font face="Arial">First, we didn't officially announce it yet.

    Apparently, there was some confusion and a guide or GM enforced it or talked

    about it, and hence there was a post on EQVault about it. I've confirmed

    this and explained the details because I didn't want any false or

    half-truths floating about. An official posting will be made soon, and

    everquest.com will be updated.</font>

    <p><font face="Arial">Second, there will probably be an exception made for

    no drop/trade/lore type items which could not be traded for or bought by a

    higher level player.</font>

    <p><font face="Arial">In any case, the Yield rule is coming, but don't

    expect it to be actively enforced until we officially announce it.</font></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial">How do you &quot;inactively enforce&quot; a rule? Stare

  sternly at the evildoers?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">Of course, camping wouldn't exist if NPC spawn in EQ

  wasn't able to be plotted to the /LOC point. But that would take effort.

  Better to just punish people. While you're at it, are all those folks in

  rubicite going to have it taken away from them?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial">Further reports from the Land of Norrath as those who

  are still there check in.</font></p>
