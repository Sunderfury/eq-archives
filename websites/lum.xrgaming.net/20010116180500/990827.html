      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Got these two notes:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mourning the loss of a friend. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tis truly a sad time for 

          me. This week a dear friend of mine has passed away. I met him in November 

          of 1997. Throughout the years we have had good times and bad times. 

          Often we would fight and not talk to each other for weeks or months. 

          But still I have always come back apologizing for my ignorance in leaving 

          him.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ok ok so UO is not a real 

          person and it's not dead per-se. But I still feel I have lost a dear 

          friend. This game has been an outlet for frustration, a cure for depression, 

          a veritable fountain of friendship and brotherhood. I have met people 

          in game that have come to be great friends out of game. Most importantly 

          it brought me and my brother together from literally a thousand miles 

          apart. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have quit the game numerous 

          times and always I have come back to it. I look at what the game was 

          as of a week ago compared to its inception and I can see a huge difference. 

          The game had gotten so much better. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What happened this time? 

          Well quite honestly I can't pinpoint exactly what makes me so upset 

          about this latest patch. I don't buy the fact that OSI overlooked something 

          as simple as telling the people what they are getting. It's just not 

          believeable in the least. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm strongly leaning toward 

          quitting the game again. Only this time I won't be coming back. Over 

          the last 4 or 5 months I have had the best gaming experience in UO of 

          all the time I've been playing. A week ago I would have said the game 

          was just fine like it was and not to change a thing. Now I look at the 

          hysteria that OSI has caused in their customers. The apparent lack of 

          any thought at all at what we as the players (read customers) actually 

          want and I'm disgusted. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just can't see this continuation 

          of forgiveness for everything OSI is and does. I won't do anything drastic 

          like put my account up for sale yet. I'll give it a couple weeks more 

          to let everything settle and re-assess the situation. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Good luck and good night, 

          <br>

          Redhawk of LS aka (Matt) *if I remember correctly* :-) </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">---</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have warned on many occasion 

          in the past that big patches are big problems waiting to happen. The 

          latest patch was 4 months worth of work right? and yet I have seen mini 

          patches with more substance. Dont get me wrong here - Im not gonna slam 

          the dev team but they have got to get their acts together now. I have 

          voiced my opinion to them and I hope others will begin to voice theirs. 

          I believe that a patch every week or every other week would be ideal. 

          Each patch should address one or two issues - and no more thought put 

          into adding new stuff to the game. To much stiuff doesnt work right. 

          Too many people are getting frustrated because a feature that if it 

          worked right would make them very happy instead frustrates them by failing 

          to do what it is intended to do. The dev team should promise less and 

          quietly do more. Lady Moi asked me what I thought about the patch - 

          I said Honestly I dont care about it. I mean Im not a newbie (dont need 

          new haircut), I run UOA along with 90% of the rest of the players and 

          I spend 2 seconds on the opening screen so the stone look doesnt effect 

          me at all. I simply see 4 months worth of work for mostly stuff we all 

          already had anyway. That being said Im very content with siege so there 

          really isnt much the dev team could do to impress me further - except 

          fix the old old bugs and issues that Tal raised yesterday and lots of 

          others have been asking for for a year now. I intend to speak to dev 

          team members soon (hopefully on the BV show) and specifically ask them 

          - what are your priorities for UO? Sorry to see Arcadian playing EQ 

          - but thats got to tell you something - I picked up the game and played 

          to - something I never thought Id even have time to look at. All in 

          all the patch simply was an annoyance that I couldnt play SP one day 

          - but then no one else could either. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please - Ultima Online Dev 

          team - Fix the game, make it stable - do the dirty work of code cleanup 

          - your players will love you for it. </font></p>

        is &quot;the buzz&quot;, anyway? When I was a kid we got &quot;the buzz&quot; 

        from smoking handmade cigarettes. But anyway) is all about a game called 

        <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/">Shadowbane</a>. Slated for beta and 

        eventual release in 2000, what makes Shadowbane unique is... well, it's 

        being run by and for assholes.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I mean that in the most 

        respectful sense, of course. I mean, not only are noted UO community scourges 

        <a href="http://www.warcouncil.com" target="_blank">Zander</a> and <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/mcd/main.htm" target="_blank">Ronald 

        McDonald</a> actually running a <a href="http://sb.drtwister.com/" target="_blank">fan 

        site</a> about this game, Wolfpack Studios, the developer, is just jumping 

        up and down for joy about it. As they told Ron, </font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I looked at your sites, actually. 

          No conventional game company would ever consider including you as a 

          part of their marketing campaign. For this reason alone, we're excited 

          to work with you. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I firmly believe that we 

          have the opportunity to make our own mistakes, while at the same time 

          introducing the net to an entirely new breed of asshole... if you guys 

          want to cover us, lemme know what I can do to help. </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is roughly akin to Origin 

        hiring me as LadyMOI's new message board monitor/PR bottlewasher. (And 

        I would do SUCH a good job of it. &quot;Dear Twink. No, we're not going 

        to reduce stat loss. In fact, I'm having the dev team code in double stat 

        loss juuuuust for you. The next time you die, you will have NEGATIVE stats. 

        Buh-bye.&quot;) </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But wait! There's more! Here's 

        another tasty quote from the Shadowbane web site:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shadowbane - where the only 

          limit to what you can accomplish is your Imagination! </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well.. okay, actually, that 

          isn't true. To be honest, Imagination really has very little to do with 

          it. What really matters is how good you are at the game, how well your 

          character is built, and how much you're willing to bend your "morality" 

          to achieve power. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shadowbane - where the only 

          limit to what you can accomplish is how much you're willing to lie, 

          cheat and steal to gain personal glory at the expense of others. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not quite as marketable a 

          tagline, certainly, but at least we're honest. </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And more:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Question: Will you have trade

        the patch, as you, the reader, probably know since you, the reader are 

        still pissed about it yourself. (Either that or you, the reader, play 

        Everquest instead and are pissed about kiting being nerfed next week.) 

        There's been a pretty <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000247.html">active 

        thread</a> on our own gimped message board which LadyMOI payed visit to, 

        no doubt wishing, as one other poster noted, that the &quot;In Vas Hormones&quot; 

        spell hadn't worn off. Among her comments were the following;</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Origin didn't care what 

          the players of UO thought, then I would not be here now. Calandryll 

          would not be here. I wouldn't have had a budget to hire the person coming 

          in next. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All relevant information 

          will be dissimenated. And when it doesn't happen, like in this last 

          patch, we do a serious post-mortem to figure out why it went wrong and 

          how it's going to be fixed in the future. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">---</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know you guys are pissed 

          off. Believe me, we can feel it very profoundly. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I promise you that the unannounced 

          changes that got in the patch did not get there as some form of a conspiracy. 

          There was not a determined effort to hide anything from you. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was absolutely a miserable 

          failure of communication, internally and externally. We are going through 

          -serious- efforts to ensure that nothing of this type happens again. 

          We made a mistake. It was a blunder. It sucks. We admit it. I don't 

          make up cover-up stories. That is yucky and disgusting and it's not 

          in my job description. I don't know how to explain this more emphatically. 

          But I promise you that I would not, and the other members of the development 

          team would not, try to hide changes. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum, you are right.. Update 

          Center has been neglected as of late. DD used to be totally devoted 

          to it... when DD moved on, the responsibility for it was sort of up 

          in the air. We will get that back together. You can totally hold me 

          accountable for that. Both the testing stuff and the comments section 

          are going to be getting serious attention very soon. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main reason people have 

          been more quiet as of late is because of the changing of the guard. 

          (Not the only reason, but a major one.) It's true we've been burned 

          by releasing too much information in the past... hence the whole 'where's 

          that stuff you promised us' clamoring going on. I really believe that 

          there is a good balance between giving information about the development 

          of UO and not promising the moon while you do it. That's the balance 

          we're shooting for in the future. Not a total clam-up process. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't want this to get 

          too long and muddled. There were two points I really wanted to make. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. This was a communication 

          mess-up, plain and simple. Not a cover-up. <br>

          2. Update Center will be restored to regular, consistent communication 

          quickly. </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was also a UOHOC chat 

        tonight, and as you could imagine it was pretty gruesome. (I didn't attend, 

        as last time I was there the bot decided it didn't like me and spat me 

        out of the server.) Someone who prefers to remain anonymous comments:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am writing this during 

          tonight's #uohoc chat, and I'm beginning to notice a really annoying 

          trend (besides the fact that #uohoc has completely sucked in the recent 

          past). Basically the trend is to change things and add new shit, and 

          make fairly major additions, but never go back and tweak the changes 

          to make it completely right. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some of the questions 

          posed: </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Glamdring] *Ibn_Shaun* Increasing 

          the price of thread and cloth has greatly diminished the only advantage 

          of healing over magery -- it's low cost. Since the intent was to close 

          an economic loophole with tailoring and not to injure healers, could 

          you consider increasing the number of bandages created per unit of cloth 

          or perhaps reopening the Delucia cotton farm on Siege Perilous where 

          a large supply of free cloth is not a threat?</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> [toad] At this point there 

          have been countless requests about bandages, making them lighter, making 

          them easier to cut, giving you more of them, and I do understand the 

          reasoning of the question given the problems for healers that will be 

          created by this fix to a loophole, <br>

          [toad] but at the moment we don't have any definite plans for what will 

          change about bandages </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Basically they want to take 

          out tailoring as a money faucet, which I can agree with, but they apparently 

          didn't consider the other effects their change would have nor have any 

          intention of correcting the seemingly "lesser" issue. The suggested 

          solution of increasing the number of bandages created from a bolt of 

          cloth would seem to be a fairly easy fix. Am I wrong? </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Glamdring] *Shadow* Please 

          explain the reasoning behind recalling from a key directly onto your 

          boat, especially with the addition of snooping not revealing a player 

          now. Do you not think this will lend itself to countless boat keys being 

          stolen and those boats boarded immediately by thieves? </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[toad] To be honest with 

          you, at the moment, a bigger problem than boat keys being stolen and 

          boats being boa1rded is the problem with people not being able to find 

          their boats, which can be caused by falling off of a moving boat, or 

          just not remembering where it was left. This has generated a large amount 

          of GM calls of people looking for their boats. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GMs will not find your 

          boat for you unless you have a key to the boat in your pack, and you 

          are the placer of the boat. Simple fix, make it so only the placer of 

          the boat can recall off a boat key. Too bad it's not going to happen. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Glamdring] *Elowyn* Will 

          there be switches added to the options to turn off the small stat bar 

          tags that appear or possibly a switch to the "classic" UO interface. 

          Many people I spoke to would like to have more control over the client 

          and the information that it provides. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Runesabre] I have noticed 

          a lot of interest in wanting to toggle the mini-health bars. <br>

          [Runesabre] We can look into making a toggle for them but first I wish 

          to focus on more client stability work. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wouldn't it be f'ing hilarious 

          if it were discovered that the mini-health bars were part of the stability 

          problem? Easy fix: make all the goddamn changes completely optional, 

          and when someone has stability problems, find out what new options they 

          were using (as opposed to say, ALL of them)? "Let's see here, what has 

          changed?" </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Glamdring] *ImaSupa* As 

          the boards demonstrated today, reds not being able to instalog is very 

          unpopular. What about tying instalogging in houses to the aggressor 

          flag, rather than the character's color? </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[toad] It's a good suggestion. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...but they didn't think 

          of it while actually coding, and the whole point of this rant is about 

          the fact that they won't give the last 10% to make a change work the 

          best it can and we'll never see this, so this one gets listed too. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's 4 examples and the 

          chat's not ever over yet. Pathetic. Advice to the dev team: Stop holding 

          the #uohoc chats, in the eyes of many people all you're doing is making 

          yourselves look bad. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Basically, here's the deal. 

          Don't complain or bitch about anything that's already done. They've 

          made their changes, they think going 75% is better than going 100% so 

          we should take what we can get. I think I'm going to go read a book. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(end of rant, commentary 

          on other q/a's below) </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Glamdring] *deVoca* Any 

          chance of upping the range on tracking? Incoming names effectively gives 

          everything the equivalent of a pretty good tracking score. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[SunSword] There are some 

          interesting things we could do with tracking, including incorporating 

          the new arrow used for quests. That's certainly a valid comment. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, an arrow instead of a 

          text message. Does that count as an improvement for the skill? </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Glamdring] *Ground_Zero* 

          With the new patch adding many useful features (if it doesn't crash) 

          do you expect to see a decline in usage of 3rd party programs? </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[SunSword] Well, we certainly 

          expect to see a decline in 3rd party programs if they continue not to 

          work as they do now <br>

          [SunSword] And yes, obviously as the client is improved, I imagine fewer 

          people will rely on 3rd party programs. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Has Sunsword actually compared 

          the use of UOA's arm/disarm features to the client's arm/disarm feature? 

          I don't know ANYONE who likes OSI's version. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Glamdring] *Jynx* Any chance

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Glamdring] *Honorable_Brit* 

          Is OSI concentrating on the newer people that have joined or the older 

          people that have been here for a long time? This patch is nicknamed 

          the "newbie-patch" and it seems that things to come are going to be 

          for the newbies and not the older players. Are there going to be any 

          rewards for being an older player? </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[SunSword] This patch has 

          something for everyone <br>

          [SunSword] Yes, we did add some things to the game to make it easier 

          for new players to adjust, but at the same time we added many new items 

          for everyone </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yep, many new items. Anything 

          that used to be rare isn't anymore. Brittania is moving closer and closer 

          to a completely decadent society in which everyone has everything. Nothing 

          is interesting or valuable 'cause everyone has one. The exception of 

          course is housing, but that's a whole different ball of wax. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Glamdring] *chaos23* ok...I

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To Adrick, co-host of the 

          Battle Vortex real-audio show, and the Ultima Online Websites community: 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For nearly a year now I have 

          been one of the loudest critics of Adrick and his consistent stance 

          against the various members of OSI's Ultima Online development team. 

          I have subjected him to criticisms of his show, his ideas, and virtually 

          everything he has said which put the Dev Team in a negative light. I 

          was frustrated that people who were, in a sense, working in a service 

          oriented branch of software development, were going to be discouraged 

          - and the community would suffer. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This patch, obviously untested, 

          largely undeclared - there's something wrong with it that reaches far 

          beyond the odd "blackouts", the crashes, and the undocumented changes: 

          they have broken the trust between the players and the Development Staff. 

          Until this point, we always knew what was coming, and people like Calandryll 

          and LadyMOI were hired in order to listen and soak in the views, concerns 

          and opinions of the players of UO. They were supposed to help the dev 

          team determine what it was the players were most concerned about, and 

          relay those concerns to the dev team. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BUT... <br>

          Aside from the unfinished state of this oft-delayed patch, it is clear 

          that the "new" Dev Team is now taking a "Shoot first, ask questions 

          later" approach to changing this game. I, as well as many others remain 

          convinced that the failure to announce what was in this patch was NOT 

          an oversight, was NOT an omission, and was NOT in error - we were all 

          played for saps and now we know that when it comes to deciding what 

          to patch, what to add, and what to tweak - the voice of the player community 

          falls on deaf ears. They know that had they posted "we plan to not permit 

          murderers to log out instantly" - they would have been carried away 

          to the pyres and burned at the stake. So they made a DETERMINED effort 

          to HIDE what was being done. Siege Perilous wasn't the rebirth of Abyss 

          - IT WAS THE REBIRTH OF THE TEST CENTER! All shards will be "Hard Shards" 

          - that's the whole reason they are falling over themselves to make life 

          easy for newbies. Because soon, it will ALL be hard. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And through all these past 

          months, Adrick made accusations, thumbed his nose, wagged his finger 

          - inspite of my ridicule and taunting. I swallow the whole of my pride 

          and publically apologize to Adrick, to Lum, and yes - to Doctor Twister. 

          I now await the apologies of Calandryll and SunSword. They lied, they 

          hid the whole truth, and now they cover the trail with a convenient 

          "oops did we forget to mention all this stuff?" </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result of this debacle, 

          I'm not going to make threats to quit UO - however I take a step I swore 

          I never would. I purchased EQ on the way home and it's now on my system. 

          I'm just going to explore and see what else is out there. Maybe I'll 

          stay with UO, maybe not. But either way, I'm no longer a blind devotee 

          of those who have a stranglehold on Ultima Online. They have lost my 

          faith and trust. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Woo boy. Where do I start.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, we could start with the 

        <i>good</i> things from the patch. Being able to target health bars is 

        very cool. In rapidly descending order, it's nice that newbies actually 

        have playable archetypes to start with, it's nice that newbies get a PK 

        switch to call their own, the Starcraft-esque health bars are sort of 

        nifty, the quest engine may be actually somewhat useful once managed by 

        human beings and the Last Shard shortcut switch is a small bit of a time 

        saver.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sorry folks, that's about it.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK. What professional genius 

        deemed it necessary to block reds from instalogging. No, wait, I know, 

        let's force them to suffer stat loss by allowing people to kill them while 

        they're not logged on! That makes sense! And if they try to get out of 

        stat loss by macroing as a ghost, we can bust them for macroing. Harrr!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course for a red to instalog, 

        they would first have to actually log on. This has not been easy in the 

        past 24 hours, as servers went down more often then Presidential interns. 

        This is understandable, though, since after all this is an entirely new 

        patch being applied to servers for the first time... what? You mean it 

        was in testing for over a month, and being bug tested by thousands of 

        dedicated volunteers? Whoops.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's see, we have:</font></p>

      <ul>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a patch which apparently 

          went through QA while they were all out of the office watching &quot;Dangerous 

          Curves: The Autobiography of Traci Lords&quot; again</font></li>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">significant gameplay changes 

          which it was deemed unnecessary to actually inform the people who might 

          be affected by them (hope you guys on the regular shards didn't try 

          to open any spawned chests yesterday!)</font></li>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">evidence that, according 

          to the dev team, THE most pressing issue in UO development is crafting 

          a poorly implemented clone of UOA.</font></li>

      </ul>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, guildstones are 

        STILL useless (I wonder how many reds turned red simply because they got 

        sick of trying to fight with the interface while declaring guildwars), 

        there are STILL dozens of ways to crash the client, the client STILL occasionally 

        takes your entire PC down with you when you lose connection, there is 

        STILL no secure method of housing transfer, and the words &quot;necromancy&quot; 

        and &quot;alchemy&quot; are STILL no more than bad jokes. And I'm just 

        waiting for peope to bitch about folks who got their boat keys stolen 

        and the theif then recalling off the key to loot them blind.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Siege Perilous was the best 

        thing to happen development wise easily in over a year, and according 

        to interviews it was an after-hours project. The graphic enhancements 

        to the client was also an after-hours project. What the hell is being 

        done during working hours, then? Hell, from the looks of it, whoever is 

        budgeting the programmers' time needs to STOP and let them loose! </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, and this is REALLY 

        just wacked ol'Lum talking out of his ass again, this whole patch fiasco 

        strikes me as the result of a dictate from the Mountaintop. &quot;You 

        guys are taking too long in getting this patch out the door. Get it done, 

        and get it released... next Wednesday.&quot; Because from where I sit, 

        it's either the result of clueless new bosses who have no idea what is 

        involved in patching and debugging the living organism that is UO.... 

        or of a development team that STILL has failed to learn the lessons of 

        the past two years.</font></p>

          as they are the only ones I PK. Why on earth would I kill my own customers? 

          I make a fortune off that place. Also not one in my guild is red, it 

          is an order guild, reds are not even able to join. If any guild members 

          pk malicously, they are removed on the spot. Its hard to keep track 

          of 72 members but I do my best, and I have removed a fair share of members. 

          ICQ me if you have a problem with the guild, my # is on my vendor. I

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I figured id kinda give my 

          opinion to you on Thunderlip's little prob (not that you should care 

          ;p). It seems Thunder was subject to a little Gm abuse as well as 'the 

          items returing to there home point'. Basicly thunder runs around giving 

          other players hell because they 'unattended macro' *gasp* and he camps 

          outsides peoples houses and marks runes only to turn around and sell 

          them on UOMarket (go <a href="http://uomarket.com/cgi-bin/boards/siegeperilous.cgi?read=2188" target="_blank">look 

          for yourself</a> ;p). Along with the fact that his guild (including 

          him) abuse their vendor house by having solo people go into the house 

          and then someone boxes the door while a red jumps out and kills the 

          person right after the person buys from them. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know for a fact that GM_Auger 

          does abuse players if they cause problems (IE killing people after they 

          buy from your vendor) because i was abused personaly ;x. But ill save 

          that for another time ;p </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Okay, just to clarify that 

          the GM deleted the rare items himself, here is a quick fact list on 

          the magical disappearing Barrel. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) This is not the run of 

          the mill Barrel. It is a half barrel container that can only be found 

          when the shard first starts up. I've owned 3 of them since day 1 of 

          the shard. This is the only one that has deleted and I got them all 

          at the same spot. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Found in Dungeon Destard 

          level 2 on the first two hours of the shard. My others are displayed 

          at my Moonglow vendor and are perfectly fine. Why did this one disapear 

          and not the others? </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) The GM just happend to 

          stop by to ban me and just by pure fucking coincidence, the barrel (along 

          with 4 Break-in mushrooms, and 10 other rares) just disapear. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) A Mandrake plant was on 

          top of the barrel and it got deleted too. Again, I have others in my 

          other house, and they are fine. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5) The gold and house key

          Somone obviously pulled them out. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Okay, its pretty self explanitory 

          on what happened. I was macroing, I got caught. The GM saw the rare 

          items in the barrel. Since all macroers are evil incarnate, he decides 

          to be Mr Dickhead and delete my items since he come up with some lame

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Arcadian Del Sol schooled me 

        on the proper use and abuse of spawning barrels...</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Containers found in dungeons, 

          gypsy camps, and orc camps can and *WILL* return to their home the next 

          time that "event" spawns again. It's not something manually done by 

          a GM. I personally had a barrel full of magic weapons that vanished. 

          When I paged a GM, I was informed at that time (this was about 7months 

          ago) that the barrel had "gone home" to whever that "event" had respawned 

          on the shard. When I asked what became of my personal items in the barrel, 

          he said that whoever found the spawned event would find the barrel with 

          my stuff in it. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, the knee-jerk reaction 

          seems to be "blame the GMs because they like to screw over the players."

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seriously, it looks like the 

        GM is guilty mainly of not expressing themself clearly. It looks like 

        someone may have found Mr. Lips' barrel in a bandit spawn or something 

        and paged a GM about all the stuff they found in it. That's my guess, 

        and it's as good as any as we're likely to get.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This just what you want to 

          hear in the morning when you wake up. A GM just deleted a TON or rare 

          items in my house (12-20 of them). Here is the email my house partner 

          send me. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--- </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am in shock right now. 

          These are the events as I have seen them. 8ish, I come to the house, 

          you are there macroing, I drop some stuff off. Everything is normal. 

          I come back about 10:10pm (pst), you are gone and the SECURE water tub 

          is gone too, along with the mandrake plant on top of it. On the floor 

          is the 450 gold that was in the tub, and the house key that was in there 

          too. No sign of all the rares that were in the tub. I page a GM. Heres 

          the transcript: </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zodiac: Please my secure 

          chest disappeared but some things are here, some aren't </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gm_Auger: was it a barrel 

          taken from a npc location? </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zodiac: it was a water tub, 

          but some of the things are here, most are not. my many rares, are gone 

          and there was a mandrake plant on top of it. thats gone too! s</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gm_Auger: all those items 

          were returned to their home locations, which they do from time to time 

          I made sure that your items were taken out before this happened. as 

          someone paged on </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gm_Auger: I would suggest 

          NEVER storing important items in dock barrels, dungeon barrels, or any 

          object like this as they will return to their Home location over time 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gm_Auger: the same can occur 

          for any item that was spawned with the game map (decorations and the 

          like) but these since they leave on their own </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zodiac: what do you mean? 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zodiac: who moved the gold? 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gm_Auger: are not as bad 

          as losing barrels full of items. Yes, I saved your gold and key and 

          the items were returned to their Home locations, locked down. The secure 

          containers and Lockdowns have been readded to your house </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zodiac: when did you move 

          the gold? It was here when I arrived </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(no response) *repage* wait 

          15 minutes, no response (first response took 30 seconds) </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*repage again* no response 

          now after 15 more minutes... </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thunder, i don't know what 

          to say man... I'm pissed off at this, i don't know what happened, i 

          dont know what Gm Auger means by "someone paged", Idon't know what he 

          means when he says he "moved the gold", for if he moved the gold, he 

          moved the rares too... and i'm sorry as I feel responsible for all your 

          rares that were lost. and Gm_Auger STILL won't come and talk to me... 

          all I can say is this sucks. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">---- </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since I got a lovely 48 hour 

          ban for macroing as well and I trust Zodiac very much, I know he is 

          not BSing me. Now the "npc" barrel was taking from the dungeon which 

          was never locked down on any shard, also other people on Siege have 

          them in there house. Have you EVER heard of GM deleting a bag full or 

          rare items? I swear to God these guys have it out for me. </font></p>

          Planned, no.. just to be honest. We want to keep the game smooth and 

          the back-ups short, and all the issues with housing and extended land 

          contribute to those factors, so.. its hard to please everyone. Some 

          changes you might want to look for in the future are changes to boats

          to lag and to bandwidth.. For us, we are trying to make a world which 

          players don't need to macro to get ahead, but that's just from our perspective.
