      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Origin implemented another 
        patch today. Shortly thereafter all the shards moaned quietly, rolled 
        around in the dirt, and finally laid on their backs, legs and arms sticking 
        straight up into the air. The intrepid OSI Quick Response Team is holding 
        smelling salts under the servers' noses as we speak, and I have word from 
        reliable sources that they are beginning to twitch.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Origin also said things about 
        houses. Apparently the new policy is that housing placed using stacking 
        exploits falls under the &quot;Don't ask, don't tell&quot; rule, but some 
        time in the future a house may be deleted, if it was illegally placed, 
        unless it wasn't. No one understood what they meant, including apparently 
        the dev team. As Sunsword put it on the Dev Board,</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think it would be wise 
          at this point not to overreact to the housing announcement. The point 
          is, we are going to give you plenty of warning about any such change

          illegal houses...</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We recently opened the new 
          Korean shard (named Arirang) to our 1,500 Australian customers after 
          getting reports that the connectivity might be better than to the west 
          coast of the United States. Please try your connection to Arirang using 
          the UOTrace utility (available at http://www.uo.com/downloads.html). 
          Anytime you are experiencing packet loss in your connection to any shard, 
          you should use this tool and send the trace route to uotrace@owo.com. 
          This will help us identify and resolve connection problems between you 
          and the shard. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you do not see Arirang 
          in the shard list on your Ultima Online software, please send an email 
          to australia-server@owo.com. Be sure to include your user name (never 
          send anyone your password!) so we can ensure you do get access. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are working with EA Australia 
          on the possibilities for a true Australian-based shard. There are many 
          issues involved in this decision, and the thing you can do to help us 
          most is let us know at australia-server@owo.com the email addresses 
          of any friends whom you believe would join Ultima Online on a local 
          server. This list of emails would be used no more than twice: once for 
          a survey and once if we announced a local shard, if we are able to put 
          one up. Local shards require a significant number of subscribers to 
          support, and with your help we hope to grow the subscriber base sufficiently 
          to establish an Aussie shard. </font></p>

        cheap). I also strongly suspect that Australia will be one of the first 
        places Verant launches a new outside-the-US server in (rumor has it they 
        are rolling out Euro and Asian servers to coincide with the expansion 
        pack next year). </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="bcrowder@origin.ea.com">Krelin</a>, 
        a previously unknown Dev team member, got jiggy wid the <a href="http://cob.xrgaming.net/cgi/devboard.cgi?view" target="_blank">Dev 
        Board</a> today. Here's some highlights.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wanted to let you guys know 
          that we're working on the connections problems with the most recent 
          patch. I think we have a solid fix that should go in, within the next 
          couple of days.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Swell. I have only been 
          kicked 4 times on SP today maybe things are getting better. </i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks for hoping, but things 
          won't really get better until the next client patch. This is an issue 
          that effects both the client and the server simultaneously, but is revealed 
          only under high-load situations on the server (and usually only if the 
          client has a pretty good link).</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eloquent words for saying, 
          "That patch sure sucked..."</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 1999 standards, maybe 
          :) Certainly this patch was not of the quality you should be able to 
          expect from our team, and while I won't offer any excuses for it, I 
          also think that it was remarkably successful considering the number 
          of massive changes and additions that went in to it. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I sincerely hope you'll give 
          us some leeway on this patch while it settles. The next few months should 
          (we all hope) be better. :) </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>What about the massive 
          timewarps?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Believe me, we're spending 
          every cycle we've got on this one, but from-the-hip I think there are 
          several factors contributing to this problem: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) A large number of people 
          are (for various reasons which I'm sure you well know) generating huge 
          amounts of objects in the world, which cause the worlds to require more 
          memory than they normally would. This is being attacked in the next 
          few days; but it has to be addressed carefully, because we don't want 
          to injure players that aren't aggressively attacking the world mechanics. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Because of the breadth 
          and depth of what is saved in the world state over the past two years, 
          our world is becoming very large. One of our tasks over the next couple 
          of weeks is to find new ways to shrink this data without losing it. 
          :) </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) Some of the new accessibility 
          features and code require more memory than has previously been required. 
          A lot of this new stuff isn't visible to you guys as it is mostly in 
          place in PREPARATION for things to come. We still need to bring this 
          usage down; because the excessive memory requirements are causing instability 
          in the server (which you experience as crashes and warps). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Why not make multiple 
          piles of gold unstackable? I mean all those people you are talking about 
          are mostly using gold to create those huge item numbers that causes 
          prbs to the shard. If you can't stack gold piles anymore (and most of 
          the time they are 1gp piles) then it will be a prb. Maybe add that restriction 
          to fish steaks and bandages and that should make things really hard 
          </i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reason we haven't done 
          this yet is because the physics of the world (both client-side and server-side) 
          aren't defined the way you think they are. :) It's hard to explain, 
          but a variety of factors contribute to making this a more difficult 
          problem, but I _believe_ the proposed solution is pretty close to this.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Are you a new PR hire?</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No, I've been on the dev 
          team for a while. Today is the first time I've felt the urge to post. 
          I've seen some really thoughtful posts today. :) And I fixed the CL 
          problem (I hope). :) </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SUN is still around, in case 
        you still cared. (I don't.) Apparently many of them were on 48 hour temp 
        bans which expired, and are busily crowing about how they did nothing 
        wrong and 0wN uS aLl. Of course, I don't imagine they'll be too terribly 
        popular when wandering around Sosaria. Not that I'm suggesting any course 
        of action (kill them all) or anything (kill them all) like that (kill 
        them all). That would be (kill them all) wrong.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moving on to the aftermath, 
        drtwister.com has actually been an interesting read the last few days, 
        for those interested in human dynamics at any rate. Basically the Minions 
        and Henchmen of The Dr. Twister NeTwork, Inc. (MHTDTNTI - ah hell, just 
        call 'em Twisties) are in disagreement, between the Post The Damn Dupe 
        faction and the Um, That Would Wreck UO faction. The Post The Damn Dupe 
        faction apparently won, and the details of the dupe are slowly starting 
        to leak into the dewdish consciousness, as anyone who tried playing UO 
        through the monstrous lag this weekend could tell.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My take? Well, glad you asked.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. TwisTer posted that his 
        job was to post bugs, and implied that it was the best thing for your 
        own protection (yes, you), since most people check his site to protect 
        themselves against other bug exploiters and &quot;only a few&quot; seek 
        to use them for their own gain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Um, *koff koff* BULLshit. No 
        one wants to know how to dupe &quot;to protect themselves&quot;. How do 
        you protect yourself against a dupe? Dupe yourself? The only people who 
        wanted to know how to dupe were people who wanted to dupe. Period. End 
        of sentence. Any sort of highminded sentiments, such as &quot;This is 
        for your own protection&quot; and even better &quot;This will force Origin 
        to fix the dupe bug&quot; (um, I think they already have it pretty high 
        on their priority list) are just crap. It smells like crap, it looks like 
        crap, and I sure in hell ain't eating it. Dr TwisTer proved, to the three 
        people who weren't already convinced, that he cares more about his &quot;rep&quot; 
        with the kEwLdEwD community than for the game (if you believe his press 
        releases) that he so valiantly and heroically tries to save. So now, thanks 
        to the details of the dupe being out, we now have every shard crashing 
        and burning on a regular basis and lagged to hell and back when actually 
        up and running from I0WnZj0o trying to manufacture 30000 castle deeds. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, Origin has been 
        fairly quiet. I only hope it is because they are knee deep in source code, 
        and not because they took a page from Verant's book and decided that the 
        loudest 5% of the community no longer needed to be coddled.</font></p>

          Tonight on Veeshan all of a sudden my guildmates start getting CRAZY 
          offers, like 7000pp for a runed mithril bracer. I go to freeport and 
          people are examining my equip and offering me 15,000pp for my rubi BP, 
          10,000pp and items for my crested helm, there are people auctioning

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My guildmates confirmed there 
          is a bug, it involves killing something in butcherblock repeatedly, 
          and you can make 10,000pp an hour or a day, unsure which. I reported 
          it with petition and was quizzed by two guides, so this might not be 
          a scoop anymore. :) Anyway suffice it to say that there is a good chance 
          that not only is platinum now VALUELESS in EQ, but also (a) the player-based 
          economy is hopelessly fucked up and (b) everyone is going to have some

        continues. Vapor of drtwister.com posted why he wouldn't post the dupe, 
        immediately followed by Dr. TwisTer of drtwister.com who said he would. 
        (Check the <a href="http://uo.drtwister.com/" target="_blank">twisted 
        site</a> for details.) What do I think? Well, it's obvious, since I <i>know 
        </i>what the dupe was (yes, Dr. TwisTer, I do know, I'm not lying about 
        it, and believe it or not there may actually be a dupe out that you don't 
        know about) and I haven't posted it. Essentially for the same reasons 
        that Vapor posted. I can understand why Twister would say what he would 
        - what's a bug site that doesn't post bugs?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On that same subject, Soldier 
        SUN writes:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is my first public speaking 
          about the incident to date. Ive had a few impersonators, but thats another 
          story. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is all real funny, I 
          think so anyway. First and foremost, I think Lum the Mad and DrTwisTer's 
          people, and all of the other anti-social, bug, powergaming, alternative, 
          and PK sites that have badmouthed SUN are hypocrites, not to mention 
          biased and two-faced (Lum this ones for you :)). You *know* you really 
          did something special when your fellow lackies are pointing the finger 
          at you and saying ban (anyone remember when DrT's website was straight 
          bugs for the people? nothing held back? screw OSI? ahh.. good memories). 
          But honestly, had Vapor of DrTwisTer's site discovered the bug, he'd 
          be duping right now, even though he thinks it was so horribly wrong. 
          99% of CoB discussion board would dupe if they could or accept duped 
          items, if they knew there wasnt a good chance of getting caught. Thats 
          where the irony is. Not one of you out there in UO land, except the 
          most dedicated roleplayers, can truthfully deny this. But its okay.. 
          no really, everything is just fine.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The bannings.. well, the 
          bannings were interesting. Last I heard I believe 40+ accounts have 
          been blocked/banned. Three people actually participated in duping. 15 
          or so people have used the duped items. This adds up to .. 22 innocent 
          people banned. Possibly more if you consider people who used duped items 
          without knowing it (on the contrary to what you may believe, none of 
          the SUN members knew or saw the castle(s) or the plethora of regs [except 
          for the few who exploited]. The most *I* saw, was a few thousand regs 
          and a tower, which all couldve been legally bought [not saying it was], 
          and definantly lied about to fellow members in a believable way.) To 
          those who dont believe it couldve been earned, im sure there's plenty 
          of SP players that would admit to seeing us in levels 2-4 of Shame nearly 
          all day. Not to mention 5 red members that had been amassing quite a 
          fortune from PKing (30k arrows? oh thats about.. 90 archers looted? 
          in 3 weeks? VERY possible.. with even 1 PKer). My point? Most members 
          like myself didnt think it was duped, especially since we had been working 
          our butts off in Shame together since day 1. So when we were lied to, 
          we: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a) Didnt suspect we'd be 
          lied to by our own guildmates. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b) Didnt consider a dupe 
          since we never saw half of what was duped (including castles and mountains 
          of regs). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c) Figured that it was all 
          paid for. Lies included all of the SP gold on the eBay market being 
          bought for real money, all of the PK loot being invested and sold for 
          gold, and all of our guildtrip hunting money saved (which was quite 
          a lot i might add), and a combination of all 3. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*IF* You would have bought 
          all the SP gold on the market (I was told a SUN member owned a business 
          and bought it all), sold all the PK loot youve recieved (countless suits 
          of GM armor selling at 1k for 2 sets, not including magical weapons 
          and armor that can sell for 10k by themselves), and all of the guildtrip 
          money (6k per person per 45 minutes, 5 hours a day, 5 days a week, 1 
          week after the shard being official, 20+ members participating), you'd 
          have quite a bundle of cash. Probubly easily enough to buy a tower at 
          3x the cost and a couple thousand of each reg. And this is what we were 
          led to believe. Did I suspect a dupe? The idea floated around in the 
          back of my mind once or twice, but I figured that it just isnt possible 
          to do such a thing anymore, and I knew the guild wouldnt lie to itself 
          (or so I thought). So what we have here isnt SUN whining because they 
          got banned, but because they simply didnt even know what the hell was 
          going on. Honestly, I was standing in the tower with a few people and 
          suddenly I'm told to resign and next thing I know everything's being 
          destroyed and everyone's going nuts. No one knew what had happened until 
          they saw the pics for themselves, needless to say, we were suprised. 
          (To this day no one captured a screen shot or location of our SP tower.) 
          Did I get banned/blocked? Yes. I'm currently under suspension .. will 
          it become a ban? who knows.. who cares.. not me. Again, more irony. 
          I thinks it's pretty funny that the unaffected people are getting more 
          bent over this subject than SUN themselves. I can speak for myself when 
          I say I honestly dont care what happens. I also know many of the other 
          SUN honestly don't care what happens, or if they got banned. UO is a 
          dying game for me anyway .. SP was the only reason I had reactivated 
          my account to begin with, same goes for most of the other SUNs. If my 
          account doesnt get banned permanently, I'd probubly quit playing anyways, 
          although I havent decided. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who laughs last? Good question. 
          If the masses werent screaming "KILL EM ALL!" and waving their pitchforks 
          in the air I'd probubly feel sympathetic if/when the shard gets wiped. 
          But of course I'm spit upon for knowing someone who decided they should 
          dupe, can't really say I expected anything different. One thing remains 
          true, and that is that SUN has recieved so much negative attention that 
          we're going down in the UO history books as the most infamous guild 
          ever. Cant really complain about that you know.. what more could a PK 
          guild ask for. From recieving this much publicity to watching OSI try 
          to deal with the problem effectively only to fail horribly, its all 
          been a great laugh and a good read. Even the UO addicts pressing for 
          real life lawsuits crack me up. Talk about too much UO. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bottom line of my entire 
          arguement is simple, theres 2 parts actually. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">40+ players whom had little 
          or no knowledge should not be banned for the actions of 3 people. 2 
          cybercafes in denmark should not be blocked because of the actions of 
          3 people; the owners of those cafes should not be forced to go out of 
          business because of these actions. OSI is heartless and stupid,their 
          methods of dealing with this are incredibly moronic, so stupid that 
          you can't help but laugh. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And secondly, we really just 
          dont care. Yes, believe me, you are spending more time reading about 
          our actions and consequences than we are. Yes, you are posting more 
          messages about it on the boards than us, and yes, you are spending entirely 
          too much time on the subject(directed to everyone). People like me basicly 
          have it the worst off out of everyone, since we havent done anything 
          yet are recieving punishments as if we had. Common sense will tell you 
          that if someone hasn't commited a crime, didnt help someone commit a 
          crime, didnt knowingly (keyword) accept and use the items recieved from 
          a crime, and didnt know a crime was being commited, they shouldnt be 
          liable for a crime. Me and quite a few others are innocent, the actual 
          dupers arent speaking, and youre looking for someone to blame, someone 
          to attack with your misguided anger. Well, It isnt me. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A lot of good points, and probably 
        the first word from SUN that doesn't make me laugh uncontrollably. I tend 
        to believe this guy when he said he had no idea what was up. Should he 
        be banned? *sigh* Probably. Even though he didn't dupe, he benefited directly 
        from it, as did everyone in his guild. Knowing or not, that is a bannable 
        offense. Sorry.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He does say one thing that 
        I have a problem with, and it's something that SUN and their allies have 
        been saying all along... &quot;everyone would do it if they could&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyone WOULDN'T do it. Not 
        everyone is a theif. Hell, there's even folks like me who didn't dupe 
        in Diablo, and duping in that game had far less impact on others than 
        in UO (and was far easier). Some folks are actually... I know it's hard 
        to believe... fundamentally honest.</font></p>

          not to... the problem here is that alot of innocents were also hit by 
          the ban... and what happened to the phrase innocent till proven guilty...? 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OSI has banned any account 
          that was playing of the Cybercafe called Mekka... and another Cybercafe 
          too... Problem doing this is... alot of people that havent even been 
          involved in anything illegal have been banned... 10-year old kids that 
          play on Sonoma and Great Lakes and other roleplayer shards are banned... 
          people that once visited the (in-)famous players of Mekka and BT-Cafe 
          and once played from there... have also lost access... This is OSI's 
          sense of justice... and trust me they cant ever prove who duped and 
          who didnt... we have all seen it done... but very few are guilty... 
          and OSI cant honestly think that we will backstab our RL friends...? 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What will they do then...?

          cause OSI bans everyone we talk to on IRC... and everyone we helped

          a ton of money...? Let me let u in on a secret... one of the reasons 
          that SUN/TeamDK/DeathJester players have allways been good... is that 
          we know the game inside out... we play alot... and we do our best to 
          excell at the game... unlike most of the roleplayers who are content 
          at speaking a funny language and generally not knowing if they can kill 
          a mongbat or not... On any shard moneymaking is easy... eventhough some 
          think they need to make a GM tailor to gain gold... Hey newbie... try 
          killing some monsters... like Air elementals... or Bloods... then u 
          can make 80k / hrs... And therefore u have a problem... </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can u be sure that we 
          duped...? If all SUNs members had been doing the Air Ele or Blood Ele

          all of us be the owners of 4 mio GP... therefore it aint hard to place 
          castles... </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I rest my case... and will

        DISSENTING OPINION</b></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's someone commenting on 
        the SUN incident from the other side. I suspect most of you will disagree 
        with some of his points:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Number one, in my mind its 
          Origins fault there is a dupe. Why you ask? Well because they are stupid 
          and they always kiddy corner thier code. For example, thier magic fix 
          for animals going wild upon transfer is "transfer" is now "friend" its 
          the same code cut and pasted. Notice they didnt even attempt to fix 
          it until there was a way to "exploit" it to gain animal taming quickly. 
          They cant even fix reactive armor without somthing else related to the 
          spell re-breaking. Number two, this dupe has been around on Siege since 
          it first came up. Many people knew about it, only the idiots exploited 
          it to the max and got busted. (prime example is to why Denmark is not 
          a world power) I guarentee for the 30 people who were banned there are 
          50 more with over three million gold in the bank and many other items, 
          I promise. Number three, there are so many bugs on SP its not even funny 
          (unless you use them, then its a crackup). You think this was the only 
          dupe? There are at least six more item specific dupes around (among 
          other big bugs), none of which rely on the method used to dupe generic 
          stackables. Wonder how he got 30k arrows without this particular dupe, 
          hmmmm, mabey there is a way to combine feathers and shafts without using 
          the feather or shafts and placing 1 arrow in your pack. Macro that over 
          a couple days and you have a GM archer. All of these "new" bugs on Siege 
          were around at one point or another on the other public shards, OSI 
          just never retrofitted the old code. In addition you may want to reccomend 
          they check into thier billing software, I havent paid for UO in eight 
          months. They have bugs EVERYWHERE!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In all video (and otherwise) 
          games there are the cheaters and the non-cheaters. I know most people 
          arent cheaters, thats only because theyve never been given the opertunity. 
          I dont know if you ever played Street Fighter 2 or games like that but 
          there were always where you could keep your opponent in the corner the 
          whole round and they couldnt do a thing about it. Eventually everyone 
          knew the method and it ruined the game. Then again it was fun while 
          it lasted. Kind of like the direction UO is going, this shard was supposed 
          to be a challange. The only challange it provides for a lot of people 
          is the challange of how to cheat the system. Insted of spending time 
          chooping wood or mining ore we spend hours figuring out exploits. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I guarentee that if the population 
          of siege knew about this dupe, and knew they wouldnt get banned for 
          it 97% would use it. This game will never be bugless, therfore there 
          will always be cheaters. The cheaters always win, for every one cheater 
          that gets banned there are 50 more who can still login. </font></p>
