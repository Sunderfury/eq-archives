This file can contain SSI calls, but you may have to edit npa_ktalk.pl and
ktalkpost.cgi to give the generated files a .shtml extension.

This file is pure HTML, except for certain "magic comments" which are
substituted with other values when a talkback page is being generated. 

IMPORTANT: They are shown here with the * character inside them. This is so that
kTalk does not process these examples. When actually using these, remove the *s.

<!-*-ktalk news-*->: The full news item that this talkback thread is about. This
is in your normal news style, as generated by DoNewsHTML in ndisplay.pl or what
you have set in Change Settings.

<!-*-ktalk newpost-*->: Where user posts will be inserted.

<!-*-ktalk postURL-*->: The URL to ktalkpost.cgi.

<!-*-ktalk postnum:0-*-> and <!-*-ktalk newsID-*->: Used internally. Don't edit
them.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Eboshi Gozen end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Thunderlips is right on about the taming.  If Vet is ROT, it would be the perfect skill to throw in.  Otherwise 50 mage/50 resist (or whatever) is the better way to go.<br><br>Additionally, unless you're a newbie tamer that's going going to beg the UTB in Seige for a Dragon, Wyrm, Imp or HELLKITTEN, you have better things to do than waste your time with animal lore.  Like cooking or camping or smithing.  Or whatever :P<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Both of these are easy to get in a few days.  50 Magery 50 Resist is much better. &quot;UDL does not have any kewldudes&quot;, UDL is widely known as the biggest congregation of assholes on the shard. A few of your guys are &quot;in character&quot;, but the majority has &quot;average asshole&quot; stamped on there forehead.<!--ktalk end_comment-->
