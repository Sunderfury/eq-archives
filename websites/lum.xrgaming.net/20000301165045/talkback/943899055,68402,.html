This is the template for your kTalk talkback pages.
Once you have customized your template, you should probably remove this comment.
This file can contain SSI calls, but you may have to edit npa_ktalk.pl and
ktalkpost.cgi to give the generated files a .shtml extension.

This file is pure HTML, except for certain "magic comments" which are
substituted with other values when a talkback page is being generated. 

IMPORTANT: They are shown here with the * character inside them. This is so that
kTalk does not process these examples. When actually using these, remove the *s.

<!-*-ktalk news-*->: The full news item that this talkback thread is about. This
is in your normal news style, as generated by DoNewsHTML in ndisplay.pl or what
you have set in Change Settings.

<!-*-ktalk newpost-*->: Where user posts will be inserted.

<!-*-ktalk postURL-*->: The URL to ktalkpost.cgi.

<!-*-ktalk postnum:0-*-> and <!-*-ktalk newsID-*->: Used internally. Don't edit
them.
