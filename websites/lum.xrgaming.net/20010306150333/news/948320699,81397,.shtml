Characterization. People who don't act like flaming idiots. Hell, just   a somewhat pleasant way to kill a few hours.</p><p>You know, all the stuff you imagined when you signed up for Ultima Online/Everquest/Asheron's   Call. Unfortunately, all these games have proven is that when you get upwards   of 2000 people on one server, it's a foregone conclusion that 1,999 of them   aren't playing the game you paid for. Be it noto-PKers in UO, kill stealing   powerlevellers in EQ or AI-abusing spawn point farmers in AC, a lot of people   Just Don't Get It - they don't understand why YOU are playing the game. </p><p>Well, the developers hear you. The next batch of ORPGs, spearheaded by <a href="http://www.uo2.com/" target="_blank">UO2</a>,   may well be the last time a few thousand people are thrown on a server and expected   to fend for themselves. We're seeing discussion begin on a number of new ideas   in ORPGs... among them recognition that community building is one of the main   attractions of this medium. You'd think this would be an obvious thing, but   game developers tend to be <a href="http://www.daikatana.com/" target="_blank">slow</a>. </p><p>ORPGs to date have addressed community building from the perspective of a sledgehammer   meeting an anvil. </p><p>UO is the anvil. All the anvil does is sit there and take the blows. UO originally   expected community to arise, phoenix-like, from the ashes of the corpses lining   the streets of Trinsic, with no attempt at in-game programming support. Support   for guildstones was quickly added, however, and the most rewarding moments in   UO often occur in the context of guild interactions, whether between guild members   cooperating to meet an objective or conflict between two or more guilds. </p><p>EQ by contrast is the sledgehammer. Everquest was designed to be played by   groups of 3 to 6 players at a time. You can try to play EQ by yourself, but   the experience is painful and tedious at best. The game really is built around   this one concept - a team of six, with interlocking dependencies and strengths.   A cleric can heal exceptionally well but has little offensive capability. A   warrior can take brutal punishment but is totally helpless if the target decides   to, say, leave. A wizard can kill creatures merely by looking at them sternly,   but woe betide her if that creature survives long enough to hit back. If you   work with the sledgehammer - the intent of the designers - you can find a fairly   decent gaming experience. If you work against the sledgehammer, well, it feels   about as if a sledgehammer hit you. Larger-scale player interactions don't really   work in Everquest. Not only is the 3D engine not well suited to 30 people talking   to one another, but there really is no function for a large-scale guild in EQ   save the coordination of forming those smaller, 6-person groups. You will play   the game the way it is decreed or you will suffer.</p><p>AC is too young to really make honest judgements in its community building.   Call it the air between the sledgehammer and the anvil? Naw, let's just walk   slowly away from that metaphor and not look back. The allegiance/fealty system   is interesting in theory, but so far in practice it mainly consists of a total   stranger walking up to you and offering you phat l3wt if you promise to give   him your XP. It will be interesting, however, to see if a larger guild can really   make the allegiance system work, especially in a roleplayed environment. I expect   this will take place on Darktide (the PK server) first as the artificial constraints   of PvP switches tend to hinter the ability to deal with idiots without outside   intervention. <a href="http://azile.tradespot.net/" target="_blank">Azile</a>   is weaving a fairly interesting tale of shifting allegiances on her site, although   I'm kind of lost as to how she can make ruthless fun of Alice-te Katrina one   day and ally with her the next. Then again, I've been nice to <a href="http://www.happypuppy.com/features/bth/bth-vol8-46.html" target="_blank">Durga</a>   lately, too.</p><p>With the possible exception of AC, community building is really an afterthought   for all of these games. The expectation with UO was that the sheer critical   mass of thousands of people online at once would just spontaneously generate   community. Maybe it got PKed. EQ is a good example of the other side of the   equation. Community building is almost impossible in EQ simply because you rarely   play with the same people in any given gaming session due to the heavily forced   nature of grouping with those of identical needed skills. I'm told that once   lvl 50 (the top tier of advancement) is reached this changes, and uberguilds   form at that point. Maybe in three years or so I can tell you about that first   hand. </p><p>But what if a game was actually built on the thought that the fun of the game   is in interacting with a given group of friends on a somewhat long-term, persistent   basis -- I know, it's crazy, but it <b>just might work.</b></p><p>Let's discuss three of the new games hoping to prove it - Shadowbane, Neverwinter   Nights, and "X". </p><p><b>SHADOWBANE - "THE WEAK SHALL PERISH!" </b></p><p><a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/">Shadowbane</a> is probably the closest   of these to release, and we may well see it around the same time as UO2 (late   2000), with a limited beta due to begin soon. It's made a few interesting assumptions.</p><p>Shadowbane has positioned itself as a Player vs Player game. While a risky   assumption when looking at Everquest and Asheron's Call's successes with a PvP   switch, bear in mind that games such as Quake and Unreal outsell both of those   by a wide margin. Lots of people do want to kill each other (virtually, we hope).   The problem here is that those same PvPers tend to attract a fairly large subset   of ...assholes. You see, unlike Quake or Unreal where equality lays just past   the next respawn, it is possible to be a bully in ORPG PvP, and to spend your   entire online career preying on those far weaker than yourself. In fact, that's   really the most efficient method of advancement, especially in UO. Like Willie   Sutton said, you go where the money is, and human beings do a better job of   collecting it then &quot;a troll&quot; or &quot;a_froglok_shin_lord&quot;. Thanks   to developers buffing up monsters to be a challenge, humans, tend to be quite   a bit easier to kill, as well. Bullies, in case you missed the experience in   grade school, tend to be assholes. Generally, you do not want to spend money   to be around assholes. In fact, a lot of us spent a great deal of money to avoid   assholes. Especially in grade school.</p><p>Shadowbane's developers seem to be going after said assholes with great gusto,   based on their marketing thus far - &quot;I don't play games to bake bread,   I play them to crush!&quot; &quot;The strong will do well, and the weak will   perish!&quot; Think what would happen if you put Conan in charge of <b>your   </b>advertising. </p><p>Luckily, there seems to be a bit more to Shadowbane than testosterone poisoning.   Judging from what information has been released, the game is built around a   <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/warfare.html" target="_blank">meta-guild   system</a>. Players join a guild, which can be run by their friends or by the   game masters themselves, and those guilds themselves band together in nation-states,   which, as nations tend to do, invade each other for the purpose of rape, pillage,   and proving the superiority of their economic system.</p><p>Ultima Online's developers have made noises of implementing a similar meta-guild   system called &quot;factions&quot;, but Shadowbane's system, if it can be successfully   implemented, will provide a unique experience - think of an ORPG less as a monster-harvesting   festival but as a wargame - a contest both of strategy and tactics, with each   part from the Overlord to Spearchucker #12 filled by a human being. </p><p>If it works, it'll be great fun. If it doesn't work, it will make Ultima Online's   darkest days look like a paradise of sharing and caring. Place your bets. </p><p><a href="http://sb.drtwister.com/" target="_blank">Dr. TwisTer's Shadowbane   site</a> has done a stellar job on keeping an eye on Shadowbane's development.   Check the FAQ sections in particular for a large compendium of what the Shadowbane   dev team has had to say on the game's design so far (which has been quite a   bit).</p><p><b>NEVERWINTER NIGHTS - &quot;I ROLL A D20. DO I MAKE MY SAVE?&quot;</b></p><p><a href="http://www.neverwinternights.com/" target="_blank">Neverwinter Nights</a>,   due in 2001, will change the ORPG landscape. Other games will suddenly wonder   where all their players went. It looks that promising. </p><p>NWN (not the first game to bear that title, interestingly enough - <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Computer_Games/Titles/Role_Playing/Neverwinter_Nights/" target="_blank">Neverwinter   Nights on AOL</a> can make a good stab at claiming the title of first mass market   ORPG) is an AD&amp;D simulator. As described, it consists of two parts - the   Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide. </p><p>The Player's Handbook - the game client - is similar in form if not function   to the Bioware engine used to power Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment. While   using 3D rendering instead of the 2D sprites of the earlier titles, it promises   to be as faithful to the AD&amp;D rules set. </p><p>The Dungeon Master's Guide is where things get interesting. Bioware is promising   to include a complete authoring system for NWN. You can design your own &quot;modules&quot;,   and act as game master to a group of adventurers. A 56k modem might host 6,   a cable modem might host 64.</p><p>This model presents all sorts of interesting possibilites, and Bioware looks   set to act on them. Among the promised features - portals between servers, which   opens up the potential for linked worlds hosted by a co-operative of game masters.   A &quot;Character Vault&quot; similar to what is promised for Diablo 2, to prevent   character hacking by keeping character data server-side. </p><p>Wanted to be a seer in UO? This goes further. Imagine not only designing your   world and your storyline, but controlling key monsters within it - when the   players talk to them, they talk to you. Similar to some events we've seen in   UO already, but given the lower player-GM ratio in NWN you stand a far better   chance of affecting the story. In fact, in NWN you <b>are</b> the story; it   restores the &quot;single player&quot; paradigm of the players being the center   of their own particular universe.</p><p>NWN is still quite far from completion, of course, and it's always risky basing   evaluations on such early specifications. Still, this is one game to keep an   eye on.</p><p><b>&quot;X&quot; - RICHARD GARRIOTT'S APOLOGY</b></p><p>Lord British has been batting about .002 for pretty much the past ten years   now, so you can bet that when he talks about his new project, it's with a certain   air of &quot;god damn it, <i>this </i>time we're doing it right&quot;. The funny   thing is, he might well be.</p><p>We can thank Ultima 9 for what information we know about X - in the wake of   that disaster, Garriott hit the interview subject really, really anxious to   change the subject, so he was positively verbose about what he's currently working   on.</p><p>&quot;X&quot; - purposely not Ultima X, and one can't blame him for wanting   to get away from Sosaria after spending pretty much his entire adult life there   - is, as described in purposefully vague detail, a massively-multiplayer game   with components of the single-player experience. In other words, like Neverwinter   Nights. <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/022/193/garriott_interview3.html" target="_blank">In   Garriott's words</a>:</p><p><font color="#77FF77">So with X, I've put these two types of games [single   player and massively multiplayer] together. For example, you start the game   in what I call a homestead&#8212;a place to build your house, hang the head of the   dragon you just killed, or meet up with friends and trade. When you want an   adventure, instead of doing it like Ultima Online, where a thousand people are   ahead of you and a thousand people are behind you waiting to do the same adventure,   imagine that the adventures are individual Ultima games with multiple people.   You go on these adventures that are custom-crafted from anywhere from solo player   to massively multiplayer and everything between. The adventures could be like   Quake Arena, where it's every man for himself. Or they could literally be solo-player   Ultima IV, where you go on that adventure alone.</font></p><p>Sounds good so far. Then you get quotes that make you   think Lord British's crown is on a bit too tightly. From <a href="http://www.well-rounded.com/games/reviews/garriott_intv_1.html" target="_blank">another   interview</a>:</p><p><font color="#77FF77">Garriott says he hopes to break new ground with X, taking   gaming to an area that, at first blush, sounds nearly impossible. "I want to   create a game that does not reward devotion," he says. In other words, time   invested in X won't necessarily equal advancement. Right now, in order to bring   virtually any gaming character to a level where you want to be (high level,   advanced spells, BFGs, etc.) you have to invest dozens and dozens of hours of   gameplay. It's something hard core gamers have come to expect, but it tends   to alienate casual gamers, a much bigger audience. Garriott says he hopes to   replace that required time investment with something else, though exactly how   he's planning to do it is something he's keeping close to his vest right now.   "Think of your best friend," he explains. "Your best friend is not your best   friend because he spends the most time with you." </font></p><p>And later:</p><p><font color="#77FF77">"I want to put the ability to put real money in a virtual   world," he says, with a proud smile on his face. </font></p><p>Put those two together and it's a pretty ugly picture.   At any rate, it's doubtful we'll see anything concrete about X in the next couple   of years. Still, it's interesting that apparently Origin is also aiming for   the ad-hoc group adventure model.</p><p>At any rate, UO2 should be the last of the &quot;throw enough players at the   screen and see what sticks&quot; model of game design. (And hell, considering   that we know absolutely nothing about UO2 save that it will probably look a   whole lot like EQ, it's hard to say what design decisions they're working under   anyway.) Which is as it should be - as the ORPG industry matures and more options   become available, one might actually be able to comparison shop gaming environments   and choose the one that suits their fancy, instead of choosing at random from   two or three that try to be all things to all people.</p><p><font color="#000000"><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000012.html">Got   something to say about this story?
