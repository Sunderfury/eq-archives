          <p><font face="Arial">No, the web site isn't closing down. Hell, we

          got to spread the word to leave Gary Coleman alone, if nothing else. I

          just plan on ranting about EQ more than UO, since I play EQ more than

          UO. (By the way, I just want to say that Rallos Zek is a completely

          different server if you're a Drow. Unlike the other races, they

          actually stick together as intended. Some lamer tried to PK my 1st

          level newbie and 12 different people bitchslapped him down to size.

          Feel the fury of the Teir'Dal!)</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Will I ever play UO again? Probably. One thing

          about UO, come back in 4 months and it's a completely different game.

          Maybe everyone will be using axes or something.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Here's a response I've gotten already. I'd say

          if even HALF of his list was implemented, I'd be back in UO in a

          heartbeat. Especially Item 1. GOD, especially Item 1.</font></p>



          

          <div><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>The new &quot;patch&quot; has brought me into some serious consideration 

of just flat out quitting UO as well.&nbsp; First, here are some 

thing I would like to see and would make me want to play again.</i> </font></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Shard Wipe, all of them (in the voice of

  Palpatine).</font></i></div>

<div><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>1 house per account, period.</i></font></div>

<div><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>You can only res 1 time per day per karma level, period

  (neg 

karma would need several days).</i></font></div>

<div><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Make a non-pk shard.</font></i></div>

<div><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Make a pk free-for-all shard 

(well, abyss..)</i></font></div>

<div><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Have skills change on a generic scale that is time based, not 

&quot;use skill, repeate 7000 times&quot;.</i></font></div>

<div><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Fire all the GMs under 23 (all of them) and hire 

professionals</i></font></div>

<div><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Hire 5 PhD programmers, tell them you want 

results in 30 days or they are all fired</font></i></div>

<div><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Hire 30 support staff from 

Cisco </i> </font>

  <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Thats not too much to ask for is it?</i> </font></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Now let me make the generic &quot;I'm pist because...&quot; 

list</font></i></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>

<div><i><font size="2" face="Arial">- They lied to us: Frankly, this is the thing 

that urks me the most. 2 weeks before EQ came out we were given a sniff of many 

nifty new UO things to toy with. The Alchemy patch, Good/Evil patch, and 

Necromancy. They bluntly lied and tonld us they would be out in a few weeks. EQ 

came and past, UO still remained with no real changes. Instead we get a 

provocation &quot;fix&quot; (the hoards of game breaking bards are breaking the game I 

guess), tinkering &quot;fix&quot; (you may know about that), and rebroke fishing again. 

They also lied about houses being placed on the new lands, paying for new 

add-ons, and many other issues. </font></i></div>

<div><i><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>- The Client: Man oh man. How they ~still~ 

fuck up the same program after 2 years? Christ! It won't even save uo.cfg and my 

hard drive thrashes on 512 meg of ram when Uo is running. This is just flat out 

incompetence.</font></i></div></div>

<div><font face="Arial"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></div>

<div><i><font size="2" face="Arial">- Annoyances: Thing that should have been fixed 

by now but are not. How many times have you had a vendor teleport out on you 

while you had the shopping list open?&nbsp; Ever try to buy Pearl at peak hours? 

Don't you love having doors slamming in your face? etc...<br></font></i></div>

<div><font face="Arial"><i>&nbsp;</i></font><i><font size="2" face="Arial">- Housing: I don't know where to even start on 

this one.&nbsp; I hate hear someone whine how they can't place the Tower deed they 

bought with the 5 million gold they duped last year. I ~barely~ got enough for a 

small house and I can't place the damn thing...</font></i></div>

<div><font face="Arial"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></div>

<div><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>You know what, fuck you OSI and fuck me for putting up with 

the shit. Damn it, I just want to play the game and have some fun.</i></font></div>

          MON AMOUR </b> </font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Time to call it a day.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">I think the final straw for me was going on my

          non-macroed, non-powergaming like-you're-supposed-to daily mining run

          and finding out I couldn't build shovels any more.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Shovels. They're pretty simple, really. You take

          a slab of flat metal, nail it to a stick of wood, and wallah, you have

          a shovel. Hell, I could probably do it in real life and I have a

          Tinkering skill of maybe 0.8.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">My miner, however, who has a Tinkering of 40 or

          so, can't. I'm sure all the macrominers who have GM Tinkering along

          with everything else aren't fazed, but for me, it's pretty pissy.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Actually it's symptomatic of something else,

          really... the divide between Newbie and Powergamer, those who think

          generating 10K a day in wealth is no big deal and think UO is too

          easy, and those who consistently get the beatdown from rabbits. (Well,

          they're large fierce rabbits.) Those powergamers were able to get GM

          Smiths and GM Resist and all those other now impossible to gain

          skills, and really don't give a flying hoohah that those skills are

          now impossible to gain for anyone else, and that this pretty much

          locks the game down to those who are already in, playing.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">So, you can mine the way you're

          &quot;supposed&quot; to, running 250 or 260 stone (because you know,

          having 100 STR is impossible without macroing) of ore back and forth,

          and after a few hours maybe having 500 ore. Woo hoo!</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Or you can macromine off a boat. And get banned.

          And figure out the next way to powermine. Hell, I don't know,

          levitation?</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">The macroing thing bothered me too. It always

          bothered me. The response, more from the children who dominate this

          game then anything else, is &quot;well, if you don't have the time to

          devote to this game, you shouldn't be able to do what you want.&quot; </font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">An exact quote from a player:</font></p>



          

          <div><i><font face="Arial">A good majority of the UO populous has no clue what's best for it... I 

don't</font></i></div>

<div><i><font face="Arial">care if 80% of the votes say &quot;yes, we want this&quot;... if it's a bad idea, 

then</font></i></div>

<div><i><font face="Arial">it shouldn't be put in...</font></i></div><p><font face="Arial">Pretty

          much says it all for me. Ya know, doesn't matter what people want,

          because they don't know what's best for them. Bleah. Sorry, I work for

          a living, I don't have time to be re-educated into the proper way of

          thinking. </font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">About the only thing that could have saved UO at

          this point for me would have been a compelling plot line. OK, you can

          stop laughing now. Seriously, UO has the capability for decent

          roleplaying, but OSI's support for this ingame has wavered between

          non-existent, sort of halfassed, and &quot;Fuck you, we're too busy

          looking for macroers&quot;. Three guesses what the current stance is.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Too bad, because Pandemonium's new client is

          pretty cool. A game behind it would have been nice, though.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Bottom line: it's just not fun any more. So I'm

          going on a vacation. Not cancelling the account (hell, I'll sell it on

          eBay before I do that, I like own houses on Great Lakes and shit), but

          taking a break.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Since I'm not going to be frustrated in UO any

          more for a while, I guess I'll be frustrated in EQ. Look for me on the

          Veeshan (Sturmrider the lost barbarian) and Rallos Zek (Ylumdal the

          scheming Drow necromancer) servers.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">What about the web site? Haven't decided yet.

          I'm open to letting someone who still plays UO rant on about it while

          I figure out if anything in EQ is worth ranting about. They introduced

          a totally fucked up patch the other night, so there is hope.</font></p>

            I'll put something else in this space. Like more information on

          PAULA! She's the psychic babe. Who sings. My step-daughter works as a

          child care worker in a fitness center and saw Paula bring her kids in

          while she worked out. It was a long way to drive (Cabot, where she was

          staying, is about 30 miles from where we live). I think she probably

          brought her kids there so that she could get some privacy and not have

          details of her every waking moment posted on the Internet or

          something. PAULA! You should buy all her records several times. I went

          to elementary school with a girl named Paulette. I don't think it was

          Paula though because, you know, the name was like different and stuff.

          Plus it was in Florida. Paulette was sweet though. I wonder what

          happened to her. Maybe she has a psychic hotline of her own, too.

          PAULA!</font></p>
