As always, comment, etc. I'll have a poll up once the server foolishness settles down so you can make your opinion on the future direction of this site known in a slightly more scientific fashion.<br><br>---<br><br>In regards to your current use of the volunteer program as target practice, you are generalizing a system that is based on charity. The people that wear the robes are contributing their time and effort, with very little compensation, to providing a service for those who wish to use it.<br><br>For you to so callously and carelessly take a few instances and use them to tear down the entire program is all at once sickening and malicious. The majority of those involved with the Counselor and Seer programs do it out of the goodness of their heart, in an attempt to make the game you play a little bit better. You can use any amount of propaganda and circumstance to conjure the impression that everyone involved is either power-hungry or elitist, but when it comes down to it, they receive nothing but flak from you and your counterparts, and saving ten dollars a month is small compensation for the general disrespect the term "volunteer" now carries.<br><br>In fact, if you really were so concerned about the current state of affairs, you'd take it upon yourself to apply for a position. If you have such an insight as to how the organization should be run, and the<br>methods a volunteer should use, then securing a place among their ranks and leading by example is much more productive than standing off on your pedestal and preaching from the safety of ignorance.<br><br>Not to mention many of the volunteers you have so often slandered have done far more for the community than you pretend. In fact, I would invite you to do a little background work on a few of your "victims", and discover that other than one or two indiscretions,<br>they did exemplary work and contributed much to the world of Britannia, both past and present.<br><br>Prejudice against an entire group based on the actions of a few is at once both narrow and shallow. Unless you want to become Ultima's version of Archie Bunker, I would suggest taking a second look at the situation, and re-evaluating your stance.<br><br>Or ride a bike. God knows you need to.<br><br>-Kieran Darkmire, Reporter for the Atlantic Times<br><br>===<br><br>Leaving aside for the moment the hysterical images a 350lb Lum paddling down the street conjures, let's look at the rest of this message.<br><br>So the counselors are poor, misunderstood volunteers, giving up their time and effort for little more than altruism. Uh huh.<br><br>Well, in the real world, the one I happend to live in, there is no such thing as altruism.<br><br>What, you say? But Lum, *I'm* a counselor, and the *only* reason I do it is to help people! You suck! Go on a diet!<br><br>By "there's no such thing as altruism", I mean that there is always a motive, no matter how pure it may be. Given the ideal circumstance, that someone sincerely likes to help people, and sees this as an opportunity to do so, they are not doing this out of a divine sort of altruism. They do it because helping people makes them feel better. This isn't bad - it's human nature.<br><br>Given human nature, I suspect there are a few folks involved with the program that have somewhat baser motivations. Such as being part of the "in crowd", being "elite", being higher in the "chain of command" than the average player, being part of the "inside", having "access."<br><br>Whether you choose to admit it or not, these are quite valid reasons. And ones that, from any objective viewpoint, have been quite prevalent in the OSI Volunteer Program.<br><br>Why is this a problem? Refer back to my recent postings. Yes, they were pretty damned tawdry. However, as a certain Special Prosecutor might say in a similar circumstance, while unsavory, this was necessary to establish motive. For the crime involved isn't that of GMs sleeping with SRCs - other than in a prurient Jerry Springer sort of way, no one really cares who's zooming who, and it's all totally unable to be proven if they did - but that of GMs then turning around and giving special favors to those SRCs and others, such as deleting property placed by players for their friends, introducing one-hit-killer weapons into the game for their friends, and other game-corrupting events.<br><br>Refer back to the Montes Darkwisp story I posted from Everquest. There the stakes are higher. How much do you think a Butcherblock Hammer, the best weapon currently in the game, would sell for on e-Bay? How do you feel, knowing that, knowing that certain guilds tried to influence who would get that hammer, using their influence in the EQ Guide program?<br><br>This isn't about sex, it isn't about who's in what IRC channel. It is about the corruption of a virtual community. And that should concern you, even if who's sleeping with who shouldn't. Because while UO is only a game, it is also a community of people, which by dint of reading this you happen to belong to. And while corruption may be a fact of life in "real life", this does not mean that this is something that must be tolerated in the virtual world.<br><br>I have gotten a large number of emailed and ICQed personal attacks in the past few days - the one posted above is quite mild compared to others. And all that tells me is that I'm on the right track. Poke the anthill, and watch what scurries out into the light.<br><br>This isn't the first time this has happened. There is a rich history in the MUD world of this sort of tawdry corruption involved when volunteers operate the support system. And the BBS scene before that was much the same. I'm working on researching examples of this. If you have any, send them to me (send them to lum@webtoys.net if my xrgaming.net address bounces).<br><br>I never said that every single individual counselor was corrupt.<br><br>I said the <b>system</b> is corrupt. And it is.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name SoonToBeFormerUOPlayer end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Orb-People taking advantage of a system does not make the system itself corrupt, it may mean that the system is in need of help, but to blame the whole for the actions of a few is rediculous in the extreme.  <br>Counsellors helping loot towers? They can't even get in the fucking things.  Right now if you respond to a call in a house you get ejected to the outside, you can't walk through the doors, nothing.  This is a bullshit leftover story from the early days of the volunteer program.  No counsellor has helped do this is a LONG time because it is impossible.<br><br>Sandstone-All I'm saying is that Lum should be consistent here, if he's going to discount one part of the story because it can't be proven, why should he not discount the whole thing if it can't be proven?  And as to people coming forward, who cares?  Most people that left the program were bitter about leaving in the first place and many of them were catty little shits to begin with and are always eager to point fingers.  I could easily write you up a bullshit complaint and fill it up with times and names, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't be full of shit either.  Do you really believe that all this shit was going on?  GMs screwing Counsellors?  Jesus, most of the arrogant little fuckers wouldn't stoop so low as to talk to an unpaid volunteer.  Damn, most of the assholes don't even take calls on their shifts, they're off doing other things or jacking off in the bathroom.  Any counsellor can tell you that you'll easily wait an hour or more for a GM with a .helpme call.<br><br>I just think that Lum has no right to judge a program that he has no real knowledge of how it works.  If he *really* knew anything that was going on with the program he wouldn't have posted this bullshit in the first place.  Well, I guess the number of posts he'd been making was down and I'm sure the number of hits he was getting was down too, and what gets him the most hits? stomping on Gms and counsellors. Oh well..<br><br>Besides, it's easy to make suggestions from the outside.  Try doing it once.  Just once.  You'll see how different it is.  Try spending 6 hours a week and only getting about 3-4 intelligent questions.  Read the Cops parody, its right on.  You'll get at least 4 or 5 calls on a normal day of some idiot trying to place a house in a spot where it clearly will not fit and who will then proceed to tell you why you should place it for him because it's not fair because he doesn't have a house.  As if you programmed the game and even could place it..  The thing everyone forgets.. There may be a great deal of intelligent (at least semi-intelligent, you have to downgrade it thanks to the CoB DevBoard) conversation about UO going on, but the majority of people that play are complete morons and can't even count tiles or figure out how to use a skill as easy as hiding. <br><br>And why does no one give out their names?  Either: 1.  They're full of shit or 2.  They still play and would like to keep their account.  <br><br><br><br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

I'd be more impressed and less disbeliving of these anonymous posts and letters to Lum if the people, espicaly the ex such and such people, would have the courage to at least give their counselor/ex counselor or gm/ex gm or whatever else they are  name.  I don't quite understand why you are being anoymous.  Counselor X, what do you have to fear if you give out your name.  Everyone else who is saying all of these things and not giving any name, why?

If smurfs had penises, mine would definately scwhing for you. That aside, I think the criticism contained is RIGHT ON THE MONEY. I've posted on your boards and even emailed you in the past few months, and you know I'm right with you on 95% of the issues, however - you *are* assessing the volunteer program based upon the few who abused it.<br>Welfare is a *FANTASTIC* program to help people *EAT FOOD* and *NOT FREEZE TO DEATH* in the cold winter, however; many people think that for the sake of those who abuse the welfare program, the whole system should be destroyed.<br><br>You don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, Lum.<br>You're better than this - focus your talent and energy towards a *real* solution.<br>Removin the volunteer program is *NOT* a real solution. Give yourself 5 minutes to ponder it, and you'll realize where you are wrong.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

No motive here that I can think of offhand.<br>I played the game for a long time, and learned a lot about the game and the mechanics of it.<br><br>Then I started getting bored...there's only so much you can do in UO, and I did most of it.  So, I applied for a spiffy blue robe.  I was accepted.<br><br>Now, I still get to interact with others, but it's all a roll of the dice WHO I actually talk to.  One call may be a well-spoken older person, the next an angry 'd3wd'.  The whole point of it is, I had no ulterior motives going into the counseling field (aside from boredom), but smurfing certainly spiced it up.<br><br>So if looking for something new constitutes a 'motive', I guess I'm guilty.<br>At least I'm helping others while I'm getting my jollies  :P.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

And yes, usually that motive is the fact that counselors get to have some sort of power.<br>This isn't to say that they aren't perfectly nice and helpful to you in game, but there is a motive. Now, I don't believe any of the stuff about the GMs<br>sleeping with SRCs, they make it sound like every person in the program was railing each other. But, I do believe that GMs gave favors to SRCs and other<br>people, that isn't too far stretched. Wouldn't you too, if you had the power, and were friends with someone?<br>Don't lie, you know you would.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

How would you go about gathering it? If an Ex-GM came out and said he did so and so you would most likely chalk it up to him being bitter and making it all up. Would you like Orgin to confirm this for you? LOL. What we have are scores of people in the system coming forward saying how corrupt the system was. All of them bring with them certain undeniable facts, names, dates, times, events. That, for me, is at least good enough to show on the whole corruption is amongst these people. It doesn't matter if one story is true or not, that isn't even an issue. You have to look at the whole thing to get what is going on.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

To me that is corrupt. Not that I care, as long as my account is fine, and none of my shit is touched, they can do whatever the hell they want. Anyway I think that the guy is right, there are counsellors out there who work thier asses off just to help players out, and to them goes my thanks(and my sympathy), but the counsellors who can't even spell &quot;counsellor&quot;(Did I spell it wrong? I'm a little slow right now), and the little shits who help thier friends loot towers give the whole damned thing a REALLY bad name. But, as I said, I don't care, as long as they are smart enough to answer my questions its all good. (to the little shit who looted my friends tower, I know where you live, bitch. Don't be surprised when I come knocking. You know who you are, don't lie). By the way Lum, your getting to be quite the &quot;l33t&quot; journalist. Doing a good job you are.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name SoonToBeFormerUOPlayer end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Lum, I'm usually right there agreeing with you, but this time I have a few points to make.. First, you say you don't care about what GMs fucked what Counsellors and say that it can't be proven, but then bitch about Gms giving away special favors in the way of one hit weapons and deleting houses to place new ones. How about proof on this? And I'm not talking about some anonymous piece of shit who mails you telling you &quot;yeah, me too!&quot;.  I was a Counselor for a long time.  I did it because I liked it and liked the UO community and felt it was my way to give back to that community.  Yes, there were people in the program (and more than just a few) who liked it because of they thought it made them elite, but to tell you the truth most of the GMs in my time in the program didn't give a flying fuck about the Counsellors and most of the littlle pukes wouldn't even take the time to talk to the Counsellors, even when they needed help.. Which, incidentally, was the reason I quit the program.. I felt that if we were supposed to do a certain job then they should give us the tools and help to do that job.  The system may not be great, but it's all there is right now.  A few people taking advantage of the system does *not* make the system corrupt.  If that were true than just about any institution you can think of could be called corrupt.<br>And I can't believe that just because people are mad at you that you are right.  That's a moronic assumption on your part and you don't usually make assumptions that stupid, so try again..<br>Oh well, AC ships Tuesday and my time in UO has come to a close and likely my visits to this site have ended.<br><br><!--ktalk end_comment-->
