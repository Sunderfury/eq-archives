</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are you a PK? Well, the good news 
    - no stat loss for murderers, ever. Also, you can be finally be a Dread Lord 
    red instead of &quot;The Murderer&quot; as that is going away. The bad news 
    - well, with one character slot per player you had better either be one hard 
    core PK or have friends. Actually with the other changes, solo PKs are going 
    to be almost impossible to play. Like everyone else, you will <i>need</i> 
    some kind of support system.<br>
    <br>
    Other details of interest to PKs -- you can only res via the Chaos Shrine 
    or some red healers that will be sprinkled around the land. (They're not invulnerable, 
    but like all other human NPCs they will now give murder counts when killed.) 
    Other players, too, but it's going to be a while before anyone FINDS the Res 
    spell, much less has it ready for the casting. The only town you can go to 
    as a red, as before, is Buc's Den, and the gate from Vesper has been closed. 
    Better save for a boat. Speaking of towns, magic works in towns now, so don't 
    bother making those gimped up townfighters.<br>
    <br>
    Oh, and did I mention no recall? If you're going to play, you'd best be ready 
    to play.<br>
    <br>
    (Just in case you're interested, I along with my entire guild will probably 
    be going red once we get reasonably established. What can I say, challenge 
    is good.)<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are you a gimp who likes to stand 
    on a ledge and provoke balrons or EV them to death all day? Better find a 
    new shard -- provocation has been gimped and is now difficulty based, along 
    with the previous barding gimps. I don't think we'll see too many bards on 
    SP. Blade Spirit and Energy Vortex have also been gimped. Oh, and you can't 
    cast Gate in dungeons either, or mark there. Hmm. Dungeons are going to be 
    <i>fun</i> to hunt in now. Speaking as someone who likes to hunt the two legged 
    creatures therein.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everything costs 3x as much. Guilds, 
    guildstones, houses, boats, armor, spells, regs, dropping a gp on a beggar 
    to get them to shut up... everything costs 3x as much. And NPCs won't buy 
    a damn thing. So give up on that tailor mule. Oh, and give up on that fisherman 
    mule too, since you won't be able to fish up treasure maps or SOS (&quot;You'll 
    find an SOS once a week&quot;). No more seeing people yell &quot;I WILL TAKE 
    THEE&quot; trailed by 50 escorts either -- only one escort per customer. NPCs 
    don't carry money on them, so slaughtering them is useless (and it gives you 
    a murder count). <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tailoring still has one use - 
    leather armor. The skill requirement for making leather will be lowered, and 
    players will be able to wear leather without any penalty to Meditation or 
    Stealth. Plus, if you wear a leather cap, you will look very funky.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lots of skills won't unhide you 
    when you use them, such as Detect Hidden, Item Eval, Arms Lore, Snooping, 
    Poisoning, Eval Int and Anatomy. You may begin macroing on my mark.... GO.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thieves are somewhat less gimped 
    on SP. Although you still have to be in the Thieves Guild to steal from players 
    (and like everything else it costs 3X as much), you won't be booted from it 
    for taking a murder count, and the chance of being revealed while stealthing/snooping 
    has been significantly lowered. However random steal is gone... you have to 
    snoop first. NPCs will attack anyone who steals from them outside of town. 
    </font> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far so good. </font></p>
  </li>

    team in tonight's UoHOC chat.</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Shard will be up by midnight tonight, hopefully (Runesabre)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The initial skill difficulty curve on the shard will 
      be based on an existing shard. (Runesabre)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Factions will be temporarily disabled pending fiction 
      to be written for them. (Runesabre)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Good/Evil system WILL be on SP. (Pandemonium)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The shard will be a normally supported shard - GMs 
      will be assigned to it, as will seers and counselors pending resolution 
      of technical issues with the one-character-per-account logon (Runesabre)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Mark will be disabled within dungeons. Possibly gating 
      within dungeons will be disabled as well. (Runesabre, Sunsword)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">OSI is considering using current resources to put up 
      temporary &quot;diversion&quot; shards such as Abyss, but there are no current 
      plans to bring back Abyss. (Sunsword)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Vesper-Buc's gate will not appear on SP. (Runesabre)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The only way to get higher circle spells initially 
      will be to kill monsters that spawn with them. (Toad)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">There will be some red healers. However being red will 
      not be easy in general, and this is purposeful. (Runesabre)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Currently the only unguarded town will be Buccaneer's 
      Den. This may change in the future. (Toad)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Just in case you missed it (many in the chat apparently 
      did) everything available from vendors will be triple the usual cost. The 
      3x pricing will apply to housing and boats. (Sunsword) It will cost 1500 
      gp to join the Thieves' Guild. (Runesabre) Player vendors will be allowed, 
      although the vendor charges will be 3X that of normal vendors (Runesabre) 
      Buying skills, joining NPC guilds, hiring NPCs, and stabling animals will 
      all be triple cost. (Runesabre)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Changes to fishing: Fishing poles going to have wear 
      and tear, treasure maps will be removed, and SoS reduced drastically. Magic 
      fish are still in. (Sunsword) Finding an SoS bottle will be something you 
      can brag about and will be a rare occurrence. (Pandemonium)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Murderers will be billed 15x the usual cost for running 
      a vendor. (Runesabre, Toad)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The server maintenance down time will be 0500 CST (Runesabre, 
      Sage)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Chests that spawn in camps on the surface will be locked 
      and trapped with lethal force. (Toad)</font></li>

    TRIUMPHANT</font><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"></font></font></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some more thoughts on <b>the</b> 
    topic of the day.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EVERYONE I talk to is moving to 
    Siege Perilous. People are talking about selling established characters on 
    other shards, knowing that they are gonna be on SP full time. <i>BEFORE THE 
    SHARD IS EVEN UP. </i>In fact, I know quite a few folks who are re-activating 
    their accounts to start on this shard. Why is it so popular?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simple - no twinks.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This shard is going to be <b>hard 
    as hell </b> to get started on. Think about it folks - how are you going to 
    get money? How are you going to go bash on your first orc? With that practice 
    sword? I don't <b>think </b>so. So go buy a sword from the NPC vendors... 
    I dare you. What? It costs 190gp and you only started with 100gp? Gee. Guess 
    someone has a problem.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So basically, the only folks who 
    are going to be established here are the hardest of the hardcore. No more 
    macroing tailoring skullcaps. No more going to your buds who have castles 
    chock full of platemail for outfitting. Hell, no more castles - those deeds 
    cost a cool THREE MILLION GOLD. Guild membership is a <b>requirement</b>, 
    they may as well ask what guild you're in when you roll up a new character.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You going to be a merchant? Fine 
    (and they will <b>rule</b> this shard), but that's what you are... no mules, 
    unless you have a second or third account (and truthfully, not many of us 
    are that ate up, including myself). You going to be a mage or alchy? Fine, 
    but I hope you have a LOT of money saved up for reagents.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You going to be a PK? Heh heh heh. 
    Hope you can run when the tables turn, boy, because Mister Kal Ort Por is 
    out of business.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I predict the server will be <i>FLOODED 
    </i>the first couple of days -- then, as it sets in exactly how hard it will 
    be to get started, the total number of people on will drop tremendously. But 
    those who are left are going to have a riot.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a pretty shrewd move for 
    the UO dev team. UO's strengths over EQ lie in its cooperative/PvP environment 
    and in its economy. Siege Perilous is the undiluted-heroin version of both 
    of those. The economy will be 100% player driven... the ONLY way to make money 
    in bulk will be from other players, or 200gp at a time from monsters. That's 
    it, folks. Everything else is up to you. Player vendors will be HUGE. Selling 
    everything from equipment (and finally, non-exceptional equipment will have 
    a player market now) to reagents to the little things... like backpacks. You 
    really want to pay an NPC 250gp for a backpack? Didn't think so.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this server will be the PvP 
    equivalent of the major leagues. Simply put, if you think you're a badass 
    in UO, you are going to be on Siege Perilous. If you aren't on SP, you won't 
    be shit. Because you can't compete. And everyone will know it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Want to know why OSI put Siege 
    Perilous up? Simple... newbies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When all of us hardcore PK assassins 
    flock to SP like bees to honey, the production shards become a much safer, 
    friendlier place. It's a better environment for novices. It's always kind 
    of intimidating when you show up in Minoc as a newbie and there's 50 corpses 
    laying around from the latest townwar.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, it's a shrewd move by OSI,

    -</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - ONE CHARACTER PER SHARD! Buh-bye, 
    mules.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- No more advancement gates! Work 
    up your skills like everyone else, knob.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- No more stat loss on death for 
    murderers. It's a harsh world -- be careful out there.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- NPC prices have been jacked up 
    300% - and they don't buy anything!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Escorts no longer have gold (so 
    much for my &quot;revolutionary&quot; luring nobles to his house and killing 
    them for fun and profit)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Bard provocation is skill based 
    (didn't they already put this on the regular shards?) and instruments can 
    wear down after use.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Some traps will be nasty.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know this sounds like an OSI 
    press release but I'm pretty pumped about this, and so are a lot of other 
    veterans looking for an &quot;expert-level shard&quot; free from knobs and 
    twinks (well, maybe not so much free as with easily slain knobs and twinks). 
    Adrick from Battle Vortex, who quits UO almost as often as I do, is hosting 
    a new Siege Perilous forum... go <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com/">check 
    it out.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yes, I'll be there. I was waiting 
    for some of the new changes to come into play to return to UO, and a new PvP 
    shard definitely qualifies. Come get some, punk.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Oh, and I'm told </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the 
    skill gain curve has been set to be the same as the production shards already 
    in place. No Insta-GM Smiths for you!)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With more on the fine customer 
    service screenshot we reposted from Twisty's this morning, here's an unusual 
    opinion Maelstorme sent in on GM Boo. Note that this is the same GM that is 
    rumored to have wiped Nighthawk's keep after he was banned.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've had (As numerous others) 
      many bad run-ins with GM's, and I (As you do) deal with customer support 
      for a living in a computer related environment. I have personally on Sonoma 
      had many, many run-ins with GM Boo, and he/she is the ONLY GM I have had 
      any direct interaction with who not only solved every one of my problems 
      fast and with a smile, but also would appear so you could actually interact 
      with him/her. I agree that there shouldn't be any kind of condescending 
      manner directed towards your customers, but then again, I can also tell 
      that these players are none too bright from the grasp of proper English 
      grammar they seem to have ;) I would be inclined to think that there is 
      much more here than meets the eye and something fishy did happen. I'm also 
      a little curious as to why exactly 2 players who just had to hand over 80k 
      they felt they were entitled to, decided to putter off into what looks like 
      a dungeon when they placed a call to a counselor.....Hmmmm.... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This of course is my opinion, 
      but then I think GM Boo is one of the better GM's out there from my personal 
      experience. Here's a possible scenario: Players manage to net 80k from a 
      player using some possible grey area between an exploit and being plain 
      out dishonest. Player loosing 80k pages GM, GM verifies foul play, jails 
      the alleged criminals, who then return the money to said player. Exploit/cheat 
      players feel more than a little anger, page a counselor who they tell their 
      side, and who in turn calls the GM in. Argument ensues where the players 
      running their scam are not willing to listen to the GM's side at all before 
      trying to explain their side (remember as a GM the clocks always ticking, 
      and with somtimes 1 GM per 2 shards according to Darwin, time is of essence 
      as calls back up in the queue.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I dunno Lum....I'm undecided 
      on this one, but feel that good service should be encouraged, and I have 
      had no complaints about Boo (Other GM's, yes) and I would want a little 
      more insight into this one, like maybe the journal log file from one of 
      the jailed "victims."</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My opinion? I don't care if the 
    idiots in question were filling the air with badly spelled obscenity. The 
    attitude shown was wrong. Not only wrong, but symptomatic of a deeper rot. 
    The GM pictured was in the middle of the same sort of speech I'd give my 12 
    year old. Hey, guess what -- we're not 12 year old children. We are customers. 
    We pay for this. Conduct of that sort from people whose salary we pay for 
    is unacceptable. Completely. No excuse. No mitigating factors.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's another interesting post 
    from Raph Koster on rec.games.computer.ultima.online, in response to a plea 
    from a poster for some sort of virtue/Virtues in UO. (Hey, am I a cheat-oriented 
    site too?)</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jim, Let me start 
      by saying that I completely understand where you are coming from, and admire 
      your dedication to the virtues. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think that 
      the Virtues serve as a powerful lesson, but only in reaction to evil. In 
      other words, all the standalone Ultimas started out with a world in turmoil 
      and succumbing to evil. It was the task of the player to set it right, and 
      it (presumably) stayed right until the next game. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In your post 
      I sense a tension between a desire to be the one who enters a land gone 
      evil and sets it right, and a desire to run around in a land where things 
      ARE right. But in a land where everything already embodies the Virtues, 
      when do you actually exercise them? When do you actually face ethical challenges? 
      There are no beggars to be compassionate towards. There are no misleadingly 
      smooth promises by a Fellowship. There are no tensions and misunderstandings 
      between two races. Because everyone is already on the right path. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To make a successful 
      game, we can't make it completely peaceful. People do crave some extent 
      of that struggle, I think. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That said, I 
      know that not everyone wants to log into the game to struggle against the 
      forces of evil. And a lot of them want to BE the forces of evil. The thing 
      is, UO is no longer teaching the lesson you have learned. It is instead 
      asking you the player to put it into practice in your dealings with other 
      players. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is amply evident 
      that a sizable number of the players of UO don't, can't, or won't. I'd welcome 
      ideas on how to get them to--but I don't think the answer lies is either 
      getting rid of those who are ethically challenged (that in itself is unethical 
      IMHO--you have to teach them the right way to behave) nor in preventing 
      them from acting (if you have no choice but to act ethically then you are 
      little more than a lab rat pressing prescribed buttons). I'd welcome ideas 
      on game mechanics that reward those who act according to the Virtues. But 
      they can't be just Pavlovian game mechanic levers that one can push, or 
      they will fail in that ultimate goal. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As far as cracking 
      down on cheating, harassing, and other such extra-fictional forms of unethical 
      behavior--we do punish people. In fact, right now we're on a bit of a crusade 
      about it, and we're seeing quite a lot of whining from those who have been 
      caught (visit any of the cheat-oriented sites like Dr. Twister's for evidence 
      of this). </font></p>

    PvP/PvE skills, player levels, and gaming systems from alt.games.everquest. 
    (This is as part of a continuing dialogue, thus may seem a bit disjointed 
    without posting 30 pages of text. I've included quoted text from some previous 
    posters to try to maintain some semblance of context.)</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a common 
      phenomenon in PvP for a relatively low level character to take out a higher 
      level one through the application of good tactics...</font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depends on the 
      game... in a system where the difference between a newbie and a high level 
      character is great (regardless of whether it is a level based or skill based 
      system) PvP tactics mean less. Obviously in a system where the difference 
      in stat/skill/weapon/etc. based power between a newbie and a high level 
      character isn't so great, PvP tactics mean more. It could be argued that 
      the latter is better suited for a PvP environment, and the former for PvE.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">>That is simply not true. It

    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Give it time--I 
      am telling you that in time, players will find tactics to defeat these monsters. 
      Yes, the support staff will be right behind them scrambling to correct the 
      method used, but nonetheless it will happen. I would be very surprised if 
      there had not already been approximately a 5 level decrease in the capability 
      of mobs in EQ relative to players of the same level (in fact, I don't need 
      to be surprised, I've already heard of methods specific classes use to kill 
      5 levels above their capability).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">>And a GM *can* (and probably 
      has in the case of EQ) make mobs that no <br>
      >L50 player can defeat. Look at lady Vox, it takes 30 high level <br>
      >players to kill. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My magic crystal

    <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My magic crystal 
      ball says that we'll upgrade Lady Vox before that occurs :)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a very 
      common thing in muds. Let me describe a "Lady Vox" I put in a mud once: 
      it was a vampire that resided in a closed room with a locked door. The instant 
      you walked in, it slammed and locked the door behind you, blinded you, summoned 
      helpers to take you out, and attacked with a full arsenal of magic spells. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When it first 
      went in, it was utterly deadly. It took a carefully coordinated group of 
      10 people to kill it. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, it is 
      routinely soloed. Despite its capabilities having been *upgraded* in the 
      meantime, and player capabilities being downgraded to match. Players figured 
      out tactics to deal with it, and soon were superior in organization and 
      execution.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I pretty much 
      agree with this, and think it's a very important part of an evolving game. 
      Players get better, obtain more knowledge, more items of power, etc. and 
      can over time accomplish that which their predecessors couldn't. This is, 
      imho, a good thing -- it creates a sense of accomplishment, and even nostalgia, 
      for long time players.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">>See, the designer can ALWAYS 
      add tougher mobs. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are massive 
      pitfalls here. To list the two most important ones: </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) this means 
      (mathematically) that the game as a whole loses a degree of accessibility 
      to newbies. Features and things to do will tend to be added at the high 
      level in order to satisfy the high level players demanding greater challenge. 
      It is a very common thing to see muds where 90% of the zones are intended 
      for groups of maxxed out characters only. Newbies are reduced to one or 
      two areas per level range, and the entire process of levelling up is seen 
      as just "the prelude to the real game." This renders the game less friendly. 
      UO suffers from this ("build your character to GM, then go play") and so 
      does EQ ("the game doesn't really start until level 10"). It is a bad thing. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) It runs the 
      risk of unbalancing the entire economy and creating a Monty Haul system. 
      The addition of higher level areas implies the addition of cooler and more 
      powerful items to serve as rewards in those areas. Over time, these items 
      filter down into an economy that has insufficient drains. The average standard 
      of play rises as a result, and the previously difficult areas are rendered 
      less challenging. So, the designer can ALWAYS add tougher mobs, which means 
      even more powerful items, which...</font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think #2 balances 
      out #1 in that the lower level player will become more powerful over time 
      just as the higher level player does, as more items and areas are added, 
      and existing areas and items are upgraded. It's merely the responsibility 
      of the designers and maintainers to remain vigilant and monitor and react 
      to this normal and natural game evolution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">>But MUDs have very limited resources. 
      How many MUDs you know have a <br>
      >team of 30 people looking after it? </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Er, pretty much 
      ALL the established muds do.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, but typically 
      they aren't paid and aren't able to devote 40+ hours a week to maintaining 
      their MUD.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">>I do admit that the designers 
      will never catch up with the most rabid <br>
      >power levelers. But look at the average. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The average will 
      take up the tools of the highest achievers. This is normal. They want to 
      feel "competitive."</font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It does take 
      time, though, for these 'tools', whether it be knowledge or items or what 
      have you, to trickle down. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">>I am a L24 now after about 3 
      months of play. Let's say I average a <br>

      >Level 50 in about 26 week, 6 months from now. <br>
      <br>
      >The EQ expansion set will be out by then. And btw, I am assuming I <br>
      >ONLY play this one character without making another one. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are big 
      assumptions implicit in that statement which I don't want to uncover for 
      fear that I'd be seen as bashing EQ (which really isn't my intention). Suffice 
      it to say that it assumes that the actual form of play is altered by addition 
      of character types or expansions. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You lost me on 
      this one Raph -- and don't worry, I know you're not bashing EQ :) </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why does the 
      'form of play' have to be altered by additional character types or world 
      expansions? Did T2A do this?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">>Brad once made an estimate that 
      an average player (20-30 hrs per week) <br>
      >will take a year to 18 month to reach level 50. That is more than <br>
      >ample time to put on an expansion that extend the life of the game for 
      <br>
      >another 6 months. Notice that since a lot of mechanics are already in <br>
      >place, adding new areas, spells, abiliities and mobs will be a lot <br>
      >resource efficient. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I predict that 
      the longer the game runs, the less time it will take for people to reach 
      level 50 from scratch; I also predict that the longer the game runs, the 
      less time it will take to exhaust a given expansion. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the world 
      was left alone, yes. If the world is modified such that it keeps up with 
      the deflation we are talking about, then not necessarily. The rate of deflation, 
      of course, must be monitored and controlled, but it is not in and of itself 
      a bad thing. The alternative is a totally closed entropic system, which 
      I'm not sure I've ever seen work, and I'm pretty darn sure wouldn't be too
