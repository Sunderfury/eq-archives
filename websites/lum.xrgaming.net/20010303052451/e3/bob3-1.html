  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chaucer never would have written 
    about this kind of crap. It's one thing to write about pilgrims on a holy 
    march, but what about geeks going to a gaming convention? The epic poem could 
    take place in an airport terminal. Instead of a tale of the knight, we can 
    have the tale of the Unix administrator. Instead of the nun, we can have a 
    tale told by a game booth girl. That's why I'm really going to E3, don't you 
    know. I'm a journalist, and this is where the story is. By finding out why 
    people go to E3, I hope to write the pivotal work of English literature of 
    the 21st century. This is a noble calling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="bob31.jpg" width="175" height="262" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">Who 
    the hell am I kidding? I'm going because I have crossed the threshold from 
    geek to uber-geek. I can claim that I'm a journalist all I want, but when 
    I look at my face in the mirror, I have to live with the fundamental fact 
    that I'm traveling 1500 miles for a geek convention about computer games. 
    I was planing on going long before I got this gig writing for Lum's. Somebody 
    once said "when ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise". Quite so. In that 
    spirit, I wish to present a list of excuses for going to E3: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>It's a good place to network 
    with the game industry: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yeah, that sounds good. I want 
    to work for a game company. I want game companies to know that they can hire 
    me for cheap. I also want them to know that if they hire me, they can also 
    have my journalistic integrity. Sick of being viciously made fun of on Lum's? 
    Give me a nice office somewhere and some vague job description and I'll sell 
    your product like a Mexican pimp. You hear me, Nintendo? I think Pokeman:Online 
    is the best fucking game ever. How does that sound to you? You've been told 
    that you can't buy good press. We both know that's not true. Oh sure, some 
    would consider me a sell out, but there's much more pride involved in calling 
    myself a corporate whore than admitting the truth that I'm actually excited 
    about going to a gaming convention. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>It's payback time: </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The vicious bastards in the game 
    industry have sucked twenty years out of my life. I think of all the countless 
    hours I've spent in front of my computer, and I weep like a little girl. From 
    Ultima on the Apple II, to Pirates on the Atari 800xl, to countless games 
    of Civ and Wing Commander and finally Ultima Online, I've wasted my time on 
    earth. I couldn't help it. Because of people like Will Wright, Sid, Chris 
    Roberts and Raph Koster making such good frickin' games, I never stood a chance. 
    Well, now it's payback time. They're all going to be there. Savage beatings 
    for everyone...except that California has some crazy law where you're not 
    allowed to get medieval on people's asses, so I guess that excuse doesn't 
    work either. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><img src="bob32.jpg" width="200" height="305" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">It's 
    my job to cover the story: </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's not my job. If it was my job, 
    I would be getting bigger paychecks. Let's face it, I write about a very small 
    segment of the gaming industry. Sure, I'll be able to see the booths by OSI, 
    Verant, Turbine and G.O.D. but that's a small part of the convention. It's 
    not like I couldn't cover this event from my own home instead. There will 
    be so many damn game sites there, one more doesn't matter. That's not a good 
    enough excuse either. You know the real reason? Booze and games. That's it. 
    I want demo disks and posters, I want to play new games and drink heavily. 
    I expect to be entertained by the suits in the booths, and they better do 
    a damn good job of it. I want to be distracted. I want to be thrilled shocked 
    and amazed and kept to busy to understand the reality of the situation. I 
    want to walk out of the convention with a plastic bag full of freebies. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My wife shakes her head sadly when 
    I excitedly tell her of my plans. She knows what's really going on.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm a game geek and I'm going to 
    E3. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't want your pity, only your 
    understanding. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chaucer just wrote Canterbury Tales 
    to cover up the fact that he was excited about going to a convention. I'm 
    sure of it. </font></p>
