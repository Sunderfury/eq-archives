      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Lum's Better Half
      plays UO and EQ and can be persuaded of anything given enough chocolate.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The recent updates from Origin got me to thinking
      about how Origin and other companies relate to their customers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">My, my - customer relations - a nightmare at any
      company. Much more so when it's a service - not a product. Throw in
      evolution of a project as a work in progress - a healthy dose of customers
      that desperately want to be part of a bigger constructive process,
      limitations on technology, and you have the scenarios we see currently
      playing at OSI, Verant - and soon - Microsoft.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">I don't envy these folks - I really don't - they
      have forces tugging them in every direction and it's up to them to keep
      the boat afloat. To consider all angles - and decide what is best for the
      game/world as a whole and do so within what is physically possible with
      the technology available.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">First - let's examine what a MMRPG -- as a persistent
      world -- is.</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial">To the company: It generates revenue from initial
          sales - and from renewing subscribers. It is a product and it is a
          service.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial">To the user: It provides a framework to create a
          life in a virtual world and society. It's entertainment. It's a way to
          share with other humans in a way no other genre to date has provided.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial">Now, while all 3 of the current and upcoming games
      of this genre claim to be worlds - so far, UO has by far the most impact
      and potential of 'creating and living a virtual life'. EQ has pretty eye
      candy - but not very much structure for a community to spring up around,
      and what little I've seen on AC - it has the same problem.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">This genre cannot successfully be administrated in
      the fashion that all other games before it can - for the sole reason that
      they are TRYING to create persistent societies of human users. Once a
      community starts to form - it is human nature to want SOME input into the
      world around one. It is also a very basic human need to want to make a
      mark of SOME kind on the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">One reason the item decay proposal strikes at the
      heart of so many users - item accumulation has been one way many people
      feel they have 'made their mark'.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There are other ways people make their mark - some
      are good, some are bad, some are personal, some are more visible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Building organizations or places that become well
      known is probably one of the hardest - yet most visible - and community
      oriented activities for making ones mark. Ask Kazola - or consider what
      caused Origin to add the &quot;Priests of Mondain&quot; to Siege Perilous.
      Those that contributed to building both these establishments - and all the
      others scattered across the shards - will be remembered. If not for
      themselves - for what they built and inspired.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The flip side of this are people that go out of
      their way to become infamous. Well known perhaps, but very few of these
      are long remembered once they are gone.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Placing a house - much more modest, but visible and
      useful. This is a very important goal for a lot of folks, it invests them
      in the world. Some like to decorate and highly personalize, there really
      should be ways they can do this without compromising server performance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Along with houses - 'stuff' is some folks counter -
      they need other ways to demonstrate visible wealth, it's obviously
      important to them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Another subset of players are basically armchair
      designers - they make suggestion websites, post on message boards,
      subscribe to mailing lists. They try to make their mark by more directly
      influencing the designers with ideas - and trying to dialogue in a
      reasonable manner for the betterment of the worlds design.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Now, what has all this to do with this genre?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">One of the key differences between UO and EQ besides
      the eye candy - besides community - is lack of feedback from Verant. There
      are just as many mailing lists - just as many websites - just as many
      people interested in EQ developing into a world that can be lived in - but
      dialogue is all very one sided. People talk, but it's a VERY rare occasion
      when Verant talks back. This leaves the player community with the feeling
      that Verant is the enemy - that they are not listening - this is deadly to
      community building.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Microsoft - well, AC isn't out of beta - we don't
      know what they are going to do.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">UO has historically had much more an open dialogue
      with it's user base. Sometimes in dream sessions - players have
      misconstrued ideas for promises - this can cause problems.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There is a difference between kicking around ideas -
      and tackling a problem.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Being a company - most companies don't particularly
      like giving competitors any more information than they have to - although
      looking at what the two up and comers learned - and more importantly what
      they IGNORED from lessons in UO - it appears that information readily
      available by playing, by reading user feedback - is and has largely been
      ignored. It boggles the mind that such user feedback would be ignored -
      but it has been - it's obvious that the 'designers viewpoint' is still
      paramount - user be dammed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There is a new dev team - there is new management -
      and there is MUCH less dialogue going on now than ever before in UO's
      development history.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Technically - they make a product - it's theirs - we
      just pay for playing. They can make horses pink, the ground blue and the
      sky orange (umm, UO doesn't have a sky - never mind) if they want.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">What this does not take into account is that the
      REASON people play - and the reason they KEEP playing - is because this is
      an online society. When humans form communities - they tend to want some
      say - some representation into how the rules around them work. Does every
      player have a burning desire to change things - or take the time to make
      posts or essays or websites? No - lots just want a world to play in - but
      they ALL have opinions - they all want to make their mark one way or
      another.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">In the traditional single player game - or even in
      session based online games - you walk into a set of rules - you play - you
      win or lose (either a game - or a session). The mechanics of the world
      aren't ever shifting after the fact - you either like it, or you don't -
      no persistence involved. In an evolving product - with long-term persistent
      ramifications - a different set of dynamics come into play.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Not every person in our world picks up a picket sign
      and marches - but that doesn't mean they aren't concerned about issues -
      sometimes they just watch as others more motivated do the dirty work. Does
      every person run for office - no - but they usually vote for folks that
      seem to have the issues they are concerned to represent them. Also - polls
      are a politicians bread and butter - they not only (appear) to listen to
      their constituency - they spend LOTS of bucks polling to 'get the pulse'
      of the people. They are accountable at voting time - ignore the people you
      work for too much - you aren't around next time. Even when unpopular
      things are done - it is political suicide to not TRY to build a consensus
      of the public. The mark of a great leader is listening - building
      consensus - then going forward with the best answer for the most people
      without crippling others.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">In any case - information and dialogue and input is
      critically important.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Now, looking at this as they created this world -
      it's their property - they are god. Being human - they are very imperfect
      ones - with a lot of room for improvements.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Looking at it from the perspective that without
      users, and without people forming communities you have nothing but a
      program running on a box - you have something more akin to a country.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Countries without representation are called
      dictatorships. Not necessarily a bad thing - but people tend to resent
      living under dictators - even benevolent ones. People try to escape
      dictatorships.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Countries with representation - well, we might not
      be any better off, but at least we FEEL like we might be able to make a
      difference. People bitch and moan - but usually don't try to flee.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Why have UO players stuck around thru so much? Why
      have they held on? Why have they not given up?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Mainly - because we have gotten feedback on issues -
      we knew we were listened to and considered - it might take forever, but
      it's 'on the list' (tm) - and by golly - sometimes they do get done.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">As madding as some things have been - as disgusted
      as we get at things that just don't make sense - as long as it's taken for
      some things to be implemented or fixed - we had one thing - HOPE.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">When people feel heard - they become allies - people
      working towards a common goal, even if the details may be opposing
      viewpoints. When people feel shutout - they become enemies - they feel
      alienated and will not put up with nearly as much.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">I have no idea how many people constitute the 'dev
      team' - I would venture a guess that there are many thousands of players
      for every one of them however. There are as many play styles and agendas
      as there are players. There is simply no way that even the brightest and
      well motivated designers can possibly anticipate what so many different
      people consider important. This does not mean every idea has to be
      implemented, it does not mean every idea is even worth serious
      consideration - it does mean that taken in aggregate - users tend to fall
      into definable groups - and that most of their ideas and feedback IS of
      invaluable use as to how it affects THEM. Taken as a whole - this is stuff
      that adds depth and life to a world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">All this said - we do have a vote of sorts - we vote
      with our dollars. These worlds aren't just games that you can win and sit
      on a shelf - they weren't designed to be that way - once you invest
      hundreds of hours 'building a life', it's damn hard to let go and
      experience a virtual death. These companies are well aware of this - this
      is the hook. Still - people will only put up with so much, when hope is
      gone, there is no reason to continue. It's a heck of a lot easier to flee
      a virtual dictatorship - than a real one - all you need is a better place
      to go.
