Origin has only about 10 paid "game masters" on site, and about 10-15 more paid "Shard Lead Counselors" working from their home for a nominal, less-than-minimum-wage sum. The rest of the volunteer force, which numbers in the hundreds, is all unpaid. Everquest and Turbine have similar staff figures (Verant doesn't pay their senior volunteers, for example, but has more on-site GMs). <br><br>If companies are ruled liable for paying wages to their volunteer staff, expect them to go away. And the impact on the industry to be dramatic - if not catastrophic. There is no way that game companies can afford hundreds of on-site technical support staff and remain profitable. <br><br>Much easier to give them <a href="/review/uor/newsmith.jpg">funny blue hats</a>.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000320.html">Without smurfs, this site would be much less fun.

FOR A CHANGE, LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMEONE BESIDES ORIGIN</b></font><br><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><i>Friday, May 19, 2000 - 9:00 AM</i> [Filed by <a href="mailto:lum@xrgaming.net">lum</a>]</i></font><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Fatbabies.com, the game industry's presumptive successor to the notorious BitchX, has as today's rumor <a href="http://www.fatbabies.com/fatrumors.html">some musings about Verant</a> that they picked up from E3. Here's some quotes to ponder:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Verant resources are stretched thin, as tech teams struggle to maintain the Sony Station servers, as well as the Everquest servers, as well as the company&#8217;s own internal network.  The strain is showing, as downtime at both The Station and Everquest has caused the customer base to become dissatisfied with the lack of service. <br><br>We spoke with a few employees who acknowledged the huge delays associated with Everquest 2, as the focus has been on Star Wars Online (sucking resources from other projects).  Some were dissatisfied and seemed to have quite low morale. <br><br>On the other hand, the Verant Austin guys (ex-Origin and Ultima Online guys Rich Vogel & &#8220;Designer Dragon&#8221;) showed up at the Verant booth and had the attitude of &#8220;you guys suck and you&#8217;re lucky we&#8217;re here to save you.&#8221;  <br><br>We expect to see some defections out of the San Diego office, potentially mass defections, as the rapid growth has Verant bloated into a complete lack of organization.  And with the &#8220;us vs. them&#8221; mentality which the guys out of Austin seem to foster, the house of cards that John Smedley built could come crashing down soon. <br><br>We see the current list of projects on their plate, in order of priority: <br><br>1. Sovereign <br>2. EQ2 <br>3. Tanarus 2 <br>4. Verant Austin's project (Star Wars Online?) <br>5. A PS2 project <br>6. EQ live <br><br>Clearly the currently live Everquest is going to suffer, as it is the last priority.  Just read some of the EQ messageboards, and you&#8217;ll notice the dissatisfaction with the lack of results the company has produced.</font><br><br>My take (and you knew it would be different):<br><br>Their take on Verant Austin is all wrong, although it's interesting in that it may actually be Verant San Diego's <i>perception</i> of the new boys on the block. Raph Koster in particular may not be the most humble of folks when talking game design philosophy, but he is certainly not the kind to strut and do the victory dance. Bottom line - the Origin defectors had dozens of offers to sift through, and they chose Verant. Obviously there was a reason for this, and it wasn't to rub Brad McQuaid's nose in the dirt about Everquest.<br><br>As for their new project? <b>I'm positive it's not Star Wars Online</b>. For one thing, Brad McQuaid's the producer of the title, which implies a team located in San Diego. Look for the Verant Austin team to come up with an entirely new title, which is probably why they accepted Verant's offer of employment in the first place - the chance to work on something new.<br><br>Of course, the troubles at Verant San Diego described are obvious to anyone who plays EQ. The only contact Verant has with the players is Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn, who more than anyone else is responsible for Jonathan "Calandryll" Hanna's recent promotion at Origin - "Jesus, we could have done a <b>lot</b> worse." It's rare when a company PR rep actually <i>damages</i> your company's reputation, but Abashi's "we know the game, you don't, so stfu!" attitude manages this feat on a daily basis. So why doesn't someone pull Abashi's plug? <b>They all agree with him.</b> Verant's bunker mentality, reinforced by the crack-induced ravings of 60th level addicts on a constant basis on almost every Everquest-related message base, dictates that the Company is right, and the customers are wrong. Which may be adequate if hubris-filled from a game design standpoint, but is not the most effective way to run a business.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000318.html">"We consider our company balanced and no further discussion on this topic will be maintained."</a></b></font><br><br>

What those penalties are are in flux but they will be fair.</font><br><br>One last question: I attributed to you a statement which was more a summary of what I had gotten from our dinner conversation: "PKs are not welcome in my game".

Specifically, people are saying that Wolfpack wasn't showing off Shadowbane's engine, but a pre-rendered movie of that engine.<br><br>To be PERFECTLY CLEAR, Shadowbane's engine (called the Arcane Engine, I think because it was done by a guy named Arcane) was being shown at E3. Now, there wasn't any actual net connections to Wolfpack's trailer, since as we all know GoD was more concerned with lining up the weirdo midgets and lesbian pr0n then actually, you know, worrying about infrastructure issues. So the Wolfpack guys took an in-engine movie (not a rendered movie), one of the engine's features, and were showing that. While not live, it was being played within the Arcane engine itself. We weren't able to see what kind of framerate the Arcane engine has when being used over a modem, but that was about it. Everything else - interface, graphics, etc. - was being rendered by the Arcane engine. In fact, the way the Arcane engine's movie works is to actually take the "network feed" from a text file then from the modem. Thus, it's almost like you were really there, only you weren't.<br><br>So, um, please don't kill me. Thank you.</font><br><br>

Sensei at <a href="http://thedojo.extropian.org/">the Dojo</a>, who obviously has better contacts at Verant than we do, is reporting that ninja looting is the next "behavior modification" to be patched in. To quote:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">If confirmed by a Verant GM, ninja-looting will result in disciplinary action up to and including player suspension or banning. Ninja-Looting is when a player, disregarding the players or player who killed a mob, loots an item that is generally regarded as significant or valuable from the mob they did not kill. When a CS Rep receives a petition reporting ninja-looting, they are to contact the petitioner, gather preliminary information, and escalate to a GM for resolution. Determination of whether or not an item is 'generally regarded as significant or valuable' is left to the GM's discretion as directed by Verant Management.</font><br><br>OK, so what is "ninja looting" (or "yoinking", as I prefer to call it) in English? Here's the deal.<br><br>Most of the REALLY COOL LEWT in Everquest is what is called NO DROP. That means that you can't trade it, you can't give it to your level 4 friend, you can only use it if you loot it. No worries there, right? Well, the kicker is that as you increase in levels, your relative power in Everquest vs. monsters decreases consistently. At level 1, you can pretty much kick everything's butt that's your level or maybe even one or two higher. At level 25, you are going to have to group to get anything done. And at level 50 (taking everyone's word for it mind you, since level 50 characters to me are like minor godlings that move in more rarified planes of existence that I can only wonder at) the more important/interesting creatures require <b>multiple groups of characters</b> to kill. That's the kicker - because you can only loot something off of a monster that <b>your group</b> kills. There's no support for multiple-group kills in EQ.<br><br>So the upshot. You're a Shadowknight, and your guys just killed Erollsi Marr, who drops the Hairpin of Ungodly Might. It's a shadowknight only item. It's no drop. The only hope of your getting the Hairpin of Ungodly Might is to kill Erollsi Marr. Which you just did. Only, you were in the melee group, whose job it was to get hammered on while the group behind you, the finger-waggling caster brigade, actually got credit for the kill. No one in the caster group is a shadowknight. They don't want the hairpin. They can't use it. If they loot it, the only thing they can do with it is to throw it away.<br><br>So what do you do? Well, the only thing that groups do in this situation - sit and wait for the timer on the corpse to go off. You see, the limits on who can loot a corpse expire after 5 minutes or so. Then anyone can loot Erollsi Marr's steaming husk. So you sit around and wait 5 minutes so that you can get your rightful reward for helping to slay the Goddess of Love. So everyone's kicking back, cracking obscene jokes in /guildchat, waiting for the timer to expire, when some random stranger comes walking by and calmly loots the corpse. That's ninja looting. Needless to say, it pisses people off. A lot.<br><br>Now, there's a lot of things that can be done about ninja looting. You could code in support for multiple group credits for kills. You could set a timer for looting no drop items that allowed you to trade them, say, the first 3 minutes after you looted them. You could even allow the looting group to re-designate who has looting rights for the corpse. All these remedies would make sense, and would actually, you know, preserve the original intent of the loot timer - limiting who can loot a kill to who actually had something to do with it. <br><br>But, you know, coding remedies is HARD. Much easier to just write up an official sounding rule actually <b>codifying</b> what players are doing to work around a failure in the game system, saying "You can't ninja-loot" instead of <b>fixing the game so that ninja looting isn't an option</b> and make the guides enforce it. You know, since the guides in Everquest don't have enough to do already with flitting around the servers ensuring that everyone is playing nice under penalty of linkdeath. <br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000315.html">You have dishonored my family!
