other. Before, no action was taken when it was obivious it was needed (GM's were 

visible and present to witness the acts). Now, it seems that people are getting 

banned due to miscommunications and for not wanting to play 24/7 to make a 

decent blacksmith. Just because I bitch one day that we need more police 

officers and then bitch the next that Rodney King was a victim of police 

brutality..does that make me a hypocrite? hmm..that's something to ponder at 

least.</font></p>

            level simply because their role as provider of our online service 

            constrains them from doing so. They can only offer blanket assurances

            is that these people that he kills constantly page GMs about him. 

            Since he kills the same people over and over ( the 30 or 40 people 

            who regualarly go to the terathan keep and havnt learned not to blade 

            around us yet) he gets alot of pages about him. They just cant take 

            care of themselves and dont want to accept responsibility for their

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">I got sent to jail 

            too because I was in town fighting some TPK or whatever.. Jopok. I 

            forget, but thats not the issue.. I was fighting with some guy, and 

            I got kinda close to the other orange.. Well anyways he wasnt wearing

          armour, and I knew right off he was in the wrong part of town not 

            to be wearing any armour so I strayed off the guy I was on, and attacked 

            him. Well since the other guy was a townie he couldnt do a thing to 

            protect his friend that had crashed. Long story short, he was trying 

            to loot his friend, and I killed him too. So I got a crashed mage, 

            and a townie all in one fell swoop. About 10 minutes later Im in my 

            house iding some stuff and putting away the 100 of each regent I collected 

            from the mage. (too bad there were no keys and runes) Well, I got 

            put in jail as I was putting away regents and a gm said that he didnt 

            like the way we played. I wasnt thinking about getting screenshots 

            *damn*. I was really pissed. I asked what I did, and he said I did 

            something to make 5 people call a gm on me. I told him that I killed 

            a couple people in Trinsic, and he asked how 1 person could kill 2. 

            Well I said one was a mage, and he went down fast. I didnt mention 

            he was crashed, because im sure they didnt. Well, he said I needed 

            to change my &quot;style of play&quot;.. What a load of horse shit. but fuck

            us :) - </font> </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">1. GMs do not ban 

            people on the word of a group alone. </font> </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">2. GMs do investigate 

            players who are complained about frequently. </font> </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">3. The GM in this 

            scenario chose poor words to try to describe the situation in this 

            call. Essentially, the information is correct. And it was true that 

            the player was suspected of harassment (playing in a style unbecoming 

            a UO'r). However, during the course of this call, the GM chose poor 

            words in saying that: even if a player is not cheating, if other players 

            complain about him, he will have to change his playing style or be 

            banned. </font> </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">There are at least 

            two things a GM might say in this kind of call. They are as follows:

          </font> 

            </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">One better word choice 

            might have been: something about how this person plays is causing 

            an anomoly that is suspiciously like those created by people who cheat, 

            and that both the player and OSI need to investigate what it is in 

            order to make it stop. </font> </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Or another, appropriate 

            to this particular case: the player is engaging in behavior that could 

            be construed as harassment. Examples of harassment could include: 

            Hunting down the same person over and over and over again in order 

            to be malicious. Using racial slurs or strong vulgarity during the 

            kill could also be considered harassment. If this is witnessed by 

            the GM while investigating the player, then a banning may occur. </font> </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">4. We do not ban for 

            player killing, but we do ban for harassment. Unfortunately, harassment 

            often follows, or preceeds, player killing. GMs are trained to tell 

            the player that player killing is legal, but that they should watch 

            their verbal behavior both before and after player killing to avoid 

            harassment charges. </font> </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">5. In this situation, 

            the call should have been turned over to a lead, but wasn't. This 

            was a mistake on the GMs part. The GMs, at times, feel that they can 

            answer more delicate calls which should be escalated. They are being 

            trained to better recognize the difference. </font> </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">In short, we don't 

            ban one person to make 20 people happy if the only evidence is the 

            word of 20 people. All situations are investigated. If we actually 

            did what that implies, then any guild could just as easily gang up 

            on &quot;nice folks&quot; and cry foul, getting the &quot;nice folks&quot; banned. Without 

            enough evidence, OSI doesn't ban. </font> </i></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">This situation really 

            has been blown out of proportion, but I hope that this will help calm 

            the waters a bit. I understand that another GM spent quite a bit of 

            time trying to talk to this player to explain this, but that the player 

            wasn't interested in any conversation, only in proving that &quot;Origin 

            does not like pks&quot;. If Origin were that against Pkilling, we would 

            remove it from our game totally. </font> </i></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">I was under the impression 

            that many GMs, not just Jakarta, were recently telling players the 

            &quot;we'll ban 1 player to keep 20 happy&quot; line. This may well 

            be the wrong impression, as the only confirmation I've found have 

            been those screenshots. If anyone has any, preferably screenshots, 

            logs if not, of interactions with GMs that echoed this line, especially

            these days Ive been playing a murderer character. I dont harrass anyone, 

            I just kill people. So as you can see, to play my character I do two 

            things which OSI doesnt approve of; i use UOA and I macro when I die. 

            Im sure its only a matter of time before Im banned due to a group

            watching the very first player run establishment get the very first

            asshole by the name of The Great Lord Willie Nelson, three or four

            actually tried to solve the problem by spawning Air Elementals to 

            run off the PKs. What else could he do? Livid, I made a public spectacle,

            The first time I got to actually SEE my base skill points and that 

            slick interface counted my reagents, I knew there was no going back.&nbsp;The 

            only reason UOassist has not gone away is because Tug is an older 

            guy who can't be bought with a dazzling counselorship&nbsp;and or

          seership, which I commend. That said,&nbsp;the new policy on unattended

          macroing, and the Gestapo &quot;who's hiding a Jew&quot; tactics of

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="3">(1) Get a group of your 

            friends together (about 20 should suffice)</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="3">(2) Everyone page a GM. 

            Make your excuse somewhat believable (say, <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/let-pvp2.html" target="_blank">he 

            noto-PK'd you</a>).</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="3">(3) Wait for the GM to 

            get pissy because they actually have to take calls, and ban the offending 

            wretch.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="3">I know I harp on this 

            topic quite a bit, and that most (probably all, actually) of the people 

            targeted are worthless wastes of pixels that could be better utilized 

            on everyone's screen. Still. Is <b>everyone</b> who &quot;plays in 

            a suspicious manner&quot; being targeted for banning? Nope. It's haphazard 

            at best. </font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="3">Basically, the message 

            I get, and most players who don't spend all their time at four weddings 

            and a funeral get, is that you can be banned at any time, for any 

            reason, and your best defense is to just make sure the authorities 

            never notice you.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="3">Gee. If I wanted to live 

            that way, I wouldn't play UO, I'd move to Compton.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="3">I'm still pretty undecided 

            on various aspects of this, which is why I haven't posted an update 

            in a while, and welcome <a href="mailto:lum@webtoys.net">comments</a> 

            (and will post the better ones). This is something that merits further 

            discussion. </font></p>
