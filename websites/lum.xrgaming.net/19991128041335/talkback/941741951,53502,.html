Bear in mind that this is of course all totally unconfirmable, yadda yadda yadda. You're here for the dish, so here it is.<br><br>The scary thing is that, if this is true, posting wedding announcements on a web page pays almost as much as maintaining multi-million dollar database systems. Jesus wept.<br><br>FYI: I make zero from this website. <br><br>---<br><br>Admittedly, I've been behind in reading the boards on your site and the news  section, but a thread caught my eye today regarding the Vault network.<br><br>See, I know Thalshara of the UOVault. What should interest you is that I know Thalshara is personally making $2500 a month off her work on the vault. And she's just one person. It is indeed a business. I don't know how they're making their money (view banners, I imagine), but the question of news ethics has been discussed among her and <br>friends.<br><br>Here's the deal: In order to keep the currency flowing, they must have open access to information. Where do they get the best information? Well, OSI of course. OSI feeds the Vault information as long as the Vault refrains from criticizing OSI. This is basically why most scandals, screw ups, and just plain stupid behavior on the part of OSI is rarely found on the UOVault. If it is reported, it's in passing, sugar coated, and largely ignored. The only time you will see UO Vault post anything bad about OSI is when the issue is so large that they would look dumb for not posting it.<br><br>Basically, the UOVault is OSI's PR machine. Of course, this is pretty obvious to anyone with half a brain, but I thought you'd like to know that not only do Vault operators know about it, but they profit well from it and will continue to provide biased information to the players as long as there is money in the bank at the end of the month. They're very proud of themselves, and basically sold out to OSI quite some time ago. They know full well what they're doing. I know Vault operators personally, and I can truthfully say they are a group of greedy a**holes that no longer care about the game or the players. They used to, but now all they see is green.

Yeah, a witty guy like Lum can make a patch hilarious, but UOSS is more fact oriented than public opinion oriented.  Plus, the reporters and managers(dunno about higherups, but I believe the same) work for free, so they don't need to worry about ratings or the green, and can work happier with less pressure.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Anon end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->This is an excerpt from Eric Neuman's &quot;speech&quot; that he sent to myself, Darimar, Den, and others when we complained to Verant that they were favoring EQ Vault too heavily by giving EQ Vault exclusive news while leaving us out in the cold.<br><br>&quot;I'm also going to be a bit blunt here, but this point needs to get across <br>somehow. We're not just a fan site anymore, but a licensed business, and <br>we're handling a completely different market segment than most of you. <br> <br>Most gamers don't want to surf ten sites about the same game, looking for scraps of information. I'll admit some hardcore gamers do, but most don't have <br>the time or the patience. They want a place that they know and trust to quickly <br>get the latest information about a title, and we've worked extremely hard to <br>establish ourselves in this market over the past year, build a community of <br>online gamers who visit our sites, and develop relationships with the people <br>building these new online worlds. <br> <br><br>We get more traffic in a day than most of you have seen in months, and <br>you're going to have to accept that fact and move on. It makes sense for <br>the development teams on these games to answer some questions on our boards <br>where they know that most people will see them, instead of posting the <br>same thing on ten obcure fan sites where a large portion of their audience <br>will never see them. <br> <br>I'm sorry some of you feel you're getting cheated or something here <br>just because we're bigger than you, but get over it. <br> <br>Eric Neuman <br>Managing Editor <br>The Vault Network <br>http://www.vaultnetwork.com&quot;<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

Just because we don't go out of our way to critize UO doesn't mean that we are selling out.  I can't speak for the other news sites, but UOSS's main purpose is to post game news, quest and event news, shard news, and posting stratagy and statistics about Ultima Online to make the player's lives easier, not to post every rumor or scandle that comes along.  Frankly, thats what sites like Lum's here is partialy for and Twister uses his site for.  I hope that clears up what UOSS is and what it does.<br><br>-- Sl0th<br>Reporter, Alantic Shard, UOSS: &lt;http://uo.stratics.com/&gt;<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->

If someone can make money off his site, more power to him. Don't like his site? Don't go there. The Vault Network is not the friggin' New York Times. It doesn't have to equally trash and praise UO or OSI. I agree with Reg;most sites either totally trash OSI constantly(while still paying to play) or report fluff. Personally, I could care less about a new tavern opening OR how many ways OSI is purposly trying to destroy its entire fanbase. Lighten up,get a life people and enjoy the game.

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Anon2 end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Eric Neuman is an asshole.  I had dealings with him in email over a matter at one point and all I can say is that his &quot;we're a business&quot; speech pretty much sums up his attitude to the entire web community.  Sad, in a business that doesn't strictly NEED to be competitive.<br><br>Also they recently sold out to IGN.  I wonder how many of their volunteers got any compensation whatsoever for their work?  UOVault was hosted on Origin servers at one point, does Origin get a cut of the acquisition?<br><br>As for UOVault's &quot;editorial&quot; content (if you can call what is basically a moderated message board &quot;editorial&quot;), who cares?  If they don't want to post the seedy underbelly of UO, that's their prerogative.  All it does is make them look as undependable and unreliable as they currently do.  Hell, I know people who have sent in outright lies about unique items, fictitious in-game events and so on that have had their items posted without a thought.  Much of their news is directly copied from other sites anyway, although this is probably done by their readers and then sent in.<br><br>End result: Vault Network and all of their affiliates are sites that I will not visit under any circumstances due to their disrespect for the community.  They produce no original content anyway, so I'm not missing anything.<br><!--ktalk end_comment-->
