<b><font face="Verdana" size="4">Interview with Dr. TwisTer<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="3">Owner, <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/"> Dr. TwisTer Network</a><br>
</font></b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">(12/13/99) Dr TwisTer was born in a Siamese yurt. He enjoys poking holes in things with sharpened bamboo poles and wrote haiku for Chairman Mao. He is married, with 12 children.</font>
</i>
<hr>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&lt;Lum> First off, the big question, and feel free not to answer if legally constrained not to, but what were the terms of your settlement with Origin?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I had 5 basic agreements that needed to be met.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> 1. Apology letter<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> 2. Pay money, I can not disclose how much. But it wasn't a small amount.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> 3. Agree not to infringe on the intellectual properties of OSI/EA, or claim to be associated with them in anyway.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> The other two are just toppings....<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> 4. If I violate the understanding, I will be held liable for more damages<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> 5. I will release OSI/EA from future problems associated with this situation<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Regarding number 2. Was this figure tied to your projected revenue from your UO site, or was it based more on OSI's
perceived losses?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> They stated to me that it was in part compensation for attorney fees, however it was also due in part to estimated losses on their part&nbsp;<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> They could not come after monetary damages based on earnings from my site, because I don't make any money off of my site.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> You mentioned when you first talked about the legal action that they had threatened your family as well. How exactly did they do this?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> They cited myself, and my wife's name in the suit.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Does your wife have anything to do with your web site in any way?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> None.  She only knows it exists.  Other than that, she reads it about as much as Jinx.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> What reason if any was given for her being cited in the suit, then?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> None. My only assumption is, if they needed to, they would try to garner wages from both of us,
citing that she would know fully what I was doing, relation being my wife.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> If this had never happened, and someone sent you the full operating specifications, with the design timeline, for Everquest 2, knowing what you do now, would you post them?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> :) Nope.  Not worth the risk.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Fair enough. On to hopefully happier subjects:<br>
&lt;Lum> What do you see as your purpose in the community?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Well... I'm sure that is a hotly debated question.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Of course.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I know for a fact, based on good word, that OSI considers me to be "the
Antichrist of all online gaming"...&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Dammit.<br>
&lt;Lum> I thought *I* was.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> That is drastically different than the companies of Verant, Turbine, and Wolfpack are concerned.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Yes, but your coverage of those companies has been drastically different.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> True...<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I can see a difference in your style Lum as well...<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> How so?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> You cover UO news, quite different than you cover EQ news.... is there a reason for this?<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> You mean, aside from John Smedley threatening to sue me? :)<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Exactly...<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Actually, I play EQ more than UO or AC right now :)<br>
&lt;Lum> But I think my coverage of EQ is more negative because EQ's community outreach is so hosed.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Yea, I played UO everyday, and yelled at them every night.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> I'm not fond of AC as a game, for example, but I think my coverage of them as a company has been somewhat positive.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> It would seem that the games we enjoy the most, we are most critical of.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> There is obviously a difference from my point of view.  I am upset with OSI, and I don't hide my feelings.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> But you have to look at how they treat me as well.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> OSI, flat out hates me.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Turbine's Development team sends ME the bugs<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> and asks that I warn my audience accordingly<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Verant wants to work close with the site to make sure they fix the problems, and are willing to have testers chat with me in game to test bugs<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Well, again, I have to point out that the history between you and those companies are different as well.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Yes, that is the point.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> For example, do you think Verant treats you any differently after the client-side spell effect hack your site posted?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Well, I had a nice long conversation with Verant after that situation.  They explained their concerns with that type of information being posted.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Would such a hack be posted again?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> We have come to an agreement.  It's not a matter of what information is posted.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> It goes into why it is posted<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> The reasons behind posted this information is to better improve the game.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Verant believes this<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> We have worked out an agreement, that major bugs, like a hack, they would be notified in advance.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Also with the warning to the public, you can do this, but you will get banned.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> We are not about ruining the game, but improving it.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Do you have a similar agreement with Turbine?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Yes.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> And as I say with Turbine, they have sent me information on bugs, and problems in the game so that I can warn the public about them, and give the players a heads up on what they may experience when online.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Let's take a hypothetical...<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> ok<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Say someone mails you a foolproof dupe for AC. Easy to do, and you suspect that it is undetectable on the server side.<br>
&lt;Lum> Do you post it?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Based on our agreements, I would first send the information to the development team.  I would then log online to test the bug with someone.  Then we can post it.  The reason for posting it, is we have found, players usually can find more information than the testers. They are use to exploiting, so we benefit from their experiments.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> A similar situation just happened in AC.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> A bug came about that erased players.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> We posted information, and it helped Turbine to find the problem, but not completely.  They needed additional help testing the bug online and more information so that they can find a real solution.  They worked with our site to fix this quickly.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> But, you would post the dupe before Turbine had a chance to repair it?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> NO<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> We have worked out a time line.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> They usually only require a one or two day turnaround.  In some cases, they have asked for 3 days.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> After the first few days, if they have not fixed the bug, we post it.  This now forces them into their quality assurance.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> So, getting back to the original question, you see yourself as a QA tester for these games?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Well, the purpose has multiple functions.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I have always hoped that my site would be for the positive, unfortunately, OSI just brought out the worst in all of us.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I see the site doing a multitude of functions.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> 1. Yes, QA.  It helps to assure things are getting fixed, and accomplished quickly.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> 2. Public Relations, customer service.  We are giving players an opportunity to express their opinions about how the game is played from the players point of view.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> 3. Control and Development. We find things that they are unaware of and then help players to prepare for any problems they might face while online.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Many people have said that because of what you posted on UO, they had quit, lost their accounts, or given up on online gaming completely. What would you say to those people?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> If you lost your account, you were most likely exploiting a bug.  I guess you had it coming to you then.  I don't have much pity for individuals who get caught exploiting.  We all know the
consequences, you have the final decision what you do online.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> The others...<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I would have to say, if you left, because of something that happened to you in game, it's because you chose not to listen to what I had to say.  Those same situations for countless other players, the information posted on my site made them stay, because their house was not looted, or their vendors were not destroyed.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> But many times, you've posted bugs and exploits that were impossible to defend against.<br>
&lt;Lum> The mushroom house break-in for example.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Well, now you see a major problem.&nbsp;<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> First, you could defend against that bug.  There were ways of doing so with the placement of boxes and Book cases.  Now granted, that is too much trouble to deal with. So we look at the real problem with this exploit.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I posted the information on this bug several months ago.  OSI had several months to fix it before it became as wide spread as it did.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> This problem was fixed throughout 3 patches<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Eliminating the Z-axis<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Taking away certain stacking properties.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> However, OSI never did the one basic step they could have done, from the beginning to stop this bug.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> They could have deleted mushrooms.&nbsp;<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Now, if I post something, and OSI chooses not to fix it... should I be held to blame for it?<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I would understand after one week<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> but after 3 months, take the damn mushrooms out of the game.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Certainly OSI has a great deal of responsibility here.<br>
&lt;Lum> But the fact remains that once you reposted that bug, there was a rash of house lootings.<br>
&lt;Lum> Before you reposted that bug, there was not.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> The bug was never fixed<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> there were people doing house loots non stop<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> But not nearly as many.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Not as many as you think... there were only about 2 mushrooms on any one shard.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Do you think you are responsible in any way for those lootings?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> No.  It is fully the responsibility of OSI to figure out a way to fix the problem.  They did not.  If they would have, the houses wouldn't have been looted.  I supplied them with the information for it to be fixed, and it wasn't.  If I didn't post the information, the houses would have still been looted, we just wouldn't have heard about them.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> OK. What about this statement you made on your site last year, which attracted much attention:<br>
&lt;Lum> "Well, normally I don't post information I get from the Test Center, for obvious reasons, it gives us a better chance of getting the same bug on the private shards with the next patch."<br>
&lt;Lum> Would you say the same thing about Verant or Turbine's test servers?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I think you best summarized that today. I have indeed grown up a little.  Although my actions were always good at heart, I did see the enjoyment in my early days of the site, to be able to do what we would like in the game, and get away with it.  The test servers are meant to be exploited.  I have been offered to come online to various other game's test servers, and help the development team with information that I send them.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> This is constructive, value added, testing and development.  We obviously see that Turbine and Verant care about their players and the game.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Do you see where statements like those would not help your image at Origin?<br>
&lt;Lum> Or your habit of withholding bugs until after GM hours, for another example.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Could you see how not fixing bugs like they have done in the past has put a bad name for them in public eye and in the online gaming industry that other companies are strongly trying to overcome...<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Oh, quite easily. Even people who have no idea what UO is as a game have heard about the various lawsuits involved. I'm not absolving them in the slightest.<br>
&lt;Lum> However, I'm not interviewing them at the moment. :)<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> :)<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I understand what you are saying...<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Another topic.<br>
&lt;Lum> What's your opinion of LadyMOI? Why do you think OSI hired her?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> They needed a female to help handle all of the horny 14 year old PKs that they were about to nerf.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Speaking of PKs, were you a PK in UO?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> To the extreme sense, no.  Two of my character's were red, but I enjoyed the challenge of PvP more than anything.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I did go on a few PKing sprees, but always felt bad, and had to rez my victims.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Do you plan to go PvP+ in AC?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Already have.  Have a level 10 war mage on Darktide.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Gunning for Azile?<br>
&lt;Lum> Back to bugs and UO for a second...<br>
&lt;Lum> Now that you are presumably free of Origin's TOS, did you exploit any bugs yourself for personal gain?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> No, actually I did not.  I did personally test several bugs, but mostly on my own houses, characters and friends.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> If anything seriously went wrong, I paged a GM, or let a counselor know.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> So you never actually looted a house yourself, then.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Hmm, do we consider house looting a bug?  Or did you mean, using a mushroom, or other exploit to get house wealth?<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Using an exploit to gain entry as opposed to killing someone or stealing their key.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> No... like I said, I only tested house break-ins on my houses and my friends homes.  You have to remember, at some point in time, OSI knew who I was.  I didn't really want to risk losing my account knowing full well that they were watching me on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Were you ever the victim of an exploit?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I was a victim of OSI's bad programming.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Several Times...<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> How so?<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="http://uo.drtwister.com/pics/house.JPG"><br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> That was my first house. Nothing special, but to me, filled to the rim with my hard earned winnings<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Looks like some things are missing. Like walls?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> This was at the time OSI first decided they needed to experiment with the concept of limited the items that houses should be able to hold.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> A nasty house decay occurred...<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> not only did the items in my house decay, my house decayed too.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> GM Kal El came to visit me.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> He saw the same thing I did, along with my friend who was with me<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> they admitted this was a problem, and they would fix the situation.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I never saw that house or it's belongings again.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Oh well, only a game, I moved on.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Did you ever start a dialogue with any of the dev team in UO?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Always off the record.  They never wanted to admit publicly they had talked to me, then eventually, I think they were prevented from any contact with me.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Once you had started your site and gotten your fame/infamy/whatever, did you ever try contacting the dev team with any bugs/exploits that you had discovered?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I opened my site<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> and my updates several times to a better working relationship.  I actually tried to get the bad blood changed. They never responded.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> They never showed any desire to maintain a dialogue to help fix bugs.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> What sort of research and/or fact finding goes into your postings? Do you have a verification process when someone sends you a bug or a story of customer service abuse?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I admit, I used to more than I did towards the end.  My lack of interest obviously began to show in the last few months.  But many stories that you or others may think were fabricated, really were not. OSI used my bad rep as being a source to deny what I was stating.  It worked to their advantage in some situation, but in others, I had too much proof.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Actually, I was speaking more in general, not specifically for UO.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Oh...&nbsp;<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> :)<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> I do talk about other games occasionally.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> In General, as I stated before, I have free range to test things in EQ and AC without much trouble.  I try to do so when I can.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> It is hard considering I don't really play EQ.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> However, I do try and test what I can.  On the other side...<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I like to leave a lot of information up to the players to be able to experiment themselves.  One of the things that makes my site special I feel, is giving the players a feel that they are
involved.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> They can take the information and do with it what they want.  Believe it, test it, deny it, prove it to be true.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> One more question, and then we're done.<br>
&lt;Lum> Are we ever going to see TwisTerGear?&nbsp;<br>
&lt;Lum> I want a "U SUK" hat.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Lum, if you let me use your ideas, I'll make them! :)<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> I freely grant license for you to use any of the TwisTerGear artwork and/or slogans. Heh.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Do you want a cut?<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Not going to sue me are you?<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Nope, we've already proven there's not much to be made there.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> :) True.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> I think we're about done, anything you want to add?<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Sure...<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> I'm not asking any of your readers to agree with what I have to say.  I don't ask them to even like me... I don't care about that.  I do however care about the games, and the future of games as we play them.  I think there are some serious issues in the industry that still need to be answered, so all I ask is stop and look at my site from a different angle.  If you still don't understand it, fine, if you do, great.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum> Fair enough. Thank you for your time.<br>
<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Thank you Lum.</font></p>
