          <p><i><font size="3" face="Arial">Please bear with me on this - there is a point.<br>

          <br>

          In 1986 the Television program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired a documentary piece about a person suing the automobile manufacturer Audi.  The person

          complained that her Audi 5000 had accelerated when she stepped on the brake, and had caused an accident.  The woman had hired a firm of

          Automobile Engineers who demonstrated to the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; cameras exactly how this could happen.  When this piece was shown it caused a

          storm - people all over the place were suddenly complaining about this

          problem with Audi cars, suing Audi for damages, and trying to sell their Audi cars.  I had an Audi 5000 at the time and I saw it's value

          drop by 50% in a period of two months.  My local Audi dealer collapsed

          and the one in the next city shifted to another automobile make.  Sales

          of new Audi cars essentially dropped to zero in North America.<br>

          <br>

          The &quot;60 Minutes&quot; piece later won an award for investigative journalism,

          and was shown again several months later.  It was obvious to everyone that these cars had a major design problem that was not being addressed

          by Audi engineers.  Audi was sued by many who had an accident in an Audi car, or had an accident that involved an Audi car.<br>

          <br>

          Naturally the vehicle safety organizations in both the USA and Canada started a joint investigation into unintended acceleration in Audi

          cars.  Several years later they released their findings in a report.&nbsp;

          They found that:<br>

          <br>

          1.  Audi cars were not subject to more complaints of unintended acceleration than any other make of vehicle.<br>

          <br>

          2.  The automotive engineers who had performed the demonstration for the original &quot;60 Minutes&quot; piece had fully or

          partially disabled five different safety systems within the test car in order to make the

          demonstration work.  This had not been mentioned on the air.<br>

          <br>

          3.  All the effects of unintended acceleration were consistant with the

          driver stepping on the accelerator pedal when they intended to step on

          the brake.<br>

          <br>

          4.  No action was required by Audi as no safety issues were uncovered by their investigation.<br>

          <br>

          In other words, some woman had made a mistake, hired an unsavory firm of engineers, managed to get the attention of a major investigative

          television program, and succeeded in destroying Audi's reputation in the USA.  The woman eventually lost her case and was sued by Audi for

          misrepresentation due to the actions of the engineers she hired.  I think Audi could have successfully sued CBS, the network that owns &quot;60

          Minutes&quot;, but they chose not to.<br>

          <br>

          The point of all this may be apparent to you now.  Your many tales of unsubstantiated GM abuse and Counselor abuse are having a negative

          effect.  Because OSI is unable to comment, and you are completely unable to verify the truth of these claims, you are essentially

          becoming a party to the same sort of Big Lie technique that was used effectively in Europe in the 1930s.  In case you don't recall that era,

          the idea is that if you repeat a statement often enough and loud enough

          it will be believed, regardless of the merits of the statement.  This technique was used repeatedly and effectively in the anti-Jewish hate

          mongering politics of that time.<br>

          <br>

          I don't believe that you do intend to present an unbalanced viewpoint.&nbsp;

          But you are pandering to some individuals with an intent to hurt OSI.&nbsp;

          You are uncritical of these individuals, and continually repeat their statements lambasting an organization that cannot present their side of

          the issue effectively.<br>

          <br>

          This is a morally corrupt act by you, in my view.</font></i></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Some comments:</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">I am aware of European history in the 1930's.&nbsp;

          I may be guilty of many sins, but being the Joseph Goebbels of UO

          isn't exactly one of them.</font> <font face="Arial">Now that we've

          dealt with the Obligatory Nazi Reference, let's take the rest of the

          letter seriously. </font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">I've never denied OSI an opportunity to comment

          on anything posted here, and they have in the past done so, both

          officially and unofficially. While they have a policy on not

          commenting on specific instances of customer support, they have made

          their opinion on various outstanding issues known.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">That being said, I suspect the &quot;respectable

          sites&quot; (UO Vault, Stratics, uo.com itsownbadself)&nbsp; get

          considerably more hits than I do. This site isn't a respectable piece

          of journalism. It never intended to be. It's another voice (at times a

          particularly strident and obnoxious one). I think making as many

          opinions as possible is valuable, thus my penchant for turning a large

          part of this site over to &quot;guest commentators&quot; such as

          yourself. But overall, it's just me ranting away. Thus the site's

          title.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">So am I responsible for the villagers getting

          all rowdy and picking up torches to storm Lord British's castle? Nope.

          The feeling of discontent with OSI's support has always been there.

          Remember that lawsuit? While in the main frivolous, it had just enough

          actual merit to scare the crap out of EA. I'm certainly not making up

          &quot;Tales of GM Abuse Chapter 49&quot; because I dislike GMs or

          Origin or anything else. The Truth Is Out There, to quote a couple of

          sexually repressed Canadians. I just comment on it, hopefully in an

          amusing manner.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">For an insight into what goes into a Lumposting,

          let's track the one two stories down - the one about the house breakin

          and the GMs busting the macroer. How did I get the story? Not from the

          submitter... instead a friend of mine who is usually pro-OSI sent me

          this:</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial"><i>Check this one out. It's another account of a GM screwup.&nbsp; This board isn't normally full of 

whiners so you might like the thread.</i></font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">I did, and it seemed interesting enough to

          repost the URL of the message. I don't make any judgements on whether

          or not what is portrayed actually happened... just gave it a little

          publicity. Actually, I found the fact that GMs are taking the

          opportunity during other, unrelated calls to bust macroers to be more

          interesting than any gNu KeWl HouSe BrEAkIN. Despite what is said on

          their own site...</font></p>



          

          <p><i><font face="Arial">

Players should only call a GM to report others performing unattended macroing 

when it is interfering with their gaming experience</font></i></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">...not only are some players spending their time

          filling the GM queues with &quot;Player X is macroing

          unattended&quot;, it seems the GMs very actively want to get rid of

          macroing. Not being mandated, not being told to, but taking the

          initiative to crack down on it whenever they notice it.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">That's newsworthy, in my opinion, and is the

          subtext behind that post.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial">Do I believe every complaint that's sent to me?

          No. Do I post ever complaint that's sent to me? No. As someone else

          writes about this same story:</font></p>



          

          <p><i><font face="Arial">

Regarding the player quitting because someone with a wonderful bug and/or god client looted the house.&nbsp; While I don't doubt this possibility, I have

          to be a typical cynical ass and point out a possible different interpretation of events.&nbsp; Lets assume that I knew someone, was friended to

          their house, and coveted all their precious l3wT.&nbsp; What better way to

          make it mine then by taking everything, then claiming some &quot;cheater&quot; 

came in and took it all.&nbsp; Then simply summon a GM, and wait with your 

wonderfully concocted abuse story.&nbsp; Need verification that the GM was 

there?&nbsp; Well hell, just summon him knowing full well that hes going to boot 

the house owner macroing in the corner.&nbsp; Oh the humanity.. the shame.. the 

poor huddled masses yearning to be free.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhow, who's to know the 

better?&nbsp; Its not like OSI is going to come out and discuss the damn thing.&nbsp; 

All one has to do is be properly outraged, post a decent amount of posts 

about how &quot;I am cancelling my account&quot; and then just wait for your 

so-called friends to tell you its all ok and it really wasn't your 

fault.<br><br>End result: One l3wt3r comes out ahead and in a position to screw 

other people, just by playing to people's fear of big brother.<br><br>I 

would consider it a rather elegant plan myself.&nbsp; I'm not saying this is what 

happened, but what's to stop it?&nbsp; People are so ready to believe anything 

about OSI that they make a perfect scapegoat for all types of scams.&nbsp; Maybe 

if OSI talked a little more with its customers, and wasn't known for the 

huge delay in responding to problems, then this kind of thing&nbsp; wouldn't 

happen...period.</font></i></p>

Go to the Britain counselor's hall and talk with some of the Counselor 

Elders. I have on Pacific, Baja, and LS, and have always found someone 

willing to help with whatever problems I have, even if they were pretty 

far-out (like GM abuse). Lots of counselors stay there too. Vesper is also a 

good place to check, though it's not as populated.<br><br>2) Try calling a 

counselor NOW, and see how long it takes. When I'm online counseling (not as 

much as I'd like, unfortunately), the answer usually ranges from 2 seconds to 

2 minutes. Sometimes you even get counselors ranting good-naturedly at each 

other for having faster reflexes and taking calls the other was going for. A 

FAR cry from the old days, in my opinion.<br><br>Like I said, the old 

counselor program had serious problems. However, they're fixing those. 

Perhaps wiping the old system away and starting over would have been a good 

idea. It certainly would have dealt with the image problems of the old 

system. Unfortunately, they didn't. And I'm certainly not disagreeing that 

they need more regular support personnel.<br><br>Oh, and just so you know, 

counselors ARE liable for any abuses that occur. If a counselor is found 

abusing his powers, his account is canned on the spot, no warnings given. I 

wouldn't be surprised if the new &quot;store your log on the server&quot; 

option they're talking about is made a mandatory requirement for counselors, 

just to provide the same verifiability benefit that on-site GMs

conduct within UO.&nbsp; OSI didn't know how they wanted their game to develop.&nbsp; 

Diablo was common at the time so the PK crowd would be a definate draw and the 

enthusiastic Roleplayers who were looking for a game they could finnally play 

online could be a great crop to pick... Next we flash to a couple years later and now 

that UO isn't the sole online power it was before OSI can't rely on it being the 

'one and only' to draw it crowd.&nbsp; Time to give the game focus.&nbsp; Well you are too 

late.&nbsp; The world has evolved along lines never expected and now borders are 

being thrown down.&nbsp; A huge blob has formed and now in an attempt to make it more 

square an apealling part of the community is being chopped of because the don't 

quite fit in where before they were allowed to freeform.&nbsp; In adding control 

mostly the PVPers and Gamers are being effected because they are the ones that 

make extensive use of the game engine and notoriety systems... Has a patch gone in to yet effect roleplaying negatively?&nbsp; I'm sure 

serverside lag would be cut down considerably if all talking was banned from the 

game (I hope I'm not giving anyone an idea).&nbsp; Gamers and PVPers will take the 

brunt of all the changes and are now being forced to play differently then 

before,&nbsp; this isn't a bad thing but would not have to have come about if OSI had 

sat down at the begginning and put up a solid framework for society rather then 

let it grow and then chop pieces off when they began to think they were out of 

control...</i></font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial"><i>With all this banning of macroer business that has been in the UO news

          lately 

it make me think of some other issues.&nbsp; Why are they banning people for 

macroing?&nbsp; They say that it gives a person an unfair advantage over others 

because they are able to be in the game while others are not able to (taking 

up more bandwidth as well).&nbsp; Well I for one work for a living, therefore 

macroing is a must since I can only play a few hours a day.&nbsp; So does this 

mean that some high school kid that just got out of school and has no life 

has an unfair advantage over me?&nbsp; I'd say yes.&nbsp; If some kid can play more 

than me, thus giving him an unfair advantage should he be banned? Kinda silly 

when you think about it.<br><br>The Dev Team needs to realize that this is 

not a level playing field. There are macroers out there without an unfair 

advantage.&nbsp; If you also take in the possibility that some people hav a 40 

ping to baja, this also is an unfair advantage since most people are in the 

200 range.&nbsp; Let's face it some people are going to be better at this game 

than others, macroing or not. Some people macro and get nowhere, some people 

have 20 ping times and die all the time.&nbsp; The dev team needs to find a better 

excuse to ban people from macro, the one they have does nothing but make me 

laugh.</i></font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial"><i>I'd just like to express my opinion on the recent devlopments with 

Delusion. To Delusion, all I have to say is, shut up. I'm tired of hearing 

about Dewds, which in my year and a half of uo experiance have never seen. 

So you might be a good role-player, and you might be a Seer (I don't care) but 

you have NO RIGHT to CONSTANTLY bring down on non-roleplayers and PK's. I 

come home after work and relax, and take out frustrations by killing some 

people. The RP thing never appealed to me. However, because my name isn't 

Kyra Windsong, or Jake Ironforge, doesn't make me a Kewl D3wd...

It's people like you that take the game too seriously, act like it's your 

life, and probally spend your entire weekend glued to your screen, (hell, 

you probally quit your job JUST to play uo all day) doesn't mean you have 

to get down on people not named Antwan OrcSlayer, or Joe the Priest. Oh, and 

I love your comics, but I'm going to stop reading them, because YOU'RE TOO 

DAMNED PREACHY. </i></font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial"><i>Well take this for whats its worth.&nbsp; Its worth an individual (namely me)

          having a good experience with a GM.&nbsp; An even caring GM.&nbsp; A GM that really

          was pulled straight from EverQuest I think (judging by Ronald McDonald's

          <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/mcd/"> web site</a>). Anyway I am Stretch of Cult of the 7 Sins on the Baja shard.&nbsp; GM of&nbsp;

          that pking band we all know as Townsend (note:&nbsp; this should mean I hate GMs

          cause they are only out to ban people).&nbsp; Anyway I got turned red by a bug, did some extensive complaining, appealed to some pity,

          forfeited some rights (namely a ping on that lovely ping-pong counter) and

          became blue again.&nbsp; Basically the GM did this for a few reasons:</i></font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Arial"><i>1.&nbsp; This was in 

fact a legitimate, documented (i.e. old old) bug<br>2.&nbsp; I complained very 

loudly, and often to the queue (this should be considered a bad 

thing)<br>3.&nbsp; My large (order) guild would suffer because because of the loss of 

their beloved GM to this evil bug<br>4.&nbsp; I willingly gave up a ping on the 

ping-pong counter (now up to 3 pings, none of them willing blue pking mind 

you)<br>5.&nbsp; I nodded, agreeing attentively to the GM as he discussed the fact 

that OSI cares and loves each of us as individuals and does its best to fix 

bugs and help the community (my guild) and the individuals (me)<br><br>So 

basically as of now GMs are good, loving, caring people, who DO NOT have &quot;I can not help thee&quot; macroed to their space bar.&nbsp; (though in the 

past I did feel this was true...)</i></font><br></p>

            I'll put something else in this space. Like more information on

          PAULA! She's the psychic babe. Who sings. My step-daughter works as a

          child care worker in a fitness center and saw Paula bring her kids in

          while she worked out. It was a long way to drive (Cabot, where she was

          staying, is about 30 miles from where we live). I think she probably

          brought her kids there so that she could get some privacy and not have

          details of her every waking moment posted on the Internet or

          something. PAULA! You should buy all her records several times. I went

          to elementary school with a girl named Paulette. I don't think it was

          Paula though because, you know, the name was like different and stuff.

          Plus it was in Florida. Paulette was sweet though. I wonder what

          happened to her. Maybe she has a psychic hotline of her own, too.

          PAULA!</font></p>
