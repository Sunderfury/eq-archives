    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Origin Systems today

      announced several additions to its management team as the company moves

      forward with plans to solely create online-only games. Alan Pavlish will

      be joining the company as an executive producer. Pavlish is a 17-year industry

      veteran who comes from Interplay, where he helped create the <i>Descent</i>

      series and <i>Die by the Sword</i>, among other titles. He will begin his

      duties July 5. </font></p>

      Origin’s new director of external relations for online service. During her

      12-year career, she was the driving force behind the industry's first graphics-based

      online role-playing game at America Online and became the first product

      manager for General Electric's GEnie online service. She is also a founder

      and former executive of Engage Games Online. </font></p>

    TWISTER BACK ONLINE, OVERWEIGHT, AND USED TO BE NAMED ANAKIN</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, if you visit our Friend In

    Space you'll see that his <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">web

    site</a> is now intact, flames at Llano/Ironwill/Cigarette Smoking Man and

    all.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another correspondent, anonymous

    save for an @aol.com address, writes:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">it says in his letter

    that twister is obviously vader and it talks about the current story on drtwister

    about the guy who killed the grey thief and got a murder count well anyway,

    i looked through drtwister.com and every page relating to this situtation

    and i havent seen the name vader once, it just doesnt say vader anywhere so

    where did this guy get the name vader from or does he personally know twister

    from baja or something </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, I wasn't obsessive enough

    to go looking through his site or anything (actually I've been more amused

    by the calvacade of clipping bugs he's posting on the <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/everquest/eq-indx.html">EQ

    side</a>) but I didn't post the email out of any large expose, I posted it

    because it was funny, in a sort of our-community-is-bugfuck-insane funny sort

    of way. Frankly, I don't care WHO Twister is. Almost every week now I get

    someone emailing me saying they know who his REAL character is, and like I

    keep saying, I don't give a shit.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of exposes, our intrepid

    correspondent goes on to say</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">btw i met drtwister at

    e3 and he is really really fat. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now look, people. First off, if

    you check the pictures from Britfest, you will plainly see that the only porn

    star I will ever hope to resemble is Ron Jeremy. Sending me shocking exposes

    on &quot;drtwister is really really fat&quot; does nothing for me except make

    me wonder if he has a copy of that grapefruit and vodka diet I haven't tried

    yet. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, I know this is probably

    logical thinking on the order of brain surgery for many of you out there,

    but for many folks, especially those who aren't strung out on ritalin and

    lithium doled out by &quot;really busy&quot; teachers at elementary school,

    the lifestyle that is spending 14 hours a day at a computer keyboard (and

    sometimes more for those of us who actually work on a PC as well) does not

    lend well to a fit and trim physique. There is also the fact that the folks

    most attracted to social online experiments are usually those who failed the

    first social online experiement (aka real life) and have retreated to the

    Magical Land Of Make Believe where they can frolic amongst the posies and

    people named Galadriel.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So have fun, nuke and root and

    PK to your heart's content, but if some cute little wood elf babe in EQ starts

    telling you what a total hot lucious fantasy she is in real life, do some

    critical thinking (no, it doesn't hurt your head when you do it) and wonder

    why the hell a total hot lucious fantasy would be doing scamming virtual sex

    online. </font></p>

  <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just to let everyone

    -Bug reports are send RED <br>

    -Character logs are refreshed every 25 minutes <br>

    -In-town macroing is allowed :) (Please do not abuse this in high lag areas)

    -Enables double murder count (This allows you to give a person two murder

    counts if they have killed you and you believe they used a bug. Again DO NOT

    ABUSE THIS OPTION, use only during off GM hours) <br>

    -New bug alerts (Enabled every time you log on to a server, if a new bug has

    become known you will recieve a P-T-P page about how to protect your self.

    Although this sometimes tells you how to replicate the bug DO NOT! This will

    result in immediate termination of your Ultima Online account without refund

    of game time purchased. <br>

    -Bug abuse trackers (If someone has used a bug on you but over 25 minutes

    says that since he has a problem with the game, that not only was the GM on

    duty that night (Darwin) useless for not finding out the problem, but the

    GM that you mailed (Llano) in searching for answers is unhelpful as well,

    despite his very specific detail in what actually happened with the problem.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This leads me to one of two conclusions:

    1) you are not nearly as smart as you think because you eat the crap that

    Vader sends you or 2) you are Vader on Baja (and hence still not as smart

    as you like to to think). I am inclined to think #2, as you are rarely as

    passionate and adamant about a subject's views. Your hints in the &quot;mails&quot;

    that Vader sends are about as subtle as a jackhammer.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am not writing about the issue

    that happened in the game - Lord knows there are still numerous bugs in it.

    However you refuse to accept the the service provided by OSI, which is where

    I have a problem. OSI's customer service got to the problem, saw there was

    nothing wrong, told you that it was a result of the game's designed systems,

    received your ranting and condescending mail, replied, offered different ways

    this could have happened, told you that this would be reported, and then apologized

    for not being able to interfere and take off a murder count (note: you vehemently

    have wanted GMs to remain out of the game and never interfere). In addition,

    if you know anything about or any other software product on the market, when

    bugs like this are reported, they are isolated, tested, re-tested, tried to

    be replicated, and then fixed if found. I would bet that this happened (ever

    heard of a patch to fix something?)</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gee that's pretty shitty and

    unacceptable service for something that never happened.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When all this is said and done,

    they probably will spend about five or six total man-hours working on a bug

    that you reported that really wasn't ever a bug at all. Damn, you yourself

    question and wonder why it is that no events are run or things gets don't

    get fixed at OSI - look in the mirror, jerky. Its got a lot to do with stupid

    asses like you bitch about things in the game that you don't understand, question

    how it was ever done, rip support for not giving you what you want, and thusly

    end up hogging up more OSI resources than a Microsoft product.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's do some simple scary math.

    One Twister/Vader on each shard. One Twister-size incident each week. Five

    man-hours per Twister incident. Fourteen shards. Five x 14 = seventy man hours

    spent on issues that really aren't even issues at all by the OSI staff. That's

    almost two full-time employees' full work week dedicated to making sure that

    he is happy. I don't know about you, but I'd rather let the people over there

    work on events, quest engines, fixes, and new features.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You think you are helping UO,

    Twister? Think again. They should ban you just on the principal that you are

    costing them way more money than what you are paying.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I highly, highly suggest that

    you really look at what it is you are doing. You have a lot less vision than

    you would like to think, and are so narrow-minded that anything besides what

    you &quot;see&quot; you simply refuse to believe. I would think that the very

    fact that 99% of us in UO have had fantastic UO and UO support experiences

    should make you think otherwise, but then again maybe we all need to think

    about who we are talking to.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me recap it all if you couldn't

    comprehend what I have said...</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) You have stated that you never

    want GMs to interfere with the game. Yet despite a result of a game that was

    proven to happen for reasons other than what you think, you want them to hop

    in and give you anything you want. *hypocritical*</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) GM Llano provides quality

    support and is your GM of the Year!! Two weeks later on finding out that your

    character has no problems at all, he is an ineffective employee in customer

    support for quickly and efficiently resolving the issue. *blind by your own

    wants*</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) GM Darwin has previously provided

    good support, which you have posted before. Now Darwin is a real loser for

    going to a situation, seeing that he couldn't get involved with it, and telling

    you directly that this is a result of a game function. *ignorant*</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) You state that Llano is Iron

    Will. Um who cares both of them kick ass for me (all of them kick ass actually)

    and both have helped me and others. I don't know if he is or not (and could

    care less), but let's see how everyone likes it when they know YOUR alter

    ego Twister/Vader on Baja. *plain stupid*</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5) Your stance on PvP - while

    you would hate for PvPers to be eliminated and don't want them to be ruined,

    you couldn't stand the fact that you ruined someone else's day by MURDERING

    them, and that they subsequently reported you for a legitimate murder. *the

    pot calls the kettle black*</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the GMs, designers, OSI people,

    and guys in the UO community that have made it this far down, know now that

    your game not only kicks ass, but allows for all players to play as they want.

    You have given me and my family (yup thats right - three accounts here :))

    more hours of fun than we could ever get out of $30 spent anywhere else. We

    like it, our friends like it, and everyone we run into likes it.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Twisty/Vader - sorry dude,

    you have lost it. OSI isn't perfect, but who is in your mind - Bill Clinton?

    You hold them to a higher standard only because you are so embroiled in what

    goes on, you created a persona that only feeds your ego and blinds your vision.

    If I were you I would seriously re-evaluate what it is you are doing in game

    and out of game. Personally, I'd like you to go to Everquest just so you can

    let the rest of us have support when we actually NEED it.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you OSI for all that you

    do for us - MOST of us appreicate it. For all of you out there that are touched

    by the game, let OSI know about it thru mail, phone, chats, and posting. I

    am tired of seeing lamers make noise when 99% of us are having a grand old

    time.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  </font>

  <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A grand old thanks to those that

    work on the game and the players that make the game,</font></div>
