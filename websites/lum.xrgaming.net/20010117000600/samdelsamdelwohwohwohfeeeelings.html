        THIS SITE FOR THE PREEETY PICKCHURS</b></font></p>

      <p>Poorly lighted photographs from Britfest 99 have been scanned and posted 

        to the <a href="britfest.html">Britfest page</a>.</p>

      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><i>05/07/99 5:30 PM </i><b>LUM'S EMAIL EXPLODES, 

        YOU CAN STOP TELLING ME TWISTER PULLED THE STORY NOW</b></font></p>

      <p>Looks like Dr. TwisTer decided to unring a bell. Instead of the Delusion 

        story, we see</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>Currently Updating, please check back real soon </b></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Of course, as long as all the rants ABOUT Delusion and TwisTer are up 

        on <a href="soak.html">this site</a>, deleting the story is kind of pointless, 

        unless he wants to make the point that he erred in posting it in the first 

        place. Judging from the volume of email I got, he must have gotten slammed 

        pretty hard about it. Then again maybe they just all wrote me instead 

        of him like he asked them to? </p>

      <p>Actually, I imagine he'll probably say to hell with &quot;reporting on 

        community concerns&quot; and go back to reporting on the L33test bugz. 

        Play to your strengths, I always say.</p>

      <p>Anyway, as we all wait on needles and pinheads to find out what his Currently 

        Updating is, I recommend you read <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/9314/" target="_blank">this 

        scary young woman's site</a>. It's like mine, only with AK-47s.</p>

      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><i>05/07/99 11:00 AM </i><b><i><font color="#FF3333">NOT 

        UO </font></i><font color="#FF3333"><font color="#FFFF00">THE REALLY SCARY 

        PART IS THAT I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP</font></font></b></font></p>

      <p>A lot of you also play Magic: The Gathering, since UO and M:TG appeal 

        to the same sort of geeks with no social skills and/or lives. You will 

        find <a href="http://www.cerkit.com/mtg_legends/" target="_blank">this 

        page</a> of interest. There's a few bad aspects of living in the middle 

        of the Bible Belt, and this is one of 'em.</p>

      <p>And it isn't a joke, someone actually wrote the email he's talking about; 

        it's all over our workplace.</p>

      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><i>05/07/99 10:30 AM </i><b>DELUSIONAL TWISTERS</b></font></p>

      <p>Thanks for the emailed support. I do appreciate it, the site's not going 

        anywhere, and I'll continue to only use my inhuman Spidey-powers for good. 

      </p>

      <p>I won't post what Samwise sent word for word, but his sentiments mirror 

        mine pretty closely. Haven't heard from Delusion, don't really blame him.</p>

      <p>As for your friend in space, Dr. Twister, got this one:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><i>You remember a few months back when he was posting on his page about 

          some program (TPP) that would allow you to cast with NO DELAY.....well 

          it was true. The proggie actually existed. I have a friend who plays 

          that is/was a counselor who knew the guy who made it and had access 

          to it. He emailed twister about the fact that it did exist blah blah 

          blah.....and guess what Twisters response was..........? You give up? 

          Ok...well Twisty responded saying &quot;OMG you HAVE TO GET IT FOR ME!!! 

          I will post a message on my page saying IT WAS JUST A RUMOR and everyone 

          will forget about it..blah blah blah&quot;!</i></p>

        <p><i> Ok....wanna get even with that fucker? Hehehehe......I am sure 

          Delusion would...... I know Twisters Character name and what shard he 

          plays on......so lemme know if you are ballsy enough to post it hehehe......</i></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>No, I'm not ballsy enough to post it. Insert lines about people in glass 

        houses throwing stones, two wrongs not making right, etc. here.</p>

      <p>Here's the best take on the whole thing:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><i>Am I the only one who finds it just the SLIGHTEST bit hypocritical 

          that Twister doesn't hesitate to &quot;out&quot; Delusion as a seer and hopefully 

          make his life hell but is very careful and proud about not revealing 

          the identity of his source? I guess that's what happens when people 

          try to mix pretend journalism and sniffing glue. I doubt that given 

          Dr. T translates &quot;this skill can be easily macroed&quot; into &quot;unattended 

          macroing is okay by me!&quot; that he's capable of seeing the hypocrisy here, 

          but hey...</i></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>And this:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><i>As long as we're talking about journalistic ethics: You aren't under 

          any ethical, moral, or legal obligation to keep your sources hidden 

          unless they ask for that protection. In fact, it behooves you to ALWAYS 

          give your sources when reporting something that might be challenged 

          or dismissed as hearsay, or when passing on an opinion. If Delusion 

          was in any way under the impression his e-mail was privileged, he should 

          have made that clear -- and he's an idiot if he claims otherwise. What, 

          was he passing his little rant on for your edification? </i></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Well, yeah, actually, he was. I never made it that clear that it wasn't 

        privileged information. I have gotten many emails that I HAVEN'T posted, 

        both from within and without OSI. I do have some small amount of discretion. 

        Real small. Thiiiiiiis big -&gt; &lt;-. And I know enough journalists 

        to know that I'm not even fit to shine the shoes of a real reporter, much 

        less pretend to be one. This is just a rants page, not CNN.</p>

      <p>By the way, the letter above concludes;</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><i>I should also therefore state that I consider our conversations 

          privileged although if you do want to copy anything I'm pretty good 

          about not being an asshole about it. I would like a heads-up first though. 

          However, feel free to tell anyone you want that I'm a Seer. That should 

          fuck them up.</i></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><i>05/07/99 9:00 AM </i><b>LUM SAYS A DIRTY WORLD 

        </b></font></p>

      <p>Fuck.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html" target="_blank">Twister 

        pissed me off this morning.</a> Nothing new there, we have this sort of 

        love hate relationship anyway (he loves this site, I think his site should 

        figure out if it's good or evil instead of this schizoid half-assed UO 

        - Should - Be - More - Responsive - To - Its - Players - Oh - Wait - Here's 

        - A - New - Way - To - Fuck - Your - Fellow - Players - Up - The - Ass 

        - Sideways).</p>

      <p>But now, in his continuing quest to make the pinheads in UO support seem 

        even more screwed up then they actually are, he decided to &quot;out&quot; 

        Delusion as a seer - note, I'm assuming his anonymous informant is correct; 

        not being allowed in the Seekrit Channelz I have no way of personally 

        confirming this.</p>

      <p>However, I was told the same thing TwisTer was. The difference being, 

        I had a FUCKING CLUE and KEPT IT TO MYSELF.</p>

      <p>If Delusion IS in fact a seer, what benefit is it to the world at large 

        to know this? Oooh, a green robed freak said bad things on Lum's site. 

        Burn 'im! Burn the 'eretic! Naw, let's feed the gossip machine a little 

        more.</p>

      <p>And of course I'm sure, if Delusion is in fact a seer, he's having an 

        AWFUL good day today, for daring to actually express an opinion. And for 

        being stupid enough to send email to this page, which I was stupid enough 

        to fucking post thinking people might actually, you know, want to read 

        it and shit.</p>

      <p>Ya know, when you talk about community, you talk about people. And every 

        time you deal with people, you make choices. Those choices can be good, 

        those choices can be bad. Those choices can help, those choices can hurt.</p>

      <p>And you know what? UO may be a game, but people also exist in real life, 

        and right now, in real life, I feel like a real fucking idiot. </p>

      <p>Thanks a lot, Twisty.</p>

      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><i>05/07/99 9:00 AM </i><b>YOU'RE IN WATERWORLD 

        NOW (WANT A BEER? I MADE IT MYSELF)</b></font></p>

      <p>Been playing EQ entirely too much lately. I'd include some EQ content 

        in some of these rants since I suspect many if not most of you play both 

        games (or you just play EQ and use this site to satiate your morbid curiosity 

        about what's still hosed in UO). However, there's not a whole lot to rant 

        about in EQ. &quot;Boy, kobolds suck! I tell what, I sure am tired of 

        those large rats! Woah, those load times! Yeehaw, gotta love those large 

        rats! Hey, I found a shoe!&quot;</p>

      <p>In case you haven't seen it, Oldmanmurray.com has a <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/realnews.wc" target="_blank">pretty 

        funny everquest rant</a>, even though it has almost nothing to do with 

        everquest.</p>

      <p>EQ has potential, but right now it's only unfulfilled potential. UO is 

        a far more realized world, with a somewhat working economy and robust 

        player organizations (most of which spend more time outside UO than in). 

        EQ lets you kill small harmless creatures. </p>

      <p>In any event, my wife can't play EQ (3d engines make her literally ill 

        from vertigo) so if I want to remain married I suspect I won't be giving 

        up on UO any time soon. Besides, unattended macroing gives me a the same 

        furtive sort of thrill now I used to get from buying crack on street corners.</p>
