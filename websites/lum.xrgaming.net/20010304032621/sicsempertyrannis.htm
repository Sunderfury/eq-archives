with Gordon &quot;Tyrant&quot; Walton<br>
Vice President, Online Services and Operations, Origin Systems Inc.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="3">From OSI's company profile:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font face="Arial"><b>Gordon is a veteran of the entertainment software
  industry. He signed on as the new vice president of online services at ORIGIN
  in March 1999. He came to ORIGIN from Kesmai Corporation where he served for 3
  ½ years as Sr. VP for entertainment products and as studio general manager.
  He began his career as an independent game programmer in 1978. During the next
  17 years he worked as an executive for several entertainment software
  companies including Three-Sixty Pacific, PRISM Interactive Products, Konami of
  America, GameTek and Alliance Interactive Software. At Kesmai Walton helped
  grow the company into one of the leading developers and publishers of online
  multiplayer games.</b></font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">On the day Ultima Online 2 was announced, Mr. Walton took
time out of his busy schedule to listen to my silly questions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"> &lt;Lum> Well, you've had a busy past couple of days...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00"> &lt;Tyrant> Every day is a busy day when it comes to UO</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Let's start with the big announcement... UO2... I know you probably can't answer all of these questions</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00"> &lt;Tyrant> Good bet</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> &lt;Lum> But I will get killed if I don't ask. Literally.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF00">
&lt;Tyrant> You may get killed anyway...</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> First off, Richard Garriott said in a meeting with players once that UO characters would be ported to UO2 somehow. That still on the agenda?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I don't know when/if he said that, but no, you will not get any characters ported between the games<br>
&lt;Tyrant> Or for my patented answer, NO!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> That's more like it!<br>
Lum waits for the Battle Vortex interview so he can make Tyrant WAV files<br>
&lt;Lum> What are the major goals of UO2? Will it have the same freedom of action as UO1, or are you moving more to a structured model of play such as EQ?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I'm not prepared to talk about the design goals of UO2.  My impression from the design is that it is not EQ.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Fair enough.<br>
&lt;Lum> Do you know if there will be a PK switch, though? That's everyone's first question about the gameplay, I'd wager.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Really can't say, I'm the service guy, not the development guy.  I'm sure they will start talking about this over the coming months.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> Pretty good dodge, eh?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> OK, let's talk service :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Or lack thereof.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Hey, that's my line.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Don't expect me to be satisfied with our level of
service</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Is there a plan for a global release (aka shards outside the US)?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Of course, we will leverage our worldwide infrastructure for all our games.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Are there plans to expand to new markets with UO2, such as Australia and South Africa?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> We are working on expanding UO to new markets now, and UO2 will benefit from that expansion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> You say "no comment" well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> No comment  :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Is there a plan to expand the on-site customer service for UO2, or will you continue with the mainly volunteer model of support?<br>
&lt;Lum> By onsite I mean people at Austin - GMs etc</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> The volunteer model has been used in online games for at least 20 years.  It works (when well managed).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> There were online games 20 years ago?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Sure, ever see Plato?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Damn, I feel old now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I was playing multiplayer games there in 1977.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Yes, I remember Plato... and BBSs started around then too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I am old.  :(</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Well, let's move on to UO1, unless you have Neet Excl00sive Nooz about UO2 you care to share that I missed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I can answer some stuff about UO2 but it will focus on our service, not the game itself.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> Other than the games are quite different experiences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> With the announcement made yesterday, you've committed to continue UO1 development for at least the next 6 months.<br>
 &lt;Lum> Any plans on continuing the game beyond that? Will UO1 and UO2 coexist?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I expect UO to live a long life after UO2 is released.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> We are committed as long as we have an audience.  Most games of this type have lifespans of 10+ years.<br>
 &lt;Tyrant> Why would UO, the most successful game of this type to date be different?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> What about new shards for UO1... any plans on new shards for the US any time soon?<br>
&lt;Lum> Going by RoT schedules, in 10+ years I should finally be at GM Tactics on Siege...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> We add shards to match the usage and subscribers.  We don't have the need this minute, but as soon as there is a need we will fire one up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Can you divulge your target useage per shard in terms of number of simultaneous users?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I'm at 97 Anatomy on SP.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Woah.<br>
&lt;Lum> You got twinked, didn't you. Confess!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Not a chance.  They don't let me use the support tools.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Me either. Don't feel bad.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Only at 86 Swords/Parry/Tactics though.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Are you in a guild, or do you just run around Britain laughing that no one knows who you are?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Our simultaneous limit is currently 2,500 per shard.  No North American shard hits that limit.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> I play with one other guy (who does not know who I really am), but we have not got a guildstone yet.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> I also play on Chessy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> You know, when this comes out there's gonna be a lot of people asking each other "Who are you... REALLY"<br>
&lt;Lum> How long have you been playing UO?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I do play on other shards, but not as seriously.  I started playing in December and just passed 1,000 hours in the game.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> So are you blue or red on Siege?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I'm blue through and through.  Its a social experience.  :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Hey, I'm social! I'm just social in a different way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Meet them, kill them, loot them, eh?  :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Well, we preach the word of Mondain before killing them. It's important to get the order right.<br>
&lt;Lum> Seriously, we're not PKs, but I am red at the moment. Don't be judgemental!<br>
&lt;Lum> Anyway, do you ever make anonymous support calls?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I got gang banged Saturday before last.  :(  I make support calls almost every day.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> The staff does not know my account or characters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Cool. Who gang banged you? We'll take care of 'em.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I got caught by the "no log saved" bug so I don't know.  Playing the game is a great way to understand the player frustration level unfortunately.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> I bet. Don't move backpacks when they're on the ground, either.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Done that, don't do it now.  :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Speaking of support....</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Or lack thereof...<br>
&lt;Tyrant> :)<br>
&lt;Tyrant> I love stealing your lines btw.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Hey, I can be straight man.<br>
&lt;Lum> You've recently announced plans to hire thousands of new seers...&nbsp;<br>
&lt;Lum> Quite a few folks have emailed me with concerns about loosing them on the world with uberpowers (spawning gold, critters, etc)<br>
&lt;Lum> without any real knowledge of who they are and whether they would abuse said powers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Actually, our target is about 70 Seers, 300 Elders and 1,000 Troubadors (I'm sure I spelled that wrong)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> What limits and/or monitors will be put in place to prevent possible abuse?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> They will go through at least 10-12 hours of training under supervision.  Everything any volunteer does is logged and saved so we can investigate any alledged abuse.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> What is driving this is my mandate to Jessica to get our number of events up to 1k a week by December.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> 1,000 events a week?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Correct.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Are you counting on the seers themselves to script those?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> There will be templates, but they will have a fair about of creative freedom.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> Btw I want to say something about Jessica.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> If that is ok.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> All right, since after next week I'll be DEAD and you won't be able to say anything to me<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF00">
&lt;Tyrant> When I first started playing the game, I played for about 25 hours and had zero fun.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> So I called up my friend Jessica and got her advice on how to play the game successfully, and she got me on the right track.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> This was back in December?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I was having fun within 30 minutes.  She had played the game when it first came out and also when T2a shipped and was my "expert"<br>
&lt;Tyrant> to get me going.  Yes, December of 1998.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> So she does know the game as well as any veteran.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> So there!<br>
&lt;Tyrant> :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Well, she certainly has a confrontational style</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Yep.  She is much nicer than I'll ever be.  :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Judging from my email she is rubbing quite a few folks the wrong way. From other folks email, those are the folks that NEED to be rubbed the wrong way.<br>
&lt;Lum> Have any of those complaints filtered up to you, and if so, any comment on them?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I see plenty of that stuff, but no, we never comment on any of our customer or volunteer actions (unless it affects the entire customer base).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Fair enough.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Like system wide exploits.  But even that we try to keep mostly confidential, though the word leaks out.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> BTW, we may not make the 1k events/week, it's a goal, not a promise.  :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> It's written in stone<br>
&lt;Lum> You will hear about it now until the END OF TIME<br>
&lt;Lum> Along with Alchemy and Necromancy, of course.<br>
&lt;Lum> Back to UO2 for a second...<br>
&lt;Lum> Can you tell us who's on the Dev Team for that project? And are there any plans to open lines of communication similar to what we see in UO1?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Sure, Starr [Long,
producer] you know about.  I have to look up spellings for the other folks, one sec.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> The lead programmer and designer are Jeremy Gaffney and Damion Schubert.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> Jeremy was lead on AC when it started and Damion was a designer on M59</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Any plans on a UO2 Dev Board? I know they are just WAITING for that *heh*</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Developer Board?  Like a bbs?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> BBS, mailing list, any line of communication, really.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I'm not sure what their communication plan is, sorry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> A lot of folks feel quite passionately about shaping UO (as you may have noticed)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Me too!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> and the UO1 team has really been unique among game companies in including the players in that process.<br>
&lt;Lum> Well yeah, but you like work there and stuff.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> It's neat to work in a medium that touches people at that level, but also scary.<br>
&lt;Tyrant> Sorry, continue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> No speech, just pointing that out.<br>
&lt;Lum> Restraining orders. They work, they can work for YOU.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF00">
&lt;Tyrant> Ha!</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Well, I think we've about covered it... anything you want to say into the open mike?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> You are out of questions???  Nothing more about UO?  Buck up man!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> Well, I know Sunsword, I've talked to Sunsword, and you're not Sunsword.<br>
&lt;Lum> Of course, you're his boss, but...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I just want the players to know we care about their experience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> And ToaD. Can't forget ToaD. Or he'll wipe my character or something.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> We want the game and the game environment to be significantly better so they can spend more time having fun and less dealing with problems.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> What's your email address?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> No way am I giving out my email, I get over 300 messages a day now.  And I don't answer unsolicited email (this is for the good guessers).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> wah. Well I guess they can always email Calandryll and tell him "Send me to your boss, knave!"<br>
&lt;Lum> Note - I am not suggesting this.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> You crack me up (often).  :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> OK, one final question, then you can go find more members of the media to talk about UO2 to...<br>
&lt;Lum> How did you get the handle "Tyrant"?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> I needed a handle at Kesmai for Air Warrior, and spent about a week trying to come up with something in character.  It was either that or "The Cleaner".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> So it wasn't something you saw scribbled on your picture in the GM room?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">&lt;Tyrant> Nope, it reflects one part of my personality is all.
:)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&lt;Lum> All righty then.</font></p>
