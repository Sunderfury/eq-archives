      <p><em><font size="3">LUM THE MAD</font></em><font size="3"> is a satirical online paper published
      constantly by LUM THE MAD, inc. <br>
      <em>LUM THE MAD</em> uses invented names and products in its stories 
        except in cases where the stories intentionally parody real people and 
        products in the electronic entertainment industry. Any other similarity 
        is unintentional and purely coincidental. Well, except for when we talk
      about real people. Then we're talking about them. Unless they sue. Then
      we're not talking about them. We're just making it up. Hey, it's parody!</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">All images, logos, and screenshots are the respective 
        property of their owners. And since, as Bukharin wrote, &quot;property
      is theft&quot;, everyone who owns the graphics we stole are the real
      thieves. Don't give in to the Man.</font></p>
