<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name idiotsavant end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Tracking works like this: it lists however many mobs you can see (20 or wahtever) within your tracking range that have most recently spawned.  This is actually pretty nice when you're camping a few rares in perma, as you don't have to be constatly running around and checking each one. Can't say how great it is in big open areas, tho :/<!--ktalk end_comment-->

As a 36 ranger I can tell you that tracking becomes useless as it gets better. I can be looking right at an sg in front of me, but he won't be on tracking because its limited to 20 mob's/pc's you name it.  Since there is no filter, i will never see anything useful anymore.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

I didn't see any druids supporting shaman when we got nerfed, or any of these other classes that are whining about it now.  The Dot nerf didn't NEARLY affect druids as much as it did shaman... you still have your DD, and some AWESOME damage shields, while we just get pounded into the dirt... our pet helps, but that's after 33 levels of hell, and about 25 levels of people partying with you solely for sow :/. IMHO, druids can keep tracking... they need some serious adjustments to those insane dots they get instead :P<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Though there isn't exsactly much to nerf there.<br><br>I honestly wouldn't say the DoT nerf was harsh, though. I said it in-game, I'll say it here: It was only harsh to kiters. For everyone eles who uses DoT, it actually got better. And even if it did cut the bone of the class I call home, I can't really say that the fact they cut down on our ability to solo reds without injury is a horriable crime against druidisum.<br><br>Tracking, on the other hand?

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Mriswith end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->What I find funny is that rangers are considered a hybrid class.  Something like 75% warrior and 25% druid.  Yet they have superb tracking ability while druids can track basically what they can see (I play one :P).  I'm surprised the druids haven't been bitching about this since the beginning of time.  Way to go Verant...the DoT nerf was harsh.  Take away my tracking...well...let's just say &quot;Fuck you&quot; for you now and leave it at that.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Waco Kid end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->I'm thinking this may be in response to Ranger whining, as much as that bothers me ( as a Ranger, albeit a low level one ).<br><br>Ranger's tracking can get fairly useless in certain areas ( so I'm told ) because their is no means to &quot;thin it out&quot;, so you wind up with every snake and fire beetle within 500 feet of where you're standing.  I've heard some higher level rangers state that in some cases low level tracking can be more useful due to its focus.<br><br>I'm only 20, so this isn't from personal experience, just what I've seen rangers complain about.  Typical response to this has been to make other things weaker as a means of balance ( see the links Lum posted early last week/late 2 weeks ago about MUD nerfing ).<!--ktalk end_comment-->
