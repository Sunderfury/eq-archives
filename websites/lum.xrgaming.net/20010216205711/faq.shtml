  </font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
<p><br>
  Every so often a question will pop up, either in my mail, on the boards, or 
  elsewhere, that makes me slap my head and tell myself &quot;you know, you really 
  should have a FAQ somewhere&quot;. My co-workers are used to me doing odd things 
  such as slapping my head for no apparent reason, but it still hurts. Thus this 
  FAQ, where I try to pre-emptively answer many of the questions that you the 
  readers send in.
<p><b><font size="3">1: About Lum</font></b>
<p><i>Where did you come up with the name &quot;Lum the Mad&quot;?</i>
<p>&quot;Lum&quot; was the name of my <a href="http://mondain.xrgaming.net/">evil-high-priest</a> 
  sometime-PK all-the-time-insane character in UO. When I started the website, 
  since I was ranting about UO (neither EQ nor AC were out yet) and my character 
  was a ranting idiot in game, it seemed appropriate to use that as an alias. 
<p>When I made the UO character I stole the name &quot;Lum the Mad&quot; from 
  a 1st edition Dungeons and Dragons artifact (&quot;<a href="http://www.cthulu.org/add3.html">The 
  Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</a>&quot; or something). 
<p>The name has no connection to the character in the anime series <a href="http://lum-chan.bbox.org/">Urusei 
  Yatsura</a>; I had no idea there was an anime &quot;Lum&quot; until well after 
  I began the site. Plus, I'm male and she's female.
<p><i>Were you the Lum the Mad that PK'd me on Pacific? Did I really buy your 
  characters off of eBay?</i>
<p>I no longer play any characters in any online game named &quot;Lum the Mad&quot;. 
  I've never sold any characters on eBay.
<p><i>What do you do for a living?</i>
<p>I work for a large database company; my personal responsibilities include web 
  server consulting, web-database interface programming and other n33t0-k33n0 
  internet stuph. 
<p>Contrary to popular rumor I do not work and never have worked in the game industry.
<p><i>What online games do you play?</i>
<p>I've played both Ultima Online and Everquest on and off since they started. 
  I tried Asheron's Call but stopped due to time constraints and lack of interest. 
  I haven't decided yet whether I will be playing Shadowbane, Anarchy Online, 
  or UWO:Origin, or some combination of the above. I suspect when the next generation 
  of games comes out I will move to them since I enjoy bright and shiny things.
<p>Truthfully I spend much more time working on this website than actually playing 
  the games it covers.
<p><i>How come you never answer my email?</i>
<p>I get anywhere from 50 to 200 emails a day from this site, depending on what 
  stories are running. Unfortunately there is no chance I am ever answering that 
  much email since if I did I wouldn't have time to do other things such as work, 
  sleep and write for this site. I do read all your email, though. 
<p>If you wrote to tell me how much you enjoy the site, thank you. 
<p>If you wrote to tell me how much the site sucks, thank you.
<p>If you wrote me a long opinion essay, please post it in the forums instead 
  so others besides me can read it. 
<p>f you wrote me regarding a story idea or news that's breaking, chances are 
  I'll follow up (either through mail for more information or doing my own followup 
  work and posting it to the site). If I haven't followed up it's because I don't 
  think it's newsworthy. Sorry.
<p><i>(9/18) Did you create any websites before this one?</i> 
<p>I used to design web sites professionally, however it was long enough ago that 
  they're now all gone. I also maintained &quot;Daggerweb&quot;, the main spoiler 
  site for the incredibly ambitious/flawed <i>Daggerfall</i> CRPG. (That's gone, 
  too - the Internet is a transient place.) Before the Internet exploded all over 
  everyone I used to run a BBS which should probably count as a website. 
<p>In the UO world, before this site I created the &quot;Yew Phoenix&quot;, a 
  paper for the GL &quot;Yewbie&quot; RP community set up after the previous paper 
  closed. It eventually morphed into the &quot;Great Lakes Tribune&quot;. I eventually 
  handed it off to Allen Grey, who also eventually handed it off and went on to 
  <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/">bigger and better things</a>. 
<p><i>Did you know there's this really insulting website/flash animation/whatever 
  about you online?</i>
<p>Yes, I generally get someone &quot;helpfully informing me&quot; about these 
  sites once or twice a week. My attitude is that if someone spent that much time 
  and effort trying to insult me I must have done something right.
<p><i>Are you REALLY a fat bastard like I read about online?</i>
<p>Not that it matters in the SLIGHTEST, but yes, I used to be. I've lost a significant 
  amount of weight in the past three months, though. I think it was because I 
  took stat loss. I will also helpfully point out that unlike most of the people 
  who enjoy spreading these &quot;rumors&quot; I have no qualms about appearing 
  in public.
<p><i>God, I love you! I want to have your children! Marry me!</i>
<p>I'm already married. Happily. Really. And she has a big stick.
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Are you in charge of 
  #lummies, the IRC channel?</i> </font>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No. Contact <a href="mailto:bono@vox.org">deVoca</a> 
  if you have a problem. If you've been perma-banned, it was probably for a good 
  reason. Note: being annoyingly stupid is a good reason. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>But you were the one 
  who banned me!</i> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I probably banned you for 
  being annoyingly stupid. See above. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>But I want back in!</i> 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tough. There's about 12 
  billion IRC channels on various networks. Pick another one. </font>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(9/18) Where did you 
  and your wife meet?</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In real life. Believe it 
  or not people do occasionally get together without the aid of computers now 
  and then. She worked at a Best Buy, I stalked her and rearranged all the Windows 
  95 PCs to look like Macs (it was only 1995, so it was funny then). The rest 
  is history. Just for the record, the dialogue of my proposal follows.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;So, um, er, y'wanna 
  get married?&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sure.&quot; 
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;OK.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Kewl.&quot;</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(9/18) How long have 
  you been married?</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1996.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(9/18) Do you plan on 
  spawning?</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I refuse to believe someone 
  actually asked this question. No, human beings do not have &quot;spawn points&quot;. 
  Well, they do, but, um, this is about to totally degenerate so I'll stop.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(9/18) Which staff members 
  have you met in real life?</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of them. I attend UO

  it's not quite as sad-assed as it sounds) so I meet most of the UO folks there. 
  I met some of the UWO:Origin and Verant folks at E3. Surprisingly none of them 
  wanted to kill me, except possibly for Brad McQuaid, who ran away in fear after

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>What is LumCorp?</i> 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;LumCorp&quot; is how 
  I ironically refer sometimes to the writing collective that makes up the writers 
  of this site. <a href="http://www.vox.org/lumcorp/">LumCorp</a> is also a guild 
  that plans to be in Anarchy Online. The two are not related save that the guild 
  consists of lumthemad.net message board habitues. I do not run LumCorp the guild, 
  and probably do not run LumCorp the website writers either. </font>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(9/18) &quot;Writing 
  collective&quot;? What do you mean by that?</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I certainly don't mean we 
  all live together on a farm. Basically we cooperate on stories when it suits 
  us, write independently when it suits us, share the proceeds of the site when 
  it makes a profit, and generally do our thing. I don't see my role as Imperious 
  Leader or anything, but more of an editor and guide (and usually I don't have 
  to do either). Since my alias is at the top of the page I usually feel a bit 
  responsible about things that get posted, but in general I don't dictate what 
  can or cannot be written. Our writers can and do disagree about important issues 
  (with Myschyf and Hedron in the same group that's probably an understatement). 
  </font>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(9/18) What ever happened 
  to Great Bob?</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tyrant stole him from us, 
  the bastard. Bob &quot;Great Bob&quot; Roland now works for OSI in customer 
  service. We both decided that it would be inappropriate for him to continue 
  being part of LumCorp while at OSI due to percieved/actual conflict of interest. 
  We await the Showdown at the Austin Corral between him and Adrick with great 
  interest.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>(9/18) Why do people 
  flame Myschyf all the time?</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She's female and adult, 
  they're male and adolescent. Best answer I can come up with on the spur of the 
  moment. Another possibility is that they know she can beat them up.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="2">What did you use 
  to design the website?</font></i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What few graphics you see 
  on the site were done with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop</a>. 
  The HTML layout was designed using <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver</a>

<p><i>Where can I get the plugin for NewsPro that makes the seperate news story 
  pages?</i>
<p>The addon I started with was <a href="http://www.baily.f2s.com/cgi/dm.pl?file=http://www.baily.f2s.com/addonparadise/files/npa_hqstatic52.zip&amp;action=link">npa_hqstatic</a>. 
  I've modified it quite a bit.
<p><i>Where can I get the plugin for NewsPro that does the teasers that lead into 
  the main story?</i>
<p>You can't. It's a hack I made for NewsPro, using a defined database field.
<p><i>Where can I get the plugin for NewsPro that makes the link to a forum thread?</i>
<p>You can't. It's a defined database field for NewsPro; the updaters manually 
  create the thread and paste the URL into a form field.
<p><i>OK, so you did some hacks. Can I get THOSE?</i>
<p>No. For one thing, they suck. I'm working on a PHP-mySQL solution that mirrors 
  NewsPro's functionality. Expect it to be released as GNU open source when I'm 
  done. Don't expect it to be done any time soon. 
<p><i>God, your forums are crappy. Why did you quit using UBB?</i>
<p>Because UBB is an immense performance hog for sites that get the kind of traffic 
  that this one does.
<p><i>Well, why don't you use EZBoard then?</i>
<p>Because I don't like EZBoard. Call it Everquest-induced huge-icon-sig trauma.
<p><i>I disagree, I think the new forums rock. Can I get my own?</i>
<p>We're currently using an unreleased beta of Cyboards. When they're done you 
  can get a remotely hosted copy at <a href="http://www.cyboards.com/">Cyboards' 
  main site.</a> I don't think they will offer the new version for download.
<p><i>How did you get hosted by XRGaming?</i>
<p>I asked.
<p><i>Can I get hosted by XRGaming, too?</i>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.xrgaming.net/hosting.php3">ask</a>.
<p><i>You sellout! You have ad banners!</i>
<p>Yep. We suck. Of course, if you want the ad banners to go away, you can always 
  pay me $250 a month since that was what I was paying out of my own pocket for 
  hosting before XRGaming.
<p><i>Yeah, well, I bet you're getting rich off all those ad banners, aren't you?</i>
<p>Not quite. We're paid a certain amount per thousand &quot;ad impressions&quot; 
  (or visits). This is then split 6 ways amongst the LtM site writers. When all 
  is said and done it pays for a nice night out but isn't enough for a day job 
  (unless you live in a box or something).
<p>I also believe that being paid for your writing is important, no matter how 
  little you are paid. 
<p><i>Didn't you used to be hosted by XRGaming, but left?</i>
<p>Yes. We left XRGaming because of the problems they were having with UGO (veteran 
  visitors may remember ad banners that took five minutes to load, for example). 
  While we were in our wanderings in the wilderness, XRGaming moved off of UGO. 
  Problem solved.

  the website's content</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>What's this website about? 
  </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We comment on, satirize 
  and occasionally have non-commenting non-satirical news about the massively 
  multplayer online games world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I began the site because 
  I was fascinated by the communities behind the game - the guilds, the volunteers, 
  the class-based and skill-based associations - and how they interacted. Thus, 
  you'll see many more stories about, say, what stupid thing one guild did outside 
  the game than an analysis of some arcane game mechanics (although we occasionally 
  do that as well). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site is frequently profane, 
  often rude, many times humorous, and hopefully always interesting. We make no 
  pretensions to objectivity whatsoever and try to be as independent a voice as 
  possible.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How can you call yourself 
  a news site when you are so obviously biased for/against X?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, we never called ourselves 
  a news site, skippy. If you're looking for news sites we have this big black 
  list of links on almost every page, I'm sure you can find a &quot;news site&quot; 
  there more to your liking. We comment on the news, we don't report it. The fact 
  that sometimes the first you see of a news story is our commentary on it is 
  more a failure of those &quot;news sites&quot;, not any attempt by us to &quot;rise 
  to their level&quot;.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't you just try to 
  stir up controversy to generate hits so you make more money?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks for calling me a 
  corrupt scandalmonger. No, we don't calculate how much traffic a given &quot;scandal&quot; 
  will generate before writing about it. Believe it or not, our opinions are our 
  own and do actually exist. In any event if I were just out to make money I would 
  have made a pr0n site.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Can I submit a story 
  for your website?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We don't take unsolicited 
  stories except for very rare occasions. If you have something to write about, 
  post it on the forums and lots of folks will read and comment.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Can I become one of your 
  updaters?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No. When we need to expand 
  our writing staff, I try to pick the best writers from the community. They didn't 
  come to me and ask for the job (and most of them were mortified that I asked 
  them). I think it makes for better writers than the trap so many websites fall 
  in of &quot;Hi! I'm your new updater and I'm going to post 90 times a day about 
  crap you don't care about!&quot;. This has nothing to do with your writing ability, 
  which may be in fact quite good. Post often on these forums and other community 
  forums and when the time comes for more writers, and you're good enough, we'll 
  talk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elitist? Of course. It's 
  my site, though. Whatcha gonna do. If all else fails, make your own site. Plenty 
  do. Some of them are pretty good.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why don't you ever do 
  any stories about game X?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally we try to stay 
  with games that already have an established community. In almost every case 
  this means a game that's been released. (Shadowbane is an exception, for many 
  reasons, but mainly because its target audience feels disenfranchised from other 
  games.) While games in development often have a loudly active community trying 
  to influence its development, it's not nearly the same as the communities of 
  games that are actively running.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I heard you hated Asheron's 
  Call. What's up with that?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't hate Asheron's Call. 
  It didn't strike me as particularly interesting; however I've come to the conclusion 
  that this has more to do with me and less to do with the game. Some people just 
  don't like some games. Asheron's Call has a very active community, a large and 
  dynamic world, and a developer that listens and responds to its users. Several 
  writers for LtM do play Asheron's Call regularly now and you should expect more 
  coverage of AC as time progresses.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I heard you hated Horizons. 
  What's up with that?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't hate Horizons. I've 
  never seen Horizons (and neither has anyone else outside of Artifact Entertainment). 
  I expressed my opinion in IRC once that Horizons was vaporware that would never 
  see release. Some very vocal members of the Horizons community took offense 
  to that. *shrug* If I'm proven wrong, it won't be the first time by any stretch 
  of the imagination.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I heard you hated Everquest. 
  What's up with that?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't hate Everquest. 
  In fact at the moment it's the game I can be found in most often. I have some 
  very strong opinions about the game, as do most longtime players. You can read 
  more about them on the website, and further down this list in the Everquest 
  section.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along with the faction system, 
  my take on it is coming soon. Briefly, it's good for pvpers, and bad that OSI 
  decided to surrender to the NIMBY &quot;roleplayers&quot; (NIMBY - not in my

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Precasting&quot; was 
  the act of casting a heavy damage spell, then instead of targeting the spell, 
  readying a weapon, then timing your attack so that the first hit with a weapon 
  (usually a halberd, the hardest hitting melee weapon) and the spell hit simultaneously. 
  If done correctly this could produce a one-hit kill or close to it. Despite 
  being a bug, it was seen as one of the few ways to actually get a clean kill 
  in UO against experienced opponents by many PvP players and a test of skill 
  that should not have been removed from the game.</font></p>

  be-all end-all of MMORPGs, but it does what it does reasonably well. See <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/review/kunark/">here</a> 
  for my review of the Kunark expansion and <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/news/965350125,15768,.shtml">here</a>

<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What characters do you 
  play, on what servers?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't want to get too 
  specific since as the Hakosako incident shows there are people who dont wike 
  widdle Wum and it could affect my game play. I have characters on Veeshan, Erollisi 
  Marr, and most recently on Tallon Zek. My highest level characters are a gnome 
  necromancer, an iksar monk, and a barbarian shaman. None of these characters 
  are over 35th level.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Do you read/post on Whineplay/Flameplay/official 
  EQ board?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not on any regular basis. 
  There is far too much traffic there for any sane human to follow, for one thing. 
  For another thing, the attitude of folks both pro- and anti-Verant there has 
  convinced me that, given enough time, Everquest will actually restore your virginity.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What connection did/do 
  you have to &quot;Tweety&quot;, the guide who posted anonymous rants and was 
  banned for it?</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was in her guild on Erollisi 
  Marr and knew who she was. When she was banned a good part of our guild quit 
  EQ in disgust.</font></p>
