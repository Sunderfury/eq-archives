      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's currently an exploit 
          on Siege Perilous where by you can kill another player (or dozens of 
          other players) and not get murder counts. A particularly effective group 
          of assholes exploited this bug on myself and a good other 20+ miners 
          all weekend. If one of them had not been an idiot and actually started 
          attacking people hand to hand they still would all be blue. (3 PK's 
          1 is red and oh gee.. over 40 dead). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course the standard OSI 
          policy of dealing with bugs was quickly put into action: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1st response: page a GM: 
          no response... contact our seekrit IRC peoples and whoa! the GM left 
          half an hour early and so the shard has no GM!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2nd response: SRC (name withheld) 
          shows up. hmm is that a bug? hmmm... (goes into SRC IRC) "PQ: paladins 
          are bing used to PK and the victims cannot report thei hirelings owners 
          is this a bug?" "Answer (Zug-notsohere): nope" Counselor reply: Sorry, 
          the players not being able to be reported for murdering you is not a 
          bug even though you cannot report. The players using this are just being 
          mean... </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEXT DAY AND 25 DEAD MINERS 
          LATER (the PK's are still blue): </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3rd response GM BOBO: I have 
          to witness this take place </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4th response GM BOBO: I have 
          talked to the players in question </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(10 minutes later): 5th response 
          GM BOBO: I am talking to the players again now. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6th response GM BOBO: You 
          attacked them (I was blue, unarmed and not even in combat mode. never 
          targeted another player. 1 of the 5 of us that had died for the 10th 
          time went grey looting 670 ingots off of one of our own fallen. I PRESUME 
          this is how he was able to draw this conclusion from the mass slaughter) 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7th response GM BOBO: This 
          call has been forwarded to a counselor </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8th response GM BOBO: A counselor 
          will explain how this is not a bug. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, keep in mind these responses 
          were a progression of calls between several players over a periode of 
          about 2 hours of dying non-stop. They were not just placed to spam the 
          queue... people died and we paged again. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some friendly person with 
          OSI contacts hops in OSI IRC and talks some sense to people who.. you 
          know.. actually listen. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's OFFICIAL! It's a BUG! 
          Hey... now we are getting somewhere. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9th response: SRC shows up 
          at another group of players who are pissed off and paging. Tells them 
          &quot;This isnt a bug...&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10th response: GM shows 
          up... &quot;It's a bug.. we are aware of it and the players in question 
          are being talked to now... (the main guy who was doing this is standing 
          around still smack talking as his two lacky friends get teleported off 
          to moo moo land). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11th response: &quot;The 
          problem is resolved and players caught doing this will have murder counts 
          added retroactively.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 hours later - All 3 exploiting 
          PK'rs in question return with another batch of paladins and slaughter 
          another dozen miners - who cant report. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next day: All 3 exploiting 
          PK'rs in question, return again and slaughter another dozen players. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 hour after that: all 3

          players. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 hour after that: all 3

          players. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nobody mines there anymore... 
          nobody bothers to page GMs</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exploit? Well, I know 
          it has been your policy not to post bugs... but this one is pretty rudimentary... 
          so never the less here is how it works... my hireling (paladin) slays 
          you and your newbieness, in 2 hits you die... I go grey and loot you... 
          you never get an option to report me... </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Easily 50+ people were killed 
          on the weekend by a couple players who are still 2 blue and 1 red... 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Welcome to a different shard... 
          where things are handled 'differently' where there is so much GM coverage 
          that EVERY macro'r will get their ass busted. Welcome to an even start 
          with no major bugs and anything caught will be dealt with accordingly...

        into Tallon Zek, and (c) Verant, um, didn't think people would want to 
        play on Tallon Zek. Of course, (d) ensured with thousands of very pissed-off 
        would-be race warriors flooding the EQ chatrooms when Tallon Zek was taken 
        back down. John Smedley, Verant's President, went online to announce that 
        &quot;we had no idea it would be this popular&quot; and that a new server 
        was on order, but until then Tallon Zek would stay down.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, that sound you hear?

        British in his castle</a>, laughing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is just completely pathetic, 
        and points out one of the primary differences between Origin and Verant. 
        As much as we like to flay GMs and mock the programmers, Origin listens 
        to the community. They have people whose <b>job </b>(<a href="moibrent.html">Hi 
        Neve!</a>) is to monitor the various community web sites, to find out 
        what the UO players are concerned about and to relay those concerns to 
        the development and management teams. Verant, on the other hand, reads 
        EQ Vault once in a while. Verant <b>ignores</b> their community, and in 
        fact actively discourages it, by changing key elements in gameplay without 
        notice, specifically to &quot;neuter&quot; &quot;spoiler&quot; sites. 
        It's an ugly thing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EQ is sure pretty, but I'd 
        be very surprised if anyone that began playing EQ at its launch is still 
        playing after a year (the time Verant estimates it would take a dedicated 
        player to reach level 50). Meanwhile lots of folks are still playing UO, 
        2 years after launch. There's a real difference here, one I am busily 
        writing about (you may notice those unlinked rant titles to the left). 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But this TZ fiasco is just 
        inexcusable. Verant just displayed how completely, unutterably clueless 
        they really are. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, I put on my snoop hat

        Online</a>, called by most &quot;Wing Commander Online&quot; (OSI, however, 
        apparently has a better idea of how most folks will spend their time in 
        that universe). However, Origin has a different team working on that project; 
        speculation has it that it is now being lead by Andy Hollis, the Janes-Skunkworks 
        programmer who was just pulled off the now-cancelled <a href="http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/simidx.html#column">A-10

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tried to find some other game

        Games</a> which recently published a fairly rank X-Com fantasy knockoff, 
        but they don't seem to have any connection to Origin or EA. A closer connection 
        may be Chaosium, which issued a &quot;<a href="http://www.chaosium.com/mythos/index.shtml">Mythos

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Im part of the "l33t pks" 
          community on LS. On that shard all the movers and shakers are in total 
          disgust of the counselor program and we dont care about it much, but 
          some of us have gotten somewhat counselor respect from GMs because of 
          some reason. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About a year ago, there was 
          a rash of One-Hit weapons appearing on LS. They were mainly hvy xbows 
          and they would do over 100 dmg per hit. My guild at the time was the 
          largest PvP guild on LS and we were fighting numerous guildwars at the 
          time because this was before order/chaos wars started. So one guild 
          we were warring pulled out these hvy xbows and we were the first to 
          experiance them. Well i had a long talk with i think it was darwin or 
          ironone about it and they looked into it, and had the bows taken up 
          and destroyed. This was the main reason for the huge wep patch where 
          when you picked up the wep it would reset the dmg info to the current 
          standard. On LS they couldnt get all the weapons by just looking for 
          them so they decided hey why not patch the whole damn system. Well about 
          three weeks later i was cruising with a freind who was basically quitting 
          and he was using one of the bows as his going out party. A counselor 
          started to follow us so i paged him and asked him what was wrong. A 
          freind did the same thing. The counselor then jailed both of us and 
          left us there. He claimed we were in big trouble and i was of the opinion 
          that he had over reached with his perceived power. But during the conversation 
          he brought up that i had a huge record for exsploiting. Now this might 
          br true but i dotn know, i looted a lot of houses during the res bug 
          house loot thing, but i had thought i had never been caught. The next 
          morning i page a gm to get me out of jail and he apologized and the 
          counselor was kicked out of the program. The counselors name was Soloman 
          II, and no one has heard of him since. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what he said got me to 
          think a bit. I had tons of freinds get banned back when teh house loot 
          bug was going on but i and my freinds never got caught. All during this 
          time i used to talk to GM Carnox and Ironwill over the qeue and we always 
          had an amicable relationship i guess. Since that time i have admitted 
          openly to using UOE and have used last target in front of GMS yet nothing 
          has ever happened. And i still talk to some gms over the qeue. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now you might be wondering 
          what this all means to me and why i typed this long letter up. Well 
          this game does not require you to be part of the system to be one of 
          the elite. Ive done to much illegal stuff on UO to still be playing, 
          and i know the GMs know it. I talked to Darwin after he got banned, 
          told him i would have done teh same thing and invited him to come to 
          my shard if he ever came back. I told him id help his ass out, but what 
          i got out of that was strange. He was the GM who had bailed me outa 
          jail way back so i sorta owed him a debt, but he claimed that my account 
          had a note on it about not being touched unless i did something really 
          bad, such as duping. Some how i had gotten on the GMS favor, and im 
          still not sure how i did it. So in retrospec it has helped me tremendously, 
          I have always gotten quick support from GMS and they have always been 
          courteous with me. So i havent had to become a smurf on my shard to 
          get any sort of protection, i just got lucky i guess. This is totally 
          on the record and you can print any of it you like and use my name also, 
          but i bet my story is the same as thousands of others. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And just when you thought we 
        couldn't have any more Hell Smurf Updates, the Invisible Counselor writes 
        in with this. It's a long letter, but read it all anyway, because there 
        <i>will</i> be a test later. My comments afterward.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First off, I don't condone 
          what happened with the jailings. In fact, I think that's one command 
          we as counselors can do without. Since we are supposed to ask permission 
          to imprison before doing it anyway, there's no reason we can't get someone 
          else with more authority to do it for us. Why not just let them take 
          the blame for it instead of some lowly blue guy? Actually, since we 
          have had these commands available to us, I have not used the jail command, 
          nor do I necessarily ever feel that I will since I have more intellectual 
          ways of dealing with problem players. Nuff said about that issue.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I personally came into counseling 
          because I love what this game can do for some people. There are some 
          home-bound or closed off people who can get a great deal out of it. 
          I'm not one of those people, but I can still get the same enjoyment 
          from it. I lead a pretty normal life, I hope, but UO gives me a nice 
          diversion to take me away from that life for a few hours. I'm not the 
          secret police, though, and I refuse to be taken on that path.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do my shifts as a smurf 
          because people recognize me as someone who has the necessary knowledge 
          and knows I will not PK them as soon as I finish talking to them. In 
          fact, it saddens me when I read the macro discussions in irc. I can 
          tell that the majority of the smurfs in there don't mind macroing. We 
          just want to help answer questions, but we're powerless to do anything 
          but turn in a player if another one has reported it. I for one, will 
          not turn in a macroer if I see them unless it was reported to me from 
          someone else. About the only policing I will do is when it comes to 
          managing harassers or bigots. Those are the people I don't want in this 
          game and I will do what I can to eliminate them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Contrary to popular opinion, 
          though, the anti-macroing campaign was most likely started by some suit 
          looking at a p&l statement and figured he could save some money by limiting 
          bandwidth, not by some $10/hour GM. Personally, I feel that if MY pc 
          is connected, whether I'm there or not, then I am using the service. 
          It doesn't matter if it's me entering the keystrokes or a program entering 
          them for me. It's still my PC that's doing it and I am entitled to use 
          the service I am paying for. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enough about that, though. 
          What I really intended to write about was Counselor Crom. What Damsel 
          did was compassionate and I feel a better choice than banning. You say 
          she was abusing her authority, I, knowing Damsel, beleive she did what 
          she could to save that person's account with no malice intended toward 
          Crom. As I said before, most of us don't mind if someone macros and 
          we all think it's just plain wrong to lose an account over it. Take 
          that for what you will, but just know that our counselors are doing 
          the best we can with the tools we have. On my shard at least, we actually 
          spend our time in irc helping each other out with callers. The professionalism 
          in there is amazing. Yes, we crack jokes to lighten the mood, but when 
          someone needs help, we shut up and pay attention. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I apologize if this is a 
          bit rambling, but the vast majority of us are there because we enjoy 
          the game and not for some power trip. The image that you have seems 
          to be completely wrong. Just like any place of business, there are good 
          people and bad people. You took an event with a good intent and spun 
          it into the appearance of humiliation, when in fact it was a saving 
          act. Try to take things at face value and don't read deeper than what 
          actually happened. The main reason we have bad press is because some 
          people just won't let go of the past. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm asking you to let it 
          go and try to see the good that we do. I sometimes wish we could take 
          regular players along with us so that they can see what we actually 
          do. They'd be shocked at what we see sometimes and how well we handle 
          it. Have you ever spent an hour of your time talking to someone you 
          don't know whos account was hacked and lost a placed tower? I have. 
          We have the job of explaining that they will not likely get any recompense 
          from us since it was their computer that was hacked, not OSI's. The 
          thing is, though, we have to do it and try to make them feel better 
          and understand why we can't help them. We don't just say "You're SOL" 
          and leave. We take the needed time to talk to them and make them feel 
          better. That's why we counsel. We want to pass on what we know to others, 
          not keep it to ourselves. I truly hope you can see that. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've gone on a lot longer 
          than I intended, but I am very supportive of the current program. Page 
          a smurf sometime and I think you'll find some great people out there 
          who dedicate time to just helping out.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK, where to begin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First off, there was some controversy 
        over publishing the Crom-Damsel letter at the Lum the Mad Advisory Board 
        (consisting of me, my drink, the peanut gallery in IRC, and the occasional 
        reproving stares of my better half). In the end, I went with it, not because 
        I thought Crom needed to be banned (he didn't) or because I couldn't see 
        that the letter writer had quite a nice big grudge against SLC Damsel 
        (s/he did) or even because I just wasn't tired of bashing smurfs (I am, 
        believe me, I am). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I went with it because I pretty 
        much picked that letter at random out of the 50 or so in my email bitching 
        about SRCs/SLCs/ASRCs/SDGWPRCs. (Unfortunately, the last abbreviation 
        is the only one that I made up.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ya want my opinion? Of course 
        you do, that's why you came to this page. I've talked to quite a few smurfs 
        lately, including Papa Smurf himself (sorry, that conversation was strictly 
        off the record), and my opinion of the program hasn't changed from the 
        days when every K3wld3wd guild had a pet smurf as an invulnerable teleporting 
        scout. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Frankly, recruiting players 
        to give support and aid to other players is a mistake.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not because those players are 
        somehow evil (most aren't) or because those players abuse their powers 
        (most don't); no, it's a bit more subtle than that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No, recruiting a player support 
        system from the player base is a mistake because it fosters an atmosphere 
        of cliquish elitism, both among the &quot;rulers&quot; and the &quot;ruled&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think the best example here 
        is Siege Perilous. Here we have an expert-level shard. You have this huge 
        sign come up when you log in basically saying &quot;If you aren't a hardcore 
        expert, stay the hell out.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Guess what -- SP has Cs and 
        SRCs and SLCs and ASRCs and whatever cool abbreviations I forgot. And 
        my question is um, why?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GMs I can barely -- just <i>barely</i> 
        accept on SP, mainly because getting stuck on T2A with no way of moving 
        is a very real possibility. But smurfs? I mean, jesus, who the hell is 
        going to call a smurf for help on SP? What, &quot;Hey, Mr. Counselor, 
        I can't sell anything to these NPCs, what up wit dat?&quot; I mean, this 
        is an expert shard. With expert players. Do they <i>really</i> need a 
        hintbook?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't think so. And I think 
        Siege is getting the usual buttload of Helpful Ultima Online Monkeys because, 
        well, Siege is a cool shard. The same reason we had 10 GMs running around 
        banning macroers the first couple days it was up.. they thought it was 
        cool, too, and their own, special way, they thought they were helping.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I mentioned &quot;rulers&quot; 
        and &quot;ruled&quot; before, and the metaphor bears repeating. I can't 
        begin to count the number of emails I've gotten from Cs and SRCs, some 
        well written, some not, that made the case that C/SRCs were hard working 
        devoted servants of the people unjustly slandered by what I write. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's the same thing a Congressman 
        says when the press catches him with the intern. &quot;I'm just trying 
        to do the people's business!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm sure there's lots of folks 
        who are Cs and SRCs because they want to help people and help the game 
        that's eaten far too much of their life already, and I'm sure many, many 
        newbies have appreciated personal tutoring in the vast and bizarre complexity 
        of the Ultima Online gaming system. But ya know what? There aren't many 
        newbies on Siege.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, and this is 
        a fact that is going to be powerfully argued against by those smurfs reading 
        this, a great many Cs/SRCs get into the program because It's The Next 
        Step. You know, they got the GM Tinkers, they rocked the enemy guild in 
        PvP, they did the townwars, now it's time to get the robe and get the 
        kewl powers. And once they do that, the Next Step beyond that is to get 
        more letters in front of your name. SLC? ASRC? There's so many acronyms 
        in the support program, it makes the US miilitary look like a paragon 
        of clear speech. But those acronyms are important -- it's a tangible reward. 
        Along with that goes access to GMs (although why people would fight over 
        access to barely-street-legal glorified tech support clerks boggles my 
        mind), access to news and updates not given to everyone else... you know. 
        Access. Juice. The part and parcel of being <i>inside.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Communities foster this raging 
        elitism... I've gone on before about the &quot;Test Guild&quot; and the 
        &quot;Shardies&quot;, and this is another, more openly visible symptom 
        thereof.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But you know what pisses me 
        off, why I keep raging about all this? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not that the people themselves 
        are imperfect... the last perfect person got nailed to a cross and left 
        for the crows a couple thousand years back, and we've been pretty short 
        on perfect people since. No, what really trips my flamethrowing pineal 
        gland is that OSI, and to a much lesser, much less organized extent Verant, 
        have hit on the possibilities of exploiting that elitism for their own 
        corporate gain. Because when you have hundreds of people willing to work 
        for you for free supporting your product, why the hell would you <i>ever 
        </i> need to pay anyone?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that's why this will never 
        change, and why this is the last rant on this particular subject. Because 
        human nature, and the nature of greed, are not things that can be easily 
        fixed. Merely pointed at, for easy recognition, while we whistle in the 
        dark as we pass.</font></p>
