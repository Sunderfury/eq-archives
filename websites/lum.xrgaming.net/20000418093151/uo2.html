<p><font face="Verdana">Here we see a perfectly ordinary Lord Blackthorn on his
way to school in Magincia. (This is part of the first cutscene.) Eventually
Blackthorn becomes disenchanted with the exploitation of the peasantry that goes
on under such a feudal class-based system that Lord British perpetuates. He
leads a brave, revolutionary war against British's evil generals and warlords.<br clear="all">
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="pla2.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="206" height="131"><br>
The people fight valiantly alongside Blackthorn and his crusade to rid Britannia
of its running-dog oppressors! Fight, brave Britannians! Fight!<br clear="all">
</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="maocrowd.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="208" height="119"><font face="Verdana">Blackthorn
is elected Premiere of the People's Republic of Sosaria in a very fair and
certainly democratic election. The people celebrate!
Finally, a dictatorship of the proletariat that we can be <b>proud </b>of! As
his first edict, Blackthorn announces that macroing for skill gain is part of
the innate human rights of the people. &quot;For after all, does not power come
from the barrell of UOAssist?&quot;, Here, the Red Guards of Chaos celebrate
Blackthorn's 944th birthday.<br clear="all">

<p><img border="0" src="tradeskills.jpg" hspace="10" align="left" width="211" height="140"><font face="Verdana">Here,
in a screenshot from Yew, we can see that trade skills have indeed made the jump
to UO2.<br clear="all">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="zsu23alg.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="221" height="144">Will
there be monsters to fight in UO2? Of course there will be! Here's one, a pretty
Unicorn as envisioned by Todd McFarlane.<br clear="all">
</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="meg.gif" hspace="10" align="left" width="110" height="180"><font face="Verdana">UO2
will also allow you to play as different forms of life, including <b>award-winning
actress Meg Ryan!</b></font></p>

<img border="0" src="donaldingred55.jpg" hspace="10" align="left" width="203" height="213"><font face="Verdana">Will
there be player housing? Hell yes! But you'll have to buy it from this guy.
Sorry, but UO2 is achieving <b>new forms of realism! </b>You will just have to
adapt.<br clear="all">

<p><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="RAMBOFCB.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="95" height="134">And
finally, what Ultima would be complete without Lord British. LORD BRITISH AS
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE... HE'S OUT FOR BLOOD AND <b>TAKIN' NAMES!<br clear="all">

<p><font face="Verdana">Well, this is probably as much UO2 information as you
can stand right now. Stay tuned, when we have more of that INSIDE INFO you want
and need!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net">Return to Lum the Mad,
some of which still hopefully isn't completely disconnected from reality...</a></font></p>
