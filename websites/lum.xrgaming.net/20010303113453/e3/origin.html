  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="origin.jpg" width="204" height="250" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">Origin 
    has had a bad year. At its beginning, it released Ultima 9, a critical disaster, 
    technical nightmare and commercial disappointment, and was followed by a hemmorhage 
    of employees including its founder and symbol, Richard Garriott, a botched 
    release of an expansion to its one ongoing commercial success (<a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/review/uor/">Ultima 
    Online: Renaissance</a>), and most recently a radical change in direction 
    of the marketing of its sole title known to be in development, from a sequel 
    to Ultima Online to something that might have been constructed by a pack of 
    rabid marketing specialists eager to cram as many buzzwords on a box as possible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A rose by any other name is judged 
    by its engine. I actually got to look at UO2's engine in action. (UO2, by 
    the way, is still the name still used by the development team in casual conversation. 
    This will probably change, but I suspect using &quot;Origin&quot; in this 
    review would be a bit confusing, being also the company that develops Origin, 
    I mean UO2. We wouldn't want to actually be confused by marketing. That would 
    be counterproductive. Marketing would <b>never</b> be counterproductive!) 
    It most definitely is not the Ultima 9 engine, or anything like it. It looks 
    cleaner, it runs faster (even in its current state), and it doesn't as far 
    as I know make you actually swim to anything. We'll get that out of the way 
    right now.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I was shown UO2 in a closed door 
    presentation crammed in with <a href="http://www.wewp.com/">WEWP!</a>, <a href="http://cob.xrgaming.net/">Crossroads</a>, 
    and a few other fansites. It was a very slick, very professional production. 
    Very high production values. Very slick video. Very nice dancing. UO2 wins 
    the Battle Of The Dancing MMORPGs. Jeff &quot;Knight&quot; Anderson memorized 
    his laugh lines well. But what did the actual engine look like?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="uo2-2.jpg" width="320" height="228" align="right">Well, 
    it doesn't suck, and expectations for UO2 have been lowered to such a point 
    that this is probably what they were aiming for. The engine does a good job 
    of being graphic. It was pretty choppy, especially considering it was probably 
    running on a supercooled Cray or something, but the dev team said that was 
    due to almost no optimization having been performed on the engine yet. Clothing 
    can be dropped on characters and the meshes will deform to suit, similar to 
    what we saw in Anarchy Online. We were told (though not shown) that characters 
    can do multiple animations simultaneously (such as running and shooting a 
    bow) similar, again, to what we saw in Anarchy Online. Characters have a dizzying 
    amount of emotes and social movements available, and I bet you can probably 
    guess where else I saw them. Unlike UO, Origin actually has competition this 
    time around. Sometimes Origin seemed aware of it, and sometimes they didn't, 
    with statements like &quot;You know, we're the only ones who ever actually 
    did this before...&quot;. I guess Everquest and Asheron's Call were some other 
    genre. Maybe &quot;Games Without Unrestrained Peekays&quot;. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The demonstration, to a frustrating 
    degree, focused to the exclusion of all else on eye candy. A revolutionary 
    new skill system was touted, but not actually shown. A paradigm shift to Windows 
    user-interface-centric right clicking was described, but not actually shown. 
    Basically we saw lots of dancing, pretty scenery, and Blackthorne the Claw. 
    What we did not see was actual combat, actual skill building, player crafting, 
    or really anything else to distinguish the game from a very pretty 3D Diablo.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="uo2-3.jpg" width="320" height="228" align="left">To 
    be fair, the team was vey forthright when asked about this - &quot;it's not 
    done.&quot; UO2 is still a year away from release. What we saw looked good 
    for a game with twelve months of programming work yet to go. It was reassuring 
    to see the engine actually chugging away, especially with a 28.8k connection 
    (E3's internet connection was down intermittently throughout the show). There 
    really is a working UO2 client, Virginia, and it is capable of actually showing 
    cool things. The motion capture technology that Origin is spending kazillions 
    of dollars on (or possibly just going next door to EA Sports and saying &quot;Hey, 
    can we borrow those electrodes? We'll bring them right back&quot;) allows 
    for some very cool animations. Everyone is laughing at the dancing meerlings 
    in the demo (including me) but the truth is that no one has ever seen something 
    as simple as two people actually dancing in step in an online game before. 
    Small steps are good steps.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What we saw was really a &quot;technology 
    preview&quot;. We saw zero in the way of gameplay, although we did get a chance 
    to discuss some of it with the design team later (see below for the full interview). 
    If what they say holds true, UO2 will be far closer to a blend of the best 
    of EQ and AC than to UO, which I suppose makes the ditching of the UO2 moniker 
    even more of a good thing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some things we did find out about 
    the game system are new (well to me anyway). UO2 is a level-based game, although 
    in a fashion similar to Asheron's Call, levels are more guideposts to a person's 
    advancement level than any actual real benchmark of power. Although two zones 
    are labelled &quot;unsafe&quot; (aka PK+), the impression I got from talking 
    to Damion Schubert was that PKs would not be welcome in his game. (It was 
    probably him saying &quot;PKs will not be welcome in my game&quot; which clinched 
    the suspicion.) Expect reputation systems/penalties similar to UO in their 
    punitive impact on random PKing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The skill system used in UO2 was 
    also discussed, although more around the edges than in detail. It's obvious 
    that it is still deep in development; it's also obvious that this is really 
    the core of the game itself. Players will be able to be generalists (the &quot;Tank 
    Mage&quot;, say) or specialists (the best damned two handed axeman money can 
    buy). There is a hard level cap and a hard skill cap, and it was mentioned 
    that it would take &quot;months&quot; to get there. However, newbie levels 
    were described as quick to pass and in any event new characters would be born 
    &quot;competent&quot;.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what's my call? Too early to 
    tell. The rapid dumping of core features (housing, guilds, rideable mounts) 
    could mean a ship-by-this-date-or-else mentality that destroys every other 
    Origin product, or it could mean a new commitment to quality and not promising 
    what you're not sure you can deliver. Depends on who you talk to. At any event, 
    the game is the farthest from release of any of the upcoming MMORPGs I saw 
    at E3 (Shadowbane has a similar release date, but seemed much further along 
    in development). We probably will see another E3 before release, at which 
    time we can deliver a more reasoned judgement. Until then, <a href="ftp://ftp.owo.com/pub/uo2/UO2_ccir_90.zip">watch 
    the pretty dancers in the intro movie</a> and read these interview transcripts 
    while you download all 22 megs of it.</font></p>

    – no. [laughs] Just kidding. That videotape actually uses all the in-game 
    models and textures and motion capture that we actually have in the game. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr Long launches the 
    UO2 client]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SL: This is not actually 
    the view people will play from, this is a way-pulled back view that just gives 
    you a top view of the area we’re going to tour right now, giving you a sense 
    of persepective. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: This is us, this the 
    digital persona we’ll play in the game. We picked a bald guy because bald 
    guys are cool. [laughter] This is going to take about ten minutes, and we’re 
    just going to run through, not too many questions, we’ll take questions at 
    the end. The fiction most of you are aware of, let me breeze through that. 
    We’ve brought together three different timelines, a cataclysm in the land 
    brought together the past, the present and the future. The past is a continent, 
    the present, and the future. So there is three continents in one world. In 
    the past there’s this ancient magic, kind of Jurassic Park almost in its style 
    of look, primordial. One continent is the present, which we think will remind 
    you of classic Ultima fantasy. One continent is the future, kind of Jules 
    Verne-ian look, steampunk almost. And that’s where the Juka come from. Over 
    the past hundreds of years the races have merged and blended together, and 
    that’s the world that we are going to show you today. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr’s onscreen persona 
    appears in a small rustic-appearing town, with several people scattered about.]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right now we’re dialed 
    in over a modem, and we’re playing with people in Austin, Texas. They’ve got 
    about ten people there playing with us. There’s two of them, hanging out over 
    here, waving to us, good morning guys. And he said “Hail noble adventurer, 
    we are honored by your presence,” and Starr types back “Greetings.” Much to 
    the delight of people, we’ve added a lot of social movements to the game. 
    So if you think about how much of your day yesterday you spent killing dragons, 
    probably a small percentage of your time. And most of the time you spent was 
    talking, sitting, chatting, you’re seeing hugging, embracing, waving, actually 
    the things that make up human communication. And rather then spending all 
    of our time doing that, we’re…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[figures on screen begin 
    spastic attempts at dancing, room erupts in laughter]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately we actually 
    had Starr as the motion capture model for the dance, and this is as good as 
    it gets. We’ll try to get real talent the next time we shoot.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Audience member: Travolta 
    is cringing somewhere. [laughter]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr’s persona enters 
    a small building.]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: Yeah. So now we’re 
    going to go into the provisioner’s shop. The first mission for us is to deliver 
    on what we call the digital persona, that avatar, right? That representation 
    of you in the game, your alter-ego. So you pick your body, right, do you want 
    to be a Meer or a human or a Juka, also very important is your ability to 
    outfit yourself, to create that look that you want. Do you want to be a barber, 
    or do you want to be a barbarian. You want to be able to pick out what those 
    things look like. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[A sword and armor chestplate 
    appear on the ground behind the character.]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And here we actually have 
    a shopkeeper. He’s left some items for us on the ground, he’s not the neatest 
    guy in the world, but we’ll deal with that anyway.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr mouseclicks to 
    pick up the items on the ground and drops them on his onscreen representation. 
    They appear both on his body and on a 3D-rendered “paperdoll” similar to the 
    UO paperdoll that appears.] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We’ve got a sword there… 
    really important, unlike UO, that we’ve got a 3D avatar in this game, and 
    the paperdoll looks the same way. Equipped, you can actually move around, 
    it’s shadowed and shaded, so that when you do your moves you actually see 
    what other people see with yourself. All these pieces are pieces that can 
    be taken apart and put on in various combinations. Right now we’re wearing 
    pirate boots, and some Meer pants, and a Juka breastplate, and they can all 
    be swapped out for different pieces, giving people really an infinite amount 
    of appearances. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr’s persona walks 
    out and goes around the back of the building, where some almost photo-realistic 
    dogs and cats are lingering nearby.]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our second goal is accessibility, 
    and our first goal is to create immersion, there’s dogs and cats in the world, 
    a real high-density number of objects, trees and plants, people, you know, 
    the depth and realism has to be there. The goal is to suspend disbelief in 
    the same way that you suspend disbelief when you go into a movie theatre. 
    To feel like you’ve lost yourself in the game. The second goal for us is to 
    create a game where new players can get in without feeling like they’re overwhelmed. 
    If you’ve played Unreal Tournament, the first time you play Unreal Tournament, 
    what happens to you?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Audience member: Dog meat.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: Yeah. Second, third, 
    fourth time?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Audience member: Dog meat.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: Yeah. So now we’ve 
    been playing for about two hours and we’re still just running madly, right? 
    We have to be able to deal with that online games are hard for people. We 
    have to get them into the game, and the way we’re doing that is through safe 
    zones. So one entire continent, the Virtue continent, is now safe, that means 
    you can’t be PK’d, you can’t be pick-pocketed, and you can adventure. We’ve 
    created this space because we actually believe strongly in community and roleplaying, 
    we want to give people a free and clear opportunity to make sure that that 
    is available to them. So they can grow their character from the newest character 
    all the up to, you know, a fairly mid-level character, before they really 
    want to go out and start adventuring. If they want to leave day one, they 
    can go out and leave day one. But it creates that comfort zone for them to 
    be able to start growing a character. This also encourages a lot of unique 
    opportunities for people to do roleplaying, the trading, the crafting, and 
    all those other aspects without the fear of being PK’d. And blends into the 
    Adventurer’s Economy so that people can go out who are seasoned guys, kill 
    the dragon, come back, buy the armor from the armorer in town. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr’s persona is now 
    in a field with a unicorn and some horses]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This space, the Virtue 
    space, is going to harken to a lot of the mythology that we think of when 
    we think of classic Ultima, classic fantasy. So, let’s talk about the third 
    goal in accessibility, and that’s right-click menus. For us, some games, you 
    have to read a thick manual to try to get through, very difficult, for new 
    players and seasoned players alike, so we want to be able to do the right-click 
    menus so that when you see a door, you click on the door and it brings up 
    the most likely things you want to do. Do you want to open the door, or shut 
    the door, or lock the door. Or pick the door. Those are the kinds of options 
    that we wanted to present to people. So now we’re going to go out to Logos, 
    Logos is the second stop on the tour. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr’s persona looks 
    down at the floor. Nothing else happens.]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notice the beautiful special 
    effects! This is what we like to call the “programmer’s teleport”. Um, not 
    really. This will all be fixed when we’re done.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can walk unobstructed 
    from one end of the continent to the other, and between the continents you 
    can take moongates to get there. One more, fine. You got to do it twice. When 
    we go to Logos, you’ll notice some pretty big differences.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr’s persona appears 
    in a city full of catwalks and islands, floating in a polluted air similar 
    to the first scene of the UO2 video]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now you’ll notice we no 
    longer have trees, log cabins, or unicorns, this is in the technical land, 
    it’s actually a floating city, that floats over the land, in a polluted atmosphere. 
    It really harkens back to the themes, textures and colors that you’d expect 
    more of a Jules Verne-ian look. We don’t have lasers, no laser guns, no…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Windows error pops up 
    and is quickly minimized]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That’s our one sound bug. 
    We have to have one bug for the demo. You can see the clouds scrolling by 
    over the towers, all the lightning in the clouds, all the flares. Over here 
    is one of the guys in Austin, this is Onyx, he waves to us, as you can see 
    the moon setting in the distance, there’s actually two moons, that rotate 
    around the planet which rotates around a sun, we have stars as well but it’s 
    hard to see, because it’s kind of orange. He says “Lord Blackthorne’s beasts 
    are on display, would you care to see them?”. So sure, let’s go see them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[We are taken to a zoo-like 
    pavilion, where most of the creatures shown in concept and screenshots are 
    pawing around, one per cage.] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So the third goal we wanted 
    to deliver on, we talked about personas and accessibility, is to create an 
    amazing looking land. We want to create that with diversity, so I believe 
    it’s important to allow people to play the game, to wander and experience 
    new, fresh things that they haven’t seen. We want to get a sense of wonder 
    when people see a creature that they don’t know what it is. Clearly, that 
    is something you don’t want to play with, but there’s other things that you’re 
    not sure what they are, that’s Starr in the morning.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Laughter. Starr makes 
    a roaring, snorting noise like a wild beast.]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One thing we really believe 
    in is the mystery, you see creatures like this and you don’t know whether 
    to pet it or kill it, if it’s going to lick you or eat you, that’s part of 
    the fun. You want to have unusual looking things that you believe could exist 
    and you’re not exactly sure what they are. We kind of have the advantage of 
    being the first real second-generation game of this kind, big graphical persistent 
    world, massively multiplayer roleplaying game, and it really came into play 
    yesterday, when I don’t know if any of you heard, but all the network connections 
    in the entire floor went down, and so we’re sitting here at 9:00 pulling our 
    hair out, the little bit that we have left with tweezers, I suppose, and we’re 
    trying to figure out what we’re going to do. We actually got a modem hooked 
    up through a phone line, and we’re playing through a 28.8 right now. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr moves down to another 
    pavilion where 10-15 people are facing off in pairs doing various combat-related 
    animations.]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fourth thing is combat, 
    rather then two guys doing the same movements over and over again, we want 
    to do ten times better, twenty-two guys on screen, up to about thirty, thirty 
    five people. We’re at about a full level of detail right now, about 500 polygons 
    apiece right now. All of them have different weapons, different armor, different 
    weapon styles, pieces can be pulled off and swapped out, you can see we’re 
    wearing his breastplate, the weapons are, although, his weapon is actually 
    a chain sword, it’s got some technical feel to it, but basically a sword, 
    we’ve got serrations along the side, the goal is to create different kinds 
    of weapons, but remain true to what you’d consider a fantasy world. The styles 
    are all motion-captured, we have a variety of styles and skill trees, we’ll 
    talk about that a little in the Q&amp;A. We also do what we call multi-body 
    animations, so instead of run-stop-shoot your bow, run-stop-shoot your bow, 
    now you can run and shoot your bow simultaneously, or other things like swing 
    your sword or laugh, or wave, anything. So our friend says, “Hey, I better 
    alert Lord Blackthorne, so that he may send reinforcements.” So we’re going 
    to go out and see Blackthorne.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Starr walks out to a 
    platform where Blackthorne, looking identical to the toy shown off by McFarlane 
    Toys, claw and all, is standing alongside a few guards.]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another objective is to 
    create compelling stories and tell them with main characters, and to craft 
    that storyline out. So we built a storyline out that covers about the first 
    18 months of the game, from launch out to that period, and we’re going to 
    tell it the same way you would tell a story in a movie, with the main characters 
    being played by digital actors from Origin and elsewhere. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here’s Blackthorne, he’s 
    kind of half man, half machine. He says, “Who dares to disturb me,” and I 
    say “hey, we’re being attacked.” So the goal of this demo is to give a quick 
    snapshot of what gameplay is like when a new player comes into the game. It 
    goes from the safe Virtue lands to the more dangerous lands, goes from the 
    social experience, where you can chat and trade and roleplay, to the more 
    serious, combat side of the game, and hopefully all points in between. We’re 
    about twelve months from launching the game, about this time next year. There’s 
    a lot of work we still have to do, no particle effects are in, so we couldn’t 
    show off any of the cool spell effects, and even today, we don’t have the 
    LODs, so we have to draw everyone at 500 polygons. There’s some easy optimizations 
    for us to do still. There’s work to be done, we’ve got a lot of things we 
    still want to continue to add in. The goal overall, and I’m sure we’ll talk 
    about this too in Q&amp;A, is quality, so the objective is to make sure the 
    things we do are great. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That’s the tour! Now the 
    fun part. Any questions? No? Good? Thanks for coming!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[laughter]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shoot, Mike.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Audience member: OK, one 
    of the problems with the original Ultima was the counselor support. The counselors 
    were basically useless in the beginning. Have you guys already designed the 
    counselor powers? Will they have to be added later? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: Do you think the counselors 
    in UO are useless today?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: I am one of them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: Do you think they’re 
    useless today?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: We got the powers, 
    we got them taken away, we got nerfed, we lost them, we got some back, Most 
    of the counselors have been counselors since the game began, and we never 
    really had the tools to help players. Like, somebody falls into a hole, we 
    can’t pull them. We have to get permission from a GM to pull somebody out 
    of a hole. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Damion Schubert: The good 
    news is that Tyrant, you know, Gordon [Walton], is going to be running our 
    GM support program. Basically, Gordon is not going to let us get away with 
    releasing it half done, but we have the benefit of learning a lot of lessons 
    from UO2 in that regard. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Starr Long: Part of the 
    challenge, too, is that we have a lot of really excellent counselors. And 
    occasionally, we get some counselors who aren’t so good. And the fear is that 
    you have to be careful about what powers you give to people, because they 
    can be used for good just as they can be used for evil. Overall, the goal 
    is to have a great quality service. It’s a very careful balance that you have 
    to strike, between giving people, quality people like you, who can actually 
    help make the game a better experience, and give you power vs. someone who 
    doesn’t want to help people, and is going to make the experience worse. We 
    all, at least at Origin, have gotten a hard time about having bad counselors, 
    bad GMs, and it happens. So, you have to draw that line, and I think that 
    comes from some experience.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: I think, too, that 
    ties into an advantage that we have, that we’ve done it all once before. We 
    have a lot more experience than anyone else right now, and hopefully we can 
    fix a lot of the problems we’ve had this time around.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SL: And not reinvent the 
    wheel every time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: That will make the 
    player base really happy knowing that. When this goes live, the counselors 
    will probably already be there waiting for people, and they’ll be able to 
    help them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: That ties into the 
    stuff we’re already starting, with the beta. We’re working with the existing 
    UO playerbase for that. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SL: And our betatest, 
    we’ve talked a little bit about this on the website, but our betatest, when 
    we ramp it up, we’re going to start with the UO fans. The UO counselors. People 
    who we see as the elders in the game. Give them the opportunity to get in, 
    give us feedback, make the game great. Help you, and help us. Through that 
    process I think we’ll see a better service overall.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A (different): What do 
    you do about the text dialog, what’s great about UO is the over the head dialog…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: We’re working on solving 
    that problem. Right now, all we support is the chat window, because it offers 
    a lot of things like channels and things like that. Long distance chat as 
    well, so you can communicate with your friends no matter where they are. That’s 
    not something you can do with text over the head. But, towards the end of 
    our schedule is when we’ve scheduled time for improving graphics, things like 
    that. That would be one of those things that falls into it. It’s not a supported 
    feature right now, but we’d like to see it come in. I agree with you, I think 
    chat over the head is very cool.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: When you have dialog 
    over the head, this is better for roleplaying. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: It’s easy to associate 
    who’s saying what. It’s easier than having to match names to a list of people 
    on a screen.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: Back to counseling. 
    Do they have a fictional reason to appear in the world? In UO, every time 
    they show up, they are like a pink elephant. They have no fictional reason 
    to exist in the world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: That’s a great point, 
    and we’re very committed to fictional support for the entire game, we’ve got 
    a full-time writer, Aaron D’Orive, and he is very committed to make sure everything 
    fits in this game. He’s not even our writer, we call him the Minister of Fiction. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: So the honest answer 
    is, I don’t think we’ve thought about it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: But now that you brought 
    it up, we’ll do it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: Nobody writes their 
    admin into the story.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: You’re absolutely 
    right, it’s a great idea. We’ll bring it up to Aaron and try and see what 
    happens. Amazingly enough, we don’t have all the answers. [laughter]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: What can you tell 
    us about the skill system? What kind of skills are you going to be using, 
    you mentioned skill trees, how would they be implemented? Can you show a demonstration 
    in the client?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Skill trees are going 
    to be like Civilization skill trees where each box in the skill tree is going 
    to cost a certain number of skill points. You earn points as you gain experience 
    throughout the game. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: What kind of feedback 
    do you get for that?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: I don’t know, you 
    will know, definitely…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: Well, you level up.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: It tells you onscreen 
    then? Can you demonstrate that, is that implemented yet?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Not yet, not yet. 
    We’ve actually had our QA department test the skill trees for the past six 
    to nine months.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Is there a hard cap 
    to what you can achieve with a character in terms of skills?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: There will be at launch. 
    We’re going to put a cap on at 50<sup>th</sup> level. Basically we’re going 
    to see how fast people get to that…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: So this is going 
    to be a level-based game, then?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: Yes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SL: But not constant. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: In UO2, levels are 
    almost meaningless, actually, because everything your character is, is built 
    through the skill trees. You learn stuff at the lowest levels very very quickly, 
    so that you can achieve competence quickly. But in order to be the grandmaster 
    of everything and get the absolute coolest stuff, to get that final +1 or 
    +2, that’s the stuff that’s going to take you months. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SL: It really gives people 
    a chance to have different playstyles. You can go down a lot of different 
    branches in the skill tree, and get what we kind of think as a liberal arts 
    degree, a jack of all trades. Or, you can really try to specialize down one 
    particular skill tree. You can go down to the end of that branch and there 
    are a lot more skill trees yet again. Really getting to a representation of 
    what the character wants to be. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This really goes to the 
    concept of avatars. We want people to feel that they make themselves, visually, 
    what they wear, and the kind of skills that they want to have. So that if 
    you wanted to have a two handed axe guy, you could have a really, clearly 
    differentiated two handed axe guy. And that also ties into the movement that 
    you’ll see in the game, too. The high level guys, when you level up and your 
    skills are sometimes weapon styles, such as a single bladed axe or a double 
    bladed axe, and then you have different moves that you can perform, such as 
    a hack or a slice and things. And you see that in the game. He’s bad, right? 
    The moves he’s doing, the armor he’s wearing…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: The motion captures 
    you showed off in the demo reel were just spectacular. Are those things that 
    would be opened up with different skills, like if you were a blademaster, 
    you would start doing insane moves with it?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: It’s really important 
    to me that the first time you go in, you’re confident with a sword. Which 
    is to say that you’re capable of killing something bigger than a giant rat. 
    When you swing a sword you look good doing it. But I also want you to be able 
    to go down the road and just be blown away by what that guy does.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: How are you going 
    to handle death?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Death is basically 
    going to punish someone who dies a lot. Our current model is that if you die 
    once a day, then you sort of teleport nearby. And you have pretty much no 
    penalty. If you die a lot, you’re probably trying to do something you shouldn’t 
    be. The penalty for that accumulates the more times you die. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: What is the penalty?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Basically it’s sort 
    of an experience, I use it for lack of a better word, it sort of slows down 
    your experience gain for a little while.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JA: OK, we need to wrap 
    up now, someone else is waiting. Thank you!</font></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Later 
    that night, we take you now to dinner, drinks, and pointed questions with 
    Damion “Ubiq” Schubert, Lead Designer and Jeremy “Gaffer” Gaffney, Lead Programmer, 
    already in progress.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Damion Schubert: …roleplaying 
    in PvP is one thing, going out and slaughtering everything in sight is another. 
    And people who want to kill without consequences, they will have to settle 
    for </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cassandra: OK, here’s 
    a tape recorder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: I hate you. I hate 
    you.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cassandra: Why?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Because mine’s in 
    the car.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cassandra: Well, here, 
    it’s on and rolling.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jeremy Gaffney: Anything 
    you’d like to state for the record now?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: MY FEET HURT! OK. 
    You said you’re not sure guilds will be there for launch. But what sort of 
    community-building features will?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: So the primary tools 
    for adventuring and building is the philosophy behind the game, the skill 
    set for the game. Our philosophy is to build something we call the Adventurous 
    Economy. The Adventurous Economy is one where adventurers require craftsmen 
    to supply, craftsmen require adventurers to assist. By building a symbiotic 
    relationship we can actually make our craftsmen something to be valued, instead 
    of something to be hunted down and exterminated. Want me to go into more details 
    on this? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Please, I’m still 
    trying to understand it myself. The game system itself will encourage the 
    protection of merchants?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: The game system itself 
    makes merchants consistently valuable to the adventurer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: How is that?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Mostly by allowing 
    craftsmen to enchant weapons. Craftsmen will be able to produce things that 
    adventurers cannot buy from stores or find on monsters. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: What will prevent 
    unscrupulous players from deciding it is easier to kill that craftsman for 
    the stock he’s carrying around then paying money for it?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Generally if you kill 
    a craftsman you won’t get much besides ingots. Craftsmen would make their 
    goods on the spot for a buyer. Also, most craftsmen would probably hang out 
    in the safe zone. Let’s say there’s something in the PvP lands that they need, 
    then they will hire adventurers, the other half of the adventurous economy, 
    to go bring it to them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Could a player conceivably 
    exist in the safe zone for his entire career?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: He could. Some of 
    our more advanced features will probably be in the unsafe zones. They will 
    be safe enough because of the other player killing protection features that 
    we’re going to put in. So they should be able to make an excursion if they 
    have a couple of friends to keep an eye on them. We really are about making 
    a good, fun playerkilling, player vs player environment, and part of that 
    is letting people edge out to the edge of the nest, without flinging them 
    out before they are ready. Part of the reason why UO at its launch was, frankly, 
    a horrible experience, was that you had these hundreds of people, this meat, 
    running into the meat grinder, and these people taking advantage of it. We’ve 
    reduced the population of the people that can be playerkilled to the people 
    who are ready for it. Hopefully all of the bad playerkillers will get bored 
    and go play something else. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: The grief PK.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Yeah. I want them 
    to go join my competitors. [laughs] I get probably a mail a day from someone 
    who says to them the best part of the game is the rush they can provide some 
    miner when they go and they chase and try to kill him. And you know, my gut 
    reaction, right here, is I don’t really want you in my game. Go somewhere 
    else.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: What is your rationale 
    for not being able to launch without even the most basic guildchat, given 
    how important it would be to the community?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: That’s something that 
    needs to be broadcast to all servers across a given shard. That’s a level 
    of complexity above…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: But you are going 
    to have global chat channels already.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Global chat doesn’t 
    really include the other things that we want to do with guilds, such as alliances, 
    actually designing instructions, etc. We will have channels. You will be able 
    to chat with people across boundaries, that shouldn’t be a problem. This is 
    one of those things, I wrote that letter, that you all laughed at, because 
    it was all rah-rah, but as a designer, I believe in doing things right. And 
    I would rather that we do guilds better than anyone else has done them, which 
    to be honest, right now isn’t that hard. Everquest has guilds, and Asheron’s 
    Call has allegiances, which are really quite cool. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: What sort of issues 
    did you come across with player housing that caused you to postpone implementing 
    it?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Friends list, bandwidth, 
    ability to lock down, ability to decorate in a 3D environment, to build them, 
    the ability to transfer them securely, and then there’s just exploit-proofing 
    the hell out of them. Because invading someone’s house is actually as close 
    to invading’s someone’s personal privacy as you can get in a game. It is more 
    horrific to our players than being playerkilled. So when houses go in, they 
    will be as exploit proof as we can make them. I’m sure we’ll miss something. 
    I’m sure you’ll rant at me about it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jeremy Gaffney: Did you 
    ever notice that Designer Dragon always had everyone yelling at him about 
    everything, whether it was his fault or not?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: That’s true. But quite 
    seriously. We could put in a half-assed guild system, you can name your guild 
    and you can send messages, and the players will say “Cool! Guilds!” and the 
    marketing department will say “Cool! Bullet points on the back of the box!” 
    but you can’t screw around with housing. You can’t do it halfway. I would 
    get destroyed, pilloried on the chat boards, and we would spend twice as much 
    on GMs taking calls about people getting resurrected inside houses and all 
    the other weird crap people do to exploit bugs. So would you rather it not 
    go in, or that it go in and be broken? Essentially we need to build trust 
    with the customers. It has to be done right. All the art for the houses is 
    already done, most of the areas for the houses are already being zoned out, 
    but the big thing is simply the programmer time that it takes to implement 
    it, and actually get all these different systems working, and that is spitting 
    distance, but still outside. It’s close, don’t worry about it, I just can’t 
    promise it, I am not going to promise anything I can’t deliver because that 
    would be wrong. Don’t laugh. No laughing!<br>
    <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Let’s talk about 
    rogues for a second…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Did Brad put you up 
    to this?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Huh?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: They are group unfriendly, 
    they are impossible to group, everything they take comes out of the party’s 
    loot pool…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Been done. [laughter] 
    Are they going to be able to steal stuff?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Yes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cassandra: Are they going 
    to be able to stuff their heads in your backpack and rummage around and get 
    what they want?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: If they are really 
    really really good.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cassandra: So how do you 
    just stick your hand in someone’s pack and rummage around without their knowing 
    and…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: So how do you summon 
    thunderstorms from the heavens or do super kungfu moves and teleport while 
    flying ten feet through the air? This is a fantasy game. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cassandra: That is fantasy, 
    but things like thieving are basic reality. If you’re going to be a pickpocket 
    and have pickpocket abilities, when you pick someone’s pocket you take what 
    you get. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: OK, there was a thread 
    on your site, the most fun you ever had in UO. And the first ten entries were 
    these weird exploits.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: That thread made 
    me want to throw up.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: I know.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Threads like that 
    tell me I need to take the forum down.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: So what’s the most 
    fun you ever had in UO?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Very early in the 
    game, I was just learning how to work a vendor. Vendors were just going into 
    the game and I was building up my little merchant empire. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: Selling shovels.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Yeah. Wealth through 
    shovel sales. Building up stock, branch offices, underselling my neighbors, 
    simulating being a greedy little capitalist, all the things I should be doing 
    in real life instead and getting rich. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: You mean the actually 
    encouraged proper real-world behavior and reinforced it? Unbelievable! And 
    without exploits!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Oh, and standing 
    on random street corners yelling weird crap at people as they pass. “You must 
    be saved from the angry weasel horde!” People would think I was a quest figure 
    or something. Of course, I do that on the web now, so…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: Of all the things 
    Raph has done right and wrong, I think the largest thing he ever failed at 
    was convincing players that the most fun, the most successful, the most innovative 
    coolest, weirdest stuff in the game is the stuff the players come up with 
    themselves. The players live there, they work there, they have weird goofy 
    ideas. You know, we’ve got writers, and the players will either play along 
    with the story or run amuck with it. That’s true for every RPG. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Back to rogues…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: We left the subject?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Jeremy tried very 
    hard to change the subject…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: And I was very successful!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: But I have a memory.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: UO2 is a social game. 
    Every time I have to make a decision between social or antisocial, I always 
    choose the social game. I have no problem with you playing alone. Playing 
    alone is fine. You want to go have a world of fun all by yourself, I’m not 
    stopping you.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: And I’m not touching 
    that line.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: So my implementation 
    of rogues is, yes, they will be somewhat antisocial, but I’m going to be more 
    concerned with how they will tie into the adventuring rogue, as well as the 
    faction system and other things that we have. That’s what I care about, and 
    as opposed to me just screwing your character around because I can. That’s 
    not good gameplay.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: So you’re not going 
    to have scam artists or…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: People want to be 
    that kind of thief, they will do that outside of the game system in general. 
    I’m telling you the philosophy that we’ll launch with, we may screw up, we’ll 
    fix what we can, people will scream nerfing, yah yah yah, I’ll hang myself 
    from the garage. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Player vendors in 
    UO, I already told you why they are near and dear to my heart. Are they going 
    to make it to UO2?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: That would be part 
    of player housing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: That’s connected to 
    player housing. If we can do it well, we’ll do it, if we can’t, then we won’t.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: We don’t want them 
    to be an exploit of the system. We want to make sure that these vendors can 
    buy stuff and create quests and whatnot, that’s part of the vendor system 
    that really needs to be there. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Making that exploit-proof 
    – you think that’s a simple problem until you draw it out on the board.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aureus: OK, so Gordon 
    has said that scamming people is an exploit, and Jeff Anderson has said that 
    scamming people is OK as long as it’s done within the game system.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: So, Gordon runs Live, 
    and Jeff runs development, so it will be perfectly allowable to scam people 
    during beta.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Laughter]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Gordon probably wins 
    there. OK, let me put it this way. You’ve actually read about my first experience 
    in UO, right? It made some list of  “Damion’s quotes” that scared the crap 
    out of me, I thought, oh my God, I can never say anything again. So here I 
    am, drunk and talking to Lum. [laughter] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: With a tape recorder, 
    yet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Even better. So my 
    first experience in UO, me and my friend got bored of killing chickens within 
    about 30 minutes, and we said, OK, so what can we do, so, we walked up to 
    people and said, “Hey! We’re going to lead you to the unicorn!” And all these 
    people said, “There’s no unicorn in UO!” And they followed us anyway! And 
    we’d just go and lead them out of town – we didn’t even do anything, we’d 
    just lead them offscreen. So, I was born in a realm of screwing with people’s 
    minds. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aureus: Are you saying 
    this is finally how we ended up at this restaurant tonight?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: “There’s a unicorn 
    up in northern LA!”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: “Keep on going! It’s 
    up on the 405!”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: So the answer to your 
    question is, it’s up to the dev team to one at a time stamp out all the obvious 
    exploits that are possible, such as “give me your axe and I’ll enchant it”. 
    That being said, no matter how deep we make these systems, the stainless steel 
    rats will still find a way to work their way through them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: So is preying on 
    the idiocy of others going to be bannable?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: You’re going to have 
    to ask Gordon, I wouldn’t risk it if I were you.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Another question. 
    Let’s get away from idiots and move to a whole new realm of idiocy: politics.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Now that’s a very 
    near and dear one to me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Myself as well. Now 
    how much power are you going to give players in the world? In terms of political 
    power? How much influence will they have on the environment, on the interaction 
    between the three races?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Basically what we 
    will do, is we will ship with a relatively UO level of power, except that 
    Aaron is working on a backstory that’s driven, and we’re working on ways to 
    shift the things going on throughout the stuff, so players actually have an 
    effect on the story that’s going on. My goal is sometime after ship to actually 
    implement some sort of faction system, we already have a plan for it, that 
    will give more ownership to players. But truth be told, I’m not really ready 
    to give that at ship to players anyway, because we’ve got to make sure that 
    everything else is unexploitable, and the faction system depends on so much 
    of that stuff.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: The faction system 
    you’re referring to, how similar is that to what we’re seeing come out of 
    UO?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: The funny thing is, 
    we didn’t even know they were working on a faction system…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: I find it odd that 
    you’re using that terminology.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: We at first called 
    it the political game, but now everyone calls it the faction system so I kind 
    of picked up on it. Derek [Windfeather], the guy at the other end of the table, 
    he’s already designed a faction system. It’s similar in some ways to his, 
    it’s similar in some ways to what you’ve done, what you posted on your web 
    site. In some ways we’ve got some of our own zany ideas about player interactions. 
    And it’ll continue to be tweaked as we get closer and closer to ship. It’s 
    very focused on the guild unit as a whole, because it’s easier to work with 
    guild units as opposed to individuals. But this will happen post-ship, not 
    before.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: Back to PvP. Could 
    someone actually maintain a successful career doing nothing but PvP? No monster 
    bashing, just other players?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: Monster bashing will 
    be necessary. I’m not allowing you to advance by playerkilling. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JG: Unless it’s zero-sum. 
    I kill you, you lose as much XP as I gain. Otherwise me and my buddy sit there 
    and kill each other all day. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: You will have to gain 
    experience in some other fashion than killing people. Monster bashing is an 
    excellent way to do this but not the only way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: So what is the thing 
    you’re proudest of in UO2?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DS: The skill trees. Skill 
    trees are far cooler than anyone outside our building really suspects. </font></p>
