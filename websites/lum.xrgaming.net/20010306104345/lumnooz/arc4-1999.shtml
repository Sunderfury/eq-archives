      <p>Since I quit treating LadyMOI as a human being and made cruel nicknames         that quickly circulated through the Net, the Ministry of Information updates         have ground to a screeching halt. (Well, I never got any actual <i>news</i>         updates, nor would I want any since that would imply I would have to be         like, responsible and report them and stuff. But I'm on a roll, so shaddap.)         So I found on Stratics that owo.com updated their site (no one reads owo.com         unless prompted, no matter HOW often it's updated. It's just the law.)         and has a line that could possibly be related to some recent controversy...</p>      <blockquote>         <p>Things you could be banned for include, but are not limited to: </p>      </blockquote>      <ul>        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remaining in a           guild that actively engages in violations of the Terms of Service Agreement           or the Rules of Conduct </font>           <p>This last point may be perceived as somewhat harsh, but it is clearly             stated in the Rules of Conduct that you may not organize any guilds             or groups that are based on, or espouse, any racist, sexist, anti-religious,             anti-ethnic, anti-gay, or other hate-mongering philosophy. By remaining             in a group that engages in this type of activity, you subject yourself             to the possibility of a group punishment. </p>        </li>      </ul>      <p>So, um, don't be in a guild with bad stupid or politically incorrect         people or you might be banned. Also, I'm kind of wondering where &quot;A$$rapInG&quot;         falls under... it's not racist or sexist, and doesn't address any particular         ethnic group. I guess it could be considered hate mongering, but some         people LIKE... um, I'm going to go throw up now.</p><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem925887600,88893,"></a>

Basically LB plans to,   once Ultima: Ascenscion is released, redo the older Ultimas using the Ascenscion   engine. He'd also like to take the opportunity, a la George Lucas, to rework   much of the earlier ones since it was pretty hard to cram actual plot and characterization   into an Atari 400. I asked why OSI didn't just port the tile-based Ultimas (1   through 5) to a more Windows 95-friendly engine, since that would seem to be   the quickest way to preserve the older titles. LB agreed that it would be easy,   but the problem was no one save us terminal Ultima geeks would actually pay   money for them (after all, <a href="http://www.powerup.com.au/%7Emfleming/ultima/u4download.html" target="_blank">OSI   gives Ultima 4 out for free</a>). This does go against Origin's announced intentions   to only do online games (which was reinforced in his talk), so unless they're   planning on releasing a massively multiplayer Ultima: Pagan, we're probably   out of luck for the forseeable future.</p><p>Lord British said that Wing Commander Online (or Privateer Online, which I'm   sure is what it will turn into anyway) was an on again off again project that   was currently off again, but is their number 2 priority (number 1 presumably   being that last single player game they're shoving out the door currently). </p><p>Every attendee got an Official UO knicknack (a UO zipper thingy that hangs   onto your zipper or something).

We had all heard a   vicious rumor that some dude who styled himself Lord British was going to show   up, so of course we had to go laugh at him. After an hour of warming up (which   consisted of drinking tequila and muttering &quot;yeah, I can take 'em&quot;   to ourselves in an apparently lesbian bar) we were all shepherded upstairs and   proceeded to sit at tables and stare sullenly at the pale-faced geeks who were   staring sullenly at the pale-faced geeks across from them. </p><p align="left">Richard Garriot and entourage showed up (note: not in frilly cuffs),   and after a bit he sat at our table. I figured I'd be cool and be, like, undercover   (plus I really didn't have a whole lot to say since I was busily struggling   with my low alcohol tolerance), which lasted all of three seconds...</p><blockquote>   <p>Sir Fragmor: <i>So, Richard, have you ever read &quot;<a href="soak.html" target="_blank">The     Rantings of Lum the Mad</a>&quot;? </i></p>  <p>Lord British: <i>Actually I was warned about him...</i></p>  <p>Sir Fragmor: <i>That's him, right there.

Basically, the   next set of enhancements will be designed to make the game more accessible to   newbies. This includes newbie training areas in game (such as a newbie dungeon),   developing an automated quest engine that one or two people can use for quests,   and a greatly expanded offline component, similar to the current demo on the   T2A CD. Also in the far future are enhancements to the game engine for advanced   users, including a plugin to allow for a 3D view of the world and eventually   UO2, which you will somehow be able to move your current UO characters to.</p><p>We were all pretty impressed with LB; he seemed a great deal like a &quot;cool   boss&quot;... someone who has kind of a vague idea of where he wants the company   to go, but actually delegates the details to the people responsible for implementing   it. Any questions about UO's specifics he almost always referred to Designer   Dragon or Dupre (Rich Vogel, the UO project leader). Plus, he really wasn't   that much of a gimp, so it was hard to make fun of him. </p><p>After all, despite being the object of scorn and hatred for UO players everywhere,   he actually had the cojones to <b>meet</b> those players, as opposed to the   &quot;Sullen GM Table&quot; where about 8 GMs, all in various stages of body   piercing, none of which were old enough to order drinks legally, stared morosely   at each other, radiating waves of &quot;they-told-me-to-be-here-they-didn't-tell-me-to-like-it-goddamit&quot;.   Every so often we pointed and laughed at the sullen-GM-table and made them feel   even more uncomfortable. It was our job, after all.</p><p align="center"><img src="/britfest-pics/gm1.jpg" width="425" height="152"><br>  <font size="2">The GM table, without adult supervision.</font><br></p><p align="center"><img src="britfest-pics/gm2.jpg" width="425" height="163"><br>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;So tell me,   who is this Senith chap?&quot;</font><br></p><p>Soon there was a Q&amp;A session between the assembled players and the dev   team. Here's the notes I tried to take (my PDA didn't work well in the darkness,   so many of my notes read &quot;dd said pxyl1$achg2.,qe as well as boards&quot;):</p><ul>  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In game email is coming.     God only knows why since every player is assumed to have out-of-game email,     but it is.</font></li>  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Good and evil is on the     back burner since no one can agree on what &quot;evil&quot; is and whether     or not &quot;evil&quot; should be a synonym for &quot;PK&quot;. Eventually     there will be much discussion between all the players, and after its apparent     that they won't even be able to agree on how to spell &quot;evil&quot;, the     dev team will do something.</font></li>  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Customizable vendors     (names, clothing, hair style, sexual preference) were requested and put &quot;on     the list.&quot; Murmandamus asked to see the list.</font></li>  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was asked if the dev     team had seen Coral's <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/%7Ecoral_of_minoc/supersite/Quest/questmain.htm" target="_blank">quest     engine proposal</a>. They said that they had but thought that it would be     too &quot;human intensive&quot;. They were working on a dynamic, automated     quest system as part of the forthcoming newbiefication of UO (see above).</font></li>  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A GM asked an obviously     prompted question - &quot;When are players going to be able to filter snow     in UO?&quot; Many players laughed in unison and said that it <a href="http://www.tugsoft.com/UOAssist/Help/common_page.htm">already     WAS filtered in UOA</a>. The dev team of course ignored this and said that     it was on the list, along with Arm/Disarm and Last Target and, well, anything     else that they could think of that would put Tug out of bidness. Someone else     asked that since Origin seemed hellbent on putting Tug out of bidness anyway,     why not just buy him out and save months of reverse engineering time. Rich     Vogel then proceeded to wax eloquent on how, and I am paraphrasing here as     little as possible, only the OSI dev team knew the source code well and how     the source code worked, and they really only had confidence in their own programmers,     and, well, they just didn't trust the quality of any third party code. In     heaven, Jesus wept.</font></li>  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The inevitable Unattended     Macroing question came up. The dev team said that unattended macroing was     bad because it created an unfair advantage against those, like Rich Vogel,     who tried to play the game the way it was MEANT to be played, dammit. Someone     from the GM table yelled &quot;and it wastes bandwidth&quot;. Lum said a dirty     word under his breath. Lum asked DD that, if the problem with macroing was     that it threw the skill curve out of whack, wouldn't the simpler solution     be to just remove the effect of global skill use out of the equation? (aka     not checking to see how many blacksmiths are macroing blacksmithy and factoring     that into the skill gain rate for blacksmithing.) DD said No. Lum whined Why     not? DD said because three day shake and bake PKs would become three minute     shake and bake PKs. Lum muttered another dirty word under his breath.</font></li>  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone asked if T2A     was ever going to be open for housing. DD said that instead a real estate     economy was going to be implemented because the world was, you know, full.     So instead of building new houses players would have to sell their old ones.     House maintenance will probably go in some day to encourage you pinheads to     sell those 30 houses you're holding on to on your spare accounts.</font></li>  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone asked if forges     would ever be allowed on boats. DD said no, since boats were being used too     much as houses anyway, and there were some changes in store for boats to discourage     this.</font></li>  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone asked if the     server lines had been changed. Faceless was surprised that Stratics hadn't     already reverse engineered the new server line locations, and said that the     Stratics guys could just email him to find out where they were, which would     probably be quicker.</font></li></ul><p>Richard Garriot then gave a short speech which basically sketched out UO's   long term future as a VR sort of Amway, where if you got enough &quot;points&quot;   you could have OSI fly you out to Austin and digitize your spirit and send it   into the Matrix where you could duel to the death with the Men in Black and   hang with Keanu Reeves, who knows kung fu. </p><p>Afterwards, it developed that the dev team all read this page and are great   fans and in fact will probably link to it from owo.com just to spite me and   make me look like I sold out to the Man. (Lum says another dirty word.) </p><p>And they asked, along with everyone else, when I was going to ask Lord British   THE QUESTION. The question I had threatened to ask for, god, weeks now, and   held in dark secrecy. That question, as I had planned it, was this.</p><blockquote>   <p><i>Mr. Garriot, I work on a UO related website, and as research for that     I came upon <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/thesite/0797w4/play/play733jump2_072497.html" target="_blank">an     interview you gave</a> for the Site, a web-related TV show on MSNBC, where     you said that the key to a successful online game was the ability for the     players to feel as if they mattered, by involving them in a greater plot,     and key to that would be the regular appearance of you as Lord British and     Starr Long as Lord Blackthorne, interacting with the world and its players     on a regular basis. My question is -- what happened?</i></p></blockquote><p>Sounds noble and coherent and to the point, no? Well, as mentioned before,   I had basically turned into a drunken gimp that day, and my QUESTION turned   into:</p><blockquote>   <p><i>Um, er, how come you're never online?</i></p></blockquote><p>The answer.. well, here it is.</p><blockquote>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: I'm online as Lord     British once a week.</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: You ARE? (goggles)</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: Yes, but you know,     I'm just one person, out of a hundred thousand players, and word doesn't usually     get out when I'm there.</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: But... but people     have ICQ, and IRC... and...</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: Not everyone has ICQ     or IRC. </font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: So what do you do     when you're on?</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: I'm usually led by     GMs to player establishments, to place plaques and give speeches and the like.     Sometimes I like to go on adventures with players, and occasionally I'll take     a GM call...</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: You TAKE GM CALLS?</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: Yes, it's very instructive.     I try to do it once a month or so.</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: What GM are you?</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: I show up as GM Lord     British.</font></p>  <p>Murmandamus: So, is there any chance that &quot;invulnerable&quot; tag over     your head will go away?</p>  <p>LB: (backs away) Well, there's always the chance that a mistake will happen     and someone will accidentally clear the flag... um, I have to go.</p></blockquote><p align="left">So there you have it. If you macro unattended, LORD BRITISH WILL   BAN THEE!</p><p align="left">It was an interesting weekend overall. Texas is very big and I   drove through most of it at high speeds.
