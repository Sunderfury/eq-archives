<B>Part 1: Candidates and Guides and GMs, oh MY!</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>How Do I Get There From Here?</I></font>
      <p><font face="Arial">
Okay, the Guide/GM system works a little like D&D monks.  First, IF you have worked up two characters to 10th level you can become a
<i>Candidate</I>
 by e-mailing <a href="mailto:eqseniors@989studios.com">eqseniors@989studios.com</a> with your name, account,
and character information and filling out the application you get back.  You

then go on the list and if you're lucky will be chosen to be an
<i>Apprentice Guide</I>
and be chaperoned by a Senior Guide.  When the Elder Guides on the server
and at least
one GM-Admin decide you are ready, you become a <i>Guide</I> and are
expected to
contribute at least 10 hrs/week doing Guide Stuff.  If you prove yourself
and
work extra hours as a Guide, you might be asked by the Elder Guides (takes
ALL of them
and at least one GM-Admin) to become a
<I>Senior Guide</I> for your server and help manage the guide program on the
server, do detective work for the Elders, and coordinate guide activity.
Finally,
if you are an extra-good Senior Guide someday you might become an <I>Elder
Guide</I>, 
the interface between Verant and the guide program, and coordinate
activities
across all servers (and get to boss the Senior Guides around).<BR><BR>

What do we learn from this?  First of all, when you see an Apprentice Guide
around
you are seeing their character as they were before they got Guided, except
they 
are buffed to 20th if below 20th level.  They don't 
have hardly any powers except being non-aggro to everything and being able
to make
Gate potions to unstick the stuck (and presumably they should only be doing
this while
chaperoned).  Second, there is supposed to be 1 Guide for
every 100 player accounts (not characters) active on a server, 1 Senior
Guide for
every Guide, and it is assumed just a handful of Elder Guides (as otherwise
getting
ALL approvals each time for guide promotion would be a nightmare) across all
servers.
If Guides play as often as players, we should expect to see 15 Guides
and 1 Senior Guide online when there are 1500 people on a server, as well as
at 
least a couple apprentice guides.  <BR><BR>

<I>Guide Powers</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">
Apprentice Guides and Above have the following powers:<BR>
- Get a cool Guide robe <BR>
- Buffed to 20th level if below 20th<BR>
- Made non-aggro to all mobs in the game<BR>
- Harvest Stone (makes food) and Spring Urn (makes water)<BR>
- Staff of Guidance (creates potion of Gate)<BR>
- Use of Petition Tool to review and escalate petitions<BR>
That's it!  Additionally, Apprentice Guides are not allowed to go places
they
shouldn't be able to survive in without their non-aggro status, like Lower
Guk
or the actual castle in Mistmoore.  They do not handle calls other than
informational
or "stuck" calls, they will merely upgrade the call in the petition queue
and tell
you a higher level monk (I mean guide) will help you.  They will not monitor
or
discuss exploitation or abuse calls.  They aren't supposed to be online
unless
a full Guide is also online and not anonymous.  <BR><BR>

Guides and Above have the following powers:<BR>
- Get to buy cool Verdant armor or Robes<BR>
- Buffed to 50th level if below 50th<BR>
- Air Bead (levitate)<BR>
- Binding Stone (casts Bind Affinity)<BR>
- Cloak of Vashaar (resurrect target)<BR>
- Earring of Z (breath underwater, fatigue/hp regen, +20 STR)<BR>
- Eyepatch of Lio (See Invisible and Ultravision)<BR>
- Girdle of Journey (super-SoW)<BR>
- Glamour Stone (increases faction with target NPC)<BR>
- Ring of Dispelling (cancel magic, cure poison, cure disease)<BR>
- Ring of Invulnerability (1 minute divine aura)<BR>
- Sunset Stone (teleport to Guide Room in Plane of Air (airplane))<BR>
- Wand of Memory (clears mob of stuff it is mad at)<BR>
- /find command (locate a player, corpse, or NPC in any zone)<BR>
- /goto command (teleport to the target or to a named player or NPC)<BR>
- /hideme command (super-inviso)<BR>
- /kill command (kills target NPC with no corpse)<BR>
- /private command (speak on private channel with other Guides&Up)<BR>
- /servers command (shows what zones are available)<BR>
- /summon command (teleports player or corpse to you)<BR>
- /zone command (teleport to 0,0,0 location in any zone)<BR>
It should be noted all that cool gear is No Rent so it vanishes if dropped
and you cannot
sell or transfer it, and also Radioactive so if anyone but a Guide/GM
touches it they
are immediately killed.  All gear is purchased from NPCs in the Guide Room
in the Plane
of Air (this and the Sunset Stone are why you see folks in zone "airplane").
Guides 
can recover corpses, handle escalated calls or escalate calls further, and
answer
questions.  They can gather information about abuse or exploitation or other
complicated
matters but do not act or reprimand.   Guides are also not allowed to talk
about the
guide program or speak for the program in any public forum. <BR><BR>

Senior Guides and above have the following extra commands:<BR>
- /becomenpc (changes appearance of target PC or NPC and makes them an
NPC)<BR>
- /broadcast (message to all players on the server)<BR>
- /height (changes height of target)<BR>
- /kick (instantly camps player)<BR>
- /name (changes named player to another name)<BR>
The becomepc command is interesting because it makes the target full PvP
with no 
restrictions (i.e. anyone can attack and they can attack anyone).  None of
these
commands are supposed to be done without the player's permission (they are
not
retribution commands) and most are supposed to be done safely out of sight.
Note
that Senior Guides only have a few extra powers mainly designed to help them

set up quests.  <BR><BR>

GM-Admins and above (i.e. non-coders/testers) get these toys:<BR>
- /buff (change the level of a PC)<BR>
- /kill (mark II upgrade, can kill players with this one!)<BR>
- /lastname (grants a surname)<BR>
- /create (creates any item in the game)<BR>
- /coord (teleports you to the given x,y,z coordinates)<BR>
On GMs: A GM-Coder, GM-Art, GM-Tester, or GM-Area does not answer and calls,
should not
use powers or interact with players, and is supposed to be anonymous at all
times.  
GM-Admin is the "real" GM and answers petitions and supports Guides. These
GMs also handle
the chat, phone, and e-mail support.  GM-Lead Admin is a manager of GMs, and
GM-Mgmt is
the baddest-ass GM around and the final word on everything.  It is also interesting that
within the internal documentation the GM consistently and the Guide in some
instances
are referred to as the "CS Rep", or Customer Service Representative.
<BR><BR>

What do we learn from this?  Well, don't bother asking an apprentice guide
to do
anything more than give you some food and water so you don't starve to death
while
waiting for a REAL guide.  And even then they'd have to WALK to you.  And
don't 
expect an experience res from a GM or Guide unless they were originally a
cleric and 
they're feeling nice.  A Guide can do anything for you except return your
lost
level and items, but on the flip side even if you REALLY piss them off they
can't kill
you and they aren't even supposed to /kick you.  If you legitimately lost
items,
 a GM can create any item in the game for you.  <BR><BR>

Also, Apprentice Guides are not supposed to be using their powers to find
out 
where the Froglok Ghoul Sage spawns so if you see a 20th level apprentice
running
around Lower Guk petition your ass off.  Guides are not supposed to
reprimand players,
take sides in an argument (although they can pass on a recommendation to the
Senior Guides),
or take action against abuse or exploitation, so if one starts bossing you
around you
can tell them they better leave that kind of activity to their "betters".   
Finally, Guides and GMs are only supposed to use their
powers to aid players in trouble so if you see anything otherwise let ol'
John Smedley <a href="mailto:(jsmedley@verant.com">(jsmedley@verant.com</a>) know, or alternatively the Gm-Lead Admin
      <a href="mailto:(jbutler@verant.com">(jbutler@verant.com</a>).
<BR><BR>
My opinion after reading all this is that your best bet when in need is to
state clearly and succinctly on your petition what
your problem is and what you want the guide to do.  
If the person that responds says they can do nothing or to e-mail someone, 
you should ask that it be escalated instead.  <BR><BR>

<I>Next installment: We review Verant's Customer Service policies and the
degree to 
which they control when and where a "CS Rep" can open his or her big
mouth<BR></i></font>
