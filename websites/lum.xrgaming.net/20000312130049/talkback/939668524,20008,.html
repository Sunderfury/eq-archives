This file can contain SSI calls, but you may have to edit npa_ktalk.pl and
ktalkpost.cgi to give the generated files a .shtml extension.

This file is pure HTML, except for certain "magic comments" which are
substituted with other values when a talkback page is being generated. 

IMPORTANT: They are shown here with the * character inside them. This is so that
kTalk does not process these examples. When actually using these, remove the *s.

<!-*-ktalk news-*->: The full news item that this talkback thread is about. This
is in your normal news style, as generated by DoNewsHTML in ndisplay.pl or what

<!-*-ktalk postURL-*->: The URL to ktalkpost.cgi.

<!-*-ktalk postnum:0-*-> and <!-*-ktalk newsID-*->: Used internally. Don't edit

AND STUFF.</b></font> <font size="3" color="#C0C0C0">Monday, October 11, 1999 - 2:02 PM<br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><a href="http://uo.drtwister.com/">St. Twister</a>, showing that he has done his penance and learned his lesson from OSI threatening to sue his baby, posted a house looting bug involving, once again, shrooms. Immediately thereafter every drooling yard ape decided to help all those macroing merchants get rid of their thousands of bows and wooden shields being prepared for the dancing gorilla trash barrels. Vapor's official response was to <a href="http://uo.drtwister.com/">feel bad for you</a>. <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/">Nighthawk</a>, whose towers were looted dry, had a simpler solution, namely killing everyone.<br><br>You know, it just looks like I'm on drugs when I post UO news, but this is pretty much what has been happening. Who needs psychotropics when we have the "<a href="http://members.home.com/thorsanvil/uorevolt/">Phase III Protest</a>" (thank God at least it's not a goddam <a href="http://www.eqdruids.com/prayer.htm">petition</a>). Some folks just think they have a god-given right to hoard millions of items and cause Atlantic and other servers to go down for backup at 6a, come back at 12p, and then timewarp back to 8p the next morning. Some folks also believe that voting for <a href="http://www.davidduke.com/">this guy</a> is a neat idea, too, so who am I to bitch.<br><br>Speaking of unrepentant Nazis, I was gone all weekend to the Texas Ren Fair, which had thousands of nearly naked women in chain mail, including two that were, um, amusing themselves in a corner. Murm happened to observe this and we haven't been able to get a pulse since. Somewhere amidst the cheap beer, lesbians and chainmail some folks from OSI showed up for a luncheon. I didn't take copious notes (OK, so I didn't take ANY notes after the first five minutes) but the gist of it is that you pinheads have accumulated about 50 teraquads too much stuff, and the server databases will be removed to a decent size, both through fair means (new items such as alchemy barrels for potion storage and the ability to share co-ownership of houses and trade secure chests in for more lockdowns for you r0l3playaz out there) and foul (making everything else GO AWAY). Most of the rest of the lunch consisted of the Great Lakes Counselors cheering for themselves. I'm not kidding. Nope. <br><br>I also got to meet Jessica "Durga" Mulligan and Jason "I'm-The-Goddam-Boss" Bell, both of whom are avid readers of the site. Um, hi, sorry I couldn't be more talkative but I was busy being consumed by heatstroke at the time. Also present were Sage, who earlier in the fair was singled out by an ugly woman who dumped dirty water on him. Nope, I'm not making this up either. She sprayed me with water too because I was sitting in the corner wishing I were somewhere else. And as a switch, a GM (GM Rock) was there who looked 30 but insisted he wasn't a day over 18. I think he and GM Gabriel just switched ID cards and forgot. <br><br>Oh, and if you were to destroy all airports on the planet in a horrible fiery cataclysm, <b>I wouldn't mind in the least</b>.

You're playing a game where backstabbing is the rule and you apparently doing well at it... then someone got you and you just can't take it! That's too funny, can't take some of your own medicine, typical pre-pube kEwliO d00dz. Cry me a river about your loss, and go kill everyone you come in contact with... someone is still out there snickering because they robbed you blind...

I merely am going to go out of the game doing what I like best - pking.  I'm sorry that people like you can't comprehend pking, but it's not an uncontrolable release of rage.<br><br>Any moron that equates that to real life terms such as &quot;don't be around him if someone flattens his tire&quot; is truly lost - this is a game.  I like pking and I'm going to leave pking.  If I can spread the word while I do it (and I can), then I will.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

So what does he do?  Kills anyone and everyone.  Not only is that lame, it's pretty stupid.  Don't go near him if someone flattens his tire in real life, he might grab his gun and start shooting everyone nearby, thinking that'll solve the problem.  Better solution, start mass emailing OSI and DEMAND your stuff returned since THEY are the ones responsible for this.  That's how it should be done.<!--ktalk end_comment-->
