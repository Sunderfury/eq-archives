  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I first got to 
    Origin, I was actually keen on using a name I've used in roleplaying games 
    for a long time. Xavia.. but, as a community person, I felt that perhaps I 
    should allow myself to be named by the community. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first place I started 
    talked to people was on the Horizon's board, for the Ascension crowd.. and 
    I proposed this to them. They took to the idea like fish to water. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">RG's pet name for my 
    position was the "Minister of Information" and I shared that detail with the 
    board. After a couple of iterations on the M.O.I. theme, Lady MOI was chosen 
    by the group, and I accepted the name. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we put the official 
    Ascension boards up at Origin, they technology didn't allow for spaces, and 
    so the space between Lady and MOI was dropped. LadyMOI.</font></i></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I still like the name &quot;Spin 
  Dragon&quot;. But I'll accept that we in the UO community take second place 
  to those U:A dweebs. However, I think LadySpinMOIDragon had a pretty cool idea. 
  So let's rename Lum! What do you think I should be named? Dippy Dragon? Scourge 
  of Binky? A$$r0x0R? <a href="mailto:lum@webtoys.net">Send em in.</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Correction noted. On a far 
  less important note, <a href="mailto:sirfragmor@yahoo.com">Sir Fragmor</a> has 
  something to say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Community. </font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Community would assume 
    people together being social. This was one of UOs big selling points way back 
    when and you can still hear them chanting it today. "It hurts the community", 
    "It would'nt be good for the online gaming community" Well its funny that 
    they have these concerns about the "community" cause THEY themselves are setting 
    forth precendents that will hurt the "Community" much more than any macro-miner 
    or PK. A commune of people suggests interaction between members of players. 
    Be that team work in fighting monsters, defeating PKs, questing, or treasure 
    hunting. The point is these are all things that help Build, Make, and perpetuate 
    the "community" because they are social in nature, as is a "community". </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Recently the Dev Team 
    has started to crack down on "unassisted" macroing due to its terrible affects 
    on the game balance. I find it odd that a given UO player who has: an intrnet 
    connection, a web browser, and access to the same FREE download sites that 
    I do, is at a disadvantage simply because THEY do not choose to use any of 
    those tools to download a free program and macro. At this point it becomes 
    a active CHOICE of a UO player to NOT macro. The software to macro is FREE,

    that the game came in, so WHY exactly is my macroing with EZMacros a game 
    imbalance? </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I digress... </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Back to the "community" 
    issue. There is no communal effort involved in cutting up fish steaks. There 
    is no teamwork invloved in cooking meat. There is no festive esprit de corps 
    whilst mining ore. There is no roleplaying when determining the Dexterity 
    and Physical Strength or Intelligence of the town cryer. Here is where we 
    find OSI putting the players of UO at odds with 2 directives. On the one hand, 
    you need these NON COMMUNITY building skills in order to actually participate 
    in COMMUNITY activites and have fun. You need meat for food, cooking to prepare 
    it, Ore for armor, Anatomy and Eval Int for PvP and PvM capabilities but wait!! 
    On the OTHER hand......actually building ANY of these skills requires HOURS 
    and HOURS of NON SOCIAL, NON INTERACTIVE, NON TEAM ORIENTED time. This time 
    is normally spent macroing overnight while the player is sleeping or doing 
    other real life things. When they actually want to play this Community Oriented 
    game they dont want to play it doing non community things. OSI obviously is 
    being extremely doubleminded in their efforts. OSI, we HEAR you, we WANT to 
    help the community by actually BEING PART OF IT. A player ISNT part of a Community 
    if they are sitting there cutting up fish steaks not talking with other players. 
    Why is this a hard concept to ascertain?!?!?! </i></font></p>

  it was, believe it or not, to provide some sort of balance to the constant OSI 
  bashing going on. <a href="wannabesenithwhenigrowup.html">L'affaire Senith was

  all parties were equally stupid, Dr. TwisTer picked up on it, and away weeee 
  gooooo. Good thing my job basically requires me to sit by the phone and wait 
  for stupid people to call.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, I had no idea 
  that the entire support staff of UO would take this time to go <b>collectively 
  mad.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It all started when someone 
  deigned to tell Tug over at <a href="http://www.tugsoft.com/UOAssist/" target="_blank">UOA 
  Central</a> that his proggy wasn't ever going to be approved since it encouraged 
  automated macroing. We all laughed at that one. Come on! Everyone macros! The 
  game design is built around it! </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They weren't joking. Folks 
  are <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/jov/images/macroban.jpg" target="_blank">really 
  being booted for macroing</a>. I haven't heard of folks being banned for macroing 
  yet, but surely that's coming. I personally have pretty consistently gotten 
  Connection Lost's for the past couple nights while placidly sitting in Skara 
  Brae with my newbie miner trying to work my strength up so that I can carry 
  more than 10 pounds at a time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.murderdeathkill.com/">MDK 
  got banned</a>. Now I know, everyone in MDK was a waste of bodily fluids. Still. 
  Collective punishment is just wrong. It's like saying my guildmates need to 
  be banned because I write a web page that liberally uses the word &quot;fuck&quot;. 
  (Lum watches his hit counter suddenly zoom up tenfold from search engine hits.) 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And now all the <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/let-src.html">sordid 
  little bitching and moaning</a> among the Counselor/SRC/Seer/GM cliques is out 
  in the open. As LadyMOI would say, &quot;Woop! Woop!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This has many layers of 
  sadness. I'll just exposit a little by telling you my personal experiences with 
  all of this.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A guildmate of mine had 
  something weird happen. I won't explain exactly what, but it was of such a nature 
  that combined with everything else going on this week, he was VERY paranoid 
  about being banned for no apparent reason. (It probably would not be a big surprise 
  if I told you he was macroing at the time.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A close friend of mine is 
  involved in the UO Support Program, and has access to all the Seekrit Channels. 
  So I was able, through him, to very quickly gain access to folks who could try 
  to find out exactly what was going on and why. It was all pretty much straightened 
  out quickly and efficiently, like customer support is, y'know, supposed to work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nature of what happened 
  was interesting enough that I thought it would merit an update here. But I didn't 
  want to antagonize the people who had just helped me out (not to mention pissing 
  my wife off), so I chatted for a second with the support person he was talking 
  to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I wanted to explain who 
  I was, what page I write for (he had never heard of it, but assumed it was a 
  TwisTer clone - gee.) and to clear what I was going to write with him, so that 
  anything that shouldn't be public knowledge wouldn't be. You know, polite stuff. 
  (Believe it or not I like to think I'm a decent enough sort in real life.)</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The response was one hundred 
  percent stonewall. You will not misquote me, what you thought I said was wrong, 
  I don't appreciate you doing what you're doing, especially with the issues the 
  support program is having right now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got pretty pissed at this 
  point. Issues?, I said. Lately the players have been having a few &quot;issues&quot; 
  as well. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The conversation 
  closed at that point, unsurprisingly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hell of it is, the person 
  I was talking to, up until that point, I thought was a friend. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are the enemy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that is an issue that

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me tell 
  you a story, my children...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was a 
  land once, we'll call it the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, just for shits 
  and giggles. There was this event called the Great Purge, where a very bad man 
  named Stalin sent millions of people to labor camps merely for looking sideways.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was a 
  little boy, named Pavlik Morozov. He was a very studious boy, and did very well 
  in school. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One day his 
  teachers explained to him what &quot;class enemies&quot; and &quot;enemies of 
  the people&quot; were. They were bad people, who worked against Comrade Stalin 
  and his glorious worker's paradise. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pavlik was 
  told that it was his duty, as a little soldier in service to the state, to tell 
  his teachers of anyone who was an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;. Even his 
  parents. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pavlik was 
  confused, but he did what he was told, and told his teachers about the conversations 
  his parents had late at night, when no one was listening, about how Comrade 
  Stalin was really a monster destroying his country.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pavlik's parents 
  disappeared soon thereafter, and Pavlik was sent to a camp for good little soldiers. 
  There was even a statue to Pavlik in his home town, as an example to all good 
  little soldiers. Children everywhere in the USSR were told to be noble as Pavlik, 
  to tell their teachers and policemen whenever anyone said bad things.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they did. 
  The children were the worst scourges of the land, <b>because they were given 
  the power to be so</b>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I am not 
  so ate up with it that I think being prohibited from macroing in any way relates 
  to the annihilation of a people. But that's not the point.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The USSR was 
  a corrupt land, and it was made so in large part by the rendering of the rule 
  of law as trivial. There was no overriding set of rules that a sane person could 
  follow - people were killed for espousing a particular Party line one month, 
  and be rewarded for it the next. The enforcement of &quot;law&quot; was capricious 
  and whimsical, and this bred terror.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Terror.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already 
  established that 95% of the UO population (and 99.99999% of the pvp subset) 
  macros. We are all criminals now - we can be removed from the game at will. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we won't. 
  We'll continue to build our characters in the same fashion, simply because there 
  is no alternative. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On a related 
  subject, I got a <a href="youvegotgothmail.html">well written rant</a> from 
  a goth who plays UO last night, who took offense at my labelling the little 
  pusbags in Colorado that layed waste to their school &quot;goths who were pissy 
  that jocks got all the cool shit.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First off, 
  I'm wasn't saying &quot;all goths are bad&quot;. Hell, when I was in high school 
  I did my share of dyed black hair and pancake makeup, but back then it was the 
  80's and more of a fashion statement then anything else. Now it's like a whole 
  subculture that I somehow missed. However, at the time I wrote that, the mass 
  media, always an impeccable source of correct information, was saying that the 
  two or three or twenty shooters were goths who listened to the Cure one too 
  many times and decided to end everyone else's pain too. (Actually I made that 
  last part up. To connect the Cure to Goths would have required actual research. 
  Instead they just beat on Marilyn Manson for a while because he's a strange 
  little girlyman with man breasts. When I was in New York last year his album 
  had just came out, and Interscope had purchased a HUGE billboard in Times Square 
  with this 50 foot Marilyn Manson staring down at you with his nakedness. I blame 
  that experience for the web page you are now reading.)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we're going 
  to hear for the next year or so that video games are bad for you and the Internet 
  breeds killers because one of them <a href="http://doomnation.com/afterglow/">posted 
  a DOOM wad</a> (man, you gotta love those iD guys for subtlety in naming conventions) 
  on AOL. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leaving aside 
  for the moment that if I hear AOL referred to as the Internet ONE MORE TIME 
  I may breed a killer inside of me my own damned self. And the fact that these 
  two guys were so lame that they actually bought those godawful Doom &quot;fiction&quot; 
  books.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We like to

  some poor roleplayer around screaming &quot;We're going to A$zZ Rap3 j00!&quot; 
  It hits the boards and immediately everyone takes sides. The PKers, who spend 
  much of their time picking on roleplayers, are frightened that OSI will start 
  banning THEIR guilds. The roleplayers, who spend much of their time bitching 
  at OSI about the roleplayers picking on them, are celebrating that OSI *are*

<blockquote>

    stops macroing, then the advancement rates of skills will rise. Less macroing 
    actually will mean less NEED to macro. Because of how the advancement table

    have been macroed. </i></font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just more 
    fuel for the fire. :)</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, DUH.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I think 
  I've made clear over and again, this relates to PvP mostly because that's mostly 
  how I play. My wife is almost exclusively PvM (and actually lately more PvFish) 
  and she macros almost as much as I do, though. And she is a HARDCORE roleplayer. 
  So although this isn't a PK or an anti-roleplayer thing, the following comes 
  from my experiences tearing up my fellow man.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PvP is a test 
  of skill. Given everything else being equal, the guild with more skillful PLAYERS 
  will defeat their opposition. This is as it should be.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, if 
  that guild ties both hands behind their back and hobbles into battle armed only 
  with a butcher knife and wearing a jester's cap for armor, they will likely 
  lose no matter how bad-assed their players may be. The stats of the player's 
  characters do come into play.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, why would 
  ANY reasonably adept PvP combatant choose to handicap themselves against their 
  opponents?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There already 
  are ethical choices in PvP. I don't use UOE. I think UOE users are slime-infested 
  pusbags and I take great joy in watching my deadly poison cause the screen to 
  fill up with autocasted failed Kal Ort Pors. But UOE gives its users an advantage. 
  UOA users have to hit their Disarm macro button, slam Alt-H to fire off a Greater 
  Heal, and hit Home to target self. Non-enhanced users have to manually drag 
  their weapons off of their paperdoll into their backpack, slam Alt-H to fire 
  off a greater heal, and mouse over to their onscreen representation and click 
  on it. UOE users have to hit Heal Self. Guess who's going to heal first.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it's a fine 
  line that you walk. Personally, my stance is that UOA is not a &quot;cheat utility&quot; 
  like UOE is, but an improvement to UO (which the dev team has stated will eventually 
  be worked into the actual client). And just because OSI decided to waffle about 
  whether or not to grant UOA &quot;legit&quot; status for six months before finally 
  giving it the thumbs down is irrelevant to me. It's like Microsoft telling me 
  I can't use Borland Delphi to program Windows apps, but I have to use Microsoft 
  Visual Basic. I suppose legally they could because Microsoft owns the rights 
  to Windows, but that doesn't mean I will use an inferior tool because Microsoft 
  tells me to. (And all you C geeks just shut your damn mouth. I like pretty guis.)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, you might 
  say, what's the difference between hitting one key in UOE and three keys in 
  UOA? It's still an advantage other players don't have.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sure. But let's 
  look at the facts. People who do pvp either use UOE, UOA, or are so skilled 
  with the client from repetitive practice they find neither necessary. I'm not. 
  I'm a klutz. I drop things on a regular basis. If you expect me to fumble with 
  my mouse for five minutes every time I have to heal myself, I'm going to take 
  a lot of dirt naps. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So do I want 
  to handicap myself? No. Is it unethical not to handicap myself? In my view, 
  my line is drawn in the correct spot. Your line may differ.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what does 
  all this have to do about macroing? It's the same drawing of the lines. Where 
  does your ethics draw your line. For me, I'm not going to unilaterally disarm. 
  Why would any sane person involved in pvp NOT macro? &quot;Well, if I can get 
  my anatomy up to 100, I get a 10% bonus on my damage dealt. Everyone I fight, 
  pretty much, in hand to hand is going to have that same bonus. <i>But I don't 
  want to macro unattended, because it would be wrong, it's an exploit, and OSI 
  said not to do it. </i>And raising Anatomy by hand will take six months and 
  drive me completely insane in the process. So I guess I'll just do less damage.&quot; 
  Do YOU know anyone who would say that? I don't.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then there's 
  the bandwidth issue. I know all about bandwidth, I used to work for an ISP back 
  before I grew a clue. You've got thousands of people wasting 2K of bandwidth 
  a pop connected to the OSI servers and they're not even really there. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, &quot;Designer&quot; 
  Dragon, that is YOUR fault, bud. <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/skillsessay.htm" target="_blank">You 
  designed the game that way</a>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You implemented 
  a skill tree with logarithmic progression that cripples itself as more people 
  use each skill. Was the goal to just make less Grandmasters? Um, welcome to 
  human nature. Everyone wants to be a Grandmaster. Everyone wants to win. Especially 
  pvp'ers, who are actually playing to win as opposed to roleplayers who generally 
  are in a &quot;play&quot; environment as opposed to a &quot;contest&quot; environment.

  you do about it, smack everyone upside the head who dares to follow the dictate

<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
    in-game admin faces a bizarre problem. He is exercising power that the ordinary 
    virtual citizen cannot. And he is looked to in many ways to provide a certain 
    atmosphere and level of civility in the environment. Yet the fact remains 
    that no matter how scrupulously honest he is, no matter how just he shows 
    himself to be, no matter how committed to the welfare of the virtual space 
    he may prove himself, people will hate his guts. They will mistrust him precisely 
    because he has power, and they can never know him. There will be false accusations 
    galore, many insinuations of nefarious motives, and former friends will turn 
    against him. It may be that the old saying about power and absolute power 
    is just too ingrained in the psyche of most people; whatever the reasons, 
    there has never been an online game whose admins could say with a straight 
    face that all their players really trusted them.&quot;</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd add a new 
  rule. Call it &quot;Lum's Laws of Human Frailty&quot;;</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Given 
    enough motive, any game admin can be corrupted.<br>

  and read about the GM who was slipped $5,000 under the table to create an Ubercharacter 
  that would be sold by a third party on eBay. $5,000 to a kid just out of/still 
  in college is a lot of money. And I just see the current &quot;Well, we'll ban 
  you for macroing, but only if we feel like it&quot; as just another incredible 
  enabler for ingame administrative corruption.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do I think 
  should be done? Find some way to autoboot anyone using UOE/UOA/UOWazoo. Wipe 
  the shards. Start clean. If you want to reset the skill curve, that's great. 
  But don't punish those who follow simply because they showed up too late to 
  get away with it.</font></p>

    = 1080 minutes. Therefore I repeated peacemaking 5400 times for 1.1 gain. 
    Mathematics my man, they cannot twist mathematics to their needs...</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, given that 
  the average Ultima Online fanatic is online staring at their screen 4 hours 
  a day, 5 days a week (which is generous for me and most other adults with lives 
  they call their own), this means that on the shard with not only the coolest 
  name but the least restrictive skill curve, it will take you somewhere around 
  45 weeks to make GM, assuming that you began a dedicated bard with an initial 
  skill of 50. This also does not take into account the logarithmic progression 
  of skill gain, or, in English, that it takes something short of forever to gain 
  in skill once you break 90. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So if you want 
  to be an honest bard and not one of those EvIl ExPLoITeRS, you best get cracking.</font></p>

  every day to be more like my friend &quot;Dr.&quot; TwisTer, I think we should

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Got a few emails

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO is a virtual

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And OSI is 
  the DEA.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bear with me 
  here. Macroing and third party program use is like smoking marijuana. No one 
  gets up during church and announces &quot;Yeah, I smoked a spliff the other 
  day and I still got some left, want some?&quot;, but if you had a Magic Truthsaying 
  Machine I imagine if you surveyed everyone in America under 50 you'd have very 
  few people who didn't know how to inhale.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And like marijuana, 
  most people understand that macroing, and by extenstion the use of third party 
  programs, while illicit, is also quite widespread. This isn't a genie you can 
  stuff back in the bottle. And there are quite a few things more hazardous than 
  marijuana, or macroing. Like, say, instant vendor kills. Were my wife's vendors 
  mysteriously slain? Or was it just a bug, like the time she lost a chest off 
  a boat in thin air and the GM, responding to the call, said &quot;Well, I guess 
  *it just washed off the boat!*&quot;. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But no, instead 
  of actually performing customer service the GMs in UO are more concerned with 
  tracking down and destroying recreational marijuana users -- er, unattended 
  macroers. And you know, most of the time it's because someone narced on the 
  victim in question.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I guess

  Unless you have no intention of ever engaging in player vs player combat, and 
  for that matter pretty much intend to relegate yourself to maybe beating up 
  the occasional ratman in between hanging out at your tavern, if you do not macro, 
  your character is inferior and will DIE. Constantly.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not to mention 
  the fact that many skills are just incredibly BORING. Mining. Anatomy. Evaluate

  what I personally have macroed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OSI even has 
  macroing built into the client. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The kicker 
  is &quot;unattend macroing&quot; - aka actually going off and doing something 
  productive. Although currently it's cute to be all coy and shit and say &quot;Oh, 
  I NEVER use Banned Third Party Utilities&quot;, everyone either uses UO Assist 
  (if they're ethical) or UO Extreme (if they're a pud) or UO Plugin (if they're

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The one exception

    are moongates available to make an insta-Shake-n-Bake 7xGM (in other words, 
    a maxxed out character). So this is the perfect place to experiment with what 
    skills you want to work on with your real character. Just ignore the rabble 
    asking you where the fencing gate is. Note that Abyss is PK happy, but hell, 
    so are the rest of the shards so it's good practice in survival. Plus, you'll 
    find out after a while that having GM Everything isn't really that different 
    from your own sad ass character on other shards. You still miss half the time.

  seen a Japanese player trash talk after they kill anyone. Then again I guess 
  I have my transerv off too. (Doesn't everybody?)</p>

  him of COB's board, since the only thing remotely &quot;interactive&quot; on

  your server list to just Abyss and TC, you would get approximately 9 skillion

  (Note that you can't read any of these messages any more since the UO community

<p>I'm not sure what we can do about this. I have this radical idea of actually 
  using the little message that comes up from the patch server THAT IS SENT TO 
  YOU EVERY TIME YOU LOG ON EVEN THOUGH IT ONLY CHANGES ONCE EVERY GEOLOGIC ERA 
  to actually be useful and tell you when things are going wrong, but the patch 
  server probably doesn't have notepad installed on it, so that's right out. I 
  know that OSI has this big web site that cranks out Java and Shockwave and style 
  sheets and dynamic fonts and Kilrathi spaceships and <a href="http://town.owo.com/6.shtml" target="_blank">crazed

<p>So here's the thing. In the future, whenever the servers decide to roll over

  to run macros unattended, and this was a bad thing.</p>
<p> Well gee. Ultima Online has been running for a good solid two years now, and 
  they just now decided that macroing was bad. OK. If macroing is verboten, first 
  off they had probably talk to all those folks who write Windows automation software 
  (I think Microsoft is one of those companies). And while they're at it, they 
  should take everyone's pennies away, so they don't *accidentally* jam into the 
  keyboard and cause a macro to run. And they had <b>damned</b> well do a shard 
  wipe so that newbies don't wonder why they can never get past 45 strength while 
  GM Buttwipes give them the beatdown the second they leave town.</p>
<p>If you don't want people to macro, don't make the skills so freaking tedious 
  to raise that people HAVE to macro. Hell, I don't know, flash porn on screen 
  every 10 minutes. Then the typical UO player would never leave his keyboard. 
  Ever. He'd probably ask the porn for a date. He'd have a meaningful relationship 
  with the porn. Eventually the porn would leave him though, and he'd go back 
  to macroing. Probably using UOE. </p>

  BUCKS ON </b></font><b><font color="#FFFF00">EVERQUEST AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS 
  DEAD TROLL</font></b></p>
<p align="left">Well, I was one of the first in line to purchase Everquest when 
  it came out (OK, so there wasn't a line, but I did call EB to reserve a copy) 
  with the hopes that I could leave the madness and codependency of Sosaria forever 
  behind me.</p>
<p align="left">In yer dreams, Jack.</p>
<p align="left">Everquest is like a beautiful, mentally retarded woman. At first 
  you're entranced, but then it starts to sink in that something is missing... 
  but if you could only put your finger on what. </p>
<p align="left">The user interface looks like it was based on a web page on GeoCities. 
  Beautiful, stunning scenery surrounded by a butt-ugly control scheme that takes 
  up half the page. You can turn off the butt-ugly control scheme, with the tradeoff 
  that you can then not actually do anything. </p>
<p align="left">I was first introduced to the Friendly Everquest Fascism when 
  I tried to name my character. No Lum the Mad for me... spaces are forbidden 
  in Their World Now! So, merely Lum and chastened, I started my plucky halfling 
  theif on the road to glory.</p>
<p align="left">Five minutes later, after I died, I tried again. Ten minutes later, 
  after I died, I tried a new character, a Troll Shadowknight also named Lum. 
  Since the Troll city is so hard to find the exit to, his lifespan was considerably 
  longer.</p>
<p align="left">We won't mention the half-elf ranger who fell off a tree, or the 
  barbarian fighter who was too weak to fight off a crab or whatever the hell 
  it was. </p>
<p align="left">OK, I dug in, studied Stratics, and figured out how the hell to 
  survive more than five minutes at a time In Their World Now. It involved bunny 
  bashing. OK, I've played UO, I can bunny bash with the best of them, dammit.</p>
<p align="left">Except that, reading and playing and studying other characters, 
  the whole game is basically one large bunny bash. You just keep moving on to 
  larger and larger bunnies. (Some of those bunnies are HUUUGE. With big nasty 
  teeth!)</p>
<p align="left">There isn't much else to do in Everquest. You can go on &quot;quests&quot; 
  which are kind of like the ones that NPCs in UO used to give you back when UO 
  started, only not quite as mindlessly stupid. However, the XP that they give 
  you doesn't compare to what you get by bashing 10,000 bunnies over the head 
  in mindnumbing sequence. PvP is pretty much nonexistent, from what I saw. In 
  fact really the only fun I had was watching the creature spawn points, since 
  the creatures spawned some 20 feet off the ground before running around in a 
  vague simulation of &quot;AI&quot;.</p>
<p align="left">Crafts? Muahahaha. Everquest has crafts, and they are tailor made 
  to those who thought being a GM smith in UO was just too damn easy. You can 
  work for hours and maybe come up with some patchwork piece of tattered leather 
  that a troll MAY be not embarassed to be seen in. No matter HOW good you are, 
  you can never make armor as good as what's in the NPC shops, which pretty much 
  ensures that the player economy is going to stay firmly in the toilet.</p>
<p align="left">All the Everquest reviewers rave about how the game &quot;encourages 
  you to work in groups&quot; (in the same way Everquest encourages you to do 
  everything else, very similar to the way Serbs &quot;encourage&quot; Kosovar 
  Albanians to emigrate). While this is a fine and noble concept, in execution 
  it results in groups of total strangers, since even if you somehow could FIND 
  your friends and guildmates (since there is no ICQ and IRC In Their World... 
  hell there's not even an Alt-Tab or Ctrl-Alt-Delete In Their World) you wouldn't 
  be able to group with them unless you were at almost their EXACT experience 
  level. There is supposedly a valid reason for this, involving some odd MUD term 
  I can't really think of.</p>
<p align="left">So basically I have an Everquest CD I can't use, an account that 
  keeps accumulating free days as 989 refuses to learn from OSI's experience (&quot;You 
  mean that having all the servers in the same place on the same ISP is bad? NO 
  WAY, dude!?!&quot;), and a lot of dead trolls. Maybe I should get ahead of the 
  curve and auction it all off on E-Bay.</p>

  <p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFF00">4/13/99 - PAGING LINDA TRIPP, LINE FOUR...</font></b></p>
<p align="left">OK, I like mean, vicious gossip as much as the next waste of bodily 
  fluids, but this latest exchange in &quot;<a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html" target="_blank">Dr. 
  Twister vs. those mean and nasty gumps at OSI</a>&quot; has just left the playing 
  field.</p>
<p align="left">There's so many sad asses in this tale that you can't sort them 
  out. You just can't. Rest easily, however for, I, Lum the Sanity Challenged, 
  have sorted this all out for you.</p>
<p align="left">Some background. There's this game, Ultima Online. Many people 
  thought it was a neat idea once. Unfortunately, the UO programming team hadn't 
  QUITE worked through volume 2 of &quot;C for Dummies&quot; yet, which included 
  the chapter on debugging and QA teams, so they hit on the idea of posting their 
  unstable code on a test center (called &quot;Test Center&quot;, doubtless to 
  conceal their fiendish plans) and then after a week moving that unstable code 
  to the production servers, where after a while those bugs would be moved to 
  the &quot;creative uses of the game's system&quot; column and new bugs would 
  be introduced to the test server.</p>
<p align="left">This went along happily for a while, except that people started 
  characters on Test Center. They worked over them, slaved over them (well, they 
  let <a href="http://www.tugsoft.com/UOAssist/" target="_blank">UOAssist</a> 
  slave over them while they watched Buffy and Dawson's Creek), formed guilds, 
  towns, citadels, lives. They considered themselves cooler than all the other 
  UO LewSers because, you know, they're on test center. Debugging. Man, it's hard 
  work debugging. You have to hang around the Brit forge all day and kill newbies. 
  But pros can handle it.</p>
<p align="left">Needless to say, these players were not unhappy when talk started 
  of the Test Center being wiped (apparently missing the big bold letters that 
  said TEST CENTER on the login page). One of them was a Counselor named Senith. 
</p>
<p align="left">Counselors hang around in their own *secret*private* IRC channel. 
  In fact, that's all that the great majority of them do (which explains why your 
  call for help goes unanswered for upwards of, oh, forever). Because, you know, 
  it's hard work counseling. You have to hang around the IRC channel all day and 
  page GMs little kiss up notes. But pros can handle it. Anyway, one night in 
  this channel Senith buttonholed a GM named IronWill (you notice how all GMs 
  have these <b>FEAR INDUCING </b> names? You never hear of GM Bunny Rabbit or 
  GM Friendly Puppy or GM Zippy -- oh wait, there is a GM Zippy, nevermind) about 
  how mean it was that the Test Center was down.</p>
<p align="left">IronWilly then showed that he had zero experience in cover-yer-ass 
  Corporate Amerika by actually speaking his mind about the wonderful aspects 
  of humanity that you see on Test Center. The whole thing is <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/let-log.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
  It's here because Senith left the *secret*private* channel and immediately ran 
  out and posted it on the first message base he tripped over.</p>
<p align="left">IronWilly then presumably was called into the principal's office 
  and informed in no uncertain terms that OSI employees were forbidden from having 
  opinions; as part of his penance he had to write &quot;I will not be mean to 
  people on Test Center&quot; 500 times in email to UO sites. </p>
<p align="left">Senith then decided that the only proper... the ONLY moral thing 
  to do was to immediately quit UO and form a &quot;The Matrix&quot; fan club. 
  <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/let-seni.html" target="_blank">I 
  only wish I were joking.</a> In a letter to Dr. Twister (the moral conscience 
  of Ultima Online, and if you don't believe it he'll tell you again!), he muttered 
  darkly about upcoming shard wipes (which of course the KeWl ExpLoiTer Twisties 
  immediately took as warning of a wipe of all production shards) and that Necromancy 
  sucked. </p>
<p align="left">Ignoring for the moment that EVERY skill in Ultima Online pretty 
  much bites the death cookie, Dr. Twister rode the ensuing controversy as if 
  it was his guest star on <a href="http://www.ourfirsttime.com/" target="_blank">http://www.ourfirsttime.com/</a>. 
  Every day or so in between new housing breakins (Hint: this time it's SHROOMS!) 
  he would post a breathless news update on how obviously OSI, a noted pawn of 
  the Electronic Arts combine, were out to personally whiz in every UO user's 
  wheaties. (And I have faith, if anyone could whiz in all 100,000 UO user's wheaties 
  on a personal basis, it would be Designer Dragon, the man who has made Online 
  Presence a new fighting discipline, sort of like Jeet Kune Do, but on message 
  boards.) </p>
<p align="left">Just when this tale could not possibly ever get any more mindbogglingly 
  stupid, The Ministry of Information chimes in, aka LadyMOI, refugee from another 
  <a href="http://www.golgotha.org/about/" target="_blank">train wreck</a> of 
  computer gaming, now the friendly face of the evil that is OSI. LadyMOI then 
  proceeds to break the first law of corporate public relations, the one known 
  as &quot;When your company's internal politics spill into the public view, do 
  NOT point it out to everyone you know in press releases&quot; by issuing press 
  releases to the usual suspects (<a href="http://uo.stratics.com/cgi-bin/uoss_news.pl?Community+News#6" target="_blank">here's 
  one</a>), where OSI emphasizes in no uncertain words that IronWill was a bad 
  person, the shards will not be destroyed, and Necromancy is going to be cool, 
  although you'll need to be a GM tinker, GM mage, and probably a GM beggar to 
  use it.</p>
<p align="left">The truly scary part, though, was that LadyMOI signed the press 
  release &quot;WooWoo!&quot;. Words fail. In response, Dr. Twister demanded that 
  every UO player get 2 weeks free game time because LadyMOI said &quot;WooWoo!&quot; 
  and, you know, Everquest players got 2 weeks free game time when Brad McQuaid 
  said &quot;WoahWoah!&quot;.</p>
<p align="left">OK. This has to stop. Everyone involved is probably too young 
  to drink legally, yet this is starting to resemble some sort of Byzantine conspiracy.</p>
<p align="left">Senith was an idiot. He pulls IronWill's pants down in Act 1, 
  and then wonders why no one else at OSI will talk to him in Act 2.&nbsp; Here's 
  a FREE CLUE - people tend to really hate having their drunken monologues replayed 
  at work the next morning.</p>
<p align="left">IronWill was an idiot. He actually bitched about coworkers and 
  clients in a channel choked with about 400 12 year olds waiting some &quot;ELEET 
  EXCLUSIV NOOZ&quot; they can mail Xsploitz with. The boy is obviously too stupid 
  to be trusted with important machinery, which come to think of it makes him 
  the perfect GM.</p>
<p align="left">Dr. Twister was (and continues to be) an idiot. You cannot assume 
  the moral high ground while fucking your best friend's wife. It's bad manners. 
  Either stick to posting the latest EREET HOUSING BUGS or stick to being the 
  noble defender of Ultima Online, but it's just plain silly to do both. Or, on 
  the other hand, he could just continue to point at himself regularly demanding 
  attention. Hmmm. </p>
<p align="left">LadyMOI was an idiot. She issued the &quot;OSI RESPONDS TO THE 
  IRONWILL/SENITH INCIDENT&quot; press release juuuuust a few minutes after no 
  one really cared any more. I guess it was important to note that Necromancy 
  really wasn't a cruel joke to keep people from defecting to EQ, but y'know, 
  I suspect DD could have passed that message somewhere in the 320 megs of outgoing 
  mail he sends out. </p>
<p align="left">And Lum the Mad was an idiot, because he just spent gawd only 
  knows how much time dissecting this whole sorry affair.</p>
