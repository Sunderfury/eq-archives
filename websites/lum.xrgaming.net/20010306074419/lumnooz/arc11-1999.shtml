It's Bug Warning Day. A VERY serious one now for EQ. I will NOT be posting the details on how to do this but it is rapidly becoming common knowledge in the xpl0it3r community.<br><br>It works, like most ORPG bugs, in conditions of extreme lag. Basically you can lose control of your character while you are zoning. The obvious answer would be "don't zone"... this may be unrealistic. Unfortunately I know of no other way to prevent this bug from taking effect. I will say that it requires the victim to zone a great deal and may not be 100% effective. Of course, if it's a character you value, it only needs to happen once.<br><br>If you get a note that someone else is logged into your character when trying to log in, your character has been stolen and the thief is NOW ONLINE with it. Hopefully you can go into EQ Chat and get the attention of a GM (yeah right) or log in another character and get the attention of an online GM (yeah right).<br><br>I have confirmation from an EQ guide that this bug is real and Verant does know about it. Will they do anything about it? Haven't the foggiest. Until then, be careful out there. <br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem946608733,36916,"></a>

Origin is now tracking and banning anyone who tries to use the "using two scrolls" bug. One person claims they tested it once just to see if it still works (it doesn't) and was banned the next morning.<br><br>Details are in <a href="http://www.lunarden.com/ubb/Forum6/HTML/002164.html">this thread</a>.<br><br>Again, <b>do not try to replicate this bug. Your account will be banned.</b><br><br>This is a new procedure for UO -- not only fixing a bug, but tracking down and banning those who try to use it afterwards.

Brad McQuaid, Everquest's designer, posted the <a href="http://www.deja.com/[ST_rn=ap]/getdoc.xp?AN=565566178&fmt=text">following response</a> to questions of eBay sales:<br><br><font color=#77FF77">> Just sell players the items.

Roebin Soultaker, KEG's favorite warrior, sent this in to me. While it doesn't actually refer to KEG as he alluded (and in fact, as several KEGgers pointed out, most of what drops on the dragons and planes is no-drop anyway. Oh, and Roebin also sent in several screenshots of a KEG member telling him they accepted master card or visa for efreeti boots. Roebin is somewhat unfamiliar with what you or I call sarcasm, and thinks that I haven't posted it because I want to join KEG. I am not making this up.) it does show that SOMEONE is making a good living at this stuff.<br><br>If Verant has any moral compass whatsoever, they will abandon all pretense of a player-based economy at higher levels and simply make all unique magic items nodrop. Anything else is simply surrendering to the kind of corruption described in the folio below.<br><br>The following was sent, apparently by accident, to someone who doesn't even play on that server (a pretty new one, The Tribunal)<br><br><font color=#77FF77>Hello Everquest Fanatic,<br><br>Thank you for your enquiry for Items and Platinum on The Tribunal server.<br><br>Today's update to the item list adds another couple of nice items, most notably a Mithril 2Hand Sword, the ultimate 2Hand weapon. I  expect these to sell by tomorrow night (I have 2 available, and I  know they will :)<br><br>Other nice additions:<br><br>        Brown Chittin Protector<br>        Djarn's Amethyst Ring<br>        Wolf Fur Slippers<br><br>I could not believe the demand for the Executioner's axes and  although I dont have one on the list, I expect to have one for sale sometime over the next few days. Let me know if you are interested. I also have a Flowing Black Silk Sash (haste sash) and I am looking for around $600 for this. Call if interested.<br><br>As usual, a couple of things to note:<br><br>1. First in best dressed. The item list is quite extensive but  quantities are most definitely limited.<br><br>2. We do not item hunt. What is on the list is what we have for  sale. We will be adding items to the list and sending out the  update on a regular basis. We are not taken special requests at  this time (although if you tell me you want to pay $1500 for a nice Shiny Metallic Robe we will reconsider =).<br><br>3. $150 minimum order. That is the minimum amount we will service and that can constitute items and/or platinum pieces.<br><br>Our current rate for platinum is:<br> <br>        1000pp for $140 USD    OR    $14 for 100pp<br><br>For example, you might want a Crasted Breastplate ($125) and some platinum. We would then supply you with the BP and around 200pp for $150 minimum amount. Our stock of platinum was very low but luckily enough for you, we have replenished it again.<br><br>For larger orders, we will offer a nice quantity discount, call for more information.<br><br>If you wish to purchase items and/or platinum, there are 3 ways:<br><br>1. Phone<br><br>You can call me direct at (503) 524-6666 anytime from 4:00pm through  12:00 Midnight Pacific Time. We can take care of the transaction while you are on the phone.<br><br>2. Email<br><br>Simply email me the following information and I will send you a tell  online as soon as I have the transaction processed:<br><br>        Your real name<br>        Credit Card number<br>        Credit Card expiration date<br>        Character name<br>        The approximate location of your character (eg. Freeport, etc)<br>        Items/Number of platinum pieces you require<br><br>3. Western Union<br><br>I also accept Western Union. You can send the money to:<br><br>        Paul Sinclair<br>        Tigard, OR, 97223<br><br>Please call me before and confirm the items/platinum you wish to  purchase. I will hold the items for 24 hours. Once you have the control number, either call or email me and once I confirm the money  is there, I will contact you in game and we can do the transfer immediately.<br><br>Some people could not open the attached excel spreadsheet last update so I am sending out this weeks update in 3 forms, Excel 2000, Excel 95 and a plain text version.<br><br>If you have any questions, please send me a message. I really want to  stress that privacy is an important factor to me and I will ensure any transaction we make is strictly confidential.<br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>Paul<br><br>PS: I run a small Internet consulting business and I operate various websites.

Sunsword had a late night last night fixing the house exploit.<br><br><font color=#77FF77>I'm sorry that I haven't been here to post about this earlier. I'm actually "on vacation" so I had a hard time getting permission to post as "SunSword" from a remote site. Anyway, I've put in some preventions that stop anyone from redeeding a house or transferring it for a short time. Once all the servers go down from maintenance and come back up, all house functions should resume, but the exploit should be gone. We apologize for the harm the exploiters caused.<br><br>I did learn some interesting things fixing the problem though, and will be able to apply it to all new game systems.<br><br>I hope you are having an otherwise happy and safe holiday!</font><br><br>And, on an interesting note, here's his response to a request for more info:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">As you probably guessed, I can't comment much on how it worked.<br><br>I can, however, tell you that I believed I have solved the problem and we will all be monitoring very closely.

I was afraid this was what was happening. There is apparently a nasty house exploit out there that allows people to instadecay houses. Origin has rolled back Pacific to 12/24. I've heard several reports that houses in Sonoma have been instadecayed as well. Here's the word from OSI:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Due to a house exploit we have had to revert the Pacific Shard to late in the evening Christmas Eve. The seriousness of this exploit has also required us to disable several of the house commands on all shards. The features we disabled that will be most obvious are the ability to demolish a house and re-deed it, and the ability to transfer ownership of a house. Once we are sure we have resolved this issue with houses we will turn these features back on. If you have any information about this exploit we encourage you to send a message to protect-uo@owo.com com . We are very sorry we have had to revert the server and the inconvenience this has caused.</font><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem946403576,76173,"></a>

Those of you EQ players who felt all smug and superior over the KoC/Tradespot fiasco can stop now. Here's an excerpt from a posting over on EQVault. <br><br>While I have no evidence that what he says is true in this particular instance, every EQ player knows that item farming for EBay sales in EQ is a problem, and every EQ player knows that the powergaming 50th level asshole guilds are a problem on every server (I left Veeshan because I was sick and tired of them; at least on Lanys T'Whatever the powergamers are only 20th level). It isn't much of a stretch to put two and two together...<br><br><font color="#77FF77">You know, as I was inquiring about KEG to KEG members I never dreamed of hearing what I heard was going on in your guild. One of your members told me that KEG makes 5K (That's 5 grand) a month selling items on Ebay or by other means. I confirmed it by asking a few KEG members about buying certain items and was informed that I could purchase them with VISA, Mastercard, or Discover 24/7. I did the best I could to choose a very difficult item to get to see how they would respond, and remarkably I was told that any item could be gotten for me by KEG. I was told that all major spawn areas could be camped on a moments notice by KEG and most were already being done so 24/7. Well since I had been to some of these areas myself I thought it couldn't be true, but sure enough there were either KEG members there camping the same items day after day after day, or as I was told by an eccentric KEG member, "We have level 50 accounts without guildtags so that KEG still gets the items but people think it isn't KEG camping them". This is also true for the Nagafen raids. Tagless high-level characters from KEG take the loot and return it to KEG, totally deceiving the other players who are used on a daily basis to feed KEG's monopoly and cash sale of EQ items to other players. I mean, since KEG is monoplozing spawn areas, then the only obvious solution to getting an item is to buy it. I think that Verant is on to them in this regard because my surveillance of Ebay has shown that auctions there have remarkably decreased recently (KEG auctioners). But for example, one Mithril 2H sword sold for $850.00!! And Haste Sash's are selling for $500.00! So you can see there is an interest in not letting other players have a crack at those items simply because it breaks into KEG's market. And this is done simply by camping 24/7 and harrassing, intimidating and isolating those players that object to what is going on. <br><br>Now it isn't my opinion that characters shouldn't be sold; I mean if an account is yours then by all means it is your intellectual property and that is between you and Verant. But to camp items day after day after day while not allowing other persons playing EQ the opportunity to do so is really troubling. If you disagree I would like to hear your explanation. But then again, in order to make 5 grand a month you guys must be camping all types of items. You have to admit that. And just the fact that your people openly brag about it on the servers is outrageous. <br><br>Then there is the really sad state of affairs by a growing (very quickly) list of individuals who dislike you. Many have said that your guild harasses them in the game when they protest some of the things I have mentioned above. That, in itself, is poor manners. Come to think of it I had (yet another) an encounter with an individual from KEG last night when I was zoning out of Sol B and attempted to exit the narrow corridor leaving the zone. The Troll that was standing there wouldn't move and I asked him to move and he told me to say "please". Then another KEG person said "That is Roebin. He is the player whose EQ world is getting smaller by the day." <br><br>So I have to bring this up. Do you honestly believe that you control EQ? Are you out of your minds? Do you ask your guild members to harrass players in the game who slight you in even the smallest way? I am convinced that you do. </font><br><br>The full post (this was only an excerpt) is <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5038146&ffv=1">here</a>.<br><br>KEG's website is <a href="http://www.everquester.com/">here</a>.<br><br>John Smedley's email address is <a href="mailto:jsmedley@verant.com">here</a>.<br><br>I want to be <a href="http://www.travelbelize.org/">here</a>.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem946402872,44075,"></a>

Just in case you think we hate PKers in UO (we love them, especially when crunchy in milk), here's a note about a PK guild on Chesapeake that somehow managed to survive the Hammerfall holocaust.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I have been following/watching the large player killer guild J-D (Juevos del Diablo "Balls of the Devil") for well over a year now.  They are far and away the largest PK guild I know of in UO, and the funny thing is they are well liked.  They just go about their business, avoid all trash talking and harrassment, and for the most part play with honor.  Their leader is Alice Cooper (I saw a letter posted on your site from him recently) and over a year ago he set a goal of 2000 murders by the year 2000.  He hit that original goal early and changed it to 3000 by 2000, stating that he doubted he could do it.  Well, last night he broke that 3000 mark (I will attach a screen shot from the bounty board).  I have no idea how 3000 kills compares to other shards, and like I said I don't know if you feel it is newsworthy or not.  I just think with all the negative things that have happened to PK guilds (MDK, KoC) this makes a statement that the PK is not dead, and under the right leadership with the right players a PK guild can still survive in UO.  You  should take a look at their <a href="http://members.aol.com/mephjdd/uo.html">guild website</a> for more information and lots of screen shots of them in action.</font><p align=center><img src="http://lum.xrgaming.net/3000B.jpg"></p><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem946323446,19119,"></a>

Our Roving Rogue Reporter from Siege Perilous, Thunderlips, writes in with this:<p align=center><img src="http://lum.xrgaming.net/house.jpg"></p><font color="#77FF77">An interesting turn of events.  I have a friend by destard who lets me hang out and mine at his house once in a while.  I was pked a few times while mining and that kinda peved me; why these guys waste 100gp in regs to steal a shovel is beyond me.  Anyhow, I started to carry around a house deed with me.  There is so much room on SP, I can place a house when I'm attacked an instalog (Note: this has actually only worked twice).<br><br>Anyhow, I was jumped by some homo-red out for my shovel and I ran inside Destard (maybe a dragon will get us both!).  Out of curiousity I placed a house inside.  The Gods of Shovel Keeping must have been with because here it is (pic).  If you want to see it personally, you better hurry, I doubt the house will last through the day.  Some guilds claim to "own" a dungeon, I have my name on it so Bleah! <br><br>Sage Thunderlips, The Ultimate Male</font><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem946306618,83504,"></a>

While everyone else was sleeping, drinking heavily, powerleveling newbie characters on the new EQ server, or all of the above (my personal choice for the holiday festivities) those loveable UO Dev Gnomes actually went and posted some planned changes. Let's get right to it, shall we?<br><br><font color="#77FF77"><b>Latest Update</b></font> <i>stuff that already went in on the 21st that you missed entirely</i><br><br><font color="#77FF77">Holiday Tickets Activated.</font> whee.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">NPCs will no longer scavenge items. <br>Monsters will no longer destroy objects that block their path. This is a temporary change and will be changed back. </font><br><br>Uh... guys? There's this thing called a Test Center. You may want to try out your nifty pathfinding ideas there first before setting them loose on the shards and then threatening to ban folks when they take advantage of your l33t on-the-fly code testing. Grow a brain, grow a clue, just grow!<br><br><font color="#77FF77">You will no longer be able to place locked down items into your backpack.</font><br><br>Well shit. That sounded like it would have been fun. Hah! Try to steal my fish steaks NOW!<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The exploit that allowed people to gain magic resistance using blade spirits without taking damage from the blade spirits has been fixed.</font><br><br>Of course, you can still gain resist off of blade spirits, especially when a notoPK runs into yours and shoves a few flamestrikes up your butt. Very cost-effective way of gaining resist, actually. (I recommend the Brit graveyard for this.)<br><br><font color="#77FF77"><b>In Development</b></font> <i>stuff that is being worked on that you have very little time left to bitch and caterwaul about</i><br><br><font color="#77FF77">The bug involving the ability to &#8220;pre-cast&#8221; spells and then use or take items will be fixed.</font><br><br>Picture a dead horse, a whip, and a grinning dominatrix with a death fetish. I think pretty much everyone who has ever raised a sword in anger in UO against another has said one thing or another about this. Personally I happen to think that if all you get out of UO is firing off your precasting macros in a robotic fashion, it's time to find a new game anyway. But that's just me. Others will tell you that without precasting UO is no longer actually technically a game.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Monsters in invalid or unreachable locations will &#8220;die&#8221; after a certain amount of time.</font><br><br>About goddam time. Of course, if Raph Koster's virtual lifecycle economy was left in those monsters stuck up a tree or something would die anyway. Then again the players would probably have reverted to cannibalism by now, too. Oh, that's right, they did that last year until the human jerky was removed. D'oh!<br><br><font color="#77FF77">To avoid exploits involving &#8220;gray&#8221; to &#8220;blue&#8221; flagging, entering or being the target of combat will extend the &#8220;gray flag&#8221; of a &#8220;gray&#8221; character for two additional minutes.<br><br>The fealty calculation for guildstones will be made more efficient to alleviate the delay in shard start-up times.</font><br><br>Whatever. This is all stuff that should have been done, oh, two years ago.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">NPCs will now train the appropriate skills when asked. Some NPCs will now train different skills than they previously and will list all skills they can train when asked, &#8220;train&#8221; <br>You will no longer get the item &#8220;a scroll&#8221;. <br>Monster treasure will be revamped. Most monsters will not carry backpacks, and some monsters will carry different treasure than they have previously. <br>Provisioners, beekeepers, and innkeepers will sell beeswax. <br>Some NPCs will now carry items more appropriate to their jobs (beware of merchants with trapped boxes!)</font><br><br>How long have they been promising to get rid of "a scroll"? What, is that Lord British's pet object or something? "Oh shit, Garriott's back in the room, put a scroll back in."<br><br>Beeswax? Can we summon bees with it? Can we stack it in huge piles to the sun? Can we... oh, never mind. I'm just glad those merchants can finally break para like the rest of us.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Pack horses will have their carrying capacity increased from 400 to 1,600 stones. If a pack horse goes wild, it will eventually drop whatever it is carrying if it is not retamed. </font><br><br>And miners everywhere went "Hot damn!". Shortly thereafter they went "please don't kill my damn packhorse".<br><br><font color="#77FF77">A new item will allow you to survey land to see if a house will fit in that location. </font><br><br>So, um, instead of shit that would actually be USEFUL, like, say, secure house transferral or housing auctions or reasonable house maintenance or any of the other crap about housing that has been promised approximately since Jesus, we get a fucking surveyor's tool. Well goddam. Now all those people camped out in front of the houses of people who got banned waiting for the GMs to illegally delete them will have it easier. I know that makes me all warm and tingly inside.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">A fix for the exploit involving banning summoned pets or creatures so they will attack passersby. <br>An issue with trading and using ingots through trade windows will be resolved. <br>You will not be able to snoop pack animals inside a house, while the animal was outside. </font><br><br>Odd, that Origin is fixing bugs, despite Dr. TwisTer's departure from UO. I mean, whouldathunkit.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">You will no longer be able to use the stealing skill to determine if someone is in the thieves&#8217; guild. </font><br><br>So, while your thief may be completely fucking nerfed into the ground clear into the earth's crust, at least people can't steal with their skill locked 0 stealing to see if they can kill you at will. I guess that would count as an improvement.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Issues with smithing difficulty being higher than normal will be resolved.</font><br><br>An ideal resolution would be "fixing it".<br><br><font color="#77FF77">In an effort to allow more players to store animals on stable masters, and to cut down on the hoarding of rare and difficult-to-find animals, stable masters will be going through the <a href="http://update.uo.com/design_68.html">following revisions</a>:</font><br><br>One of those revisions of course, is not "preventing gimp tailors from gangbanging reds with 9,003 dragons". That would be wrong. I mean, whenever I think of huge, hulking red dragons snorting fire and eating maidens, I always think of them being at some dork's beck and call. It's historically accurate, right?<br><br>However, in order to balance things, dragons will be allowed to pre-cast.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem946295772,21708,"></a>

...that must be how the UO dev team must feel right now -- in the aftermath of Calandryll's latest <a href="http://update.uo.com/">infoburst</a> the UO community is going "uh... what?" in unison.<br><br>For the PvP inclined among you, the removal of pre-casting is THE topic. Most PvPers are deadset against it. I'm not. Then again, I never use it, so I'm biased. However, most folks say that allowing mages to pre-cast are the only way that duels can be fought... otherwise dex monkeys will chew up the mages. Of course this is a symptom of the larger problem, namely that combat is limited to two archetypes (dex monkey and mage) and is about to be limited to one (dex monkey) among the hardcore PvP mavens. <br><br>I'm personally convinced that a fireteam with well-defined roles (healers, nukers and tanks) SHOULD be able to defeat anyone. That's how it worked in our glory days on GL, dammit. However in practice combat almost always devolves to who gets there the fustest with the mostest. Then again you can pretty much say the same thing about war in general. <br><br>Pretty much the only real answer to the problem is to make a completely revamped combat system with so many interlocking skills that there is no one true way to mastery. Of course that may as well be a <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/">seperate game</a>.<br><br>Turning from PvP to, um, not PvP, another change announced was item decay on boats. In other words, items will decay on boats. Buh-bye, mining barges. Which I suspect is the point. I mean, if you mine, you should be at risk from h0 dA pIMpSlaSHER killing you. Happened all the time in Medieval Europe, right? And the best part of Ultima 9 was when you got to run down the Minoc coastline laying waste to all the miners.

Someone posted the following to the UO onelist, which originally appeared on an Austrailan-UO message base:<br><br><font color=#77FF77>I rang EA in Queensland just then and they are rolling the red carpet on what will be a mammoth occasion, as they announce the opening og the Oceania server on January 10th. This news will be officially announced on New Year's Day at 5PM AEST by Origin. They said that with the official announcements only coming direct from Origin themselves rather than EA. They also said with the official announcements people will be able to buy UO Game Time cards at a discount through the month of January. They said the price is unknown. The dummy boxes of the [special Australian version of UO, the] Discovery Edition are already in some Harvy Norman stores and they do look presentable... similar to the Ultima Ascension box. They said the server is most likely to be based in Melbourne and will give Australia a wide berth [assuming they mean Australians only can log in --Lum], with New Zealand to follow 5 days later, Singapore 10 days after NZ and the rest of the world at the end of February.

Quite a few updates to the In Dev and In Concept pages, including some long needed ones such as guildstone retooling and monster spawn sanity checking.

I know quite a few "PvP **EXPERTS**" insist that precasting is part of the game and if it's removed that PvP will somehow become more lame or something.

The first one Allen Grey of <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/">CoD</a> clued me in on.

Someone who was investigated by OSI and vindicated of wrong doing sent me the two letters he was sent. Sheds a bit of life on what they're doing.<br><br><font color="#ff77ff">On December 16th your account was suspended due on confirmation of it being associated with one or more accounts of verified exploiters. On further review into the case, we have determined that the action related to the account in question had little to no bearing on the actual exploits or the results of the exploits. As such your account will be immediately reactivated.<br><br>As the nature of the exploits resulted in the termination of scores of accounts, I do hope that you can understand our position and why we were forced to suspend the account. Neither Origin Systems nor Electronic Arts have any desire to do business with those who continually break the Terms of Service and Rules of Conduct. The terminated accounts were removed from the service because of multiple infractions, and to ensure the integrity of the Ultima Online service, this was a necessary act.<br><br>I ask that you please be careful in any future dealings with suspect individuals or accounts. You are a constructive member of the UO community with no prior incidents, and I have to say that I am pleased to see that the account was cleared. However, please know that had any additional incidents turned up, this account likely would not have been reactivated.<br><br>Moving forward, your houses on the Chesapeake shard have been transferred to an OSI character. To regain ownership of the houses, please enter the game at your convenience and page a Game Master with each respective house owner to have it transferred back to you. <br><br>I apologize for any inconveniences caused by this, but am also glad that we have been able to resolve this matter. Should any problem arise with this, please let me know. It is now our desire that you be able to resume your UO activities as soon as possible.<br><br>Thank you for your time and patience,<br>(name of individual deleted to spare his mailbox)<br>Ultima Online Player Relations<br>Origin Systems, Inc.</font><br><br>And this letter, in response to inquiring after someone else who only logged on to refresh houses:<br><br><font color="#77ff77">We are reviewing each case as it is requested. However please know that we are not terminating any accounts whatsoever without a cause. In each case that we are forced to close an account, there is very good reason to do so. If the account is clean, or on review it is found that there were no<br>problems with it, then by all means we reinstate them. Regarding the accounts you mention below, they also will be reviewed in depth again to make sure no mistakes were made.<br><br>As for the warning about associating with others, it is vital to<br>understand that if you are found to have access to someone's account which is clearly violating the Terms of Service, you can be and most likely will be also held responsible. As a service, it is impossible to attempt to determine which individuals might be innocent and which might be guilty on an account that is in breach of the TOS. As such we must terminate those accounts in order to protect the service. Thusly it is highly recommended that you log in on your accounts only and not allow others to access your account. <br> <br>I am glad that we were able to do this for you. We will continue the<br>review process for the other accounts as soon as possible. Thank you for your time,<br><br>(name of individual deleted to spare his mailbox)<br>Ultima Online Player Relations<br>Origin Systems, Inc.</font><br><br>And, the person who sent me these letters has this to say about the subject:<br><br><font color="#77ff77">I should also point out to all the OSI haters that I sent this mail about noon on Sunday, and reveived a reply only an hour or two later.  On a broader note, this whole episode sure has brought out the worst in human nature on both sides of the fence, as has been evident to anyone CoB discussions or on kTalk.  Obviously some innocents were drawn into this, who knows how many when it's all said and done.  The fact that this fellow answered my letter on a Sunday tells me that OSI IS working, overtime no less, to get innocents back into the game.  I'm not thrilled about the way OSI went about things, but it would seem that they are trying to make the game better due to a mess caused by a small group of players.  I'm not a big fan of guilt by association.  I can tell you from being on the receiving end that it's not a pleasant experience.  Somewhere between "GMs must witness an offense to take action against a player" and "OSI will mass ban many based on the actions of a few" is a desirable level of customer service and TOS enforcement.  Hopefully OSI will find it one day soon.</font><br><br>Considering that UO2 is coming out soon, we'd hope so.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem945710020,55503,"></a>

Here are the facts. <br><br>Some folks were duping. Some other folks were carting said duped money to Siege to start new characters. Still other folks sold said duped money on eBay. Origin basically banned everyone primarily, secondarily, tertiarily, and quadrilarily involved. In other words if you breathed the same virtual air as a duper, you were history.<br><br>Here is what I think of this great big clusterfuck.<br><br>I am so fucking sick of hearing from self-righteous PKs who think that their miner killing is some sort of goddam political statement. You are what we like to call "lame assholes". There is very little glory in being a "lame asshole". You're not even really all that unique. You're just, as I said, a "lame asshole". Maybe when Diablo II comes out you can get Townkill 6.0 and fuck with people there. Until then content yourself with traning spectres on newbies in Oasis or something.<br><br>If I get another email from someone which basically says "there was no way they could have caught me because I'm too smart and besides everyone else does it" I'm going to go medieval on someone. I know this is a grade A newsflash to some folks, but you do not have a constitutional right to play UO. And when you are busted for being an Xpl0iT kiddie, it is not a human rights violation. Sorry. <br><br>To everyone who's going around saying "Lum sold out", you can bite my lily white ass TWO times. My sincerest apologies to those who think that any opinion other than yours is somehow wrong. You have a bright future ahead of you in organized religion. Go forth, be fruitful and multiply. I'm sure at some point some smurf will screw up in public and I'll be numbah one on your personal hit parade again. Till then, buh bye.<br><br>To everyone who's all smug and pleased with themselves that your personal enemies got magically wiped from the planet, just ask yourself if you trust every single person in your guild with your UO future. Because they have the power to destroy it.<br><br>And to OSI, individual banning letters would not have been that goddam hard. And an explanation to the community would ESPECIALLY not have been that goddam hard. Right now, basically all anyone who doesn't read sleazy rant sites knows is that Origin banned 200 accounts for no apparent reason.

First of all my characters are    basically nobodies. I am not a Pker nor am I a very good PvPer. I don't have    endless wealth, and I am not an exploiter.&nbsp; Yes I macro, but not    unattended, even with that my best character is a 4X GM.&nbsp; I play UO as    a wonderful stress relief and enjoy the many friends I have made over the    last 2+ years.&nbsp; I am not a member of KOC, but was in the guild LOV.&nbsp;    Regardless of what people may think of LOV, I believe it was basically made    up of decent people like myself who enjoyed the game for the game. I fully    support the OSI position of banning persons who violate the TOS, but only    with indisputable proof of those violations. Unfortunately OSI has taken    another route. Guilt by association, and even that is shaky.&nbsp; My    accounts were banned in the latest round and I was truly dumbfounded. I    wrote a letter to OSI stating that I thought there was some type of mistake    thinking surely it would be cleared up, but they again insisted that in    there own words:</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;We have reviewed your account as per your request. It is clear    that there is a connection between your account and accounts verified to be    associated with exploits. After assessing what was found, it is necessary    that this account remain closed to protect the Ultima Online service.&quot;</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now the only thing that I can think that may have caused such a finding was    that I bought an account on Ebay last September.&nbsp; It was a modest    account and the only real reason I bought it was that I wanted a large    house. Since all the land in Chessy was already occupied, this seemed to be    the only way to get a large house.&nbsp; The only assumption that I can make    is that one of the characters on that account was involved in some sort of    activities that violated the TOS.&nbsp; So now I am gone from the game. An    interesting side note is that my brother who also plays UO was banned for    being associated with me (or so we believe). We shared accounts and often    logged onto each other accounts to help with various activities. It's just a    game so I will move on, but not without feeling like I have been gravely    mistreated. One of your other editorials stated that if 200 accounts got    banned that it only represented 0.1% of all accounts. He also suggested that    that made it OK.&nbsp; At what percentage is it not OK? 1%? 5%? 10%? The    point is that anytime a single person is mistreated, it should never be OK.&nbsp;    It's only .1% this time. What about next time? And there will be a next    time. I'm done fighting with OSI because I don't have the resources or    energy to continue to battle with them and everything I worked for will be    long gone before any resolution will be made.&nbsp; I want to warn other    that may be looking at buying an account or already have. Be very careful.    If you buy, only buy property or be VERY sure you know the previous owners    of the account. If it happened to me, it can, did, and will happen to    others...</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">      Enigma / Zeus ex UO enthusiast.    &nbsp;</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">...We have sent each other money, paid for accounts, we are a group of  friends. And if OSI bans me, im glad that i went out with a KoC tag above my  head, its pride. It may only be a game but we took pride that we never backed  down from a war. That we never wavered when everyone banded against us (AFC).  That was a huge guild made from 12 or so other guilds made to fight us. We  took pride in who we were, and im sorry OSI, i grew up in Uo 3 years ago, i  didnt change my style of play and i never  will. I played to kill and i played for my friends. If these things are  against the rules now and im a 'problem player' so be it. Im now an  unacceptable part of the Uo community, oh well, the game I learned to love and  play was alot different and I didnt change and conform...</font>   <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">... We are the power gamers, the people that play to fight and kill. Dont  get me wrong i mean people in KoC had pax citizens, people had mules and  craftsman. But we all shared a common bond and that was to kill people, we all  loved to war..</font></p>  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">...A lot of you will say good riddance and its ironic, most of you i dont  know, most of you dont know me. We simply killed you at some time, or you were  denied entrance into KoC or we did something to 'rub you the wrong way'. Or  maybe you are close minded and dont see the need for an 'evil' presence in Uo.  But again, its the way i learned to play Uo, and im glad that i didnt change  my play style...</font></p>      <font face="Verdana" size="2">      ...So goodbye OSI, i wont tread on your shards again, not because i cant,    but because its not the same game i started playing. And its point less,    point less when all your friends decided that they dont want to pay this    company any more money.....even though they were not banned, they just dont    want to do it, and niether do i. So for all of you KoC haters maybe this    explained a little of who we were and why.....if you still dont know then i    cannot help you. But for once all i ask is put down the labels of 'cheater'    'exploiter' and realize that what has happend here can happen anytime..</font>    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You are one of 150 thousand and loosing your account doesnt matter to    OSI. As an OSI employee told me recently &quot;You play on our machines, you    pay us 9.95 to use our equipment, we can ban you because we dont like    you&quot;....end of story. They are right of course, they have the right to    weed out the 'undesirables' i guess i just figured that customer service    still existed, it does around here, and everywhere i have worked the slogan    is &quot;The customer is always right&quot;.

Got this from Alice Cooper, guildmaster of J-D:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">When I read your "opinion" of the recent  bannings,  I was truly shocked.  I am not trying to tell you that KoC are choirboys, because they definately are not.  Their style of play is to have others fear and hate them, simular to MDK but to a lesser extent.  I cannot comment on KoC explioting, duping or any DoS activity because I have never witnessed any KoC member doing anything like that.  What I have witnessed in my 2.5 years of playing UO is KoC PKing, House looting, looting, stealing, trash talking,  new rez killing, etc.(I was new rez'd killed 6x in a row recently by them, and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves).  Generally speaking they don't show any non-KoC in the game any respect.  These things <br>Origin considers "anti-social", and i'm sure OSI recieves many complaints about them, but they are not a violation of the TOS.  The problem is, as far as I see it, OSI is getting tired of hearing constant complaints about certain players and guilds, and they think they can solve the problem and make the majority of the UO population happy by banning people/guilds.  I'm not saying that some members of KoC didnt deserve to get banned,  but blanket banning an entire guild (ala MDK) is just wrong and unfair.  And you comparing them to Nazi's isn't right either Lum.  What the Nazi's did is a real thing, Ultima Online is just a game.</font><br><br>As I stated in the kTalk response before someone decided to exercise their 3l33t DoS skiLlZ, I did not say, or even imply that KoC were Nazis. I simply said that anyone who asserted that they joined KoC without knowing what kind of guild they were was being silly. Just as everyone knew what sort of party the Democrats are (to use a less emotionally charged phrase), everyone who wanted to join KoC knew what they were joining.<br><br>As for the principle of collective banning. As I said when MDK was banned, I disagree with it. I don't think it's good policy to blanket ban a guild based on its member's actions. However, Origin has shown now again that they can and will do this. If you are in a guild that exploits, or has a tolerance of exploiters, it may be a good idea to say those magic words, "I resign from my guild".<br><br>I think the nature of KoC had a great deal to do with the blanket ban. Judging from the banning letters we've seen, Origin is treating KoC as a guild that exploited en masse, and "innocent" members were banned simply for belonging. That is unfortunate. That is wrong. Assuming there were "innocent" members, a matter I think is still up for debate. It looks like a lot of these so-called "innocents" are saying, once all the self-justification is parsed out of the way, "I didn't do anything - sure a lot of my friends cheated and duped, but *I PERSONALLY* didn't, so I shouldn't be banned." <br><br>We don't know the facts here. No one is coming forward and saying "Yeah, I did this, I should be banned." So either Origin just got a corn cob up their butt and banned a bunch of folks they didn't like for no apparent reason, or (and for some reason I consider this more likely, maybe I'm an Origin Pod Person now) Origin actually found evidence of some wrong doing among at least some of the folks who were banned. The point is, we really have no idea for sure. So those saying everyone banned were innocent lambs led to the slaughter, and those saying that Origin didn't ban ENOUGH people and they should just go ban everyone not using the Elizabethan-to-English Transerv filter, are both wrong.<br><br>At this point, that's about the only thing we do know. Other then that KoC sure likes posting on my site now.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem945574174,3415,"></a>

The fallout from Hammerfall continues. Early this morning KoC's castle was deleted by the GMs. Our first perspective comes from a post by Calista on our <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum1/HTML/001320.html">message board</a> and addresses this, from an outsider's viewpoint.<br><br><font color="7777AA">Another one of my best friends, the guildmaster of Chessie UTB. He had all his characters friended to the castle. He co-owned the castle, and was the ONLY one co-ownered to the castle. Everything he ever earned including his phoenix armour and statues from the ticket system as well as the rares he got from 2 years of playing UO were in that castle. But because the owner of the castle was banned, the GMs decided to clear the entire friends list and co-owners list. He e-mailed support, he e-mailed concerns, he e-mailed the dev members, pleading for the chance to get everything he ever owned (besides the gold in the bank) from the castle. At 3AM today, the GMs deleted it.<br><br>They deleted it, but left everything outside to all the looters. Xavier was able to get there in time but was killed and as a ghost, got to watch a bunch of $#&)(@$#ING looters who weren't banned loot EVERYTHING he ever owned, every rare he ever collected, every single statue and piece of phoenix armour which he spent so much time and items and gold to get from the ticket system and would probably never be able to get, again.<br><br>Farewell, Xavier. Farewell to one of the best truest friends I've ever had in UO. He and I trusted each other so much that he gave me a character slot on his account and I friended that character to my house and gave that character a set of the house keys fully knowing that Xavier would never loot me and I would never steal from the other characters.<br><br>For the first time in my 2 years of being addicted to this crack, I'm thinking about quitting.</font><br><br>The second perspective, from a player on Chesapeake not involved in the bannings.<br><br><font color="7777AA">I've heard reverences to this as "an outrage", as "Gestapo tactics" and worse.  In truth, this is almost a non-event.  Realize that 200 accounts out of 135,000 is roughly .15%.  This impacts suprisingly few accounts.  I was expecting much worse after reading the first reports.  If OSI were to ever truly become aggressive with exploiters, macroers, etc this number would be in the thousands.  Maybe 10's of thousands.  For heaven's sake, I can walk around a busy shard and see 200 people macroing in the course of 6 hours.<br><br>Basically, these were the "worst of the worst", the most notorious and nefarious of the exploiters, etc and their close associates.  Some of those banned may not have participated directly in the illegal activities, but are certainly guilty by association.  Just because I didn't help my friend rob the liquor store doesn't mean I can hold the money for him with no ramifications.<br><br>Also, I am a bit surprised by how most posters on message boards and forums belittle and mock OSI's technical expertise.  The posters apparently think that OSI's technical people must have just a vague understanding of what the internet is, how it works, and what IPs, logs, and audit trails are all about.  These "stupid" technical people maintain a system of almost 20 servers and handle accounting, connectivity, and data integrity for 135,000 people (minus 200 now, of course).  Yes, I am sure these people are much too ignorant to understand IP cycling, leases, and masking.<br><br>This really annoys me.  People are welcome to their opinion on the UO staff's motivations, but it seems foolish to me to call their technical ability into question.  Most of those spouting about how "stupid" the OSI technicians are claim to be "experts" themselves, alluding to their own vast knowledge of networking.  All of you system engineers go back to maintaining that 20 person network at your office.  Good job.  We're very impressed.  If OSI would just listen to you....<br><br>Even if you assume for a moment that OSI's people were NOT capable of tracking down these people, how difficult would it be for one of the largest game manufacturers in the country to go out and hire a capable consulting firm to do it for them?<br><br>In my opinion, what you have here is an extremely vocal, yet tiny sliver of the UO population that has with 99.9% certainty been engaging in all manner of illegal (as per the TOS) activity.<br><br>And don't get me started on the lawsuit.  I'm sure that the corporate lawyers working for EA/OSI et al are just as ignorant as their technicians. Of course the TOS doesn't apply to 14 year old "elite" players. *rolls eyes again*</font><br><br>Speaking of the <a href="http://www.clan-eld.com/zak/banned.htm">lawsuit</a>, the third perspective is a lawyer's view of their case.<br><br><font color="7777AA">Pathetic.  I think that they misfiled the "Idiot's Guide to the Law" in the comic book section again.  I'll have to give the ol' librarian another shock across the chest with a car battery and wake her up.<br> <br>That is frightening.  The short version, as I'm sure you know, is that notwithstanding Origin's reservation of the right to ban anyone any time for any reason..., this loser ADMITS violating the ToS.  So, in the unlikely event Origin is not actually allowed to ban anyone at any time for any reason, certainly they can ban for violations of the ToS.  (As an attorney that graduated from a top 10 law school, I still for the life of me don't know what a "breech of contract" is.  Is it a contract written backwards, or maybe some sort of pants or leggings for hire?)<br> <br>Geez, Gomer, I don't guess I woulda admitted anything in my letter to them ther OSI people.<br> <br>"Let us be clear of this. I've violated no terms to the point of being banned. "  (emphasis added).<br> <br>Whaddya say, OSI, should we let this guy back in because he only duped a small stone keep deed and not a castle deed?<br> <br>*shakes head*<br> <br>For sake of argument, do you realize what he's asking for for damages?  Virtually NUTHIN!  He said he played for 3 years, that's 360 bucks, round to 400 if you consider the cost of the game.  Times 300, being generous?  That's $120K.  No offense, and this may sound crass, but you can't even hire a top lawyer to handle even a moderate case for $120K if it goes to trial. I don't think OSI is shaking in their boots.</font><br><br>The fourth perspective is my own.<br><br>I'm thinking specifically of those KoC members (Hammerfall isn't a KoC-only incident, but the vast majority of those banned had ties to KoC in some way) who claim innocence. That they have never violated ToS in any way, that they've never actually broken any rules, and they were banned for no reason.<br><br>KoC's guild charter, in total, is "there are no rules." KoC's reputation to outsiders was "by any means necessary." They protected themselves in PvP - but everything else just didn't count. As one put it, you were either KoC or you weren't shit.<br><br>It is hard to see how one could join such a guild and feign innocence, although many now have.  It is hard to see how someone could actually help the game in any way while being a member of such a guild, although many now are saying their friends did exactly this.<br><br>KoC were not nice folks. They were right there at the forefront of the Roleplayer-PK war, and they made a point of making Paxlair's life miserable, on an almost daily basis, simply because they could, and, however expressed in PK argot, Paxlair's players were not only the enemy, but were lame, unworthy of being contestants, but only as cattle.<br><br>Now, this is not against the UO Terms of Service. It is not against the law to be an ass.<br><br>The Chesapeake Roleplayer-PK war has gotten especially ugly. When MDK attacked Corwyn in much the same way as KoC attacked Paxlair, it ended with MDK being banned in toto, not for being exploiters, but for basically being members of a terrorist organization; one which took the animosity in game so far out of game that the head of Corwyn basically felt herself targeted in real life. You may disagree on whether or not this was actually something valid to fear; what is not up for debate is that MDK took what began as conflict within an online game far over the line, into reality.<br><br>And now we have KoC. KoC is much larger than MDK (about 50 members total, which make up probably half of the banned accounts considering many of the accounts were multiples owned by one person) and many KoC were actually working with Paxlair. In fact, Paxlair as a group has come out against this mass banning - despite being their target over a year - because some of those who were banned were actually decent people.<br><br>Nevertheless, I have to wonder, in such an environment, how anyone truly "innocent" would join KoC. It is sort of like someone in Germany, in 1944, joining the Nazi party. I'm sure not everyone who was in the Nazi party was mass murderering fiends, either, but by that point you pretty much had a clear picture that the Nazis were not choirboys. And from all the things I'm hearing about KoC, neither were they.<br><br>The lesson learned from all this, if nothing else, is to take care with whom you associate with in game. It can, and will, come back to haunt you.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem945477918,74024,"></a>

Some of the banned are now talking <a href="http://www.clan-eld.com/zak/banned.htm">lawsuit</a>. Personally, since Origin reserves the right to boot someone for any/no reason and has since UO started it doesn't seem to have much chance, but hey, get twelve nimrods in a closed up room somewhere and you never know what might happen. <a href="http://azile.tradespot.net/">Azile</a> is telling folks to quit UO and stick it to Origin. (I guess she took my rant earlier about being able to comment on games one doesn't play to heart.)<br><br>On a happier note, some of the more obviously innocent folks who were banned got reinstated today. However none of them were from KoC, and it does seem that the entire KoC guild was blanket-banned. They get to join MDK and SUN in the Circle of Fame. <br><br>Pretty much everyone involved is spitting fireballs at me in e-mail, so I must be doing fairly well.

But you'd also be right. Just this once though. And if you're playing Torment, you're staying the goddam hell out of my way, which as the calendar moves inexorably forward is more and more important to me.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem945451455,92940,"></a>

Fact: Upwards of 200 accounts, owned by 75 to 100 people, were banned yesterday. <br><br>Fact: The bannings centered on the Chesapeake PK community. Guilds involved include (but were not limited to) KoC, -S-, J-D. Pretty much a census of PvP powerhouses on Chess.<br><br>Fact: KoC recently had several of its leadership banned for duping gold on Chess and moving it to Siege (RUMOR: via Tradespot). The character "Snooze" (RUMOR: owned by the leader of KoC) handled most of this money (RUMOR: going through Pucky of Tradespot).<br><br>Fact: Shortly thereafter, Pucky placed a castle on Siege, a feat most of the large and well-established GUILDS on Siege have not been able to manage.<br><br>Fact: Immediately before the banning, Pucky quit UO, and was trying to sell off his assets.<br><br>Fact: Immediately before the banning, both Siege Perilous and Chesapeake were taken down unexpectedly.<br><br>Those are the facts. Here, for your edification and amusement, are the most likely rumors that I've heard to explain the above.<br><br>Rumor: KoC has been working with SUN in selling duped gold created by both guilds on eBay for real-world cash.<br><br>Rumor: Tradespot has been laundering KoC/SUN duped gold on a massive scale, in order to avoid detection by OSI. This failed.<br><br>Rumor: The dupe (which OSI cannot remove due to the way the backup system works) involves creating lag. One method KoC has created lag on Chess is by mobilizing its members to try to flood the server. This worked so well that they began to crash the server whenever something they disliked occured to cause timewarps. (FACT: Chess is now the most unstable server in the game.)<br><br>Rumor: Many innocent people have been banned because of the way Origin tracked the flow of duped gold.<br><br>Fact: It's only getting uglier from here.<br><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem945448441,96382,"></a>

Seems that the FoH guild on Veeshan is in the news again. Here's a note from a confidential informant.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Kalaran/Katrak (Both level 50s and the same account) were banned from the veshaan server of everquest.  Kalaran is one of the most known and hated members of FoH, the first level 50 in final was kalaran.  Both his characters were decked out in full plane gear and god weapons.<br>  <br>Here's the strange part.  Guides can look on their private board and see the days bannings, look back on prior warnings etc.  Not one mention of Kalaran on there.  In guide chat when asked the GM-Admins say "That is something you do not need to know".  Normally Verant makes these bannings as public as possible.  Kalaran is already back, in 1 week he has a new account and a level 50 on it via spell twinking.  There is a stated edict now on veshaan "ANY GUIDE WHO SEES A PETITION AGAINST KALARANS NEW CHARACTER DROP ALL AND WATCH HIM".  They are out to get this guy.<br><br>Second strange thing is FoH will NOT disclose why he was banned.  No one outside of the higher ups at Verant and FOH know what happened.  Interesting if you ask me.<br> <br>On a side note/related story, FoH watched a japanese guild exploit the mother of all mobs, Lady Vox.  Post and pics are at  <br><br><a href="http://foh.noows.com/?forum=7&mid=5597#5597">http://foh.noows.com/?forum=7&mid=5597#5597</a><br> <br>Word on the street is Kalaran was banned for using a hack to pass no drops to newbie characters.

First the sturm und drang with who owns the Paws tavern on Pacific -- now it's actually spreading to other shards. I got this in the mail:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The player run town "The lost City of Paws" has been around for about a year on the NAPA shard. We started small and have slowly grown into one of the major mercantile spots on the shard. We began having events and gaining a community spirit. Not as an RP town but a "come as you are" place. We held to no particular values other than "You are in charge of yourself so if you make a decision deal with the consequences." About a month or so ago we were approached by a Seer on the shard and told we were a candidate for being blessed. There was much discussion about this amongst our townsfolk.<br><br>You see Lum, we arent really interested in Blessing as a goal of the town. it would be nice but, we are more interested in staying a viable community. There are examples all over our shard of "blessed" places that are now nothing but hulks of sham. Cathedral of Fire, MITH the list goes on. We didn't want to be another "Oh they used to be nice till they got blessed". However it was nice to receive some "recognition" from the OSI folks. <br><br>Now here is where it gets interesting. We were told yesterday that we cannot be blessed. The reason given was that the town does not reside where Paws is supposed to. We were given the choice of changing our name and getting blessed or not changing our name and not getting blessed. <br><br>Well now we were mad! Here we had been led on and now we get told because of a technicality that we cannot get blessed! Hmmm There are so many inconsistencies in this that we were flabbergasted. We asked if we could talk to the persons who made the decision in whatever format they desired and where told. "The decision has been made" and no further action on our part would do any good.<br><br>No here is the hard part. For those of us who frankly still dont want to be blessed, we became angry at being treated as some serf scum. As a town, we were not given the chance to argue for the town to the real decision makers. It has become clear that this issue wont get to the right ears because if it does it would make the ones who are supposed to "handle these things" look bad.<br><br>This is no longer an issue of Blessings. It has turned into an issue of a paying customer getting stonewalled by the flunky at the customer service counter. We feel like the guy getting told by the pimply faced punk that he cant do anything for us because his boss has made the decision and he knows its unfair but he needs to go to lunch so can we just leave like good little people?  (As you can see there is a lot of emotion tied to this issue.) It wouldn't be so bad if the person or persons who made the decision had come forward and been willing to talk to us about it. (yes yes I have noticed I am starting to go in circles.)</font><br><br>I trust this will not start a trend of player-run establishments coming to me to put pressure on Seers, because frankly, if you want your town "blessed" (and what is up wit' dat term anyway? Are the seers gods or merely saints channelling the blessings of the GMs? It makes my head hurt) getting it to appear on the front page of this site is probably #8,013 on the list of most effective ways to get that done. <br><br>That being said, this whole thing just seems odd. First off, is there something magical about the name "PAWS" that makes people froth and wax lyrical or something? I'd think that just changing the name to "Free City of Pawtalacks" or something would get what you wanted done, and you could still call it Paws and pretend it was an abbreviation or something. I mean, you don't exactly have "Paws" carved into stone blocks or anything. I can also see the Seers' point that having "Paws" appear south of Moonglow or something would make an Ultima purist throw a temper tantrum. <br><br>My real question, though, is what do these folks want? They've said that they don't want to be blessed, but, you know, they're mad because they couldn't discuss with decision makers about being blessed, which, by the way, they don't want. But, what the hell is being "blessed" have to do with anything? Yes, it's nice to have an IGM show up and throw nifty decorations all over everything. I was part of a player-run establishment (the Temple of Mondain on GL) that was blessed --- after about a year of lobbying and politicking. So instead of a keep that we could pretend was a temple, we had a keep with skeletons and statues that we could pretend was a temple. <br><br>It's nice when things are blessed. It adds to the atmosphere of the game. It's a win win for everyone. But for god's sake, it's not a fucking promotion, people. It's not what you get when you win. It's just tiles on the screen. And, as you alluded to from the "blessed" communities that I'll take your word on being moribund, it certainly is no replacement for a living, active community.<br><br>THAT is what is important, not whether you have the most funky tiles in your house.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem945294003,57613,"></a>

In Stormwaltz's <a href="http://staff.turbinegames.com/letoile/#latest" target="_blank">latest update</a>, he discusses a bit why banking and secure trading weren't implemented in AC.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Thus, we've come to the conclusion that when people ask for banks, they're not asking for a <i>bank</i>. That is, a safe place to put their pyreal, so they can run around unburdened. What they're asking for are <i>safety deposit boxes</i>, so they can stash their equipment in a safe location, and recover at will. In other words, they're asking for <i>houses</i>.</font><br><br>Actually, one of the things I've heard about AC is that high level chars don't actually have a whole lot to spend those pyreals on, so maybe it IS all about the Asherons (or whoever appears on the 10000 Pyreal trade note).  I do think that just offering a character a strongbox in an inn as opposed to a little cottage in the country is a bit more consistent with the world. I mean, come on. In UO everyone aspires to be a homeowner. A little two story brick number, with a picket fence and a tamed dog happily barking outside. It's not Sosaria, it's Suburbia! Maybe it's just me, but for me, the words "adventurer" and "homeowner" do not converge in that great Venn Diagram of Gaming Gestalt. "Sorry, I can't go with you to smash the enemy, I've got to work on the yard."<br><br>Being able to place a home (and thus a mark on the world itself) is an important ability of the game -- but not one everyone should feel <b>required</b> to do by the game mechanics. ("If I don't have a house with a trapped rodent, I can't be a 7X GM Warrior King!") Turbine gets a kudo for recognizing that options in this area are good.<br><br>Of course, they then turn around and lose this kudo for totally forgetting why people need secure trading. Here's what Stormwaltz has to say about that...<br><br><font color="#77FF77">What we'll probably do for secure trade is code a "broker" NPC, who can function as a pseudo-container for both sides. To force all players to interact through a secure trade interface at all times would be cumbersome - just ask the monarch the distributes ph4t 13wt to his vassals every week.</font><br><br>Well gee, that works. Allow secure trading, but only if a Speshul NPC is nearby! (You could call it "<a href="http://www.tradespot.net/" target="_blank">Tradespot</a>".) Historically accurate? Possibly. "Allrighty, Hegor the Stupid, give me 9000 Pyreals and I'll give you a sandwich." "Uuuuuh, OK." "Hah hah! I lied! *runs away*" "Duuuuh, that always happens. If dis were Darktide, I could do somethin about dat." <br><br>The question is, though, is trading something you want to encourage in an ORPG, and if so, is fraud something you want to encourage as well? Maybe reducing the frustration level of your players is worth a little inaccuracy.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem945238136,94884,"></a>

Users can vote on how apt/insightful/enlightening a given message is, on a scale from 0 to 5. Other users can filter the system to, say, only display messages that rate above a 2. The system works pretty well, especially given that it's a completely uncensored medium used and viewed by millions.<br><br>Unfortunately there's a few exploits that have crept into the system. Users get points that they can spend to moderate up posts, based on some criteria, such as being the first to post in a thread, that have been abused (some race to be the first to post on every topic, with a "FIRST POST!" message.) Some trolls have made it past the filtering system, and some rather useful messages have been moderated down because others saw them as flamebait.<br><br>Of course, this has nothing to do with ORPGs, until you realize that UO's Reputation system was modeled in large part on what Slashdot is trying to do.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem945104244,75650,"></a>

Some post-TwisTerTour 2000 analysis for you.<br><br>It's been fun <a href="http://www.thechosen.com/" target="new">hating Dr. Twister</a>. Many think that the current crop of rant sites basically started for no other reason than to say mean things about the poor Doctor. With a few <a href="http://aiwt.r33t.org" target="new">exceptions</a>, that's not quite true. <br><br>It's not TwisTer most of us despise -- but the community he represents. And that community is a large part of ORPGs, and one that cannot be ignored. It's the folks (not all kids, despite public opinion) that want to cut the corners, take the most direct route, and roll over whomever it takes to get to... well, to win.<br><br>Here's some quotes from that community, from the kTalk page on the last story:<br><br><font color="7777FF" size=2>Oh dear, you people are so silly...  Ive been exploiting bugs since beta, you guys think drtwister is the reason people exploit? You're kidding yourself...our clique knew about the bugs posted on his site months and months before he even posted them. You people have no fucking clue...he held SO MANY BUGS BACK so many bugs that could have really, really fucked up this game beyond repair. Bugs i still know that arent fixed ^^ You people are so retarded scapegoating him just because he ran a webpage.<br><br>---<br><br>i loved getting some great bugs from him and it highten my play 10 fold. Dr twister is a very important person in UO. He isn't the one you should be made at, it should be the people that allowed this to happen. The ones that don't act apon them like they should. I can only abuse teh bug, not correct it. Besides in a game that is more, who screwed whom more, harder and faster than the next guy, it adds another level of play that only UO can bring to the table.</font><br><br>This is the community from which Twister came -- he was an active poster on xsploitz.com's forums before opening his site, and his <a href="http://members.home.net/drtwister/dt-phil.html" target="new">UO manifesto</a> posted when he opened the site states, quite clearly, that his most fervent hope is that said community wins -- uses every bug and exploit at their disposal to screw their opposition over. Some pertinent quotes from that document: <br><br><font color="77FF77" size=2>When something happens to you, the typical response is, "sorry, it's part of the game." SO, the bugs were written in as part of the game, we can use them to our advantage. If they don't want them their anymore, they can fix them. They can't hold us responsible, "it's part of the game" after all.<br><br>So, will bugs, exploits, hacks and cheats ever stop in games? NO! Is this sad, does it ruin the game for everyone? I guess, but they will still always be there. <br><br>OSI encourages us to role play. The more we role play, the better the world will be for everyone. GREAT! From now on, I will be role playing a cheater and exploiter. After all, I don't cheat and exploit others in real life. <br><br>As long as people play games, the more popular a game becomes, the more likely someone will write a trainer, or cheat for it. My advice, you can't beat them, might as well join them. For all of you out there, debating on whether or not to use a 3rd party program or not, my advice is YES! Use them. Chose between UO Plugin, or UO Extreme. Don't use UO Assist, you have to pay for it. <br><br>Screw OSI, because they have screwed us. We are all in this together, and we are all looking for that next big bug. Simply, to make the game more enjoyable. If you have a bug, keep it to yourself. Exploit it, have fun with it, use it as a party trick. Next, share it with a friend, someone who can help you define it and perfect it. Share it with me. <br><br>Share your bugs, so we can all enjoy them, that's what we are all here for.</font><br><br>That was posted in December of 1998. It's a long road from there to here...<br><br><font color="77FF77" size=2>The Dr.TwisTer Network is not going anywhere and I will continue to bring the truth about games to those who play them. <br><br>My commentary and philosophies have been criticized and praised. Everything that happened was indeed an experience. I'm glad I was able to be here for those who needed it, and help out whenever I could. It's your decision if I helped make this game better, and it's your thoughts how you would like to remember me in UO.</font><br><br>What a long, strange road it's been, indeed. It's been very interesting indeed, watching Dr. Twister grow up. His two currently active sites, for Asheron's Call and Shadowbane, are actually positive influences for the community that they serve. And so far we haven't seen any AC exploits. A few items that tiptoe right up to the line (such as line of sight exploits vs. monsters) but no outright lusty screwing of thy neighbor as we've seen so often on his UO site.<br><br>Why is that? Well, two reasons, really. One, as I mentioned before, I think the good Doctor has actually matured somewhat in his outlook -- he isn't openly out to destroy the games he covers now. And second is the nature of UO itself. <br><br>Ultima Online is unique among current ORPGs in that you <b>can</b> screw thy neighbor, in a multitude of quite irritating ways. And there are many, many people who are looking for every possible edge in order to do exactly that. To kill you, to take everything you own, to suck every last possession out of your house, and to stand over your dead corpse while your ghost watches him type : OWNS you, motherfucker!. <br><br>In that kind of hostile environment, where the game is literally a free-fire zone, it is a very small step to use a bug in the game to gain an advantage, especially over that punk who just OWNED you. And it's oh, so easy to blame Origin for introducing that bug into the game in the first place. It's all their fault, you think, because after all, since it's in the game, everyone but me is already doing it. I'm just catching up.<br><br>The question you <b>really</b> should be asking yourself, is how do you win in such an environment? What does it mean to win? At what point does it leave "the game" and become the player itself? And this question remains, whether or not TwisTer is updating his web site. <br><br>*steadfastly refuses to comment on OSI/EA's incredibly braindead, community chilling and morally void legal blackmailing of the UO2 affair*<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem945094329,94749,"></a>

Another interview with Richard "If we keep him doing interviews he'll stay out of the office and leave us alone!" Garriott, this time on <a href="http://www.gamepen.com/preview/PC/12_10_1999_1177_1.asp" target="other">Gamepen</a>. This one goes into great detail on his thoughts on the state of ORPGs in general and UO in particular. Interesting read. Here's quite a few excerpts.<br><br><font color="#77FF77" size=2>[Although there will be no more single-player Ultimas,] we&#8217;re still going to be doing Ultima Online, which is set in Britannia, so I&#8217;m predicting we&#8217;ll have another cycle of ten Ultima Onlines. And we actually are now looking into other opportunities. For example, for Ultima Online 2, we have a joint venture going with Todd MacFarlane, who is not only helping design some monsters for inside the game, but also they&#8217;re going to be building models and action figures for all the creatures and characters from the game as well...<br><br>...In my mind, one of the really big lessons for Ultima Online had to do with the following little story. Imagine you built a city and the city could hold a couple hundred thousand people. And so one day you opened up the highways and said, &#8220;Hey, everybody come over and live." And couple hundred thousand people show up on your doorstep to come live there. And let&#8217;s suppose that when people move in, there are a variety of kinds of things that happen. First of all, there are potholes in the streets, so there are some actual physical issues and problems in the infrastructure of the city. But let&#8217;s also suppose that there are some laws that people don&#8217;t like. Let&#8217;s say the law for murder is too lenient. So what&#8217;s going to happen once these hundreds of thousands of people show up on your doorstep? They&#8217;re, of course, going to want to voice an opinion and have that changed.<br><br>Well, in the real world, in a city, most neighborhoods have a little neighborhood association that gets together and talks about neighborhood watch or school bus issues, and things that they think are important. That little group will lobby the school board or whoever might be appropriate, or they might lobby city council members. And city council members might meet with the mayor of the city, and there&#8217;s a bureaucracy of infrastructure through which government and citizens communicate with each other. Well, in the case of Ultima Online, we built a city, we invited hundreds of thousands of people to come, they did come, there were potholes in the street, and there were laws that some people disagreed with. However, there were no neighborhood associations, there were no mechanisms&#8230;there was no bureaucracy through which to communicate up and down. So what happened is, hundreds of thousands of people with an opinion about the murder law decided they want to e-mail somebody. Who do they mail? At the very least, they mail Origin, and often they mailed me. And so suddenly hundreds of thousands of people are e-mailing Origin and/or myself with very legitimate concerns or issues from major to minor. But of course, there&#8217;s no way one person can respond or even a hundred people can even respond to anything like that traffic flow. And so what immediately people think then is that nobody&#8217;s listening, that nobody cares, and that the company has moved on to other issues, oblivious to the fact that we still have the entire company devoted for at least a year and a half to just this one problem. It was a very important and interesting learning process, to where now at Origin, Ultima Online Live is probably a third of the entire company if you look at the total personnel devoted to it, from game masters and ministers of information, web folks and game developers, and marketing and the whole bit...<br><br>...There&#8217;s an analyst out in California named Amy Jo Kim who&#8217;s been studying Ultima Online. And she has been very insightful in a lot of her thinking about online communities. One of the major tenets that she puts forth that I agree with is that when you create an online game, the creators have an idea of what it should be or what they want it to be, and that&#8217;s what people see as the invitation to come. And people who decide they like that invitation come to be part of that. But once they&#8217;re all there, they&#8217;re in control, in the sense of if they decide that they no longer like the vision of the creators, and that they want to move it in some other direction, it&#8217;s futile to try to continue to herd them back. It&#8217;s kind of like if there was an old ladies&#8217; knitting club, and the original founder moves off, or if she&#8217;s just outnumbered. Maybe they decide to turn it into a car club if they want&#8230;that&#8217;s just the prevalent opinion of the masses. That was an interesting lesson for us, too: how to understand what the people are really interested in. How to see the important data through the chaff, because on any issue, there are lots of opponents and supporters, and its hard to know what the true general opinion  is, and then deciding how to respond to that&#8230;it&#8217;s really interesting. We are now in a service business more than we are in a creator/content business...<br><br>...[The Ultima Online] code-base... what&#8217;s interesting&#8230;it&#8217;s only been really over the last six months&#8230;we went through a very concerted effort to basically re-write the entire game. Not to change the functionality, as much as make the game code much more stable and robust so that we could continue to modify it and add to it more successfully. A year ago, one of the reasons why changes were so slow and difficult and buggy was because the code was not prepared for this level of modification and addition and continuity. But now it is...<br><br>...We&#8217;re not planning on shutting down Ultima Online 1. We&#8217;re planning on Ultima Online 2 being a new, hopefully better in many ways experience. But by no means is it a literal replacement for Ultima Online 1. Nor do we currently have plans for people to be able to sell off all their real estate and migrate all their characters across. We might do something like that, but it&#8217;s still too early to tell exactly how these two things are going to work together...</font><br><br>Note that in this interview, as in all the others, very little is actually said about Ultima 9. Go figger.<br><br>Well, as if anyone cared, I tried Ultima 9 again, but am stuck outside of Trinsic now. Apparently you are supposed to talk to the spirit of Dupre by putting his ashes on the shrine (a method <b>I've</b> always used when talking to dead people) but it isn't working. I then went through all of Shame to the very end, only to be turned around because I haven't talked to the dead guy. So if anyone could clue me in on what I missed when talking to this dead guy, I can finish the game and clear up more room for Unreal Tournament mods.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944937438,62683,"></a>

Tomer responds to the stories below. We're getting into he said/she said territory here, and as I know little of the circumstances surrounding this story this will be the last posting regarding it.

I personally did not think I owed her anything since she only ever found me one mare, and I paid her for that scouting service at the time.&nbsp; While trying to give away pets, both Pax and non-Pax npks kept attacking me and I did eventually get overwhelmed.&nbsp; They kept attacking me from the porch of Cyndra's patio house (Ladies of the Lair tavern) and eventually I died.&nbsp; I was in stat loss, and too depressed from being hacked and perma red to bother macroing off the 40 hours.&nbsp; And if I were not to macro in case I did not want to risk getting caught (though back them I would not have, only now am I on this stupid "watch" list of the GMs), I just did not 40 hours in 7 days to play as a GHOST!&nbsp; So all my pets in the stables degraded and including the mare.&nbsp; Anyway Cyndra in her warped mind felt she was wronged by not getting a mare (I do not think she was aware they decayed in stables, but I would not have given her one even if they didn't) and would attack me with her other char Nightstorm all the time.&nbsp; WHich was not really a problem since he is a weak fighter.&nbsp; Problem was now the only stable I could use (other than Duir which I not learn about for a while) was within firing range of the patio of his house (from which I am banned).&nbsp; For months npks would attack me, run in the tavern, and then attack me more from the patio.&nbsp; Cyndra continued to use my wyrms to attack not just my guildmates but me as well.&nbsp; And during these attacks every pax citizen would gang uop to killme or loot me.&nbsp; None deserved any mercy in my eyes, and I showed none.&nbsp; I went ahead and killed dozens a people a day there.&nbsp; And it was easy to avoid counts, as they frequently attacked first.&nbsp; After a while they stopped that and I started using other strategies to get them to attack me, like cast invis on the wyrm so they will jump me, etc.&nbsp; Also 8 hour counts are not that hard to deal with.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Anyway, it is BS like this that make me hate them so much and which is why I setup that bounty system.&nbsp; I made most of my gold not from just selling pets, but real estate selling and some cross shard trading.&nbsp; Also killing dozens of people a day not exactly unprofitable.</FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Princess Faith (another old GM Tamer on chessie) and Chrismar Rye can vouch I am the same person.&nbsp; But this is only an attempt to deflect from the true issue.&nbsp; These whiners and liars complained and complained and complained about me killing them until they got the GMs attention.&nbsp; And now they have me under a microscope and will ban me at the least opportunity.&nbsp; Maybe I will accidently curse, take a leak and be non-responsive, or someone will report me for some BS that I am cheat and *poof* they will perma ban me.&nbsp; So I rather not lose all I have on the account, give it to my friends, get my affais in order and quit without giving them the satisfaction of making all my stuff degrade when they ban me.&nbsp; Personally, I will never play another OSI game again.&nbsp; The games are great, but the management is terrible.</FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>-The Murderer Tomer, Grandmaster Tamer</FONT></DIV></font><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944926328,2620,"></a>

Many of you have noticed a new shard up, "Cool Test Center". Here's the word from Runesabre.<br><br><font color="#77FF77"I know many of you enjoyed the old Abyss Test shard we had running months ago. Namely, many players missed being able to "blow off steam" by jumping onto the old Abyss Test shard, configuring their character to whatever they wanted then playing without worrying about character building and making gold. <br><br>Well, I have some pretty good news. When Test Center comes back up, it will have a new feature that will do the following: <br><br>1) When you login in with a character for the first time, you get 10,000 gold pieces! <br><br>2) You can configure your character's stats and skills to anything you wish at anytime you wish as long as your character remains legal with skill and stat caps. To find out how to do this simply login with your character and say "help" and a simple built-in help dialogs will appear to instruct you how to configure your character. <br><br>Some examples to configure your character are as follows: <br><br>say "set str 80" and your strength stat will be set to 80. <br><br>say "set swords 554" and your swords will be set to 55.4 swordmanship. <br><br>All the skill keywords you need to use are available by simply saying "help".<br><br>Hope you enjoy the new feature and will aid you both in testing new features on our Test Center as well as create a new place for you to simply play as you wish.</font><br><br>So QUIT YER DAMN WHINING ABOUT ABYSS.

A correspondent who wishes to remain anonymous responds:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">First, the person currently playing Tomer is not the original account owner. The original player quit UO and sold his account about 6 months ago. The character was originally blue, and it was during this time that GM Tamer status was achieved. The original Tomer was not a problem at Pax and even occasionally sold tamed dragons to Pax citizens.<br><br>Which brings up the question of: Who owns the account now? Well, I'm told it is the player behind the well-know Chessie PK (and prick) Greystoke. It is he who made the character red. So, there is no need to feel any sympathy for how hard it is for a murderer to train up to GM Tamer status. Furthermore, I'm told he does things like take tamed dragons into dungeons, and use them to block off spawn and basically take over the place. No, it's not illegal, I suppose.... but it's one reason why people have complained so much about him.</font><br><br>I thought a PK Tamer was a bit hard to pull off...

Big news on the Shadowbane front today. Wolfpack went public with a large part of what they plan to do with Shadowbane - and it looks sweet.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">In a market populated by less than a handful of titles, Wolfpack Studios, Inc. is touting a new style of game play, created through the coupling of two distinct game concepts -  Roleplaying and Large-Scale Strategy games - into one cohesive whole. <br><br>Roleplaying games, a staple of the gaming industry for years, typically focus around a single character or small group of characters exploring the world in search of treasure and adventure. Strategy games, on the other hand, center on commanding troops and acquiring territories, and players take on the roles of generals and nobles to make decisions that impact the entire world. <br><br>This design adds a large-scale warfare system on top of the fully functional Roleplaying game - allowing the more strategic-minded players to bind together and vie for control of territories within the online world. In a massively multi-user setting, this twist gives rise to a whole new realm of game play - guild politics and siege warfare.</font><br><br>Go <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/pressrelease12-09-99a.html">here</a> for the full article. <br><br>I like this. I like this a LOT. This has the potential of a whole new gaming experience; the primary problem with ORPG PvP up to this point is that it is, on the whole, nothing more than pointless gang warfare. The strategy layer tries to break this paradigm - finally, something to fight over besides "we r0x j00". <br><br>For more information, check <a href="http://sb.drtwister.com/">a very special episode of Diff'rent Strokes</a>, where Kimberly explains to a hurting Willis that sometimes, no really does mean no.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944768171,88512,"></a>

Ronald McDonald is having an <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/">existential crisis</a>. Not normally the sort of thing you expect from someone whose writing repertoire mainly consists of discussing which hand he uses when masturbating, but the man sat, and thought, and sat some more, and thought some more, and decided that games and the web and all that just kind of bit.<br><br>He's right in that we've reached a breakthrough point in our ability to coalesce as a community and discuss down to minutae what is important to us. Take this site for example. It gets about 5 to 7 thousand visitors a day. More when I mention sex and/or counselors, less when I get all wordy and shit and decide to tell people how to design their games. <br><br>I do think there's enough interesting things going on to justify a daily updated web site of news and commentary on the online roleplaying game scene (hey, you're soaking in it!); but there are slow days and fast days, like anywhere else. We've hit a slow time, I think. <br><br>Asheron's Call hit, and it wasn't much different from Everquest and UO when they launched (with the possible exception that, unlike both EQ and UO, it actually ran somewhat correctly the first day). The UO dev team is soliciting information on how to fix the game. The EQ dev team is finally starting to figure out their game may be broken. The UO2 dev team is cowering in a corner and praying people forget all that crap TwisTer posted about Meerlings and Jukas. Stuff like that.<br><br>If this site has any guiding philosophy, it's pretty much borrowed from <a href="http://www.seanbaby.com/">Seanbaby</a> - let's all get together and laugh at the stupid people. I mean, we're talking about grown men and women obsessing over what level their Shadowknight Troll is. The only logical response <i>is</i> laughter.  It's pretty funky that a community has grown up around all this, and you're a part of it, by virtue of reading these words. Doesn't matter how many times you wash your hands afterwards, either.<br><br>So are our mutual obsessions, you the reader and I the writer, are they born of futility or of longing? I would like to think the latter; that in the disconnected society at large in which we reside, where I just spent FOUR FUCKING HOURS in a meeting room with people I don't happen to like very much discussing the results of our Birkman Personality Profiles (I know this will probably be a shock to all of you, but I pegged pretty low in Empathy), that the mere act of belonging to a community is in itself an enriching achievement, no matter how whacked it is.<br><br>I think the Net is a preview of how we will deal with our environment globally in the years to come -- too much information rushing past us, and we sort of grab randomly, childishly, at the odd bits and pieces of stuff that zoom by, and if we ever happen to actually see anyone else in that massive stream of stuff, it means more than you'd ordinarily think.<br><br>So, hi.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944682760,636,"></a>

All the action lately is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/009312.html/">here</a>. Brad "Aradune" McQuaid, with an assist from Gordon "Calandr...Abashi" Wrinn, started with a detailed list of what he thought the EQ team had done to every class. (It's right at the top of the thread.) Most pointed out that it was a little odd that bug fixes such as pets being attacked from across the zone and cosmetic changes such as necro pets being a different color were somehow making up for kiting and feign death nerfs. <br><br>McQuaid hung in there, and made an impassioned plea for the future of his game. Here's some excerpts.<br><br><font color="77FF77">I'd like to address what I perceive to be a common theme throughout this thread, and that's a resistance to change. I think some players, while they want the game to change in general, and for new and exciting things to be added, don't want change that affects their character, especially if they perceive that change to be negative. I understand this and have been victim to 'nerf's playing MUDs and other similar games. Some players also don't like the fact that earlier players were able to use tactics, exploits, etc. to progress in the game, but by the time they would have had the opportunity to use similar means, we'd changed the game.<br><br>I understand this, and this is why this thread has grown with many long and passionate posts. <br><br>I must submit to you, however, that the administrators and keepers of an online, persistent game MUST continue to make changes to the game in order to preserve balance and to address areas of the game that become contrary to design, balance or intent. There is no way one can launch a game like EverQuest and then simply sit back and let it go. The game changes on its own, the knowledge base increases, the average player advances from low level areas, to mid, and then to high -- the entire game dynamic is altered through natural evolution. And it is our responsibility to protect the long-term health of the game and unfortunately this is at times at the perceived expense of a group of players. Unfortunately, sometimes the good of the many must outweigh the good of the few...<br><br>...the EverQuest team here at Verant has quite simply created and designed the most popular, successful (and in my not so humble opinion the BEST) MMORPG to date. It continues to grow (yes, we'll be launching another server soon), and it continues to sell like crazy over 9 months after its release (mostly by word of mouth, by the way), and honestly if all of you were not so addicted to this game and overall having a blast, you'd not be so passionate, playing hours and hours a day, and responding to this thread's original post with over 200 detailed responses in 24 hours. You have my pledge that the game will continue to overall get better, and I really believe that as the game matures we will need to do fewer and fewer 'nerfs'. And you also have my pledge that our communication to our players will improve radically. We are very guilty of not explaining adequately why we do things, or what we've changed, and I apologize for this. We WILL do better (go Abashi, go!). If we have to make a hard decision and make a change that negatively impacts a class or some such, the very least we can do is let you all know the details and the how and the why.</font><br><br>Again, the entire thread is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/009312.html">here</a>. If there was something about your class you think is being ignored (like, say, rogue pickpocketing nerfs destroying their chance of ever being accepted in a group, for example) <b>now</b> is your chance to be heard. Unlike most Internet forums, it seems Verant is actually paying attention to this one.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944602702,98865,"></a>

Here's my answer to Sunsword:<br><br>PvP is based on the guild system. If PvP is to be revamped, the guild system needs to be revised as well.<br><br>What do people fight for in real life? Geography and ideology. Let's establish a base for both of those.<br><br>Establish factions - basically, types of guilds. Here's my suggested guild types:<br><br>FELLOWSHIP<br>What all guilds currently are. A group of players, without political affiliation. Not inherently attackable without penalty by anyone save specifically declared enemies. No special benefits or penalties. May loot anyone. Subject to stat loss.<br><br>ORDER OF THE SILVER SERPENT<br>Pledged to defend Britannia and the virtues, and to save Britannia from its current chaos. May only attack REDS (no grays) or hostile factions. May only loot members of hostile factions. All members of the Royal Militia recieve 10% discount from all merchants in Britain, Trinsic, Minoc, Jhelom and Serpent's Hold. If a member of the Royal Militia goes RED they are removed from their guild (which is theoretically impossible). <br><br>FREE PEOPLE'S ARMY<br>Pledged to overthrow the tyrannical rule of Lord British. May only attack hostile factions. May only loot members of hostile factions. All members of the Free People's Army recieve a 10% discount from all merchants in Occlo, Nu'Jhelom and Buccaneer's Hold. Members of the FPA are KOS by guards in other cities. Members of the FPA automatically have 5 murder counts added when joining (in other words, they are all red). Does not suffer stat loss.<br><br>SAGES<br>Neutral guild that seeks knowledge and wisdom (and some rumor, power over the world). A guild may only join the Sages if ALL members have a Magery skill over 70. If a member of the Sages drops below 70 Magery due to skill loss, they are removed from their guild. May only attack hostile factions. May only loot members of hostile factions. All members of the Sages recieve a 10% discount from all merchants in Moonglow, Cove, and Wind. Does not suffer stat loss.<br><br>MERCANTILE CONSORTIUM OF BRITANNIA<br>Neutral guild that seeks only to make a profit. A guild may only join the MCB if ALL members have one or more of the following skills above 70: Blacksmithing, Carpentry, Bowcrafting, Tailoring, Fishing, Alchemy. If a member of the MCB at any time does not have greater than 70 skill in any of these, they are booted from the guild. Members of the MCB may not attack or loot any BLUE player. All members of the MCB recieve a 10% BONUS when selling items to any merchant. Does not suffer stat loss.<br><br>BARDIC COLLEGIUM<br>Neutral fellowship of bards. A guild may only join the Collegium if ALL members have over 70 in Musicianship. If a member of the Collegium drops below 70 Musicianship due to skill loss, they are booted from their guild. Members of the Collegium may not attack or loot anyone save members of hostile factions. All members of the Collegium recieve a 10% discount from all merchants in Yew, Skara Brae, and Vesper.<br><br>Now, we have four different factions (five, if merchants are counted) and a presumed geographical base for each of these. What are we to do with this?<br><br>Vendor control/discounts. How many times have you said, "I wish my vendor wouldn't sell to X guild". Well, set that up. Each public house can declare itself allied to a faction. (Its sign would change to the faction's flag). Hostile factions would be automatically banned from that house and from transacting with its merchants. Members of that faction would get a 20% discount from those vendors. (Another reason to join the faction system).<br><br>Integration into ingame events. People would be quite a bit more interested in the ingame fiction if it directly affected their character/guild. Say, an invasion by the OSS of Occlo. If it succeeded, the FPA would no longer have Occlo as a safe haven. I think that would attract some attention among the players.<br><br>Ranking of guilds within each faction. The most successful ones would have a say in how the faction was run. A ruling council for each faction. The nicer ones would be democratic, with elected officers. The not as nice ones would be dictatorships, ruled by the most powerful guilds.<br><br>How would this affect the non-faction player? Only that they are excluded from this part of the game; a guild could continue on as before, PKing freely if they so choose. They still get stat loss of course, and factions could possibly declare their vendors open only to members and allied factions, which would lock them out of concievable resupply.<br><br>Thoughts?<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944599806,5491,"></a>

In the "We're Not Saying A Damn Thing About Ultima 9" publicity tour, Richard Garriott is hitting all the usual suspects giving interviews on his Next Big Things, the still deep in production X and the somewhat closer to release UO2. Here's comments from his <a href="http://www.well-rounded.com/games/reviews/garriott_intv_1.html">Well Rounded Network</a> interview:<br><br><font color="77FF77">While he's not directly involved with Ultima Online 2, Garriott says he's keeping an eye on things and is thrilled with what he's seen so far. Todd McFarlane (Spawn) is designing all the creatures for the game, which Garriott describes as simply amazing. To accommodate McFarlane's detailed drawing style, the graphics engine on UO2 has been given a hearty dose of steroids. Ultima Ascension offers breathtaking visuals. Garriott says UO2 will blow the current game away, utilizing T&L lighting, and deforming meshes.</font><br><br>So, instead of getting 5 FPS, we may get 2 FPS. But only with a Voodoo 4.<br><br>But what's REALLY scary is THIS quote:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">And, for the first time, you'll be able to earn a real-world living in an online world. UO2 will allow players to run virtual shops, selling products that can be used in the game to other players for actual greenbacks. "I want to put the ability to put real money in a virtual world," he says, with a proud smile on his face.</font><br><br>You know, this is quite possibly the most clueless statement ever made by any gaming industry figure.  I mean, did he just buy ten pounds of crack while he was in Times Square? Because that's about the only way I can explain someone actually advocating making a RL living off of UO2. You think we're seeing duping scandals NOW. Wait until a PK keeps someone from making a weekly paycheck. No, better yet, wait until someone figures out that the GMs make $10 an hour.<br><br>For an example of how screwed up money can make an online game, look at Simutronics' Gemstone III. There a brain trust figured out that instead of having players sell things on eBay, they could make more money by cutting out the middle man. <b>Everything</b> is for sale on Gemstone III. Just have your Visa or Mastercard handy.<br><br>You know, somehow I suspect I'm not going to be a stop on the Lord British Magical Mystery Tour.

Anyone else wondering how this punchlist that Origin posted on 9/22 is going?<br><br><font color="7777FF">Coming Soon for Ultima Online: The Next 6 Months<br>Origin is incredibly excited to be able to announce to you the latest plans for Ultima Online. Over the next 6 months, we will be expanding and improving UO. As features become ready, they will be rolled out to the existing playerbase in regularly scheduled updates.<br><br>We&#8217;ve detailed an assortment of our plans below, and will be providing extensive information on each as they are implemented over the next six months.<br><br><b>Land Expansion</b><br>While the specific details of these lands are still being formalized, they will undoubtedly bring new opportunities for housing and adventuring.<br><br><b>Options for PvP</b><br>The addition of this land will allow us to geographically separate play styles within UO, meaning we can create areas for engaging, adventuring experiences without the element of player versus player combat. There will, of course, still be plenty of room for player versus player combat. In fact, PvP will be expanded and improved in the future.<br><br><b>Party System</b><br>A party system is being designed to allow group adventuring. We plan to allow you to easily share profits and resources with your party while hunting.<br><br><b>Improved Monster AI</b><br>We will be upgrading monsters with an improved AI to enable them to react to players in new ways, in addition to making them more challenging to defeat overall.<br><br><b>Increased Veteran Player Volunteer Programs</b><br>We expect to have over 3,000 trained Counselors, Companions and Seers in place by February 2000 to support and enhance the world of UO. Interesting in joining us? Visit our Counselor Application area for details.</font><br><br>Almost three months into this self-imposed six month deadline, and we still haven't progressed beyond the You've Got Too Goddam Many ITems stage. <br><br>And, of course, it's also interesting that this punchlist isn't on uo.com any more.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944410381,42379,"></a>

  <p><i>And maybe, just maybe, if someone at a first-rate company with a first-rate budget could create a RPG that gave you rewards for doing something other than killing and stealing, we'd see the birth of a whole new type of online game. Nah, never happen.</i></p> <p><a href="http://www.cdmag.com/editorial/editorial_dec_1_99.html">This article</a> set me to thinking (always a dangerous process, even in the best of times).</p> <p>We've seen now the first generation of ORPGs. (Well, really, the 3rd or 4th if you count MUDs, which most developers do.) It's time to start thinking about what will go into the next generation.</p> <p>I think we'll start seeing some serious balkanization, as ORPGs quit trying to be everything to everyone and concentrate on what they do best. For example, there's really no reason for Everquest to have a PvP system, since everyone, even the designers, admit that the PvP system in EQ is broken. What EQ does well is level-based monster bashing and linear character development. UO's strengths lie in its persistent world simulation and its ability to handle large-scale PvP. UO does not do monster bashing well at all; its monsters are few, stupid, and easily defeated by AI exploitation. Yet UO continues to offer monster bashing, and EQ continues to offer PvP. Go figure.&nbsp;</p> <p>The next generation, which we're beginning to see glimpses of in products like Shadowbane and UO2, seem somewhat more focused, at least in the case of Shadowbane. (Not much is known of UO2 save that it will probably offer AI-dead monsters and rampaging PKs in a shiny new 3D engine. Everything else is just scurrilous unproven rumor and EA has the <a href="http://uo2.drtwister.com/">lawyers to prove it</a>.) Shadowbane's developers know that their game will offer PvP, and they plan to concentrate on that - no persistent world, no flashy monsters, just &quot;I want to Crush&quot;. It's not a bad concept, and for a game that has only a few screenshots to show for it, it's already attracted a loyal fan base. Lots of folks just want to Crush.</p> <p>Let's examine the other side of that coin for a second - the people who would be turned off by Shadowbane's concept. What sort of game would you design for them?</p> <p>Richard Garriott's been thinking about it. There's been more than <a href="http://www.gamedaily.com/features/LordBritish/index.shtml"> one</a> <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/022/193/garriott_interview3.html"> interview</a> lately about X, his newest project. From what he describes, X will be a multiplayer game shell wrapped around smaller, micro-adventures. Sort of like the <a href="http://www.neverwinternights.com/"> Neverwinter Nights</a> concept, actually, although I assume Origin won't force people to write their own. He's also been asking around, in more than one venue, how to design a game to attract two previously somewhat untapped markets, women and adults. (The two are not <b>always</b> one and the same, despite what my wife may tell you.) </p>  <p>Refer back to the quote I posted to begin this article. One sure way to attract the people turned off by previous attempts at an online world would be, oh, I don't know, a different sort of online world. One which wasn't Fragfest Online.</p> <p>Now for some specifics. I know this is probably heresy, but consider for a moment a virtuous Ultima - one that actually rewards moral behavior. (I know, paradigm shattering. Work with me here.) We'll use a theoretical reworking of UO as our model. Call it UO 1.5.</p> <p>Now, UO has tried to model measurements of moral behavior - fame, karma, reputation, et cetera. They've all failed. They've all failed <b>badly</b>. One of my first glimpses of Ultima Online was watching a friend set up EZ-Macro to laboriously feed a beggar that he had trapped in his house one fish steak at a time, to goose his &quot;Karma&quot;. Frankly, keeping prisoners in your home and force feeding them fish is not my personal idea of something we want to encourage.</p> <p>The reason they've failed, of course, is that the game depended on easily manipulated program code to try to measure moral behavior. UO's server couldn't tell the difference between someone committing a random act of kindness to a beggar on Britain's docks, and some sadistic gimp who kept small children in his home, forcing fish steaks into them hour after hour. All it knew was NPCGivenSmallWorthlessItem ++.&nbsp;</p> <p>I don't think the answer here lies in better code - there will always be ways to exploit program code, and five minutes later they will be posted on the net. Call it TwisTer's Law.&nbsp;</p> <p>I believe the answer here lies in that often maligned (hell often maligned by <b>me</b>) Volunteer Program.</p> <p>Volunteers may be many things, but they are all human beings. By being human beings, even the most craven, idiotic wastes of otherwise perfectly good chemicals that can somehow feign the ability to turn on a PC unassisted are in simple cognitive ability worlds past any program code that can ever be written. This can be leveraged, if done wisely.</p> <p>Think of the &quot;I Honor Thee&quot; karma grant. It's a reasonably good idea, unless you're trying to make Dread Lord. Now, picture that concept reworked as a system of positive reinforcement.</p><p>Assume that we have a working political system in UO. (I know, another hysterical conjecture. Remember, this is UO 1.5.) The player's natural desire to progress in &quot;rank&quot; in his or her world would, ideally, be channeled to work within this structure. (Picture for example Joshua Rowan's <a href="http://uodr.stratics.com/ideas/messages/92603815327034.html">nobility proposal</a>, used not only as a money sink but as a measure of online achievement. Or some variant of Asheron's Call's excellent <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/library/allegiance.html">allegiance system</a>.) The point being, there is a structure behind the game, that players can both interact with, and, if they devote enough time and effort to, become a part of. Sort of like the Counselor program, but actually in game, and as part of the game's story. </p><p>Now, here's where it gets interesting. This is <i>Ultima</i> Online, right? Those of you struggling through Ultima 9 are going through a crash course in Garriott Codes The Virtues right now. While imperfect, the Virtue system is heads above any previous attempt to add a moral code to gaming. Hell, no one else <b>tries</b> to add morality to gaming; most game designers are young males, barely out of college/high school, and the last thing they want is for someone to lecture them on morality. But remember, they are not our target audience. We're looking for the adults here, those who aren't overdosed on testosterone and anxiety. So, while imperfect, the Virtue system is a good point at which to start.</p><p>But, as we've already seen, you can't code the Virtues. Even Ultima 4 was a joke in its supposed measurement of moral behavior (it was revolutionary not because it succeeded, but because it actually dared to try). However... we have human beings. The Volunteer program.</p><p>Picture Counselors and Seers, empowered not to punish macroers and rescue the clueless, but empowered to reward goodness. Tacky as that sounds. If, say, one witnessed an act of Sacrifice -- a healer that gave his or her life to keep the rest of the party alive, to take a rather mundane example -- that could be rewarded with a Sacrifice point. These points would be rare - there are only so many Volunteers, after all - but they would be in the system. And once in the system, they could be coded around. Picture quests available only to the honorable, or to the humble.</p><p>This could have repercussions beyond the original intent. Imagine someone trying to powergame this system. They would have to be virtuous. Um. This is what we want. The system worked.</p><p>Points could be lost, as well, possibly replacing the reputation system now in place. For example, looting someone else's corpse is a somewhat unvirtuous act. While not penalized in other game mechanics, that person would have less and less claim to being a virtuous person. And they wouldn't be eligible to be part of the unfolding political/quest system; further marginalized from where the actual game takes place.</p><p>Now, this system would be easily exploited -- as easy as one corrupt person with the power to grant points. Of course, every system has this weakness. Any GM could, right now, make you 7X GM should they so choose. Oversight prevents that. Some oversight would need to be in place here as well.</p><p>Or, you could crush. Choose your game... and choose your audience. </p><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944295507,18678,"></a>

There was a bit of <a href="http://www.gamersx.com/messages/view.asp?id=vbvei">dialogue</a> between Warden of <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/">Wolfpack Studios</a> and myself on the <a href="http://www.gamersx.com/messages/overview.asp?board_id=14014">Shadowbane Devboard</a> regarding the One, Holy and Apostolic ORPG, and specifically how it would deal with issues such as random grief PKing that have become "issues", as Calandryll would term them, in other games. (Don't worry, Cal, I found your <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/workit.mp3">theme song.</a>)<br><br><font color="#77FF77">..just out of random curiosity, why is your natural assumption that we *haven't* considered this? <br><br>I mean, we went to all the bother of quitting our jobs, raising the money, hiring a staff, starting a company -- and yet it never occurred to us, in all of our planning, to make sure that the game system we are designing actually matches our target market?</font><br><br><i>I think asking what you consider to be your target market is a valid question, and one you didn't answer.</i><br><br><font color="#77FF77">No one actually asked. I would define out target market as "Those who purchased Diablo and love it." Simple and straightforward, that's my kind of marketing.<br><br>(Okay, okay, a quick disclaimer. I know this statement won't stand up under scrunity. Diablo was never created as a massively multiplayer game. Questions like "what about battle.net?" and all the other multiplayer issues that the Diablo team didn't address make this point a lot less valid -- but if you take it as a goal at a *very* high level, i.e. "I want a massively multiplayer Diablo that *works*, you should get a feeling for what we're trying to build..)<br><br>Shadowbane is going to have an exceptionally deep social system -- much moreso than any other game that has been released (or, to our knowledge, conceived of) to date. This system should cater to all types of game players -- even those who don't necessarily want to engage in PvP. </font><br><br><i>...except merchants? "I don't play these games to bake bread, I play them to crush." How will you create a world in depth without an economy? Everquest is a good example of what happens when you just rely on in-game drops to drive item acquisition.</i><br><br><font color="#77FF77">Sure -- provided of course that you make the best items in the game clearly better than the next tier, load them in a predictable place and interval, and in very short supply.</font><br><br><i>Pretty soon everyone has everything and is handing it off to their newbies. UO, for all its faults, at least has merchant classes that work (smiths, alchemists, etc).</i><br><br><font color="#77FF77">You are correct -- we do scratch merchants off the list. Shadowbane is a game about warfare and political intrigue, not a bakery or a fishing simulation. Sorry, but we know our limitations -- we've got one game that we really, really want to build and a limited time to do it. This is one area we felt could be crossed off the list.<br><br>To argue your point, by the way (that merchant skills are necessary for a viable economy,) the example that you give, the game with "working" merchants, really only has one or two classes that are (over time) viable professions -- blacksmithing and alchemy. Fishing, Baking, Carpentry.. the overall effect these skills have on "the economy" is actually quite negligible. When was the last time a UO player 'fished' himself into a Castle? The economy of UO is *actually* fueled by playerkilling, not their craft skills. Player killing (and, until recent changes, player thieving) is the clear and undisputed easiest way to amass wealth in that game.<br><br>In Shadowbane, our economy will actually be fueled at two levels -- at the micro level, by adventuring (and yes, sometimes by PvP combat, though our item bonding rules should balance that out dramatically) and at the macro level by the Guilds (and sadly, I can't say much more about that at this point.)<br><br>At it's heart, Shadowbane is a game about interaction, being a part of a group, and dealing with other groups -- PvP combat is just one small piece of the equation (and one that can be avoided, if you choose to do so.)</font><br><br><i>...but one that's been highlighted, in your publicity and by your fans. What does Shadowbane offer to the PvP-? What protection does Shadowbane offer from random PKing? I'll assume for purposes of discussion that random PKing is even considered undesirable.</i><br><br><font color="#77FF77">I think (or at least, I hope) we've been very clear about the clear difference we see between 'random playerkilling' and 'PvP combat.' Shadowbane will offer an entire spectrum of great gameplay for those who don't want to engage in PvP combat -- in fact, we've designed a whole host of activities beyond the ones you've all grown to expect (roleplaying, character development, adventuring in parties) that should round out the game quite nicely -- things like our feature character system, our vivid background story, our roleplaying and acting system (we've got more socials than any other game to date.)<br><br>I think the reason that our PvP system has received so much attention to date is, in large part, due to two factors : first, that we've taken a stance against a +pvp flag, opting instead for allowing safety through guild territories and reducing the pain of death; second, that the other games have treated the PvP system as an afterthought, or as a necessary evil of their system.<br><br>[Regarding PvP play styles,] I think the key, for us, is to build a game that is well rounded in all areas, and has a system that is flexible enough to handle a large variety of playing styles. I'm not suprised that we've received so much attention in this particular area (since the other games have done such a poor job of implementation on this particular point) but I think you'll find, eventually, that we're a better game in a LOT of different areas -- roleplaying, character advancement, and political intrigue, you name it. Don't let one little fear dissuade you from what might otherwise be an incredible gaming experience.<br><br>I guess my whole point is, "Try it." Before you condemn any game as being "too dangerous" or "too deadly," why don't we see how beta goes? We've tried to do a good job of attracting some of the best roleplayers, and most rotten playerkillers, alike. Lets see how the game runs.<br><br>Warden<br>Wolfpack</font><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944229622,12096,"></a>

Normally, as part of the Kinder Gentler phase of Lum the Mad, Inc. (at least till we get to New Hampshire, then all gloves are OFF baybee!) I wouldn't be so promsicuosly posting email on this subject. However, I think both of these notes raise issues beyond the obvious. Read them and see what you think. The first is from another KoC member:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Hello. My name is Narf and I am *STILL* a member of the guild Keepers of Chaos.  I am also guilty by association.  I emailed OSI as to find out which of my accounts is going to be watched.  Is it the one that is 2 weeks old with 0 gm chars?  Or is it the one that has 1 char, 9 months old, and not stat/skill capped?  My response is, im not banned yet but i have to play the rest of my UO Life in fear of banishment.  Does this mean im going to be watched the rest of my UO life because i was a member of a "Large chesapeake guild" and if someone even accused me of calling them a name i will get banned?  I have no idea, there response to the entire situation is very vague and has many holes.  Noone YET has been told why they have been banned,  Nothing YET has been proven as to why they were banned, and no REASONS have been given.  All i is Ezekiel has been playing for 2 1/2 years.  Yes he is an asshole online, but so what he pays 9.95 also.  If he ever did anything that was so heinous as to cause banishment why wait 2 years to do it?  It makes no sense.  Uo isnt only an ONLINE game, its a RL investment.  Everyone pays the 10$ a month to play, and all these characters and items thanks to EBAY have a RL Value.  Zeke lost all he worked for, 2 large bricks, 1 large forge, 1 BLOCKED off tower, many many small houses, all his characters, all his items... EVERYTHING and those alone can net thousands of dollars on EBAY.  Is it right to just delete everything he earned?  He spent a year + as a counselor helping people, OSI admits to him helping them find and fix BUGS in there game.  This is his payment?  The same can be said about anyone who was banned.  We all spent as many or more hours playing this game. We spent the same hard earned money to keep this habit alive.  We all spent the same hours playing.  All you people do is flame away saying we cheated, that we are assholes, we deserve to get banned.  Your reasons being.. I dont like you?  does that justify such an action as to permanent banishment and the deletion of all that was worked for.  I lost a house or to to OSI's deleting, and i wasnt banned? How come im not allowed to ask for reimbursement, Im owed at least a placed house, or 140$ in real life(based on ebay values).. Will i ask for it, or get it? No.  You people and your snap judgements and closed minds are what make us who we are.  We have become the "scapegoat" the "plague" the "problem" with what is wrong with UO.  And you know what if 1 guild can make this much difference by playing a game the way we wanted to, WITHIN THE GAMES LIMITS, and touch all of you in such a way to get a response... is that a bad thing??? Everything dont in the game, was DONE IN THE GAME, not at fault of us.. At fault of some really crappy programming.  We are the people who changed the game to how it is today.  When we pk'd, out came statloss.  When we notor pk'd out came the notor patch.  When we Virtue PK'd out came the virtue patch.  When guild wars patch came out we evolved into the biggest and strongest guild on the shard.  <br>We have bene the EXACT same guild for the past 2 years, faces may change, but the CORE/PRIDE/MENTALITY remains.  We have openly said to anyone if they want to do something about us, to war us.  We have been chaos for the entire length of the virtue/guildwars patch.  We have risked statloss to continue to PK.  We own all the top bounties on the PK board.  We are what makes the game exciting.  Answer this.  When you walk into a dungeon, does the thought that "pks" might be around the corner come into your mind?  Does the the thought of running or fighting excite you?  When your fighting someone do you get pumped up and want to win?  We helped shape this game into what it is.  And this is the payment we get.  They attack the leaders of the guild without proof, delete thousands and thousands of hours of work.  Delete items that are worth RL cash.  Try and destroy our guild..  The many that remain arent going to change the way in which we think.  We are going to continue to play the way we have played...<br>And we will never conform to your standards, just to make your gaming experience happy.  We play the game to enjoy it also, and this is how we do it.  Everything we do is legal, and BY THE RULES.  We are still here, and will remain here until this game dies.  Expect to see us back in warring action soon, and dominating the shard with probably even more support from the community with such an outrageous injustice commited to us.  Live in fear, Be afraid to carry your house keys, and be worried that the next corner you turn KoC might be there.<br><br>Mr. Narf</font><br><br>The next email comes from Evilseed;<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I just read what happened to the guild KoC on Chesapeake.  I play on Chesapeake, I know of them.  They have been around for a long time.  I know because I was one of the first people in KoC when it started.  I also know Zeke of KoC well.  I just want to attest to a few things from my point of view.  I don't like KoC, I don't hate KoC.. I'm pretty neutral.<br><br>About 2 years ago, I remember hanging out with Zeke when GM WileE gave us some necromancy regs to try and dupe.. as well as some other things such as ingots.  We duped them, reported back to the GM.  We tested several things.  We found many bugs this way, under direction from "higher-ups" at Origin.  If there is accusation to Zeke of duping, I don't doubt it's true.  I don't because I was there, as were GMs as we were testing.   If I had time, I might even be able to pull out some screenshots via my CDROM UO screenshot archive (eek, 15 cds!).<br><br>I know KoC and what they stand for.  They kill.  Anything that moves, they kill.  I can understand how OSI can see this as detrimental to the community, and I can understand how KoC argues that they are playing within game guildlines.  So I remain neutral :)<br><br>Just some more light on the situation...<br><br>(goes back to roleplaying in Paxlair and designing UOGuilds)<br><br>-- Evilseed aka LSD </font><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944228899,19925,"></a>

Well, yesterday was patch day for Everquest. Those lovable schmoes in the Class Balancing department (their coat of arms has a nerf gun on it somewhere) decided to "enhance" the Levitate spell.<br><br>You see, you used to be able to maintain levitation by recasting the spell. Which would make sense, so you wouldn't fall into that ocean or pool of lava or whatever. Well, that was "enhanced". Now, if you try to re-cast the spell, you get the message "You are already floating". <br><br>Which means that if you need to do a corpse retrieval over lava, better hope you get there before the spell wears off... or you get to try again! Until you lose so many levels you can no longer cast levitate, anyway.<br><br>But it gets better. The bard Levitate song also works using the same principle. But since bard songs "pulse" on and off, you basically hop up and down. Song goes off, song pulses, you get the "You are already floating" message, you fall. Lather, rinse, repeat.<br><br>In Everquest, the true quest is to divine the motivation of the game designers, it seems...<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944167550,15215,"></a>

Well, earlier it was Yamato, this morning Pacific fell victim to the strange and cryptic house decay bug. Origin quickly reverted to an earlier backup.<br><br>There's been some speculation that this is a result of the DoS (Denial of Service, not Disk operating System) attacks Origin's been hit with.

And you can damn well bet Origin has those puppies locked up tight. I mean, if they go down, their business goes down.<br><br>And if someone's found a way to corrupt those databases --- well, that means everything is fair game.

Just got this in the mail:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Hello Lum,<br><br>I am making my only public statement here, to you...<br><br>First lets settle a few issues.. This was a planned attack by OSI for awhile now, be it as it may, for whatever reason. KoC is one of the, if not the most hated Guild in Ultima Online. The Guild that previously held this title (MDK) were all banned. <br><br>After reading your latest news I'd like to comment on Each Issue at hand:<br><br>First off all my account and all its previous flaggings.. I have been flagged for alot of Minor issues.. Macroing etc.. Also being flagged for Duping back in the day and being disrobed from my counselorship. What that doesn't tell you is the history behind that. Back in the EARLY EARLY Days when UO first began there was a Dupe bug, and I was one of the Original people who found it. When I learned of this, I promptly told OSI about it. This started a Long relationship between myself and GM Wile. OSI would freqeuntly call my house and we would test the dupe to see if it still worked. I worked closely with them on the dupe bug until it was fixed.<br><br>Later on, I worked on the Increased Tacts bug and Swords\Archery. My character WAS banned but the GM at the time had no idea I was actually Testing this bug with GM Wile.  <br><br>For all my help, OSI made me a counselor. I was a counselor for many months. (This was long before counselors had jack for power.) It got to be pretty boring. I was pretty much anti-social, I started gating monsters to seer events, killing people at will, PKing, the whole nine yards. Well it looked pretty bad when XXX Was killed by Ezekiel, then Counselor Ezekiel would show up when you tried to complain about it. So OSI Disrobed me. <br><br><Gm_Joe> you were a counselor?  i robed you...1-25-98...?<br><[Ezekiel]> I was robed yes<br><[Ezekiel]> Yes<br><[Ezekiel]> YOu did LOL<br><[Ezekiel]> in Minoc<br><[Ezekiel]> You were around back then.. remember GM Wile? None of the GM's remember him :(<br><Gm_Joe> yes, he trained me<br><[Ezekiel]> Thats How I became a counselor<br><br>I haven't had any Major Infractions until they investigated me for Duping because some of the SUN members were also in or friends of KoC. My Accounts came back clean. Then I got a warning letter stating I was getting A LOT of tickets points from the ticket system, I threw alot of stuff away and made out pretty good. But that's not the point, Im in KoC, otherwise no one would have cared.<br><br>Next Issue:<br><br>The Snooze account on Siege. I don't own it, I never owned it. I don't know how to be more Frank than that. <br><br>The Recent Denial of Service Attacks:<br><br>Last night they were pretty bad, and now everyone is quick to point the fingers at KoC. Do you think we're that stupid? Ban some of us, so we're going to ruin everyone else's fun. I can't speak for everyone, but I can speak for myself. It's JUST A GAME. I have a lot of friends that still play and I know how PISSED you can get when you lose hours of work. Point the fingers elsewhere, this has been happening long before KoC got banned. <br><br>Yes I am banned, Yes I'll get over it (And I'll probably get alot more sleep now). Don't get me wrong. Ultima Online has kept me playing for 2 1/2 years, no other game will probably ever match that. The only regrets I have is the people who got banned simply for being [KoC]. Anyone who was a guild master on any shard with [KoC] above thier head was banned.<br><br>I enjoy reading all the posts "Im glad zeke is gone"  "F*cking Cheater" "Always hated him".. I would have been right there with them. But the funny thing is, if they knew me, I woulda been the first person to help them in any matter they needed help with.. <br><br>-Zeke (Rides off in the Sunset)</font><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944148967,55921,"></a>

Here's what Tyrant posted to COB last night about the Chessy downings:<br><br><font color="#7777FF">The service outage we are now experiencing is the latest in a series of malicious attacks on the Ultima Online service. The result is that tens of thousands of UO subscribers were unable to enjoy UO this evening. The servers will return to service as soon as possible and we will maintain the service as best we can. We deeply regret these outages and are working as diligently as possible to find a remedy to this issue. <br><br>These attacks are denying service to all dedicated UO players and we are taking the entire situation with the utmost seriousness. We have independent security consultants on call to assist us, and we have already begun the process of acquiring more robust security hardware. Law enforcement is involved also. We can only ask for your patience and understanding at this time. We will keep you updated as to our progress in this matter.<br><br>Finally, we can only reiterate how powerful you could be in helping us identify the responsible parties.

<p><font face="Arial">The core group that makes up the leadership of KoC (4 members, according to the guild), a guild based on Chesapeake and establishing themselves on Siege Perilous, were banned last night.

We had a tower and a few of our guys had liek    90 somthing magery. Apprently this is Illegal on SP. The tower was bought    from a cross shard trade of ches/baja gold for SP gold.

People accuse us    of cheating duping etc simply because we kill them. Im not going to deny it,    KoC has an ego and if we kill you we may say somthing about it and it pisses    people off to no end. Basically UO has come down to &quot;You killed me    therefor you cheated&quot;.

I cannot get into it but OSI is getting upset with KoC. Actually they should have something in their email about it. I would just be safe.<br><br>So what do they do? They ban the leader and multiple house owner of this Vicious guild.. Being me, Im banned x2 Both my accounts gone.. Defiance is perma banned to.. Looks like EVERYONE that was on the KoC stone got E-mails warning them that they belong to a guild, basically which causes trouble (Ala MDK) and noone likes. Well.. I don't know what to say..<br><br>They deleted all my houses on Chessy and the KoC tower (Legacy) Will soon fall as well. Is this the end of KoC? It is as far as the abbreviation goes.. I hope everyone still tries to have fun..<br>I am certain I will never get my account back and I'll paste why in a minute..But dont give up on Siege.. Get a new Guild Abbreviation, and place a new houses in a good location. Dont give up there.<br><br>From what I heard, we had a shitload of complaints that we were ALL mages on Siege, and complaining that our Magery far exceeded what it should have been. And GMs were simply tired of taking our Shit on Chess. So they blanket banned.<p>Ok guys.. Been a good 2 1/2 year ride.. And remember.. KoC is just an Abbreviation..

Remember the suspicion of money laundering on Siege involving Tradespot? Here's a tip someone sent me that may help you connect the dots:</font></p><blockquote>  <p><font face="Arial">Guildmaster of KoC Ezekiel is also known as Snooze on SP  &quot;Second account&quot;. remember your rares items for sale? Who bought em?  Also the GM of KoC sold SUN duped items for his friend on e-bay.</font></p></blockquote><p><font face="Arial">Those are the facts as we stand. Now for supposition, rumor and innuendo. You know, what we here at LumCo do best.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Chesapeake went down several times last night, while all this was going on.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Origin has said that the shards have been, and continue to be, under Denial of Service attack. (&quot;nuking&quot;).</font></p><p><font face="Arial">And I got this email. </font></p><blockquote>  <p><font color="#FFFF00"><font face="Arial">i was at around at koc tower when  this happened, gm lint was stripping down</font> <font face="Arial">the koc  tower items inside while we were locked outside. around this time</font> <font face="Arial">chesa  server dropped 2 times and on cob it says it was due to dos attack.</font> <font face="Arial">then  i mentioned to my friends around. &quot;they did some more nuking&quot; gm  lint</font> <font face="Arial">that was just at tower working on the tower  says says &quot;i got you ip&quot; For me</font> <font face="Arial">that is no  way to treat a customer. its more like a threat. she assumed from</font> <font face="Arial">the  words i said that I nuked chesapeake. </font></font></p>  <p><font color="#FFFF00"><font face="Arial">instead of readily presenting</font>  <font face="Arial">herself and inquiring, she never identified at first OSI  employee and her</font> <font face="Arial">first words were &quot;i have your  ip&quot;.

I got a clean log, maybe i  have 1 macro</font> <font face="Arial">warning but that is about it for all my  uo life since the beggingin of uo.</font> <font face="Arial">maybe because i'm  friends with koc so they by default think that way by</font> a<font face="Arial">ssociation?</font></font></p></blockquote><p><font face="Arial">So obviously, Origin suspects KoC is involved in the attacks on the shards. Are they in fact responsible? I don't know. If OSI had proof I'm pretty sure we'd all hear about it by now. On the other hand, they may also be collecting information for prosecution; DoS attacks aren't something you get a slap on the wrist for. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">As always, more as it develops.</font><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944141465,59768,"></a>

Here's a followup to the story we posted earlier on the macroer/AFKer cast into the pits of Bucs Den:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Some time ago, I heard about a story of abuse on the part of GM Clyde. It seems a character named THC was spotted "macroing" and sent to the location commonly referred to as "macro jail" - a room full of gates to various locations. THC is a red murderer due to his creation of trapped chests. His efforts had earned him GM status in tinkering, as well as at least 2 other skills. He also liked to walk around in his tower wearing his full set of Ranger Armor, under the theory that wearing it made it much harder to be looted while he was offline.<br><br>Anyway, he returns to his PC to see GM Clyde say, "Hmm perma red, GM tinkerer, full ranger set. Let's see how well you do in Buc's Den". THC was then teleported into a fracas in Buc's den where he was a quick kill due to the armor he was wearing. He paged Clyde several times, and did eventually resort to inappropriate language to the GM (fueled by anger and frustration). GM Clyde never responded.<br><br>When I heard about this, I immediately emailed uoconcerns@uo.com and within 24 hours, I was contacted via email by William Leverett at Origin. He promised to pull the server logs and investigate this matter, but was reluctant to promise anything until a review could be performed. I continued to keep THC's wife (a UO friend of mine) up to date on the situation. Days later, Mr. Leverett emails me again and confirms that GM Clyde did in fact act outside of the guidelines for non-interference with the shard and its players - and he asked if I would have THC (or his wife) contact him.<br><br>Contact was made, and Mr. Leverett called them personally on the telephone to ask what he could do; the result being that THC will find himself, at the next login, alive and well in his tower, with a full set of ranger armor. Mr. Leverett apologized for the incident, and said that it had been reported to the GM leads and the full GM staff would be briefed on this issue.<br><br>Because I was not the account holder for THC, he would not divulge to me whether the character was actually macroing or not. THC swears that he was simply afk and not using any skills - we may never know.<br><br>My point is not to bash GM Clyde publicly, nor is it to rub mud in the eye of the GM staff. Rather, I think this story is a victory both for Origin as well as the players of UO. If you have a question or problem with the actions of any GM, there are people at Origin who are not only happy to assist you, but will go out of their way to ensure that the situation is investigated fairly, and restitution are made when appropriate.<br><br>I think I feel just a tiny bit better about UO than I did before, and I wish we had more people like Mr. William Leverett working at Origin.</font><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944053477,54264,"></a>

From this very site, back in July:<br><br><font color="FF7777">EVERYONE I talk to is moving to Siege Perilous. People are talking about selling established characters on other shards, knowing that they are gonna be on SP full time. BEFORE THE SHARD IS EVEN UP. In fact, I know quite a few folks who are re-activating their accounts to start on this shard. Why is it so popular?<br><br>Simple - no twinks.<br><br>This shard is going to be hard as hell to get started on. Think about it folks - how are you going to get money? How are you going to go bash on your first orc? With that practice sword? I don't think so. So go buy a sword from the NPC vendors... I dare you. What? It costs 190gp and you only started with 100gp? Gee. Guess someone has a problem.<br><br>So basically, the only folks who are going to be established here are the hardest of the hardcore. No more macroing tailoring skullcaps. No more going to your buds who have castles chock full of platemail for outfitting. Hell, no more castles - those deeds cost a cool THREE MILLION GOLD. Guild membership is a requirement, they may as well ask what guild you're in when you roll up a new character.<br><br>You going to be a merchant? Fine (and they will rule this shard), but that's what you are... no mules, unless you have a second or third account (and truthfully, not many of us are that ate up, including myself). You going to be a mage or alchy? Fine, but I hope you have a LOT of money saved up for reagents.<br><br>You going to be a PK? Heh heh heh. Hope you can run when the tables turn, boy, because Mister Kal Ort Por is out of business.<br><br>I predict the server will be FLOODED the first couple of days -- then, as it sets in exactly how hard it will be to get started, the total number of people on will drop tremendously. But those who are left are going to have a riot.<br><br>This is a pretty shrewd move for the UO dev team. UO's strengths over EQ lie in its cooperative/PvP environment and in its economy. Siege Perilous is the undiluted-heroin version of both of those. The economy will be 100% player driven... the ONLY way to make money in bulk will be from other players, or 200gp at a time from monsters. That's it, folks. Everything else is up to you. Player vendors will be HUGE. Selling everything from equipment (and finally, non-exceptional equipment will have a player market now) to reagents to the little things... like backpacks. You really want to pay an NPC 250gp for a backpack? Didn't think so.<br><br>And this server will be the PvP equivalent of the major leagues. Simply put, if you think you're a badass in UO, you are going to be on Siege Perilous. If you aren't on SP, you won't be shit. Because you can't compete. And everyone will know it.</font><br><br>OK. What happened?<br><br>Let's look at what attracted everyone to Siege when it first booted up:<ul><li><b>A PvP-oriented shard.</b> No stat loss, no recall. This pretty much worked as advertised; most of the people on Siege are in it for the fight. The problem here, though, is that the introduction of Rate Over Time alienated the PvPers who were stuck as permanewbies when they tried the system. RoT was poorly documented, misunderstood, and wildly unpopular. So the planned migration of every PvPer and their dog to Siege failed to occur.<li><b>A player-run economy.</b> This has to be counted as a failure. Since the target audience for Siege was hardcore UO players, almost every member of that target audience had multiple accounts, defeating the purpose of the one-character-per-shard rule. Muling still occured, and pure merchant characters (as opposed to merchant mules) became both far less common and far less needed. Since merchants were far less needed, no guild felt any need to adopt/protect them. Why bother? They already had their own mules. Thus pure merchants were relegated to strictly in-town characters, and as time progressed more and more gave up. More and more player-run vendors are empty now.<li><b>Inherent difficulty of shard acts as a filter for problem players.</b> This worked to an extent, but the SUN dupe affair showed pretty conclusively that the twinks were on Siege in force as well.</ul>Siege as it stands is fairly inhospitable to new characters. Established guilds such as CE and UDL basically own the landscape, and wipe out anyone who dares pop up in their terror-tory. Very few "anti" guilds have appeared; the most powerful are tamer guilds, and they are scorned by the red guilds who can't have 20 dragons of their own on call. <br><br>Resource-rich areas, such as mining zones and forests, are regularly patrolled by PK guilds who wipe out anyone who actually thought they'd be self-sufficient. And, most importantly, the RoT system is unbelievably punishing to new characters. <br><br>A newbie stuck at 50 swords and 50 tactics has almost no chance of advancement; dungeons and spawning grounds are pretty much occupied 24/7 by PK guilds, all of whose members are now approaching the 7x GM mark. RoT is great if you're pushing the skill cap; if you're a newbie <b>it doesn't work</b>.<br><br>Origin's response has been pretty limited. Siege is locked down as it is, they're happy with it, and most importantly, they aren't going to spend any more time developing it. So there you go.<br><br>It was a worthwhile experiment, anyway.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem944050420,9414,"></a>
