  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm sorry, I tried. But E3 just 
    beat the living crap out of me and sent me home to Momma. The lights, the 
    screaming, the beeping, the $2.75 Diet Cokes and $7.95 salads, the pedestrians 
    who honestly don't give a crap if people run them over, the bad Nirvana cover 
    bands that play next door to meeting rooms, it's just all too goddam much. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, actually there wasn't too 
    much scheduled, and what was scheduled, um, didn't happen. A planned meeting 
    with Serafina Pechan this morning fell through, although I ran into the thundering 
    Atriarch herd later -- literally, the entire Atriarch team moved about en 
    masse in Atriarch t-shirts and descended on random website ranters demanding 
    that I ask them questions. I didn't know. My brain hurt. The only question 
    I had was would I ever feel my feet again. I asked them if they liked PK switches. 
    Hah, they sneered condescendingly. We don't need PK switches because no one 
    ever dies! (Well, they do, but it's hard.) Obviously I was confused and lost, 
    so I fled. The various alien thingies on the back of the Atriarch dev team 
    laughed and laughed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was also supposed to meet the 
    illustrious Doctor TwistEr and, shamed into humility by the humanizing action 
    of meeting him face to face, realize that we are all brothers and that, dammit, 
    together we <b><i>would</i> </b>get Betsy Sue's farmhouse built before the 
    harvest. Unfortunatly Dr. T. stood me up. Damn them all to hell! I did get 
    to meet J., but he's like the light side of the TwistEr force, so it doesn't 
    really count. Oh well, I will continually miscapitalize his name in my own 
    TwistEd revenge. Hah, I say! I did get to meet Jason Booth, lead artiste over 
    at Turbine, and after a secret meeting I am authorized to announce this: Jason 
    Booth is cool. There, now don't tell me I'm not producing hard news.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later the entire MMORPG community 
    - literally - descended on some hilariously overpriced Italian restaraunt 
    where half were promptly turned away for not being Swedish enough or something. 
    I don't understand L.A., and I don't pretend to. I spent most of the evening 
    at a table with Scott &quot;Samwise&quot; Kurtz, Den Dragon of Stratics, Raph 
    &quot;Raph&quot; Koster and Jeff &quot;Knight&quot; Anderson, whom I let know 
    that guilds were REALLY GOOD IDEAS and would probably go into future detail 
    later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyway today was a light day, so 
    we should have a heavy day tomorrow, being the law of swingsets or something. 
    I don't know. My brain's fried. Here, have some pictures.</font></p>
