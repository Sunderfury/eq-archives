        of you who want to read no more of this awful website than you absolutely 

        positively have to, we at LumCentral (&quot;Developing libellous websites 

        since 1999!&quot;) have developed a system of unique pictograms in each 

        news header, useable even by the functionally illiterate, to designate 

        at a glance whether or not you actually want to read a news update. Perfect 

        for the busy executive on the go!</font></p>
