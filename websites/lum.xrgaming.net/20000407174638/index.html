In addition to violating our agreement, selling or auctioning accounts, characters, items and/or coin violates our legal rights and may constitute misappropriation, interference with our contract with the users who quit in frustration, and tarnishes the goodwill in the EverQuest name.<br><br>The User Agreement and Software License, which you choose to affirmatively accept every time you reenter the game, prohibits the sale of accounts, characters, items and/or coin -- whether by auction (e.g. eBay) or otherwise. The User Agreement, in sections 1 and 7, prohibits the transfer of an EverQuest account and software, and in sections 6 and 10 prohibits, among other things, gameplay which is inappropriate and actions which place an unreasonably large load on our infrastructure.  Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement provide that we own all property rights in the game, subject to your license to play the game.<br><br>To further emphasize these points, effective immediately, the following language shall be added to the end of section 8 of the User Agreement and as a section in the EverQuest rules of conduct:<br><br>You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material.</font><br><br>I personally think that "eBay farming" -- turning what should be a game into a profit-making enterprise -- is one of the fastest ways to destroy any online game.

E-BAY</b></font><br><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><i>Thursday, April 6, 2000 - 10:48 AM</i> [Filed by <a href="mailto:bob@interfold.com">great bob</a>]</i></font><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">In the bad craziness of the great EQ debate over privacy, another big story was overlooked.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material."</font><br><br>E-bay no more?  Is this a wave of the future?  Can it work?  Will other companies follow suit?  Let's take a peak into the good, the bad and the ugly of this situation.<br><br><b>The Good</b><br><br>There was once a time when one could actually buy a house deed, and have a chance of placing it.  I know, this sounds like fiction, but it was true.  When players left the game they actually allowed their homes to decay.  Then came E-bay.  OSI nodded and winked at the auctions, and the population became homeless overnight...unless, of course, they were wiling to shell out some benjamins. Suddenly, the dynamic changed, and the good intentions of the Dev team with regard to finite rescources crumbled. If you're leaving the game, why sell your house for in game gold when you could get some beer money?  This folks, is a no brainer.  In EQ, camping became more than a playstyle.  It became a job.<br><br><b>The Bad</b><br><br>So should we pop open the champaign corks just yet?  Well, let's think about this.  You see, <i>people who have lives don't have time to sit in front of a computer screen playing a damn game 6 hours a day</i>.  I know this can be tough to relate to.  After all, when we get home from work we play these games.  At work we load up Lum's and other web sites.  We are not normal people.  Should games be playable only by those with obsesive compulsive traits?  Let's say you make 20 dollars an hour at your job.  Now imagine an ingame object that costs 36,000 gold.  If you make 6,000 gold an hour in game, you're looking at 6 hours of labor.  That's 120 dollars in real world money, folks.  Given that, does it make any sense <i>not</i> to just purchase a 7xGM character with a house for 400 dollars?  You see, <i>these games aren't that much fun at early levels</i>.  UO is the worst offender.  Try making a new character on a new shard.  Tell me how long before you just get bored of the character building aspects. People pay thousands of dollars for hobbies like golf or fishing.  Why not MMORPGs?<br><br><b>The Ugly</b><br><br>The biggest problem, however, boils down to one of enforcement.  Is Verant going to be monitoring E-bay?  Web pages?  IRC chats?  Everytime a character gives an item of value to another player, will they launch an investigation?  Perhaps Verant should take a hard look at OSI's attempt to end macroing.  <i>As long as an object in game has "value" people are going to try an profit from it</i>.  It's in our nature as people to assign value to our posessions.<br><br>The medium of online games is evolving.  Every decision made by a company should be looked at closely.  This one bears a special level of scrutiny.  Do we flock to the banner of "mad" Richard and embrace the notion of real world money for in game value, or do we take Verant's lead and try to put a stop to it once and for all?

Yesterday was PvP day (as opposed to the usual Player vs Company that we treasure so much at LumCorp). Here's the manifesto he posted:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">A large part of my goal with the PvP changes is to try and encourage incorporating various, diverse tactics to successfully engage in PvP. Simply thnking away with a bow or running with a sword and shield without changing up your tactics should not, in my opinion, win you battles though of course if that's the style you choose you should still be able to stay in the fight without getting blown away in the first 20 seconds. <br><br>With all the new tactics, various characters can be built to have their own strengths and tactics. I can imagine one character with Fencing and Archery. Stun your opponent with a spear early on, whip out your poisoned kryss, poison them, then keep beating on them with that spear. Maybe throw in a well-timed purple potion when you think they are about to cast that In Vas Mani and interupt them or at least get in that residual damage while firing away from a distance with your bow and healing up with bandages.<br><br>Or make a Wrestler/Macer character. Disarm your opponent, stun him on occasion and crack his skull with the war hammer or beat his armor off with that war mace while blocking his damage with a shield.<br><br>And of course all the Mage variations you can think of.<br><br>At any rate, what I am getting at is the goal with the PvP changes are to encourage diversity in style and tactics that don't center around a standard one or two clones and well established combos and all else being worth nothing.<br><br>Of course there are probably several things that need to be adjusted to reach that goal fully and if you have ideas on what those adjustments need to be, I welcome you to send me your thoughts.</font><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000214.html">Well, you heard the man.

(Say it isn't so, Lum!)<br><br>Up until yesterday, I thought that Verant's plan for Kunark suffered from "Level 50 Fixation". All the development work we've seen (and most of the questions asked by users) focused on the new 51-60 level curve -- new spells, supposed new "abilities" (like skills, only harder to use, I gather), new zones, etc. <br><br>This doesn't really impress casual players (like, say, <b>me</b>) who don't have the time nor the total lack of anything else to do necessary to achieve level 50. Yes, some of us are still piddling around with our lowbies, running away from griffins, jumping up and down when we actually loot a bronze weapon, and laughing our asses off at those 300 people milling around Lower Guk waiting for a poor froggie to begin his short, painful 3 seconds of life.<br><br>Thankfully, Verant is apparently adding stuff for those slow learners among us. Things like a <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/necromancer/spelldescriptions.asp?SpellID=328">Defoliant</a> spell for Necros, apparently for the jungles in Kunark. (Something in me <b>really</b> likes the thought of a necro with napalm.) <br><br>Despite what you read on message boards, there are folks in EQ who <b>don't</b> mindlessly powerlevel to the top as fast as they inhumanly can. It's good to see that normal players are getting some goodies, too.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000213.html">Lowbies of the world unite!

I think that we could definitely have done a better job explaining what it was we were doing, and that would have lead to a bit more buy-in. Instead, some people decided to make up reports that we were scanning directory trees (false), internet files (false), internet history (false), cookies (false), and email (false), and unfortunately many people believed them. <br><br>The general paranoia resulted from the assumption that we (meaning: our servers) were actively collecting information from your system. This simply wasn't the case. The client simply would examine a small subset of information on your system, none of it containing information personally identifiable to a third party, and only send it to our server in the event that you were "running" an illegal program at the same time you ran EQ. We had absolutely no interest in what was installed on your system, only what you were running when you connected to ours. <br><br>I think privacy is important as well, but I don't really care about what a piece of client software is doing on my system. I only care when that piece of client software is transmitting information from my system to an outside source. In this case, the only time any data transmission was to take place was when something bad was found by the client. There was to be no server-side analysis of raw data. I'm sure that most people would agree that we do have a right to insure that our software license is being complied with. <br><br>In any case, I guess it's water under the bridge now. I'll blame Hollywood for all of the misunderstandings</font><br><br>Gee, a bit bitter, are we? Once again, for the slow readers in the audience, the problem was not with Verant "enforcing compliance of their software license", but in modifying said license so that compliance could be <b>anything they said it was</b>. <br><br>Yes, some folks posted alarmist and (in my belief) untrue reports of Verant scooping up IE cache data and sending it back to their servers. The problem isn't that Verant is doing this -- the problem is that, with the proposed general "we can do what we want" language proposed, <i><b>they could</b></i>, legally. Say, to check eBay cookies to look for people violating Verant's EULA in that fashion.<br><br>In any event, Verant came to their senses, and no doubt will actually try to modify their client-server protocol to not send everything blindly to the client instead of mauling the privacy rights of their users.

The first stage will not begin as soon as the shard is published. We will announce at a later date when each stage will start. <br><br>Stage 1 will last a few days. <br>Only Castles and Keeps can be placed.<br><br>Stage 2 will last approximately a week, following stage 2. <br>All house larger than the small house (this includes towers, larger two-story houses, large brick houses, and patio houses), can be placed. The new larger houses (all but the small shops and the small tower) are included in this stage. Castles and Keeps can be placed at this time as well (space permitting). <br><br>Stage 3 will begin after stage 2 is complete. <br>All houses of any size may be placed.

(The complete log is <a href="http://antoniusbayle.tripod.com/smed.txt">here</a>).<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I want to let everyone know we are reconsidering this decision. We're doing an in-game poll tomorrow.<br><br>We do NOT scan people's hard drives. We never have. All we do is check to see if they are running things like WinShowEQ.<br><br>I'm actually surprised about this to tell the truth.. UO has the same thing in their agreement. 5 (e) of their agreement.<br><br>Clearly I underestimated people's reaction to this.<br><br>Lets see what tomorrow brings. I'm reconsidering even putting it in at all.</font><br><br>Later, Brad McQuaid, Everquest's lead designer and Holder of the Vision, and Sony/SCEA's director of legal and business affairs, who drafted the EULA changes were in the same channel. I got the opportunity to fire off a few questions (here's the <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/eqlog1.html">complete log</a> of that session). Sony's lawyer, on as "SonyEsq", had this to say:<br><br><font color="#77FF77"><i>What protections do users have against Verant unilaterally declaring what is "appropriate" for monitoring?</i><br><br>The limitations are twofold. First, the information that is examined is strictly limited to that which is game related. For instance, no one would insist that Verant not examine the EQ directories during its patch routine. Because, if Verant did not peek, then it would have to patch the entire game every time it patches. So, it looks to see what needs updating, and updates.<br><br>Now, secondly, there is a reasonableness standard. The standard of reasonableness is not a subjective one, it is an objective one. That means, (this is gonna sound like a pile of legalese, but I didn't write 200 years of common law). That means that it is what a "reasonable person, acting with knowledge of professionals in the industry, would adjudge as fair."<br><br>So it is Verant's intention, in taking any of these steps, to only do what is necessary and reasonable to protect the integrity of its game.  Certainly, no more.</font><br><br>The poll question is already on the EQ Gameplay board. It reads as follows:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Are you comfortable with the EverQuest client checking to see if you are running programs that are capable of cheating in EverQuest and reporting that back to our servers?</font><br><br>Um, sorry, <b>that's not the issue.</b> Everyone agrees that Verant has a right to defend the integrity of their game against third-party programs; everyone agrees that a more tightly-worded EULA would cause far less of a firestorm. The problem is that, at first glance, Verant is giving themselves the right to determine what is appropriate to examine on your PC. That is the key problem here, and a question that is phrased to elicit a "ooh, cheaters bad" response isn't quite kosher. (To Smedley's credit, in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030461.html">thread</a> he did promise to continue alternate wording.)<br><br>Also, Smedley noted that UO's EULA had the same sort of we-can-snoop-whatever-we-want clause. The clause he refers to is:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">(e) Privacy. You understand that you have no expectation of privacy regarding the communications you make on the Service, and that all communications made by or received from you may be monitored by Origin Systems representatives. You hereby consent to the extraction of hardware system profile data and any data related to operation of the Software through the Service from any computer that logs on to the Service using your Account.</font><br><br>Not quite the same thing. And, as any UOE user over the past two years can tell you, OSI hasn't done any process checking in <b>their</b> client.<br><br>But then again, when you're caught with your hands in the cookie jar, the first impulse is usually to point at someone else.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000211.html">Continue the discussion on Verant's new EULA</a></b></font><br><br>
