    CAN ALWAYS BORROW MY COPYRIGHT LAWYER, KEVIN MURPHY OF THE MUSHROOM</font></font></b></font></P>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not going to be many updates this 

    weekend as I take a well-deserved break from online zaniness while I wait 

    patiently, *oh* so patiently on my new PC to be shipped. (PIII 450 Bay-beeeeee! 

    Now I many actually be able to run Everquest.) So I'll be spending most of 

    the weekend PC time instead playing Might &amp; Magic 7, which my feeble P200 

    can actually run. (It's a lot like Everquest, only with not nearly as much 

    killstealing.)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wanted to touch on this latest 

    Sooper D00per <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">Dr. 

    TwisTer ExpoSe</a> with <a href="http://www.uo.com/">Stratics</a>. Stratics 

    are the Army of Light, as far as I'm concerned. They know more about UO then, 

    well, UO does (I recall a UOHoC Chat where DD said, incredulously, &quot;you 

    mean archers can drink potions with bows equipped?&quot;). If you are a number 

    cruncher, a powergamer, or just wanted to know how many years it would take 

    to make GM Smith, you probably have Stratics on your bookmark list. Unfortunately, 

    it now seems that they also like lawyers.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. TwisTer seems to have discovered 

    that Stratics doesn't like to publish information that reflects negatively 

    on OSI. Well golly gee, Mr. Bill, whatever gave you that clue. I guess the 

    fact that they resolutely refuse to ever mention the words &quot;Dr. TwisTer&quot; 

    never gave you a clue. (They also refuse to acknowledge I exist either, but 

    hey, I can live with this. I'm a reasonably well adjusted web guy. Hell, I 

    can always e-mail <a href="mailto:ctaylor@origin.ea.com">Neve Campbell</a> 

    if I get lonely. SHE admits that I exist. So NYAH, Stratics.) </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will say that the good folks 

    at Stratics, who I ordinarily have the greatest respect for even if they won't 

    acknowledge my existence, are acting with all the good sense of crazed hyenas 

    here. Obviously, they didn't want to publish this interview. They also, as 

    is standard among journalists, gave their interviewee a copy of the interview, 

    before said decision was made. Both of which make sense. However, when the 

    interviewee publishes that interview, Stratics doesn't have a whole hell of 

    a lot of room to bitch. While they can go on about copyright law and the like, 

    there were two parties in the room when that interview went down, and one 

    of them put it on his web site. While I will freely admit to not being a lawyer 

    (I bow to the journalistic acumen of <a href="http://www.themushroom.com/">my 

    betters</a> on that), it does seem that their continuing to throw their weight 

    around in such a heavy-handed fashion is not only counter-productive, but 

    throws more raw meat TwisTer's way. The smartest thing for UOSS, Inc. (my 

    god, is there such a thing...?) to do is to, um, shut up and let it die. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But no one ever does that. And 

    what do I know? I just run this silly rant site.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did say I hacked into their

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then when I made that comment

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the time that this story played

      (supposedly) to get rid of me. GameHut laughed at them. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course if you want the real

      more of my page later on when some key members of the guild left, and uncovered

    <p><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Vote For Me </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">- After 

      looking over the poll that is being done right now a little closer, it does 

      appear that it is kinda strange. Obviously someone started the poll from 

      Sonoma, considering the top 10 individuals are from Sonoma. Also, some of 

      the great people of the UO world have just STARTED to appear. For instance, 

      </FONT><A HREF="http://imanewbie.crossroadsrpg.com/">ImaNewbie</A><FONT

 COLOR="#ffffff"> is now located on the poll after I posted this information yesterday. 

      Could it be that Ima reads my site? If so, GREAT, I love </FONT><A HREF="http://imanewbie.crossroadsrpg.com/">ImaNewbie</A><FONT

 COLOR="#ffffff">. I don't know HOW many times I laughed out loud from the comics. 

      Trully, Ima is one of the Greats of UO. If you haven't read his comics </FONT><A HREF="http://imanewbie.crossroadsrpg.com/">click 

      here</A><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">. Anyways, the reason I'm spending some time 

      on this subject is actually for another reason. Yes, you can still vote 

      for me, please do, and it does appear that you get a vote a day, so why 

      not stuff the box with extra votes...after all we are cheaters. But the 

      real reason you want to do this, is because of the members that are already 

      at the top of the list. Despite my friends </FONT><A HREF="http://www.xsploitz.com/c%26s/">CrAsHeR 

      &amp; SmAsHeR</A><FONT COLOR="#ffffff"> and their Real Audio Show, the other 

      top 10s are Role Players. Now hear my cry, it's not me you are voting for, 

      but what I stand for. We MUST work together and beat out these Role Players. 

      How fitting would our work be to see Exploiters beat out the Role Players. 

      So I urge you, one and all, Vote for me, for a better UO world. </FONT><A HREF="http://www.freevote.com/votingbooth?uobestofbest">Vote

    <p><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Best of the Best</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff"> - Recently, 

      there have been some messages appearing on my board, claiming to be better 

      than me, claiming to be in first place in a recent poll for the most famous 

      players in UO. I was kinda curious however to find out just WHO was in first 

      place. I never heard of him, I mean, ImaNewbie is more famous to me then 

      this guy. All in all My opinion, who cares. Until I read this. You must 

      have forgotten who you are messing with - The best of the best &amp; ....a 

      hacker. I ran accross an interesting note while searching through the Syndicate's 

      private forum section for their guild members. How - you may ask did I get 

      into it? Figure it out yourself.</FONT></p>

    <p><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">4) Vote: Please spend 5 seconds voting at: <BR>

      http://www.freevote.com/votingbooth?uobestofbest We are in 1st place now 

      by 156 votes HOWEVER the #2 person continues to rise. Fortunatley despite 

      his cheating we are winning and extending our lead by playing by the RULES. 

      Funny how that seems to work out We play by the rules in all things and 

      still come out on top I appreciate everyones voting efforts. A day or two 

      more and ill stop harassing you so much :P ill still mention it but the 

      push wont be as big to pull out ahead as we will have secured a comfortable 

      lead and enough will keep voting everyday to keep us there. But for now, 

      we NEED you to vote for a couple days more.</FONT></p>

    <p><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">On another day I found this posted - Which is totally 

      false.</FONT></p>

    <p><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">2) Voting: We added bout 120 new votes yesterday. 

      We soared into the lead by 70 votes. However, the #3 person, Twister, is 

      using an IP cloaker (so Ive been &quot;hinted at by the siteop) and added 

      90 for himself. Thats pretty cheesy dont you think? We have actual real 

      people voting. He has a program cloaking himself. LAME!!</FONT></p>

    <p><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Just because I run a bug site, doesn't mean that 

      I am cheating in this poll. If anyone is cheating it would be the #1 person, 

      who is clearly above the #2 person by 200 votes. I've said it once and I 

      will say it again...what is the point in cheating in a poll that means nothing. 

      If I really wanted to cheat, you wouldn't even have a chance. Just look 

      at how easy it was to get into your private message board. Now, I have never 

      been one to start a major debate between boards. I even started this site 

      because of all of the whining that UOShack and Xsploitz was doing with each 

      other. None the less, I give up. You win. You are #1, and better than I 

      will ever be. Wow...that was a really super neat o poll. Thanks to all for 

      playing. Now back to reality and information that trully effects our lives.</FONT></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, we all know how pathetic Dr. 

    TwisTer is about popularity polls. I mean, he's been pimping &quot;<a href="http://www.worldcharts.com/windex.html">the 

    Internet Web Top 100</a>&quot;, which is basically a scam to get easily manipulated 

    webmasters such as himself to command their loyal userbase to vote early and 

    often, so that the &quot;pollsters&quot; get more <a href="http://apps.flycast.com/webkit/main.cgi?992112">ad

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is where it gets interesting. 

    According to a source of mine, this &quot;l33t hax0ring&quot; was not recieved 

    too well by the folks who run their web site. They went to TwisTer's ISP. 

    TwisTer then moved his site. Now, I used to work at an ISP, and generally 

    we did bust the little scallywags who caused us to actually expend time and 

    effort responding to people's bitching about their activities. However, we 

    didn't let them keep an account. <a href="http://members.home.com/drtwister/">@home 

    did</a>. Unless he got a new one in the interim, which I doubt. Still, the 

    timing is interesting -- a week after he posted that, he moved the site.</font></p>

    of some folks involved in an argument with SRC Boots over on Chesapeake. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is of note is that Stratics 

    apparently found out about it, and urged TwisTer not to publicize it. Apparently 

    the good folks at Stratics REALLY wanted TwisTer to publish this story, since 

    that is probably the quickest way I can think of to urge him to do it. What 

    is funny is that the story involves <i>those awful roleplayers! </i>Yes, TwisTer 

    actually rolled up his pants legs and waded into that psychotic murk that 

    is the UO Role Player. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I look forward to further stories 

    from TwisTer covering this community. In my personal experience on Great Lakes, 

    hardcore roleplayers are ...interesting folks. They tend to be very passionate 

    about the game, very intolerant of anyone who doesn't behave precisely as 

    they would like them to, and - this is probably the one thing on which they

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...which came to the attention 

      of OSI and the UO community via the investigation by Nighthawk... </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...who had just lost his tower 

      in a suspicious incident following a banning that OSI had decided to make 

      temporary even before his lame 'protest'... </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...and was now shopping for UO 

      real estate. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other words, all that crap 

      that he would NEVER EVER USE is so important to him, that spending $800+ 

      to get a place to put more crap seems to be a logical endeavor. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Thursday June 17, 1999 <br>

      Still no tower </i></font></p>

    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OSI has potentially cost me 

      a lot of money. Not silly UO money, I mean actual cash. Since I haven't 

      gotten my tower back and I have several roommates, I may have to shell out 

      rl cash to get the tower back (since it was my banning that left them homeless). 

      </font></i></p>

    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you casn tell by this EBay 

      auction, that would end up costing me over $700 if I wanted to buy one. 

      I mean, it's unheard of to punish me in this mannor for saying the word 

      "jap". Lets be honest, they admitted they made an error with the banning 

      by reversing it. I would think they'd replace the tower since obviously 

      it shouldn't have been removed to begin with. </font></i></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--- </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone willing to pay $700 for 

      a UO house really needs his or her priorities checked. Let alone these people 

      who pay $2000 or more for the really jacked up accounts. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ultimately, it's a lot like paying

    5:30 PM </i><b>AS PROMISED, UNEDUCATED AND SHALLOW OPINIONS ABOUT ASHERON'S 

    CALL </b></font></P>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I haven't devoted a whole lot of 

    time to Asheron's Call, but I have dabbled in it a bit. Here's what I've picked 

    up on. Note that these are the impressions of a confirmed newbie and are all 

    probably wrong as hell.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The interface is professionally 

    done; it beats UO hands down, and it is literally painful to go back to EQ 

    afterwards. Your health, mana and stamina bars are shown at the top of the 

    screen, the chat screen (a la EQ) is on the bottom, and in between is a 3D 

    view of your environment, again similar to EQ. You can call up a control panel 

    on the right third of your screen, which displays all the information you 

    need, such as your paperdoll, your skills, your spells, a help system, etc, 

    in a nice tabbed window. Unlike EQ, there is ZERO delay in calling up your 

    control panel. It is all seamless and FAST. While I can <i>barely</i> run 

    EQ in 640x480 mode on my P200, I can run AC in 800x600 mode comfortably.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The graphics are kind of bland. 

    This is less the fault of the engine, which is capable enough, than of the 

    artists. I'm spoiled by EQ here; after wandering around the claustrophobic 

    alleyways of Qeynos and the marble spires of Erudin, the towns of Dereth (Asheron 

    Call's world) are just blah. This is something that sorely needs attention 

    -- the best engine in the world won't save it without creativity behind it. 

    </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, I freely note that there 

    may be hugely dramatic vistas in game - I couldn't find them. In my 6 or 7 

    hours of play I went through the newbie dungeon (a ritual familiar to those 

    veterans of text-based muds) and whacked at rats outside. That's about all 

    I could find to do. A real dungeon would have been nice, or even a wandering 

    orc tribe or something. Dereth is BIG and there's no sign posts pointing &quot;THIS 

    WAY TO CERTAIN DEATH&quot;. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Character creation - this is how 

    EQ SHOULD have been done. You can customize your character to the Nth degree, 

    down to the color and cut of his/her newbie clothing. No 5-archetypes-to-choose-from-per-race 

    here. (The races, by the way, are human races, not fantasy ones. Thinly disguised 

    Europeans, Arabs and Japanese; although you can freely set your skin tone 

    to whatever you wish, the facial features you can choose from - and there 

    are a lot - remain those of your ethnicity.) </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Character advancement is a canny 

    blend of the best of EQ and UO. While you advance in levels, those levels 

    are more guide markers than anything else (although they do allow you eventually 

    to designate more skills that your character specializes in.) What is really 

    neat is that you can use the experience points you earn by spending them on 

    skill gain. This would be akin to going out and killing a few balrons in UO 

    so that you can finally make GM Blacksmith. Of course, there are no trade 

    skills in AC yet; those are Promised For Later.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The magic system looks hideously 

    complex and I hadn't even touched it yet. Basically, from what I read, you 

    can build your own spells, and their expense and effectiveness depend on what 

    other player mages are doing with their spells. Raph Koster would love this 

    magic system. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet, though.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The coolest part of the game is 

    the guild/fealty system. Basically, you can recruit other players to be your 

    vassals and they earn experience for you, even while you're offline. So if 

    you want to just be a full time Pimp Lord and can convince 16 other people 

    to do your heavy lifting for you, the game can do that. You can even construct 

    your own medieval version of the pyramid scheme, where your vassals can recruit 

    <i>their </i>vassals and everyone kicks in a little to the Man aka you. This 

    is going to make guildmasters very, very happy. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall - it's a very complex game 

    system, more so than UO and definitely more so than EQ. Not for beginners, 

    I'd wager. However, the folks at Turbine have been taking notes, and AC does 

    deliver the best of both worlds. If they can carry it off and fix a couple 

    of key things (such as newbie accessibility, graphics and noncombat skills), 

    when the game launches you will see me there full time.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some classes in EQ are considered 

    broken because they cannot be Tank Mages. This includes Warriors, who actually 

    have a valid beef, since at higher levels they fight no better than Rangers 

    and Paladins who have Other Neat Things, and Rogues. My first EQ character 

    was a rogue; I figured out rapidly that it was a pretty futile exercise. <a href="http://boards.vaultnetwork.com/showpost.pl?Board=veeshan&amp;Number=476&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5">It 

    took this guy a lot longer.</a></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the way, one of the few people 

    you hear bitching about their classes are Shamen. This is of course, because 

    I play a Shaman, and everyone wants, subconsciously, to be as cool as I.</font></p>

    <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hello Lum, </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.accessgate.net/howard/"><img src="mu-gabriel.jpg" width="129" height="85" align="right" alt="Blame Mu. He made me do it." border="0"></a>I 

      am the Gm who goes by the alias of Gm Gabriel. I am writing this to ask 

      that you remove my picture from your webpage. Gm Darwin never went to the 

      player luncheon that the picture was taken from. I was one of the "8 GMs, 

      all in various stages of body piercing, none of which were old enough to 

      order drinks legally, stared morosely at each other, radiating waves of 

      "they-told-me-to-be-here-they-didn't-tell-me-to-like-it-goddamit". " When 

      you take down my picture, could you please leave a note that there was a 

      mistake made. I don't wish to be accosted outside of the Origin building 

      by anyone thinking I am Gm Darwin. Thank you. </font></p>
