Would you therefore argue based on that that instead of the current designed system there should be stat loss words and non stat loss words - is that a fair statement?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If so I think you have given the stamp of disaproval of what is being done to all the other shards.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What I particularly dont like about the faction system and most of the land changes is that it divides UO into two groups - one group basically gets to call the shots everywhere and the other group is basically being told *we dont want you* and at the same time *oh but the faction system will be cool*&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I know you opposed rep, I know you oppose stat loss as a punishment for killing innocents - I think you, Fey and others who play Siege are selling out the rest of the players.  Part of me wants to write them off to - after all they are to damn lazy to play siege but really who am I to tell them they HAVE to move? who are you? who is OSI? &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The goal of this should be to make money - the faction system isnt going to be a money maker - people arent going to flock to play it - they will flock to be never in danger from pks and they will flock to hardcore pvp - its a shame both cant be happy and that so many unhappy folks are basically told thanks but we know whats best for you.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I see absolutely no problem with spliiting the two lands and making them 100% seperate - because they always will be anyway.  Free movement between the two is a problem not a good thing because its more of the non long term consequences for pvp - join a faction - tonight we will take a break from faction fighting and take it easy over on pvp- side.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I personally think the regular shards are doomed for pvp after this because of the splitting of the lands - I think Siege is going to rock the house and fill up.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have to be honest if it wasnt for siege you would quit UO - I would quit UO - we both know neither of us would like the faction system with stat loss.  Its kinda hard to say you support something and at the same time refuse to play in it.  Its kinda like congress making laws they arent subject to.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
