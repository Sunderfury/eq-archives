      Dragon (you may have heard of him, he works at some hi-tech company in Austin 

      and hangs out with &quot;Dr.&quot; Twister on Dollar Draft nights at Hooters)

        everyone stops macroing, then the advancement rates of skills will rise. 

        Less macroing actually will mean less NEED to macro. Because of how the 

        advancement table works, the reason certain skills advance so slowly is 

        precisely BECAUSE they have been macroed. </i></font></p>

      <p align="left"><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just 

        more fuel for the fire. :)</font></i></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, DUH.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I think 

      I've made clear over and again, this relates to PvP mostly because that's 

      mostly how I play. My wife is almost exclusively PvM (and actually lately 

      more PvFish) and she macros almost as much as I do, though. And she is a 

      HARDCORE roleplayer. So although this isn't a PK or an anti-roleplayer thing, 

      the following comes from my experiences tearing up my fellow man.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PvP is 

      a test of skill. Given everything else being equal, the guild with more 

      skillful PLAYERS will defeat their opposition. This is as it should be.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 

      if that guild ties both hands behind their back and hobbles into battle 

      armed only with a butcher knife and wearing a jester's cap for armor, they 

      will likely lose no matter how bad-assed their players may be. The stats 

      of the player's characters do come into play.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, why 

      would ANY reasonably adept PvP combatant choose to handicap themselves against 

      their opponents?</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There already 

      are ethical choices in PvP. I don't use UOE. I think UOE users are slime-infested 

      pusbags and I take great joy in watching my deadly poison cause the screen 

      to fill up with autocasted failed Kal Ort Pors. But UOE gives its users 

      an advantage. UOA users have to hit their Disarm macro button, slam Alt-H 

      to fire off a Greater Heal, and hit Home to target self. Non-enhanced users 

      have to manually drag their weapons off of their paperdoll into their backpack, 

      slam Alt-H to fire off a greater heal, and mouse over to their onscreen 

      representation and click on it. UOE users have to hit Heal Self. Guess who's 

      going to heal first.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it's 

      a fine line that you walk. Personally, my stance is that UOA is not a &quot;cheat 

      utility&quot; like UOE is, but an improvement to UO (which the dev team 

      has stated will eventually be worked into the actual client). And just because 

      OSI decided to waffle about whether or not to grant UOA &quot;legit&quot; 

      status for six months before finally giving it the thumbs down is irrelevant 

      to me. It's like Microsoft telling me I can't use Borland Delphi to program 

      Windows apps, but I have to use Microsoft Visual Basic. I suppose legally 

      they could because Microsoft owns the rights to Windows, but that doesn't 

      mean I will use an inferior tool because Microsoft tells me to. (And all 

      you C geeks just shut your damn mouth. I like pretty guis.)</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, you 

      might say, what's the difference between hitting one key in UOE and three 

      keys in UOA? It's still an advantage other players don't have.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sure. But 

      let's look at the facts. People who do pvp either use UOE, UOA, or are so 

      skilled with the client from repetitive practice they find neither necessary. 

      I'm not. I'm a klutz. I drop things on a regular basis. If you expect me 

      to fumble with my mouse for five minutes every time I have to heal myself, 

      I'm going to take a lot of dirt naps. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So do I 

      want to handicap myself? No. Is it unethical not to handicap myself? In 

      my view, my line is drawn in the correct spot. Your line may differ.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what 

      does all this have to do about macroing? It's the same drawing of the lines. 

      Where does your ethics draw your line. For me, I'm not going to unilaterally 

      disarm. Why would any sane person involved in pvp NOT macro? &quot;Well, 

      if I can get my anatomy up to 100, I get a 10% bonus on my damage dealt. 

      Everyone I fight, pretty much, in hand to hand is going to have that same 

      bonus. <i>But I don't want to macro unattended, because it would be wrong, 

      it's an exploit, and OSI said not to do it. </i>And raising Anatomy by hand 

      will take six months and drive me completely insane in the process. So I 

      guess I'll just do less damage.&quot; Do YOU know anyone who would say that? 

      I don't.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then there's 

      the bandwidth issue. I know all about bandwidth, I used to work for an ISP 

      back before I grew a clue. You've got thousands of people wasting 2K of 

      bandwidth a pop connected to the OSI servers and they're not even really 

      there. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, &quot;Designer&quot; 

      Dragon, that is YOUR fault, bud. <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/skillsessay.htm" target="_blank">You 

      designed the game that way</a>.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You implemented 

      a skill tree with logarithmic progression that cripples itself as more people 

      use each skill. Was the goal to just make less Grandmasters? Um, welcome 

      to human nature. Everyone wants to be a Grandmaster. Everyone wants to win. 

      Especially pvp'ers, who are actually playing to win as opposed to roleplayers 

      who generally are in a &quot;play&quot; environment as opposed to a &quot;contest&quot; 

      environment. (Not knocking roleplayers, mind you, I've been intimately involved 

      <a href="http://www.webtoys.net/%7Etom/" target="_blank">with</a> <a href="http://yew.webtoys.net/" target="_blank">several</a> 

      <a href="http://kazolas.crpgtavern.com/" target="_blank">such</a> <a href="http://greatlakes.webtoys.net/" target="_blank">groups</a>. 

      Both styles of play are <a href="http://mud.sig.net/raph/gaming/essay3.html" target="_blank">equally 

      valid.</a>)</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, from 

      your own <a href="http://mud.sig.net/raph/gaming/laws.html" target="_blank">rules 

      of online game design</a>, </font></p>

    <blockquote> 

      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>&quot;Macroing, 

        botting, and automation -- no matter what you do, someone is going to 

        automate the process of playing your world&quot;.</i></font></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what 

      do you do about it, smack everyone upside the head who dares to follow the 

      dictate of human nature? Depend on your fallible and underpaid GMs and even 

      more fallible and UNpaid counselors to police them? Another of your rules 

      states;</font></p>

    <blockquote> 

      <p align="left"><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 

        in-game admin faces a bizarre problem. He is exercising power that the 

        ordinary virtual citizen cannot. And he is looked to in many ways to provide 

        a certain atmosphere and level of civility in the environment. Yet the 

        fact remains that no matter how scrupulously honest he is, no matter how 

        just he shows himself to be, no matter how committed to the welfare of 

        the virtual space he may prove himself, people will hate his guts. They 

        will mistrust him precisely because he has power, and they can never know 

        him. There will be false accusations galore, many insinuations of nefarious 

        motives, and former friends will turn against him. It may be that the 

        old saying about power and absolute power is just too ingrained in the 

        psyche of most people; whatever the reasons, there has never been an online 

        game whose admins could say with a straight face that all their players 

        really trusted them.&quot;</font></i></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd add 

      a new rule. Call it &quot;Lum's Laws of Human Frailty&quot;;</font></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Given 

        enough motive, any game admin can be corrupted.<br>

        </i></font><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 

        corrupt administration is discovered, any online game will be swiftly 

        deserted.</font></i></p>

      </blockquote>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We all 

      know, all have personal experience with GM favoritism and selective enforcement 

      of ingame rules of conduct. I won't even bother to recite <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/" target="_blank">the 

      whole sad litany</a>. I only wonder when we'll pop open CNet, Gamespot, 

      or CNN and read about the GM who was slipped $5,000 under the table to create 

      an Ubercharacter that would be sold by a third party on eBay. $5,000 to 

      a kid just out of/still in college is a lot of money. And I just see the 

      current &quot;Well, we'll ban you for macroing, but only if we feel like 

      it&quot; as just another incredible enabler for ingame administrative corruption.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do 

      I think should be done? Find some way to autoboot anyone using UOE/UOA/UOWazoo. 

      Wipe the shards. Start clean. If you want to reset the skill curve, that's 

      great. But don't punish those who follow simply because they showed up too 

      late to get away with it.</font></p>

      TO PK LORD BRITISH?</b></font></font></font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you 

      read the &quot;real&quot; news sites (as opposed to the weird crap I post) 

      you know that the funky guy with the goatee and the permanent RenFair wardrobe 

      is going to grace a UO Player's Luncheon in Austin with his august majesty 

      in a couple of weeks.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, your 

      Lumness lives only one state away from Texas (I won't tell you which one 

      because you all would laugh and call me names and I'd have to take 15 AK-47s 

      and a Molotov to school the next day) so I'm seriously considering making 

      a personal appearance. Hey, that would make my trips to Austin about as 

      frequent as Lord Blackthorne's trips to Britain! </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have 

      one question I'd like to ask Mr. Garriot. It's totally serious, and in no 

      way is disrespectful, insulting, antagonistic or about macroing, but for 

      some reason I REALLY doubt I'd get a straight answer. I'll tell you what 

      it is, whether I go or not, after the meeting. (We really don't want to 

      drive all the way to Austin without tickets waiting for us. And cross country 

      driving is hard to macro.)</font></p>
