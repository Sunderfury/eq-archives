            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, 
              I was going to break this story last week when I found out that 
              a certain OSI Employee had left the company. But I decided to hold 
              out, get some more proof, and wait to see how OSI handled the situation. 
              Well they released a public statement today, which reads like this 
              :</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFF00">On 
              Thursday, June 24th, Origin Systems (OSI) was alerted to the possible 
              misconduct of an individual employed within the GM Support Department. 
              Upon investigation, OSI found reason to believe that this employee 
              was engaging in activities that breached the trust that must exist 
              between a company, its employees, and its customers. The decision 
              by OSI management in this case was immediate dismissal. All actions 
              that are taken by members of our support staff are logged and monitored, 
              and we investigate all reports of GM misbehavior that we receive. 
              We are grateful to players who bring these incidents to our attention, 
              as these reports are used to ensure that OSI representatives are 
              providing the best possible service at all times. If you believe 
              that a GM or any OSI representative is behaving in anything less 
              than the highest standard of service, we ask you to please email 
              complaints@owo.com with the details of your issue. Only the most 
              senior representatives of our support staff read this mailbox, and 
              we assure you that your issue will be thoroughly investigated. We 
              take our responsibility to our customers very seriously, and we 
              will not allow anyone --staff or otherwise-- to abuse our service 
              or our customers. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now 
              what they don't tell you, is what you all really want to know isn't 
              it? Who, and Why? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
              person, GM Darwin. Oh how I would love to say that he was let go 
              because of the situation that occurred in the weeks prior to this, 
              but that is not so. So why did he depart so abruptly afterwards? 
              It is plain and simple... read exactly what I say, because this 
              is the truth. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>GM 
              Darwin was creating house and castle deeds online, handing them 
              off to a character and then selling those deeds for REAL US$ MONEY 
              on Ebay.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Let's 
              see, where do we go from here? Let's start off by looking at a few 
              situations that occurred, and how I got my information. I have a 
              close friend who gave me the scoop. He actually helps me with this 
              site from time to time, and if you ask me if I believe him or not, 
              I would say yes. For one reason, he is a relative of mine... :) 
              - and second off, he sent me the email conversation between him 
              and GM Darwin arranging a transaction.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
              guess the best way to start this whole thing is to look at the mistakes 
              GM Darwin made. First, let's look at his Ebay account. <a href="http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewListedItems&amp;userid=imagine691&amp;include=0&amp;since=30&amp;sort=2&amp;rows=25" target="_blank">CLICK 
              HERE</a>. For those of you who need a quick calculation, that's<font color="#FF0000"> 
              <b>$7,863.89</b></font>! Mistake number 1 - How much gold have you 
              EVER at one time had on your shard? Let's say 2 million. That's 
              2 million for 2 years. Now GM Darwin, when making these transactions 
              with players, claimed that he just had alot of money. Ok, fine... 
              I give him that, but if you look at his transaction records, he 
              had 2 Million Gold on 8 DIFFERENT SERVERS!!! Think about it.....the 
              first thing that came to my mind was, he knew a dupe, or he was 
              a GM. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So 
              the email conversations began. What did you have to do, to get the 
              millions he was going to give online? Nothing!! Simply meet him 
              online, he would give you 1 million gold up front, then you pay 
              his Ebay account online, and he will get you the second million 
              gold. No questions asked. No sweat for GM Darwin.... it didn't cost 
              him anything. If you paid the cash value, he wins, if you never 
              paid the cash value, he still wins.... pretty nice little scam he 
              had going, wouldn't you say?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">See, 
              my friend recently left to play EQ. After a little departure, he 
              decided to return to UO, only to remember, he had no money. So he 
              began to check around Ebay to see what he could find. He found a 
              player offering 2 mil gold on Baja for around $300.00. Pretty good 
              exchange rate he thought, so he emailed him.</font></p>

              there, I normally trade you half the gold you want up front, and

              as we can see here, we find GM Darwin's second problem. He used 
              an email address that could tie him back to Austin, Texas, home 
              of OSI Corporate Offices. However, that isn't even the worst mistake, 
              in another letter, he used his real name.</font></p>

              am no longer employed with Origin Systems Inc. and thus this ends 
              my time in UO, as they not only blocked the two accounts they gave 
              me but, my personal one as well. Is not a problem as I could never 
              play the game again anyway. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFF00">I 
              hold no ill will toward Origin Systems Inc. as my leaving was my 
              fault. I wish you all well and, I hope you goes on to be a bigger 
              and better game. I will no longer be on ICQ and all my email addy's 
              have been changed. So this is my farewell to all the Test Center 
              players I met or even did not meet. I will not even take the time 
              to bore you with a list of all my friends I have made as the list

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFF00">No 
              longer any boards friendly flamer Tolky , Sir Gateway and GM Darwin 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
              included in the letter, his Character name : Tolky and his Real 
              Name : Kevin Roseler. I'm sure you thought it was strange, as much 
              as I did, when in his letter he stated that he left OSI because 
              it was his fault. Not only did he leave, but they banned all of 
              his characters as well.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
              think for the most part, this information speaks for itself. There 
              are obviously alot more things I could point out, and discuss with 
              you, but I feel it best to leave you with these thoughts. For all 
              of you out there that think I have some big elaborate conspiracy 
              theory against OSI, think about this situation. For those of you 
              who think I lie, or fabricate stories, read the proof. Finally, 
              for all of you out there that have always said, OSI does not have 
              corrupt GMs, and the GMS would NEVER do anything like this... well 
              here is one case that shows they can be. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It's 
              now obvious that even if his actions with my friend last week didn't 
              get him fired, he was lazy, and his personal feelings outwayed any 
              other feelings of helping players with problems. I will stick up 
              for some of the GMs out there. Several GMs have actually come to 
              me in the past few weeks expression appreciation and sharing with 
              me their true feelings regarding supporting us. There are several 
              GMs at OSI, that want nothing more than to help you, and make sure 
              that you get the service you deserve. These are the GMs that we 
              want working with us on a daily basis. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Personally, 
              I'm surprised that OSI, didn't take legal actions against him. Large 
              sum of money, could be considered theft from the company...of course 
              this gets back into the debate on when virtual items, become true 
              property. A court will sometime soon make that decision.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't know 
              what some of you are thinking, but I'm sure most of you are not 
              the least bit surprised. Despite OSI's effort to sweep things under 
              the rug, sugar coat problems and hide the truth, they continue to 
              destroy their customers trust. This time, not only have I brought 
              you the facts, but the proof to back it up. You tell me, what are 
              you going to do about this?</font></p>
