Even I, the gal who loves to stick it to Wolfpack every time she gets the chance, wouldn't make such all-encompassing statement about the game.  The truth of it is we really don't know all THAT much about the game yet.  Warden, Wolfpack's self-described 'marketing puke' has done a damn good job of bringing fanatics to a game that isn't even into beta yet.  The development boards are active -- just as active as the Crossroads boards for the big three.  There are, at last count, 12 active fan sites about the game -- 2 of which are in German.  And then there's me -- posting about it here like I actually know something about the damn game.  When in truth I don't.  Neither does anyone, really. There isn't enough information out there to fill up one fan site on the game -- much less 12.  How did everyone get so certain about this game?  <br><br>While I'm not sure that ShadowBoobs will be the next <a href="http://home.europa.com/~esk/HGrail/">Holy Grail</a> of MMORPG's that <a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/6circles.htm">many</a> seem to think it will be, neither am I certain that the game will fall flat on its virtual face.  All I am certain about, at this stage of the game, is that Warden is damned good at getting us all to talk about it.  He's probably sitting back in his cubbyhole laughing his ass off about it as I write this.  So here's a tip of the ole hat to Warden and crew for being damn good marketers.  Maybe now they will grant me a  <a href="http://cos.xrgaming.net/library/art/gfx/mystryssmyschyf_sm.jpg">fully frontal male demon</a>.  They can put it in the game and call it a myschyf.

Yet both in Everquest and Ultima Online, the folks who run the storylines seem to think that players really enjoy that sort of thing.<br><br>Everquest has always been the worst offender here. EQ has already mastered Skinnerian psychology (&#8220;hit the Ignite icon 50 times and you get a tasty treat!&#8221;) &#8211; now they are working on establishing the learned response &#8220;Roleplaying = Death&#8221;. <b>Every single time</b> a GM event has been run in Everquest, it has ended with a field of corpses. <br><br>Some will say it&#8217;s not the fault of the people running the &#8220;quests&#8221; &#8211; that in any quest, the K3wld3wds run amuck trying to kill anything that moves and most of the stuff standing still. Well, sorry, that is the fault of the game admins. Remember &#8211; EQ is the master of learned response gaming. The absolute best items in Everquest &#8211; &#8220;artifacts&#8221; &#8211; are obtainable <b>only</b> through these sort of events. Everquest is a game where he with the best toys wins. Thus the powergamers will always, <b>always</b> seek out and destroy anyone involved in a GM event. You can look at them and go &#8220;Tsk! Tsk! Shame on you for not staying in character and bowing before the Goddess Tunare!&#8221; but those powergamers have pretty much made a career out of Everquest (a pretty lucrative one, judging from eBay listings) and they really don&#8217;t give a fuck what you think about their style of play. Don&#8217;t want powergamers to nuke everything that moves everytime a God shows up? Don&#8217;t drop k3wl toys when they die. Simple learned response. Probably too late to change now, though, and Everquest will retain its status as a game with an excellent backstory that absolutely no one outside of Verant cares about.<br><br>Now, you&#8217;d think Ultima Online would know better. UO has had an Interest section for years now. Granted, not the most active part of the support team, but one that Origin has committed to plowing time and resources in. The BNN reports are pretty funny even if they do keep getting my name wrong. Everyone loves the new town invasions. The very concept of Lord British being 0wned by a tribe of mongbats is too cool for words.<br><br>There&#8217;s just one problem &#8211; you can&#8217;t win. The story has been pre-ordained. Set in stone. Well, maybe not stone, but in nice neat silvery &#8220;Ultima Online: Renaissance&#8221; boxes. There is nothing you can do about it. No amount of personal bravery, no amount of sacrifice, no amount of slaughtered liches in the streets will change the script that has already been written in Austin.<br><br>Now, granted it&#8217;s a good <b>start</b> that the world of UO is actually changing once in a while, but the whole point of Ultima Online is its dynamic nature. That strength is subverted by the work of a bunch of presumably well-meaning folks who have decided they know what will entertain you. I mean, it works for television, right? You get to appear in their story. You don&#8217;t get to do anything that has any meaning, mind you, but you can die. <br><br>And you can die frequently. We&#8217;ve been getting reports of GM kills that rival the worst of EQ.  IGM/Seer run characters that spawn 50 hell hounds at once, causing everyone on screen to lag out and be slaughtered. Effectively invulnerable &#8220;main plot&#8221; characters that wordlessly cut down anyone who tries to fight them, and teleport away if by some insane reach of combat they actually lose 10% or so of their 36,737 hit points. <br><br>This is not fun, folks. Well, maybe it is for the GMs who get to whoop up on the players. But they don&#8217;t pay for the privilege. <b>We do</b>. <br><br>Of all the ORPGs out, UO has the potential for the most, for lack of a better word, adult plot realizations. It&#8217;s a good sign when Origin signals that they are willing to inconvienence some players by letting cities fall. The next step is to let the players drive the direction of the plot. It&#8217;s a necessary step. Otherwise,  Origin is the immature dungeon master we all remember who gets an ego trip up and running and decides the game has become &#8220;how best can I kill off the players&#8221;. <br><br>That is not what it&#8217;s about. For god&#8217;s sake, if Origin won&#8217;t, maybe Turbine or Wolfpack or god forbid even Verant should <b>hire some goddamned professional writers and game designers</b>.  The writers to create a plot that can be compelling and on a scale that makes sense both for the community leaders and the third spearman from the left in the Cove defense perimeter. And the game designers to teach the writers how to write decision trees, and to implement them so that the story doesn&#8217;t totally collapse if some bright player figures out &#8220;Hey! What if we do this&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>It&#8217;s basic Game Mastering 101, folks. You allow for the players to drive the story. You roll with the punches. You change the plot in response to their actions. And <b>you don&#8217;t kill all the players</b>.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000110.html">The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers</a></b> <br><br><br>

I haven't visited the <a href="http://www.uo2.com/main.html">Official UO2 website</a> that much. Frankly, there hasn't been that much to see lately. Plus, I wanted to re-read all my old Micronauts comic books - y'know; to get me into the proper frame of mind. Starr Long, the guy who, according to legends, was the one who walked up to Richard Garriott on "Donut and Coffee Friday" and said <i><font color="#77FF77">"You know what would be totally awesome? Dude, if like we made an Ultima game, but instead of like it being something you pay for at the store, we charge them a fee every month to keep playing it. Dude, that would be so radical. Are you gonna finish that donut?"</font></i> Okay, so maybe it wasn't <i>exactly</i> like that - but you get the idea. So Starr Long has the job of returning to the well for more water, this time calling it "Ultima Online 2". There are no clever secondary titles yet, but I keep thinking it will be something like, <i>"Blackthorne is back, and he's here to kick a little <b>bot</b>."</i><br><br><a href="http://www.uo2.com/comments_3.html">So I found a letter from Starr Long on the UO2 website</a>, and he went into detail regarding a few of the more "totally radical" features we might see in UO2. I'll interpret each paragraph for you, in the event that you don't want to read and interpret yourself. Makes me feel like a journalist that way. Ladies and Gentleman, I give you Starr Long:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">"Unique Characters: Of course, this includes carrying on the fine tradition that UO set of having your character look truly unique. <b>Combinations of armor, clothing, weapons, skin color, hairstyle, etc. will give you that ability to shape your look. The addition of two new player races will offer even more in this department.</b> However, uniqueness doesn't just include look, it also includes your character's abilities and activities. Expect to be able to select from a variety of skills ranging from sword fighting to blacksmithing to alchemy that will allow you to create a unique set of abilities for your character."</font><br><b><i>Translation: Eye Candy.</i></b><br><br><font color="#77FF77">"New Setting: When we sat down to do this, we wanted to offer you different experiences in fiction, visuals, and gameplay. One way for us to do that was to introduce elements beyond medieval fantasy. Think of this as an expansion of the Ultima world, not a replacement of it. A huge section of the world is the Ultima you know and love. The cities of Britain, Yew, and Vesper are still around and are very 'medieval fantasy' in tone and setting. Our writer, Aaron De Orive, has been hard at work crafting a captivating story, which will blend the genre of the traditional Ultima with the creative expansions we are doing in Ultima Online 2. We have just released the first installment of a series of stories that will explain how the setting came to be. We felt this would be a better way to pull you into the story, rather than just put up a plot outline. <b>In addition to our intensive work on the story, we have partnered with Todd McFarlane to work with our own art director, Andy Hoyos, to visualize the expanded world of Ultima. A natural extension of our partnership with McFarlane was to have him create action figures of the characters he was creating with us."</b></font><br><b><i>Translation: Some gameplay, oh and Some More Eye Candy.</i></b><br><br><font color="#77FF77">"Adventure: Adventuring is one of the most exciting aspects of these kinds of games and we have spent a lot of our time making sure we have the most compelling combat around. <b>Hundreds of motion-captured moves, including unarmed, swordplay, magic casting, deathblows, etc. make the combat really come alive. No longer will it just be watching the same repeated sword slash over and over and over.</b> In addition, we are working with some of the finest minds in artificial intelligence right now to make sure our creatures are a real challenge and not just obstacles. In fact, one of them is presenting a paper at this year's Game Developer's Conference about his work in this field on games like Dungeon Keeper 2."</font><br><b><i>Translation: The AI you should have gotten in UO, oh and some More Eye Candy.</i></b><br><br>Correct me if I am wrong about this, but isn't the #1 complaint about this industry from it's consumers that developers have abandoned format, content, and gameplay in exchange for glitz, glitz, and super-enhanced surround-sound Dolby enhanced THX certified, .001 dot pitch resolutioned -GLITZ-?<br><br>I'm not a complete moron. I should have my Associate Moron Degree by the end of the spring semester. I'm <i>certain</i> there will be a measure of content, format, and gameplay in Ultima Online 2. The concern I have is that at a time when you want to create consumer "chatter" about a product, do you promote the secondary features, or do you try to push the best that your product has to offer? The answer is simple - you promote the best that your product has to offer. I'm concerned because Starr Long seems to think that the best Ultima Online 2 has to offer is More Eye Candy, More Eye Candy, and More Eye Candy.<br><br>To that, I can express my concerns in only three words:<br><b><center> Ultima Nine: Ascension</center></b><br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000105.html">"Don't let the Starrs get in your eyes."</a><br><br>

It&#8217;s a very dim recollection for me, and I don&#8217;t remember exactly when it ended and what the explanation for its discontinuation was.  Would &#8220;our staff are too busy to continually update the message&#8221; be more important than keeping the players updated?  And what&#8217;s the connection between this and the people that put &#8220;OSI fukin&#8217; SuX&#8221; in their bank macros?  Let&#8217;s see.<br><br>I watched someone perform an elaborate scam with a &#8220;tower scroll&#8221; at the Britain bank this evening.  He swore the &#8220;new patch&#8221; enabled people to <i>carry around</i> a scroll representing placed buildings, and told people that they just weren&#8217;t up-to-date enough if they hadn&#8217;t heard about it.  Ignoring my &#8220;don&#8217;t do it!  you&#8217;ll be sorry!  don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t tell you so!&#8221; warnings, the victim put in his 100k or whatever in the trade window with the "tower scroll," and found himself with nothing after clicking his diamond.  But how was he to know that that this &#8220;tower scroll&#8221; wasn&#8217;t the way &#8220;secure house trading&#8221; works, as of last week&#8217;s update?  The victim didn&#8217;t feel so betrayed by the scammer, but instead by Origin -- &#8220;fucking osi and their stupid patches.&#8221;  (We could also argue about how stupid somebody is for believing anybody would sell a tower for so little when he or she could get $800 for it on <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a>, but that&#8217;s not the point.)<br><br>What with the recent <a href="http://update.uo.com">New Idea a Day</a> phase the dev team is going through and the <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cgi/cob/devboard.cgi?view">ensuing outrages</a>, it&#8217;s more important than ever that the entire playerbase keep updated on changes.  Any amount of time spent at a high-traffic area in-game will prove to you that the majority of players are ignorant about what&#8217;s going on (the house scamming above is indicative of the phenomenon).  Visiting a web site for the news is too much work; most people now would rather wait for a patch and then ICQ their friends to ask about it.  Were players more educated back when the Auto-Patch message told them about it?  I&#8217;d assume they were.<br><br>Most people probably just click through the Auto-Patch message as quickly as possible, and probably wouldn&#8217;t even notice if it was changed.  But if a patch went in, and they knew the message would tell them what was in it, I&#8217;d imagine they&#8217;d read it the next time they loaded up the client.  It would be even better if there was some way to access the information from within the game without loading a web browser, some kind of extention of the &#8220;Help&#8221; window that itemized everything included in the last update, but that&#8217;s probably not something we can hope for.  Updating the Auto-Patch message with a summary of the changes is realistic, though -- it&#8217;s easy and accessible for everyone to see, and it doesn&#8217;t require visiting an external resource.<br><br>When the playerbase is forcefully kept up-to-date on changes in the game, they&#8217;ll not only be protected in whatever small way from scams taking advantage of their ignorance, but they&#8217;ll feel closer to Origin.  <b>This is the point</b> -- the players will feel like they&#8217;re active, rather than sitting back and letting things happen to them by an unknown force; they&#8217;ll feel like Origin is going out of its way to reach out for them, freely giving them information, rather than tweaking things behind their backs.  It might help stop some of the blind &#8220;I hate OSI&#8221; sentiments so many people adhere to.

The lead GMs would take control of him, and put on a little skit for the people in the zone, having something to do with a new quest. At least, that's how it went on the other servers...<br><br>On the server I play on however, (E'ci) things didn't quite go so smoothly. Our lead GM (Sal`varae) took it upon herself to go on a little killing spree, insta-killing anyone she wanted while invulnerable.<br><br>I was one of the few people in the zone when Mayong first appeared, and as a paladin I figured this would be a good chance to roleplay.  I spouted some crap like "Die, fiend" or something to that effect, and started attacking.  Your target is invulnerable, yadda yadda yadda.  BAM, You have been slain by Mayong Mistmoore.  First of all, this basically sends a message to the players, "Don't bother even trying to roleplay, we won't allow it."<br><br>Anyway, I finally get back to my corpse and loot up.  By this time there are a good 80 people in the zone crowding around Mayong and his cohorts, some attacking him, some just watching.  I decided to watch this time. Mayong immediately insta-killed anyone that attacked him, fine.  Fair enough.  Then after about 10-15 minutes of this, he starts going after anyone and everyone in his sight.  Keep in mind this is a GM doing this, killing people for no good reason.  The second time I was insta-killed I was meditating in a corner, hardly anything threatening. <br><br>This is when I got angry.  I petitioned about this shocking abuse of<br>authority, and was told by a Guide or GM or some person that they would make a note of it.  Later that night, I get a tell from Sal`varae, out of the blue, saying that my name, Ahura Mazda, is unacceptable.  I tell her I've had this name for nearly 10 months now, it was given to me by her predecessor, the lead GM at the time.  Doesn't matter, she thinks it's inappropriate.  When I pressed her to find out WHY it was inappropriate, she threatens to give me an "official GM warning" whatever the hell that is.  So I shut up and kindly petition again about this latest abuse of power.  Another note is supposedly made. <br><br>Now am I the only one that finds this horribly wrong?  <br><br>Jason Drushel, who until recently went by Ahura Mazda</font><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000106.html">Now what, I ask, is wrong with naming yourself after figures of Zoroastrian faith?</a></b><br><br>

HONEST!</b></font><br><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><i>Friday, February 25, 2000 - 6:31 PM</i> [Filed by <a href="lum@xrgaming.net">lum</a>]</i></td></tr></table><br><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="http://www.uo2.com/">The UO2 site</a> was redesigned. Also, they are promising actual content which may be updated at some point in the future. As part of that, we now have just tons and tons of new info about UO2, some of which sounds almost as plausible as Blackthorn leading the <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/uo2.html">Great Sosarian Cultural Revolution</a>. <br><br>From the FAQ: <font color="#77FF77"><b> In what time frame is the fiction for Ultima Online 2 set?</b><br><br>Ultima Online 2 is set approximately 200 years after a Great Cataclysm has ripped through the world of Ultima Online. Ultima Online is set in a divergent timeline, adrift from the timeline of the standalone Ultima games, diverging at the shattering of the gem of immortality at the end of Ultima 1. The events of Ultima Online are occurring at the same time that Ultima 4 and Ultima 5 were happening in the Primary Thread. <br><br>This means that the events of Ultima 2 through 9 have never happened in UO's Britannia, although people from Ultimas 2 through 9 (Blackthorn, Minax, Dupre, etc) are affecting the course of UO's history, albeit in different ways from the standalone games. For example, Lord Blackthorn was never corrupted by the Shadowlords, and thus has a friendly, yet adversarial, relationship with British in Ultima Online. <br><br><b>Does Ultima Online 2 happen in Britannia?</b><br><br>Yes. But a lot can change in 200 years. </font><br><br>Including, obviously, the invention of the <a href="http://www.uo2.com/images/juggernaut.jpg">Borg</a>. Speaking of the Borg, the friendly Origin folks are quite willing to <a href="http://www.uo2.com/downloads.html">assimilate</a> your website graphics. I now look forward to thousands of guild websites with the same cheesy lizardskin backdrop.<br><br>Also, UO2 is jumping head first into the Jargon Wars, calling their product a <b>Persistent State World</b>. I guess the snickering when the words "Roleplaying Game" were mentioned got to be too much.<br><br><font color="#77FF77"><b>What is a Persistent State World?</b><br><br>Also referred to as a PSW, a Persistent State World is a virtual Internet world that you co-inhabit with thousands of other people simultaneously. It&#8217;s persistent in that the world exists independent of your presence, and in that your actions can permanently shape the world. The fact that you are existing with other real people from around the globe adds a level of immersion that must be experienced to be believed. </font><br><br>And of course, there's all the new <a href="http://www.uo2.com/fiction_0.html">Ultima fan fiction</a> for you to read.
