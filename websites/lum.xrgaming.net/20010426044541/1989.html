<p align="left"><font face="Arial">It was a bright cold day in April, and the
clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Druid, his chin nuzzled into his breast
in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of
Rivervale Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust
from entering along with him. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old
tobacco plants. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor
display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more
than a metre wide: the face of a man of about thirty-five, with a moustache and
beard, holding a flaming sword. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use
trying to cast gate. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at
present mana regeneration was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the
economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven zones up, and
Winston, who was 39th level and had a very low agility, went slowly, resting
several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster
with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which
are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. THE GUIDES ARE
WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading
out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of Tumpy
Tonics. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which
formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and
the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The
instrument (the /AUC channel, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no
way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish,
frail figure with hairy feet, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by
the leather armor which was the uniform of his class. His hair was very fair,
his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor
blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Outside, even through the shut window-pane,
the world looked cold. Down in the street the rain fell and fell and never
ceased falling, and there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters
that were plastered everywhere. The brown moustachio'd face gazed down from
every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite.
BRAD KNOWS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked
deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner,
flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single
word VISION. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs,
hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving
flight. It was the Guides, snooping into people's windows. The Guides did not
matter, however. Only the GMs mattered.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Behind Winston's back the voice from the chat
channel was still babbling away about Tumpy Tonics and the futility of
performing quests for experience gain. The chat channel received and transmitted
simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low
whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the
field of vision which the game client commanded, he could be seen as well as
heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at
any given moment. How often, or on what system, the GMs plugged in on any
individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched
everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever
they wanted to. You had to live -- did live, from habit that became instinct --
in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in
darkness, every movement scrutinized.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Winston typed /AUC OFF. It was safer, though,
as he well knew, even silence can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of
Online Community Relations, his place of work, towered vast and white above the
grimy landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste -- this was
Rivervale, chief city of Misty Thicket, itself the third most populous of the
provinces of Everquest. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that
should tell him whether Rivervale had always been quite like this. Were there
always these vistas of rotting thirteenth-century houses, their sides shored up
with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with
corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? And the
oompah music playing, mockingly, from every street corner? But it was no use, he
could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of
bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Ministry of OCR was startlingly different
from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of
glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into
the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on
its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Game: GROUPING IS
NECESSARY STATS ARE USEFUL IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH The Ministry of OCR contained,
it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding
ramifications below. Scattered about Rivervale there were just three other
buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the
surrounding architecture that from the roof of Rivervale Mansions you could see
all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four Ministries
between which the entire apparatus of government was divided. The Ministry of
OCR, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, and education. The
Ministry of Nerfs, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Support,
which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Trade Skills, which was
responsible for economic affairs. (This last ministry was somewhat decrepit from
neglect.)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Ministry of Support was the really
frightening one. There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been
inside the Ministry of Support, nor within half a kilometre of it. It was a
place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by
penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and
/petition queues. Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed
by gorilla-faced guards in odd-colored robes, armed with sparking swords.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">-=-</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the
Message Base Liason Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the
chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite
the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just
taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by
sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was
a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he
knew that she worked in the Quests&nbsp; Department. Presumably -- since he had
sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner she had some
mechanical job on one of the quest-writing machines. She was a bold-looking
girl, of about twenty- seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift,
athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Druid
League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly
enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from
the very first moment of seeing her. He disliked nearly all women, and
especially the young and pretty ones. It was always the women, and above all the
young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Classes, the swallowers
of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular
girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when they
passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to
pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The
idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the GMs. That, it
was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness,
which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere
near him. He vowed never to give her a SoW.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The other person was a man named Abashi, a
member of the Inner Circle and holder of some post so important and remote that
Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the
group of people round the chairs as they saw the black jackbooted uniform of an
Inner Circle member approaching. Abashi was a large, burly man with a thick neck
and a coarse, humorous, brutal face.Winston had seen Abashi perhaps a dozen
times in almost as many years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely
because he was intrigued by the contrast between Abashi's urbane manner and his
prize-fighter's physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief --
or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope -- that Abashi's political orthodoxy
was not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again,
perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply
intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you
could talk to if somehow you could cheat the message boards and get him alone.
Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there
was no way of doing so. At this moment Abashi glanced at his wrist-watch, saw
that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Message
Base Liason Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over. He took a chair in
the same row as Winston, a couple of places away. A small, sandy-haired woman
who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The girl with dark
hair was sitting immediately behind.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The next moment a hideous, grinding speech,
as of some monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen
at the end of the room. It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled
the hair at the back of one's neck. The Hate had started.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">As usual, the face of Dr. TwisTer, the Enemy
of the People, had flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there
among the audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear
and disgust. TwisTer was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how
long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the
community. Then he had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been
condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes
of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which
TwisTer was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor, the earliest
defiler of the Vision's purity. All subsequent crimes against the Vision, all
treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his
teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies:
perhaps somewhere beyond the pale, under the protection of his corporate
paymasters, perhaps even -- so it was occasionally rumoured -- in some
hiding-place in Everquest itself.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could
never see the face of TwisTer without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a
clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile
silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was
perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like
quality. TwisTer was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of
the Vision -- an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have
been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an
alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be
taken in by it. He was abusing Brad, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the
Vision, he was demanding an immediate merger with Ultima Online, he was crying
hysterically that the Vision had been betrayed, he was demanding that all
outstanding exploits be legalized. And all the while, lest one should be in any
doubt as to the reality which TwisTer's specious claptrap covered, behind his
head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of an army of Ultima
Online PKs -- row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Britannian
faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by
others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed
the background to TwisTer's bleating voice.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty
seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the
people in the room. The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the
terrifying power of the PK army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides,
the sight or even the thought of TwisTer produced fear and anger automatically.
He was an object of hatred more constant than either Ultima Online or Asheron's
Call, since when Everquest was at war with one of these it was generally at
peace with the other. But what was strange was that although TwisTer was hated
and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on
platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were
refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish
that they were in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less.
Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be announced by him. A day never passed
when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the
GMs. He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of
conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the Game. The Network, its name was
supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible program, a
compendium of all the heresies, of which TwisTer was the author and which
circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a program without a title.
People referred to it, if at all, simply as <i>the program.</i> But one knew of
such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Network nor <i>the program</i>
was a subject that any ordinary Class member would mention if there was a way of
avoiding it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In its second minute the Hate rose to a
frenzy. People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops
of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came
from the screen. The little sandy- haired woman had turned bright pink, and her
mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even Abashi's heavy
face was flushed. He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest
swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave.
The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!'
and suddenly she picked up a Ruins of Kunark CD and flung it at the screen. It
struck TwisTer's nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. In a
lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his
heel violently against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about the Two
Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary,
that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence
was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire
to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow
through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even
against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that
one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one
object to another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's
hatred was not turned against TwisTer at all, but, on the contrary, against Brad,
the Vision, and the GMs; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely,
derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of
lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and
all that was said of TwisTer seemed to him to be true. At those moments his
secret loathing of Brad changed into adoration, and Brad seemed to tower up, an
invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of
Ultima Online, and TwisTer, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the
doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter,
capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of
civilization.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of
TwisTer had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed
into that of a sheep. Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a PK who
seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his energy bolts roaring, and seeming
to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the
front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But in the same moment,
drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the
face of Brad, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost
filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Brad was saying. It was merely a few
words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle,
not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being
spoken. Then the face of Brad faded away again, and instead the three slogans of
the Vision stood out in bold capitals: GROUPING IS NECESSARY STATS ARE USEFUL
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH But the face of Brad seemed to persist for several seconds
on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was
too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandyhaired woman had flung
herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous
murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended her arms towards the screen.
Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent that she was uttering a
prayer.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">At this moment the entire group of people
broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of 'Brad! . . . Brad!' -- over and
over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'Brad' and the
second-a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of
which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.
For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was
often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to
the wisdom and majesty of Brad, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a
deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise. Winston's
entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing
in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of 'Brad! . . . Brad!'
always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the rest: it was
impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to
do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a
space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might
conceivably have betrayed him. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">And it was exactly at this moment that the
significant thing happened -- if, indeed, it did happen. Momentarily he caught
Abashi's eye. Abashi had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles and was in
the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. But
there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took
to happen Winston knew-yes, he <i>knew</i> !-that Abashi was thinking the same
thing as himself. An unmistakable message had passed. It was as though their two
minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through
their eyes. 'I am with you,' Abashi seemed to be saying to him. 'I know
precisely what you are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred,
your disgust. But don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of
intelligence was gone, and Abashi's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">-=-</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A trumpet call floated from the telescreen
just above their heads. However, it was not the proclamation of a military
victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry of Nerfs. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice.
'Attention, comrades! We have glorious news! Our glorious Classes are being
enhanced! Returns now completed of the output of all Classes show that the
average damage output of each Class has risen by no less than 20 per cent over
the past year. All over Everquest this morning there were irrepressible
spontaneous demonstrations when Necromancers marched out of dungeons and swamps
and paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Brad for
the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us. Here are
some of the completed figures. Two-handed swords-' </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred
several times. It had been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Nerfs.
Parsons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of
gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures,
but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction.&nbsp; For
the moment Winston had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to
the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had even
been demonstrations to thank Brad for raising the effectiveness of Clarity by
twenty percent. And only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that
Clarity was to be <i>reduced</i> by twenty percent. Was it possible that they
could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it.
Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless
creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a
furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest
that last week Clarity had been somehow better than it was today. Syme, too-in
some more complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, <i>alone</i>
in the possession of a memory? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The fabulous statistics continued to pour out
of the telescreen. As compared with last year there was more creature spawns,
more unique items, more spells, more fun -- more of everything except camping,
crime, and boredom. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything
was whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his
spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across the
table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated resentfully
on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like this? Had food always
tasted like this? He looked round the canteen. A low-ceilinged, crowded room,
its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables
and chairs, placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent
spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every
crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad Tumpy Tonics and bad coffee and
metallic stew and dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there
was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you
had a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly
different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been
quite enough to eat, one had never had armor that was not full of holes,
spellcastng had always been battered and rickety -- nothing cheap and plentiful
except Tumpy Tonics. And though, of course, it grew worse as one's body aged,
was it not a sign that this was <i>not</i> the natural order of things, if one's
heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable zone
crawls, the slowness of one's sword, the spells that were always resisted, the
Cooking resuls with its strange evil tastes? Why should one feel it to be
intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once
been different? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">He looked round the canteen again. Nearly
everyone was ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than
in the uniform leather armor. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table
alone, a small, curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his
little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was,
thought Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical
type set up by the Vision as an ideal- tall muscular barbarians and deep-bosomed
wood elves, vital, sunburnt, carefree -- existed and even predominated.
Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people in Rivervale were
small, hairy, and ill-favoured. It was curious how that beetle-like type
proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing stout very early in
life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable faces with
very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion
of the Vision. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The announcement from the Ministry of Nerfs
ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">-=-</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">They had done it, they had done it at last! </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The room they were standing in was
long-shaped and softly lit. The chat channel was turned to a low murmur; the
richness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet.
At the far end of the room Abashi was sitting at a table under a green-shaded
lamp, with a mass of papers on either side of him. He had not bothered to look
up when the servant showed Julia and Winston in.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Winston's heart was thumping so hard that he
doubted whether he would be able to speak. They had done it, they had done it at
last, was all he could think. It had been a rash act to come here at all, and
sheer folly to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by
different routes and only met on Abashi's doorstep. But merely to walk into such
a place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on very rare occasions that
one saw inside the dwelling-places of the Inner Circle, or even penetrated into
the quarter of the town where they lived. The whole atmosphere of the huge block
of flats, the richness and spaciousness of everything, the unfamiliar smells of
good food and good tobacco, the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and
down, the white-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro -- everything was
intimidating. Although he had a good pretext for coming here, he was haunted at
every step by the fear that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from
round the corner, demand his papers, and order him to get out. Abashi's servant,
however, had admitted the two of them without demur. He was a small, dark-haired
man in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless face
which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage down which he led them was
softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white wainscoting, all exquisitely
clean. That too was intimidating. Winston could not remember ever to have seen a
passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Abashi had a slip of paper between his
fingers and seemed to be studying it intently. His heavy face, bent down so that
one could see the line of the nose, looked both formidable and intelligent. For
perhaps twenty seconds he sat without stirring. Then he pulled the keyboard
towards him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Vision:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'<b>The /corpse ability (dragging) is
relatively new to EverQuest, and was put in to help people get their corpses out
of inaccessible areas without having to wait for a GM/Guide. At this point, it
works well for that use and we decline to invest further time into it.</b> <b>Stating
it as plainly as possible, we consider the issue closed.</b>'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">He rose deliberately from his chair and came
towards them across the soundless carpet. His expression was grimmer than usual,
as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror that Winston
already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment. It
seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake. For what
evidence had he in reality that Abashi was any kind of political conspirator?
Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark: beyond that, only
his own secret imaginings, founded on a dream. He could not even fall back on
the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary, because in that case
Julia's presence was impossible to explain. As Abashi passed the screen with the
chat channels displayed, a thought seemed to strike him. He stopped, turned
aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap. The channels had
stopped.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak
of surprise. Even in the midst of his panic, Winston was too much taken aback to
be able to hold his tongue.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You can turn them off!' he said.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Yes,' said Abashi, 'we can turn them off. We
have that privilege.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">He was opposite them now. His solid form
towered over the pair of them, and the expression on his face was still
indecipherable. He was waiting, somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but
about what? Even now it was quite conceivabIe that he was simply a busy man
wondering irritably why he had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the
stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched
past, enormous. With difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on
Abashi's. Then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the
beginnings of a smile. With his characteristic gesture Abashi resettled his
spectacles on his nose.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'I will say it,' said Winston promptly. 'That
thing is really turned off?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Yes, everything is turned off. We are
alone.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'We have come here because-'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">He paused, realizing for the first time the
vagueness of his own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind of help he
expected from Abashi, it was not easy to say why he had come here. He went on,
conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'We believe that there is some kind of
conspiracy, some kind of secret organization working against the Vision, and
that you are involved in it. We want to join it and work for it. We are enemies
of the Vision. We disbelieve in the principles of class balance. We are
exploiters. We have also engaged in cybersex. I tell you this because we want to
put ourselves at your mercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any
other way, we are ready.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">He stopped and glanced over his shoulder,
with the feeling that the door had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced
servant had come in without knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray
with a decanter and glasses.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Zatkin is one of us,' said Abashi
impassively. 'Bring the drinks over here, Geoff. Put them on the round table.
Have we enough chairs? Then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. Bring a
chair for yourself, Geoff. This is business. You can stop being a servant for
the next ten minutes.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The little man sat down, quite at his ease,
and yet still with a servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege.
Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man's
whole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his
assumed personality even for a moment. Abashi took the decanter by the neck and
filled up the glasses with a dark- red liquid. It aroused in Winston dim
memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding -- a vast bottle
composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its
contents into a glass. Seen from the top the stuff looked almost black, but in
the decanter it gleamed like a ruby. It had a sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia
pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'It is called wine,' said Abashi with a faint
smile. 'You will have read about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets to
the player base, I am afraid.' His face grew solemn again, and he raised his
glass: 'I think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. To our
Leader: To Dr. TwisTer'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Then there is such a person as TwisTer?' he
said.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Yes, there is such a person, and he is
alive. Where, I do not know.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'And the conspiracy -- the organization? Is
it real? It is not simply an invention of the GMs?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'No, it is real. The Network, we call it. You
will never learn much more about the Network than that it exists and that it
provides you with 10MB of web storage space. I will come back to that
presently.' He looked at his wrist-watch. 'It is unwise even for members of the
Inner Circle to turn off ICQ for more than half an hour. You ought not to have
come here together, and you will have to leave separately. You, comrade' -- he
bowed his head to Julia -- 'will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at
our disposal. You will understand that I must start by asking you certain
questions. In general terms, what are you prepared to do?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Anything that we are capable of,' said
Winston. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Abashi had turned himself a little in his
chair so that he was facing Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take it
for granted that Winston could speak for her. For a moment the lids flitted down
over his eyes. He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as
though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers were
known to him already. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You are prepared to die and not ask for an
XP res?' 'Yes.' </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You are prepared to PK?' 'Yes.' </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'To commit acts of sabotage which may cause
the loss of connection of hundreds of innocent people?' 'Yes.' </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'To betray the game to other companies?'
'Yes.' </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You are prepared to cheat, to dupe, to
blackmail, to corrupt the minds of children, to distribute habit-forming
programs, to encourage prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases -- to do
anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the
Vision?' 'Yes.' 'If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to become
a gnome warrior -- are you prepared to do that?' 'Yes.' </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You are prepared to lose your identity and
live out the rest of your life as a human rogue?' 'Yes.' </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You are prepared to log out, if and when we
order you to do so?' 'Yes.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Good. Then that is settled.' There was a
silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a rather absent-minded air Abashi
pushed them towards the others, took one himself, then stood up and began to
pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think better standing. They were very
good cigarettes, very thick and well-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in the
paper. Abashi looked at his wrist-watch again.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'That will do for the moment. Later we will
arrange something else for you. It is important to change one's hiding-place
frequently. Meanwhile I shall send you a copy of <i>the program'</i> -- even
Abashi, Winston noticed, seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in
italics- 'as soon as possible. It may be some days before I can get hold of one.
There are not many in existence, as you can imagine. The GMs hunt them down and
destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them. It makes very little
difference. The program is open source. If the last copy were gone, we could recode
it almost byte for byte. Do you carry a brief-case to work with you?' he added.
'As a rule, yes.' 'What is it like?' 'Black, very shabby. With two straps.'
'Black, two straps, very shabby -- good. One day in the fairly near future-I
cannot give a date -- one of the messages among your morning's work will contain
a misprinted word, and you will have to ask for a repeat. On the following day
you will go to work without your brief-case. At some time during the day, in the
street, a man will touch you on the arm and say &quot;I think you have dropped
your brief-case.&quot; The one he gives you will contain a copy of the program.
You will return it within fourteen days.' They were silent for a moment.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">-=-</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his
joints he climbed the stair above Mr Charrington's shop. He was tired, but not
sleepy any longer. He opened the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put
on a pan of water for coffee. Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was <i>the
program.</i> He sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the
brief-case. A gold CD with the word &quot;ShowEQ&quot; scrawled on it. Winston
inserted the CD into his computer and doubleclicked on the
&quot;README.TXT&quot; file icon that appeared. The first words of the file
were:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF <br>
MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER ONLINE ROLE PLAYING GAME DESIGN </b><i><br>
by</i> <i><br>
Dr. Nathaniel L. Twister, Ph. D.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Winston began reading. Without having even
run <i>the program,</i> he knew what TwisTer's final message must mean. The
future belonged to the players. And could he be sure that when their time came
the world they constructed would not be just as alien to him, Winston Druid, as
the world of the Vision? Yes, because at the least it would be a world of
sanity. Where there is equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would
happen, strength would change into consciousness. The playerss were immortal,
you could not doubt it. In the end their awakening would come. And until that
happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all
the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Vision
did not share and could not kill.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Do you remember,' Winston said, 'the bixie
that sang to us, that first day, at the edge of the wood?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'He wasn't singing to us,' said Julia. 'He
was singing to please himself. Not even that. He was just singing.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The bixies sang, the orcs sang. the Vision
did not sing. All round the world, in Rivervale and Freeport, in Ak'Anon and
Kaladim, and in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the
streets of Qeynos and Halas, in the villages of the endless Karana plain, in the
woodlands of Faydark and Kithicor -- everywhere stood the same solid
unconquerable figure, made monstrous by work and childbearing, toiling from
birth to death and still singing. Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious
beings must one day come. You were the dead, theirs was the future. But you
could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the
body, and passed on the secret doctrine that armor class is the only statistic
that matters.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'We have been banned,' he said.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'We have been banned,' echoed Julia
dutifully.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You have been banned,' said an iron voice
behind them.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">They sprang apart. Winston's entrails seemed
to have turned into ice. He could see the white all round the irises of Julia's
eyes. Her face had turned a milky yellow. The smear of rouge that was still on
each cheekbone stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin
beneath.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You have been banned,' repeated the iron
voice. 'Remain exactly where you are. Make no movement until you are ordered.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">It was starting, it was starting at last!
They could do nothing except stand gazing into one another's eyes. To cast an
evac, to log out before it was too late -- no such thought occurred to them.
Unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall. 'Stand out in the middle of
the room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands behind your heads. Do not touch
one another.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Mr Charrington came into the room. He gave
Winston a single sharp glance, as though verifying his identity, and then paid
no more attention to him. It occurred to Winston that for the first time in his
life he was looking, with knowledge, at a GM..</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">-=-</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A long time passed. If it had been midnight
when the skull-faced man was taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was
afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting
on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved
by the unseen GMs. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The boots were approaching again. The door
opened. Abashi came in.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Winston started to his feet. The shock of the
sight had driven all caution out of him. 'They've got you too!' he cried.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'They got me a long time ago,' said Abashi
with a mild, almost regretful irony. He stepped aside, from behind him there
emerged a broad-chested guide with a long black truncheon in his hand.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You knew all along, Winston,' said Abashi.
'Don't deceive yourself. You did know it -- you have always known it.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">-=-</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">He did not remember any ending to his
interrogation. There was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room, in
which he now was had gradually materialized round him. He was almost flat on his
back, and unable to move. His body was held down at every essential point. Even
the back of his head was gripped in some manner. Abashi was looking down at him
gravely and rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn,
with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older than
Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under his hand
there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round the face.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Without any warning except a slight movement
of Abashi's hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. It was a frightening pain,
because he could not see what was happening, and he had the feeling that some
mortal injury was being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was
really happening, or whether the effect was electrically produced ; but his body
was being wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart.
Although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all
was the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and breathed
hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible. Abashi drew
back the lever on the dial. The wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it had
come.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'That was four,' said Abashi. 'You can see
that the numbers on this dial go to eleven. Will you please remember, throughout
our conversation, that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any
moment and to whatever degree I choose? If you in any way complain about your
Class being unbalanced, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you understand
that?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Yes,' said Winston.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'I am taking trouble with you, Winston,' he
said, 'because you are worth trouble. You know perfectly well what is the matter
with you. You have known it for years, though you have fought against the
knowledge. You are mentally deranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You
are unable to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember
other events which never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have never
cured yourself of it, because you did not choose to. There was a small effort of
the will that you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware, you are
clinging to your disease under the impression that it is a virtue. Now we will
take an example. At this moment, which Class is the most powerful?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'When I was arrested, Enchanters were the
most powerful class.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">.'Enchanters. Good. And Enchanters have
always been exactly that powerful, have they not?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Winston drew in his breath. He opened his
mouth to speak and then did not speak. He could not take his eyes away from the
dial.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'The truth, please, Winston. <i>Your</i>
truth. Tell me what you think you remember.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'I remember that the Whirl Till You Hurl
spell used to actually be useful in combat. Before that -- '</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Abashi stopped him with a movement of the
hand. More than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but
promising child.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'There is a Vision slogan dealing with class
balance,' he said. 'Repeat it, if you please.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'All classes are equally balanced and all
classes are useful and desired in groups', repeated Winston obediently.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'All classes are equally balanced and all
classes are useful and desired in groups', said Abashi, nodding his head with
approval. 'Is it your opinion, Winston, that all classes are equally balanced?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Again the feeling of helplessness descended
upon Winston. His eyes flitted towards the dial. He not only did not know
whether 'yes' or 'no' was the answer that would save him from pain; he did not
even know which answer he believed to be the true one.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">O'Brien addressed Winston, his back turned to
him.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'What effect does Dexterity have on combat,
Winston?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'It controls how often your weapons proc.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'And if the Vision says that you are not to
know this, that Dexterity has other uses in combat, do you still believe what
you say?''</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Yes'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle
of the dial had shot up to nine. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston's
body. The air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by
clenching his teeth he could not stop. Abashi watched him intently. He drew back
the lever. This time the pain was only slightly eased.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Do you still believe, Winston?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Yes.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The needle went up to ten.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Is that your FINAL ANSWER?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'YES! YES! What else can I say! Everyone
knows Dex is useless in Everquest! Stop! Please!'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The needle shot to eleven, and stayed there.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Do you still believe Dexterity is useless,
Winston?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'NO! NO! Stop the pain, please! How can you
do this! Stop! Stop!'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying.
You still think the Vision is wrong. Your answer, please?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Yes! No! Yes! No! Anything you want! What do
you want! Only stop the pain! Please!'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Abruptly he was sitting up with Abashi's arm
round his shoulders. He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. The
bonds that had held his body down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was
shaking uncontrollably, his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down
his cheeks. For a moment he clung to Abashi like a baby, curiously comforted by
the heavy arm round his shoulders. He had the feeling that Abashi was his
protector, that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other
source, and that it was Abashi who would save him from it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'You are a slow learner, Winston,' said
Abashi gently.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'How can I help it?' he blubbered. 'How can I
help seeing what is in front of my eyes? Dexterity is only worthwhile if you
have a Ykesha!'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes it can be used
for learning skills. Sometimes it affects your mana regeneration. Sometimes you
just have no idea at all. You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane. Do
you know where you are, Winston?' he said.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry
of Support.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'And why do you imagine that we bring people
to this place?'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'To punish them.' </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">'No!' exclaimed Abashi. His voice had changed
extraordinarily, and his face had suddenly become both stern and animated. 'No!
Not merely to extract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why
we have brought you here? To cure you ! To make you sane ! Will you understand,
Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands a
powergamer? We are not interested in those stupid levels that you have attained.
The Vision is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about.
We do not merely delete our enemies, we change them. And soon, you will
understand.'</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">-=-</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It
was the bulletin! Victory! It always meant victory when a trumpet- call preceded
the news. A sort of electric drill ran through the cafe. Even the waiters had
started and pricked up their ears.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous
volume of noise. Already an excited voice was gabbling from the chat channels,
but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside.
The news had run round the streets like magic. He could hear just enough of what
was issuing from the chat to realize that it had all happened, as he had
foreseen; a vast army had secretly assembled a sudden blow within Crushbone, and
Emporer Crush himself had been slain. Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed
themselves through the din: 'Vast strategic manoeuvre -- perfect co-ordination
-- utter rout -- half a million legionnaires slain -- complete demoralization --
control of the whole of Faydwer -- bring the war within measurable distance of
its end victory -- greatest victory in human history -- victory, victory,
victory !'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Under the table Winston's feet made
convulsive movements. He had not stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was
running, swiftly running, he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf.
He looked up again at the portrait of Brad. The colossus that bestrode the
world! The rock against which the hordes of ShowEQ users dashed themselves in
vain! He thought how ten minutes ago-yes, only ten minutes -- there had still
been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from Crushbone
would be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than an Orcish army that had
perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministry of
Support, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened, until
this moment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The voice from the chat channel was still
pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting
outside had died down a little. The waiters were turning back to their work. One
of them approached with the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream,
paid no attention as his glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any
longer. He was back in the Ministry of Support, with everything forgiven, his
soul white as snow. He was in /tells with all of the GMs, confessing everything,
implicating everybody. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the
feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. The long
hoped-for ban was on his screen..</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">But it was all right, everything was all
right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved
the Vision. </font></p>
