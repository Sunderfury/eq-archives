  THIS BRIEF WORD FROM SNICKERS</b></font></p>

<p>Murmandamus, the Evil Bastard, posted his recollections of our sojourn <a href="http://lum.webtoys.net/msg/index.cgi?read=140">here</a>. 

  He was also drunk, although I think he is more used to being drunk and thus 

  remembered more.</p>

<p>Crimson Ghost, the Malicious Bastard, informs me that the pix are developed 

  and winging their way to Casa Del Lummo via post post haste.</p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><i>05/03/99 12:30 PM </i><b>MORE FROM BRITFEST 99</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I continue to regain 

  consciousness from driving for 20 hours within 2 days, things come back to me 

  from the Austin player's lunch. Note that due to those &quot;experiments&quot; 

  back in college, at any moment factual recollections may change into stuff I 

  just made up without warning.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lord British, Murm and I 

  had a pretty interesting discussion about the Ultima Collection, prompted by 

  Murm'</font>s being unable to actually run most of it. Basically LB plans to, 

  once Ultima: Ascenscion is released, redo the older Ultimas using the Ascenscion 

  engine. He'd also like to take the opportunity, a la George Lucas, to rework 

  much of the earlier ones since it was pretty hard to cram actual plot and characterization 

  into an Atari 400. I asked why OSI didn't just port the tile-based Ultimas (1 

  through 5) to a more Windows 95-friendly engine, since that would seem to be 

  the quickest way to preserve the older titles. LB agreed that it would be easy, 

  but the problem was no one save us terminal Ultima geeks would actually pay 

  money for them (after all, <a href="http://www.powerup.com.au/%7Emfleming/ultima/u4download.html" target="_blank">OSI 

  gives Ultima 4 out for free</a>). This does go against Origin's announced intentions 

  to only do online games (which was reinforced in his talk), so unless they're 

  planning on releasing a massively multiplayer Ultima: Pagan, we're probably 

  out of luck for the forseeable future.</p>

<p>Lord British said that Wing Commander Online (or Privateer Online, which I'm 

  sure is what it will turn into anyway) was an on again off again project that 

  was currently off again, but is their number 2 priority (number 1 presumably 

  being that last single player game they're shoving out the door currently). 

</p>

<p>Every attendee got an Official UO knicknack (a UO zipper thingy that hangs 

  onto your zipper or something). I'm sure it will appear on eBay shortly if you 

  want your own.</p>

<p>Oh, and speaking of official UO knicknacks, after much discussion, our group 

  has decided that LadyMOI is in fact a babe. We have a sexist and demeaning nickname 

  for her now, as befitting her new objectified status, but it would really only 

  make sense if you came of age in the early 80's.</p>

<p align="left">Well, I spent much of this weekend in Austin with my posse Murmandamus 

  the Evil Bastard and Crimson Ghost the Malicious Bastard. We had all heard a 

  vicious rumor that some dude who styled himself Lord British was going to show 

  up, so of course we had to go laugh at him. After an hour of warming up (which 

  consisted of drinking tequila and muttering &quot;yeah, I can take 'em&quot; 

  to ourselves in an apparently lesbian bar) we were all shepherded upstairs and 

  proceeded to sit at tables and stare sullenly at the pale-faced geeks who were 

  staring sullenly at the pale-faced geeks across from them. </p>

<p align="left">Richard Garriot and entourage showed up (note: not in frilly cuffs), 

  and after a bit he sat at our table. I figured I'd be cool and be, like, undercover 

  (plus I really didn't have a whole lot to say since I was busily struggling 

  with my low alcohol tolerance), which lasted all of three seconds...</p>

<blockquote> 

  <p>Sir Fragmor: <i>So, Richard, have you ever read &quot;<a href="soak.html" target="_blank">The 

    Rantings of Lum the Mad</a>&quot;? </i></p>

  <p>Lord British: <i>Actually I was warned about him...</i></p>

  <p>Sir Fragmor: <i>That's him, right there. (points at Lum, sitting next to 

    LB)</i></p>

  <p>Lord British: <i>(looks down at Lum) Oh REALLY.</i></p>

  <p>Lum: <i>(tries to look innocent, but only succeeds in looking like a gimp) 

    Hi.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>After that bit of unpleasantness was ended, he held forth about his new castle 

  for a while (he's building an escape tunnel to the sea now, or something like 

  that), and also had a few things to say about the future of UO. Basically, the 

  next set of enhancements will be designed to make the game more accessible to 

  newbies. This includes newbie training areas in game (such as a newbie dungeon), 

  developing an automated quest engine that one or two people can use for quests, 

  and a greatly expanded offline component, similar to the current demo on the 

  T2A CD. Also in the far future are enhancements to the game engine for advanced 

  users, including a plugin to allow for a 3D view of the world and eventually 

  UO2, which you will somehow be able to move your current UO characters to.</p>

<p>We were all pretty impressed with LB; he seemed a great deal like a &quot;cool 

  boss&quot;... someone who has kind of a vague idea of where he wants the company 

  to go, but actually delegates the details to the people responsible for implementing 

  it. Any questions about UO's specifics he almost always referred to Designer 

  Dragon or Dupre (Rich Vogel, the UO project leader). Plus, he really wasn't 

  that much of a gimp, so it was hard to make fun of him. </p>

<p>After all, despite being the object of scorn and hatred for UO players everywhere, 

  he actually had the cojones to <b>meet</b> those players, as opposed to the 

  &quot;Sullen GM Table&quot; where about 8 GMs, all in various stages of body 

  piercing, none of which were old enough to order drinks legally, stared morosely 

  at each other, radiating waves of &quot;they-told-me-to-be-here-they-didn't-tell-me-to-like-it-goddamit&quot;. 

  Every so often we pointed and laughed at the sullen-GM-table and made them feel 

  even more uncomfortable. It was our job, after all.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="britfest-pics/gm1.jpg" width="425" height="152"><br>

  <font size="2">The GM table, without adult supervision.</font><br>

</p>

<p align="center"><img src="britfest-pics/gm2.jpg" width="425" height="163"><br>

  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;So tell me, 

  who is this Senith chap?&quot;</font><br>

</p>

<p>Soon there was a Q&amp;A session between the assembled players and the dev 

  team. Here's the notes I tried to take (my PDA didn't work well in the darkness, 

  so many of my notes read &quot;dd said pxyl1$achg2.,qe as well as boards&quot;):</p>

<ul>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In game email is coming. 

    God only knows why since every player is assumed to have out-of-game email, 

    but it is.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Good and evil is on the 

    back burner since no one can agree on what &quot;evil&quot; is and whether 

    or not &quot;evil&quot; should be a synonym for &quot;PK&quot;. Eventually 

    there will be much discussion between all the players, and after its apparent 

    that they won't even be able to agree on how to spell &quot;evil&quot;, the 

    dev team will do something.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Customizable vendors 

    (names, clothing, hair style, sexual preference) were requested and put &quot;on 

    the list.&quot; Murmandamus asked to see the list.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was asked if the dev 

    team had seen Coral's <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/%7Ecoral_of_minoc/supersite/Quest/questmain.htm" target="_blank">quest 

    engine proposal</a>. They said that they had but thought that it would be 

    too &quot;human intensive&quot;. They were working on a dynamic, automated 

    quest system as part of the forthcoming newbiefication of UO (see above).</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A GM asked an obviously 

    prompted question - &quot;When are players going to be able to filter snow 

    in UO?&quot; Many players laughed in unison and said that it <a href="http://www.tugsoft.com/UOAssist/Help/common_page.htm">already 

    WAS filtered in UOA</a>. The dev team of course ignored this and said that 

    it was on the list, along with Arm/Disarm and Last Target and, well, anything 

    else that they could think of that would put Tug out of bidness. Someone else 

    asked that since Origin seemed hellbent on putting Tug out of bidness anyway, 

    why not just buy him out and save months of reverse engineering time. Rich 

    Vogel then proceeded to wax eloquent on how, and I am paraphrasing here as 

    little as possible, only the OSI dev team knew the source code well and how 

    the source code worked, and they really only had confidence in their own programmers, 

    and, well, they just didn't trust the quality of any third party code. In 

    heaven, Jesus wept.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The inevitable Unattended 

    Macroing question came up. The dev team said that unattended macroing was 

    bad because it created an unfair advantage against those, like Rich Vogel, 

    who tried to play the game the way it was MEANT to be played, dammit. Someone 

    from the GM table yelled &quot;and it wastes bandwidth&quot;. Lum said a dirty 

    word under his breath. Lum asked DD that, if the problem with macroing was 

    that it threw the skill curve out of whack, wouldn't the simpler solution 

    be to just remove the effect of global skill use out of the equation? (aka 

    not checking to see how many blacksmiths are macroing blacksmithy and factoring 

    that into the skill gain rate for blacksmithing.) DD said No. Lum whined Why 

    not? DD said because three day shake and bake PKs would become three minute 

    shake and bake PKs. Lum muttered another dirty word under his breath.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone asked if T2A 

    was ever going to be open for housing. DD said that instead a real estate 

    economy was going to be implemented because the world was, you know, full. 

    So instead of building new houses players would have to sell their old ones. 

    House maintenance will probably go in some day to encourage you pinheads to 

    sell those 30 houses you're holding on to on your spare accounts.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone asked if forges 

    would ever be allowed on boats. DD said no, since boats were being used too 

    much as houses anyway, and there were some changes in store for boats to discourage 

    this.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone asked if the 

    server lines had been changed. Faceless was surprised that Stratics hadn't 

    already reverse engineered the new server line locations, and said that the 

    Stratics guys could just email him to find out where they were, which would 

    probably be quicker.</font></li>

</ul>

<p>Richard Garriot then gave a short speech which basically sketched out UO's 

  long term future as a VR sort of Amway, where if you got enough &quot;points&quot; 

  you could have OSI fly you out to Austin and digitize your spirit and send it 

  into the Matrix where you could duel to the death with the Men in Black and 

  hang with Keanu Reeves, who knows kung fu. </p>

<p>Afterwards, it developed that the dev team all read this page and are great 

  fans and in fact will probably link to it from owo.com just to spite me and 

  make me look like I sold out to the Man. (Lum says another dirty word.) </p>

<p>And they asked, along with everyone else, when I was going to ask Lord British 

  THE QUESTION. The question I had threatened to ask for, god, weeks now, and 

  held in dark secrecy. That question, as I had planned it, was this.</p>

<blockquote> 

  <p><i>Mr. Garriot, I work on a UO related website, and as research for that 

    I came upon <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/thesite/0797w4/play/play733jump2_072497.html" target="_blank">an 

    interview you gave</a> for the Site, a web-related TV show on MSNBC, where 

    you said that the key to a successful online game was the ability for the 

    players to feel as if they mattered, by involving them in a greater plot, 

    and key to that would be the regular appearance of you as Lord British and 

    Starr Long as Lord Blackthorne, interacting with the world and its players 

    on a regular basis. My question is -- what happened?</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sounds noble and coherent and to the point, no? Well, as mentioned before, 

  I had basically turned into a drunken gimp that day, and my QUESTION turned 

  into:</p>

<blockquote> 

  <p><i>Um, er, how come you're never online?</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The answer.. well, here it is.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: I'm online as Lord 

    British once a week.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: You ARE? (goggles)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: Yes, but you know, 

    I'm just one person, out of a hundred thousand players, and word doesn't usually 

    get out when I'm there.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: But... but people 

    have ICQ, and IRC... and...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: Not everyone has ICQ 

    or IRC. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: So what do you do 

    when you're on?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: I'm usually led by 

    GMs to player establishments, to place plaques and give speeches and the like. 

    Sometimes I like to go on adventures with players, and occasionally I'll take 

    a GM call...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: You TAKE GM CALLS?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: Yes, it's very instructive. 

    I try to do it once a month or so.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: What GM are you?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LB: I show up as GM Lord 

    British.</font></p>

  <p>Murmandamus: So, is there any chance that &quot;invulnerable&quot; tag over 

    your head will go away?</p>

  <p>LB: (backs away) Well, there's always the chance that a mistake will happen 

    and someone will accidentally clear the flag... um, I have to go.</p>

</blockquote>

<p align="left">So there you have it. If you macro unattended, LORD BRITISH WILL 

  BAN THEE!</p>

<p align="left">It was an interesting weekend overall. Texas is very big and I 

  drove through most of it at high speeds. The web site was in capable hands while 

  I was gone, although rumors that <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com/" target="_blank">Fear</a> 

  will be interviewing the puppy are probably false. </p>
