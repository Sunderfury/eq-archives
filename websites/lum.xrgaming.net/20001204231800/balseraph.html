  with Brian &quot;Balseraph&quot; Urbanek<br>
  </font>Programmer, Wolfpack Studios</b><br>
  <font size="2">(<i>3/3/00) Mr.Urbanek is currently working on <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/">Shadowbane</a>, 
  an ORPG which already has a suprisingly vocal and avid fan base. Myschyf, our 
  intrepid Amazon correspondent, caught up with him for this interview.</i></font></font> 
</p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>How long have 
  you been gaming?</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly twenty years. 
  At the age of nine, my neighbor across the street who was four years older than 
  me got me to play in a game of D&amp;D with him.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
  was hooked forever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>What games have 
  you played?&nbsp; You mentioned LARPs, D&amp;D, and other RPGs in your posts.&nbsp; 
  Who? What? When? Where? Specifics?</i><br>
  <br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Um…. all 
  of them. My favorites are the WhiteWolf system for their theme and world (plus 
  I’ve even done some writing for them), Champions for the brilliance of its design; 
  Fading Suns, Shadowrun, both of the TSR Saga Games (Dragonlance 5<sup>th</sup> 
  Age and Marvel Super Heroes) and (of course) AD&amp;D.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not quite making 
  the “favorites” list are uncountable other products, each with their own touch 
  of brilliance – In Nomine, Ars Magica, Gurps, Everway, Earthdawn, 7<sup>th</sup> 
  Seas, Aria, SenZar, Scraypers, Rifts, Unknown Armies, Armageddon, and a few 
  dozen others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I’ve run as many 
  as three campaigns, using three different systems, per week. My best campaign 
  was an AD&amp;D Birthright game that lasted for three years, and only ended 
  because I moved to Texas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I LARP whenever 
  I get the chance, particularly at cons… it’s a great way to meet people and 
  be social while gaming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I also enjoy Renfaire, 
  the source of the enclosed pic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Obviously you’re 
  a programmer and it sounds like you’re a game designer too.&nbsp; Have you developed 
  or designed any other games?&nbsp; Which ones? How long did you work at the 
  various companies?&nbsp; How much actual impact did you have on the various 
  games.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, I used to 
  work in my home town of Pittsburgh at Dreamforge. It was a great company, and 
  they gave me the opportunity to pursue design, which I went after with great 
  enthusiasm. The main title that I have to my credit is the WarHammer 40K adaptation, 
  Rites of War. I was lead design on that project, as well as the “vice lead” 
  programmer. </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
  is a really great underlying object oriented engine in Rites of War that I developed 
  that was my primary selling point to Wolfpack. It was extremely robust and functional, 
  and I think the guys here could see that, and “liked my style.” The rest, as 
  they say, is history.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>What 
  brought you to WP? You pursue them?&nbsp; They pursue you? Had you heard about 
  SB before you came there?&nbsp; If so, what about the game attracted you?</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yeah, I knew about 
  Wolfpack and Shadowbane beforehand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a matter of 
  course, I try keep up to the nanosecond tabs on the industry, and to play every 
  game I can get my hands on, whether it’s my style or not. I firmly believe that 
  a good idea can be found everywhere, and I really like to keep in touch with 
  the industry – and that certainly includes consoles. An unfortunate side effect 
  of that is that I don’t get to spend nearly as much time in individual games 
  as I would like.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That’s where sites 
  like Lum’s come into the picture. I’ve been an avid reader of Lum’s since the 
  GM Darwin scandal quite a ways back. I had even posted infrequently over the 
  year or so I’ve been reading it, under my previous pseudonym of Raziel, which 
  I abandoned when that damned Konami game came out. So, about a year ago or so, 
  Lum talks about an up and coming game called “Shadowbane”. I go to their site, 
  check it out, and file it away for later reference.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, I was growing 
  dissatisfied with Dreamforge’s direction – to put it simply, there weren’t any 
  RPGs in the scheduled lineup, and I wanted to make one… bad. I sent out a couple 
  feelers to companies with projects that looked promising, and Wolfpack was right 
  near the top of the list. In January, I flew down for a spur of the moment interview. 
  </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
  to the attraction… well, to be honest, the whole “play to crush” thing had me 
  worried at first… I was afraid it was going to be a ravenous bunch of pkers 
  with no real appreciation for role playing as I understood it. I couldn’t have 
  been more wrong. The scope of the game is extremely broad, concentrating on 
  politics, warfare, intrigue, storyline.. I actually much prefer the original 
  tagline (“Join a Clan, Secure a Throne, Build an Empire”) because, from a game 
  design standpoint at least, that seems to be more what the game is about.  The 
  phrase “Play to Crush” is used in the office with a bit of a tongue-in-cheek 
  tone.. but, unfortunately, that doesn’t really come through over the ‘net.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Except 
  Belthior. He just plays to crush. But hey – it takes all kinds, no?</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
  anyway, they showed me what they had and gave me the inside scoop, I loved it, 
  and three weeks later, I was at a desk in Austin.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>What do you 
  think makes a good MMORPG.&nbsp; What are the most important factors?&nbsp; 
  Why?<br>
  </i><br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having the 
  rules change every week, hard caps for character abilities, and spawn points 
  that can be camped endlessly are definite musts. Also, it is very important 
  that a key feature, like being able to own a house, be impossible for any player 
  who wasn’t involved in the first month of playing, because newbies suck. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bleh. That left 
  an awful taste in my mouth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seriously, the 
  most important thing in a role playing game to me is character, and the importance 
  is increased a hundred fold in a MMORPG (we need a shorter acronym, and PSW 
  ain’t it.).  It is extremely important to me that every player be able to craft 
  a character that matches an internally held vision, and to develop him so that 
  he feels like he is, if not unique, at least special, and if not the best, at 
  least one of the best. At the same time, every character needs to have weaknesses, 
  to have made trade offs, to have sacrificed things in his quest for power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  making for more interesting characters, this makes for good community. When 
  other characters aren’t easily replaceable commodities (I want to join your 
  guild! I’m a 7x GM Tank Mage! / Great… so are our other twenty members. Get 
  lost.) but distinct entities in themselves, who can both contribute to a team 
  and require the backing of others in certain circumstances, it fosters cooperation 
  and camaraderie.<br>
  <br>
  <i>SB first put an emphasis on 'crushing' an opponent and then, it seemed, backed 
  of a bit and touted the RP aspects of the game.&nbsp; You (or maybe it was Varios) 
  said in some posts that you and many of the other guys at WP are roleplayers 
  and I can't see a group of roleplayers just making a 'bash the other guy' type 
  of game.&nbsp; But then, the other day, on Lum's board, you said &quot;gameplay 
  programmer + love of military strategy = game mechanics that support military 
  strategy.&quot;&nbsp; Do you really feel that SB is going to appeal to roleplayers 
  and the tradition non-powergamer type of player?&nbsp; How so?&nbsp; How about 
  those folks that don't give a rats ass about military strategy?&nbsp; Will there 
  be a place in SB for them?&nbsp; Where? <br>
  </i> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WARNING!!!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONG RANT EXPRESSING 
  MY <b>PERSONAL</b> OPINIONS! THESE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT REFLECT THE OFFICIAL VIEWS 
  OF WOLFPACK, OR ARE MEANT TO BE INDICITIVE OF ANY “OFFICIAL” COMPANY STATEMENT!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right, that’s the 
  big issue, huh? Well, I guess it comes down to your perspective on the thing. 
  Let me put it this way: Everquest has no real PvP, but how much role playing 
  actually occurs? I mean, sure, you can scream “Have at thee!” all day when your 
  paladin fights a demon thing on the Plane of Hate, but battle cries at AI critters 
  is hardly role playing in my book.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  kind of role playing that Wolfpack is going for in Shadowbane has less to do 
  with Le Morte De Arthur and more to do with Braveheart -- intrigue, betrayal, 
  loyalty, honor, and fighting over something that you believe in. Without a background 
  of tension and the risk of great tragedy, moments of sublime beauty start to 
  lose their impact after a while.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-weight:normal'>I 
  don’t like the “crush” moniker. Crushing your opposition, in and of itself, 
  is a wonderful thing. Crushing doesn’t interfere with role playing. It’s the 
  perception that “crushing” is the whole point of Shadowbane that I have a problem 
  with, because it’s not. That’s a gross understatement of a system that was designed.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-weight:normal'>Yes, 
  there is crushing. Crushing your opposition, seeing them driven before you, 
  and hearing the lamentations of their spouses (heh) is an absolutely supported 
  means of gaining territory and resources for your guild, kingdom, and empire. 
  The key is, it is only one of the solutions, and it won’t likely be the best 
  one in most cases. Going to war with other guilds costs. It costs A LOT. It 
  costs time, it costs XP as guild members die, it costs money as weapons and 
  equipment are destroyed or looted, and it leaves you vulnerable to attacks from 
  other fronts. Diplomacy, economic alliances, assassinations, covert warfare, 
  religious conversion…. those are ALSO all methods of strengthening your empire. 
  To me, when all you can do is crush, it isn’t role playing. When you could negotiate, 
  but instead choose to crush, that is role playing.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What we’re after 
  is the tensions and drama of a dynamic, thriving political society.  That means 
  that people will learn to work together, because we, unlike UO or EQ, are going 
  to give players things worth fighting over – cities, guilds, religions, and 
  ideologies.  People have focused so much on the “I can fight other players!” 
  aspect of the game that they’re missing the big picture of what we’re building.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sure, a lot of 
  players are going to form “bandit kingdoms” like the Knights of Chaos and try 
  to screw the game up. Hopefully, they will be destructive enough to inspire 
  blessed outrage among the guilds and the cities, and be crushed under an onslaught 
  of role playing righteousness.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-weight:normal'>It’s 
  true that player justice completely failed in UO. However, we are a different 
  beast than UO. See, In UO, the same people were the antis as were the dreads. 
  It was easy, because both roles required the same skill set, and let them do 
  the same thing – indiscriminately kill other players. The tradesmen players, 
  on the other hand, would need to have multiple skill sets, equipment derived 
  from divergent sources… and, in most of the cases, being a hard core PK wasn’t 
  what they wanted to do anyway. The system had no accountability, and no motivation 
  besides basic human morality (oh, if only that were enough…) for “good” players 
  to rise up.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shadowbane is different. 
  We have accountability, in the form of guilds with fixed bases of operation 
  and crests. If someone kills you, you’ll know where they came from. We’ll have 
  motivation to defend your allies and fellows, because everyone jointly contributes 
  to a guild’s and city’s productivity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And, of course, 
  if anyone starts to go out of their way to not just play evil (which I’m all 
  in favor of) but get really nasty and attempts to screw with other PLAYERS and 
  ruin the game (like hacked res killing… which, by the way,  is impossible in 
  our engine), the Dark Angel may pay a visit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for “powergamers” 
  in general…. see, this is a point of contention for me. What is it about trying 
  to make a character as powerful and competitive as possible is it that rules 
  out role playing? It isn’t the goal that should be hated – it’s the methodology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Take two UO characters 
  – one power macroed overnight (okay, over a week) a 7x GM Tank Mage. The other 
  played with friends, hunted monsters, and built a 7x GM Tank Mage over the course 
  of a year, all with the goal of being a great hero and striving to rid the land 
  of evil (or bring it to its knees). Both have the same character in the end, 
  and both may very well have “elite skills”. Both can be considered  powergamers. 
  One is also a role player, and one is not.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
  like powergaming role players. People who would build up a character through 
  loopholes and exploits, however, I have no use for. Do they have a place in 
  the game? Absolutely. Will they enjoy Shadowbane? Probably. If they pay their 
  money and DON’T RUIN THE GAME FOR OTHERS, then they have the right to play the 
  game however they want, and I have the obligation to make sure that they have 
  fun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I take that obligation 
  very seriously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Are you guys 
  gonna get a cute girl with lotsa teeth to be yer PR person for those trying 
  times when you need to divert attention away from problems with your game? </i></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">God, 
  I hope so! </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking 
  of which, can you get me Lady MOI’s email address? Or is she still married? 
  I lost track….</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>What 
  do you think it is about an MMORPG that can keep a player interested over many 
  years.&nbsp; I'm not talking about 1 or 2 years -- that's small change.&nbsp; 
  I'm talking about 5, 6 or even more years.&nbsp; I know a lot of people kept 
  playing NWN for almost the entire time it was around without any type of possible 
  character growth or game support (meaning new patches or expansions).&nbsp; 
  And when Kesmai slapped a GUI on IOK and called it LOK there were players that 
  ported over their 10-year-old characters from Compuserve.&nbsp; Do you envision 
  this type of player loyalty for SB?&nbsp; What is it about SB that makes you 
  think you can keep players interested for that long?</i></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Damn. 
  Tough one. I will admit this: I don’t fully understand the marketplace today. 
  Then again, that’s not my job – that’s Warden’s job. What I do understand is 
  the mindset of the hardcore player and hardcore roleplayer… exactly the kind 
  of player that you’re talking about. I understand it because I’m both of them.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
  me, gameplay is everything. I recently replayed Ultima III and IV (not to completion, 
  though) just to get back in touch with that kind of experience. Until Age of 
  Wonders came out, I still had Master of Magic on my system and played it regularly, 
  and I played a few missions on the first X-Com a two weeks ago.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think it comes 
  down to this : 70% of  Shadowbane’s audience will leave us three years from 
  release when the next big thing comes out, just like they’ll leave Ultima Online 
  when Shadowbane, UO2, EQ2, and whatever else is in the pipeline come out. The 
  other thirty percent, the hard core, people like me, people who have tired UO 
  and EQ and AC and rejected them for us, and will be hard core with us for as 
  long as we support it. This is because Shadowbane unquestionably has the breadth, 
  the depth, and the features to keep someone playing it for a decade without 
  ever being able to fully explore every option.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides, 
  I firmly intend to make certain that the next big thing after Shadowbane is 
  another Wolf Pack product.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>What 
  kind of impact are you, personally, going to have on the design and development 
  of the game?&nbsp; What changes are you bringing?&nbsp; Do you just listen to 
  Ashton's and Belthior's ideas and then say yes, well I can code that or no, 
  that would be a coding nightmare, or are you actively involved in the game design?&nbsp; 
  </i> </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
  am NOT actively involved in design. Wolfpack had a hundred and fifty page design 
  doc complete and ready when I walked in the door, and it would be insane for 
  them to let some newcomer change it on them. Are there things I would have done 
  different? Of course. The key is this, though: though overall vision of Shadowbane 
  is wonderful, and THAT I wouldn’t change a bit.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
  will, however, have tremendous influence over the details. I was hired exclusively 
  to help “fill in the blanks” of the game system implementation.   This includes 
  things like combat and spell casting, so I’m uniquely qualified to suggest to 
  the design team how they can be best tweaked. Plus, since I have to essentially 
  memorize every formula and number, as well as EXACTLY how they interrelate, 
  I’m in a good position to spot imbalances and imperfections or loopholes that 
  may have slipped into the system. That’s actually one of the reasons they hired 
  me, because my experience makes me extremely suited to just that role.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>You've said 
  more than once in your posts that SB is going to kick ass in the market place.&nbsp; 
  Why? What makes you say that?&nbsp; </i></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shadowbane 
  is going to kick ass because we have a style of gameplay and feature set that 
  is built around the idea of supporting and encouraging what people already try 
  to do in UO and EQ without support – build powerful, distinct characters and 
  form a great, self maintaining community.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eventually, 
  the success of any game in the market comes down to this : is the game fun to 
  play?  All the marketing in the world can’t fix a bad game design (well, okay, 
  it could probably help you sell units.  But it certainly can’t help you build 
  a community) and we’re going to build a game that is incredibly fun, even if 
  it kills us.  We're hungrier than the other guys and we’ve got a great vision 
  for the game we want to build.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
  it just comes down to execution.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Thanks 
  Balseraph for a great and informative interview!  And thanks also go out to 
  Warden for making him beef up the RP parts ::wink!:: (you really didn’t expect 
  all this free publicity for nothing, did you?  You have to let me get in at 
  least ONE jibe.)</i></font></p>
