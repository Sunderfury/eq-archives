<blockquote> 

  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I first got to 

    Origin, I was actually keen on using a name I've used in roleplaying games 

    for a long time. Xavia.. but, as a community person, I felt that perhaps I 

    should allow myself to be named by the community. </font></i></p>

  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first place I started 

    talked to people was on the Horizon's board, for the Ascension crowd.. and 

    I proposed this to them. They took to the idea like fish to water. </font></i></p>

  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">RG's pet name for my 

    position was the "Minister of Information" and I shared that detail with the 

    board. After a couple of iterations on the M.O.I. theme, Lady MOI was chosen 

    by the group, and I accepted the name. </font></i></p>

  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we put the official 

    Ascension boards up at Origin, they technology didn't allow for spaces, and 

    so the space between Lady and MOI was dropped. LadyMOI.</font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>There ya go...<br>

    Carly</i></font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I still like the name &quot;Spin 

  Dragon&quot;. But I'll accept that we in the UO community take second place 

  to those U:A dweebs. However, I think LadySpinMOIDragon had a pretty cool idea. 

  So let's rename Lum! What do you think I should be named? Dippy Dragon? Scourge 

  of Binky? A$$r0x0R? <a href="mailto:lum@webtoys.net">Send em in.</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It makes sense, given enough

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Correction noted. On a far 

  less important note, <a href="mailto:sirfragmor@yahoo.com">Sir Fragmor</a> has 

  something to say:</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Community. </font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Community would assume 

    people together being social. This was one of UOs big selling points way back 

    when and you can still hear them chanting it today. "It hurts the community", 

    "It would'nt be good for the online gaming community" Well its funny that 

    they have these concerns about the "community" cause THEY themselves are setting 

    forth precendents that will hurt the "Community" much more than any macro-miner 

    or PK. A commune of people suggests interaction between members of players. 

    Be that team work in fighting monsters, defeating PKs, questing, or treasure 

    hunting. The point is these are all things that help Build, Make, and perpetuate 

    the "community" because they are social in nature, as is a "community". </i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Recently the Dev Team 

    has started to crack down on "unassisted" macroing due to its terrible affects 

    on the game balance. I find it odd that a given UO player who has: an intrnet 

    connection, a web browser, and access to the same FREE download sites that 

    I do, is at a disadvantage simply because THEY do not choose to use any of 

    those tools to download a free program and macro. At this point it becomes 

    a active CHOICE of a UO player to NOT macro. The software to macro is FREE, 

    they all are required to have the tools to download it, per reqs on the box 

    that the game came in, so WHY exactly is my macroing with EZMacros a game 

    imbalance? </i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I digress... </i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Back to the "community" 

    issue. There is no communal effort involved in cutting up fish steaks. There 

    is no teamwork invloved in cooking meat. There is no festive esprit de corps 

    whilst mining ore. There is no roleplaying when determining the Dexterity 

    and Physical Strength or Intelligence of the town cryer. Here is where we 

    find OSI putting the players of UO at odds with 2 directives. On the one hand, 

    you need these NON COMMUNITY building skills in order to actually participate 

    in COMMUNITY activites and have fun. You need meat for food, cooking to prepare 

    it, Ore for armor, Anatomy and Eval Int for PvP and PvM capabilities but wait!! 

    On the OTHER hand......actually building ANY of these skills requires HOURS 

    and HOURS of NON SOCIAL, NON INTERACTIVE, NON TEAM ORIENTED time. This time 

    is normally spent macroing overnight while the player is sleeping or doing 

    other real life things. When they actually want to play this Community Oriented 

    game they dont want to play it doing non community things. OSI obviously is 

    being extremely doubleminded in their efforts. OSI, we HEAR you, we WANT to 

    help the community by actually BEING PART OF IT. A player ISNT part of a Community 

    if they are sitting there cutting up fish steaks not talking with other players. 

    Why is this a hard concept to ascertain?!?!?! </i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Sorry for the rant 

    here, I just got sick and tired of OSI. </i></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Excellent points. I have 

  some more to say on community, why Everquest doesn't have it, and why UO may 

  lose it soon. Until then, keep that email coming in; it keeps me from having 

  to make stuff up!</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(By the way, why doesn't 

  Origin just give Dr. TwisTer access to the Seekrit Counselor channel? Oh, that's 

  right, he doesn't need to, half the channel sends him a log every time IronWill 

  farts.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I started this page, 

  it was, believe it or not, to provide some sort of balance to the constant OSI 

  bashing going on. <a href="wannabesenithwhenigrowup.html">L'affaire Senith was 

  still raging</a> (what, all of two weeks ago?) and it seemed like Pick On The 

  Smurfs Week every web site I visited. So I vented a little on how I thought 

  all parties were equally stupid, Dr. TwisTer picked up on it, and away weeee 

  gooooo. Good thing my job basically requires me to sit by the phone and wait 

  for stupid people to call.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, I had no idea 

  that the entire support staff of UO would take this time to go <b>collectively 

  mad.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It all started when someone 

  deigned to tell Tug over at <a href="http://www.tugsoft.com/UOAssist/" target="_blank">UOA 

  Central</a> that his proggy wasn't ever going to be approved since it encouraged 

  automated macroing. We all laughed at that one. Come on! Everyone macros! The 

  game design is built around it! </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They weren't joking. Folks 

  are <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/jov/images/macroban.jpg" target="_blank">really 

  being booted for macroing</a>. I haven't heard of folks being banned for macroing 

  yet, but surely that's coming. I personally have pretty consistently gotten 

  Connection Lost's for the past couple nights while placidly sitting in Skara 

  Brae with my newbie miner trying to work my strength up so that I can carry 

  more than 10 pounds at a time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.murderdeathkill.com/">MDK 

  got banned</a>. Now I know, everyone in MDK was a waste of bodily fluids. Still. 

  Collective punishment is just wrong. It's like saying my guildmates need to 

  be banned because I write a web page that liberally uses the word &quot;fuck&quot;. 

  (Lum watches his hit counter suddenly zoom up tenfold from search engine hits.) 

  </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And now all the <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/let-src.html">sordid 

  little bitching and moaning</a> among the Counselor/SRC/Seer/GM cliques is out 

  in the open. As LadyMOI would say, &quot;Woop! Woop!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This has many layers of 

  sadness. I'll just exposit a little by telling you my personal experiences with 

  all of this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A guildmate of mine had 

  something weird happen. I won't explain exactly what, but it was of such a nature 

  that combined with everything else going on this week, he was VERY paranoid 

  about being banned for no apparent reason. (It probably would not be a big surprise 

  if I told you he was macroing at the time.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A close friend of mine is 

  involved in the UO Support Program, and has access to all the Seekrit Channels. 

  So I was able, through him, to very quickly gain access to folks who could try 

  to find out exactly what was going on and why. It was all pretty much straightened 

  out quickly and efficiently, like customer support is, y'know, supposed to work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nature of what happened 

  was interesting enough that I thought it would merit an update here. But I didn't 

  want to antagonize the people who had just helped me out (not to mention pissing 

  my wife off), so I chatted for a second with the support person he was talking 

  to.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I wanted to explain who 

  I was, what page I write for (he had never heard of it, but assumed it was a 

  TwisTer clone - gee.) and to clear what I was going to write with him, so that 

  anything that shouldn't be public knowledge wouldn't be. You know, polite stuff. 

  (Believe it or not I like to think I'm a decent enough sort in real life.)</font> 

</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The response was one hundred 

  percent stonewall. You will not misquote me, what you thought I said was wrong, 

  I don't appreciate you doing what you're doing, especially with the issues the 

  support program is having right now.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got pretty pissed at this 

  point. Issues?, I said. Lately the players have been having a few &quot;issues&quot; 

  as well. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The conversation 

  closed at that point, unsurprisingly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hell of it is, the person 

  I was talking to, up until that point, I thought was a friend. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are the enemy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that is an issue that 

  needs solving way before any of that other <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/let-src.html" target="_blank">petty 

  bullshit</a>.</font></p>
