  CAN ALWAYS BORROW MY COPYRIGHT LAWYER, KEVIN MURPHY OF THE MUSHROOM</font></font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not going to be many updates this 
  weekend as I take a well-deserved break from online zaniness while I wait patiently, 
  *oh* so patiently on my new PC to be shipped. (PIII 450 Bay-beeeeee! Now I many 
  actually be able to run Everquest.) So I'll be spending most of the weekend 
  PC time instead playing Might &amp; Magic 7, which my feeble P200 can actually 
  run. (It's a lot like Everquest, only with not nearly as much killstealing.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wanted to touch on this latest Sooper 
  D00per <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">Dr. TwisTer 
  ExpoSe</a> with <a href="http://www.uo.com/">Stratics</a>. Stratics are the 
  Army of Light, as far as I'm concerned. They know more about UO then, well, 
  UO does (I recall a UOHoC Chat where DD said, incredulously, &quot;you mean 
  archers can drink potions with bows equipped?&quot;). If you are a number cruncher, 
  a powergamer, or just wanted to know how many years it would take to make GM 
  Smith, you probably have Stratics on your bookmark list. Unfortunately, it now 
  seems that they also like lawyers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. TwisTer seems to have discovered 
  that Stratics doesn't like to publish information that reflects negatively on 
  OSI. Well golly gee, Mr. Bill, whatever gave you that clue. I guess the fact 
  that they resolutely refuse to ever mention the words &quot;Dr. TwisTer&quot; 
  never gave you a clue. (They also refuse to acknowledge I exist either, but 
  hey, I can live with this. I'm a reasonably well adjusted web guy. Hell, I can 
  always e-mail <a href="mailto:ctaylor@origin.ea.com">Neve Campbell</a> if I 
  get lonely. SHE admits that I exist. So NYAH, Stratics.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will say that the good folks at 
  Stratics, who I ordinarily have the greatest respect for even if they won't 
  acknowledge my existence, are acting with all the good sense of crazed hyenas 
  here. Obviously, they didn't want to publish this interview. They also, as is 
  standard among journalists, gave their interviewee a copy of the interview, 
  before said decision was made. Both of which make sense. However, when the interviewee 
  publishes that interview, Stratics doesn't have a whole hell of a lot of room 
  to bitch. While they can go on about copyright law and the like, there were 
  two parties in the room when that interview went down, and one of them put it 
  on his web site. While I will freely admit to not being a lawyer (I bow to the 
  journalistic acumen of <a href="http://www.themushroom.com/">my betters</a> 
  on that), it does seem that their continuing to throw their weight around in 
  such a heavy-handed fashion is not only counter-productive, but throws more 
  raw meat TwisTer's way. The smartest thing for UOSS, Inc. (my god, is there 
  such a thing...?) to do is to, um, shut up and let it die. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But no one ever does that. And what 
  do I know? I just run this silly rant site.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone from that guild must have 
    wrote you a letter. The story as you relay it is what they said happened, 
    but is not what really happened. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did say I hacked into their server. 
    That was not the case. I thought it was funny at the time, but what had really 
    happened was a member of the guild was copying the text and sending it to 
    me. Never did I hack the server. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then when I made that comment on 
    line, they said that they went to my ISP in an attempt to get me banned. That 
    never happened. That was a story they had made up to try and make me look 
    bad. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the time that this story played 
    out, I was already with GameHut. They had asked me to come on board way before 
    this situation, and this particular guild actually contacted GameHut (supposedly) 
    to get rid of me. GameHut laughed at them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course if you want the real 
    stories behind the lies that this guild states, then you should read some 
    more of my page later on when some key members of the guild left, and uncovered 
    some of the stuff they have gotten away with in the game. I believe I have 
    a full story posted somewhere, I'm sure you would have no problem finding 
    it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Otherwise... thanks for the plugs.

  <p><font color="#ff0000">Vote For Me </font><font color="#ffffff">- After looking 
    over the poll that is being done right now a little closer, it does appear 
    that it is kinda strange. Obviously someone started the poll from Sonoma, 
    considering the top 10 individuals are from Sonoma. Also, some of the great 
    people of the UO world have just STARTED to appear. For instance, </font><a href="http://imanewbie.crossroadsrpg.com/">ImaNewbie</a><font

 color="#ffffff"> is now located on the poll after I posted this information yesterday. 
    Could it be that Ima reads my site? If so, GREAT, I love </font><a href="http://imanewbie.crossroadsrpg.com/">ImaNewbie</a><font

 color="#ffffff">. I don't know HOW many times I laughed out loud from the comics. 
    Trully, Ima is one of the Greats of UO. If you haven't read his comics </font><a href="http://imanewbie.crossroadsrpg.com/">click 
    here</a><font color="#ffffff">. Anyways, the reason I'm spending some time 
    on this subject is actually for another reason. Yes, you can still vote for 
    me, please do, and it does appear that you get a vote a day, so why not stuff 
    the box with extra votes...after all we are cheaters. But the real reason 
    you want to do this, is because of the members that are already at the top 
    of the list. Despite my friends </font><a href="http://www.xsploitz.com/c%26s/">CrAsHeR 
    &amp; SmAsHeR</a><font color="#ffffff"> and their Real Audio Show, the other 
    top 10s are Role Players. Now hear my cry, it's not me you are voting for, 
    but what I stand for. We MUST work together and beat out these Role Players. 
    How fitting would our work be to see Exploiters beat out the Role Players. 
    So I urge you, one and all, Vote for me, for a better UO world. </font><a href="http://www.freevote.com/votingbooth?uobestofbest">Vote

  <p><font color="#ff0000">Best of the Best</font><font color="#ffffff"> - Recently, 
    there have been some messages appearing on my board, claiming to be better 
    than me, claiming to be in first place in a recent poll for the most famous 
    players in UO. I was kinda curious however to find out just WHO was in first 
    place. I never heard of him, I mean, ImaNewbie is more famous to me then this 
    guy. All in all My opinion, who cares. Until I read this. You must have forgotten 
    who you are messing with - The best of the best &amp; ....a hacker. I ran 
    accross an interesting note while searching through the Syndicate's private 
    forum section for their guild members. How - you may ask did I get into it? 
    Figure it out yourself.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#ffff00">4) Vote: Please spend 5 seconds voting at: <br>
    http://www.freevote.com/votingbooth?uobestofbest We are in 1st place now by 
    156 votes HOWEVER the #2 person continues to rise. Fortunatley despite his 
    cheating we are winning and extending our lead by playing by the RULES. Funny 
    how that seems to work out We play by the rules in all things and still come 
    out on top I appreciate everyones voting efforts. A day or two more and ill 
    stop harassing you so much :P ill still mention it but the push wont be as 
    big to pull out ahead as we will have secured a comfortable lead and enough 
    will keep voting everyday to keep us there. But for now, we NEED you to vote 
    for a couple days more.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#ffffff">On another day I found this posted - Which is totally 
    false.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#ffff00">2) Voting: We added bout 120 new votes yesterday. We 
    soared into the lead by 70 votes. However, the #3 person, Twister, is using 
    an IP cloaker (so Ive been &quot;hinted at by the siteop) and added 90 for 
    himself. Thats pretty cheesy dont you think? We have actual real people voting. 
    He has a program cloaking himself. LAME!!</font></p>
  <p><font color="#ffffff">Just because I run a bug site, doesn't mean that I 
    am cheating in this poll. If anyone is cheating it would be the #1 person, 
    who is clearly above the #2 person by 200 votes. I've said it once and I will 
    say it again...what is the point in cheating in a poll that means nothing. 
    If I really wanted to cheat, you wouldn't even have a chance. Just look at 
    how easy it was to get into your private message board. Now, I have never 
    been one to start a major debate between boards. I even started this site 
    because of all of the whining that UOShack and Xsploitz was doing with each 
    other. None the less, I give up. You win. You are #1, and better than I will 
    ever be. Wow...that was a really super neat o poll. Thanks to all for playing. 
    Now back to reality and information that trully effects our lives.</font></p>

  then moved his site. Now, I used to work at an ISP, and generally we did bust 
  the little scallywags who caused us to actually expend time and effort responding 
  to people's bitching about their activities. However, we didn't let them keep 
  an account. <a href="http://members.home.com/drtwister/">@home did</a>. Unless

    mean, it's unheard of to punish me in this mannor for saying the word "jap". 
    Lets be honest, they admitted they made an error with the banning by reversing 
    it. I would think they'd replace the tower since obviously it shouldn't have

  5:30 PM </i><b>AS PROMISED, UNEDUCATED AND SHALLOW OPINIONS ABOUT ASHERON'S 
  CALL </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I haven't devoted a whole lot of 
  time to Asheron's Call, but I have dabbled in it a bit. Here's what I've picked 
  up on. Note that these are the impressions of a confirmed newbie and are all 
  probably wrong as hell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The interface is professionally done; 
  it beats UO hands down, and it is literally painful to go back to EQ afterwards. 
  Your health, mana and stamina bars are shown at the top of the screen, the chat 
  screen (a la EQ) is on the bottom, and in between is a 3D view of your environment, 
  again similar to EQ. You can call up a control panel on the right third of your 
  screen, which displays all the information you need, such as your paperdoll, 
  your skills, your spells, a help system, etc, in a nice tabbed window. Unlike 
  EQ, there is ZERO delay in calling up your control panel. It is all seamless 
  and FAST. While I can <i>barely</i> run EQ in 640x480 mode on my P200, I can 
  run AC in 800x600 mode comfortably.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The graphics are kind of bland. This 
  is less the fault of the engine, which is capable enough, than of the artists. 
  I'm spoiled by EQ here; after wandering around the claustrophobic alleyways 
  of Qeynos and the marble spires of Erudin, the towns of Dereth (Asheron Call's 
  world) are just blah. This is something that sorely needs attention -- the best 
  engine in the world won't save it without creativity behind it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, I freely note that there 
  may be hugely dramatic vistas in game - I couldn't find them. In my 6 or 7 hours 
  of play I went through the newbie dungeon (a ritual familiar to those veterans 
  of text-based muds) and whacked at rats outside. That's about all I could find 
  to do. A real dungeon would have been nice, or even a wandering orc tribe or 
  something. Dereth is BIG and there's no sign posts pointing &quot;THIS WAY TO 
  CERTAIN DEATH&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Character creation - this is how 
  EQ SHOULD have been done. You can customize your character to the Nth degree, 
  down to the color and cut of his/her newbie clothing. No 5-archetypes-to-choose-from-per-race 
  here. (The races, by the way, are human races, not fantasy ones. Thinly disguised 
  Europeans, Arabs and Japanese; although you can freely set your skin tone to 
  whatever you wish, the facial features you can choose from - and there are a 
  lot - remain those of your ethnicity.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Character advancement is a canny 
  blend of the best of EQ and UO. While you advance in levels, those levels are 
  more guide markers than anything else (although they do allow you eventually 
  to designate more skills that your character specializes in.) What is really 
  neat is that you can use the experience points you earn by spending them on 
  skill gain. This would be akin to going out and killing a few balrons in UO 
  so that you can finally make GM Blacksmith. Of course, there are no trade skills 
  in AC yet; those are Promised For Later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The magic system looks hideously 
  complex and I hadn't even touched it yet. Basically, from what I read, you can 
  build your own spells, and their expense and effectiveness depend on what other 
  player mages are doing with their spells. Raph Koster would love this magic 
  system. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet, though.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The coolest part of the game is the 
  guild/fealty system. Basically, you can recruit other players to be your vassals 
  and they earn experience for you, even while you're offline. So if you want 
  to just be a full time Pimp Lord and can convince 16 other people to do your 
  heavy lifting for you, the game can do that. You can even construct your own 
  medieval version of the pyramid scheme, where your vassals can recruit <i>their 
  </i>vassals and everyone kicks in a little to the Man aka you. This is going 
  to make guildmasters very, very happy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall - it's a very complex game 
  system, more so than UO and definitely more so than EQ. Not for beginners, I'd 
  wager. However, the folks at Turbine have been taking notes, and AC does deliver 
  the best of both worlds. If they can carry it off and fix a couple of key things 
  (such as newbie accessibility, graphics and noncombat skills), when the game 
  launches you will see me there full time.</font></p>

  5:30 PM </i><b>NOTE TO SELF - DO NOT SPEND SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS OF MY LIFE 
  CREATING A USELESS CHARACTER</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some classes in EQ are considered 
  broken because they cannot be Tank Mages. This includes Warriors, who actually 
  have a valid beef, since at higher levels they fight no better than Rangers 
  and Paladins who have Other Neat Things, and Rogues. My first EQ character was 
  a rogue; I figured out rapidly that it was a pretty futile exercise. <a href="http://boards.vaultnetwork.com/showpost.pl?Board=veeshan&amp;Number=476&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5">It 
  took this guy a lot longer.</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the way, one of the few people 
  you hear bitching about their classes are Shamen. This is of course, because 
  I play a Shaman, and everyone wants, subconsciously, to be as cool as I.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Fed up with this Housing shortage 
    after hearing horror stories from friends who have been waiting as long as 
    a YEAR to place a castle they purchased and slapped in the face by the account 
    of an Origin employee who was selling Housing to the higest bidder on Ebay, 
    I decided to organize a mini Revolt. I decided to start a one man war on Ultima 
    Online, encouraging people to quit the game and play Sony's Everquest. But, 
    alas... all is not lost. I contacted Origin about this housing problem and 
    they have been very supportive. "Give us 30 days to fix the problem, they 
    asked." This is your thirty day warning, OSI. Today is July 5th... you have 
    until August 5th to solve this problem. Fix the housing problem NOW while 
    you still can. I know I'm just one user, but I think I represent a great deal 
    of unhappy people. Like everyone else, I vote with my pocketbook and I'll 
    be packing up my characters and moving to the world of Norrath soon and leaving 
    the Ultima Online Ghost Town forever. </i></font></p>

    *South Park* is another movie straight from the smoking pits of Hell. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*South Park* is an *incredibly 
    dangerous* movie for those who do not understand or are developing an understanding 
    of the Gospel ....... INCREDIBLY dangerous. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Satan is portrayed as the homosexual 
    lover of Saddam Hussein and is portrayed as a sensitive, loving and caring 
    being. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Angels were portrayed as females 
    - nude, very nude. God was called many vulgar and hateful names. Satan was 
    glorified. Jesus was equated with sexual anatomy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Body parts dripping with blood 
    were ripped from a child by a surgeon who expressed shallow concern. The dead 
    child was then seen with an exploded chest. The dead child, after being rejected 
    from Heaven (by nude female angels) and cast into Hell, was then presented 
    as a ghost trying to influence the other kids. Male chorus line dancers wore 
    pink bikini briefs. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are but a very few of the 
    examples of ignominy in this celluloid developed in the fiery pits of Hell. 
    And the kids in the audience loved it, almost as much as the adults with them. 
    May God have mercy on us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note that the cut of the movie 
    I saw did not include the sodomy between Satan and Hussein or I missed it 
    while annotating other ignominy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Canadians are vilified.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People laughed at the obscene jokes, 
    gave obscene finger gestures to each other, and otherwise seemed to enjoy 
    this blasphemous, immoral, evil movie.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The movie takes literally Marxist 
    Professor Herbert Marcuse's statement that language is a weapon of the revolution, 
    and the goal of the revolution is to tear down any semblance of morality, 
    i.e., Christianity and the Bible. As Marx said, prostitutes are better than 
    wives (whom he ridicules), families are bad and religion is the opiate of 
    the people. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The future of our society looks

  TALK ABOUT EQ, BAY-BEE</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK, new topic. Sorry for all of you 
  who wrote me wanting to know more dirt about UO GMs, but hey - the state their 
  rep is in you can pretty much make up anything short of statuatory rape and 
  the rumor's flying that they're guilty of it. So fill in the blanks your own 
  bad self.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new, really, really high level 
  plane just opened up in EQ. The Plane of Fear ...and I bet <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com/">he's</a> 
  excited he has his own plane of existence now! And guess who was the first to 
  explore in that new land... that's right, the <a href="http://www.firesofheaven.org/">Fires 
  of Heaven</a> guild. <a href="http://www.firesofheaven.org/foh/bbs/messages/763.html">Here's 
  some pics</a> from their field trip.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is, of course, the same guild 
  that recently <a href="http://www.firesofheaven.org/foh/features/TheSlayingofLadyVox-Veeshan06-16-99.htm">killed 
  Lady Vox</a>, the most powerful monster in the game. Of course, it didn't hurt 
  that <a href="http://www.eqvault.com/archive/19990613.shtml#1837">they had Aradune 
  tanking for them</a>. You know, the designer of the game? But that's OK, because 
  as he said, he really wasn't all that powerful, in the grand scheme of things. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rumor had it they had a GM intervene 
  for them in getting one of their members to level 50 first. Just so they could 
  playtest new things, you understand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My own opinion - anyone who is already 
  level 50 in EQ seriously needs to go out and look at the pretty flowers outside 
  once in a while. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And moving right along from the somewhat 
  fishy to the truly fucking pathetic, <a href="http://www.bluesalt.com/skillbot.htm">we 
  have this</a>. "And they LAUGHED at me at the Institute...!"</font></p>
