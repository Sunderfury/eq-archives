Strap yourselves in as we dig deeper into the "Big Book of Raph" and look at some more things he brought to the table.<br><br>Before we begin though, Raph was kind enough to point out a mistake in the first part of this little essay.  The law "Looking at what parts of your game players tend to automate is a good way to determine which parts of the game are tedious and/or not fun." was indeed added *after* his experience with UO.  As he stated <font color="#00CC00">"The Laws are a living document that has been evolving since before UO shipped to well after."</font> How would he do things today?  Well, I guess we'll have to wait untill we find out his mysterious next project...which I can only assume is an Massivly Multiplayer Online version of Frogger unless someone on the inside is willing to tell me different.<br><br>Anyways, on with Raphs rules...nd how the big three stack up to 'em.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">If you write a static story (or indeed include any static element) in your game, everyone in the world will know how it ends in a matter of days. Mathematically, it is not possible for a design team to create stories fast enough to supply everyone playing. This is the traditional approach to this sort of game nonetheless. You can try a sim-style game which doesn't supply stories but instead supplies freedom to make them. This is a lot harder and arguably has never been done successfully.</font><br><br><b>UO and EQ:</b> Let us accept for the minute this is true.  Does this mean that it's not even worth trying?  Well, EQ and UO would have you believe this is true.  We've seen some good steps recently by UO to buck the trend, but no matter how many uncorruptable seers you have, we're still on our own when it comes to enterntaining ourselves.   Is this law true though?  Well, AC doesn't think so....<br><br><b>AC:</b> They think different.  They think they can do it. Of course there are people who believe you can levitate.  Those people wind up hopping up and down on their ass.  AC seems bent on giving it the old college try.  Let's wait untill after they hurt their ass before we pass judgement.<br><br>It's possible that technology and really good bots will be able to provide players, someday, with stories.  Not today though.  The much touted quest engine in EQ turned out to be nothing more than a good way for folks to camp for l33t goodies.  If a quest engine ever went into UO, expect more of the same.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">The expectations are higher than of similar actions in the real world. For example: players will expect all labor to result in profit; they will expect life to be fair; they will expect to be protected from aggression before the fact, and not just to seek redress after the fact; they will expect problems to be resolved quickly; they will expect that their integrity will be assumed to be beyond reproach; in other words, they will expect too much, and you will not be able to supply it all. The trick is to manage the expectations</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> Just get players used to the response of "I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do to help you." and you're problem is solved.  Actually, that's just harsh and more than a bit unfair...although for a monent I caught Myschef nodding her head.  Raph was talking about more than player grievences.  He was talkiung about the whole big picture.  A carpenter expects that his hour of work will wield the same profit as the hours work of a blacksmith...and in a virtual world, why not?  In the arena of "fairness" in skills UO has had it's sucess and it's faliures.  UO has also paid attention to the grivences of all groups.  They haven't done too badly.  We can tell because everyone in UO thinks the dev team is out to get them.  A fair compromise is where both sides walk away from the table unhappy.  In regards to resolving complaints...well, it's a long road ahead to repair the damage.  Will faith be restored in the GM program?  We'll see...we'll see.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> If EQ has a greater flaw than security, it would be in the intrest of "fairness."  From a combat system that is unfair to all except Rangers to a blatant disregard to the complaints of the community, EQ has it all.  In EQ you are not rewarded for any labor except camping.  The trade skills are little more than ways to spend money wihtout reward.  Even in upholding the rules, the one thing that can be said about EQ GMs is that they make UO look good.<br><br><b>AC:</b> The new kid on the block allways has it the easiest.  EQ was once reknowned for listening to the players and for good support.  Will life in AC be "fair" for the players?  Ask me in a few months.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">Online game economies are hard.  A faucet->drain economy is one where you spawn new stuff, let it pool in the "sink" that is the game, and then have a concomitant drain. Players will hate having this drain, but if you do not enforce ongoing expenditures, you will have Monty Haul syndrome, infinite accumulation of wealth, overall rise in the "standard of living" an capabilities of the average player, and thus unbalance in the game design and poor game longevity.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> An online economy might be hard, but you can't fault UO for trying.  Of all the three, only UO has come close.  From rare items like paintings, to housing, to replacing lost or decayed items, "too much money" is a problem a player won't face in UO for a good long time.  In UO there is a reason for blacksmiths to continue making items, there is a reason for an alchemist to grind away, there's even a role for the tailor and the fisherman.  There are sites on the internet and in front of banks that see as much acticity as any middle east bazzar.  Perfect?  Of course not.  The final drain needs to be established.  Player titles?  In city housing?  Items rare and desirable sold only by NPCs?  The ideas are there.  <br><br><b>EQ:</b> For those who doubt Raph on this subject, boot up EQ.  Your items never decay, your body is allways recovered, and what do you do after you've camped every spawn point?  Well, give it to some newbie to twink 'em up.  What the hell, it's only stuff, right?  The minimal trade skills EQ has are seldom used.  Why?  Well, a blacksmith has no need for money and where will he sell his things once his customers all have magic swords of whoop ass?<br><br><b>AC:</b> They can't even plead ignorance on this one.  They had years to figure it out.  Still, like EQ, they overlooked this one important facet of what makes a virtual world as opposed to a first person whooter with swords.  In any world, no matter how simple, there is an economy.  In a world where there's no place to put your things, nothing to spend money on, and an allegience system that encourages twinking, you are left with a world devoid of one of the most important aspects of human society.  For a group that got so many things right, they got this one wrong.....horribly, horribly wrong.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">Ownership is key.  You have to give players a sense of ownership in the game. This is what will make them stay--it is a "barrier to departure." Social bonds are not enough, because good social bonds extend outside the game. Instead, it is context. If they can build their own buildings, build a character, own possessions, hold down a job, feel a sense of responsibility to something that cannot be removed from the game--then you have ownership.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> So god damn important.  Let's say a game was released tomorrow that was every bit as good as UO.  Would I leave UO?  Eventually, but it's going to be a strugle.  It's not just the houses, but the little things.  It's the potted plant, it's the paintings on my wall, it's the ability to make a sword with my name on it.  I worked for those things.  I earned them.  They're mine.  They don't belong to my guild, they don't belong to the game, they are mine.  Rationally I know that it's nothing more than a series of 0s and 1s floating out there in cyberspace....but in my heart that horse belongs to me.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> Your clothes are given to you, you have no home.  The things you posses are things you've taken off the dead bodies of critters.  Sounds like a third world nation to me, and seeing people sit out in the rain in the middle of the desert renforces that.  Somedays I think I see Sally Struthers in the distance ready to plead for relief...and then I realize it's just an orc spawn.<br><br><b>AC:</b> Even if housing goes in, it's going to be guild housing.  You will live with your collective, the only things you own are the things that your collective has given you to twink you up.  As in EQ, the little things are mising.  Owning a horse.  Owning a new suit of clothes.  Having a potted plant to call your own.  If EQ is a third world nation, AC is going to be like an apartment building in Moscow.  Then again, perhaps not...still, they haven't laid the groundwork down yet and you have to wonder if it's too late.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">If your game is narrow, it will fail.  Your game design must be expansive. Even the coolest game mechanic becomes tiresome after a time. You have to supply alternate ways of playing, or alternate ways of experiencing the world. Otherwise, the players will go to another world where they can have new experiences. This means new additions, or better yet, completely different subgames embedded in the actual game.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> I wonder sometimes why this damn game is still on my hardrive.  Ownership was one factor, variety is the other.  When I've gotten sick of the game, within a week or two there will be something else to grab my attention.  I'm not talking about add ons like the second age either.  It's the richness of possible activities.  I've gone from being a warrior to running a shop.  For over a month or two I was obsessed with drawing in customers, selling them goods, helping them when they needed help.  I've been part of movements to form anti-pk guilds.  I've taken part in stories, I've gone on little holy quests at the shrines, I've lived as nothing more than a tradesperson.  There has allways been something.  Perhaps there will be a game that will offer as wide a variety of activities as UO...but I haven't sen it yet.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> There are level 50 characters in Norrath right now wondering why the joy has gone out of the game for them.  You've just killed the meanest monster on the planet...what are you going to do now?  Well, stare at half naked elf chicks I guess.<br><br><b>AC:</b> Active PvP combat on Darktide might help.  We'll see.  I do know that there are less things to do in AC than in UO as far as variety goes.  Will that hurt AC?  You betcha.  Fataly? Well...as with many of these examples, we'll just have to see.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">The quality of roleplaying is inversely proportional to the number of people playing.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> Does Raph sound overly cynical when he says that?  Well, UO is living breathing proof that he's right.  You know, unless you happen to consider "Beavis and Butthead go to Sossaria" to be roleplaying.  The level of roleplaying runs the gambit in UO, from nonexistant to "look, I'm an elf...and somebody killed my parents".  Is this a bad thing?  Not entirely...as I'll get to in a sec.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> Oddly enough there does seem to be roleplaying going on here.  Of course everyone who does roleplay plays a character than runs around, kills rats, sits down, and then kills more rats, but at least it's a defined role.  Besides, at least in EQ one can look like an Elf.  People who roleplay elves in UO and EQ remind me of trekkies.  I mention that only because there aren't enough people who try to kill me on Sonoma.<br><br><b>AC:</b> Like UO we see a wide spectrum represented.  The allegience system, when not used as a pyramid scheme, helps matters some.  Still, there is less roleplaying currently.  Will people start to once they figure out what the hell The Empyrean is?  We'll have to wait and see.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">A roleplay-mandated world is essentially going to have to be a fascist state. Whether or not this accords with your goals in making such a world is a decision you yourself will have to make.</font><br><br>Told you I would get to why lack of roleplaying might not be too bad a thing.  One mans roleplayer is another mans kewlio.  What's the difference between playing "Drow elf seeking vengence for the murder of his parents" and "Fat Tony, mafia don comes to Sossaria"?  In UO both would be out of place...well, perhaps Fat Tony wouldn't.  There is, afterall, supposed to be spillover between our Earth and Sossaria, but don't let the roleplayers that...they might not be able to fight, but they have numbers.  They seem to travel in packs.  The question boils down to "who makes the judgement call?".  The name tyranny in EQ is just one example.  Another is the newbie in EQ who has the sheer unmitigated gall to ask a question about game mechanics without putting "ooc" in front of it.  Bastard.  Thank god there are plenty of folks in EQ to chastise the jerk.  Asking a question.  the nerve!<br><br>You get the point though.  Look, I can sympathize with the roleplayers.  That's what they do in the game, and it's only natural they would want that fiction maintained...it just ain't going to happen, kids.<br><br>Whew.  That was a bunch of stuff.  We're not done yet.  Before we end our little romp through the mind of Raph Koster, there's one more I want to cover.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">The longer your game runs, the less often you get kudos for your efforts.</font><br><br>Quite so.  I've gotten e-mail from some of you thanking me for reminding them of Raph did for our strange little hobby.  A very nice change from the "Raph is the devil" posts we still see from time to time.  I would, however, recomend you mail <a href="mailto:rkoster@origin.ea.com">raph koster</a> those kind words instead of me...I mean the guy must be getting lonley working in mystery all the time.  Send him your words and some nice goat porn why dontcha?<br><br>Raph had a great deal to say.  That's why next we'll take a look at what the next generation of games needs to know...and why they won't listen.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000028.html">Got something to say?
