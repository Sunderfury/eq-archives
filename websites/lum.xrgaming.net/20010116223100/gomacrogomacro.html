    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You all 

      know what happened today. If you don't, for god's sake get up from your 

      damn computer for five minutes. Someone will probably tell you.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am in 

      shock. I have a stepdaughter who is in high school. Her first response was 

      &quot;You don't understand, this could SO happen here. Security at school 

      is a joke.&quot; </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The world 

      is getting worse. When I was in highschool all of 15 years ago, people would 

      excrete concrete products for even bringing a gun to school. Now we've got 

      kids who can't even buy smokes legally with goddamned assault rifles and 

      pipe bombs.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this 

      writing, it looked like this month's installment of Hell on earth was perpertrated 

      by a clique of Goths who were pissy because the jocks got all the cool shit. 

      And apparently they were racist too. Wonderful. I so love humans.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know 

      a lot of you reading this are hardcore PKs. I've been in a PK guild myself, 

      so I'm not preaching to you from some faroff ivory tower. I want you to 

      ask yourself, is there even any CHANCE that you are capable of pulling the 

      crap that those two meatbags that resigned from humanity pulled today. Any 

      chance at all. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm not 

      calling you sick or perverted or twisted for liking to PK online. I'm just 

      calling for a quick reality check. Make sure that you aren't being desensitized 

      by the violence we live in today, a violence mirrored by the music we listen 

      to, the movies we watch, and the games we play.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's not 

      the guns fault, it's not the schools fault, its not even the parents fault. 

      It's our fault, society's fault. And the only way out is for each and every 

      one of to own this, and commit to, in however microscopic a fashion, fixing 

      it.</font></p>

        have much time on my hands. I'm not sure if your lack of intelligence 

        disallows you from seeing such things as your article might suggest. Oh 

        and by the way, I'm GM in fencing, tactics, and a Master in poisoning.

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, I 

      never said that you HAD to macro. I merely said that you had to macro if 

      you didn't want to spend months and months prepping your character up to 

      the point that it was actually usable. And I'm sure there's a lot of folks 

      only into PvM that never macro. And some skills (such as Lumberjacking) 

      you can't really macro at all. </font></p>

        18 hours = 1080 minutes. Therefore I repeated peacemaking 5400 times for 

        1.1 gain. Mathematics my man, they cannot twist mathematics to their needs...</font></i></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, given 

      that the average Ultima Online fanatic is online staring at their screen 

      4 hours a day, 5 days a week (which is generous for me and most other adults 

      with lives they call their own), this means that on the shard with not only 

      the coolest name but the least restrictive skill curve, it will take you 

      somewhere around 45 weeks to make GM, assuming that you began a dedicated 

      bard with an initial skill of 50. This also does not take into account the 

      logarithmic progression of skill gain, or, in English, that it takes something 

      short of forever to gain in skill once you break 90. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So if you 

      want to be an honest bard and not one of those EvIl ExPLoITeRS, you best 

      get cracking.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since I 

      strive every day to be more like my friend &quot;Dr.&quot; TwisTer, I think 

      we should actually get the facts on how you will be totally reamed by no 

      longer macroing. If you've got hard figures on what kind of skill gain you 

      get from macroing, send it in and give us something else to be pissy and 

      grouse about!</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Read the 

      pissy rant I posted below this first, if you haven't already.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Got a few 

      emails already on this bit, and it set me to thinking.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO is a 

      virtual world. That's one of it's strengths.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And OSI 

      is the DEA.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bear with 

      me here. Macroing and third party program use is like smoking marijuana. 

      No one gets up during church and announces &quot;Yeah, I smoked a spliff 

      the other day and I still got some left, want some?&quot;, but if you had 

      a Magic Truthsaying Machine I imagine if you surveyed everyone in America 

      under 50 you'd have very few people who didn't know how to inhale.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And like 

      marijuana, most people understand that macroing, and by extenstion the use 

      of third party programs, while illicit, is also quite widespread. This isn't 

      a genie you can stuff back in the bottle. And there are quite a few things 

      more hazardous than marijuana, or macroing. Like, say, instant vendor kills. 

      Were my wife's vendors mysteriously slain? Or was it just a bug, like the 

      time she lost a chest off a boat in thin air and the GM, responding to the 

      call, said &quot;Well, I guess *it just washed off the boat!*&quot;. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But no, 

      instead of actually performing customer service the GMs in UO are more concerned 

      with tracking down and destroying recreational marijuana users -- er, unattended 

      macroers. And you know, most of the time it's because someone narced on 

      the victim in question.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I guess 

      I shouldn't be too surprised... we put up with fascism in real life, why 

      not Ultima Online. So does Lord British get a nifty silver shield from McGruff 

      the Anti-Crime Dog now?</font></p>

      100 players, 98 have macroed. Guaranteed. The game system is designed that

      and for that matter pretty much intend to relegate yourself to maybe beating 

      up the occasional ratman in between hanging out at your tavern, if you do 

      not macro, your character is inferior and will DIE. Constantly.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not to 

      mention the fact that many skills are just incredibly BORING. Mining. Anatomy. 

      Evaluate Intelligence. Fishing. Magery. The list is long and painful, those 

      are just what I personally have macroed.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OSI even 

      has macroing built into the client. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The kicker 

      is &quot;unattend macroing&quot; - aka actually going off and doing something 

      productive. Although currently it's cute to be all coy and shit and say 

      &quot;Oh, I NEVER use Banned Third Party Utilities&quot;, everyone either 

      uses UO Assist (if they're ethical) or UO Extreme (if they're a pud) or 

      UO Plugin (if they're a clueless pud). Because they allow you to actually 

      use your computer for something else (like, say, updating a web page) while 

      doing mindless makework in UO.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't 

      play UO to bash on a macro execute key all day. I play UO to engage in interaction 

      with other human beings. Your mileage may vary, I imagine, but even the

      <p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GO 

        MAKE A CHARACTER ON ABYSS</font></b></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The one 

        exception to the above rule is on the Abyss shard. That's because in Brit 

        there, there are moongates available to make an insta-Shake-n-Bake 7xGM 

        (in other words, a maxxed out character). So this is the perfect place 

        to experiment with what skills you want to work on with your real character. 

        Just ignore the rabble asking you where the fencing gate is. Note that 

        Abyss is PK happy, but hell, so are the rest of the shards so it's good 

        practice in survival. Plus, you'll find out after a while that having 

        GM Everything isn't really that different from your own sad ass character 

        on other shards. You still miss half the time. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JOIN 

        A GUILD THAT DOESN'T SUCK</font></b></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You could 

        play UO without joining a guild, but in that case you might as well play 

        Baldur's Gate - the NPCs are wittier and the graphics are better. But 

        take some care when joining a guild. Go on a few runs with them and see 

        if they all die. If they do, you probably want to join another guild. 

        This is a good chance to also see if your prospective guildmates actually 

        speak English (as opposed to Dewdish, Hiphop or Roleplayer).</font></p>

      <p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DON'T 

        TRY TO WIN</font></b></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one 

        has ever won UO except Richard Garriot. And we all know what happened 

        to <b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/thesite/0797w4/play/play733jump2_072497.html" target="_blank">HIM</a></b>. 

        Just kick back and have fun. That's how you would &quot;win&quot;, here 

        or in real life. But what do I know, I'm Lum the Sanity Challenged...</font></p>
