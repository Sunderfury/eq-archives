      removed the guilds from the game. Both were named &quot;TCM - Trench Coat 
      Mafia&quot;, one was on Baja and the other on Drachenfels. Ahh, the raw 
      power of webmastery.)</i></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On a related 
      subject, I got a <a href="youvegotgothmail.html">well written rant</a> from 
      a goth who plays UO last night, who took offense at my labelling the little 
      pusbags in Colorado that layed waste to their school &quot;goths who were 
      pissy that jocks got all the cool shit.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First off, 
      I'm wasn't saying &quot;all goths are bad&quot;. Hell, when I was in high 
      school I did my share of dyed black hair and pancake makeup, but back then 
      it was the 80's and more of a fashion statement then anything else. Now 
      it's like a whole subculture that I somehow missed. However, at the time 
      I wrote that, the mass media, always an impeccable source of correct information, 
      was saying that the two or three or twenty shooters were goths who listened 
      to the Cure one too many times and decided to end everyone else's pain too. 
      (Actually I made that last part up. To connect the Cure to Goths would have 
      required actual research. Instead they just beat on Marilyn Manson for a 
      while because he's a strange little girlyman with man breasts. When I was 
      in New York last year his album had just came out, and Interscope had purchased 
      a HUGE billboard in Times Square with this 50 foot Marilyn Manson staring 
      down at you with his nakedness. I blame that experience for the web page 
      you are now reading.)</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we're 
      going to hear for the next year or so that video games are bad for you and 
      the Internet breeds killers because one of them <a href="http://doomnation.com/afterglow/">posted 
      a DOOM wad</a> (man, you gotta love those iD guys for subtlety in naming 
      conventions) on AOL. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leaving 
      aside for the moment that if I hear AOL referred to as the Internet ONE 
      MORE TIME I may breed a killer inside of me my own damned self. And the 
      fact that these two guys were so lame that they actually bought those godawful 
      Doom &quot;fiction&quot; books.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We like 
      to blame people. Hell, look at the <a href="http://www.murderdeathkill.com/">MDK 
      banning</a>. A bunch of wastes of perfectly good air get banned for following 
      some poor roleplayer around screaming &quot;We're going to A$zZ Rap3 j00!&quot; 
      It hits the boards and immediately everyone takes sides. The PKers, who 
      spend much of their time picking on roleplayers, are frightened that OSI 
      will start banning THEIR guilds. The roleplayers, who spend much of their 
      time bitching at OSI about the roleplayers picking on them, are celebrating 
      that OSI *are* starting to ban those PK guilds.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sounds 
      kinda like high school, hmm?</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just remember, 
      as the media goes into Monica Lewinsky withdrawal and goes into full 24 
      hour ban-all-signs-of-violence-from-our-tender-little-babies mode, what 
      apparently <b>really </b>happened at Columbine High School was that two 
      kids, who had been picked on for being geeks their entire lives, finally 
      snapped. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not because 
      they played Doom too much (um, they couldn't update to Quake at some point?), 
      not because they listened to scary music, not even because they were in

      If it's singing, I have some requests...</font></p>
