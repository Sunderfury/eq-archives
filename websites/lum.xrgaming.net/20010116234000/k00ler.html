        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Siege Perilous last night, 

          GM GhostPig made an visit to the guard barracks west of Covetous to 

          check out how well the garbage chest was working. Since two of my guildmates 

          were in Macro Prison I asked him some questions. It went like this:

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(from memory not a transcript)

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GhostPig: (with really cool 

          black deer hat) Yes. We can determine if they are using a skill. Contrary 

          to what people think we do not ban for going afk...only for macroing. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then he left..probably to 

          go ban some more macroers. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before he left he dropped 

          through the floor to check on someone hidden downstairs. He ended up 

          standing on a bed...but apparently GM's can't jump on beds..which was 

          a disapointment. We were all really impressed with the falling through 

          the floor thing. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was passed this info from 

        one of the El33t S00per Seekrit UO IRC channels;</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ok after much deliberation 

          this is the final word. The first time your counselors are caught macroing 

          they will be kicked, like any other player. The second time they are 

          banned from the game. If some of you did not hear what Gabriel was saying 

          in the channel earlier let me sum up how it works. If someone is allegedly 

          macroing then the GM will come to them and try to get their attention. 

          If they are not responding then we CAN check the scripts on that character 

          as see if they are macroing. Once it is determined that they are macroing 

          then the GM will take them to what is called the Macro Room. This is 

          a spot on Bucs den. They will leave the macroer here while they write 

          the notes in our data base. When the GM is finished they will return 

          to the player and ask once more if they are present. After getting no 

          response a second time the GM will kick the player from the game.</font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is interesting in that 

        it implies (well, flat out states) that the GMs can actually find out 

        if you are using skills while AFK. This directly contradicts MANY emails 

        that I have recieved that people are being banned for the crime of hitting 

        their &quot;Hide&quot; key and going to the bathroom. You people wouldn't 

        lie to me.... would you?</font></p>

          (i.e. more than one above 80) then forget unattended macroing. they 

          have you flagged on a special checklist already and just love to pop 

          in on you from time to time. i was told this via icq and didn't believe 

          it myself, but i have 3 skills above 80 and today i was visited 4 times. 

          luckily i was just chatting on icq or practicing a skill that made no 

          noise or movement and was able to respond to him every time he came 

          up. it was on the fourth time that i asked why the hell i kept getting

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's been a <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000079.html">somewhat 

        active thread</a> (well, active for the horribly crippled and painfully 

        ugly message base here) about the Test Center and the new beta test client, 

        and the subculture of &quot;el33t&quot; Test Center folks who inhabit 

        them.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's a response from someone 

        involved in the controversy. They remain anonymous, for obvious reasons.</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I read the thread on your 

          Discussion Board about TC -- the one where J calls TC players "stuckup 

          reactionaries" -- and there is one thing you seem to be ignoring here. 

          Senith and Darwin both commented about the UO Beta Test on the EQ side 

          of Gate Traveler. (One "l," Lum. ;)) Why is that? Well, I would say 

          it's because those stuck-up reactionaries J was referring to are the 

          former TC Regs, now EQ's very own elite Test Guild and associated hangers-on 

          -- the only guild allowed on EQ's TS, with their own special authorization-only 

          board and a direct line to Verant's QA. And if you think TC is a country 

          club, you should check out TS. Although the Test Guild claims not to 

          be twinked (Well, except for that little boost to level 10 they got 

          when it was offered to everybody who happened to be on TS at the time. 

          Funny how all of them were on, isn't it?) you can apparently go from 

          level 1 to rubicite-armored level 30 (or 40 or 50 for the really lucky 

          twinks) in less time than it takes to goggle at the equipment, if you 

          know the right people. It seems to be an unfortunate characteristic 

          of test servers that some employees with too much power and too little 

          sense regard them as their private playgrounds. By the way, there are 

          no wipes on Test Server, so anything Verant hands out is yours to keep. 

          I would suggest that anybody who wasn't happy with the way Test Center 

          was handled check out Test Server. You have basically the same group 

          of people pulling the same elitist bullshit.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FYI, what's left on UO's 

          TC is for mostly just us players who were never part of the TC Regs, 

          and new people join us all the time. Many of us have been there all 

          along, you just never knew it because the Regs, well... Let's put it 

          this way. Somebody once said that Charlie Chaplain thought that everyone 

          should sit at his feet, and when they didn't he would go out and stand 

          where they were sitting. That pretty much sums up the TC Regs. Anyway, 

          things have changed drastically on Test Center. OSI rarely puts up advancement 

          gates, and then only specific gates for specific skills. It's mostly 

          for the drop-in testers from other shards since any residents testing 

          the changes that the gates target are already at or near gate levels 

          by the time the gates go up. Not only did OSI put a stop to QAs handing 

          things out, they made them go back and retrieve most of the stuff they 

          did give out last wipe. (In fact, the town criers' news late last wipe 

          was "Please do not ask QA for things.") It pretty much made the QAs' 

          lives hell, so I don't think they'll be handing things out regularly 

          again. We still get faster advancement and lots of space and spawn, 

          but then we get our characters wiped so it balances out. Oh, and "shardie" 

          isn't necessarily an insult. It's just somebody who doesn't play TC 

          regularly. Hang out in Britain, and you'll see lots of them. "Shardie 

          attitude," now that's an insult. :)</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly, about the Beta registration 

          process. TC's regular players got advance notice on GT. If that makes 

          us "l33t" so be it. But, there aren't all that many of us and 2000 spots, 

          so I don't think that we're going to preclude a whole lot of people 

          from signing up. One thing you might want note though. OSI apparently 

          had every intention of just giving us a few hours head start before 

          announcing the registration on owo.com. They haven't because the registration 

          process turned out to be a lot worse than a few tacky pages. The process 

          requested your UO account and password. Unfortunately, it wasn't secure. 

          Uh oh.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I didn't post this on your 

          discussion board for the same reason I'm not going to give you my name 

          and the hotmail e-mail addy is, obviously, a blind. I still play both 

          servers and getting on the bad side of Test Guild can be a nightmare.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the good news, here's Jeff 

        with a report from the Houston UO luncheon:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just wanted to give comment 

          on some stuff that I heard at the latest player luncheon in Houston. 

          Let me say this, there were 5 representatives from OSI that drove 3 

          hours from Austin to get to Houston to attend this. They gave their 

          little speech about how UO is still gaining members and then opened 

          it up for a Q&A session. Well after a while of people complaining about 

          housing and stat loss a buddy of mine asked GM Gabriel where the ancient 

          wyrm is on Baja. You see according to UOA it is sitting outside the 

          dungeon walls and has been like that for close to 3 months. Well he 

          looks kinda confused, and says he'll look into it. Then a minute later 

          he is on his cell phone calling OSI headquarters telling GM Josh to 

          get it fixed for us. Now that I thought was unbelievable! It seems to 

          me that pretty much all of the GM and support staff are excited about 

          Siege Perilous, they would not stop talking about it!. After the main 

          Q&A session I went to GM Gabriel and thanked him for calling and we 

          started to chat. According to him OSI now has the ability to log pretty 

          much anything. One thing he noted is that they can log how much you 

          bought a house for and how much gold you have within that house. So 

          if you all of a sudden get 2 million gold in your house they will pretty 

          much know you found a new dupe. Also one of the reasons that SP is only 

          a test now is so that they can find out where all the money making exploits 

          lie and fix then before they wipe the server and make it perm. Also 

          they did say that they will be looking VERY closely at macroing on SP. 

          That was about all the good stuff that went on, I left with a VERY good 

          impression of the OSI support staff. Oh and btw, the creator of Fluffy 

          the Pk Chicken lives here in Houston. Let me just say that the new one 

          coming out is AWESOME!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Damn, that GM Gabriel is one 

        smooth GM. I was impressed with how responsive and eager to satisfy you, 

        the player he was. Er, until I read this.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've read your site with 

          interest in the last month or so. I am emailing you because of the last 

          update on your page speaking of banning unattended macroers on Siege 

          Perilous, and the fact that I just got banned. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I posted a full account of 

          what happened on the Dev Board, although I'm not sure how long it will 

          be before the admin there decides to delete it (they love deleting posts 

          which question OSIs integrity). </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The short version is, I left 

          my computer for one minute to take a leak, and I come back and find 

          myself in macro jail. The GM (GM Gabriel) was still with me and walking 

          around me, but not speaking. Realising where I was, I said hello to 

          him, and I tried explaining that I was only gone to the toilet for a 

          minute. He was very rude to me and stated 'Did you take your keyboard 

          into the toilet with you?'. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I find this customer 'service' 

          absolutely appalling. I repeated myself and asked if you got banned 

          for going to the toilet now, and he merely said 'I will remove you from 

          the game now farewell'. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I realise that unattended 

          macroers take up a spot on a server and that others who want to actually 

          play deserve that spot more, but I was only away from the keyboard for 

          a minute, to take a freaking PISS, and now I'm banned for 48 hours. 

          This is the height of power abuse and downright rudeness and I cant 

          believe OSI let their 'GMs' get away with this crap. I was there and 

          talking to the GM, clearly at my computer, and I was still banned. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm not sure if this is of 

          any interest to you, but I thought I would let you know what happened 

          anyway. GMs on SP are now on witch hunts, not just for unattended macroers, 

          but for anyone who doesn't answer them in 3 or 4 seconds. I suppose 

          you could lose connection and be banned for not answering a GM. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've cancelled my UO account. 

          SP was fun, old school UO, but I'm not going to pay those gimps $10 

          a month to be treated like crap by someone who isn't old enough to legally 

          get laid. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lest you think Gemini is alone 

        in his misery, Gabriel and the other GMs were very busy boys and girls 

        this weekend. Among those banned this weekend were my own guildmaster. 

        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obviously, the GMs want 

        to create an atmosphere of terror and fear among the player base, so that 

        no one <i>dares</i> to macro.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leaving aside for the moment 

        the very valid point that most of you probably did not fork over your 

        credit card's recurring billing so that you could be instilled with fear 

        and terror (I'd like some fear to go, please), two things occur to me 

        reading the many emails I recieved from people who were banned; </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) There is no possible way 

        for the GMs to ban everyone who macros on the shard</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) Since the skill curve was 

        imported from a macroed-to-death shard, those who don't get caught macroing 

        will have a serious advantage against those to whom the fear-uncertainty-and-doubt 

        lesson took.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things that make you go <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=787980206/pagename=/share/ensotrack2.html/pop=1/UPC=7464470932/disc=01/track=03/source=ENSO/ra.ram">Hmmmm.</a></font></p>
