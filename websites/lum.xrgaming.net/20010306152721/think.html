        is also known as DJ Malt Refund, at least on his email.</font></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some day I'd like to take an 
        anonymous poll, and ask people what would upset them more.. having the 
        family pet die, or losing your "virtual" house and bank account to an 
        exploiter. I can almost guarantee that, if answered honestly, more people 
        would save the "house". </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What are we doing here? Why 
        do we care so much about imaginary property? Rant with me here for a second. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are people out there, 
        right now, that are making a whole lot of money off of us, and our drive 
        to "succeed" in this game. There are people on eBay that buy accounts 
        from fed up gamers, and sell them for profit to others. Thousands of dollars 
        are given to these people that do this for a living. Is this is the new 
        economy? Money for doing absolutely nothing? These people that make money.. 
        they don't "play" the game. They have only one objective in mind, and 
        it has nothing to do with trapping efreets. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These people know you are addicted 
        to Ultima Online. They know that you'll pay. So, why are we addicted? 
        Why do we play Ultima Online? Whats the point of a networked roleplaying 
        game anyhow? Is it for gold coins? Is it for virtual notoriety? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe that people play 
        this game to make a name for themselves. I mean, thats what it all comes 
        down to right? To have people respect you for all your "gp" and all your 
        "fame" and all the respect that comes with slaying the evil, bad, bad 
        guy, whether he is highlighted red or blue. You did it. You saved the 
        day. People "respect" you for that, and now they know your (code)name. 
        Why else would we have such things as notoriety and endless supplies of 
        gold coins? Could it be people want to be famous in real life, and they 
        act that out in a virtual word? Of course. Everyone is a hero in Ultima. 
        You slayed the dragon! Your armor is shining and in this world, it never 
        rains! Nothing can possibly hurt you here. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I wasn't kidding when I said 
        there are people on eBay that prey on exactly that kind of mentality, 
        and they are getting REAL gold coins. We are all being tricked, espiecally 
        by Origin. Do you honestly believe that Darwin was the only one to pull 
        a stunt like that? I'm almost positive that he isn't. GMs have the ability 
        to created ENDLESS amounts of gold coins with just a flick of the wrist, 
        and sell it in the REAL world. How tempting is that? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyway, I'm getting sidetracked. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I read the story on the kid 
        who was "addicted" to Ultima Online. I believe him. He made me think a 
        little different. It is an addiction, just like alcoholism and drug abuse, 
        only this addiction is totally un-tangible. With alcoholism, at least 
        you can hold a bottle! Ultima, virtually, takes you to another world and 
        makes you like it.. so you pay money to go back. I'm addicted to Ultima 
        Online. What am I going to do about it? Is my will strong enough to quit? 
        Isn't life too short? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For six months I've been gleefully 
        coming home from work to play Ultima Online. Six months!! Thats like .08 
        of my life, give or take. I don't want to do that! What kind of man would 
        I be then? How could I grow up and tell my children that I played a video 
        game for six months of my life!?! That is the absolute definition of Generation 
        X, the generation that accomplished nothing. What have we come to? This 
        is mass madness, you maniacs!! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How many people are just like 
        me, beyond Ultima? How many people just come home to watch TV? Is that 
        the same thing? I don't think so, cause we aren't as passionate about 
        our television, or pay 1000's of dollars for it once in a while, or value 
        it more then the family pet. We have to stop thinking that we have accoplished 
        something when we kill a wyvern. You have done NOTHING but bury yourself 
        deeper, and there will always be people waiting at eBay for you to wake 
        up from this dreamland we call Britainnia. </font></p>
