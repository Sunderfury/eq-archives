        FINAL CHAPTER</b></font> </p>

      <p>Samwise sent this in. I think we can officially declare this horse not 

        only dead, but fragmented into small tiny itsy bitsy bits.</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Jane you ignorant Slut,</p>

        <p>I understand your love for Ultima Lore. I remember spending hours on 

          end playing The older Ultima games. There is a nostalgic high you can 

          still get looking through those old manuals. But buddy,...Ultima Lore 

          was directly RIPPED from Tolkein and Gygaxx, it's not a surprise that 

          players who want to roleplay or are serious RPG players head directly 

          to the source. </p>

        <p>Remember Bobbits? I mean everything Garriot's ever done was ripped 

          from the Lord of the Rings and from Dungeons and Dragons. There IS no 

          Ultima Lore, it's all Tolkein/Gygaxx lore revisted. </p>

        <p>And as for the name Samwise. I've never read the Lord of The Rings 

          (stopped at the hobbit). When I was picking a name for my new bard character, 

          I looked up a website on fantasy names and that one stuck out so I used 

          it. After the strip came out people started mentioning to me where the 

          name actually came from. Oh well. So far everyone from my friends to 

          the people at MPOG say it's not so bad to hang onto the name. Perhaps 

          the Tolkein estate won't feel the need to sue. </p>

        <p>And Lum..take down that poll. I'm gonna lose. And even if I won, it 

          wouldn't be right becasue Lady MOI could kick our asses easy. In fact...I 

          need a good spanking. (hint hint). </p>

            the clever pun there) finger squarely on my button but this deliberate

        </blockquote>

        <p>First off, I don't snipe. I carpet bomb. Yeah, whatever. That e-mail 

          was meant to be to you (Lum), but as I didn't specify that, I hold myself 

          responsible. This one, however, is as public as you care to air it :) 

        </p>

        <p>It's not about hating Catholics. Not being a member of a majoritarian 

          religion of any sort, I know all about religious hate. My wanting to 

          keep contemporary religion out of UO does not constitute a &quot;declaration 

          of hate&quot;. </p>

        <p>What it does consititute is a desire for Ultima Online to respect the 

          Ultima tradition and for the players to at least give the scenario a 

          chance before importing out-of-context things (contemporary religion, 

          AD&amp;D classes, Forgotten Realms races, sci-fi weapondry, gangsta attitude, 

          etc). </p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p><i>I can roleplay someone who recognizes a catholic holiday. Don't 

            worry Delusion..I've never macroed a Catholic Holiday unattended. 

            </i></p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>And I've never macroed sheep herding. What's your point? Sure, you 

          &quot;can&quot; role-play some sort of disjointed Britannian Catholicism, you 

          &quot;can&quot; role-play a drow, you &quot;can&quot; role-play a gangsta, you &quot;can&quot; role-play 

          Mr. Whipple from the old Charmin commercials if you want. Ultima Online 

          doesn't &quot;feel&quot; like an Ultima a lot of times. Sure, OSI has some responsibility 

          in this, from creating Leprechauns, Santas, katanas, and not doing some 

          basic continuity checking in the Ultima history as given in the core 

          series. However, the players have a lot to do with it, too. It's fairly 

          difficult to immerse yourself in a fantasy-role-playing experience and 

          understand the rich textures of the scenario when you have 1,000 Raistlins 

          (2,500 if you include the variant spellings), 17 Redrums, 2008 Gandalfs, 

          and 10,000 pack llamas named &quot;a&quot;. </p>

        <p>I'm not sure why Samwise feels the need to &quot;deal&quot; with me. I hope, 

          in my heart of hearts, that his ego is not so inflated that he actually 

          thought I was even thinking of him when I wrote you (Lum) that e-mail. 

          Considering, as I said before, that public distribution wasn't my intent, 

          that conclusion would simply reek of hubris. </p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p><i>The hypocrisy here is blatantly apparant and all I can say is 

            that I have a new reason to fear you now BESIDES your screenshot &quot;art&quot; 

            </i> </p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>You're the one who calls it art. I generally refer to it as satire, 

          and yes, the UO community is well aware of your feelings on this matter. 

          For someone who's supposed to be so creative, and who's so prone to 

          bashing the creativity of others, I find it mildly humorous that you 

          would take your persona from a Tolkien character. However, as you're 

          one who thinks role-playing contemporary Earth religion in UO is such 

          a hot idea, I don't expect you to understand the concept of context. 

          Bring on the ninjas, bring on the borg, bring on the dwarves. </p>

        <p>Maybe in a few weeks we can talk the UO developers into approving some 

          US flag art and we can celebrate Independence Day in-game. Perhaps that 

          would put a final nail in the coffin wherein which my desire for a Britannia 

          that seems like Britannia instead of Krynn meets East Compton lies. 

        </p>

        <p>And maybe someone will write a sequel to the Tolkien series where Jedi 

          Knights teach hobbits proper use of AK-47s in order to fend off a Tribble 

          invasion. </p>

        banned! Why How Richard &quot;Lord British&quot; Garriot could be logging on once 

        a week and NEVER BE SEEN! It all fits! </p>

      <p><b><i>WARNING! READING THE FOLLOWING COULD BE CONSIDERED A THOUGHCRIME

      <p>Here's the deal. Embarrased when he found out Ultima V parties were keeping 

        him up all night with poison spells so he could be available to cure them, 

        and mortified when he was turned into a pop-tart during a UO beta test 

        appearance, Lord British tends to avoid crowds when he plays (at least, 

        but not less than!) once a week. So, when he's not taking GM calls (&quot;Lord 

        British found my boat!&quot;), he drinks a couple bottles of cough syrup for 

        courage, logs on invisible and walks around until he finds a single person 

        sitting in a house that he can chat with.</p>

      <p>After the first couple months, the dev team taught him what a vendor 

        was and now he actually only talks to players. Unfortunately, since he 

        goes to low-population houses instead of crossroads or bank tops, he rarely 

        finds people actually playing. And since he's logging on during his lunch 

        hour(s) the people that ARE on are not REALLY on - they're unattended 

        macroing while they are at their jobs or getting beat up by the jocks 

        at their junior high school. Here's a typical conversation: </p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>Lord British: Greetings, loyal citizen! How art thou faring under my 

          benevolent rule? </p>

        <p>a$$rApUr: You're the best llama I've ever seen! </p>

        <p>Lord British: What a clever joke, oh strangely-named one! But I see 

          you DO have a llama behind those chests over there. </p>

        <p>a$$rApUr: I've always wanted a llama like you... </p>

        <p>Llama: Baa.</p>

        <p>Lord British: You mean you've always wanted a ruler like the kind Lord 

          British? How nice! Be sure and tell all your friends in IRC how great 

          I am! </p>

        <p>a$$rApUr: I'll never hurt you, llama. </p>

        <p>Lord British: So, are my GMs taking good care of you? And can I ask 

          why there are a half dozen polar bears in that room over there? Is this 

          some game bug they should know about? </p>

        <p>Llama: Baa.</p>

        <p>a$$rApUr: You're the best llama I've ever seen! </p>

        <p>Lord British: What? Make sense, you've already said that! Is this how 

          you treat the creator of your world? </p>

        <p>A$$rApUr: I've always wanted a llama like you! </p>

        <p>Lord British: That's it! RESPECT MY AUTHORI-TIE! Lord British does 

          NOT find this amusing! </p>

      <p>Eventually, I'm sure, someone explained about helper programs and unattended 

        macroing to Richard and he hit the fucking ceiling of his D&amp;D castle (&quot;Now 

        with more moat monsters!&quot;). They probably also told him what &quot;a$$rApUr&quot; 

        means. And that explains why he's never been seen on a server, why the 

        staff is cracking down on hate crime (Don't bring your hate crimes here, 

        narc! HATE CRIME!) and unattended macroing, and why about 50 people's 

        monthly fees are going to provide relaxing massages once a week to keep 

        veins from bursting in Richard's temples. </p>

      <p>In case you lost any sleep over what DSM meant, the beans were spilled 

        in our message base <a href="http://lum.webtoys.net/msg/index.cgi?read=121" target="_blank">here</a> 

        and <a href="http://lum.webtoys.net/msg/index.cgi?read=122" target="_blank">here</a>. 

        You can then let the DSM herself know <a href="mailto:ctaylor@origin.ea.com?Subject=That crackhead Lum is saying nasty things about you again! Now that I told you, will you be my friend...">here</a>.</p>

      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><i>05/04/99 10:00 AM </i><b>RANDOM NOTES </b></font></p>

      <p>Don't expect too many updates today, work is keeping me busy and <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html" target="_blank">Dr 

        TwisTer declared UO dead</a>. I played EQ some more last night, mainly 

        because a few of my friends are hooked into it now. It was actually more 

        laggy than UO (possibly because I was playing on a busy server). Bleah. 

        Maybe someday 989 will actually cancel my account like I asked?</p>

      <p>Falcon of CSC posted his log of the recent Austin OSI Throwdown <a href="http://lonestar.texas.net/~fragmor/UOLunch599.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 

        His recollections are more detailed than mine; then again he was sober.</p>

      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><i>05/03/99 7:00 PM </i><b>OSI CONFIRMS THAT YOU 

        CAN BE BANNED FOR THE THOUGHTCRIME OF YOUR FRIENDS</b></font></p>

      <p>Since I quit treating LadyMOI as a human being and made cruel nicknames 

        that quickly circulated through the Net, the Ministry of Information updates 

        have ground to a screeching halt. (Well, I never got any actual <i>news</i> 

        updates, nor would I want any since that would imply I would have to be 

        like, responsible and report them and stuff. But I'm on a roll, so shaddap.) 

        So I found on Stratics that owo.com updated their site (no one reads owo.com 

        unless prompted, no matter HOW often it's updated. It's just the law.) 

        and has a line that could possibly be related to some recent controversy...</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>Things you could be banned for include, but are not limited to: </p>

      </blockquote>

      <ul>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remaining in a 

          guild that actively engages in violations of the Terms of Service Agreement 

          or the Rules of Conduct </font> 

          <p>This last point may be perceived as somewhat harsh, but it is clearly 

            stated in the Rules of Conduct that you may not organize any guilds 

            or groups that are based on, or espouse, any racist, sexist, anti-religious, 

            anti-ethnic, anti-gay, or other hate-mongering philosophy. By remaining 

            in a group that engages in this type of activity, you subject yourself 

            to the possibility of a group punishment. </p>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>So, um, don't be in a guild with bad stupid or politically incorrect 

        people or you might be banned. Also, I'm kind of wondering where &quot;A$$rapInG&quot; 

        falls under... it's not racist or sexist, and doesn't address any particular 

        ethnic group. I guess it could be considered hate mongering, but some 

        people LIKE... um, I'm going to go throw up now.</p>

      <p>Since my philosophy is always to let other people do the heavy lifting 

        for me whenever possible, I have no qualms about devoting entire long 

        updates to conversations better spent in email. With that, one blissfully 

        anonymous writer informs me:</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Aw man, don't do this to me! Not only is it insulting and demeaning to 

        women, it's highly likely that the daily Ministry of Information briefings 

        will cease! Plus, I'm pretty sure she's married, and her husband might 

        beat me up or something. But if you MUST know, here's some clues;</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><i>Hi there - I've been reading your rants page ever since Twister 

          put your link on his page and now I tend to frequent your page much 

          more, um, frequently than Twisty's. Anyhow, I recently clicked on your 

          link to a much cooler rants page and within a minute located this wonderful 

          statement: </i></p>

        <blockquote> 

          <p><i>Soccer moms tend to be undereducated, irrational women whose entire 

            lives revolve around their children. Logic dictates they should not 

            allowed anywhere near a voting booth, but since their numbers are 

            increasing, our elected officials, who care more about staying in 

            office than bettering the nation, continue to create increasingly 

            ridiculous laws to placate them. </i></p>

        </blockquote>

        <p><i>Now, I'm no soccer mom, (I'm 17/m, your typical snert) but this 

          comment and other similar rants on this page strike me as closed minded 

          almost to the point of being illogical. And yet you link to it... *eyes 

          you warily* Love your posts, Mad one, but that link is crap. </i></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>OK. Just because something is linked under &quot;much cooler rants page&quot; 

        does not mean I agree with the views expressed therein. In fact if you 

        follow <a href="http://bitch.shutdown.com/" target="_blank">that link</a> 

        and read the site, you find that this young woman has apparently devoted 

        much of her life to infiltrating and mocking the various web sites, message 

        boards and mailing lists of unwed teenage mothers so she can make fun 

        of them. Scarily obssessive, but funny. I like funny. And on the Internet 

        no one can track you down and boil bunnies in your pressure cooker.</p>
