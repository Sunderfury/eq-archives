<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, Ultima Online is done.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm certain we'll see new features 
  and whatnot in the future (there's a whole team of people who need to remain 
  gainfully employed, after all), but after three years of trying almost everything 
  and anything to &quot;fix&quot; UO's release... it's fixed. UO is a finished 
  product. You can play now.</font></p>

      <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="younglum.jpg" width="203" height="135"><br>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what caused this epiphany? Some 
  very basic, very simple design decisions that should have been made long ago, 
  that go a long way towards repairing the damage that three years of misguided 
  efforts and outright neglect have caused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First off, there's a PK switch now. 
  Oh, it's called something different, and is probably the most controversial 
  part of UO:R among its current playerbase, but the simple fact is that if you 
  so choose, you will never be killed by another player. Ever. It's a choice Everquest 
  and Asheron's Call had no problem giving their users; and it's a choice that 
  the developers of Ultima Online have been drug to, kicking and screaming the 
  entire way. But it's there now, and it works.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't like PK switches? Neither do 
  I. The key word here is &quot;choice&quot;. Every server in UO has been exactly 
  doubled in size, with two basically identical worlds (&quot;Felucca&quot; and 
  &quot;Trammel&quot; in the game fiction, &quot;Teenage Wasteland&quot; and &quot;Carebear 
  Land&quot; for short). One world has a prohibition against attacking other players, 
  one world doesn't. The new PK- land is also ready and waiting for colonization 
  - the target of every player being able to own virtual property is feasible 
  now. Switching between the two isn't trivial, but is possible. It is possible, 
  in fact recommended, to train a new character in the PK- side of the world and 
  then, once at an appropriate level of skll, graduate to the PK+ side. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That skill advancement, by the way, 
  has been significantly redone. In pursuit of two objectives - making skill gain 
  accessible to the casual player and removing the incentive to &quot;macro&quot; 
  your character while not actually playing - building a character in Ultima Online 
  is so much less tedious now it's enough to make a veteran of earlier UO systems 
  weep. Every player has a &quot;burst hour&quot;, the first hour of every day 
  they play, where skill gain is greatly accelerated. Characters can still gain 
  skills afterwards, but at normal, slower rates. Combined with the decoupling 
  of skill gain difficulty from the number of people using a skill (a truly bizarre 
  design that assumed that, given many blacksmiths in the world, blacksmithy would 
  become much more difficult for some reason) this gives players the freedom to 
  quickly assume their desired role in the world. Many UO veterans complain that 
  this somehow cheapens their accomplishment - &quot;It took me six months of 
  painful macroing, monotonous clicking, and carpal-tunnel syndrome to become 
  a grandmaster smith and it only took this newbie two weeks of enjoying himself!&quot; 
  - but the simple fact of the matter is that UO as a game really only matures 
  when its characters do. There is nothing inherently fun about being a weak pushover. 
  Massive kudos to the UO dev team for recognizing that UO is in fact a multiplayer 
  game and the fun of the game is in interacting with those players, not just 
  in building a character. Another welcome, welcome feature introduces &quot;skill 
  locks&quot;, or the ability to designate which skills to gain or lose skill 
  in. A fiction-breaking device? Sure. But in a game where most of the player 
  skill involves choosing from a limited skill point pool to develop skill in, 
  absolutely crucial.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much work has also been done in making 
  the game accessible to new characters. On the PK- side, the city of Occlo has 
  been repurposed into the newbie-friendly city of Haven. After going through 
  an exhaustive tutorial explaining how to perform such basic functions as opening 
  doors, eating bananas and putting on a hat, new players are sent to Haven, where 
  they are automatically paired with a Companion, a volunteer that guides the 
  new player through the UO game system. (There are also supposedly quests for 
  new players that help teach them how to do various trade skills and combat tasks, 
  but they weren't in place or were broken during my visit.) After up to a month 
  of nest-egg building, they then can be sent via gate to the other cities of 
  the PK- lands (and presumably the PK+ world as well, eventually.) Although the 
  UO volunteer program has been liberally laced with problems and scandal, the 
  Companion system works well, and new players should have a smooth transition 
  into veteran status.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once a player reaches that veteran 
  status, most of them will probably want to beat up other players at some point. 
  On the Player vs Player side, the combat system has undergone some radical revisions 
  as well. It's too early to judge their impact (although, as always, the <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cgi/cob/devboard.cgi?view">unofficial 
  Dev Board</a> is full of thousands of folks who disagree that it's too early) 
  the intent is obviously to break the Tank Mage mold of character design. Players 
  can be nimble fencers that stun opponents, or physically weak mages, or, if 
  they are so inclined, the Tank Mage archetype still works as well. <a href="http://uopg.uoguilds.com/">UO 
  Powergamers</a> is doing the yeoman work of actually determining what works 
  and what doesn't, and those looking at PvP would be well served to visit. Call 
  it <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/">Stratics</a> For A New Generation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another new feature of UO:R is an 
  upgrade of the monster AI, from &quot;<a href="http://www.outofcharacter.com/shorts/deamon_1.html">Help, 
  I'm trapped behind these little twigs</a>&quot; to &quot;I'm gonna kick your 
  ass and feed it to your momma&quot; status. Monsters in UO aren't ridiculous 
  pushovers any more, but now will actually *gasp* cooperate and cure each other 
  and basically be somewhat more of a challenge. Although there are some &quot;cheese 
  areas&quot; with easily harvestable loot, the wilderness of UO is crawling with 
  things waiting to target your little icon. Veterans of UO may remember that 
  one reason spawn used to be rare was that it would pop up in places like mountain 
  tops, oceans, and trapped within player houses. All of these have been fixed; 
  now if you want to find monsters you don't have far to look any more. Monster 
  bashing in UO is still an inferior experience to games like Everquest and Asheron's 
  Call which basically dedicate themselves to the monster-bashing &quot;gestalt&quot;, 
  but it's there if you want it and most seem to. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO also has very basic grouping features 
  now. Group members have a display that shows each member's health and mana, 
  and have buttons by each one that will automatically heal and cure them. Functions 
  such as adding group members and especially communicating within a group seem 
  unnecessarily arcane, however, and the whole system feels somewhat tacked-on. 
  It could use more refinement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many UO veterans may also remember 
  horror stories about UO's technical support staff (&quot;GMs&quot;, counselors, 
  and others). One of UO:R's stated objectives was in improving UO's support system, 
  and it has noticeably improved in quality if not quantity. Over the past six 
  months Origin has gone to great lengths to clean up UO, in some cases booting 
  entire guilds over system exploits and harrassment complaints, and just recently 
  forcing people with wildly offensive names to simply delete the offending character. 
  The system is draconian (the person in charge of it probably chose the handle 
  &quot;Tyrant&quot; for a reason) and many complain that innocent people have 
  been victimized by wide-ranging dragnets, but in the end it works. UO is a noticeably 
  more pleasant place to visit than it was. Rumors and whispers of GM abuse have, 
  although not disappeared entirely, decreased from a thundering roar of years 
  past. Although recent cutbacks by Origin seem to have reduced the number of 
  paid staff available (GMs now work all shards from a list instead of being assigned 
  to a particular shard, for example), thanks in large part to a huge corps of 
  volunteers calls for help are answered quickly and usually professionally. Another 
  in a long list flaws of UO finally being repaired.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given all of the above, what sort 
  of game is UO? How do these improvements change the game for the average player?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO is best looked at as a virtual 
  world. It goes the farthest of any MMORPG currently in putting the mechanics 
  of the game in the hands of its players - almost anything in UO is player-craftable, 
  and the economy of UO is one of its strongest creatures. Players can, and often 
  do, play UO without ever lifting a sword arm against another entity. It is no 
  accident that UO is also the game with the most actual role-playing going on. 
  So much so, in fact, that &quot;roleplayers&quot; are an actual political faction 
  within UO: The Metagame that I so enjoy writing about. UO is such a mature, 
  self-contained society that pressure groups within it already exist, organically 
  grown. That more than anything else is testament to its success. It's weird, 
  but it's true - players care about it enough to bicker endlessly about it, both 
  in and out of game. And whereas most bickering in games like Everquest involve 
  bickering with developers over how class such-and-such is broken, players in 
  UO are bickering <b>with each other</b>. It really is a virtual world. Believe 
  the hype.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far this review of UO:R has been 
  glowing, but there are some clouds on the horizon. Origin has played fast and 
  loose with the truth on occasion; the most glaring example was releasing the 
  UO:R boxes to stores weeks before the expansion was actually finished. Yes, 
  refunds were offered to offended buyers, and yes, the expansion itself was a 
  free download to existing players, but still, this would be <b>absolutely reprehensible</b> 
  conduct from any company. You don't send out an empty box with the words &quot;game 
  to be patched in later&quot;, but in a package where the main selling point 
  was in the above-detailed new features to UO, that's exactly what Origin did. 
  Other examples of &quot;broken promises&quot; include revamped magic and alchemy 
  subsystems that have been promised to the playerbase for <b>years</b> and are 
  now a consistent joke, and the somewhat newer &quot;it's not a mirror&quot; 
  joke where a Dev Team member posted on a message board that the &quot;new lands&quot; 
  of UO:R would not be an exact duplicate of the old ones, when in fact they functionally 
  are. Communication between players and developers is good, but only when those 
  developers can be trusted to actually tell the truth. Origin has tried hardest 
  of any gaming company in recent memory to be open and forthright with its users, 
  which makes these lapses in judgement all the more painful. A large percentage 
  of UO users simply don't trust Origin. That percentage has dropped, but it's 
  still there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO's development has also been marred 
  by haphazard quality assurance, which has been the bugaboo of every Origin product 
  for the past ten years. UO:R was no exception; the introduction of UO:R was 
  a complete disaster, and even when deployed to production shards game-crippling 
  bugs such as randomly disappearing items in the inventory of players caused 
  server warps that would basically invalidate anything a player did that day. 
  With every such disastrous major patch promises are made from Origin that lessons 
  have been learned and that future patches will not be such a fearsome occurance, 
  and those promises are never kept. It's time for Origin to learn how to bug 
  test, or perhaps hire enough people to actually debug their code. Players simply 
  should not have to deal with wondering what bugs have been introduced when the 
  UO Autopatcher fires off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, the above two paragraphs shouldn't 
  scare new users. (Make them wary, maybe.) Ultima Online, for its dated graphics 
  and occasionally psychotic userbase, is still the most advanced persistent world 
  out there. Everquest may have superior graphics and more to offer the virtual 
  explorer, and Asheron's Call may have the better game system and more responsive 
  dev team, but Ultima Online alone has nailed the many economic and physical 
  interactions that make up an immersive, addictive world. And a</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">s 
  I said, with this expansion, Ultima Online is finally done. What follows isn't 
  the efforts to fix a broken product, but to improve a good one. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I think I speak for every long-suffering, 
  but still loyal UO user, when I say that it's about damned time.</font></p>
