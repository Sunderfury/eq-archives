      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bah - who cares! I just wanna 
        kill stuff..... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, this is often the case 
        with players in online worlds, and it also seems to be the case with some 
        of the designers of these worlds. The economy is an afterthought, and 
        so far - no one seems to have come up with a system that really works. 
        Why SHOULD they care? Well, very much as in the real world - money makes 
        the world go round - or at least provides a counter whereby players can 
        'keep score'. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it provides a sense 
        of accomplishment, and a REAL working economy even more so. Even monster 
        slayers need an outlet for their loot. Everyone needs goods and services 
        every once in awhile - and a monetary system provides a much neater way 
        to do this than barter. Luckily - a virtual world economy is much easier 
        to control than the one in our real world. Unfortunately, so far - no 
        one seems to have the first virtual clue how to construct one of these 
        so that they don't melt down in short order. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some truths about 
        a healthy virtual economy: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Counterfeit currency (i.e., 
        duping) has the same effects that it does in RL - it waters down the value 
        of currency and therefore should be on the high crimes list. That said 
        - any effects of this will EVENTUALLY balance itself back out. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. A healthy economy has a 
        steady stream of money coming in from many sources. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. A healthy economy has a 
        steady stream of money going OUT of circulation between players. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. As a world matures some 
        players WILL become wealthy - those that spend long periods of time pursuing 
        this goal will achieve it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Money on its own - is worthless. 
        People perceive its value, but by itself it cannot be eaten, worn, or 
        lived in. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. In an RPG, non-player characters 
        are theoretically as legitimate as player characters for interaction - 
        including monetary interaction. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. An economy is the core of 
        a virtual world. Included in economy is anything of value, such as rare 
        or special items. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's look at this, point by 
        point - and see how the two major online worlds at present - Ultima Online 
        and Everquest - meet the criteria. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Counterfeit funds. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO had a major problem with 
        duplicating exploits early in its history. There were few controls in 
        place to track this sort of thing, and many castles sprung up overnight. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everquest just recently had 
        an instance of many people making 8000 Platinum and up overnight through 
        speculation on an item that the price had changed on. This was NOT making 
        money from thin air - this was some savvy folks taking a look at the programmers 
        over at Verant - and their track record on such matters and speculating. 
        In essence, this has the same effect - but is at the same time the essence 
        of good merchants everywhere, buy low, sell high - and do your homework. 
        This change was primarily because they were hell bent to ignore point 
        #6 - more on that later. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Many sources of income. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO does this very well - it 
        has many trade skills - as well as income from adventuring. Players to 
        some degree need the majority of craftable items. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everquest has taken the stance 
        that income should ONLY come through adventuring. They have limited the 
        cash in - to monster loot - and cash off of monsters. Trade skills in 
        Everquest are also very limited in items that a player can make to sell 
        to fellow players. This is not only very frustrating to the segment of 
        the population that don't care to primarily monster bash - but also has 
        taken away a very fundamental framework that makes the world seem 'real'. 
        Without many types of players with many different interests - you have 
        a very shallow albeit pretty hack n slash - a la Quake. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Many drains of items and 
        money - OUT of the world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neither of these worlds does 
        this well - and that is the number one reason an economy breaks down. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO does have item decay through 
        use. This helps a bit, but is a strain on server resources to track wear 
        and tear on items, and is also very irritating to players. While realistic 
        - and perhaps even necessary - UO also has problems with incredible amounts 
        of storage potential. Hoarding is also a problem - both in terms of economics, 
        and server resources. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EQ does not have item decay. 
        It also has limited storage. However, since EQ has decided to focus on 
        monster bashing as the only viable source of income for players - and 
        X item is introduced (and necessarily camped for funds) every X minutes 
        - divide by number of players on a server - eventually EVERYONE will have 
        this item. When an item becomes too common the price for it drops dramatically, 
        the bar is raised on what people perceive their 'starting equipment' should 
        be - it spirals not in cost, but in items. While some extremely expensive 
        items are available for players to purchase from NPCs that WOULD take 
        money out of circulation, these are so insanely expensive - and players 
        can find better on monsters - that very few people ever even consider 
        the purchase of these goods (steel plate and potions are good instances 
        of these). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Elder players are going 
        to become wealthy </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO has been going for 2 years 
        or so. Many MANY players have incredible wealth. Does this effect the 
        world at large - well, it can. Some things are very expensive to train 
        in - for instance - magery. Does the cash itself make a difference, no. 
        The fact that UO is a more full-bodied world in terms of economy - player 
        interaction - other things to do BESIDES fight monsters - and that MANY 
        players still subscribe are telling. Money in and of itself does nothing 
        but sit there and look shiny. UO has a land problem. People want houses, 
        but the physical landscape prevents placing anymore except on rare occasions. 
        This is about the only thing to spend vast amounts of wealth on in UO 
        - so funds sit in banks. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EQ is a much younger system. 
        Already - the money problems have hit EQ. EQ doesn't have anything like 
        houses to spend vast amounts of wealth on, although it too has just a 
        few skills that are incredibly expensive - jewelry and smithing for two. 
        Now THESE two skills are in demand by players - and the return is very 
        good - but at the same time Verant says trades shouldn't make money (from 
        NPCs) - they have given many players the capital to now train in the two 
        that DO make money - saturating the market with these two tradeskills 
        - undercutting those that had a much harder time developing these trades 
        - and eventually saturating the market with those non-decaying things 
        that CAN be made that players desire. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">E-bay syndrome: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is also a phenomenon 
        of players trading virtual money and gold for real world money on sites 
        such as E-bay. Some folks do not have time or patience to develop their 
        own characters, earn their own gold - or in the case of UO - there is 
        simply no room left to place a house. Both OSI and Verant take a dim view 
        of this - when they really should be welcoming it. What this does is redistributes 
        the wealth in-game. There is a danger of temptation to those with administrative 
        powers using this for real world financial gain - but that is due to poor 
        supervision of employees - not from this being a bad thing. If Verant 
        or OSI really wanted to defuse this activity - they need to take a proactive, 
        instead of reactive approach. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Let players have an in-game 
        way of trading excessive items and/or gold for game time. This translates 
        to real world dollars bottom line - and ALSO takes money and items out 
        of the world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. OSI and Verant should do 
        this themselves. WHAT! - yes you heard me. This activity cannot be stopped, 
        by doing it themselves, not only does it provide additional revenues - 
        it also defuses the market by players, since the companies themselves 
        can basically dictate the market. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. A combination of 1 and 2 
        - where the companies can resell what is bartered for game time, and also 
        siphon off goods and items as they think is necessary out of the world. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THAT'S NOT FAIR! Ummm, nothing 
        in any virtual world is ever going to be 'fair'. No one is put at a disadvantage 
        by this - money is a timesaver - it does not make up for skills or experience. 
        The perception of players is the only negative - and it is a false perception. 
        Longtime gamers know the irritation factor involved in 'newbieness' - 
        after making your Xth newbie character - the fascination with exploring 
        the world and building a character simply fades - you've matured past 
        that point, you want to get on with the program. Your other options to 
        this same end are - twinking - the process of having a higher level character 
        giving a lower level items and money - rampant at the moment in EQ. Buying 
        - which is exactly what is ALREADY happening over on E-bay. Time is money 
        - to some folks, it's worth it obviously. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OSI and Verant want people 
        to play and pay as long as possible. Given the fact that there is insane 
        amounts of wealth in UO - the theory that people will think they 'won' 
        when hitting a certain level, and they want to extend that as long as 
        possible - doesn't jive. In UO's case - it's because there are other things 
        to do, and socialization to fall back on. EQ may well suffer this problem 
        once everyone hits 50 - dumps their money and items on a new class and 
        rinse repeats. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Money - you can't eat it 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a certain point, money 
        just sits there and looks shiny. If there is nothing to buy - it just 
        starts to accumulate. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. NPCs are people too. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO takes the stance that NPCs 
        are as integral to the world at PCs. Merchants buy and sell. On the newest 
        shard - Siege Perilous, they got away from this, trying to take merchants 
        out of the equation. This is a mistake. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NPCs provide the safety net 
        for indispensable items - they also provide an item and money sink out 
        of the world. Granted - neither is the best solution - and a vendor system 
        that hits a middle mark would be preferable, more on that later. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EQ has just finished ripping 
        the trade skills to shreds. Visit any EQ message base, tradesmen are up 
        in arms. EQ has taken the stance that tradesmen should ONLY make money 
        from other players. NPCs are not in the equation. This puts the focus 
        squarely on adventuring for an income - and also disenfranchises any player 
        that does not care to be an adventurer. IMHO this makes for a much more 
        shallow world. Even hard core adventurers occasionally want a change of 
        pace. To make matters worse, there are precious few craftable items needed 
        by other players - AND - most of them can be purchased from NPCs more 
        cheaply than from players. It's pretty basic economics - If you can buy 
        from an NPC for less than it costs a craftsman to manufacture an item 
        - they will buy from NPCs. In their quest to try to force craftsmen into 
        PC to PC interaction, they have totally ignored PCs buying from NPCs - 
        I guess THAT is all right. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. It's the economy stupid! 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Game designers are going to 
        have to make a decision. Are they going to construct virtual worlds - 
        or are they making a hack n slash 'game', and trying to wrap it up in 
        pretty bows, and CALL it a virtual world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A virtual world mirrors our 
        own. There should be as many reasons and agendas for being there, as there 
        are players. Granted, most fall into some broad groups - but you have 
        to look at what builds a society and make sure that those needs are addressed. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two things that help promote 
        trade, and provide the glue that a society can start forming around are 
        need - and greed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If there is no NEED for items 
        - a craft system will never work. If there is no PROFIT in crafting items, 
        very few folks will waste their time with them. If everything can be found 
        'in the field' adventuring, there is also no need for someone to take 
        the time to create it. All right - why CAN'T everyone be an adventurer? 
        Well, for starters, not everyone wants to be - and more importantly, if 
        everyone is an adventurer, the world is very shallow - with only NPCs 
        populating the towns. To roleplayers, trades are often times easier to 
        use as a roleplaying vehicle than combat. This encourages getting to know 
        people, dealing with others, establishing repoire with customers - hopefully 
        for repeat business. Fictionally - it makes no sense for EVERYONE to be 
        the Avatar (oops) - Hero. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO comes much closer to addressing 
        this issue than does EQ. People have played UO for over 2 years, people 
        are starting to leave 'levelquest' in increasing numbers. Just as soon 
        as the new wears off - and they see they have no future as Norrath being 
        a place 'to live'. One common comment is "I can play Quake for free". 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only part that EQ got 'right' 
        about economy was their monetary system. By having 4 units of currency, 
        instead of just one, this allows for much tighter pricing, and negotiations. 
        It saddens me that Verant DID learn many valuable lessons from UO - and 
        that they totally ignored the parts that DID work - at least enough to 
        provide a base to improve upon. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK smartie - how ya gonna fix 
        it? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By going back to square one 
        - and looking at where money comes in, what is needed, where money goes 
        - and ways to suck it back out of circulation preventing TOO much pile 
        up (remember, some folks ARE gonna be stinkin rich). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NPC merchants are your safety 
        net. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They provide a needed service 
        - they are there when no one else is - for very, very basic - can't do 
        without items - they are the factor that spreads things out over time. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What NPCs SHOULD do: 1</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Carry the most basic of items, 
        in goodly numbers. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Buy craftable items at a 
        SMALL markup over cost to manufacture with modifiers for difficulty, quality, 
        need, etc. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Retain a percentage of goods 
        purchased for resale to players at a substantial markup - thereby providing 
        an outlet to craftsmen for a SMALL profit - retaining the desireablity 
        of dealing directly with a craftsman vs. the merchant and also functioning 
        as a siphon to take goods and money back out of the world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Stop buying once their quota 
        of an item is filled - and/or have the item set by player until the NPC 
        resets. An item they have none of should be more profitable to sell - 
        and item they have few of should be more expensive to buy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is an example. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Joe is a tailor, he buys hides 
        at 3g each - it takes 5 hides to make a tunic, but tunics are very difficult 
        to make, he may have 6 failures before he makes one. As his skill increases 
        - this number goes down substantially. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, here we have 15g per attempt 
        X 6 = 90g. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sarah is a merchant NPC - she 
        pays out 20g for leather tunics, and resells them to players for 250g. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, as Joe's skill increases, 
        and he makes less and less mistakes - he eventually gets to the point 
        that he can actually turn a profit selling to Sarah - not much, but at 
        the same time - SHE is selling them for 250g. Any player would be well 
        advised to seek Joe out and negotiate a price with him, somewhere UNDER 
        250g. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, how would a newbie ever 
        finance his education taking a 70g loss on every item? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, for starters, there is 
        still a large margin for negotiation between 90g and 250g - with plenty 
        of room for quality to be taken into account. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another option to decrease 
        cost is gathering the raw materials yourself. In this case time = money. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Joe gathers his own hides, 
        therefore - any profit he makes does not necessarily take a cash investment. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once Joe gets to the point 
        he HAS made a little profit - he can then pay others to hunt for him, 
        bringing him his raw materials instead of doing his own gathering - OR 
        he can maximize his profits by doing it himself still. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, although all these numbers 
        come out of a hat and are very flexible - the premise is simple cost accounting. 
        If everything starts with raw materials - gathering them yourself is always 
        an option, or paying others to gather them. NPCs should buy raw materials 
        always - at a very low rate of return, but it does make it an option for 
        new players to get their foot in the door, and also supplies craftsmen 
        when the gatherers are not around - and they don't want to do it themselves. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In UO - although tedious and 
        time consuming - some folks made LOTS of money selling to NPCs because 
        it was simply TOO profitable. On SP merchants buy nothing, this is already 
        creating a barter system, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but does 
        nothing to shortcut the money problem, it just forestalls it. It is also 
        creating a LOT of goods made for skill gain, and just thrown down on the 
        ground. Allowing income from NPCs is not a bad thing - as long as care 
        is taken to restrict the profits. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another aspect that skewed 
        the UO economy in regards to crafts - they are easily macroable. Restricting 
        how much a merchant will buy from any given player, or at any given time 
        goes a lot farther to address this problem, than having them not buy at 
        all. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recycling of items back into 
        raw materials - or at least a partial return is a far superior way of 
        letting craftsmen that want to gain skill do so, help with cost in training, 
        and not flood the world with unnecessary items (and as a side effect, 
        gold). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Decay of items is how UO addresses 
        some item sinks - but it's irritating. Yes, there needs to be consumables, 
        but they should not wear out at such a rate that inspires someone to take 
        up the craft themselves. There is a happy balance between needing to buy 
        hatchets to lumberjack - and having to be a tinker to do it yourself because 
        it breaks every 5 min (see SP). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Item and gold sinks: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that you have craftsmen 
        making SOME money from NPCs, adventurers bringing in cash and selling 
        loot from monsters - you now have established a way for cash to enter 
        the economy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Trading among players is grand, 
        wonderful, and the desired end - but if you don't have some sinks OUT 
        of the economy, the levels keep getting higher, and higher and all you 
        are doing is recirculating the ever increasing funds. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One way to do this, is have 
        a critical item that can ONLY be gotten from NPCs. One example of this 
        is reagents for Mages in UO. Yes, you CAN gather them occasionally yourself 
        in the field, but their numbers are scarce. No mage or alchemist is going 
        to be able to do anything meaningful with just that found in the wild. 
        While this is a good example - it's about the only one in UO. Magery is 
        powerful - it's expensive, it SHOULD be. Reagents should perhaps be even 
        MORE expensive than they currently are. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recycling items into component 
        parts is in development in UO - this will help GREATLY with unneeded, 
        unwanted, hoarded items. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One thing that should be looked 
        at in UO - recycling magical weapons or armor - should yield magical components. 
        If a magic halberd melts down to 3 ingots of that type of magic - this 
        would allow smiths of high skill to refashion them into something else. 
        This would cut massive inroads into chests and chests of hoarded - low 
        level magical items. Even if it was 'generic magic' - and smiths of high 
        level were allowed to use these somehow in a random manner for a CHANCE 
        of producing a random magical effect, this would have people melting down 
        items left and right, especially if these affects could be applied to 
        colored armor. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Supplying things that have 
        no tangible benefits whatsoever, but are ways for extremely rich elder 
        players to show status. One such proposal in UO was a "title". Providing 
        absolutely no benefit other than to show off wealth, players could purchase 
        a "title" from Lord British - wonderful money sink. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another option is in game gambling. 
        Anyone that has ever been to Los Wages, errrr. Los Vegas - knows that 
        great sums of wealth can be sucked from your pocket in a short amount 
        of time - but it's voluntary, supposedly fun (at least for those that 
        like that sort of thing) and would provide a wonderful way for money to 
        exit back out of the economy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, that's all well and good 
        - but how do you retrofit an economy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is the question that undoubtedly 
        has developers scratching their heads. They painted themselves into a 
        virtual economic corner, how do they get out - with their player base 
        intact, and into a system that is both more viable - and fair to both 
        the newcomer and elder player. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since EQ obviously has decided 
        to become a very pretty Quake - let's take a look at UO, and how this 
        economy can be 'fixed'. Note, all these have to be done and implemented 
        together. Piecemeal is worse than no change at all. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Every item has to be evaluated 
        - cost to manufacture/difficulty determined, merchant buy and sell prices 
        adjusted accordingly. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. I would implement a varied 
        monetary unit system a la EQ. Convert gold already in existence to the 
        new funds. Note: This will not be popular, but it will be fair since the 
        scale is merely a conversion. Set a base under which the truly poor have 
        a safety net, i.e., you can't start with less than X $. In some cases, 
        this will be BENEFICIAL, but will even itself out. No one 'loses' wealth 
        - it's just on a different scale, and is relative. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. All monster cash loot must 
        be adjusted to this system at the same time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Implement recycling and 
        make sure wear and tear on consumables is 'reasonable'. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Implement some kind of money 
        sinks a la the title or gambling proposals - or anything else that is 
        voluntary, visible or enjoyable and has the perception of status. Let 
        in game funds (a lot) purchase some playtime to drain the excesses. Got 
        4 million gold? OK, your next UO month is free. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are likely not to ever see 
        a true functioning economy in either EQ or UO - simply because the retrofit 
        is so exhaustive. I sincerely hope that upcoming worlds take a hard look 
        at what makes a virtual world really function - and spend as much time 
        considering if their economy really works, as they do tweaking combat.
