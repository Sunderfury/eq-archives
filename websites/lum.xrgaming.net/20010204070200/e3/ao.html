  <p><img src="omni.jpg" width="253" height="150" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anarchy 
    Online hasn't gotten much attention or press up to this point - but I <b>guarantee</b> 
    you that will change. Soon to go into open beta, AO is not only the only MMORPG 
    scheduled to be released in 2000, it is, quite simply, a technological marvel. 
    Along with the Crossroads staff, I was given a chance to view a detailed demonstration 
    of an alpha build of AO; even with some features still missing and the occasional 
    crash, what we saw will set the standard for online games. It's that good.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set in a far-future world with 
    an evil corporation beset by rebels (hm, where have we seen this before), 
    AO captures the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; feel fairly well. The game itself bears 
    some similarities to Everquest and Asheron's Call: players gain in levels 
    as they gain experience, and can use Increase Points (IP) they earn each level 
    to increase certain skills. There's some key differences as well; players 
    can purchase nanobots to augment their powers (a class, the nanomage, is AO's 
    version of the magic user class).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="ao1.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="left">AO's 
    story is vital to the game; the developers claim to have developed a four-year 
    story arc which the players can influence to a limited degree. Players who 
    choose Omni-Tek (the &quot;bad guys&quot;) get better equipment to start but 
    are limited in what actions they can take (following orders and whatnot) while 
    the rebels, being less organized, have a harder start but have much more freedom 
    in their actions. Players have to choose a side, and can't have a high-level 
    character on each side. AO has a geographical PK switch similar to Ultima 
    Online - cities are safe, and the further you go out from a city, the more 
    dangerous things get - first monsters, then the opposing side, and finally 
    you can be fair game to anyone if far enough away. The developers emphasized 
    that players could exist comfortably inside cities (which host an apartment 
    for every player), but the rewards outside would encourage players to take 
    the risk.</font></p>
  <table border="0" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">

      <td>
        <div align="center"><img src="quest.jpg" width="216" height="240"><br>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quest builder 
          interface. I realize<br>
          you can't actually see it, but it's there, <br>
          really.</font> </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AO's quest system also looked impressive, 
    even in its primitive state. The developers recognize that even with a paid 
    staff of plot-advancers they can't provide unique tailored quests for everyone 
    - so they've decided to give the players the ability to design their own. 
    Players can use their own personal treasure and experience point pool to reward 
    other players for designated actions. The list we were shown was fairly limited, 
    but included such things as attacking opposing clans, killing a specific enemy, 
    finding a specific item, etc. Even with this limited system, an ambitious 
    group of players could use the system to reward others for working towards 
    their own goals.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What truly impressed us about AO 
    was its graphics. Quite simply, they are outstanding. Players have a dizzying 
    array of &quot;emote&quot; animations that they can perform, for everything 
    from berating other players to, using a text-based scripting system, performing 
    entire plays. The animations themselves were unbelivable in the range of movement 
    and detail of the models (the meshes actually change depending on the clothing 
    used - a trenchcoat on a character really looks like a trenchcoat, not a form-fitted 
    skin) and animations can even play simultaneously - being shot while running, 
    for example. Landscapes can also be quite dramatic, with two suns casting 
    different colors of light upon reflective surfaces. Really, no screenshot 
    can do this game justice, especially the ones we were forced to take with 
    digital cameras accompanying this article.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Look for the beta to begin in July, 
    and the game itself to be released by the end of the year. This is definitely 
    one to watch for.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main thing in Anarchy 
    is the conflict between Omni-Tek, which is a very large corporation, and the 
    rebel clans. It’s on a distant planet called Rubi-Ka. Omni-Tek took this planet 
    and is using it for mining. The rebels are people who lived there before, 
    they know that Omni-Tek is going to use the planet and not care about how 
    it looks and pollution and all that, so they are trying to fight them. Omni-Tek 
    doesn’t really care about the rebels – they only care about profit, so if 
    the clans attack Omni-Tek, they will strike back, because they can’t afford 
    to lose any profit at all. </font></p>

    affect the story line by their actions?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: The story line is 
    already pre-written, but the players will have the possibility to change a 
    little bit – of course, if everybody’s going to be an Omni-Tek soldier, that’s 
    going to have a great impact on the game. We will then go and then try to 
    help the rebels so that the balance will even out a little bit. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: What’s to prevent someone

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C: You still have the 
    same name, though.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: Yeah. This is the 
    reference review. I can take notes on items, and drag and drop them to others 
    – “I really want you to go to this booth” for example. This is also used with 
    our quest system. We are aiming to make a lot of content in the game, enough 
    content for everybody. We don’t want any of the camping situations like what’s 
    in Everquest. We have two ways of doing this, one is the pre-generated quests, 
    and another is this system. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: You can add quests 
    to this, as a player?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: Yes. You can say whether 
    this for a person or your clan and give them to others.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Like, a guild in game 
    could make a quest open to anyone to kill an opposing guild.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: Yeah. When they create 
    a quest, I’ll say we put a time limit in it. I can’t show you all the possible 
    options here, but you can reward players with items, or with experience…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: And these have to be 
    things in your own inventory? What happens if you give experience, is that 
    taken from your experience pool?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: Yes. Anarchy Online 
    is level-based, like Everquest. You can’t have a high level character give 
    a lot of experience to a low level character, that creates balance issues. 
    So you have a high level character give a certain percentage of experience, 
    and the low level character gets that percentage. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Are the quests you 
    design using this system as well?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: Some are, and some 
    are used with our design tools, and some with our autoquest system. You can 
    go to an autoquest, and it will look at your level, and create a dungeon for 
    you. It will be unique every time you get it, and you can decide if you want 
    to share it with other characters or take it alone. And so we have unlimited 
    numbers of areas in the game. We don’t have “dungeons” like in fantasy games, 
    we have caves and mines, Omni-Tek buildings, etc. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: Is most of the action 
    supposed to be against the game or against other players?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: That’s up to  the 
    players playing,. Because we have put a lot of focus on the company vs. the 
    rebels. It’s like the Empire vs the Rebels in Star Wars. And people can stay 
    inside cities, where it’s safe, and get autogenerated quests and play against 
    monsters.  Or they can go outside the cities where it’s more dangerous. You’re 
    not able to fight inside the cities, you are secure, you can eat and dance… 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Like Ultima Online.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: Exactly. So we use 
    some monsters and they will attack you and you can attack them. And if you 
    go further away from the cities, you can attack the opposite side, and if 
    you go even further away you will be able to attack anything, it’s like mayhem. 
    People can decide what game they want. The further away they get from cities, 
    the more dangerous, but the more rewards they will get. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Do you have unique 
    items in the game, or are they randomly generated?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: We have both, We have 
    unique items, and we have weapons designed by the skill system.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: Do you have trade 
    skills, or any other noncombat skills?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: I’ll show you. We 
    have different professions… you can be a doctor, you can be a bureaucrat, 
    and they don’t have to be combat oriented. You can use the skills inside the 
    cities without combat. Like you are a doctor and you can create first aid 
    packages. This is a place where people can sit and have a few beers, and dance. 
    I’m going into third person now… I’m going to show you something not in the 
    final version, but what other people would see…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: So other people walking 
    into the bar would see this.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: Yes, people will go 
    inside and dance and have a good time… we are giving them other things than 
    slaying monsters. We have a few dances. I can do a ballet… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: This is like a new 
    trend in MMORPGs. There has to be dance animations.</font></p>

    we have people running it in 2048x1024x64,000 colors. I can go into other 
    inside areas. Let me show you some of the Omni-Tek housing. Every character 
    will get an apartment when they start the game. They start with just a small 
    room in a skyscraper complex. So they can have a bed, like a bank where they

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: Yes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: How many players can 
    the server support at the same time?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: We don’t really know…. 
    We’ve tested it with thousands of test clients running chat scripts, and it’s 
    scaleable… if it’s too much in one place then it will exchange some load to 
    another machine. But we will see how it goes in the beta test. We have a lot 
    of people to sign up already, and we are aiming for 60,000 on one world at 
    one time. We are trying to have only one world as opposed to other servers. 
    It is much easier to maintain a story line if you only have one world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LOH: How many slots for 
    characters does each player have?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: You have 8 characters. 
    But there will be restrictions on those characters; if you reach a high level 
    in Omni-Tek, we will not allow you to have a high level in the clans, because 
    the character will perceive what’s called what? Confidential information. 
    So if you have a level 50 character on one side you will not be able to have 
    a level 50 character on the other side. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here is the skill system. 
    When you get a new level, some of your new experience goes into increase points. 
    You can go into IP mode and use your IP points to lift up your skills. You 
    can’t just go on and use IP points, at one point you will have to get a high 
    level character to tutor you to gain skill levels. And you can tutor yourself 
    to other characters. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here is the friends system, 
    kind of like ICQ, you can just drop other players on it and talk to them if 
    they are online, </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: How many can you have?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: The limit is about 
    20 now, but we’re going to look at that, because we don’t know how much data 
    it will generate with a lot of people. So with these numbers will vary somewhat 
    just because we have to tweak them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LOH: How big is the world?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: It will take about 
    3 hours to run from one side of the map to the other?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: How many zones are 
    you going to have at launch?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: We’ll have 55 playfields. 
    We call them playfields instead of zones. Loading is really quickly, right 
    now it’s 8 seconds, we are aiming to get it to 5. This is the water, you can 
    see the light reflecting off the water… </font></p>
  <table border="0" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">
    <tr>

  </table>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One thing about the animations, 
    you can run and wave, and the animations will blend seamlessly into each other. 
    And if you get hit by a bullet, while running and waving, all the animations 
    will blend into each other. There is no running then stopping to do another 
    animation. You can do it all at one time. Here’s a waterfall. We’ve been trying 
    to create very beautiful landscapes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C: Can you swim?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: No, you can go in 
    the water but you can’t dive.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Is there any kind of 
    teleportation in the game?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: You will have some 
    teleporter pads to take you around the world, but they are very expensive. 
    There is a subway system that moves between the major towns, go inside, take 
    a train. You can actually go in the cars and go in wagon cars and baggage 
    cars. It will take some time because we want people to seem it is a big world, 
    but it will be much faster then running. It will not be totally secure, in 
    some wagons people will be able to attack you. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Will players be able 
    to craft their own weapons and armor?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: We have them as trade 
    skills, yes. We have weapon smithing and designing armors?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Can you design custom 
    made weapons to do various things?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: No, it’s not that 
    flexible. But you have a lot of items and you combine those items. Kind of 
    flexible but not infinitely so. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marduk: Can you craft 
    the same weapons as NPCs?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: Yes, they use the 
    same crafting code.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: When does the beta 
    start?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: We are set to start 
    beta in two months from now. We should release the game by the end of the 
    year, second half of the year. I think we are the only MMRPG coming out this 
    year.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C: Are you going to sign 
    with a publisher?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MA: We haven’t decided 
    that yet. That’s not really my area but I think we are going to try to publish 
    this ourselves.  </font></p>
