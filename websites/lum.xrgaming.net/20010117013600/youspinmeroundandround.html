  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I never expected to 

    be paid, although I was given the false impression several times that if I 

    'stuck with it', we would become 'paid' employees. After recent rumors about 

    off-site GMs, and being a paid employee, I renewed my delusions and continued 

    to put forth all my effort and time into working, for free. I was experiencing 

    my own life problems and trying to deal with them. When another Senior Counselor 

    sent all the Seniors an email complaining about similar problems, I replied, 

    and gave him advice and vented about how I felt about UO's support system. 

    He forwarded the email to Origin. They secretly removed me, and stole the 

    IRC channel I had founded on BeyondIRC. </i></font></p>

  about banning entire guilds, spending a large portion of their time bouncing 

  macroing players offline, and now this, <b>all in one week</b>,<b> </b>I'm beginning

  and further into memory, many of the &quot;regulars&quot; became despondent 

  that, without the hundreds of thousands of messages an hour to read and respond 

  to, they would actually have to play Ultima Online or worse, go outside. Lord 

  Luker, at last report, was holed up in the Washington Monument with &quot;lots 

  of explosives and other boom-type things&quot; threatening to remove the symbol 

  of our nation's capitol unless Designer Dragon implements a pvp switch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tonight it was disclosed 

  that CoB would reappear at a new confusing domain, since crossroadsrpg.com and 

  xrgn.com were both currently owned by the <a href="http://www.warzone.com/" target="_blank">Forces 

  of Evil</a>. Lum the Mad had no comment, since his Dev Board bookmark was still 

  pointing to crossroadsrpg.com and he thus thought that no one had anything to 

  say on the dev board now for several months. When informed differently, he muttered 

  something about nuclear shaped charges.</font></p>

    can go hunt down two reds who were just spotted down by the local mines...its 

    sad really. </i></font></p>

  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have seen my share

    made a character that doesn't die when he falls off east trinsic bank knows 

    that you need to macro to have a good character. Hardly anyone kills monsters 

    for fun, might as well mow the lawn or something. There are basically 4 groups 

    of UO players as I see it: Roleplayers who walk around speeking in Yee Oldie 

    English, Japanese players, PVPers, and Newbies. All PVPers macro, you know 

    that, I know that...people who say they don't macro are either really really 

    bad PVPers or lieing sacks of shit. </font></i></p>

    money instead of buying food. Some of us have lives, girl friends, wives,

    a guy running around with like 12 magery and 0.3 sword..now that would be

    all my friends on Napa Valley to follow in my foot steps. Which is about 15

  TwisTer, is <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html" target="_blank">PISSED</a>. 

  Apparently the kids that ride the short bus to school finally figured out how 

  to post on his message base and decided that his going without posting for a 

  day was some sort of wicked conspiracy. From his message base:</font></p>

<blockquote> 

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you all can see, Dr. 

    Twister didn't update today. Why ? I think it's because he is so pissed, cuz 

    all of us flamed him when he post a silly update (that one about MDK). But 

    because he is Doc, so it will be so embarrass to make public apologize. Well, 

    I think we all should forgive him for that mistake and keep going on new topic, 

    cuz he really put lots of effort on this web site (although some of the post 

    are silly). Doc, I hope we can see you keep updating as usual soon.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lord help the Republic if 

  I go three hours without an update, I guess... (although some of the post are 

  silly).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For what it's worth, my 

  opinion on the TwisTed one is decidedly mixed. On the one hand, he has the balls 

  to post what he finds out in public, instead of trying to keep the bugs that 

  come his way limited to the KeWli0 3l33t. So many folks are able to defend themselves 

  from the latest KeWl Vendor Delete. On the other hand, he often holds off on 

  posting nasty exploits like house breakins until he knows the GMs are off duty 

  for maximum exposure. Another choice quote:</font></p>

<blockquote>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well normally I don't 

    post information I get from the Test Center, for obvious reasons, it gives 

    us a better chance of getting the same bug on the private shards with the

  never actually be told this, unless you read &quot;Dr.&quot; TwisTer's site,

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me tell 

  you a story, my children...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was a 

  land once, we'll call it the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, just for shits 

  and giggles. There was this event called the Great Purge, where a very bad man 

  named Stalin sent millions of people to labor camps merely for looking sideways.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was a 

  little boy, named Pavlik Morozov. He was a very studious boy, and did very well 

  in school. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One day his 

  teachers explained to him what &quot;class enemies&quot; and &quot;enemies of 

  the people&quot; were. They were bad people, who worked against Comrade Stalin 

  and his glorious worker's paradise. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pavlik was 

  told that it was his duty, as a little soldier in service to the state, to tell 

  his teachers of anyone who was an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;. Even his 

  parents. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pavlik was 

  confused, but he did what he was told, and told his teachers about the conversations 

  his parents had late at night, when no one was listening, about how Comrade 

  Stalin was really a monster destroying his country.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pavlik's parents 

  disappeared soon thereafter, and Pavlik was sent to a camp for good little soldiers. 

  There was even a statue to Pavlik in his home town, as an example to all good 

  little soldiers. Children everywhere in the USSR were told to be noble as Pavlik, 

  to tell their teachers and policemen whenever anyone said bad things.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they did. 

  The children were the worst scourges of the land, <b>because they were given 

  the power to be so</b>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I am not 

  so ate up with it that I think being prohibited from macroing in any way relates 

  to the annihilation of a people. But that's not the point.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The USSR was 

  a corrupt land, and it was made so in large part by the rendering of the rule 

  of law as trivial. There was no overriding set of rules that a sane person could 

  follow - people were killed for espousing a particular Party line one month, 

  and be rewarded for it the next. The enforcement of &quot;law&quot; was capricious 

  and whimsical, and this bred terror.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Terror.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already 

  established that 95% of the UO population (and 99.99999% of the pvp subset) 

  macros. We are all criminals now - we can be removed from the game at will. 

  </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we won't. 

  We'll continue to build our characters in the same fashion, simply because there 

  is no alternative. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And anyone 

  who has a grudge can fill up GM page queues - &quot;Joe Bob is macro mining&quot; 

  &quot;Marcus is a red ghost in a dungeon macroing&quot; &quot;Sally is in her

  - and according to the support chat log posted, they have said that <b>they 

  will follow up on it, despite knowing the workload nightmare it will cause.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does it sound 

  like it?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It strikes 

  me more as some folks developing an overwhelming sense of their own self-importance 

  - that given a &quot;god like power&quot; over their little milieu, they are 

  taking it and running with it. Banning entire guilds, detaling the minions to 

  go spy on those that they may disagree with for rules violations - rules that 

  <b>everyone </b> violates, that every honest person agrees is a complete joke...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And you're
