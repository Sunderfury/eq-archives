<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Times New Roman">Okay, I got an email about my
account being banned.<o:p/></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Times New Roman"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Times New Roman">It says the last thing that I
did, which I was permanently banned for was unattended macroing. I have checked
the websites and asked counselors about it. The old answers were that macroing
without a third party program was alright, but that the new rule was that there
was no unattended macroing allowed at all if done repeatedly. The exact words
from the website are:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>&quot; Repeatedly
engaging in unattended macroing &quot;<o:p/></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Times New Roman"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Times New Roman">Okay, so I don't understand why
I was banned for macroing one time? I had never received warnings about unattended
macroing before. To my knowledge it was alright to macro unattended without
third party programs, I had taped down a macro key to summon an earth
elemental. Counselors had told me in the past that that was alright. But I have
figured out that there are new rules against that, but of course I didn't know that
until after I was banned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So I am just
wondering why I was banned the first time, instead of getting a warning? I had
no idea that macroing unattended was illegal, a lot of people I know do it, so
I figured it was alright. I believe I should have been warned about it in-game
first, so that I could know before I did it again, then be banned if I kept on
doing it. But maybe it's too late for that now =(</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Times New Roman"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font face="Times New Roman">Also, some strange things
happened surrounding my banning. After I was banned, my password to my account
was changed to something I had never changed it to. I did not change it, and no
one else knows my password. So I figure that OSI changed the password as a
penalty box type thing when I was banned, maybe? I have no idea. Also, some of
my characters were owners of houses that I was letting friends live inside of.
On the day after I was banned, the items inside the house were there. The next day,
my password was changed like I said and all the items inside of my houses were
gone, and keys to them did not work, and the house signs were changed. This
caused my friends to lose all of their items, besides what they had in their
bank boxes. Now since my account was already blocked when the items were taken
out of my houses, I know that it was not someone who had hacked my account or
whatnot and looted the items. So since my account was blocked at the time, the
only person who could have taken the locked down items would have to be some
sort of GameMaster. So I am wondering why this was done? I don't understand why
the stuff inside of houses that were owned by my characters was deleted. <o:p/></font></p>
