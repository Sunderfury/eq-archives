<blockquote> 
  <p><img src="sb1.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eagerly 
    awaited by a rabid fan &quot;underground&quot;, Shadowbane made its public 
    debut at e3 this week. We took a look at a demonstration, and liked what we 
    saw. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unlike other games that try to 
    get as many customers - and satisfy as many playstyles - as possible, Shadowbane 
    is focused on one thing - player conflict. Players who have cut their teeth 
    on Ultima Online and other &quot;PK&quot; worlds may be in for a rude shock, 
    though, when they discover exactly what the developers, Wolfpack Studios, 
    mean by player conflict. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="sb2.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right">Basically, 
    Shadowbane models the seizure of territory. Players can take and build up 
    a town (the mechanics of which seem to be still under wraps, but involve &quot;choking 
    off the town's resources&quot;), which then becomes their home base, their 
    point of recall/respawn, etc. Wolfpack believes that since players have a 
    geographic point of origin that can be easily traced, if someone decides to 
    kill someone else, their victim knows where to find them. And, presumably, 
    bring along some friends.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It gets better. Cities combine 
    to form nations (the upkeep needs are greater, requiring ever larger guilds 
    to hold them) and those nations can form alliances - and break them when circumstances 
    warrant. (&quot;Hey! Why should I pay you taxes, when I can keep all this 
    money for myself!&quot;) Concievably, a nation can even seize control of an 
    entire world - a feat which Todd &quot;Warden&quot; Coleman speculated might 
    even be rewarded by Wolfpack with a coronation ceremony!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="sb3.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="left">All 
    this is surrounded by an ongoing plot, maintained by on-site &quot;feature 
    characters&quot; that move along the plot by taking the part of various deities, 
    heroes and rulers. They set the stage for possible conflict by, say, asking 
    three guilds to obtain a scepter from a temple, while a fourth guild may be 
    called upon to protect it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One question that often comes up 
    when discussing a PvP-intensive game like Shadowbane - well, Shadowbane is 
    the only one in development, actually - is the problem of grief PKers, or 
    as Warden terms them, &quot;roving bands of thugs&quot;. It is possible to 
    be in a roving band of thugs, but the game won't reward you for it. True power 
    in Shadowbane comes from holding on to territory - and territory implies responsibility, 
    in the most feudal sense. And since true power comes from this, the grief 
    PKers - who are also usually powergamers to the nth order - will pick up on 
    this, and Play Nice. Without a Play Nice Policy, at that. It'll be interesting 
    to see how this works out, and is certainly a unique concept.</font></p>
  <p><img src="sb4.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shadowbane 
    is a gutsy game in a number of ways. The game rewards nation building, diplomacy, 
    and cooperation, something that PvPers in online games are not universally 
    known for. And the game promises to be heavily influenced by its plotline, 
    something which could cause its customers to actually utter the dreaded &quot;RP&quot; 
    word. The engine itself seems fairly far along in development; we weren't 
    able to see an actual running copy, but an &quot;in-flight film&quot; of a 
    session, a feature of Shadowbane that allows you to save movies of your greatest 
    victories in a small file format and play them within the engine. Although 
    surely some enterprising hacker will discover the format and &quot;rewrite&quot; 
    history, it does give new meaning to the kill shot.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does Shadowbane itself have a kill 
    shot in its future? We'll find out soon enough. The question really is, are 
    the players ready for it?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Interview with Todd &quot;Warden&quot; 
    Coleman, Josef &quot;Arcane&quot; Hall, James Nance, and Brian &quot;Balseraph&quot; 
    Urbanek </b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Josef Hall: So I’ll start 
    off with what we’re looking at here, which is actually…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Todd Coleman: A new exclusive 
    break! We haven’t told anyone else about this!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Yeah, we’re not on 
    the network, they couldn’t get us a connection. So we built the Shadowbane 
    Player, which actually allows you in-game to record anything that happens, 
    like if you’re doing a guild battle, and thinking “oh, this is gonna be a 
    great scene.” You hit Record…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="sb5.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lum: 
    Like an in-flight recorder for a flight sim.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Exactly. That’s exactly 
    right.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: That’s a format you 
    can turn around and…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: …you can put it on 
    your website and… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Instead of “kill shots” 
    you have “kill movies”.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: And it’s like a 42k 
    file. It’s even more than “kill movies”…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: So it’s not a rendered 
    scene, like an MPEG…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: No. I’m in one now, 
    zooming around…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: You have control over 
    all the interfaces, but you can also have plays and movies…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Do you get frame rates 
    like this in the engine? I mean, live, when you’re actually on the network.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Yeah. Actually, what 
    you’re watching, our player, is actually the engine itself, being able to 
    read a particular file that we dumped out. It’s actually a capture of the 
    bandwidth that we use on the server, and the files are tiny.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: It’s pretty clever, 
    because what it basically does is open a file and grabs every message that 
    comes down from the server, and stores it. And then what you do is instead 
    of logging into the server, log into this file and pretend that’s the server. 
    So, it basically just as people are moving around and things are happening, 
    it’s stored into memory. Basically you’re moving back in time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Virgil: I wonder what 
    people are going to do when they figure out the format of that file.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: I see you’ve got text 
    both above the head and in a text window. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Yeah, it’s all optional, 
    a lot of people really like having text appear above the head. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: What kind of range 
    does that have? If someone wasn’t on screen would you still see what they 
    are saying?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: We have a local area 
    and anything that happens in a local area, you’re concerned with on your client. 
    It helps us basically weed out any messages you’re not concerned with. Like 
    a web browser, as you run around the world, things get streamed down to you, 
    on the fly. So if there’s new objects that we’ve created; you’ve never seen 
    the golden rune sword, for example, it’s streamed down to you in another thread. 
    You don’t have to do a “patch” download or anything like that. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">V: That covers graphics, 
    too?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: That’s right. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: It also has a default 
    tree built into it. So if I walk up to a guy that has adventuring zones that 
    I’ve never been in, that’s wearing oriental armor with a big katana, it’ll 
    say, well, OK, I don’t know that, let’s put him in scale mail with a longsword, 
    we’ll start streaming it in the background, and when the actual stuff comes 
    in, it pops. So it’s a little annoying that it pops, but it only pops that 
    first time, from that point on you see oriental armor with a katana. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Are you using a zone-based 
    architecture?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: No, it’s actually 
    a contiguous world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Underneath the covers, 
    though, we have a grouping object we call a zone, just for repop purposes. 
    For example, “the orc fort” needs to reload all its monsters and items. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: So that’s an example 
    of the overhead radar.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Yes. This is a computer 
    generated world. It’s a multi-fractal system, actually, we give a random seed 
    value to the client, none of this comes from the server. The client can completely 
    generate the world, except for the tilesets, which you get initially. The 
    server can say, “This is the Snow World, or the Ice World, and it has this 
    tileset.” It can completely generate the entire world, as you run around. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James Nance: So there’s 
    no download time on new areas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: That’s right. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: How does it sync up 
    with other players you’re with, though?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: It’s not a random 
    generator, it’s a preset set of files. Let’s say, I set a seed value of 739. 
    Any person with the right seed value, their client will now generate the world, 
    generated identically because it’s not random. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Because it uses the 
    same seed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Exactly. It uses the 
    same seed, so instead of downloading an entire new world, you get the seed 
    value – a couple of bytes – and all the god-power. The keeps, the people, 
    and all that kind of stuff. But basically, the world is already set. All the 
    human adds are on top of that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Another thing that’s 
    interesting is our interface. It’s completely configurable – the textures 
    can be replaced. It’s a skinnable interface. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: So you could have a 
    guild skin.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: That’s exactly right. 
    Big guild crest with the buttons below. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Is there a way to, 
    in game or out of game, exchange these skins?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Sure. They’re bitmaps. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: It’s a system of bitmaps 
    with a menu script that we built. In case you wanted to completely rearrange 
    where the buttons pop up. I think the guilds will get real excited about that, 
    because not only do we have a system where you can composite your own guild 
    crest, but now you’ll be able to have your own interface for your guild. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: I like that map up 
    there – that is a map right?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: And the crosshairs 
    – those are other players?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Right. And we’re basically 
    at the end of this particular playback. We have different modes for the camera 
    – right now I’m just in a free form mode, and this is auto-tracking, which 
    is like Auto-Tracking where the camera follows behind your character. We really 
    wanted this view [isometric], it’s like a massively multiplayer 3D Diablo, 
    that’s the game we all wanted to play…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: YEAH! And you guys 
    slammed me, I might add, when I said I wanted to play that!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Everyone: (laughs)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: When I said “If you 
    like Diablo, you’ll want to play this” and you all were all “Oh, well…”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: We slam you for everything 
    you say. That’s our job!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Good point. On the 
    list of things I’ve been slammed over, that was actually pretty minor. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Some of the technology 
    is going to help us, I think. Other then the fact that we’re going at a new 
    angle, where people will form these guilds and chat with each other and then 
    go out and raid other people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: How does the skill 
    system work?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Let me back up before 
    I hit skills, because there’s a base character system , character creation, 
    things like that, that it makes more sense. You start with character creation. 
    It’s a point based character creation system, very similar to GURPS, or Champions, 
    or Hero, or something like that. Obviously different stats and those kind 
    of things, but very similar in nature. So I start out by choosing a class. 
    I choose a base class, and there’s four basics. Fighter, Healer, Mage and 
    Rogue. From there, once I get in game, I can go around and learn the ropes 
    a little bit, I can go to newbie areas and be protected. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Like newbie school 
    in a MUD.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Yeah, pretty much. 
    So what happens at that point, is right about the time I hit fifth level-ish, 
    that’s when I start looking for an organization to join. There’s a number 
    of specialization classes, I think there’s like 22 of them, and those specialization 
    classes, you can join them depending on your pre-reqs. For example, to be 
    a ranger, I could start as either a fighter or as a rogue. Both will allow 
    me to get into the ranger’s organization, once I join a rangers-type organization, 
    I can become a ranger. So that’s my specialization. Now I’m a ranger for the 
    rest of my levels. At various points in the game, I can take a sub class, 
    if I choose to do so, called a discipline. I don’t have to. If I do, it’s 
    giving me new powers. Like, alchemy is a discipline, blacksmithing is a discipline, 
    that’s the closest we get to trade skills. You have other disciplines, like 
    blade mastery is a discipline. There are something like 40 disciplines. I 
    can give you the exact numbers later, it’s hard for me to remember the exact 
    numbers off the top of my head. That allows me to make a ranger-blademaster-beastmaster…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: What kind of feedback 
    do you have during this process? I assume you’re using experience points for 
    advancement.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
    TC: Yes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Can you see how many 
    experience points you have, how many you need to get to the next level…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Instead of gaining 
    towards experience, every level is 10,000 experience marching down to zero. 
    So what happens is, if I kill a raven at level 1, it may give me 25 experience. 
    Now at level 2, if I go kill that raven, I’m only going to get 15. Eventually 
    I get zero for it. So it’s not going to be worth my time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: But you have feedback 
    for all this.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Yes. It’ll say “Experience 
    to next level: 8,732.” </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Do you have the same 
    kind of feedback for skill gain?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Yes. It’ll say, “To 
    get your skill to the next level, you put in 3 points”. There’s actually two 
    different things that you get for taking either a class or a discipline. You 
    get skills, on one side, and you get powers on the other side. So for an example, 
    a fighter might get a lot of skills, whereas a mage would end up getting a 
    lot of powers. And within powers you’ll have a whole bunch of types as well 
    -  you’ll have faith-based powers, lore-based powers and special maneuvers. 
    So a blademaster may have a whirlwind attack that’s a special maneuver power. 
    And he kicks it off, and it does some special effect. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Do these come automatically, 
    or through some quest in the game?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: You get them based 
    on level, on other things that you already have. For example you might have 
    Air Storm, and you may have to have Whirlwind at rank 3 to be able to learn 
    it already, and you get it based on your class and discipline.  So I get Blade 
    Mastery, and that opens up 7 or 15 new powers that become available to me 
    through the course of gameplay. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: But everyone has access 
    to these, it’s not like something, say, like one guild has access to this 
    one part of the world so they can monopolize this one special power.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: No, that won’t happen. 
    It’ll be world to world. We’ll have certain worlds later down the line, we 
    hope to add additional worlds with different races, things like that, as an 
    expansion pack . But when the game goes release, everything will be available 
    to everybody, based on the pre-reqs. So for example, if I want to get Elven 
    Healing. I have to be an Elf. Or I want to get Blade Singing. I can’t get 
    Blade Singing if I’m a Dwarf. So there are pre-reqs built into it. But it’s 
    available to any player, provided they have the right pre-reqs. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: Since you’re level 
    based, aren’t you afraid there’s going to be an “end” to the game?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Well, the game is 
    on two levels, so there’s a yes and a no. The yes is, yes the RPG, eventually 
    you’ll level out. You’ll have the highest level, the best equipment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: What is the highest 
    level?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: That’s interesting. 
    Everything is a little bit different with us. There’s no max max level, what 
    there is is a soft cap. You hit a point at about 50<sup>th</sup> or 60<sup>th</sup> 
    level, where it becomes exponentially harder to gain a level, and you gain 
    so little for it it’s not worth it any longer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: We’ll have lifetime 
    players with levels and people will go “oh my god, I never thought anyone 
    could be that level.”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: That’s the basic game. 
    Keep in mind we have another layer, the strategy game. And you can be first 
    level, and still take part in the strategy game. I want to be a diplomat, 
    say, if  I’m really good with people and get an army underneath me, and get 
    them to take a city, I can be king of a city-state and still be first level. 
    We’ve got a bunch of different organization types, and depending on your organization 
    type, that determines, at least a little bit on a roleplaying level, the type 
    of your nation. Some people will play that and actually enjoy that, some people 
    won’t. You’ll see some people that take over a city, be a Templar’s Guild 
    consisting only of Templars and we actually roleplay it. Some people won’t. 
    But you know, it’s still, by putting it into the game and allowing it to have 
    an influence on gameplay, we still expect it’ll add to the overall atmosphere. 
    I guess that’s my longwinded answer to your question.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Brian had mentioned 
    outside that players can build towns, and build buildings based on certain 
    criteria…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Yes, they can.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: How does that work? 
    How would a high level guild that wants to own a particular patch of real 
    estate go about building a town?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: You don’t build a 
    town so much as you take a town. So, initially, there’s going to be a land 
    rush. People run out and find the town areas and take them. You’re going to 
    have a lot of turmoil just in the beginning, until things start to settle 
    out. Beyond that, I can either go and acquire towns through diplomacy – meaning 
    if I have a town and you’re my neighbor, and I’ve got a really big army, I 
    can go and say “hey, swear fealty to me, and we’ll never attack you.”</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: So these towns are 
    pre-placed?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: They are preplaced, 
    yes. We would like to find a mechanism to allow people to do it, but we’ve 
    never done it and it’s not in the spec right now. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Right now the towns 
    are preplaced, fully built. There is a guildstone that is preplaced, and those 
    are centers of power. You can claim your stone if it hasn’t been claimed and 
    build your town up around that. But there has been some internal questioning 
    as to whether it’d be really cool if people could place the guildstones and 
    spawn a town in a particular area. Our initial concern is you have these big 
    clusters of towns, and we really want people to spread out. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: How would an opposing 
    guild take over a town?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: I’ll give you some 
    of the information, but we haven’t released all of the guild stuff. Basically 
    the process involves choking off the resources to the city, over a period 
    of 24 to 78 hours. That makes the burden of work on the attacker, by far. 
    We want that on purpose. If you own a city, it should be very hard for someone 
    to displace you and kick you out. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: How would you choke 
    off resources in an engine like this?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: That’s the one thing 
    I can’t talk about. There’s a really cool way in which you actually have to 
    lay siege. And the defenders, their burden of work is to go out and break 
    your siege, and send you packing back home. So it’ll be a really interesting 
    phenomenon, seeing people besiege towns. I think you’ll end up having in the 
    game – this is our suspicion, but we don’t know – we’ll end up having certain 
    areas that have longstanding guilds, that because of the way alliances form 
    and because of the way they are set out, they are basically stable, and they 
    won’t change for years, conceivably. You’ll have other areas that are more 
    like the badlands, and they will be toppled almost constantly. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Do you have some areas 
    that are more valuable then others? More resources, for example. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Not right now. Typically, 
    not in game terms. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: There’s no advantage 
    to having one guildstone over another, then. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: The only ones are 
    the ones that come naturally out of the game based on terrain. If I have one 
    that was, say, on an island, because it was randomly generated, as part of 
    the world generation, that’s pretty cool, and it might have some intrinsic 
    value. It’s better than other places. But it’s nothing like, this one has 
    a 17 rank,  and this one has a 42 rank, therefore I’d rather have one other 
    the other.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Can guilds control 
    more than one town?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Yes, they can. Nations 
    can grow, not just through warfare, but also through diplomacy. If I go, and 
    I convince you that it’s in your best interest to join the city with the three 
    other city-states, the small hegemony that I’ve built, you can actually swear 
    fealty to me and then you’re now a part of that overall nation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Is that enforced in-game?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Yes, it’s enforced 
    in-game in terms of the hierarchy. If you come and swear fealty to me, then 
    when someone else comes in our town, they’ll see the nation guildcrest and 
    they’ll see our guildcrest. Our sub-guildcrest. You’ll still hold the town, 
    you’ll have control of the resources, that allow you to build the buildings 
    and things like that, there is an ingame mechanics. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: There’s also points 
    depending on the size of the guild. A tiny tiny guild taking over a town won’t 
    be able to maintain it very long. And at the same time it would take a huge 
    guild  to hold multiple towns. So we try to keep people from becoming too 
    powerful that way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: The way it’s engineered 
    is that, because we get this question all the time, is it possible for one 
    guild to take over a world? It is, we don’t see it happening, but if it does, 
    we’re cool with it! In fact, we’ve talked about having a coronation ceremony 
    –</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Flying the guy down 
    to Austin…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: …whoever the first 
    King or Queen is of a single world. The reason is that…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Well, that’s how you 
    win!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(laughter)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: …having that much 
    land is going to require more and more players. And if we hit a point where 
    90% or 80% of the players want to be under one king, it’s the will of the 
    players. So we’re not going to stop it – great! That’s what they want to pay 
    for, that’s what they want to do. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Someone really charismatic…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L:  But say another player 
    turns around and is really miffed at these guys, and wants to organize a revolution…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: It’s gonna all come 
    crumbling down!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Hence the drama!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Now, how easy it is 
    using the diplomatic system, for one guild to stab another guild in the back?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: It’s reeeealy easy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Really, really, really 
    easy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: You totally know what 
    we’re getting at here. Not only is it easy, you are enticed to do it. At any 
    given moment, let’s say, you decide to build a nation. You take a city, then 
    take another one, and I’m your lieutenant. You can’t hold both cities. You 
    have to have someone else take over the second city, swearing fealty to you.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: And you have to trust 
    them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: You have to trust 
    them. At any given moment, I can turn on you like that. (snaps fingers)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: Why would I keep paying 
    taxes to Todd, when I could just keep them for myself?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Exactly. So you are 
    very much enticed, at any given moment. And it was done on purpose. Both human 
    nature and our systems make it to where the higher you get in terms of nation 
    building, it’s like a deck of cards. Every additional card you put on is a 
    little bit more strain, and could cause the whole thing to fall down. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Now what reason is 
    there for a guild to take over a town, and hold it, and do nation-building, 
    as opposed to just being a blight on the landscape, running around and killing 
    everything they see?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: A lot of the ingame, 
    in fact, most of the power gained in game, requires you to be a part of a 
    city. At a minimum, you have to join a GM-run guild which is in the safe haven 
    area, but the safe haven areas only let you get up to about half level. You 
    want to do that, you’re certainly welcome to. But if you want to be a hero 
    in the world, you’re eventually going to have to take a little bit of risk 
    and venture out into the dangerous areas. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: So there are safe 
    areas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: There are safe areas. 
    There are cities that can’t go to war. They are GM run cities. So they basically 
    are preset at about mid-level, and mid-level training facilities, mid-level 
    shops.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: We have a good vision 
    for the game we’re trying to build, but we want to give people a chance to 
    go into a GM-run town, and enjoy the game, because we think it’s going to 
    be really rich.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: The more complicated 
    a game is, the more frustrating it is to just get whacked, you don’t even 
    know how to walk around, and here’s this idiot attacking you. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: There’s also another 
    thing, which is penalty of death. If you take a game like Duke Nuke’Em, something 
    like that, deathmatch. You don’t care if you die, it doesn’t matter. You just 
    run back into the fray. Obviously that’s one end of the spectrum and some 
    of the other massively multiplayer games have gone to the other end of the 
    spectrum. If you die, it hurts you pretty badly. It puts you back a week’s 
    worth of game play. We decided we’d skew more towards this side of the spectrum. 
    What we don’t want is people running into the fray, and dying, and running 
    right back into the fray. We don’t want a shoot-em-up. But we don’t want the 
    penalty to be so severe that if someone does kills you and it had nothing 
    to do with you, you just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, 
    it shouldn’t be that severe. The penalty also scales based on the challenge 
    it was for that player. If I’m 10<sup>th</sup> level, and James is 70<sup>th</sup> 
    level, and he kills me, it’s basically a free teleport back to town. It doesn’t 
    hurt me at all, because I could never possibly beat him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: And I get nothing 
    for it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: And he gets nothing 
    for it, moreover. I keep all my stuff, I keep all my experience, he’s gained 
    pretty much nothing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: We’re also thinking 
    the guild system will add a layer of accountability to the entire system. 
    If somebody kills me, and I see their guild crest, which I will see before 
    I die, I know that the Band of the Hand was the group that killed me. And 
    I’m going to tell the rest of my guildmates, the Band of the Hand has been 
    picking on us. Killing us. We can form a treaty or do whatever needs to be 
    done to make sure that doesn’t happen.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: The big problem I 
    have with the, I call them “roving bands of thugs”. The roving bands of thugs 
    syndrome that you see in some of the other games, is because there’s absolutely 
    no accountability. If I kill you, I don’t have to worry about you seeing me 
    ever again, you don’t know my name, you can’t find me, I can go to another 
    city, I can teleport across the world without even thinking about it, it’s 
    no big deal. In ours, they know where to find you, because you can only recall 
    back to one spot, the middle of your town. That’s where you train, that’s 
    where you heal, that’s where you buy and sell your equipment, everything revolves 
    around that town. You want to form a roving band of thugs, you can do it, 
    but you won’t be very effective in the game. The game system doesn’t make 
    it a very effective way to play. And that’s the way I think you deal with 
    problem players, the playerkillers and things like that, if you want to entice 
    them, don’t tell them “don’t do this or we’ll ban you”,  don’t tell them “don’t 
    do this because you signed a code of conduct”, you tell them “if you want 
    to do that, you can, you just won’t be very powerful in the game.” Because 
    that’s the one thing they listen to – what’s going to make me powerful in 
    this game. So that was our design philosophy on everything we did.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: Never underestimate 
    a snert.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Oh, the years we ran 
    MUDs, we knew you just can’t underestimate them. It’s amazing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: They will go to any 
    length to ruin your day. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Yes. Absolutely.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: That’s their goal 
    – to ruin your day. It’s not for power or goodies, but to piss someone else 
    off. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: But if the penalty 
    is so severe, that my doing it will actually hurt my character overall, they 
    probably won’t. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: If you have refuge 
    in your guild, if you’re a member of your guild, and they want to come in, 
    they can’t, especially if the guards start attacking them every time. They 
    just won’t be able to get to you unless they go through your friends. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: And if you’re in a 
    GM held town they can’t get to you at all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: The neat thing about 
    accountability with the guildcrests is that it gives you multiple avenues 
    to resolve a problem. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: So what keeps someone 
    from just resigning from a guild? Changing and going to another?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: They will never level 
    again, they can’t get their items repaired, they have nowhere to hide. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Well, they could join 
    another guild, couldn’t they?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: They could join another 
    guild. And now that guild is going to have to deal with that person. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: But the thing is, 
    since the guild leaders have invested the time to build up their guild, they 
    may not want those people in their organization. It’s not just a matter of 
    “now I know who’s butt to go kick, and I can get my friends to do that”, but 
    I can go through channels. My guild leader can talk to his guild leader. Tell 
    him “you guys don’t’ want a guild war. It’s bad for business. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: I don’t know, retaliatory 
    strikes are fun, too…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(laughing)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: But it gives players 
    a choice. They can say “reign your buddy in, or we’re going to go to war.” 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: How many character 
    slots do you have?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: 5 per account. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Unique character names?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: No. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: We have a “true name” 
    that you put in, and we didn’t use the account name, because there are some 
    people who like to roleplay different people, and they don’t want necessarily 
    to be known, so you enter for each character the name used in the game and 
    also a true name.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Jumping back to the 
    diplomacy system for a second, you were mentioning guilds being townbased. 
    What is the quantifiable benefit for them owning more than one town? Do they 
    get more resources, do their towns get more powerful?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: They will end up getting 
    more resources. Overall, there’s also the “cool factor”, which shouldn’t be 
    discounted. Just owning a town? Hey, that’s really cool. Owning two towns? 
    Hey, that’s double the cool. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: But there is in-game 
    rewards for holding more than one town.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: There are in-game 
    rewards, yes. But it also requires more and more people to do so. One small 
    group of people might be able to take a town, they probably won’t be able 
    to hold it unless they start making alliances.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Would a group that 
    just holds one town suffer a significant disadvantage from a group that holds 
    several, 5 or 6 towns?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: It wouldn’t have anything 
    to do with the town vs town, it would have to do with in order to hold those 
    5 or 6 towns, the group would probably be much larger, and therefore they 
    would be a force to be reckoned with. It’s a very feudal system. It’s basically 
    in many ways mirroring feudal society. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brian Urbanek: A couple 
    of things you said you wanted to elaborate on; you said previously, the ranger 
    could be either a thief-ranger or a fighter-ranger. You’re not becoming the 
    same ranger. There are distinct differences from whether you go from a thief 
    to a ranger or a fighter to a ranger.  A ranger is always <i>this</i>, but 
    if you’re a fighter-ranger, you’re also this, and a thief-ranger, you’re also 
    this. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: So is it like different 
    abilities based on your character set?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BU: Additional beyond 
    the core of what a ranger is. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Like, say, a fighter-ranger 
    could wear better armor, for example.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: That’s exactly an 
    example, in fact. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: This is really complex. 
    Are you guys going to put this information out, or are you just going to put 
    the game out and let people figure it out?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BU: Our manuals are not 
    going to suck. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(laughter)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: I believe in letting 
    players do a lot of discovery. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: Discovery is nice, 
    but if you’ve got to spend so much time just figuring out the basics…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: There’s a difference 
    between having a learning curve, and having more things defineable. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: The key is, the basic 
    game is get in and start killing things, and enjoying the game itself. That’s 
    going to be really easy. You get in and start clicking a mouse. I don’t mind 
    a huge amount of information, as long as it’s given to me in little entertaining 
    doses over a long period of time. And of course the long period of time works 
    out with what we want – we’d love people to play over a long period of time. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: The interface looks 
    really clean.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: It’s completely customizable, 
    you can move everything, you can resize everything. I just dragged some of 
    my favorite icons off onto the screen and killed the entire ring interface. 
    Which is great, I just want the spells that I kick off a lot handy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: What hardware resolution 
    does the engine support?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: You can put it in 
    any resolution that the card can support. I don’t know if it’s going to stay 
    that way, but it doesn’t cause any problems right now. You can run it at any 
    res. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: What kind of frame 
    rate do you get with a standard, say, P3-300?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: We get about 30-35 
    frames per second, even with a bunch of characters on screen. We use a special 
    poly-reduction technology that helps a lot with that kind of thing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Is that kind of like 
    what Messiah was supposed to have?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Yes it is, but..</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BU: …ours actually works.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(laughter)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: One of the features 
    you guys have been talking about is the strategy layer behind it, what can 
    you tell us about it? How would it work basically? I assume this is how a 
    player would take over a town, for example. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: There’s a whole lot 
    of facets that come about, that comes about that isn’t like, oh, here’s the 
    code for diplomacy. We’re opening up a foundation for things that, we allow 
    to happen that hasn’t been done like this before. How much strategy will there 
    be? Well…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: I don’t mean how will 
    players use strategy in terms of in-game strategy, I assume you have formations 
    for organizing large armies, etc…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: This is a simple example. 
    We’ve got different formations that a person with that discipline can call 
    out. What’s the name of the discipline?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Commander.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: What are the benefits 
    for being in formation?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: It can actually have 
    an impact on the outcome of a battle. Mages in the back are safe from an initial 
    attack, then you actually are going to be protected.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: What’s to prevent the 
    archer players from just saying “Hey, I don’t want to go here”…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Nothing! They’re idiots! 
    Sorry, your buddies in your group were just idiots!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: When you call out 
    a formation, the default is people will start moving there. If someone says 
    nope, don’t wanna, and click somewhere else, they broke formation and take 
    off somewhere else. You don’t control them, you just give them an order. Whether 
    they follow it or not is up to them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Which is cool, I think 
    that’s the way it should be. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BU: As long as they’re 
    in formation, it’s like giving fighters cleric buffs. Your leadership cascades 
    out to them, they perform at a higher degree. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: As long as they remain 
    in formation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: And fighters have 
    a shield wall, if they do that then people cannot walk through them in strike 
    vs strike. With strong fighters in front, my mages will be a lot more protected. 
    So will my archers, whoever is behind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Virgil: What about communication?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: We are great on channels. 
    We are firm MUD players, we are firm believers in communication at all times. 
    You have tells, you have says, you have global channels, you have guild channels…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: You have channels 
    that can be routed to different windows and logged. They can be color coded.  
    The default is that chat windows get logged to disk.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: That’s a really cool 
    looking robe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: You like that? Thanks 
    a lot.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: If I had a dream 
    character, it would be a tailor who could make clothing like that type of 
    design.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: We are actually getting 
    very close to that type of design. Right now we just take the 3d object and 
    iconize it, use it to display on your character, download it to others, all 
    that’s required is that particular 3d object. That’s the closest I’ve ever 
    heard to people being able to actually create objects.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Technically we could, 
    with this game I wouldn’t. I’d make an invite-only game because otherwise 
    you’d have a whole lot of lewd pictures all over the place.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: Yeah, you would.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: That’s why we don’t 
    allow people to upload their own shield crest right now, because we can’t 
    trust that people won’t upload  random pictures of MC Hammer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: It’s sad.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: I think I’d have more 
    problems with running into MC Hammer then a naked woman.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: We can let people 
    customize their client all they want, because it’s for them only. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: How is the plot in 
    Shadowbane handled? Do you have an overarching storyline?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Yes. We also have 
    feature characters. We hire roleplayers who are actors to basically play roles 
    in the game. Range anywhere from if I have a GM run city, I might have a noble 
    to run it, hire someone to play and basically cause political strife and intrigue 
    in that city, all the way to demigods.  So someone would show up like Ares 
    shows up on Hercules. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: Do you have a pre-written 
    storyline already that you’re planning on running with?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: We have the basic 
    outline of what the story’s going to be, but one of our goals is between now 
    and release to set up what we call the storyboard. It’s going to be a group 
    of individuals, kind of like a writing staff of a TV show, who basically build 
    scripts and pass them out to their actors and say, here’s what’s going to 
    happen over the next month. It’s a little bit more open then that, because 
    the players are going to dictate it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="sb6.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="left">L: 
    So players could be part of the storyline.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Absolutely. That’s 
    the goal. But we certainly can’t provide enough feature characters that every 
    player will have their own individual mentor hired by our company. So instead 
    what we are doing is engineering it that our feature characters work at the 
    guild level, and it has a trickle-down effect. So let’s say I’m a god of thunder, 
    and I show up at a city that built a temple to the god of thunder, and I say 
    there’s an artifact lost in the Northlands. You must find it and bring it 
    to me. At the same time there’s the god of deception and the god of wind saying 
    the same thing…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JN: Or you need to block 
    someone from taking this artifact.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Now I’ve got a quest. 
    Obviously they can’t all succeed, but it’ll be a lot of fun seeing how it 
    turns out.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LoH: How many faces, different 
    looks do you have?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JH: We have a base face 
    for each race, and we have skin tones and textures based on that race. Then 
    hair color, hair type, facial hair, etc. So it’s a base face but then you 
    have all sorts of customizability with that. Aracoix have different beaks 
    they can put on, that’s another thing we haven’t really talked about…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Those are birdmen, 
    we have other different races…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L: I noticed on your website 
    some races were listed “restricted”. What does that mean?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TC: Can’t tell you that 
    yet. Sorry. You can tell the good questioners because I have to answer that 
    several times. </font></p>
