<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">A
mud is not a mud unless you are in the world the mud represents. In other words,
there must be a proxy for you, the user, extant in the simulation. The key
factor in considering avatar representation in the space is that the method of
representation is completely irrelevant, just as it was with maps. Again,
however, there are many ways to accomplish this representation, and they all
have differing advantages and disadvantages.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
general term for this proxy in virtual reality circles is avatar. However, muds
tend to call them characters, which reflects the gaming heritage of the mud
world. The term “character” is derived from the pen-and-paper role-playing
games typified by the progenitor of the genre, Dungeons and Dragons. In a
roleplaying game system (henceforth RPG), a character is essentially your
playing piece as well as your proxy in the game: it is a constellation of
statistics and data that represent a human (or humanoid, at any rate) walking
around in the game setting.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">It
is fruitful to make a distinction between those elements of this definition that
are aspects of game mechanics—let’s call them tangible attributes—and
those that are not. An RPG character is defined by a set of numbers on an
arbitrary scale. These numbers represent attributes such as strength, dexterity,
intelligence, and so on. The attributes listed are generally abstractions,
generalizations that represent multiple types of characteristics about a
character, but they have direct impact on the operation of specific game rules
on that character. For example, the definition of the attribute of Intelligence
in the first edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rules reads:
&quot;Intelligence is quite similar to what is currently known an intelligence
quotient, but it also includes mnemonic ability, reasoning, and learning ability
outside of those measured by the written word. Intelligence dictates the number
of languages in which the character is able to converse. Moreover, intelligence
is the forte of magic-users, for they must be perspicacious in order to
correctly understand and memorize spells...&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We can think of this type of character definition as essentially
establishing tangible facts about a character—tangible in that they affect the
way in which the “laws of physics” of a game, the nature of the virtual
reality, operates when interacting with a character.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">However,
there is a whole other dimension to a character, one that the laws of physics of
the world generally ignore. These are intangible to the game’s rules, though
they are often not intangible at all in the real world. Examples include
physical appearance, temperament, talents, etc. RPGs have not ignored these
attributes of a character: even in the first edition of AD&amp;D, there was a
“charisma” statistic, and later editions added a “comeliness” statistic
as well. As RPGs developed, they began to attempt to simulate more of these
aspects of a character using the same statistics systems that they represented
other aspects of the game with. Generally speaking these were failures because
they didn’t have direct applicability to the game physics. As an example,
charisma and comeliness were most useful for very limited applications within
the game rules, dealing with the recruitment and management of characters
controlled by the “dungeon master” (the guy pulling the strings in the
fictional setting—essentially, God to the gamer). As many gaming sessions had
no use of this particular moderately obscure subsection of the rules, these
statistics were useless and generally ignored. As a result, the player’s
ability to communicate and to persuade acquired greater importance than the
supposed appearance and eloquence of his character.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">So
What is Role-playing?<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">One
can think of the elements of a character as acting as a filter on the player. In
an ideal situation, the actions that the player can take are limited by the
actions that are within the capabilities of the character (as defined by the
statistics), and the information received by the player is dictated by the
perceptual abilities of the character (again, defined by the statistics). At the
same time, one can profitably think of the character as a mask the player wears
when participating in the game. Further, one can think of the range of possible
characters, and character archetypes, as modes of expression for a player,
merely different ways to express oneself in that they offer subtly different
media for communicating to others participating in the shared fiction.<o:p>
</o:p>

</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">To
give a concrete example, consider the two following sentences:<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">This
world is boring to me!<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>

suffer from ennui.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
semantic content of these two is virtually identical, but we perceive them
through different linguistic filters, resulting in different impressions of the
speaker. The latter is languid, passive, probably educated, and even has a whiff
of self-indulgence. The former is angry, desirous of taking action, perhaps a
little frustrated.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
effect is increased if we add visual elements to what was written:<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">This

suffer from ennui. (pretty handwriting)<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
tonal differences resulting from the typeface are immediate.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">A
similar effect occurs with characters. They are in many ways the typeface used
by the user to communicate and interact with the rest of the virtual world (be
it the in-the-head virtual space inhabited by the players of a pen-and-paper
RPG, or a mud’s virtual space). The outward appearance of the character (how
it is perceived by other participants) is one element here; the filtering of
actions and perceptions by the character’s defined statistics is another. To
push our typeface analogy even further, the tangible statistics are the
typeface, in that it is something that everyone can refer to. The choice of
words, however, is still the player’s, and reflects the intangibles.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">“Role-playing”
is essentially the process of acting in a defined role whilst playing one of
these games. “Role acting” is perhaps a better term since the term
role-playing has been corrupted by a focus on character advancement, which is to
say the game mechanic of upgrading a character’s statistics and abilities over
time. In a very fundamental way, good role-playing is getting the words spoken
and the typeface in which they are spoken to match up. Just as<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I

</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">is
jarring and bizarre, so is forcing your character to take actions which either
his tangible and intangible attributes render implausible or impossible within
the setting’s laws of reality. In other words, suffering ennui in that
typeface is bad role-playing.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Why
does this matter to virtual world design? Because the laws of physics in a
virtual world are far more rigid than the ones in a pen and paper RPG. There is
no human mediating the effect of these laws and changing reality at a whim. In
role-playing circles, the mark of a good game master is considered to be his
ability to add and drop laws of physics in service of the narrative events in
his world. The actions he takes serve the story and the enjoyment of his fellow
players. A game master who obeys the strict laws of physics defined by the
rulebook would quickly find his game to be unfun (and therefore without
players). <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In
the virtual world, the game master is the computer, and it has no such agenda.
And this makes the nature of characters—henceforth termed avatars—even more
critical. Everything the user sees and does is shaped by his avatar—it is his
filter on the events that come from the server, and it is his mode of expression
within the virtual world. And whereas in a pen and paper gaming session the
other players are aware of the true characteristics of a player because the
player typically expresses himself as himself, merely choosing to conform to
things that the character might do; in a virtual setting, the other participants
only perceive the mask. The actions they see are only what the character does.
For them, the other player is the avatar.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Identity</span></font></b><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">This
brings about the issue of identity. A player’s online identity is largely a
result of the intangibles, not the tangibles. If the player is not a careful
role-player, what will happen is that the intangibles that leak through (such as
eloquence, prejudices, moods, analytical ability, leadership, etc) will be
completely unrelated to and unaffected by the formal definition of his identity
within the virtual space, which is concerned only with the tangible elements
such as statistics. Thus we get the phenomenon of the character with supposedly
low intelligence who is the leader of his peer group.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
way to think of it is that the mud server relates to a user based on the
tangible statistics, because they are database entries. And other players relate
to the user on the basis of the intangible attributes. But these intangible
attributes are not exactly the intangible attributes of the actual human behind
the mask—rather, they are filtered intangibles that are modified both
consciously and unconsciously by the user based on the inputs he receives from
the server and based on the nature of his online identity.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">This
is a heavy burden for an avatar to carry. Fortunately, avatars are iconic and
not representational. And this means that they can carry a much heavier semantic
burden. In Scott McCloud’s seminal book Understanding Comics, he defines
cartooning as “amplification through simplification.” What he is getting at
is selectively picking elements of a picture to concentrate on and make more
important—like, perhaps, the way in which we select intelligence, strength,
dexterity, and other such attributes to serve as an abstraction of a person in
an RPG. He also says,<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">&quot;When
two people interact, they usually look directly at one another, seeing their
partner’s features in vivid detail. Each one also sustains a constant
awareness of his or her own face, but this mind-picture is not nearly so vivid;
a sketchy arrangement... a sense of shape... a sense of general placement.
Something as simple and basic as a cartoon.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">He
goes on to note that the only thing more abstracted is text itself.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
implications for the avatar are clear. In the virtual world, what we are seeing
is the cartoon selves of different individuals interacting directly. McCloud
says, “Icons demand our participation in order to make them work. There is no
life here except that which you give to it.” The process of fleshing out the
reality of an icon, McCloud terms “closure.” Media which depend on this sort
of thing were termed “cool” media by Marshall McLuhan—comics is one such,
and television is another. A virtual space, because of its interactivity, of
course cannot fall into the same category, but it is interesting to see that one
aspect of virtual worlds, at least, can be regarded that way. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">In
order to identify with an avatar in virtual space, we must make a very large
leap of “closure.” However, the amount of closure required has been reduced
over time as the tangible qualities of avatars expanded. This is complicated by
the fact that the filtering performed by avatars is still very imperfect: just
as in the paper RPGs, the player’s personal abilities to communicate and lead
are more important than the alleged abilities of the avatar that represents him.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">An
interesting possible extrapolation of McCloud’s commentary is that it may very
well be the fact that the typical virtual world avatar is an abstraction that
makes them so easy to identify with. They serve as a direct projection of our
unconscious selves in that like that self, they are a “cartoon” in
McCloud’s terminology. This makes them extremely easy to identify with. This
argues in favor of reducing the realism of our avatar portrayals as we design
these environments, if we wish to have tighter identification. Interestingly,
social spaces are those with the least definition to their avatars. They have a
much higher proportion of intangible avatar characteristics, and correspondingly
less world physics to relate to. At the simplest end of this scale lies The
Palace, the project with which Randy Farmer and Chip Morningstar of Electric
Communities followed up Habitat. This mud uses a simple room-based model, with
only a backdrop screenshot and little sense of spatiality to convey the
“location.” And avatars themselves range from full cartoon bodies to
essentially disembodied cartoon heads, floating against this backdrop, speaking
in comic-book bubbles.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">In
a similar vein we see The Realm, originally developed by Sierra. Its side view,
shared by BSX muds, Habitat, and The Palace, deliberately invokes a comic book
in its imagery and artistic style. The player in the figures on this page went
on to play Ultima Online, where the greater realism of the artwork no doubt
prevented her from finding as good a representation of herself.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">[artwork
not included yet]</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Of
course, even this representation of Janey isn’t really the way she is
generally perceived in the game: Ultima Online offered a higher-detail version
of the character and the regular version, which is what most people could see.
And this version looks much more like a cartoon again, as most of the detail is
lost, including (most crucially) facial features.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In
a more realistic environment, like Asheron’s Call, not only do facial features
follow “heritage groups” (meaning, you can get Asiatic features, or
Caucasian, and so on) but you can pick from an assortment of eyes, noses,
mouths, and so on. This allows you to more carefully craft something that
mirrors your mental image of your avatar, but also may result in removing some
of that iconic quality in characters.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
flip side of the coin in all of this, of course, is whether the iconic nature of
the other avatars in the space makes them easier to objectify, or easier to
empathize with. In general, the more cartoony spaces tend to have less problems
with antisocial behavior, but that may result from self-selection of the
participants, rather than any effect of the artwork. This remains as a
potentially fruitful area of research.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">It
is a major mistake to minimize the importance of identity in your virtual space.
It is also a mistake to assume that it can serve to tie a given player to your
space (say, perhaps, for the purposes of charging an ongoing fee). Your
environment offers an opportunity to incarnate in bits and bytes a persona that
the player normally has only in their mind. But it is almost certain to be an
incomplete mapping. The primary persona is and will always be the one visualized
in the player’s head. As a result, it is eminently portable from world to
world. There are countless incidents of role-players carrying a given character,
complete with name, behavior, and even similar tangible attributes, from game to
game, over the course of as many as twenty years. The characters will not ever
map perfectly, but they map as well as they ever do, since any mapping
whatsoever fails to match the vividness of the conception in the player’s
head.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">That
said, it is a wise thing to offer as wide a range as you can of means to
reinforce an avatar’s identity, because it increases the chances of a player
finding a mapping for the persona they wish to present. In addition, playing
dress-up with a miniature doll is just plain fun, for either gender (though the
men may choose not to admit it) and the more choices you offer for avatar
identity, the more you can offer that fun. It is no accident that Ultima Online
and other games have termed the avatar customization window the “paperdoll.”<o:p>

</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In
its most primitive form, an avatar is just a handle, or “nick” to use IRC
terminology. In other words, just a name. The name is in fact one of the first
elements to be removed from avatars when designers of muds start getting more
creative. Many muds, when they evolve out of standard codebases, start replacing
the standard descriptions of people:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>John is here.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">with
more descriptive tags based on physical characteristics:<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A tall dark man with horrible scars is here.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">This
then requires the observing player to either recognize the description and tie
it to a name, or to examine the player more closely in order to ascertain the
name. Some proposed designs go even further, allowing all names perceived by a
player to be completely relative and arbitrary. Under such a system, we have no
global namespace—a given name is in the perceiver’s eyes. Global namespace
is a term ripped from programming, of course. However, it has interesting and
special characteristics for mud design. Whereas one player might see:<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>John has arrived from the west.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">another
might have encountered John before and stored a custom tag for him, resulting in
output like:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The jerk who tried to hit on me has arrived from the west.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">This
has interesting possibilities for the future, when it is likely that the large
scale of online communities will demand “tickler files” of similar design,
though likely without losing the global namespace.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Unique
names are another issue related to the global namespace. Most muds actually
store individual player’s data files indexed off the name. Thus, the
requirement for unique names arises from a basic architectural decision in the
server. They serve as invaluable tracking tools for the mud admin and also for
other players—in fact, arguably they are more important to the other players
than to the admin, because admins generally have other methods of identifying a
particular player. Much of the communications infrastructure of a typical mud
relies on unique names; when you need to send a message to a player remotely,
the means for doing so is to send it to the unique tag you have for them: their
name.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Constancy
in names is vital to players for more than interface reasons. Without it, there
can be no semblance whatsoever of social transmission of information regarding
the behavior of fellow avatars. Without this reputation-based curb on behavior,
avatars are likely to run amok. The stigmata of violating social codes falls
away if true anonymity is available. Hence many thinkers in the field refer to
the threshold as being pseudonymity. This is similar to a handle on CB radio:
nobody may know your real name, but you are sufficiently tied to the handle you
use that it can establish a reputation of its own, and you can come to value it
as much as you value your name in the real world. And indeed, one can see the
instances of pseudonymity having taken root in players’ minds when they make
statements like, “I’d like to try out that new game, but if I can’t have
my name in it, then I’m not going to play.”<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Clearly,
conflicting desires here lead to both the need for unique names and also the
imperative of letting players choose the pseudonym that suits them. The only
major mud to ever launch without unique names was Ultima Online. As a result, it
also lacked effective in-game communication tools, and problems with
impersonation of other players ran rampant. At the same time, large-scale muds
(and in fact, any large scale system with unique names, such as America Online)
run out of plausible names extremely quickly—this was the reason why UO made
the choice it did. Inability to obtain a particular handle upon first login is
often cited by players as a reason for not staying on that mud. There are well
under 5,000 names in common usage in the English language, and even the addition
of fantasy names does not account for enough handles to cover a player base of
over 100,000. EverQuest handled this by creating a random name generator that
simply used syllable combination to generate gibberish; the results were far
from satisfying and failed to meet the best test of a name: strong mnemonic
identification. Another frequently suggested solution to the problem is to allow
duplicate names but expose some sort of unique identifying number or code for
every player to the populace at large. This also fails the mnemonic test, of
course, but doesn’t preclude multiple “John Smiths.” A better solution
would involve breaking down a name into components, such as first name, surname,
place of origin, and other such identifying characteristics. Thus there could be
countless Johns, and even many John Smiths, but only one John Smith of Avalon.<o:p>

and Appearances</span></font></b><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The
other standard piece of information making up an avatar’s identity is their
description or appearance. Depending on the system used for displaying the
environment, the physical description of the avatar may be textual or graphical.
In addition, depending on the system, the avatar may also have optional material
(always textual) which can be entered in to describe their character in greater
detail. Players often make use of this to embellish upon the bare strokes that
the standard description allows.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
most interesting aspects of descriptions and this type of profile are the ways
players reveal themselves through them. The very first step is that of choosing
a gender.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Currently,
the player base of commercial graphical muds is over 90% male. However, the
gender breakdown of avatars within the game shows a far higher percentage of
female avatars. Similarly, the population of text muds in general shows that the
majority of those who play are in fact male, but that the amount of
female-presenting characters can approach 50%, depending on the nature of the
game played.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">In
general, female players tend to be attracted to the more social spaces, whereas
the goal-oriented systems tend to be predominantly male. However, in both
spaces, numerous males choose to play female-presenting avatars—enough of
them, in fact, that it’s a standard joke in mudding circles that odds are good
that your netsex partner was a fourteen year old boy, regardless of what gender
you are and regardless of what genders you presented to one another via your
avatars.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">There
are basically three reasons given for this behavior. One is a particularly
pragmatic reason: female-presenting players tend to get special treatment in
muds, perhaps because the vast majority of the players behind the masks are
actually males. The female characters tend to get assistance more quickly than
males in dealing with the tribulations of being a newbie, and they tend to be
given gifts of equipment and items. While they tend to get sexually harassed and
propositioned at an alarming rate, by and large, they have a smoother online
experience than those who are male-presenting. To this end, many of the most
blatantly female characters are often playing up the supposedly feminine
behavior with the explicit intent of getting favors and stuff. Conversely, many
females choose to present as males in order to avoid the sexual harassment.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
second reason often advanced is simply “to see what it’s like on the other
side.” It’s hard to quarrel with this, nor is it worth the time to
investigate the psychology behind this motive. Players who give this reason
often report a sense of liberation with playing the opposite sex, of freedom
from traditional expectations and gender roles. Others report greater insight
into the opposite gender as a result of having experienced life “in the other
person’s shoes.” The gender identification with one’s character can become
so complete that male players report having become angered at being forced to
wear overly revealing clothing on their avatars (feeling the sting of sexual
objectification), and female players report having fallen into stereotypical
demonstrations of machismo, acting protective of female-presenting avatars even
when knowing their gender to be male, etc.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
third reason is the most banal of all: to entice someone into tinysex, only to
publicly post logs of the deed in order to embarrass them.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The
curious thing about gender in cyberspace is that it is both inescapable, and
oddly fluid. It is generally easy to tell who is the male playing at being
female when they start out, because they are often too crude or too direct and
too sexual when dealing with other players. But an experienced cross-gender
role-player can and will fool players of both genders without great difficulty,
precisely by acting more like the gender that they are presenting than like a
panting teen in the throes of hormonal flux. The result is that while avatars
are generally strongly gendered, and presented sexuality is extremely important
for social interaction, it may not correspond to the gender of the actual
player.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">An
interesting outcrop of this is the way in which female and male players choose
to present their avatars. Regardless of whether they are playing across genders,
the choices follow patterns. The female avatars are largely beautiful, or
mysterious, or impish, or plucky, or in general appealing. You very rarely see,
regardless of the gender of the player, an overweight, or dull, or unappealing
female. Similarly, the male characters tend to either be noble, or roguish, or
mysteriously scarred, etc. The presentations are uniformly, regardless of player
gender, sexually attractive. However, within this very narrow range of actual
human appearance, there is still tremendous variety presented. Certainly the
appeal of presenting a beautiful female avatar to the world is likely different
for the male and the female player, but nonetheless, avatars designed by each
tend to be similar in that way.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">On
many systems, a somewhat less popular third alternative to the standard genders
exists: the gender-neutral character. Anecdotally, most neuter characters are
played by females, presumably for reasons similar to why they would choose to
play a male character; however, supposedly male characters play them far less
frequently. No major commercial systems thus far have allowed gender-neutral
presentation within the context of a generally gender-aware system; however,
several chat spaces, such as the original incarnation of The Palace and the 3d
environment WorldsChat, have offered systems wherein the avatars were much more
iconic, often being symbols, smiley faces, or anthropomorphic representations of
animals. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Of
course, anthropomorphic representations of animals have given rise to an entire
subtype of social space, commonly called “furry.” The original FurryMUCK is
infamous for both its animal-based avatars and for its general acceptance of
sexual activity between avatars—so much so that saying you visit a Furry game
is often considered to mean that you like anonymous netsex. The sole graphical
Furry world is Dr. Cat’s Furcadia, which is perhaps the most successful design
for a socially oriented space thus far. In a Furry environment, players choose
from a variety of animals to incarnate, with the various animals often
suggesting something about the character or nature of the player behind the
avatar. These critters are generally strongly gendered, rather than the animal
nature of the avatar taking prominence in the depiction. Again, it is avatar as
filter of experience and as mode of expression.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">A
similar artifact found in nearly all goal-oriented muds is the practice of
having avatar “races,” which are templates based on humanoid fantastical
races such as elves, dwarves, or various alien creatures. Selecting one of these
general humanoid fantastical races such as elves, dwarves, or various alien
creatures. Selecting one of these generally has an impact on your tangible
statistics, but also enriches the profile by carrying with is expected
behavioral patterns and certain restrictions in appearance. Races tend to be
extremely popular. A statistical survey at one website showed not only the usual
suspects in the top ten, but an astounding range of over 70 different races
available in a range of different muds.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In
examining descriptions (and in designing the systems that allow players to
create them) the primary thing to consider is how they allow the players to
express themselves. A player’s avatar is largely about wish-fulfillment in one
way or another, and the range of wishes they can fulfill is directly limited by
the author of the space. Much psychological hash can be made from the choices a
player makes in their descriptions, but we should not forget that people are
limited to the choices that the designer offers.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">When
interacting from behind the mask of a description, the things a player says are
inevitably shaped by the mask they wear. Given that the mask itself is an
expression of the player, what others perceive is not so much different from the
personality of the player as it is a refinement and exaggeration—hearkening
back to McCloud again, a cartoon. The natural disinhibition that occurs leads to
unvarnished truths being spoken and actions taken that would not otherwise have
occurred to the player. But these actions and words are still ineluctably part
of the player’s expression. Players wearing a mask reveal more of themselves,
not less. As Shakespeare put it, these avatars, our actors, are all
spirits—and like all spirits, they in some way represent an essence, and
therefore an essential part, of what we term our “selves.”<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Profile<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Identity,
of course, does not spring into being overnight. It accretes over time, layering
onto the original core notions of self, and is particularly shaped by what
others think of the person in question. So it is in virtual worlds as well: a
given avatar’s character evolves significantly over time, both because of
adapting to the possibilities the space presents, and because an avatar, like a
person in the real world, is very much shaped by other’s perceptions.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">In
cyberspace, this manifests as something termed the profile. Essentially, this is
a historical record of some sort that documents what the avatar has
done—perhaps even including elements from before the avatar began to actually
exist, fictionally added into the record to provide more of a context for their
actions. For example, a player of a World of Darkness MUSH likely ascribes a
fairly detailed background to their character, and makes this extended history
publicly viewable by anyone interacting with them so that others may know in
what ways to address them or respond to their presence in a manner that fits
with the total fictional immersion that is the goal of this sort of
role-playing-enforced space. In contrast, many systems may have nothing at all
for this, or may simply allow the player to insert this sort of background
material in their description.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Beyond
the player-entered history, there is also the tangible history of the avatar.
Depending on the system, this may be as much as a detailed list of deeds done
and significant accomplishments presented publicly, or as little as the level
they have achieved on some arbitrary game advancement ladder. It may even be as
little as a record of infractions kept by the administrators for the purpose of
determining when a given user needs to be ejected from the service.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">An
evolving user profile of this type is not only critical for being able to
maintain the service, but if publicly visible, serves as a powerful community
builder. Awards for good behavior, virtual pillorying of virtual criminals,
notable quests completed, and so on, all serve to reinforce the notion of
accountability for one’s actions, which in turn helps reduce the level of
sociopathic behavior online. Making the profile visible to others helps
innocents quickly identify troublemakers, and helps new arrivals quickly find
role-models.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">And
in many environments, the ability to interact with objects, carry them, and wear
them in a publicly visible fashion, has resulted in the term equipment being
applied to those aspects of an avatar’s profile which are acquired assets one
can remove at any time. Equipment is traditionally just a list of wear slots
(locations where items are worn) and the corresponding objects; even in
graphical systems, this convention is followed, but the display is usually done
by superimposing the images of the worn items onto the avatar’s body on a
paperdoll, thus extending the appearance. In that way, profile and description
serve to reinforce one another in the creation of identity.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">In
almost every system out there, a user’s profile includes tangible statistics
that drive the capabilities of the avatar. The commonest use of this is to turn
on a flag or reach a threshold on an advancement ladder which confers special
powers within the environment—essentially allows access to modify the laws of
physics of the game under which all avatars normally labor. There are various
terms for this type of avatar, most of them arising from the role-playing game
origins of muds: god, wizard, immortal, etc. Usually, this aspect of an
avatar’s profile is publicly visible unless the avatar is choosing to appear
incognito.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Other
uses for these tangible statistics that grant commands or capabilities are to
provide increased reward to players over time as they climb an advancement
ladder. Typical is the granting of new spells, skills, or access to new pieces
of equipment or items that they can make use of. It’s very common to see
“level” as a displayed element of an avatar’s profile. There are also
tangible statistics that serve to drive the avatar’s interaction with the game
rules, such as attributes for intelligence or strength. These also, typically
evolve over time.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Perhaps
the most interesting type of evolving profile is the generic class of profiling
tools called reputation systems. These are systems whereby fellow users of the
space are granted the ability to add to the profile of any given user with whom
they have an interaction. Typically, when some transaction or interaction
occurs, each user has the ability to rate the behavior of the other party. The
cumulative totals of positive and negative interactions thus result in
easy-to-read ratings that anyone can use. Various auctioning systems on the
Internet such as eBay make extensive use of this practice, and Ultima Online
attempted to use it to curb antisocial behavior. The reason why this addition to
the profile is important is because of the inconstancy of communication in
virtual spaces—it’s far too hard to spread word of a malcontent or evildoer,
but reputation systems essentially leverage the avatar’s profile to do it for
you.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Profiles 
  often modify names, usually with the granting of titles. Group affiliations 
  should be a major part of an avatar’s profile, and the more facilities provided 
  by the virtual world to allow display of these affiliations, the better. There 
  have been many examples of users choosing to start an avatar over from scratch, 
  throwing away all advancement, just in order to insert their guild affiliation 
  or a family name in their avatar’s name because the game system did not support 
  a separate field for it.</font></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
