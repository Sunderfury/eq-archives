    with babe shots) was cut in half.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm home now, and my brain is 
    no longer throbbing from the sun, the beer and the blaring sounds of video 
    games.&nbsp; The whole event seems like a blur to me now, with only fragments 
    of memories remaining.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My friend Ryan and I went to 
      see Battlefield Earth, as I mentioned.&nbsp; I'm not going to review it 
      again.&nbsp; Just thinking of that movie makes me shudder uncontrollably.&nbsp; 
      I will never be able to walk into a movie theater again with the same level 
      of confidence I once did.&nbsp; If you must know about it, you can read 
      one review I posted <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum9/HTML/000144.html">here</a>.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enough of that.&nbsp; When you 
      take away the bimbos, the distractions and the hype, you're left with the 
      real reason for going....the games.&nbsp; With that in mind, I present the 
      first ever presentation of <b>The Bob Awards</b>.&nbsp; No statue or ribbon 
      is given, but some day in the future these awards will be the most cherished 
      by the gaming community.&nbsp; What are the standards?&nbsp; Well, it has 
      to be a game that doesn't make me want to vomit in a violent fashion.&nbsp; 
      Here we go.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font>

      can't begin to describe how good this game looks.&nbsp; If you want to know 
      what the next generation of MMORPGS is going to look like, this is it.&nbsp; 
      What makes it so good?&nbsp; First you have a development team with a real 
      love of their game.&nbsp; You could tell how much they loved showing this 
      off, and for good reason.&nbsp; The animation is absolutely beautiful.&nbsp; 
      The game looks deep, with a meaningful fiction and a wide selection of possible 
      skills.&nbsp; Here's an example.&nbsp; You can be a bureaucrat in this game, 
      designing missions for other players to accomplish.&nbsp; All you scheming 
      manipulators, listen up.&nbsp; This game might be for you.&nbsp; They also 
      planned out for housing, with every character being assigned an apartment 
      at the start of the game, with fancier accommodations available for a price.&nbsp; 
      The story line is going to run for 4 years, with the servers shut down after 
      that.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font>

      like you couldn't have guessed this one.&nbsp; The only other one that came 
      close to matching this one was Mechcommander 2.&nbsp; If you even had a 
      mild interest in the previous Warcraft games, you MUST pick this one up.&nbsp; 
      I spent more time playing this one than any other game.&nbsp; The orcs are 
      just as much fun to play as ever.&nbsp; At first this was conceived as more 
      of a role-playing game, but since they re-tooled it, it's closer to it's 
      roots than ever before.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font>

      Verant St. Louis comes this promising little game.&nbsp; Now, I'm a bit 
      biased, since I used to love Empire years and years ago.&nbsp; This game 
      is pretty similar.&nbsp; You start off as an engineer, produce resources 
      and build a city.&nbsp; You make troops, set up defense perimeters and crush 
      your enemies.&nbsp; Each world will hold 500 players at a time, with a maximum 
      of over 4,000 cities total.&nbsp; It's real time, and it looks fun.&nbsp; 
      Don't expect to be blown away by the graphics, but expect solid game play 
      for all you armchair generals out there.&nbsp; Verant is shooting for December 
      of 2000, but the programer I talked to didn't think that was really going 
      to happen.&nbsp; It looks like it's worth the wait.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="noble.jpg" width="200" height="150" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="left">Ripcord 
      is publishing this little number.&nbsp; The shame of it is that we'll most 
      likely never get a chance to play it.&nbsp; Here's why I liked it.&nbsp; 
      We've seen a number of really great games over the years that put you in 
      the cockpit of a space fighter.&nbsp; Independence War tried to put you 
      in command of a larger ship, but it still played like a fighter sim.&nbsp; 
      This game is different.&nbsp; The command interface is simple to use, let 
      it still gives you a good level of strategic and tactical control.&nbsp; 
      The game itself will be similar to Privateer, with an open ended story line 
      and a good economic system of trade.&nbsp; The big problem?&nbsp; It most 
      likely will never get released.&nbsp; Ripcord got fed up with the first 
      developer, and now is trying to farm out bits and pieces to different shops....including 
      one in Indonesia.&nbsp; Damn shame.&nbsp; Graphics looked good and the game 
      was a great deal of fun to play.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font>

      I doubt it will actually ship in 3 weeks, the game looks great.&nbsp; The 
      animation is smooth, the controls intuitive and you can't go wrong with 
      vampires.&nbsp; Well, that's not true.&nbsp; Anybody recall the bad TV show 
      on FOX they based on this franchise?&nbsp; Well, this game doesn't screw 
      things up.&nbsp; The gameplay, in single player mode, looks like a great 
      deal of fun, and the possibility of making games in Story Teller mode seem 
      very promising.&nbsp; This game may have a long life to it.&nbsp; One word 
      of warning though, if you had problem making Quake mods, you might not feel 
      comfortable with the Storyteller tools.&nbsp; Storytellers who get to know 
      the tools will find a very powerful world creation system in place.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font>

      About But Now Convinced: Ultima Worlds Online Origin</font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="uo2b.jpg" width="200" height="143" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">So 
      I was watching a commercial on television where the tag line was "ever get 
      the feeling some people just stopped trying?"&nbsp; I was feeling this way 
      about UO2.&nbsp; No housing, no ridable mounts, NO GUILDS!!&nbsp; I spent 
      a half hour with the team looking the game over, and now I'm sold.&nbsp; 
      They're not going to revolutionize gaming with this product, but unlike 
      UO that's not their goal.&nbsp; It's going to be stable, good looking, and 
      relatively bug free by the time it ships.&nbsp; Will that be enough?&nbsp; 
      Well, the game looks great and you can tell they put a great deal of thought 
      into it.&nbsp; They have more people working on this game than any other 
      MMORPG, and an infrastructure that can support it.&nbsp; I'm not sure, yet, 
      if I'll be spending a great deal of time in this world, but I'm beginning 
      to have some faith that the team knows what they're doing.</font><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></i>

      first ever Bob awards.&nbsp; Tomorrow, I'll wrap up my E3 coverage with 
      a look at the aftermath, pictures of apes eating a sandwich and some final 
      thoughts.&nbsp; Not much more left.&nbsp; Now I'm off to sleep in my own 
      bed, and actually spend some time with the woman in my home who claims to 
      be my wife.</font> <br>
