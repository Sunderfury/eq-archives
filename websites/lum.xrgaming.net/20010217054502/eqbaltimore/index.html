<p><font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size="2">I arrived early.
Officially, registration did not begin until 1pm Friday afternoon. By 12:45
there were more people in the lobby of the BWI Marriott than you could shake a
stick at. And about fifteen of them could really use a good stick shaking. </font></b><font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size="2">Imagine
five hundred people leaning against the walls and wondering if they all know one
another, and in some cases, <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/eqbaltimore/cowboy.jpg">praying desperately they do not</a>.
Because I had the worlds most powerful hat with me, a few folks approached and
said hello. One of them knew who I was, but the rest just assumed that I was an
EQ player and one of the &quot;cool ones&quot;. I made the mistake of asking one
of them what <i>shard</i> they play on. The room hushed and turned like an E. F.
Hutton commercial.</font></p>
<b><p><font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size="2">Shortly after I
saw my first &quot;Got SoW?&quot; T-shirt, someone explained to me what it
meant. I did that &quot;I don't really get the joke, but I can see how it is
funny&quot; laugh. By the time the five hundredth person walked up and pointed
it out to me, I just resigned myself to, &quot;I don't play EQ.&quot;</font></b><font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size="2">
I realized that while this community has a great deal of over-lapping and has no
solid boundary lines, we are not one single group of people. We are, at best, a
jibber-jabbering assembly of sub-communities, all wandering around the Tower of
Babel trying to figure out just what the hell all the other groups are saying.
The SoW joke wasn't in my joke book, and &quot;vendor buy me some guards so I
can bank and sell&quot; was no funnier for them. Interesting to point out here,
I finally got to see exactly how nerdy all of us were at the UO Faire when we
joked about lagging and losing connection while standing in line to register.
For the love of God people, we are only <b>one feature film away</b> from being
&quot;Trekkies&quot; - please stop with the lagstorm/SoW jokes before the real
world hears you!</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size="2"><b>I cannot even
remember how many people asked me to compare my EQ Fan Faire experience with
last year's UO Faire.</b> I didn't want to get into that for one important
reason: At the UO Faire, I was only looking for about 35 to 40 people who I had
met and bonded with in the years I had played Ultima Online - so the event could
have been held in the back booth of a Denny's and I would have had a great time.
At the EQ Fan Faire, I was looking for three people, and one of them was
Delusion, so you can see why I wouldn't be looking forward to this event as
much. Having said that, I'll give this very short comparison and say no more
about it: the EQ Faire was basically a half-day event whereas the UO Faire was
two solid days. However, Verant made the best of the half-day they planned, and
had several contests and &quot;live quests&quot; (translation: pop quizzes about
the game) for players to join in and compete for cool stuff. The absolute
walk-away winner in the &quot;phat lewts&quot; is EQ, who awarded six or seven
players with a <b>unique in-game item</b> for their characters. When I mentioned
this to some OSI staffers last year, they ran for their lives into Vault 13 and
sealed the door behind them.</font>

the hat was not the most outrageous thing at the hotel.</b> But you never heard
that from me. When I first saw &quot;Vinyl Cheerleader Elf Chick&quot;, I
thought I was back at the UO Faire, but she didn't offer to sell me any
stainless steel bearings. To be honest, I liked these outfits because they
weren't so completely over the top, like say, if you were to take a <b>BUFFALO
PELVIS BONE AND WEAR IT ON YOUR FACE.</b> If you think that was a joke, go ahead
and ask someone who was there.. I refused to take my own picture of that guy for fear my
camera would burst into blue and green hellfire.</font><p><font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size="2">Yes
I know - I took a picture of a guy wearing a paper toilet napkin on his head.
Let's just say it was an interesting faire and move on to the next page in my
