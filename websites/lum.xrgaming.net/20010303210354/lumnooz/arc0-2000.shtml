Just got word of this from Dread Lord Calandryll. All you folks who've bought houses may want to check this out. All you folks who've been using bugs to plop houses anywhere REALLY want to check this out.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Improperly Placed Houses<br><br>In the near future, modern houses that do not conform with the <a href="http://guide.uo.com/house_0.html">house placement rules</a> listed on the Ultima Online website will lose certain functionality, and may become subject to further restrictions in the future as well. While these houses will not be deleted, improperly placed houses will not have access to all of the features that other houses have. The exact nature of these restrictions will be posted at a later date and we recommend that you keep reading the Ultima Online website for more information. Modern houses placed using a bug, placed completely off of the ground, in illegal locations such as those placed on top of other buildings, on top of hedges or trees, and inside or blocking interest points (such as dungeons, graveyards, etc.) may still be subject to deletion. We reserve the right to delete any future houses placed using exploits or bugs.</font><br><br>Check the <a href="http://update.uo.com/fyi.html">UO website</a> for more information on this. Now, hopefully, we'll see some action from GMs on the more blatant housing placements as well.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000042.html">So that house on top of a tree might go away soon.</a></b><br><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem949220092,67115,"></a>

Got this via email:<p><font color="#77FF77">All I can say is this is my own personal nightmare (No pun intended) the appology I issued was genuine. All I can say to the people who are 'defending' me is please stop and stop now. What I did was against the rules that I agreed to almost a year and a half ago when I became a seer. I am happy and proud of the time I spent in the ranks of so many creative people.<p>To the people who have decided to attack Durga, Twilight and Tyrant in my name.... *sighs* all I can say is if you would like to attack them do NOT use my name to do so... please. The people in the interest department at Origin have enough problems and difficulties with out having to deal with this. The Seers and IGMs of Origin do their Damndest to help both the community and the people of ultima online, do not attack them for it... trust me it hurts... I know from experiance.<p>This is the last thing I wanted to do, leave my Legacy like this... in a month I will rank next to 'Saint' Senith and Darwin in the line up of idiots. Many of you will continue to bash both me and OSI... Many of you will attack each other... and even more of you will attack people at OSI individually... I just ask you that you do not use me or this 'incident' to do it and that you realize that I WAS wrong for what I did, I felt that it was the right thing to do at the time, in fact I sat looking at the screen for about 45 seconds before I hit the enter key to transfer the nightmare to my location.. I just sat there and thought to my self... Is this right, what will happen... at the time I thought it was right, with hindsight no way in hell I would have done it... not because of my loss of robes, not because of any of the various hurtfull messages people throw back at eachother, but because of how I disapointed Twilight and Nikademus, two people who stood by me when no one else did... two people who trusted me. I betrayed that trust, and I was removed from the seer program for it, and rightfully so.<p>The entire field of Volunteers from Counselors to Companions to Seers are there to help the players... They do their best and try their hardest to do the right thing and help everyone in their own special way with their own talents and responcibilities... I ask you, do not hurt them and do not look down upon them for it. They may not be able to help you the way you wish they would... but they have/will/do help the best they can every day, and I am proud to have been in their ranks for over 2 years.<p>One last thing, in durga's responce to all this she said that I frequently went OOC and should have been derobed for that alone... Well I will tell you this... and I will only say it once... I will admit and take responcibility for EVERYTHING I have ever done in my entire life In Game, Out of Game... you name it. But don't you EVER accuse me of doing something that I didn't do.<p>~Violin~ (\o/)<br>Former-Seer Narcissus (LS/ATL)</font><p>As a note, Durga did not make the note about Narcissus going OOC, that was me repeating the accusation someone else emailed to me. That read, in part:<p><font color="#FF77FF">Secondly, the seer was known to go OOC on several occasions. This in itself is grounds for expulsion from the seer program. His most memorable quote is "wft are u calling me a pk?" when being taunted (In character) by one of the evil characters he'd helped kill. There were reports that his supervisors were unhappy with him as well for such occurances and he was likely to have been booted from the program regardless. He shouldn't have been kicked for saving those nightmares. He should have been kicked for his tendancy to go OOC.</font><p>Not being there, I can't judge, but in general it seems Narcissus was not very well liked in the Atlantic PvP community. Yet another example of the divide between "PKers" and "roleplayers". *emotes deep sigh*<p><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000040.html">Let's totally drive this topic into the ground!</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem949190648,1562,"></a>

On our Very Special Not-kTalk Message Board, Durga, the head of OSI's Volunteer program left a short comment about the previous story involving a Seer on Atlantic who took matters into his own hands regarding an animal theif:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">As for the volunteer in question and the actions he took, Interest volunteers are told from Day One that they may not use their special powers and abilities for any action other than those for which they were trained, and in the advancement of a specific plot or event. This is emphasized during and after training, and each volunteer agrees to this condition prior to being certified. Using the powers other than in the proscribed manners is a guaranteed ticket to get dropped from the program and, if the action is serious enough, the potential loss of the account. Origin has absolutely *zero* tolerance for violations of this policy. Volunteers aren't there to enforce to the TOC or ROC; that is limited to Origin employees.</font><br><br>Others have wrote in about the Seer's actions, both that what the "exploiter" did is less an "exploit" then taking advantage of pet's brain dead AI (which Firedog mentioned on the <a href="http://www.unitedtamers.com/">United Tamer's</a> message board would be eventually resolved) and that the seer in question often went OOC (out of character) when confronted by hostility in game -- in the Seer program, staying In Character is the Prime Directive, and that alone would be grounds for his dismissal.<br><br>In any event, people actually trying to set up roleplaying events on Atlantic weren't helped by any of this, no matter how you look at it. Unless you're one of those mindless puds who see the UO world as divided between "PKs" and "rollplayers" and are laughing about how great it is that someone from the other side got caught.<br><br><b><a href="">The message thread in question</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem949120087,58345,"></a>

Two big patches being talked about tonight, one for UO and one for EQ.<br><br>The UO patch is still under development, but finally we are being promised <a href="http://update.uo.com/">Secure House and Pet trading</a>. While this won't totally eliminate the business of those who <a href="http://uo.tradespot.net/">profit</a> from the failings of UO's economic interface, it is a huge step forward in making the player economy truly self-sufficient.<br><br>EQ doesn't have a player economy. Instead it punishes players for choosing the wrong class. Woe betide those who chose Necromancers, as this week they got stuck with the harsh end of the nerfing wand. Included in an "emergency patch" tonight (claimed by a guide in EQ-chat to "catch and ban those who use EQ-Show" [sic]), was the previously discussed patch which gave magicians the ability to give their pets weapons just like necros.<br><br>Of course, they then turned around and removed the <b>reason anyone gives their pets weapons in the first place!</b> You see, the reason people gave their pets weapons was mainly to reduce the attack delay of their pets. For example, a high level Necro pet given fine steel daggers would see their delay drop from 30 to 19. Which is why Necro pets were so sought after -- until tonight, when that ability was nerfgunned away.<br><br>Of course they wouldn't want to just totally fuck Necromancers up the ass without a goodbye kiss, so Necro pets now cast minor lifetaps on their opponents. Since the Necro pet's damage went down <b>over 60%</b> as a result of this nerf, this doesn't help a whole lot.<br><br>So if you were hoping to get into high level groups with your necro because of it's pet, think again.<br><br>One game empowers its users, the other game cripples them. Of course, in UO Necromancy is just a cruel hoax, so feel free to keep bashing them, I guess. But if you thought that the removal of precasting was a horribly awful nerf, take a moment to pause and reflect upon your <br>brethren in That Other Game.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000037.html">Like I care about EQ.

Odd story found its way into my mailbox tonight.<br><br>Apparently Seer Narcissus of Atlantic happened upon some folks who were stealing nightmares using some kind of exploit. He used the limited powers seers have to remove the nightmares to whom he thought was the rightful owner. He was then either booted from or resigned from the Seer program and, according to others on Atlantic, the persons who had their nightmares taken by Narcissus were rewarded for turning the Seer in.<br><br>Admittedly all I know at this point is what has been posted publicly. I've asked a few people to comment on this and they all refused. Apparently the way that Origin is handling this has not been too popular among Atlantic's role-playing community.<br><br>At any rate, I'm sure many of you have your own version of events, so feel free to correct my many errors.<br><br><A href="http://www1.sitepowerup.com/mb/view.asp?Action=Reply&BoardID=115847&Reply=7">Seer Narcissus informing players that he no longer serves</a><br><a href="http://claudiaraym.netfirms.com/news.html">The "Claudia Raym" news page, with more opinion on the events</a><br><a href="http://www1.sitepowerup.com/mb/view.asp?Action=Reply&BoardID=114226&Reply=89">Message on "Atlantic Roleplaying Forum" calling for a public protest</a><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000040.html">Discuss your take on all this</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem949085313,38722,"></a>

The info for this update was pulled before he added that.) only to find this message on the main page:<br><br><font color="#00CC00">i realize i only spammed with 600k, and didn't fuck with anything yet - but i will. trust me. :) and no, there's nothing you can do to stop it. trust me on that one too.<br>of course, you AOLish faggity dialup users (90% of the visitors here) won't appreciate the 600k. that's ok with me, though, because that's not all you're going to hear from me. <br>btw, you're all queers. just in case you were buttfucking an forgot momentarily during you're fagasm.<br><br>later i'll be posting my nick.<br>(when i deface the entire site).<br>btw the reason you're all queers is:<br><li>ronald mcdonald: no one gives a fuck about ac except you and your fellow queers. those who do, won't for long. trust me. it sucks balls. like you. unfortunately your funniness has cut down to um, none. quit babbling. no one cares if you don't like some fuck in AC. no one cares what you have to say about nighthawk either. we know you're in a gay orgy irl, so stop fucking telling us. queer<br><br>nighthawk: you're a faggot. plain and simple. while warik, too, was somewhat of a dick, you added more to dickheadness: arrogance. you're not good. you're a dumbass. while i don't play uo anymore, i do know that you're a no-name (or were) and if you have a name now, it's undesereved. wanna know why? <b>because you're a queer</b>. btw, no one cares about boneyard OR ac. cuz they suck my balls, like you four.<br><br>greybeard: retire. thanks<br>.<br>warik: you, my friend, suck ass at cgi. and your host blows. a lot. somewhat like you. you suck. but, while you're a dick, you're the best of the four queers (not saying much - a queer is a queer, and btw you're one).<br>anyway.</font><br><br>All this followed by massive amounts of the oh so original phrase "AC Sucks" over and over and over again.<br><br>Folks, normally I wouldn't give attention grabbing idiots like this a mention, only to point out something.  People suck.  They really, really, really suck.  Now here at Lumcorp we've had our little spats with Ron, Grey and crew.  If we were all drunk at a bar, we would eventually pull out knives and go after each others throats.  But this...well, this is the reason why EVERYONE with a site on the internet eventually devlops an intense hatred of humanity directly proportionate to the number of total readers.  You people are fucking idiots who need to get a life.  Instead of pissing away the few brain cells you have on our message boards, or trying to impress us with your "l33t" hacking skills, why don't you just grow up, piss off and go away.  Get laid..not that a woman will have you.  Move out of your parents basement.  Just go away.  As for the idiot who did this...well, the WTFman folks are nothing if not vindictive bastards.  As you're sitting in jail, waiting for mommy to bail you out, I hope you remember that...untill your prison buddy gets tired of useing you as his bitch and decides to just skull fuck your fat pathetic face instead.<br><br>I hate all of you.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000035.html">Give me another reason to hate.

Now it's time to seperate the men from the boys, the wheat from the chaff, the puppies from the...well, whatever one seperates puppies from.  Strap yourselves in as we dig deeper into the "Big Book of Raph" and look at some more things he brought to the table.<br><br>Before we begin though, Raph was kind enough to point out a mistake in the first part of this little essay.  The law "Looking at what parts of your game players tend to automate is a good way to determine which parts of the game are tedious and/or not fun." was indeed added *after* his experience with UO.  As he stated <font color="#00CC00">"The Laws are a living document that has been evolving since before UO shipped to well after."</font> How would he do things today?  Well, I guess we'll have to wait untill we find out his mysterious next project...which I can only assume is an Massivly Multiplayer Online version of Frogger unless someone on the inside is willing to tell me different.<br><br>Anyways, on with Raphs rules...nd how the big three stack up to 'em.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">If you write a static story (or indeed include any static element) in your game, everyone in the world will know how it ends in a matter of days. Mathematically, it is not possible for a design team to create stories fast enough to supply everyone playing. This is the traditional approach to this sort of game nonetheless. You can try a sim-style game which doesn't supply stories but instead supplies freedom to make them. This is a lot harder and arguably has never been done successfully.</font><br><br><b>UO and EQ:</b> Let us accept for the minute this is true.  Does this mean that it's not even worth trying?  Well, EQ and UO would have you believe this is true.  We've seen some good steps recently by UO to buck the trend, but no matter how many uncorruptable seers you have, we're still on our own when it comes to enterntaining ourselves.   Is this law true though?  Well, AC doesn't think so....<br><br><b>AC:</b> They think different.  They think they can do it. Of course there are people who believe you can levitate.  Those people wind up hopping up and down on their ass.  AC seems bent on giving it the old college try.  Let's wait untill after they hurt their ass before we pass judgement.<br><br>It's possible that technology and really good bots will be able to provide players, someday, with stories.  Not today though.  The much touted quest engine in EQ turned out to be nothing more than a good way for folks to camp for l33t goodies.  If a quest engine ever went into UO, expect more of the same.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">The expectations are higher than of similar actions in the real world. For example: players will expect all labor to result in profit; they will expect life to be fair; they will expect to be protected from aggression before the fact, and not just to seek redress after the fact; they will expect problems to be resolved quickly; they will expect that their integrity will be assumed to be beyond reproach; in other words, they will expect too much, and you will not be able to supply it all. The trick is to manage the expectations</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> Just get players used to the response of "I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do to help you." and you're problem is solved.  Actually, that's just harsh and more than a bit unfair...although for a monent I caught Myschef nodding her head.  Raph was talking about more than player grievences.  He was talkiung about the whole big picture.  A carpenter expects that his hour of work will wield the same profit as the hours work of a blacksmith...and in a virtual world, why not?  In the arena of "fairness" in skills UO has had it's sucess and it's faliures.  UO has also paid attention to the grivences of all groups.  They haven't done too badly.  We can tell because everyone in UO thinks the dev team is out to get them.  A fair compromise is where both sides walk away from the table unhappy.  In regards to resolving complaints...well, it's a long road ahead to repair the damage.  Will faith be restored in the GM program?  We'll see...we'll see.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> If EQ has a greater flaw than security, it would be in the intrest of "fairness."  From a combat system that is unfair to all except Rangers to a blatant disregard to the complaints of the community, EQ has it all.  In EQ you are not rewarded for any labor except camping.  The trade skills are little more than ways to spend money wihtout reward.  Even in upholding the rules, the one thing that can be said about EQ GMs is that they make UO look good.<br><br><b>AC:</b> The new kid on the block allways has it the easiest.  EQ was once reknowned for listening to the players and for good support.  Will life in AC be "fair" for the players?  Ask me in a few months.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">Online game economies are hard.  A faucet->drain economy is one where you spawn new stuff, let it pool in the "sink" that is the game, and then have a concomitant drain. Players will hate having this drain, but if you do not enforce ongoing expenditures, you will have Monty Haul syndrome, infinite accumulation of wealth, overall rise in the "standard of living" an capabilities of the average player, and thus unbalance in the game design and poor game longevity.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> An online economy might be hard, but you can't fault UO for trying.  Of all the three, only UO has come close.  From rare items like paintings, to housing, to replacing lost or decayed items, "too much money" is a problem a player won't face in UO for a good long time.  In UO there is a reason for blacksmiths to continue making items, there is a reason for an alchemist to grind away, there's even a role for the tailor and the fisherman.  There are sites on the internet and in front of banks that see as much acticity as any middle east bazzar.  Perfect?  Of course not.  The final drain needs to be established.  Player titles?  In city housing?  Items rare and desirable sold only by NPCs?  The ideas are there.  <br><br><b>EQ:</b> For those who doubt Raph on this subject, boot up EQ.  Your items never decay, your body is allways recovered, and what do you do after you've camped every spawn point?  Well, give it to some newbie to twink 'em up.  What the hell, it's only stuff, right?  The minimal trade skills EQ has are seldom used.  Why?  Well, a blacksmith has no need for money and where will he sell his things once his customers all have magic swords of whoop ass?<br><br><b>AC:</b> They can't even plead ignorance on this one.  They had years to figure it out.  Still, like EQ, they overlooked this one important facet of what makes a virtual world as opposed to a first person whooter with swords.  In any world, no matter how simple, there is an economy.  In a world where there's no place to put your things, nothing to spend money on, and an allegience system that encourages twinking, you are left with a world devoid of one of the most important aspects of human society.  For a group that got so many things right, they got this one wrong.....horribly, horribly wrong.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">Ownership is key.  You have to give players a sense of ownership in the game. This is what will make them stay--it is a "barrier to departure." Social bonds are not enough, because good social bonds extend outside the game. Instead, it is context. If they can build their own buildings, build a character, own possessions, hold down a job, feel a sense of responsibility to something that cannot be removed from the game--then you have ownership.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> So god damn important.  Let's say a game was released tomorrow that was every bit as good as UO.  Would I leave UO?  Eventually, but it's going to be a strugle.  It's not just the houses, but the little things.  It's the potted plant, it's the paintings on my wall, it's the ability to make a sword with my name on it.  I worked for those things.  I earned them.  They're mine.  They don't belong to my guild, they don't belong to the game, they are mine.  Rationally I know that it's nothing more than a series of 0s and 1s floating out there in cyberspace....but in my heart that horse belongs to me.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> Your clothes are given to you, you have no home.  The things you posses are things you've taken off the dead bodies of critters.  Sounds like a third world nation to me, and seeing people sit out in the rain in the middle of the desert renforces that.  Somedays I think I see Sally Struthers in the distance ready to plead for relief...and then I realize it's just an orc spawn.<br><br><b>AC:</b> Even if housing goes in, it's going to be guild housing.  You will live with your collective, the only things you own are the things that your collective has given you to twink you up.  As in EQ, the little things are mising.  Owning a horse.  Owning a new suit of clothes.  Having a potted plant to call your own.  If EQ is a third world nation, AC is going to be like an apartment building in Moscow.  Then again, perhaps not...still, they haven't laid the groundwork down yet and you have to wonder if it's too late.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">If your game is narrow, it will fail.  Your game design must be expansive. Even the coolest game mechanic becomes tiresome after a time. You have to supply alternate ways of playing, or alternate ways of experiencing the world. Otherwise, the players will go to another world where they can have new experiences. This means new additions, or better yet, completely different subgames embedded in the actual game.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> I wonder sometimes why this damn game is still on my hardrive.  Ownership was one factor, variety is the other.  When I've gotten sick of the game, within a week or two there will be something else to grab my attention.  I'm not talking about add ons like the second age either.  It's the richness of possible activities.  I've gone from being a warrior to running a shop.  For over a month or two I was obsessed with drawing in customers, selling them goods, helping them when they needed help.  I've been part of movements to form anti-pk guilds.  I've taken part in stories, I've gone on little holy quests at the shrines, I've lived as nothing more than a tradesperson.  There has allways been something.  Perhaps there will be a game that will offer as wide a variety of activities as UO...but I haven't sen it yet.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> There are level 50 characters in Norrath right now wondering why the joy has gone out of the game for them.  You've just killed the meanest monster on the planet...what are you going to do now?  Well, stare at half naked elf chicks I guess.<br><br><b>AC:</b> Active PvP combat on Darktide might help.  We'll see.  I do know that there are less things to do in AC than in UO as far as variety goes.  Will that hurt AC?  You betcha.  Fataly? Well...as with many of these examples, we'll just have to see.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">The quality of roleplaying is inversely proportional to the number of people playing.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> Does Raph sound overly cynical when he says that?  Well, UO is living breathing proof that he's right.  You know, unless you happen to consider "Beavis and Butthead go to Sossaria" to be roleplaying.  The level of roleplaying runs the gambit in UO, from nonexistant to "look, I'm an elf...and somebody killed my parents".  Is this a bad thing?  Not entirely...as I'll get to in a sec.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> Oddly enough there does seem to be roleplaying going on here.  Of course everyone who does roleplay plays a character than runs around, kills rats, sits down, and then kills more rats, but at least it's a defined role.  Besides, at least in EQ one can look like an Elf.  People who roleplay elves in UO and EQ remind me of trekkies.  I mention that only because there aren't enough people who try to kill me on Sonoma.<br><br><b>AC:</b> Like UO we see a wide spectrum represented.  The allegience system, when not used as a pyramid scheme, helps matters some.  Still, there is less roleplaying currently.  Will people start to once they figure out what the hell The Empyrean is?  We'll have to wait and see.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">A roleplay-mandated world is essentially going to have to be a fascist state. Whether or not this accords with your goals in making such a world is a decision you yourself will have to make.</font><br><br>Told you I would get to why lack of roleplaying might not be too bad a thing.  One mans roleplayer is another mans kewlio.  What's the difference between playing "Drow elf seeking vengence for the murder of his parents" and "Fat Tony, mafia don comes to Sossaria"?  In UO both would be out of place...well, perhaps Fat Tony wouldn't.  There is, afterall, supposed to be spillover between our Earth and Sossaria, but don't let the roleplayers that...they might not be able to fight, but they have numbers.  They seem to travel in packs.  The question boils down to "who makes the judgement call?".  The name tyranny in EQ is just one example.  Another is the newbie in EQ who has the sheer unmitigated gall to ask a question about game mechanics without putting "ooc" in front of it.  Bastard.  Thank god there are plenty of folks in EQ to chastise the jerk.  Asking a question.  the nerve!<br><br>You get the point though.  Look, I can sympathize with the roleplayers.  That's what they do in the game, and it's only natural they would want that fiction maintained...it just ain't going to happen, kids.<br><br>Whew.  That was a bunch of stuff.  We're not done yet.  Before we end our little romp through the mind of Raph Koster, there's one more I want to cover.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">The longer your game runs, the less often you get kudos for your efforts.</font><br><br>Quite so.  I've gotten e-mail from some of you thanking me for reminding them of Raph did for our strange little hobby.  A very nice change from the "Raph is the devil" posts we still see from time to time.  I would, however, recomend you mail <a href="mailto:rkoster@origin.ea.com">raph koster</a> those kind words instead of me...I mean the guy must be getting lonley working in mystery all the time.  Send him your words and some nice goat porn why dontcha?<br><br>Raph had a great deal to say.  That's why next we'll take a look at what the next generation of games needs to know...and why they won't listen.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000028.html">Got something to say?

While the East Coast was buying up bread, milk, and toilet paper like the world was coming to an end, EBay Online (sometimes known as Ultima Online) entered into Phase III of the housing revisions. Thank Almighty God <i>that</i> particular project is done. Never mind the fact that people are still placing houses on top of trees, in dungeons, on guard towers, and in the case of Chesapeake, plopping them down <b>two screens away from the Britain Bank</b> (approved by Inspector 16A).<br><br>As is the case with any Ultima Online patch, we wait with baited breath to find out what it broke.<br>This time, we lost just about anything that used to spawn in a locked crate, spawned barrel or dungeon chest.

You know, a slight change in the shade of death robes, and suddenly wandering healers can be tamed and ridden like horses - that sort of thing. Give them a few weeks, this will all get sorted out. I mean, it just wouldn't be UO without dried flowers and bowls of fruit, would it?<br><br>Oh - and if you're looking for a "breast update", listen to that .wav file again and listen carefully to what "Witchiepoo" shakes when she gets mad and flies away.

Awww gee.  I didn't know you folks cared.  I'm touched.  Really.  I can feel the love.  <br><br>Before I get started on what else is bad and wrong about OSI's relationship with its player-base (or the lack thereof), let me clear up a semi-popular misconception:  I was not dissing the Counselors and GMs in my last update.  When I dis you, you'll know it -- trust me on this one.  This series -- the entire thing -- the whole enchilada -- is about OSI's policies as concern their player-base.  So when I write about things I think Counselors and GMs can do or not I'm speaking of policies concerning them at a level that would possibly be <a href="mailto:durga@uo.com">Durga</a> or maybe Tyrant - NOT policies that I think GMs or Counselors can institute.  Ok enough of that -- if you're still pissed I don't care.<br><br>So what else is wrong with OSI's relationship with its player-base?  Oh gee, I dunno.  Maybe having one PR guy for 200K+ players? I speak of none other than our beloved <a href="mailto:calandryll@uo.com">Calandryll</a>, who valiantly peruses the more moderated of boards (that would be  <A href="http://cob.xrgaming.net">COB</a> and  <A href="http://uo.stratics.com">Stratics</a> for those of you not in the know) in search of posts that he can reply "I'll have to speak with the development team and get back to you on that" to.  Poor guy.  I can't believe there's only one of him for the entire UO player-base.  Maybe OSI pays him a bundle because of the masochistic nature of his job and the sadistic tendencies of the player-base who have no one else to take their frustrations out on and can't afford someone to help him with the workload.  Then again that almost seems like a match made in heaven... or hell.. I'm not sure which.  The next time Cal doesn't answer your email take a moment to remember that there is only 1 of him and 200K+ of us before you blast him into perdition for not getting back to you.  <br><br>But this would be a poor update indeed if all I had to write about was OSI's failure to hire more than one PR guy for 200K+ customers (might still be a poor update -- oh well, bite me).  I think the singular thing that most shocked me about OSI when I first started and continues to this day is that their relationship with their player-base is entirely customer driven.  Think not?  How many message boards does OSI host?  How many luncheons were OSI's idea?  Compare the number of player-run events on any shard to the number of those hosted by OSI.  Oh yeah sure its nice to see Callandryl, <a href="mailto:sunsword@uo.com">Sunsword</a>, <a href="mailto:runesabre@uo.com">Runesabre</a>, Tyrant, Lady MOI, Durga and the rest of the crew post on Lum's Gimped message board, COB, Stratics, <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com">the BV boards</a>, etc.  But what came first -- the chicken or the egg?  In this case it was us chickens.  Hell <a href="http://update.uo.com/comments.html">Comments from the Team</a> didn't even hit the OSI website until a few months ago.  And to my knowledge they've never hosted any message boards for their player-base.  Shame on them.  That Stratics is completely player-run and player-compiled blows my mind.  Surely the statistics found on Stratics were available from OSI?  So how hard would it have been to have it on OSI's website where most folks, having just purchased the game and perhaps not having heard of Stratics just yet, would go?  <br><br>Speaking of OSI's website, Leilo has done a damn good job on it.  Just in time too.  I took a trip over <A href="http://www.uo.com">there</a> so I could finish this series of rants with a couple of really long paragraphs about how much it sucked.  Alas, I am too late.  They fixed it.  Damn them for taking some topnotch material away from me.  For the first 2.5 years of UO's existence their website went far beyond normal suckage.  It was hard to read, slow to load (well its still slow to load), hard to navigate, contained no useful information, had some conflicting information, had information about one topic stored in many different places.. I could go on for days.  Since it might be days until I update again maybe I should go on for days so that you guys can get good and sick of me and you won't care if Lum butchered his updaters and hid our mutilated bodies under the sink.  But I digress.<br><br>What more can I say? I think OSI has treated its player-base as an afterthought since the game began.  They've come a long way in the last 2.5 years -- I'll give them that.  But they have so much further to go.  We SHOULD see the developers, Durga, Tyrant, Calandryll, Lady MOI and ESPECIALLY Lord British and Starr Long (aka Lord Blackthorn) in the game occassionally.  If they get mobbed its only for a short while -- they can put up with it.  Would once a month be too much to ask?  Obviously it would. <br><br>OSI should be reaching out to their player-base -- not the other way around.  They SHOULD be hosting message boards and moderating them as well.  Sure its a tough job but it comes with the territory.  It should not be up to the players to find ways of communicating with game staff.  OSI should host luncheons and not leave it to the players to beg for a few staff members to join them here or there.  In other words -- the relationship should NOT be completely customer-driven.<br><br>I expect that an online gaming company would reach out to its player-base.  I expect that the game staff would take the initiative.  I expect to see game staff in the game, walking around, seeing what people are doing and meeting and greeting the players.  I expect Counselors and GMs to be more than troubleshooters.  I expect to receive more than a form letter when I write OSI.  And so should you.  So should all of you.  That OSI has not done this in the past is not a good reason not to expect it and not to demand it and not <b>to continue to expect and demand it</b>.  Any online gaming company should be expected to provide this level of customer service and to be that involved in the game staff/company/player-base relationship.  Maybe its that OSI is used to providing merely a product -- a game in a box that you played until you 'won' and then you put it on the shelf or repeated the process until you were bored.  Well this is not merely a product but both a product and a service.  Maybe OSI  just doesn't care.  Personally I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they do care and just haven't reached the point where they can begin to meet my expectations.  But make no mistake about it -- without us, the player-base, UO is nothing.  Without us the game is an empty shell.  Without us there is no economy.  Without us there is no PVP vs PK vs PVM vs RP discussion.  Without us there are no RP events.  Without us there is no game, no OSI, no paychecks for their employees.  We, the player-base, should be game staff's best fucking friends.  And if we are not then OSI needs to ask themselves why and take whatever steps are necessary to rectify that situation. Customer service and the relationship between game staff and the player-base should be OSI's number one priority.  <br><br>By the way, I don't think OSI is alone in this.  EQ seems much worse -- I'm really glad I don't play that game.  And AC well... all I can say is that <a href="mailto:letoile@turbinegames.com">Chris L'Etoile</a> better hope I don't  buy it and put him and AC's relationship with THEIR player-base under the same microscope I just put OSI's under.  On the other hand maybe he would enjoy having two people from this site to <A href="http://staff.turbinegames.com/letoile/">bitch about</a>.<br><br><A href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000030.html">Wanna bitch about my shitty update?

Be carefull what you wish for kids.  Recently a rumor has been circulating that the lummies were fired by Lum, hece the lack of updates from us.  Well, prepare to pay for that with a long ass multipart rant that you probally won't care about but realy should.  (in truth, nobody at Lumcorp had time this weekend.  Myschef was busy at a weight clinic for retarded asian lesbians, Arcadian was busy <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~tzimisce69/satanspork.html">questioning his sexuality after dinner at KFC</a>, I was busy doing terrible things to sheep and writing a new <a href="http://greatbob.uoboard.net/">comic</a> and liteguards...well she was doing something vitally important to the future of the human race that if I told you about I would have to kill you.  It's a busy life here at lumcorp.)<br><br>Now that the big three of MMORPGFWIWSD (Massivly Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games Filled With Idiots Who Should Die) have been established, let's take a look at <a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/laws.html">Laws of Mud design</a> as compiled by Raph Koster and look at what the big three did right...and where they just screwed the pooch.<br><br><b>The Laws of Mud Design</b><br><br><font color="#00CC00">The secrets to a really long-lived, goal-oriented, online game of wide appeal:<br><br>have multiple paths of advancement (individual features are nice, but making them ladders is better).<br><br>make it easy to switch between paths of advancementt (ideally, without having to start over) </font><br><br><b>UO:</b> Well, it should come as no surprise that UO nailed this one on the head.  I started playing UO with the dream of being a great fighter, weilding the sword of righteous fury against the scum who terrorized the land...then I realized that a sword did no real damage in the days before the dex monkeys, and the idiots will allways win.  I wound up wandering between being an archer, an armsman than finally a mage.  If I had to restart my character for every path, would I feel as attached to him?  Probally not.  I look at my character now, and see remnants of the skills he once had.  He's unique.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> Levels and Classes.  If you're a mage, here are the skills you can and cannot have.  Want to be a mage who wields a weapon different from other mages?  Sorry.  Want to become something different than what you are?  Just start over.  Neither of those games ever broke clear of the paradigm established by D+D back in the eighties.  Levels may be helpfull to mark advancment, but classes force every character down a very narrow path.  In the real world I work with computers...does that mean I can't also write a comic strip or weild a sword?  Of course not.  In EQ  it does.<br><br><b>AC:</b> [correction added after rant was put up]  I have been informed that AC is closer to a skill system than a class system.  This is quite so, and I apologize for mispeaking.  That being said, the transition between advancment paths is moe dificult than UO.  <br><br><font color="#00CC00">No matter what you do, someone is going to automate the process of playing your world. Corollary: Looking at what parts of your game players tend to automate is a good way to determine which parts of the game are tedious and/or not fun.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> It's hard to practice what you preach, even if you're Raph Koster.  UO is an environment where you almost have to macro.  Fun is not clicking on an object hundreds of thousands of times.  Instead of looking at the reasons why people macro, the dev teams (both old and new) decided to try and stop the practice instead.<br><br><b>EQ and AC:</b> They got this one right, that's for sure.  In AC you can macro.  People don't because the process of gaining skills is actually fun.  You do something.  It might be killing rats or drudges over and over again, but at least it's an activity.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">It is always more rewarding to kill other players than to kill whatever the game sets up as a target.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> It led to bad reviews.  It led to violent debates.  It led to a society of gangbanger wanna-bes.  Before it fades off into the sunset, let's look at what Player Killing has brought to the table.  It's an issue which devides the community, but would UO still be here without it?  Most Likley.  Would it still have as many players today without it?  Actually, I don't think so. No matter how agressive an AI you establish, it'll never match the challange of another human.  No matter how good you are, every combat you engage in will be dangerous.  What is a game without a challange?  More importantly it's a needed ingredient for building a society.  Societies are often formed for mutual protection.  If protection comes from code, why bother building one?  It's not just a PK/Victim debate.  There's another group like me who has fun defending an area from scum.<br><br><b>EQ:</b> Charlie don't surf and apparently Elves don't fight.  Even when PvP is allowed it's pathetic.  After all the 50th level mobs are eliminated, what will remain except a chat room filled with half naked elf chicks?  Damned if I know. The elves are easy on the eyes though.<br><br><b>AC:</b> Will Rodgers once said "the middle of the road is the surest place to get run over".  Well, AC walks that path and it works for them.  Sure, they have a segmented community, but they actually put some thought into PvP combat.  Is it perfect?  No.  Is it better than EQ?  You betcha.  Is it better than UO?  Well, that's the tough one.  You will never have the heated level of debate over PvP that you have in UO.  If someone in AC doesn't like it, they can go to another server.  Will the society be as dynamic?  We'll just have to see.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">Never trust the client.  The client is in the hands of the enemy.</font><br><br><b>UO:</b> Before the days of beta, people sat back smugly and said "all information is stored server side.  There shall never be a hack".  You in the back row, stop laughing.  At the time it made sense.  Raph was right.  ANYTHING on the client will eventually be hacked.  Want proof?<br><br><b>EQ:</b> Here's your proof.  I want to see a show of hands here on who believes that there isn't a massive cheat program out there?  You with the hands raised, you're wrong.  ShowEQ was the tip of the iceberg.  EQ sat back fat and lazy with it's belief that security was good enough never to allow a cheat.  They'll pay for that.  Diablo sure did.<br><br><b>AC:</b> I don't know, I've never taken the damn thing apart.  I will say this to Turbine....if there is information stored client side, change it fast.  You'll thank me for that advice later.<br><br>But where do the differences really lie between the big three?  Next up, we'll look at the all important laws of ownership, storylines and a bunch of other goodies...and we'll talk about what the next generation needs to learn.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000028.html">Got something to say?

As this one <a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=10201.topic&start=1&stop=20">reports</a>:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">After petitioning & spending an hour ingame on my brother's account I was contacted by GM Delanus of Bristlebain and was told that I was banned by another person at Verant "Because I was caught using a hack program". I was directed to email the other guy who will be off for the next 2 days and see if I can get reinstated that way. When asked what reimbursements I could expect to receive for being unable to play during time I was paying for (Especially, since I can see this stretching into WEEKS at this rate) Delanus was unable to give me an answer. Needless to say, I have never used a hack program in Everquest. For gods' sake, if anyone took the time to examine my substandard equipment they would know that I wasn't cheating. (Or that if I was I had the program in reverse or something) ; ) </font><br><br>And <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000981.html">again</a>, with somewhat more detail:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I play a Dark-Elf Wizard character on the Bristlebane server and just recently made level 20. After meeting a friend at the arena in West Freeport and binding there, I had decided to head to Lake Rathe to kill some Aviaks. Being a wizard we have the luxary to teleporting, and at level 20, North Gate is the quickest way there. After memorizing the spell i proceded to use it, but where it took me was not where i had intended. After the zone had loaded, it read you have entered Dagnors Cauldrun (or something simular to that) and did one of those "Player is under world, returning to safe point". I then attempted to turn around to see exactly where i was and it froze my computer. (the computer freezing probably wasnt directly linked to the bug in the game, but the computer still froze) when i rebooted and relogged in, I was back at my bind point in freeport. I then petitioned to have the problem resolved, because after all, I wasnt supposed to be dumped in Dagnors Cauldrun in the first place. After talking to an aprentice guide, it had been escalated to a guide, and was consitered an underworld death. The guide that helped me was very friendly and helpfull. He brought me to my corpse and resurected me for the lost experience i had suffered (and losing my lvl 20). He instructed me to fill out a bug report and say what had happened, and that he would do the same. After filling out the report explaining what had happened, i tested the spell again a few times to see if it was only a one time bug, and it wasnt. It consistantly took me to the same place, but this time i did not die (luckily). After a few more minutes, and being tired of the whole deal, I logged off for a little while to get some food. When I tried to reconnect about an hour after, i was suprised to see that i had been Banned for "Inapropriate Behavior". I then called Tech support, but they were closed for the holiday (monday). The next day i waited until 11:30est to call tech support again, and they told me that they could not get any info on it, and to call back later, around 2:00. I waited a few hours, called back again, and was told i was banned for "Hacking" and had to email the GM in order for anything to be resolved. </font><br><br>And <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003646.html">again</a>:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Right after the patch I tried to teleport from Dagnors Cauldron to Lavastorm Mountains, I was teleported under the world then to a safe spot within Dagnors Cauldron. I tried repeatedly to teleport to Lavastorm, but experienced the same thing. Finally i teleported to West commons and ran into Lavastorm. No furthur problems were experienced that gaming session, I even teleported from Solusek B to Lavastorm mountains later that day.<br><br>Upon logging on to Everquest the following day, I received a "You have been banned for Hacking" notice</font><br><br>Abashi's response, when finally pinned down:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Sorry guys, we don't reply to these because it's between the owner of the account and our customer service department. Now I suppose if the owners of those accounts want their personally issues drug out in public, we can do that if they like. Of the two bannings I saw mentioned in the other thread, I looked at the evidence on one of them, and it&#8217;s very persuasive. <br><br>If anyone else in that thread wants to send me their station name (login name), I'll be happy to look into it directly. Bannings for "Hacking" are so clear-cut that they leave no room for misinterpretation. We don&#8217;t give warnings for it, we don&#8217;t even care if you are successful. If you even unsuccessfully attempt to hack the game then we don&#8217;t want you as a customer. <br><br>We are absolutely committed to keeping EverQuest cheat-free.</font><br><br>Well, either there's a bug in Everquest that somehow involves druids and wizards, or some new autobugtracker has gone wiggy.<br><br>Of course, we've never seen this before, have we, boys and girls?<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000027.html">I'd never use ShowEQ, no, no, not me!</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem948748133,35302,"></a>

As opposed to the last entry, this is an actual UO2 news entry! Baby Jesus is <b>just all-atwitter</b>, because a New Letter from the Producer and NEW FAQ questions were added to the <a href="http://www.uo2.com/">UO2 web site!</a> Oh frabjous joy! The sun is shining and rainbows pierce the gloom of the day!<br><br>OK, I'll stop. To summarize -- UO2 will have shards, but they won't be called shards. Instead they'll be called servers. UO2 will have a magic system. UO2 will continue the Barbie Doll Paradigm of dressing yourself in a vain and futile attempt to distinguish yourself from a hundred thousand other gimps. Next month the UO2 team hopes to be able to slip over the fences and past the Team MOI Death Squad Stormtrooper Guards and actually comment on a message board or two. (After the ensuing flaming they will then retreat back to the safety of the Happy Non Disclosure Agreement Campgrounds. But that's just <i>my prediction.</i>) Starr Long also had this utterly unmockable quote:<br><br><font color="#ff88ff">The big question we asked ourselves was 'does fantasy have to be medieval?' Our answer was no. </font><br><br>Technically, of course, using this logic, any fiction could be classified as "fantasy". My fantasy involves Uma Thurman and zero gravity, but do you see me trying to make an ORPG out of it? Unfortunately, the part of my fantasy world that would in fact relate to UO2 was brutally quashed:<br><br><font color="#ff88ff">Don't expect to see machine guns or laser rifles though.</font><br><br>Piffle. I bet they put laser rifles in Shadowbane. Nyah. Anyway, keep your good eye on the UO2 web site, because, as IT says, "This page will be updated frequently, so check back often!". And keep your bad eye right here, because I'm liable to poke at it with a stick.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000026.html">Oh come on, you UO2 dev guys, you can post here.

Chris "FUCK YOU, Mushashi!" L'Etoile has a <a href="http://staff.turbinegames.com/letoile/">plan</a>. You know all that already, mainly because since Azile just went kneedeep into the Darktide political hoopla, it's the only thing in the Asheron's Call universe worth reading that uses the word "fuck" (damn, there's that word again) until Musashi updates <a href="http://mu.ranter.net/">his damn website</a>. Earlier last week he mentioned my name, which ordinarily would have been enough to set me off into a frenzy of self-referential spouting, except I was kind of busy trying to play Asheron's Call again.<br><br>Anyway, to summarize for you puds who can't read, he took issue with my gleefully shouting "KILL ALL THE DUPING BASTARDS!" at the latest UOE-related banning in UO, wondered how that jived with the (non-existent) bitching I did about the KoC duper banning in UO (hint - I approved of that one too) and then mused about how that squared with my bitching about his saying that threatening to ban your userbase is bad, mmmmkay? (Actually he makes a valid point about moral equivalence which would have, um, made more sense if he had made it in his original posting. But <b>that's OK. Really.</b>) The conclusion he then reached was that because I tried AC for a week and didn't like it, I was automatically an OSI fanboy.<br><br>Or, instead of distorting his words, let's just repeat them;<br><br><font color="#77FF77">This made everything crystal clear to me. Lum's a cynical guy, with a dim view of humanity in general, and MMORPG developers in particular. Therefore, anything I could possibly say in a given situation will be automatically wrong to him.<br><br>However, since Lum enjoys UO, he's willing to give the benefit of the doubt to its developers. He may rant about how they handle issue X until he's blue in the face, but at the end of the day, they're still his game company. It's like when I see rabid Red Sox fans cursing the parentage of the manager and every member of the team as they sit in the stands at Fenway in a torrential downpour, waving their little foam "number one" hand.<br><br>This doesn't bother me anymore. He's not riding my ass because he thinks I, specifically, am wrong (although he might); he's riding it because that's what Lum does, and because he doesn't like AC.</font><br><br>OK. First off, if I ever am seen with one of those candy ass foam rubber "numbah one" things, you can goddamn well SHOOT ME ON SIGHT. It's for the best. ANYway.<br><br>Origin is <b>NOT</b> my game company. Really. It's <a href="http://www.my1stop.com">some idiot</a> that owns ERTS stock, not me. I like some of the folks that work there now, mainly because they're the fourth generation or so who went through the revolving doors and are actually former gamers themselves with clues. That being said, if you or anyone else think I'm giving them a free pass, wait until UO2 hits. I've got about 20 loads of buckshot just waiting to go off into someone based on what little I've already heard about <b>that</b> little atrocity.<br><br>But I think what really has Chris all pissy is that, well, I've been pretty vocal about not doing so well with Asheron's Call. That's understandable. It's like, his job and stuff. As he wrote to Mu, while indulging in that sport of ORPG developers everywhere called "We're Not OSI":<br><br><font color="#ff77FF">Bottom line, the Staff does not exist because she did "something cool on a site, or host(ed) an event, or suck(ed) miles of cock, or deliver(ed) chinese take-out to our offices." You of all people should know us better than to think that, Mu. I'm very disappointed to learn that one of the most clueful people in the community, and one of perhaps a dozen who's met us personally, can still think that we'd play favorites like OSI does. WE'RE NOT OSI, all right? We regard their behavior as absolute anathema, as a case in point of what not to do. Damn, don't I slam them enough in my .plan to make that clear?  <br><br>Everyone had the same shot at getting the Staff - it certainly wasn't Sarneho's decision. If Caeryn's abusing it (I don't think she is as a matter of course, otherwise this would have come up before now), we'll take a hard, long look at what, if anything, can be done to reign it in. You know why? Because, unlike OSI, whenever we find that a mistake has been made, we admit it and we fucking fix it. The WoBF was in the game beginning in Preview2, but when it was discovered and exploited nine months later, we fixed it promptly. <br><br>Jesus Christ, does every AC player still have 'Nam flashbacks to the abuses of UO? Calm down and tell us what the problems are before you jump down are throats with all these accusations and threats. Don't think I missed that part about visiting the office with a baseball bat. I know you're mad, Mu, and you have good reason to be, but that's crossing a line. Go ahead and say we're cocksmoking moron losers who don't know how to design or run a game. Don't threaten us with physical harm. </font><br><br>So, without threatening ANY PHYSICAL HARM AT ALL to anyone at Turbine, let's come clean here. I have a secret I need to share with you all. When it comes to these games, I suck.<br><br>No, really. It's true. In Everquest, I'm a permanewb who can't seem to get the hang of getting past 11th level, and the only reason I keep going with it is because my wife's like a level 93 Hell Wizard and she looks at me forlornly, wordlessly thinking "Come on! It's only level 20! It's not that hard! You can do it!". Unfortunately, Everquest requires you to be nice to idiots, but that's a whole another topic. And in Ultima Online I was pretty much comic relief. UO is great in that you can suck and still pretty much be up to the standard of everyone else in the game, so I could run around in a death robe and make fun of others, and the fact that (remember) I suck at these games doesn't come out and hit you. I like to think that this means that UO has a thriving community, because anything that lets me be the village idiot in the same world as <a href="http://www.my1stop.com/">some idiot</a> is all good in da hood.<br><br>But in the world of Dereth, I just suck. I wander around the newbie villages and some shreth or something will kill me and steal my one piece of armor and I'm sitting at a lifestone going "What the fuck?". At least on Darktide I could use the excuse that it was a PK.<br><br>What's funny, of course, is that this makes me the ORPG's perfect target market. I'm not the guy that sits in your game for 19 hours a day camping spawn points or waiting for houses to decay, I'm the guy who tries to play a couple hours a week or so because I have, like, stuff to do. <br><br>Asheron's Call does a lot of things wrong and a lot of things right. Someday I'll revisit that topic when I'm feeling more pundity. And I have no doubt that, like UO, which was a burning hellpit of bugs and damnation on it's release, it will improve into more right then wrong. By that time I may be 5th level.<br><br>However, OSI has learned one lesson that Chris and everyone else may need to learn: it's not about cool shit, it's not about dynamic landscape alteration, it's about having a community that's so whack you can run around with a newbie named <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Underworld/1888/main.html">Bob</a> and still have a good time.<br><br>At any rate, it's late and I need to jet, but I leave you with these words: it's OK to suck, if you can make light of it on your web page later.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000025.html">It's OK, Lum, we suck, too.</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem948695398,38083,"></a>

Howzabout a new ORPG you never heard of. <a href="http://www.iencentral.com/">iEntertainment Network</a>, which used to be Imagic Games, which was formed by the guy who founded Microprose after they kicked him out, clear now?

The ShowEQ saga continues. About a half hour after the latest EQ patch, a patch to ShowEQ was posted -- however, it merely filters out the now encrypted spawn data (which does pretty much cripple the "cheatness" of the utility) <br><br>Stratics also had something to say finally about their packet sniffer. Note that I did contact Stratics about the story when I ran it (thinking possibly they were unaware of what they were hosting), and in fact held it for a day waiting for a response which never came. Instead, Ryan "Den" Findley, the owner of Stratics, posted this to <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/">http://eq.stratics.com/</a> --<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Recently there has been some controversy in certain quarters concerning our EverQuest Items Database (and, to a certain extent, our Spells Database), which is available from this site as a resource for all players. The controversy involves a completely unrelated program called ShowEQ, the use of which has been officially banned by Verant Interactive. The utility that our Database utilizes is very different than the illegal ShowEQ program, however, as explained below by the EQ Items Database author, Thorvald Natvig:<br><br><i>Recently someone suggested the EQ Items program, which is used to auto-submit items to the Items database, might be illegal and a breach of the EQ License Agreement. EQ Items does not alter or interfere with game play in any way whatsoever.<br><br>It does not offer any player an advantage over another player. And seeing that both the database and a hosted front-end is provided to anyone that asks, it does not offer Stratics any commercial advantage. All it does is offer the players and webmasters in the EverQuest community a complete and comprehensive items database that anyone can access.</i><br><br>We are in the process of communicating with Verant about this matter in order to have things cleared up, and have great faith the issue will be resolved for the better of all EQ Players.<br><br>We recognize the sensitive nature of such a utility and have been in contact with Verant Interactive concerning this issue. Throughout this correspondence, no representative of Verant has expressed any desire for Stratics to remove or alter the EQ Items in any way. <b>Regardless, we've informed Verant that we will do everything in our power to comply with their wishes, up to and including the modification and/or complete removal of any reference to the EQ Items utility.</b><br><br>Stratics has and always will attempt to better the communities surrounding the games that we cover within our network and will comply with any game developer's wishes concerning the use of any utility or resource offered from our URL. As any longtime reader of Stratics knows, we would never knowingly or willingly contribute to the destruction of play balance or fairness within any of our featured titles.<br><br>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me personally at den@stratics.com. Thank you for visiting Stratics.</font><br><br>Sure, Ryan, if you ever answer your email I might take you up on that offer. <br><br>Meanwhile, development on ShowEQ rages on. The "mysterious" "ShowEQ" (well, actually I doubt anyone outside Verant really cared <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/ftheshoweqmessageboardshoweqgeneralforum.showMessage?topicID=299.topic">revealed himself</a> to be Megaton, who is working with Ashran on <a href="http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/">HackersQuest</a>. Ashran formerly made a name for himself as the author of UOPlugin. Small world out there. In Ashran's words:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The whole release of ShowEQ was meant as test for Verant and for the EQ-users as an experiment. We wanted to see how the general public and Verant would react after such thing. The man to blame errr, I mean to congratulate for such a great program as ShowEQ is Megaton.<br><br>After this patch we'll see what Verant did to stop it. (Given that I can use some friends account to log in,  because I have canceled mine a week ago.)<br><br>I have decided to not put up the ShowEQ files yet, since it is not going to work after the patch.<br><br>Maybe we will release the windows version of ShowEQ too, but propably not as open source.<br><br>Megaton and me are working on an update for ShowEQ, to work with the recent client patch. Verant changed the packet headers and also encrypted the NPS spawn packet.<br><br>We'll keep you updated!</font><br><br>And, just in case the wonderful world of EQ wasn't dizzy enough, <a href="http://eq.drtwister.com/">Dr. TwisTer</a> found our old friend Roebin of the Rathe again -- the guy who accused the Triad, Rathe's uberguild consortium, of item-farming for eBay sales. This time, according to Roebin, they've <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/014669.html">upgraded to 1-800 numbers</a>. <br><br><font color="#77FF77">Basically, this is the situation on the Rathe server as my inquiry of the facts has led me to conclude. There is a "commercialized" operation on the Rathe server whose sole design is to sell items to other players via credit card. These items are generally high-end items and getting them is difficult, and on the Rathe Server, next to impossible because of certain guilds that have monopolized it.

The Austin American-Statesman <a href="http://www.austin360.com/statesman/editions/friday/technopolis_1.html">posted a story</a> about online gaming. They think it's keen!<br><br><font color="#77FF77">"We've learned a lot about online entertainment over the past two years since we launched Ultima Online," said Jeff Anderson, executive producer for UO2. "But most important, we've learned that we are not just making games anymore. We're building virtual worlds that will offer new ways for people to interact and socialize." <br><br>...<br><br>For Terry King, 30, who has played Ultima Online since the beginning two years ago, this phenomenon translates into more than pocket change. The five-year Dell employee spends 35 hours a week in the fantasy world, generally playing Red Alkeistarte, an evil lord who can summon giant demons to his defense. Terry creates virtual characters and buildings he can sell in the real world. <br><br>For instance, he recently sold his virtual castle from the Ultima realm at an online auction site for some $3,000 cash money and sold a tower for $1,500 and a couple of houses for about $500 each. These bits of virtual real estate give a character great prestige and take months or years of steady playing to build. Terry/Red said he also makes an extra $200 a week selling characters he has created. <br><br>All that said, Terry/Red maintains that he plays mostly for the people he meets. "I have 350 people on ICQ (an instant online messaging service), and most of them play with me every single week, if not day," he said. "What I like most is the people I play with, the sense of community and identity." <br><br>King's wife, Christy, is also an avid gamer, and with four computers in their house the couple often plays in the same world at the same time, but hardly ever see each other in the virtual world. That's because their guilds, the online gaming groups to which they belong, are sworn enemies. <br><br>Christy plays a war mage, Kitty, in the world of Ultima, and finds the online experience very alluring. "I tried Final Fantasy VII (a single-player game), but I didn't like it because it was just me sitting at a computer," she said. "What keeps you there is the interaction." <br><br>Many players she meets online want to know if she's a "real" female, Christy said, "And then they immediately want to be your online boyfriend."</font><br><br>Red Alkeistarte's guild site, KDOLS, is <a href="http://www.kdols.com/">here</a>.<br><br>Stop... <a href="http://www.mchammer.com/">Hammer time</a>.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000017.html">You can't touch this</a></b>.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem948467979,21535,"></a>

I'm in a crappy mood, so here's just a brief list of stuff that bugs me. If at least one item on this list offends each and every one of you, I've done my job.<br><br>VERANT<br><br>Verant pisses me off on a regular basis, but they actually achieved new levels of making-Lum-curse-like-a-dyspeptic-sailorness last night. You see, there was a fairly large patch last night. And you see, I work for a living and so logged into EQ around the same time as pretty much everyone else in the Continental United States that also works for a living. And you see, Verant has fucking retarded monkeys for networking staff. I know they are retarded monkeys, because even normal monkeys would know to check the usual patterns of usage to see whether or not the fucking patch server would crap out and decide not to work. And you see, Verant has fucking retarded monkeys that have been given electroshock treatment to purge their memory of all impure thoughts actually writing their code, because for the better part of last night I kept trying to download the fucking Plane of Sky about 600 times (give or take 3) and, because of said retarded monkeys who couldn't plan for network usage worth a shit, the overloaded patch server kept timing out when sending me the file. But could the patch server know how much had been sent to me already and resume from that point? Hell no! That would be too hard! I mean, FTP is only an open standard. It's too HARD to break open those RFCs and actually figure out how to implement stuff, especially when you're a fucking retarded monkey whose brains have been fried by the Bad People and don't know where the hell your next banana is coming from anyway. <br><br>I was mildly irritated. Can you tell?<br><br>WHINY LITTLE SHITS ON MESSAGE BOARDS<br><br>I am so fucking sick of reading message boards. In fact, I'm so sick of it, I'm going to turn that beat around, not because I love to hear percussion (though I DO, mind you) but because this is an Opportunity! And, like all good opportunities, it's an opportunity to get drunk. So I present to you the Whiny Little Gimps Of Everquest Drinking Game.<br><br>Go to a message board for a given class, selected at random. Begin clicking message links at random. Have your drink at the ready.<br><br>Whenever you read "rangers are too powerful" take a drink.<br><br>Whenever you read "necromancers are too powerful" take a drink.<br><br>Whenever you read "druids are too powerful" TWICE, take a drink. You have to space it out with whines about druids or you'll run out of your drink too quickly.<br><br>Whenever you read a message that is a petition to Verant, take two drinks.<br><br>Whenever you read that Verant doesn't care about us because they never read message boards, take a drink.<br><br>Whenever you read a reply from Gordon or Brad in response to that thread, drain the bottle.<br><br>Of course, once you're done with that, you probably still have basic motor functions. This will not do, so go immediately to the CoB Dev Board, where I present to you the Whiny Little Gimps of Ultima Online Drinking Game.<br><br>Whenever you read the word "precasting", take a drink.<br><br>Whenever you read the word "roleplayer", take a drink.<br><br>Whenever you see a post by Calandryll, take a sip. Don't worry, they add up quickly.<br><br>Whenever you read the words "OSI should", take a VERY small sip.<br><br>Whenever you read the word "recall", drain the bottle.<br><br>AOL<br><br>AOL just bugs me for existing. I don't use AOL, but the thought that I exist in the same continent as AOL makes me feel like bugs are crawling just underneath my skin. This can be a pleasurable sensation sometimes, but not when talking about AOL. And now, of course, in case you missed the news, AOL owns the universe (the result of a stock swap with the Vatican and Fidel Castro).<br><br>AOL is everything that is wrong about our civilization. Log onto AOL and everything is bright and cheerful and commercialized (even the dialog boxes have ad banners in AOLville). Nasty thoughtcrime is neatly edited out. Crappy proxy servers and antediluvian client software is pitched as somehow better than the actual Internet. The whole enterprise is pitched as one big fat hairy greaseball of millions of thumbsucking idiots who've been trained to click the "BUY NOW" button on demand.<br><br>AOL makes me like Microsoft.

Origin has just announced the following. And the streets of Australia were... well, as quiet as they usually are.<br><br><font color="#FF77FF">Origin and EA Australia are pleased to announce the imminent launch of our 21st and newest shard, Oceania. Located in Sydney, Australia, Oceania will provide dramatically improved gameplay for many players logging on from Australasia. Oceania is scheduled to go live, barring any unexpected complications, on February 1st, 2000. <br><br>The name Oceania was selected as the result of a poll of players from<br>Australasia and is the term for the approximately 25,000 islands located in a 3.5 million square mile area of the Pacific Ocean known as the South Seas. We feel that the name wonderfully captures the vastness and diversity of the region, as well as the vastness and diversity of the multiverse that is Britannia. <br><br>After the limited period of local exclusivity to South Asia-Pacific players, Oceania will be opened up to UO players worldwide. Please join us in welcoming the newest shard to UO, and help us make Oceania one of the most exciting and vibrant UO communities.</font><br><br>Let the player killing begin!<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000014.html">Comment on the latest from the Ministry of Love in the Forums</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem948391594,37708,"></a>

<p>Plot. Characterization. People who don't act like flaming idiots. Hell, just   a somewhat pleasant way to kill a few hours.</p><p>You know, all the stuff you imagined when you signed up for Ultima Online/Everquest/Asheron's   Call. Unfortunately, all these games have proven is that when you get upwards   of 2000 people on one server, it's a foregone conclusion that 1,999 of them   aren't playing the game you paid for. Be it noto-PKers in UO, kill stealing   powerlevellers in EQ or AI-abusing spawn point farmers in AC, a lot of people   Just Don't Get It - they don't understand why YOU are playing the game. </p><p>Well, the developers hear you. The next batch of ORPGs, spearheaded by <a href="http://www.uo2.com/" target="_blank">UO2</a>,   may well be the last time a few thousand people are thrown on a server and expected   to fend for themselves. We're seeing discussion begin on a number of new ideas   in ORPGs... among them recognition that community building is one of the main   attractions of this medium. You'd think this would be an obvious thing, but   game developers tend to be <a href="http://www.daikatana.com/" target="_blank">slow</a>. </p><p>ORPGs to date have addressed community building from the perspective of a sledgehammer   meeting an anvil. </p><p>UO is the anvil. All the anvil does is sit there and take the blows. UO originally   expected community to arise, phoenix-like, from the ashes of the corpses lining   the streets of Trinsic, with no attempt at in-game programming support. Support   for guildstones was quickly added, however, and the most rewarding moments in   UO often occur in the context of guild interactions, whether between guild members   cooperating to meet an objective or conflict between two or more guilds. </p><p>EQ by contrast is the sledgehammer. Everquest was designed to be played by   groups of 3 to 6 players at a time. You can try to play EQ by yourself, but   the experience is painful and tedious at best. The game really is built around   this one concept - a team of six, with interlocking dependencies and strengths.   A cleric can heal exceptionally well but has little offensive capability. A   warrior can take brutal punishment but is totally helpless if the target decides   to, say, leave. A wizard can kill creatures merely by looking at them sternly,   but woe betide her if that creature survives long enough to hit back. If you   work with the sledgehammer - the intent of the designers - you can find a fairly   decent gaming experience. If you work against the sledgehammer, well, it feels   about as if a sledgehammer hit you. Larger-scale player interactions don't really   work in Everquest. Not only is the 3D engine not well suited to 30 people talking   to one another, but there really is no function for a large-scale guild in EQ   save the coordination of forming those smaller, 6-person groups. You will play   the game the way it is decreed or you will suffer.</p><p>AC is too young to really make honest judgements in its community building.   Call it the air between the sledgehammer and the anvil? Naw, let's just walk   slowly away from that metaphor and not look back. The allegiance/fealty system   is interesting in theory, but so far in practice it mainly consists of a total   stranger walking up to you and offering you phat l3wt if you promise to give   him your XP. It will be interesting, however, to see if a larger guild can really   make the allegiance system work, especially in a roleplayed environment. I expect   this will take place on Darktide (the PK server) first as the artificial constraints   of PvP switches tend to hinter the ability to deal with idiots without outside   intervention. <a href="http://azile.tradespot.net/" target="_blank">Azile</a>   is weaving a fairly interesting tale of shifting allegiances on her site, although   I'm kind of lost as to how she can make ruthless fun of Alice-te Katrina one   day and ally with her the next. Then again, I've been nice to <a href="http://www.happypuppy.com/features/bth/bth-vol8-46.html" target="_blank">Durga</a>   lately, too.</p><p>With the possible exception of AC, community building is really an afterthought   for all of these games. The expectation with UO was that the sheer critical   mass of thousands of people online at once would just spontaneously generate   community. Maybe it got PKed. EQ is a good example of the other side of the   equation. Community building is almost impossible in EQ simply because you rarely   play with the same people in any given gaming session due to the heavily forced   nature of grouping with those of identical needed skills. I'm told that once   lvl 50 (the top tier of advancement) is reached this changes, and uberguilds   form at that point. Maybe in three years or so I can tell you about that first   hand. </p><p>But what if a game was actually built on the thought that the fun of the game   is in interacting with a given group of friends on a somewhat long-term, persistent   basis -- I know, it's crazy, but it <b>just might work.</b></p><p>Let's discuss three of the new games hoping to prove it - Shadowbane, Neverwinter   Nights, and "X". </p><p><b>SHADOWBANE - "THE WEAK SHALL PERISH!" </b></p><p><a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/">Shadowbane</a> is probably the closest   of these to release, and we may well see it around the same time as UO2 (late   2000), with a limited beta due to begin soon. It's made a few interesting assumptions.</p><p>Shadowbane has positioned itself as a Player vs Player game. While a risky   assumption when looking at Everquest and Asheron's Call's successes with a PvP   switch, bear in mind that games such as Quake and Unreal outsell both of those   by a wide margin. Lots of people do want to kill each other (virtually, we hope).   The problem here is that those same PvPers tend to attract a fairly large subset   of ...assholes. You see, unlike Quake or Unreal where equality lays just past   the next respawn, it is possible to be a bully in ORPG PvP, and to spend your   entire online career preying on those far weaker than yourself. In fact, that's   really the most efficient method of advancement, especially in UO. Like Willie   Sutton said, you go where the money is, and human beings do a better job of   collecting it then &quot;a troll&quot; or &quot;a_froglok_shin_lord&quot;. Thanks   to developers buffing up monsters to be a challenge, humans, tend to be quite   a bit easier to kill, as well. Bullies, in case you missed the experience in   grade school, tend to be assholes. Generally, you do not want to spend money   to be around assholes. In fact, a lot of us spent a great deal of money to avoid   assholes. Especially in grade school.</p><p>Shadowbane's developers seem to be going after said assholes with great gusto,   based on their marketing thus far - &quot;I don't play games to bake bread,   I play them to crush!&quot; &quot;The strong will do well, and the weak will   perish!&quot; Think what would happen if you put Conan in charge of <b>your   </b>advertising. </p><p>Luckily, there seems to be a bit more to Shadowbane than testosterone poisoning.   Judging from what information has been released, the game is built around a   <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/warfare.html" target="_blank">meta-guild   system</a>. Players join a guild, which can be run by their friends or by the   game masters themselves, and those guilds themselves band together in nation-states,   which, as nations tend to do, invade each other for the purpose of rape, pillage,   and proving the superiority of their economic system.</p><p>Ultima Online's developers have made noises of implementing a similar meta-guild   system called &quot;factions&quot;, but Shadowbane's system, if it can be successfully   implemented, will provide a unique experience - think of an ORPG less as a monster-harvesting   festival but as a wargame - a contest both of strategy and tactics, with each   part from the Overlord to Spearchucker #12 filled by a human being. </p><p>If it works, it'll be great fun. If it doesn't work, it will make Ultima Online's   darkest days look like a paradise of sharing and caring. Place your bets. </p><p><a href="http://sb.drtwister.com/" target="_blank">Dr. TwisTer's Shadowbane   site</a> has done a stellar job on keeping an eye on Shadowbane's development.   Check the FAQ sections in particular for a large compendium of what the Shadowbane   dev team has had to say on the game's design so far (which has been quite a   bit).</p><p><b>NEVERWINTER NIGHTS - &quot;I ROLL A D20. DO I MAKE MY SAVE?&quot;</b></p><p><a href="http://www.neverwinternights.com/" target="_blank">Neverwinter Nights</a>,   due in 2001, will change the ORPG landscape. Other games will suddenly wonder   where all their players went. It looks that promising. </p><p>NWN (not the first game to bear that title, interestingly enough - <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Computer_Games/Titles/Role_Playing/Neverwinter_Nights/" target="_blank">Neverwinter   Nights on AOL</a> can make a good stab at claiming the title of first mass market   ORPG) is an AD&amp;D simulator. As described, it consists of two parts - the   Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide. </p><p>The Player's Handbook - the game client - is similar in form if not function   to the Bioware engine used to power Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment. While   using 3D rendering instead of the 2D sprites of the earlier titles, it promises   to be as faithful to the AD&amp;D rules set. </p><p>The Dungeon Master's Guide is where things get interesting. Bioware is promising   to include a complete authoring system for NWN. You can design your own &quot;modules&quot;,   and act as game master to a group of adventurers. A 56k modem might host 6,   a cable modem might host 64.</p><p>This model presents all sorts of interesting possibilites, and Bioware looks   set to act on them. Among the promised features - portals between servers, which   opens up the potential for linked worlds hosted by a co-operative of game masters.   A &quot;Character Vault&quot; similar to what is promised for Diablo 2, to prevent   character hacking by keeping character data server-side. </p><p>Wanted to be a seer in UO? This goes further. Imagine not only designing your   world and your storyline, but controlling key monsters within it - when the   players talk to them, they talk to you. Similar to some events we've seen in   UO already, but given the lower player-GM ratio in NWN you stand a far better   chance of affecting the story. In fact, in NWN you <b>are</b> the story; it   restores the &quot;single player&quot; paradigm of the players being the center   of their own particular universe.</p><p>NWN is still quite far from completion, of course, and it's always risky basing   evaluations on such early specifications. Still, this is one game to keep an   eye on.</p><p><b>&quot;X&quot; - RICHARD GARRIOTT'S APOLOGY</b></p><p>Lord British has been batting about .002 for pretty much the past ten years   now, so you can bet that when he talks about his new project, it's with a certain   air of &quot;god damn it, <i>this </i>time we're doing it right&quot;. The funny   thing is, he might well be.</p><p>We can thank Ultima 9 for what information we know about X - in the wake of   that disaster, Garriott hit the interview subject really, really anxious to   change the subject, so he was positively verbose about what he's currently working   on.</p><p>&quot;X&quot; - purposely not Ultima X, and one can't blame him for wanting   to get away from Sosaria after spending pretty much his entire adult life there   - is, as described in purposefully vague detail, a massively-multiplayer game   with components of the single-player experience. In other words, like Neverwinter   Nights. <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/022/193/garriott_interview3.html" target="_blank">In   Garriott's words</a>:</p><p><font color="#77FF77">So with X, I've put these two types of games [single   player and massively multiplayer] together. For example, you start the game   in what I call a homestead&#8212;a place to build your house, hang the head of the   dragon you just killed, or meet up with friends and trade. When you want an   adventure, instead of doing it like Ultima Online, where a thousand people are   ahead of you and a thousand people are behind you waiting to do the same adventure,   imagine that the adventures are individual Ultima games with multiple people.   You go on these adventures that are custom-crafted from anywhere from solo player   to massively multiplayer and everything between. The adventures could be like   Quake Arena, where it's every man for himself. Or they could literally be solo-player   Ultima IV, where you go on that adventure alone.</font></p><p>Sounds good so far. Then you get quotes that make you   think Lord British's crown is on a bit too tightly. From <a href="http://www.well-rounded.com/games/reviews/garriott_intv_1.html" target="_blank">another   interview</a>:</p><p><font color="#77FF77">Garriott says he hopes to break new ground with X, taking   gaming to an area that, at first blush, sounds nearly impossible. "I want to   create a game that does not reward devotion," he says. In other words, time   invested in X won't necessarily equal advancement. Right now, in order to bring   virtually any gaming character to a level where you want to be (high level,   advanced spells, BFGs, etc.) you have to invest dozens and dozens of hours of   gameplay. It's something hard core gamers have come to expect, but it tends   to alienate casual gamers, a much bigger audience. Garriott says he hopes to   replace that required time investment with something else, though exactly how   he's planning to do it is something he's keeping close to his vest right now.   "Think of your best friend," he explains. "Your best friend is not your best   friend because he spends the most time with you." </font></p><p>And later:</p><p><font color="#77FF77">"I want to put the ability to put real money in a virtual   world," he says, with a proud smile on his face. </font></p><p>Put those two together and it's a pretty ugly picture.   At any rate, it's doubtful we'll see anything concrete about X in the next couple   of years. Still, it's interesting that apparently Origin is also aiming for   the ad-hoc group adventure model.</p><p>At any rate, UO2 should be the last of the &quot;throw enough players at the   screen and see what sticks&quot; model of game design. (And hell, considering   that we know absolutely nothing about UO2 save that it will probably look a   whole lot like EQ, it's hard to say what design decisions they're working under   anyway.) Which is as it should be - as the ORPG industry matures and more options   become available, one might actually be able to comparison shop gaming environments   and choose the one that suits their fancy, instead of choosing at random from   two or three that try to be all things to all people.</p><p><font color="#000000"><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000012.html">Got   something to say about this story?

After my last update many of you wrote in (or posted) to say either that you thought incentives were a good idea or that the very idea of <A href="http://www.uo.com/news.html">OSI offering incentives</a> made you ill.  Incentives, as many proposed them, could be anything from amnesty for past wrongdoings to a novelty item without substance.  However I have a third option for you.  What if incentives could be something far less tangible?  What if offering incentives was as simple (and complex) as establishing a good relationship with the player base?<br><br>Lets talk about Twister for a sec. Twister posted bugs but he actually found very few of them by himself. Yet people sent him bugs all the time.  They knew these bugs would be posted openly.  They probably realized that OSI themselves would read the site for information about bugs.  So since they would be posted openly and since they knew OSI would read about them there, why not send them to OSI?  In other words, what made Twister so special to them and OSI not so special?  He created a relationship with the portion of the player base that is adept at finding and testing bugs.  OSI has failed to do this.  As a matter of fact, they've done the opposite. They have shunned these people.<br><br>But they've even done worse than that.  IMHO they've failed to create a relationship with the majority of their player base.  Oh sure those of us who post on boards and run events have some sort of relationship with some of the game staff, whether it be Counselors, GMs, Cal, or whomever. But we are a very small minority of the actual player base.  I doubt we comprise even a tenth.  What about the rest of the people?<br><br>About a month ago I started seeing posts for Counselor of the Month contests on the European shards.  These were publicized on COB and on the Vault.  My first thought on seeing these was "OMG how unbelievably hokey."  Then after I considered it a bit longer I thought "You know, this is kind of neat."  As I continued thinking about it I thought that I'd never seen anything like this done on Great Lakes, Atlantic, or SP (the other shards I play on) nor would I be able to make an informed vote if there was such a contest.  I don't have the foggiest idea which counselors or GMs are assigned to my shards.  Do you?  I'll bet most people don't and that's a damn shame. How much effort would it take to put up a page on the UO website that listed the counselors and GMs assigned to each shard?  If it had the hours they'd be working that would be even greater.  <br><br>Lets take this even further.  When was the last time you saw a GM or a counselor in the game just walking around, seeing how people were doing and stopping to answer a question if they could?  So you say they'd be mobbed?  Why?  Because they only show up once in a blue moon and when they do show up they are standing outside the west Brit bank? Well no shit, Sherlock.  This might come as a huge surprise but players do frequent areas other than Britain and banks in general.  Walk the road from Minoc to Trinsic sometime.  You'll see lots of people.  Never a counselor though.  Or a GM.  These people only come when you have a problem.  Welp folks, I think this is a bad way to build a relationship with your customers.  I'm not talking about sitting around in the Counselor's Guild either.  That's stupid.  I'm talking about getting out there and meeting and talking to people.  But while we are talking about the Counselor's Guild -- wouldn't it be nice if there was always a counselor on duty in the guild to answer a question?  Wouldn't it be nice to know that if you had a quick question you could just bop over to the Counselor's Guild and you could COUNT on a counselor actually being there?  God forbid a representative of OSI should really be in that empty building awaiting the chance to help a customer.<br><br>I'll take this even further.  Counselors and GMs should know who the veteran players on their shards are.  If you live in a neighborhood for 2.5 years you get to know the owners of the corner store.  And they get to know you.  Because you've been a regular customer for 2.5 years. They let you slide if you are a dollar short because they know you'll be back tomorrow or the next day.  They greet you by name when you walk in the door.  They know what brand of cigarettes you smoke, if you will buy beer or diet coke or whatever.  They know you.  You have been a long-time customer and you are treated accordingly.  With OSI you are a number.  Gee thanks folks, don't do me any favors.<br><br>Once upon a time I played a game called <A href="http://www.gamestorm.com">Legends of Kesmai</a> (LOK).  The beta ran for almost a year and had been in production for about a year when it was announced that the game would run on AOL as a separate game.  So of course we all ran over to AOL to make new accounts and new characters.  Don't ask me why -- it seemed like a good idea at the time.  Anyway when we got to AOL I discovered that some little twerp had gone and taken MY name.  Myschyf is a game name I've been using for 7 or 8 years now (maybe 5 years at the time) and all names had to be unique in LOK.  To say I went ballistic would not give you the true depth and feeling of the wrath I unleashed on the LOK boards.  I had a good idea of who had done it and I threatened this person with everything from personal dismemberment to continual harassment.  So I was out hunting one day in the game trying to build enough skill on my character to eventually wipe out whoever had done this heinous misdeed when who should appear beside me at that moment but the player-liaison  person for LOK.  She had seen me enter the game and wanted to talk to me about the person who had 'stolen' my name and what KesCo could do to help me.  She knew I was pissed, knew why, empathized and asked me not to do anything too horribly stupid until she could check into it.  Now THAT'S customer service!  They didn't solve it.  They couldn't.   There was absolutely nothing that KesCo could do about it and she knew it and I knew it.  But the simple fact that they cared enough to come talk to me about it helped more than words can tell you.  THIS is the level of customer service and player relationships OSI should aspire to.<br><br>When someone tries to contribute to this game -- whether it be an idea for a quest, an idea to make the game better, or simply reporting a bug, OSI should at least send them a letter thanking them for their contribution and not some lame-assed form letter either.  A real, honest-to-goodness letter written by someone who can take the time and trouble to at least make the player believe that OSI really does give a shit.  <br><br>OK enough for today.  This thing is too long already.  As always, feel free to post your comments <A href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000011.html">here</a>.

Just when you thought the boys at Verant technically could <i>not</i> get any more lame, we get word of this letter sent to the folks at IGN, the also-quite-lame folks running the "Game o'the Millenium" poll won at the last moment by Half-Life, which is now officially more important then Chess, Checkers, Poker, and Doom:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Hello, <br><br>My name is Gordon Wrinn, and I'm the Internet Relations Manager for Verant Interactive, Inc., the developer of the massively multiplayer game EverQuest. <br><br>We've had some concerns raised here about the poll that is currently running at <a href="http://pc.ign.com">http://pc.ign.com</a> for the Readers' Choice Game of the Millennium. As of 4am EST, EverQuest had a decisive lead over Half-Life, with EverQuest having over 30% of the vote. As of 2pm EST today, Half-Life now has over 30% of the vote. <br><br>We are wondering if you will be doing a search for duplicate IP addresses before finalizing the poll results. We've found that it is possible for someone to delete the cookie on their system and vote more than once, leading to the possibility that the poll has been tampered with. It is the only way we can explain the massive "swing in customer opinion" this late in the poll, where the percentages should have already been representative. <br><br>I look forward to hearing from you. <br><br>Thank you, <br><br>Gordon Wrinn <br>Internet Relations Manager <br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</font><br><br>pc.ign responded thusly:<br><br><font color="#FF77FF">We're working on it right now, but it actually seems like the Half-Life community banded together to try and stop the push made by Everquest the day before. While we understand your concern, it's obvious by the push that your own company made to get close to 10,000 votes in one night, that it is possible for a group to make a tremendous difference. So far, the total number of our votes fall well inside the norms for a standard traffic day and our tech personnel found two bots running (one for Half-Life, the other for Everquest), but eliminated them before they could change the poll's results. It seems a bit funny to me that you consider yesterday's poll results to be representative when the day before your game was trailing in fourth place... We didn't have a problem with that "shift in customer opinion," why should we suddenly worry about this one?</font><br><br>So, you know, exhorting your fanatical 150,000+ customer base in game and on logon screens and the <b>fucking patch server</b> to go vote in this (did I mention this before) incredibly lame-ass poll is just <b>OK</b> but if <b>some other game</b> manages to match your efforts, <b>cheating must be involved</b>.<br><br>Make it all stop, mommy.

John Smedley, Lord High Poobah at Verant, posted to the official <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">Everquest forums</a> that in conjunction with the opening of 1 to 2 announced new servers (um, guys, that would be either 1 or 2) <b>characters from Fennin Ro (the oldest EQ server) would be allowed to transfer to the newer server(s).</b> Here's some of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/014231.html">what he has to say</a> on the subject:<br><br><font color="#FF77FF">1) We do recognize the problem on Fennin Ro (it hit 2600+ people tonight) and we are actively putting into place a plan to fix it.<br><br>2) The plan involves allowing people on Fennin Ro AT THEIR OPTION to move to a new server that would go up very soon (no ETA yet). Please re-read that last part.<br><br>3) Yes, they would get to keep their items, but beyond that we don't have enough details to give out yet. We do think it would be neccessary to limit it to X number of people (still working out how many) so people that would move would have to be 100% sure they were willing to go. It would also involve completely moving EVERY character a person has on that server, not selectively moving 1-2 characters, otherwise there wouldn't be much of a point.<br><br>Give us a few days and we will announce all the details, but this isn't something that we plan on waiting very long on.<br><br>Also - AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT - we do see other servers getting more people on them as well. We're going to be putting up 1-2 servers very soon here and we hope this will really help. Please keep in mind we want to see how things go on Fennin Ro before we make any other plans. </font><br><br>Note that the EQ message boards are on a very overloaded server and you may have to [Reload] 3 or 4 times to view the thread.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem948122038,4546,"></a>

<b>Is reading all this just <i>too hard?</i> We can help. <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/myschyf1.ram">Click here</a> to hear Myschyf read her latest update to you. --Lum</b><br><br>Good morning class.  Today's topic of discussion is bugs.  Not those creepy, crawling things you find hopefully outside and not inside but the kind you find in UO and don't report to the development team but do report to your favorite bugsite so that you, along with your fellow abusers, can be banned.  Because you know OSI has to get their information from some place and if the players are only reporting bugs to bugsites guess where OSI is going to go for their information? <br><br>Let us think about this for a moment.  Why aren't the players reporting bugs to OSI?  Well, why should they?  To protect the game and themselves.  Ok I'll bite.  That's a good reason and it works very well as long as you are talking about a dupe bug or maybe a house break-in bug or even a bug that will raise stats and/or skills above the cap.  But what if it is something more innocuous -- say a bug that will allow you to raise strength.<br><br>Since we don't want to talk about current bugs let us talk about a bug from days gone by.  Once upon a time in UO no one had strength above 70.  Well a few did but it was a very few.  You could mine all day and all night and never gain a point of strength.  You could cut every tree in the Yew forest and still, no strength.  Then one day one enterprising young player discovered that if you repaired a non-breakable weapon over and over and over and over and over again you would gain strength.  Overnight every man, jack and woman in the game became a blacksmith.  If you didn't have a forge (they weren't add-ons in those days -- they came with the house) you went and bought one (small forges cost like 10k back then).  All of a sudden everyone had 100 strength and life was good.  Now what possible reason would any of us have for reporting this bug to OSI?  Strength gain was broken (still is IMHO) and all of a sudden here was this marvelous new way to gain strength.  It didn't hurt the game or a players gameplay -- on the contrary it made it infinitely more playable.  YOU try fighting a drake with 66 hits and staying alive all at the same time.  So why would any of us report it?  What possible incentive would we have?<br><br>Ahh but that is a special case.  Thats only one bug and it is understandable why you wouldn't report THAT bug.  OK lets talk about another bug from days gone past.  Once upon a time in UO magic didn't affect you if you were wearing leather armor.  Oh it did some marginal damage -- maybe 4 or 5 points.  So of course all of a sudden everybody, everywhere ditched bone in favor of leather because mages, then as today, ruled the earth, the sky, the dungeons, PVP and PVM.  So why would a player report this bug?  Oh I don't know -- maybe because plate is sexy and fashionable and s/he really really really wanted to wear it?<br><br>It was <A href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/lumnooz/arc0-2000.shtml/">Runesabre's letter</a> of a week or so ago that started me thinking along these lines.  Even though in that letter he wrote specifically about people who ran bug sites, it seemed to me he made an assumption that the players SHOULD be reporting bugs to OSI and I thought, well, why?  Why should we?  We really have very little incentive to do so.  <br><br>Lets think about your average player here for a moment.  Not the readers of this site and certainly no one from Lum Inc. (because as you know we here at Lum Inc. are safely snuggled up against Tyrant's ass and ALWAYS report bugs).  But your average player probably doesn't read this site or any of the fan sites -- including bug sites.  The average player has probably never called a GM.  The average player probably never noticed that it was the leather armor he was wearing that protected him.  He just saw everyone else wearing leather and figured it was the fashionable thing to do.  If he did manage to put two and two together he probably thought it was neat.  I guarantee you his first thought would NOT have been to go running to OSI to tell them about the bug.  If I was not an employee of Lum, Inc. it wouldn't be my first thought either.  <br><br>However, this isn't actually a 'bug' problem, per se.  It is something larger -- lack of a relationship with the player base.   The failure of OSI (or any game company) to provide incentives for reporting bugs is possibly something that could be solved or wouldn't even be an issue if we, the player base, had an actual relationship with OSI.  One that was encouraged by OSI and even built by OSI.  Right now, most of the interaction between game company and player is customer-driven.  OSI has made great strides in this area but they aren't there yet.  However, since I've already made you do enough reading and thinking for one update and since I'm already late for work I'll continue this train of thought in my next update.<br><br>And since I loved Ktalk SO much, you may post your thoughts <A href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000004.html">here</a>.

<a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">The Game Developers Conference 2000</a> is scheduled to take place from March 8 to 12 in San Jose, CA. Unfortunately, we at LumCorp aren't going to be able to make it because, well, you know, getting out to California on such short notice is such a pain, and it's really an industry-only function, and well, there's that whole <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/register/prices.html">$1500 entry fee thing</a>. However, we did get an exclusive look at some of the presentations planned for this important event!<br><br><b>COMMUNITY DESIGN FOR LARGE-SCALE GAMING WORLDS</b><br><i>Jonathan Baron (Kesmai), Amy Jo Kim, Raphael Koster (Origin), Brad McQuaid (Verant), Toby Ragiani (Turbine), Mike Sellers</i><br>Recently, a new kind of online game has emerged on the scene: the massively multiplayer gaming world. These titles allow thousands of simultaneous players to fight monsters, fulfill quests, develop a reputation, and live out rich virtual lives in an immersive fantasy environment. When it comes to running a gaming community, these games face special challenges. In this tutorial, learn what it takes to build, manage, grow and destroy a large-scale, persistent-world gaming community. This session discusses contacting a select group of people to beta-test your world by advertising "free game!" on the web, wondering why your beta-testers never submit bug reports, go to release and then be criticized for a bug-ridden product, find out that your users are actually making web sites about your game, try to communicate with your users on message boards and Usenet, change your mailing and later physical addresses when these lines of communication break down, and finally hire people from within your game to take your public relations hits for you.<br><br><b>EVERQUEST POST-MORTEM</b><br><i>Brad McQuaid, Matt Yaney, Bill Trost, Roger Uzun, Geoff Zatkin (Verant)</i><br>Developing Everquest was an incredibly complex project - and has matured into the most successful commercial online game ever. We'll talk about some of the controversial decisions we face on a day-to-day basis including deciding which class to nerf each week (including special random number generator tools we've developed for this purpose) and why, in retrospect, sending the contents of every zone unencrypted to the user's client may not have been the smartest of decisions.<br><br><b>THE IN-GAME ECONOMICS OF LARGE-SCALE GAMES</b><br><i>TBA (Verant, Origin and Turbine)</i><br>Subscribers of the three major online worlds today interact with one another in a medieval fantasy world. One very interesting aspect of these games are the inter-player economy. In many ways, the in-game economy is similar to a real world economy save for the absence of supply, demand, growth, and productivity. We discuss issues facing in-game economies such as the Skullcap Economy of Ultima Online (what happens when economic growth is dependent on who can craft the most efficient tailoring macro), the Mule Economy of Asheron's Call (what happens when there is no in-game storage beyond what a player can actually store on their person), and the No Economy of Everquest (what happens when nothing is ever lost or decayed). As a special bonus, attendees will be able to log onto Everquest's oldest server, Fennin Ro, to witness the spectacle of 1st level Warriors running through Freeport in full Fear Plane armor.<br><br><b>KILL THEM ALL, KILL ALL THE LITTLE BASTARDS NOW</b><br><i>Gordon Walton (Origin)</i><br>If you are planning on having an online game community, particularly if you plan to later throw out a large percentage of that community, you must come to this roundtable. Bring your ideas and experiences and we can talk about what has worked and failed in previous online game community police actions. Prepare to learn the secrets of maintaining an active, committed audience through tried and tested methods used by historical communities such as ancient Rome, Renaissance-era Florence, Russia immediately after the Civil War, and 1980's-era Lebanon. <br><br>Other presentations include:<br><br><b>NO, WE'RE NOT TELLING *YOU* WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON, EITHER</b><br><i>Raphael Koster, Rich Vogel (Origin)</i><br><br><b>GETTING A LARGE MONOPOLISTIC CORPORATION TO PAY ALL YOUR BILLS</b><br><i>TBA (Turbine)</i><br><br><b>WE'RE STILL HERE, GUYS - A LOOK AT MERIDIAN 59 AND THE REALM</b><br><i>Topic subject to change depending on continued existence of games</i><br><br><b>WE'RE GONNA KICK *ALL* YOUR MONKEY ASSES</b><br><i>Todd Coleman, Jeff Toney (Wolfpack Studios)</i><br><br><B>I SWEAR TO GOD IN HEAVEN, WE ARE NOT USING ANY ULTIMA 9 CODE</B><br><i>Starr Long (Origin)</I><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947981727,80701,"></a>

Quite a lot of activity on the ShowEQ front today. John Smedley, according to a letter posted by <a href="http://eq.drtwister.com/">Dr. TwisTer</a>, has stated that the only legal recourse available to Verant is to ban the accounts of those ShowEQ hosts who happen to be EQ players. In his words,<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The only punishment for that is of course being banned, and that's really as far as we can or will take it.</font><br><br>Needless to say web mirrors of ShowEQ popped up like wildfire, which is pretty amusing considering that it's a utility of use only to those EQ players who happen to have a Linux box on their personal LAN (and somewhat difficult to set up even then). However, as someone pointed out in a letter to damned near everyone, there's already a <a href="http://www.darkflame.org/dump.cgi/iprog?mode=EQSS">working Windows EQ packet sniffer</a>. And guess where it's hosted?<br><br><a href="http://eq.stratics.com/items">Stratics</a>.<br><br>Apparently it's being encouraged to be used to help Stratics collect item data for its item database. Needless to say, if ShowEQ makes Verant foam at the mouth, this one (which DOES run on Windows), even though benign in intent, should make Verant convulse on the floor. Especially since the <a href="http://www.darkflame.org/eqitem_s.zip">source code</a> is available. Which could, concievably, be used in conjunction with the ShowEQ Linux source to, um, make ShowEQ Windows. Which I presume is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/eqelite/">already in the works as we speak</a>.<br><br>Of course, if you don't want to go to all the bother of actually running ShowEQ, some folks already went to the trouble of pulling out <a href="http://www.k2.org/">all of EQ's NPC data</a> for you. Wasn't that nice of them?<br><br>Verant has some fires to put out, it seems.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947867415,32962,"></a>

Several issues are on my plate at the moment. Rather than drop updates like bombshells, I thought it best to borrow an idea from Larry King, and share a few brief thoughts in digest form. My therapist tells me I talk too much anyway. If you're looking for another KTalk to run amok in, you can stop right now. More on that later.<br><br><b>Dragnet</b><br>They exploit, they get banned, and they cry foul. But when the dust settles, they mock those of us who remain.  <i>"UO will be dead in a year. They're going to lose a lot of money over this!" "Keep sending OSI your ten bucks, suckers!"</i> What I can't quite understand is why these people didn't share this opinion until after they were banned. In fact, while I might still be paying and playing Ultima Online, it is the exploiters who display the highest forms of rampant fanaticism for the game. All I do is log in, fish a little, bard a little, and maybe drink some fine fake ales when the sun goes down - but exploiting a bug for higher gains? Sorry, I guess I'm just not that into it.<br><br><b>Entrapment</b><br>Some have begun wondering whether or not OSI has knowingly baited exploiters with rumors of bugs, so they can ban them in massive "sting operations." I seriously doubt OSI is doing this. I prefer to believe that OSI finds bugs, OSI fixes bugs, then OSI "watches" to see who tries to use those bugs. Nobody to my knowledge has been forced into exploiting bugs against their will. But even -if- this were true, I personally don't have any problem with that.<br><br><b>Single White Female</b><br>They look alike, they sound alike - but something here is very different. Once again, the UOA vs UOE debate has reared it's hoary head. One of them is an approved UOPro utility (for those who don't remember, UOPro was the program designed by OSI for the purpose of carefully inspecting potential 3rd Party utilities for reverse engineering into the actual UO client). One of them is not an approved UOPro utility. One of them is legal, adding features that are like gravy on french fries - they don't sound like much, but once you try them, you're hooked for life. The other is like heroin on french fries - it's pretty awful, but before you know it, you're willing to risk everything for more of it. I leave it for others to decide which is UOA and which is UOE. The official party line from OSI is: "If it allows you to perform a function not possible using the client (fastwalk for example), then it will not be approved for UOPro status (i.e. backwards engineered into the client).<br><br><b>Dumb and Dumber</b><br>Consider it retired as far as I'm concerned. KTalk, more accurately called KiddieTalk, used to be a good thing. It bordered on the unreal sometimes, but most people found it entertaining, and interesting.The users were perhaps a bit "colorful" at times, but it was a place where people knew the fine line between the juvenile and the infantile - and didn't cross it. But cross it they have, impersonating regular contributors, name calling, impersonating OSI staffers. I personally found it to be at the low end of the "junior high" maturity zone, but I tolerated and participated in it's discussions.<br><br>Today, in a feat of stupidity I have yet to find a match for, someone posted a heee-uge assed post using the penultimate fuckhead plug-in utility: an automated "reply generator". Thanks ever so much for proving to the world that the "fuckheads" of KTalk were indeed NOT the lowest form of human existence, as had been previously reported. No, they have been promoted in the food chain, looming just above the "junior Fuckhead" and his reply generator. Hate them or laugh at them, the so called "fuckheads" of KTalk at least had the brains enough to post their own materials! Not so anymore.

Actually, I should have used <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/">Ron's</a> politically correct term "fuckheads". You may remember in his witty and almost coherent rant of a couple days back where he mentioned that, like it or not, most of our audience is missing quite a few chromosomes.<br><br>If this were a typical news site, the staff of LumCo would probably be ensconced in an IRC room somewhere (the 21st century's version of "lets do a meeting") trying to puzzle out how we could firewall these idiots without pissing them off. I mean, we need as many regular visitors as possible to ensure that our readership keeps growing, right?<br><br>Fuck THAT shit. I hate to break the news to you and you AND you, but I personally couldn't give three shits if you ever came back. You all pretty much proved in the last week that using an unmoderated forum was too much maturity for you to handle. From impersonating other people (including Calandryll, who wandered into kTalk completely by mistake), to those incredibly brain-dead "FIRST POST!!!!" wastes of bandwidth, to the latest flaming asshole who decided to post Lou Gerstner's mission statement into the last kTalk for god only knows WHAT freaking reason, one thing is obvious.<br><br>This site is too goddamn popular.<br><br>So let's get some ground rules set up. I don't want you people here. No, this wasn't a decision jointly arrived at by the other writers you seem to enjoy so much. <b>I</b> don't want you people here. I don't want to spend <b>my</b> time amusing <b>you</b>.Go wander off somewhere else. Thank you.<br><br>Now. If for some unknown insanity you are <b>STILL</b> here (and remember, I don't want you here) you are going to have to follow some simple rules of politeness. First off. kTalk is gone. Forever. I went in yesterday to try to add some new security features to it, but finally decided, fuck it why am I bothering? I am spending <b>MY</b> valuable time trying to make life easier for idiots who can't even be bothered to write their own goddamn flames. Screw that. If you want to pop off, there's a forum over in ----> that menu. Yes, you have to register. Waah fucking wah. And you know what, I plan on moderating the SHIT out of it. You thought the WTFman forum was run by Nazis? I got them trumped; I plan on running it as a Stalinist. They killed more people, so obviously their system of moderation is superior. And if you REALLY piss me off, I'll shift to a Khmer Rouge system of moderation and just kill everyone and use the skulls to run our nation's economy.<br><br>The Rantings Of Lum The Mad - "What the hell are you still doing here?"<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947758033,57873,"></a>

You people must be slacking.  Obviously <a href="mailto:sunsword@uo.com">sunsword</a> doesn't get mailbombed enough with free pictures of gay animal sex or something.  I say that because he's asked for input about a proposed party system.  I can only hope that he has a decent filter system on his e-mail client, because god knows what actually useful e-mail he might miss the deluge of posts screaming "who cares about the party system bitch!  Get rid of stat loss!".  No matter, here at Lumcorp we pride ourselves on our inability to keep our big yaps shut, so here's his message with obligatory commentary and editorial nonsense at the end.<br><font color="#00CC00">There has been a feature missing from UO since before it was launched. I remember that as a beta tester one of the first things I wanted to see added to the game was a party system. I wanted something that let me easily identify with other players, communicate with them and coordinate with them. I wanted something that didn&#8217;t require the kind of commitment associated with a guild. I wanted a Party System.</font><br><br>"And now that the reign of Koster lies in ruins I shall gain all I desired!  The fools at the University called me mad when I wanted a party system!  But I'll show them!  I'll show them all!"<br><br><font color="#00CC00">I wanted to be able to talk to any of my friends when they were in the game, at any time, without task switching. I wanted to be able to see where they were, anywhere in the world, so I could FIND them and meet up. I wanted my friends to be able to get my equipment off of my corpse without taking a reputation hit. I wanted to be able to cast spells on them easily, without mis-targetting. I wanted to be able to enter a dungeon with six of my buddies and work together as a team to clear the monsters out.</font><br><br>Monsters?  Oh yes, those obstacles that get in the way of the slaughter fests we call dungeons. Allready I have to wonder if he means the same thing by "party system" that the rest of us mean when we say that.  You see, we already have a communication system.  It's called ICQ.  We already have a way to find the location of fellow players.  It's called UOAutomap.  Does anyone but me remember the last time they tried to replace ICQ?  They spent months devloping that UO Chat program that gets less use than a "Frankie Goes to Hollywood" album.  Or perhaps we can go for a more recent example of those bizzare "greeting cards" that everyone had to disable due to numerous crashing incidents.<br><br>What's needed in a party system is far more simple then he makes it out to be.  We need to be able to retrieve our dead friends goods without "JoE NoTo" jumping out of the woodwork.  We need to be able to share experience points.  A way to share loot might also be nice.  It needs to be quick, easy to use, simple to get in and out of and to not crash our system.  The last might seem obvious to you and me, but sometimes I wonder about the water supply in the office building.  I'm just saying is all.....<br><br>I understand the urge to build new features into a project.  I've been guilty of it myself in the past.  Let us not, however, lose our focus about what the party system should be.  There is no need to reinvent the wheel.  If the dev team has that much free time, let them work on combat balancing, or perhaps even Necromancy.  Trust me, there is plenty of things for you people to be doing besides yet another failed attempt at cross shard communication.<br><br>One thing that cannot be doubted is that a party system is a priority.  With the development team dedicated into splitting the lands between "Act like an idiot without fear of being smacked" and "The days of the Dread Lord" one can close a number of future loopholes with a simple party system.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">Let&#8217;s get this party going!</font><br><br>If somebody brings the hookers, I'll bring the beer.   <br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947739111,25259,"></a>

While on the subject of unconfirmed bugs....<br><br>Yesterday I began hearing rumours of people running the test client dying, and then being insta-resed without being able to choose for themselves.  Now since stat loss is generally considered to be a bad thing, I decided to do some digging.  I recieved reports of two different people having this problem. One of the players told me this:<br><br><font color="#00CC00">It was a full insta res loss I lost about 9 to 8 in all my 7xGM I talked to GM Khensu he siad there was nothing he could do I was running the test client.. but not at the time of the glich.. I had it the day before.. but took it off cause of bugs. i sent in a concern already</font><br><br>Late last night I sent an e-mail to Calandryll asking him what he knew.  He wrote back:<br><br><font color="#00CC00">Can you have these players e-mail me?  I have not received e-mails from anyone about this...I just checked my entire e-mail box, including old mails.  I know Jalek got one (and only one) report about this and he is working with that player now.</font><br><br>Well and good, except that I know that there were at least two people affected by this.  Now, both players have assured me that they sent in their concerns. (I won't, BTW, blindly foward e-mail people send me.  Just to put your minds at rest.  I may not have many standards, but I do have a few.  Lum let's me stay anyways.  What a sweetie.) Earlier this afternoon, Jalek, who wrote the test program, had this to say on CoB after someone wrote in about their friend having this problem:<br><br><font color="#00CC00">The only report I have gotten was from one person and I have not heard back from him. The client shouldn't rez people unless they click the "Ressurect with penalties" option. As far as your friend, he/she needs to email me and tell me what happened so we can figure out what is going on.</font><br><br>Finally I recieved an e-mail from yet another person an hour ago wanted people to know the following:<br><br><font color="#00CC00">Sunday night, 1/9/2000, my best character died. He had GM magery, and also the GM Eval Int that is so hard to get. It's no big deal if he dies, but I couldn't believe what happened: he somehow insta-ressed! I had been using Jalek's test client. I have always used "Assume play as ghost", but somehow installing Jalek's client turned OFF that option. I got the menu to choose ghost or res, and suddenly there I was, ressurected on the spot with penalties!</font><br><br>Allright, that makes at least three in my mailbox, and at most likley a mysterious fourth person out there.  The question then becomes, what in the name of Lum is hapening here?  Jalek and Cal says one person, I've heard of three. Although Cal makes me, on occasion, mad enough to put my fist through the computer due to his vaugness, he is an honest guy.  This leaves us with a couple things to ponder.<br><br>Either there is one person involved and the other two are making the whole thing up OR Cal and Jalek are hiding the extent of this bug OR what we have here is a faliure to communicate.  I suspect the third.<br><br>Is there a bug with insta-resing and the new test client?  Call me cynical, but my answer is yes.  If you have ever installed the test client, try not die before this is straightned out, will ya?<br><br>For those of you who have allready experienced this, here's what you have to do.  E-mail Calandryll and Jalek.  For my own curiosity, let me know as well.  Despite what the "OSI is the devil" contingent might believe, I'm sure that ALL parties want this resolved as quickly as possible.  In the meantime, let's be carefull out there.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947727625,5484,"></a>

Here's a letter I just got on the bug that started this all. Unedited, unconfirmed, take it for what you will.<p><font color="#77FF77">1st, osi didnt track when someone did the money bug , because first they didnt know about the bug, 2nd the bug was over a year old so i dont think they "knew about the bug for awhile" like they say...unless their programmers are really stupid.. so what did they do? they just fixed the bug after a loser emailed skunkworks the bug to get his crap account and made it so that if u tried to do it after it was fixed, it would "flag" (osi loves this word) you and send a little signal to them...how do i know? because out of about 10 ppl that have retried the bug and have  icqed me saying it didnt work anymore and it was fixed....im the only one out of them that didnt try the bug AFTER it was fixed, and im the only one not banned. <p>2nd, the bug and the loser, !@$@!in losers. the bug was working perfectly, the money bug, untill some loser sends in the bug to xsploitz skunnkworks whatever the hell it is, and about 12 hours later the bug is fixed. This bug i am told was over a year old of ppl using  it and now some loser sends it to skunkz for a crap account. but i guess i shouldnt complain about the guy who sent the bug in, its probably the SKUNKWORKS GUY WHO POSTED ITs fault..... so anyway @$!@in tell ppl not to release bugs to bug crap websites. at least try and get osi to give u a freaking free year or 2 of uo for free for giving THEM the bug... jeezus. thats what pisses me off. losers who have no brains. anyway here is the details about it:<p>u could make literally 1 million in 1 hour.

It looks like we are seeing another mass banning. Here's an excerpt from the banning form letter one received.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">We have recently discovered that your account has been engaged in exploitative activity within the Ultima Online service. These logged actions have shown that you have attempted to employ the selling exploit with illegal third party utilities. As neither such utilities nor actions are permitted within the service, we regret to inform you that at this time we are permanently closing the account.</font><br><br>I have two different reports on what the exploit is. One report is that the exploit alters the client stream to fool UO into thinking you are selling five item when you are actually selling one. Another report is much the same, but that the client is tricked into thinking an item is exceptional when it's not, and getting more money for it.<br><br>Either way it's a pretty goddamn stupid reason to throw away your account. Folks, Origin is tracking this stuff. And as we saw from the scroll bug bannings on Siege, they <b>will</b> track to see if you try to use the bug after it's been fixed (I'm told the UOE bug was fixed this weekend.) And they <b>will</b> ban you. At this point, Origin is more concerned with restoring its zero-tolerance policy towards exploiters than the $10 a month it loses from them. <br><br>Too bad that decision wasn't made two years ago.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947716443,88589,"></a>

The following was just added to UO's <a href="http://update.uo.com/">In Testing</a>:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">House Placement<br>A new system has been created to ensure that houses are not placed outside of the house placement rules. The system will do thorough checks when attempting to place a house. <br><br>The house placement system includes the following: <br>* Various checks to ensure the house meets the housing requirements, including whether it is on level ground. <br>* Provides the ability to preview an area with the deed to see if the area is valid. <br>o Once a position is chosen, you will be told whether the area is a valid location or not. <br>o If the area is valid, you will be asked if you wish to place the house. <br>o If the area is not valid, you will be given a message telling you why not and you will not be able to place the house in that location. </font><br><br>Now if we could get a secure method of transferring houses, that would be ideal.

Remember ShowEQ? Sure you do. It's the packet sniffer for EQ that shows you everything in the zone to the /loc point, levels, hit points, yadda yadda.

No, not by fixing their client so that it doesn't suck up every possible location of every mob in the zone in an unencrypted packet. That would be <i>too easy</i>.<br><br>No, instead Verant has tried to shut down every single site that offers ShowEQ for download.

All those <a href="http://uovault.ign.com/">OTHER sites</a> are reporting BIG NEWS that UO2 will actually be using its own engine. Cynthe reportedly posted on UO Horizons that "it looks, like, rilly cool, man." (I'm taking <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/">Voodoo Extreme's</a> word for this one since I couldn't actually find the message in question.)<br><br>This is just sad. That isn't news, it's like a Daikatana site reporting what John Romero had for breakfast. (Huevos rancheros, mmmm, spicy!) Since there is so little news actually coming from UO2, and what few websites that actually reported some news were <a href="http://uo2.drtwister.com/">sued out of existence</a>, we decided to do what <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/">our detractors</a> accuse us of anyway, and just start making some shit up. So here's some UO2 NEWS!<br><br><b>PK SWITCH.</b> The UO2 developers have <i>changed their minds</i> and installed a PK switch into the game. Upon pressing the "Logout" button, the character will then become invisible to all other players and <i>totally immune from any attacks!</i>. The fact that that character cannot actually be played or gain skills during this "special invulnerability" is a small price to pay for such a cutting-edge feature.<br><br><b>PORN.</b> That's right, <i>gigabytes</i> of nudity, both male and female, will flow into your screen in full 16-bit color. Characters will have a special skill, tentatively called <i>Usenet</i>, that will allow you to select what type of porn you would like to download. A special program accessed in-game, called a <i>news reader</i>, will then download the porn you request. With EA and AOL-Time-Warner-CNN-CCCP now in a strategic alliance, this can only be a brilliant marketing opportunity, with certain well-endowed models being "branded" in more ways than one!<br><br><b>VIRTUES.</b> That's right, in a development sure to <i>set online gaming on its head</i>, the UO2 staff has actually figured out how to model virtuous behavior in the game! Speculation is rampant how this was actually accomplished, but a little gremlin inside Origin tells me that "people will actually be able to interact with one another, and in so doing have the opportunity to behave in an ethical manner towards one another." Those of you who've played UO1 know what a great leap forward this is for the Ultima Online franchise!<br><br><b>MOVING A LITTLE BAR FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.</b> Some things <i>will</i> stay constant in UO2, of course. Many RPG fanatics demand the ability to make a little bar move from left to right, sometimes even <i>as a result of actions taken in game!</i> The UO2 developers hear you, and the rumors out of Austin are that there will be <b>several</b> little bars that you can move from left to right during the game! This of course is just the sort of cutting edge game theory we've come to expect from the industry leaders.<br><br>More to come. You DON'T want to miss out.

In the aftermath of Ultima "don't call it Tomb Raider because the Avatar doesn't have breasts" 9 disaster, a number of folks on the Ultima 9 discussion board have begun to wonder, what exactly has has happned to Lord british?

I don't think it's healthy and I wouldn't wish the kind of negativity I've seen in here on anyone. I don't believe that the participants in this forum will treat him appropriately. I think posts such as yours only validate my thought.  have recommended that he make a new Words from Lord British and leave it at that. I honestly feel that is the best course of action.</font><br><br>Well, yes.  If I had released U9, I might go into hiding myself.  Still, one has to marvel at the dedication of MOI to take a bullet for Richard.  Such dedication is rarely seen outside of the secret service or religious fanatics.  You see, he really would love to talk to all of us...it's just that mean old MOI lady.<br><br>Of course, there is no law saying that a creator must allways respond to his fans..or in this case his newfound enemies.  Hell, if I was him I would be locked up in my castle with a high powered rifle and scope.  Besides, it's not like we won't hear from him ever again....I'm sure by the time Ultima X comes out, we'll hear plenty of of reasons why Ultima 9 was "poorly recieved".

<font color="#77ff77">I believe the removal of precasting will utterly destroy PvP. As of right now, the tank mage class is equal, if not worse in a duel, than a well-equipped melee fighter. Precasting adds flavor to dueling; it makes PvP what it's supposed to be--fun. The addition of the effect of dexterity on healing gives the melee fighter an even greater advantage. Isn't it the dev team's goal to preserve the balance of the game, rather than destroy it? Personally, I have made a 7xgm melee fighter (maces, tactics, anatomy, resist, healing, magery, and parrying with 100 strength, 95 dex, and 30 int) and a 7xgm tank mage (swords, tactics, magery, resist, eval int, meditation, and wrestling, with 100 str, 100 int, and 25 dex). The tank mage cost me 534,000 gold pieces to make, yet the melee fighter cost me only 323,000 gold pieces. Judging by price alone, the mage should be more dominant. However, you will be forcing the PvP community to play these *boring* melee fighters if you actually do take out precasting. Why do I say *boring* you ask? Well, playing a melee fighter involves almost no skill, it's basically just connection & equipment vs. connection & equipment. This makes a very boring duel, one that makes me consider playing other ORPG's. Please take these facts to heart. The dev team will create irrepairable damage by putting this patch into effect.</font><br><br>Shadow of Sonoma (from <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cob/devboard/messages/9656.html">CoB</a>)<br><br><br>The above was the most coherent defense of precasting that I could find in a short search. So let's take a look at this.<br><br>First off - duels vs free-for-all combat. I enjoy PvP in UO, in fact that and the virtual economy are the only reasons I play. The monster AI in UO is a joke and bashing on helpless terathans or whatever from above a cliff is just utterly boring to me. <br><br>That being said, I have never "dueled" in UO. The whole thing just seems artificial to me - and, dare I say it, a refuge of those who are frightened of being outnumbered. So I'm writing this from the position of someone who doesn't duel. I realize this probably disqualifies my opinion for the more rabid among you.<br><br>So. You have an artificial situation already. Now, thanks to UO's current skill system, you have two universally agreed upon archetypes - tank mage and dex monkey. And, if you believe the proponents of precasting, tank mages are <b>only</b> competitive if they are allowed to essentially get in a free hit - a precasted e-bolt/flamestrike/what-have-you.<br><br>Now, let's call this what it is - a free hit. It's not balancing, it's not "honorable", it's not "justified", it's an artifact of bad client programming. In popular parlance, a "bug". (BTW, I've heard from Origin that <B>NO ONE</b> is or will ever be banned for precasting, so those particular wild rumors can stop now.) <br><br>If the tank mage archetype requires a free hit to be competitive, <b>that is a problem with the tank mage archetype</b>. What you should not be demanding is leaving in precasting - what you should be doing is looking at the combat system that makes that archetype uncompetitive.<br><br>Now, let's look at PvP from another angle, the well-balanced group. In a good PvP group, each member of your team has a role. You have mages assigned to healing. You have mages assigned to paralyze duty. You have nukers (ebolt/flamestrike). And you have the melee team members who keep everyone else busy.<br><br>Using this team-based model, pre-casting is pretty irrelevant. I mean, in a good team, you have 2 or 3 nukers already blanketing someone with mana dumps, so they're not going to try to be wading in with free hally hits anyway. They're too busy. If they're trying to engage in melee, they're not doing their jobs - plus chances are they're only wearing leather armor or less anyway for the meditation benefit. <br><br>You can call this gang-banging if you want, but I've fought in battles outnumbered using this system and almost always came out victorious - and the times we've lost, it's usually because one of the mages thinks he's a tank mage and decides to waste valuable time wading in with a hally or something and gets killed. It's called tactics, and it's more than just a skill on your character, but a skill USING your character.<br><br>Again, all of the above is useless for those of you who duel one-on-one. Maybe you can just let someone get a free ebolt before starting or something. It seems about as realistic as precasting.<br><br>Now, this isn't to say that the UO combat system is not in need of a complete overhaul. It is. Archery is worthless in PvP now, for example. Specialization skills could easily be added. Say, Targeted Archery for archers - allows them triple damage or triple speed with bows if maxed. Of course that's 100 less points against the skill cap, too. The more of these the better - and maybe someday we'll see more than Tank Mages or Dex Monkeys on the field.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947512825,93900,"></a>

I hate polls.  The reason I hate polls is that usually the few short answers that comprise the poll don't fully encompass my feelings about the issue.<br><br>When Lum threatened to take Ktalk away before I wrote him and asked him not to.  I thought Ktalk was fun -- that it was interesting to see what other people wrote.  Of course Ktalk then was a bit different than it is now.  It was more of an extension of the forum than just another place for Twister rejects.  However as I read the responses to the posts made over the weekend I noticed my feelings about ktalk have changed somewhat.<br><br>Last night I sent a letter to Lum and the other members of the Lum Squad because as I was reading the responses to Runesabre's letter I was struck by the differences between the forum and what goes on in Ktalk.  I mean pretty much what was posted in Ktalk is just the Twister Defense League and other assorted "UO Sucks, Rune Sucks, Kirk Sucks, Fuck you" type of posts.  Not the intelligent discussion Lum's site is known for.  Not a discussion befitting the lead programmer for this game we all know and love.  Not a discussion at all really.  <br><br>Then there were the responses to the Greybeard/Great Bob/Lum boxing match.  "Greybeard r00xers U"  "Greybeard owns u" "U suck" "Fuck U" (I shudder to think that one day it might be acceptable English to spell "you" as 'u').  In any case I could have gone a whole year without hearing any of that nonsense and never missed it.  Intelligent discussion?  I think not.  <br><br>Ahh and how could I talk about this subject without mentioning the responses to my little rant about Galad's site.  Good God you would have thought I was going to take away someone's favorite GI Joe from the vehemence of the responses.  'Galad's site r00xXers you and Myschyf is a lesbian who wants to suck off Jerry Falwell!'  Oh yeah that logic flows.  'I love Galad's site so get off your liberal highhorse you oriental bitch from hell.' I love conflicting opinions. Sorry I pissed in your Wheaties kids ------ NOT!   <br><br>I'll admit I find the forum much more interesting and had stopped reading the Ktalk responses before Lum dubbed me part of the Squad and made me feel it was my duty to read them.  So maybe if I didn't feel I had to read this crap I could ignore it and wouldn't feel like I'd like Lum to take it away.  That aside I think Ktalk has reached the end of its usefulness.  The type of writing found in Ktalk isn't what I came to Lum's site for and I'll bet many others feel the same.  My vote goes squarely into "It's useless, get rid of it."<br><br>With that said, there is no Ktalk page along with this rant.  You want to comment on what I just said?

Well, it seems <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/">Greybeard</a> wants to keep on flagging a dead horse. Since we all know that the internet is the pinnical of rational argument, I'm sure a few words on my part will allow this to die a well deserved death. First let's get some background, shall we?<br><br>I recieved a somewhat illegible piece of mail detailing a tale of woe and outrage that Greybeard had gone mad with power. The writer went on to point me in the direction of the <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/hb/">Honorbound</a> web site and Greybeard's quote regarding macroing. The writer was also kind enough to point out to me Greybeards own words on the subject when he was playing. I got a chuckle out of it, and wanted to share it. Why? Because it contains within it a wonderfull truth about life. All of us have grown up and allowed the fire of youthfull rage to simmer. When the fires die, we find ourselves doing things that we would have found abhorant as teenagers. For me it's the little things, like sending to my employees a procedures manual that I would have crammed up someones ass when I was young, angry and working tech support. It's catching ourselves complaining about the loud music the damn kids are listening too, when we once blared Black Flag on our radios. It's waking up to find that the shoe has gotten on the other foot...and sometimes it's not that comfortable.<br><br>For two years we have listened as Greybeard has railed against those who imposed rules upon the players. We laughed at the exploits of Greybeard and his cronies as they raised the flag of anarchy, and threw feces at those would try to force them to play the game in any other way then the way they wanted to. When a player was jailed for 24 hours, or given a warning, Greybeard would be the first to complain about the injustice of it all.<br><br>It's not about the macro debate. It's not about system rescources. It's about poking a bit of fun at a fact of life.  You see, when you spend two years complaining about people enforcing a set of rules, it's only natural that many would find fun at watching you enforce the rules yourself.<br><br>The funny thing is, I actually am in full support of Greybeard. I firmly believe that if you bring the toys, you get to decide upon the game. If people don't like that game, they can get their own toys. It's just that simple. For years Greybeard has complained about the game. I, for one, am glad he finally got toys of his own.<br><br>Look folks, here's a situation where Greybeard deletes a characters belonging for macroing. His defense, I felt, is entirely correct. If people are idiots and not listening, sometimes you need to kick 'em upside the head to get them to pay attention. It raises the question though, what if this had been done by OSI? Somehow, I doubt he would have been so sympathetic.<br><br>So when I posted that little tidbit, I assumed that Greybeard could see the humor in it as well. Imagine my surprise when I found out that he couldn't. Not as surprising as finding out that <a href="http://www.lunarden.com/bvnews/news.shtml#947265900">Fear</a> had allready posted the same story, but surprising never the less.<br><br>That's where we are. First Greybeard responds, then Fear responds, then <a href="http://www.thechosen.com/">Jinx</a> gets involved, then Lum defends one of his writers, and finally Greybeard responds again. At this rate, it'll be a topic on "Meet the Press" within a month. What rubbish. It was a cute little story that resonates within all of us. Irony is like that. Sadly, some people just don't get it. No amount of words in the world will ever convince them, and that's too bad. It's also not my problem, and it shouldn't be anyone elses. If Greybeard wants to says things like "the updater in question you hired was an untalented idiot who plagiarized a story that was pretty ignorant in the first place" that's fine.  Hell, send me some money and I might even pretend to care.  I'm easily bribed.

It was my intention to make the move official early next week, but Gamestats, who hosted my site, got ahold of my domain name transfer and decided instead to take my site down and transfer people logging onto the site to another eq site.  Thus those who try my old domain will instead find themselves at maximumeq.  The domain has not yet transferred, but it will be <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a> when it gets transferred, hopefully early next week.

I figured I'd better pop off on this one, since the Butt-Naked Avenger saw fit to show his ass in our general direction (I suppose that comes with the butt-nakedness and all). Let's hit this point by point.<br><br><b>I AM SO NOT A HYPOCRITE</b> Bzzt. Just because you have a shard with 500 people running on a PC does not mean that you are somehow immune from any charges of hypocrisy, power-tripping, or copyright violations. It just means that you are a hypocrite, a power-tripper and a plagiarist on a <i>smaller scale</i>. I know this may be hard to fathom since it involves higher mathematical functions like division and multiplication, but 1500 macroers tying up CPU cycles on an Origin shard has about the same impact as 50 macroers tying up CPU cycles on your little utopian paradise.<br><br><b>LUM SUCKS BECAUSE HE HAS OTHER PEOPLE WRITING FOR HIS WEBSITE</b>... as opposed, of course, to the one and only one person writing for wtfman.com, I take it.  I mean, that would just SUCK if different people posted updates to wtfman.com. Obviously you would have to have delusions of grandeur to do something like that.<br><br><b>LUM AND FEAR BLOW OSI STAFFERS</b> Leaving aside for a moment Greybeard's oral fixation (what, did LadyMOI promise you Ultima 9 would work or something?) the accusation remains that both Fear and I are homosexual because we are actually polite to Origin's folks when they poke their heads out from their shells. <br><br>I realize politeness may be foreign to Greybeard, being a sign of adulthood and all, but even leaving that aside, do picture the following interview.<br><br><i>Runesabre</i>: Hi, Greybeard. Thanks for having me on your website.<br><br><i>Greybeard</i>: Fuck you. You think I sold out to the MAN or something? Bring back precasting, you lame shit. And get rid of statloss while you're at it. And get me a beer, bitch.<br><br><i>Runesabre</i>: What the fuck, man? (leaves)<br><br>So you see, it's only from <b>pure self-interest</b> that we act like reasonable human beings and not flaming hemmorhoidal assholes when dealing with the folks who actually work on this crap for a living. It's one of those cause and effect deals. You know. Like when you steal from someone and they get pissed and turn grey, then you can kill them. I hope that's a metaphor you more fully understand. (By the way, a metaphor is a way of expressing an idea.) <br><br>I like Greybeard. Hell, I even like Ronald McDonald, despite his constant entreaties for hot monkey loving. (Nighthawk scares me, but that's OK. I think it's the tribal mask.) But in case you folks haven't noticed, this is the week I am not taking any shit. <br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947374558,5816,"></a>

Recall back in July when he said "I would even go so far as to say that the day I log in and find that I&#8217;ve gotten a ban (even as short as 24 hours) for macroing, is the day I cancel my account"?  Well, I sure did.  Oddly enough, he might not have.  You see, Greybeard is now GM for a private shard called <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/hb/">honorbound</a>.  He recently sent this message to his players;<br><br><font color="#00CC00">"Folks, you have GOT to keep abreast of the rules. I amazingly am still coming across people macroing. Dont think that  because you are hiding under a tree in the middle of the woods somewhere that you wont get caught. Fact is that you will be found no matter where you "hide". Now, originally the plan was to immediately <br>ban you on the spot when we caught you,  but the three guys I found yesterday and today, I was generous enough to "only" wipe their backpack (including deleting their newbie box) and their entire bank account. Gold, keys, runes, reagents, kiss it all goodbye. TwinkleToes managed to macro up 1.5 archery skill yesterday and it only cost him 70,000 gp and 3000 reagents to do so. What a bargain eh? We are NOT fucking around with you and will not tolerage gimpy bastards flagrently disregarding our rules. Our generosity will soon be coming to an and you can expect accounts to start getting axed quick, fast and in a hurry in the near future over this.</font><br><br>Well, I guess if you're not a rebel at the age of 20 you got no heart, and if you are a rebel at the age of thirty you got no brain.

God, kTalk is SUCH an enlightening place lately. In between the various posts on what a lame fuck I am for having other people post their opinions (which is supposed in some twisted way to convince me to post more?) we get notes such as this:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">: This website has run amuck with you nazi roleplayers and your god damn opinions on pvp, something you don't even participate in. Stick to staying in your towers with some gay guy with a female character emoting sex acts to each other. </font><br><br>Emote THIS, motherfucker. With such idiots running amuck (this was probably the calmest of the many postings) why the hell would anyone <b>care</b> what the hell your opinion is?<br><br>First off, no one fucking <b>ASKED</b> you about precasting. It's a fucking <B>BUG</b>. I am so sorry if you built your entire gimp 7x GM Tank Mage around it. DEAL. <br><br>Second off, when the Lead Fucking Programmer of Origin (I think that's his job title) gets on the horn and asks "Hey, did I fix skills or not?" this is NOT your cue to say "Fix precasting you punk ass bitch!". Because even if somehow Origin would be convinced NOT to fix that bug (which they're not) somehow I doubt people acting like lame-ass suburban imitations of DMX, only with a high-pitched nasally voice and no balls, would convince him to look sideways, much less actually do what you ask.<br><br>I think you idiots seriously are starting to have reality issues here. Just because you run around UO emoting "ass rap3d y0u! B00yah!" does not mean that this sort of behavior works in real life. <br><br>God, with the intellect being shown off lately maybe we should just chalk up all ORPGs as failed experiments until the gaming public makes it to puberty.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947292237,14127,"></a>

Hello.  My name is Lietgardis and I'm one of those "lonely people that post on message boards late at night," to fit into my fellow Great Bob's categories of Lummites.  <br><br>The children of the Ultima Online community sadden me.  They really do.  A day of reading and reloading the <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cgi/cob/devboard.cgi?view">CoB Dev Board</a> is enough to make anybody fear for the future role of player input in online gaming ...<br><br>Our good compatriot at Origin, <a href="mailto:runesabre@uo.com">Runesabre</a>, was kind enough to post <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cob/devboard/messages/8845.html">a message</a> asking for feedback on the Test Center skill advancement changes.  At the time I write, the direct replies include eight insults (including one that eloquently states "suck it" in the topic line), five off-topic posts ("GIVE US PRECASTING DAMMIT!"), and three helpful responses.  Two of the helpful responses were written by the same individual.  The helpful responses didn't really include any in-depth information on what Runesabre was asking for, but the intentions were good.<br><br>What do you think this ratio of helpful/not helpful means?

Yes I'm an updater. Please don't let my non-Lum status distract you. I am currently 2 semesters into the pursuit of my Associate of Lum degree, for which I'm required by curriculum to serve as an intern. Forward all complaints to <a href="mailto:lum@xrgaming.net">The Office of Dean Lum</a>.<br><br>As for the topic at hand:<br>Last night, we were blessed with yet another Open House. For those of you who don't know, Open House is where we can find answers to some of the most asinine questions to ever percolate from a human brain. Why don't we use the potty in UO? Why, indeed!<br>What follows is a summary of last night's event, including my own little opinions thrust about in machine-gun form.<br><br><font color="#77FF7">Q: The 6 month plan is awesome, but can you do fifty thousand other things for us that aren't on the list, while still getting the list completed in 6 months?<br>SunSword: In a word: no. To further explain: no.</font><br><i>It would appear that the East Coast connectivity problems are not on the 6 month plan. Atlantic and Chessy should be stable sometime around Easter, one would hope.</i><br><br><font color="#77FF7">Q: Do you plan to take out minor rules in the house placement requirements that are silly, such as grasses blocking placement?<br>SunSword: We are examining how silly we are at the moment. If we change it, we'll let you know.</font><br><i>Meanwhile, you will still find yourself unable to push beyond a starling without full stamina.</i><br><br><font color="#77FF7">Q: Will the new PVP/non-PVP zones affect the existing Reputation system?<br>SunSword: Um, we don't have a goddam clue. We will eventually let you know as soon as we know ourselves.</font><br><i>SunSword didn't really say 'goddam'. SunSword also didn't really answer the question.</i><br><br><font color="#77FF7">Q: Will you fix monsters so they walk around rocks?<br>tOAD: yes<br>SunSword: I can't answer that<br><br>Q: Will new lands be on the map, or a new map like T2A?<br>SunSword: I can't answer that.</font><br><i>I believe at this point, SunSword is a channel bot. I can't confirm that and when questioned later, his answer was "I can't answer that"</i><br><br>That being just a taste of the session, I have to question the need to stage a "press conference"  covering topics you either have no answers for, or cannot divulge the answers you have. If you hold an Open House about the vaunted "Six Month Plan"; perhaps the dev members present should be prepared to answer questions about that particular topic. If they are not able to do so, perhaps another topic is in order. Something like, "Things we won't even think about until Spring 2000." Personally, I'm still curious why I can't run past a starling when a titan and 3 murderers are on my heels.<br><br>The answers my friends, are blowing in the wind.<br>They certainly aren't <a href="http://uohoc.stratics.com/logs/pub000106.htm">here.</a> <br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947240341,61697,"></a>

On Day Two of the Downfall of Lum the Mad (mark your calendars), we saw a snippy little exchange by the developers of AC and EQ on bug smashing. In his now-Y2K-compliant <a href="http://staff.turbinegames.com/letoile/">web page</a>, Chris L'Etoile talked a bit about how Turbine would deal with exploiters:<br><br><font color="#77FF7">Let's be realistic here; if there's a dupe bug, it's our own damn fault that it exists. If you report it to us and we ban you, that will only lead to fear and resentment of us. If someone is banned for being honest, you probably won't tell us about the next exploit you find. Why the hell should you, if we're just going to put a cap in your ass?</font><br><br>Most of you are reading this and going, "Gosh, what refreshing honesty. I'm going to go out and buy 12 copies of Asheron's Call RIGHT NOW." <br><br>Sorry, that's bullshit. I don't know of ANY ORPG that bans people for reporting bugs. EQ, UO, hell, even Meridian 59 doesn't ban you for <i>reporting</i> bugs. They ban you for <i>exploiting</i> bugs. (Which is what the Mercs, AC's gift to the PvP community, have been rumored of doing on an industrial-sized basis.) <br><br>It's an important distinction. One Turbine apparently <i>decided not to make.</i><br><br><font color="#77FF77">I'm not saying that the Mercs didn't abuse the dupe bug before they reported it to us. We simply don't know, and at this point it's water under the bridge. From a detached, practical, Machiavellian perspective, it only makes sense that someone would exploit a loophole as much as they felt they safely could, then make sure it's closed behind them. </font><br><br>Well how touching. I mean, they're just misunderstood, right? Anyone would exploit as much as they could given the opportunity.  They shouldn't be punished... I mean, they did have the decency to tell Turbine about the dupe they found after they had gotten their use out of it so that no one else could!<br><br>When you lie down with dogs, expect other people to point at you and call you "dogfucker". There is no such thing as an honorable exploiter. <i>These are the people trying to destroy your game.</i> You don't reward them with publicity, you kick them the hell out of your game.<br><br>Brad McQuaid of Verant had the following to say about the subject on Usenet:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">We do NOT ban people for reporting bugs, we ban people for exploiting them.  We deeply appreciate players who report bugs, especially nasty ones like dupe bugs.</font><br><br>[Chris posted on his page that another ORPG developer emailed him with advice on how to deal with exploiters, namely booting them the hell out. Brad verifies that it was someone from Verant.]<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I didn't send the email, another person at Verant did.  But in any case, it's pretty typical for people in the games industry to communicate, hang out at trade shows, call each other, etc.  My understanding of the email that was sent is that it was meant as advice in terms of how to handle exploits.  Competitors in this industry are typically not so cutthroat that we don't offer each other advice on matters.<br> <br>I've met many of the AC and UO team members and they're all great guys regardless of whether or not we agree philosophically in terms of game design. In fact, we typically have much more in common than not in common -- the passion and dedication to making great MMORPGs and furthering this emerging genre is shared across the board.</font><br><br>Yeah, everyone in this business loves each other. Hell, even us dorky little rant sites email each other all the time with little notes saying "what the fuck are you doing? Updaters? Are you bonkers?". <br><br>Still, we couldn't finish out a Stormwaltz update without a gratuitous slam at the retarded uncle in the attic no one talks about:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">When developers and players treat each other with a policy of honesty and fairness, everyone's life is better. Our relationship with you should never be adversarial. Once we start down that dark path, forever will it dominate our destiny, as it did Lord British's apprentices.</font><br><br>My friend, you could learn a hell of a lot about dealing with exploiters from those apprentices.

As you may have noticed, I've hired some new writers for the site in my vain and futile attempt to keep you pinheads amused and in an alpha state, clicking on banners without really knowing it. Of course, this didn't go over well, because, as we all know, <b>you are stupid</b>.<br><br>I could just stop here and watch Victoria's Secret TV ads, slackjawed. But no, for some reason I can't really understand, I feel the need to explain myself. (Not to you, though. It's a more free-floating need.)<br><br><b>I HAVE A LIFE.</b> I know it's hard to believe, but I really can't play three online games to a state of Zen perfection, monitor every single web-based bulletin board that mentions EQ, UO, AC, SB, HJ, AO, and/or Canada, monitor the response time of emergency units within a hundred-mile basis, explore the limits of the female orgasm, record pithy notes meant for the eyes of our secret masters that rule over us all (I speak, of course, of Puff Daddy) and STILL write for this site. Something has to give. And it ain't gonna be Puff Daddy, cos he's MEAN.<br><br><b>SIZE DOES MATTER</b> Just ask the Russians. In World War Two they found that, being the largest country in the world, they were able to retreat further and further into the hinterlands, throwing the best and brightest of their generation into the fray like cardboard, until, at the very end, Tom Hanks and Matt Damon arrived to save the day. The message is clear - if we post enough updates, <b>Oscar-award winning actors will save us</b>. You don't seriously expect me to give up on that promise. It wouldn't be fair to the children.<br><br><b>I AM NOT DR. TWISTER</b> I feel this is a somewhat obvious point. For one thing, Dr. Twister never felt the need to use the word "fuck" in an update. And I have solemn promises from all the writers (NOTE - do NOT call them updaters) that they will curse like a sailor cut off from his grog ration. That alone sets them apart from the TwisTies. That, and the fact that if any of them close out an update with the words "Peace Out", I will not only pull their access, I will send Pam Grier to dispose of them. Because I have to be hard, but fair.<br><br><b>IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD</b> Despite what some <a href="http://www.thechosen.com/">desperate, histrionic sites</a> would have you believe, my every word is not blessed by Divine providence, fit for study, guidance, and emblazoning into huge glyphs atop Mount McKinley. In fact it is occasionally beneficial to read the opinions of those other than myself. I realize this is not an easy concept for many of you to face, but if you ever expect to take those first loping steps out of your parents' basement and approach an actual living member of the opposite gender without causing constant and uncontrolled screaming by either of you, this is a leap of faith that you must, you <b>will</b> take.<br><br>So give them a chance. Let the new writers soothe you with cooling balms and potions, while fanning you with their command of the language and their cunning knowledge of Jeet Kune Do. Because, as the Reagan Administration taught us, ketchup is in fact a vegetable. <br><br>Thank you, and good evening.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947207276,78473,"></a>

Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn recently announced that, starting today, he'll be writing the EQ Patch messages. Here's today's from the Test Server. I must say it's a damn site better than "Necromancer Feign Death spell enhanced" like we would see previously...<br><br><font color="#77FF77">January 5th, 8:30pm <br>------------------- <br><br>Well, we have finally completed the hardware maintenance on the Test Server - which took quite a bit longer than we expected. Due to this hardware failure, some characters were restored from backup therefore a few hours of gameplay may be lost for them. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused. <br><br>The following changes have been introduced to the Test Server. <br><br>- Druid's Tracking skill base has been increased. <br><br>- The behavior of the Necromancer's Feign Death spell has been modified on the Test Server. Here's a description of the reasons behind this change: <br><br>Problem: <br>Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances, providing offensive tactics that are abusive. For this ability to remain balanced, the pet should follow the same rules as invisibility. Offensive tactics used by other classes involve the creature getting a saving throw verses the effect. Since creatures do NOT get a direct save verses feign death (as you cast it on yourself), and since you can retry the combat once you have feigned death, there is very little risk to necromancer himself. As this tactic involves charming an NPC and turning it against another NPC, which could be part of the same spawn, it allows for Necromancers to solo MUCH bigger rooms than any other class could. This situation is well beyond what would preserve game balance for any other class (soloing the Bloodthirsty Ghoul room and Ghoul Lord room, for example). <br><br>Example: <br>While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death tactic is abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul Lord room of Lower Guk. The room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards and the Ghoul Lord himself. Using the current system, a level 50 Necro can easily solo the room at virtually no risk to himself. The Necro can get into the room quite easily with Invis To Undead. To clear the room he uses Screaming Terror on one Bok and Charms the other. When the Ghoul Lord rushes him, he feigns. The Lord then turns on the charmed Bok and kills it, taking considerable damage during the fight. The Necromancer waits until the Ghoul Lord returns to its spawn point. When the necromancer gets back up, he is in no danger of being attacked due to the way Feign Death works now. He then charms the 2nd Bok and Feigns again. The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok is killed. When the Necromancer gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul Lord AND nearly full mana. The Lord is now an easy kill, and the necro collects his special items. <br><br>Solution: <br>Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets suicide and the charmed ones break Charm. We do not want, however, to adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree. What we do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necros from exploiting key spawn points. Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately break Charm. However, summoned NPCs (pets) will NOT be affected. While this still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet, it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that charming an NPC does. <br><br>We would appreciate diligent testing of this change, to insure that no unforeseen problems have been caused by it. <br><br>-The EverQuest Team</font><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem947099412,75465,"></a>

<img src="http://lum.xrgaming.net/hotties.jpg" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10>Topic today is sex. There, figured that'd get your attention.<br><br>Check out this story from EQ:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I have a good friend who speaks to me often about the amount of attention she receives with her wood elf druid(s). On one server, a GM (!!!)(and yes, she actually checked for his name on the roster) actually approached her (he at level 50, her at 1) and started to hit on her when she said hi while walking by. They talked for a bit, and before she knew it he was 1) handing over a crap load of stuff and 2) asking her to marry him when she reached level 20. This was after her char had been alive 30-45 minutes, all but 5 of which had been spent talking to this GM. Now I will readily admit she is a wonderful person, and great fun to talk to, but isn't that a tad early in their "relationship" for engagement?</font><br><br>We've talked about GMs cavorting with female players before, but this is a bit much -- at least UO GMs try to, you know, actually confirm the person is female in real life first.<br><br>EQ is pretty bad about this, though. As a side effect of the generally good graphics, the female characters all suffer from Lara Croft Syndrome. As an object example, take the Half Elf Butt. No matter HOW much armor you throw on a half elven woman, she is suffering from some serious wedgie action. There's a reason the Nybright Sisters all want to kill you. They HURT. And let's not discuss wood elves. Especially the ones in leather.<br><br><br><br>This has an effect. Take this tale of how to win friends and influence people:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">This one happened to one of my guild members. She is a rogue and she was playing in Cazic-Thule for a while. Then all of the sudden, she got a tell from one of the guy who was in her CT group offer her a Raven bp [Ravenscale breastplate, rare Rogue-specific magic armor]. Well, it seems wonderful enough. I admited I am so jealous. But later on, I found out something about this raven bp deal. He asked her in order to get the bp, she has to <b>phone sex</b> with him. What a fricken loser. GRRRR. I don't see why people think Raven is god armor or something. Come on, we already have enough of KS'ers and eBay. Now, PHONE SEX? Mother of God, I want to screw this guy really badddd. AHHHHH. If I can get his name from her, I swear that I would do badddddd things to him. ARHHHHHHHH.</font><br><br>So we've established two (well maybe three) things:<br><br>(1) Men are scum. (you very rarely see women withholding rare loot for phone sex)<br>(2) Everquest's designers were men.<br>(3) Given (2), see (1).<br><br>Of course, there's the whole men playing female characters thing. I used to think that men did this solely to get free loot from people until I saw this note:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">...considering that 70% of the "women" you see are horny young men or dirty old men who toggle their view so they can stare at their wood elf character's ass...</font><br><br>Well, THAT made me feel creepy in a totally unique way.<br><br>And to close, let's hear from someone who really doesn't have a problem with any of this...<br><br><font color=#77FF77">Hey, but don't get me wrong I enjoy a nice bout of flirting every once in a while as long as its within it's bounds. Ladies don't deprive yourself of having a good time because of some silly horny 15 yr old! Lastly, if the dumb guys wanna give away their stuff, by all means, LET EM'! I say roleplay the HELL out of them... men on the server so much like in RL like getting used sometimes (not speaking for everyone) so take advantage of it! <br>Ps.. Verant I dont appreciate the silly skimpy outfits the ladies start off with as compared to the males!!!

You've seen <a href="http://www.thechosen.com/">Jinx's history of the Year That Was</a>, now here's my pithy Top 10 list of things we'd be better off forgetting.<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10:   SIEGE PERILOUS (UO)</font></b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it first was   announced, it seemed as though it were the Holy Grail of UO &#8211; a shard designed   to attract the best and the brightest, with as few artificial restrictions as   possible to get in the way of player versus player. Then, even before it began,   in a misguided attempt to stave off macroing, Origin began tinkering with the   basic ruleset (first making the most basic skill usage eat stamina, then implementing   Rate over Time) &#8211; moves which made the main target audience for Siege (rabid   PvP powergamers) throw up. As Siege progressed, those who weren&#8217;t in hardcore   PvP guilds were eventually driven away.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Siege still has   a large and thriving PvP community &#8211; but it could have easily been much more.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>9: NERFQUEST   (EQ)</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking of tinkering   with the basic ruleset, Everquest&#8217;s dev team has managed to piss off literally   every class in the game. Well, Rangers haven&#8217;t been nerfed yet. Then again,   the designer plays a Ranger. Think there&#8217;s a coincidence? Despite happy, Orwellian   announcements of &#8220;enhancements&#8221; to each class, the only class that has really   seen a net benefit to its playability has been the Warrior (which, before the   changes, was completely subsumed by the Ranger and Paladin classes). Druids   saw their ability to kite their way through levels taken away. In the process   Necromancers had their main offensive weapon (DoTs) nerfed as well. Rubicite   armor (the major high-level armor upgrade for almost all classes) were taken   away and replaced with class-specific quests. Warriors and Rangers could get   theirs done in an hour or so. Clerics might be able to get theirs in a month   of camping. Rumor has it there&#8217;s still a Paladin somewhere trying to get his.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Combined with,   until recently, an almost open hostility to the Everquest community (Verant   recently hired an Online Community Coordinator who is trying his best to imitate   Calandryll, albeit with somewhat more of a chip on his shoulder) half the game   in EQ seems to be divining which class the dev team thinks you should play.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>8: ASHERON&#8217;S   CALL (AC)</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Great game system.   It would have been nice if they packaged a game with it. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While many folks   do enjoy AC in its current state, the fact of the matter is that AC is incomplete.   The world is empty (new players can often be seen wandering around the newbie   spawn points wondering &#8220;what now?&#8221;), the creatures are basically palette-shifted   versions of 5 or 6 models (yes, you are still fighting drudges at level 40),   the much-vaunted plot is non-existent to most players, and the basic elements   of world persistence &#8211; player housing and crafting &#8211; are &#8220;due to be patched   in later&#8221;.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another one that   could have <i>easily</i> been much, much more.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7: DR. TWISTER   NERFED (UO)</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whether or not   you thought his UO site hurt the game (and yes, I think it did), Origin/EA&#8217;s   lawsuit was chilling in its implications. If Stratics had posted the UO2 files,   one suspects the lawyers would not have descended upon them with quite as much   venom in their beaks. The fact is that Origin saw an opportunity to shut down   a site that had been a thorn in their side for over a year, and took the shot.   </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One only wonders   which site is next in the sights. (*You see Lum ducking for cover*)</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>6: CUSTOMER   SUPPORT? WHUZZAT? (UO, EQ)</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You&#8217;d think that   staffing customer support with the same guys who actually play the game would   be a good idea. UO and EQ are test cases that show that this is not always a   good thing. UO&#8217;s GM staff has made some profoundly stupid mistakes (such as   deleting buildings of players they don&#8217;t like very much), although recently   they have shown signs of improvement. Thankfully, the EQ GMs and guides are   stepping up to the plate to provide more tales of customer abuse that you enjoy   so much.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>5: THE MACRO   POLICE (UO)</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a class all   its own, UO&#8217;s jihad against its own userbase ranks, well, number 5 in the list   of stupid things. Instead of actually changing the skill system so that it was   no longer profitable to &#8220;macro&#8221; skill usage unattended, OSI decided it would   just be simpler to ban everyone who tried. The result showed both UO support   and the UO playerbase at their finest, as GMs spent most of their time answering   calls from players &#8220;narcing&#8221; on their enemies in hopes of getting them banned.   </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If I had to pick   one decision to make that would most fuck with UO, telling the GMs to ban everyone   they see macroing would be up near the top of the list.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>4: RACEWAR SERVERS   (EQ)</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8220;No, really, PvP   in EQ can be cool! You see, let&#8217;s organize all the players into armies! It&#8217;ll   be fun!&#8221; Unless, of course, you don&#8217;t see the fun in res-killing, zone-killing,   naked magery, and all the other things that make Tallon Zek the least populated   server in any ORPG.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3: XPL0IT KIDDI3S   (UO)</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From just taking   the shards themselves down, to more selectively just deleting the houses of   people they didn&#8217;t like, the players of UO proved that they can be a greater   nemesis than any GM could ever hope to be. While some of the blame undoubtably   falls on Origin for releasing such a patchwork client, the fact remains that   there remains a hard core of idiots who get their jollies out of ruining your   online day.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2: CONNECTIVITY   &#8220;ISSUES&#8221; (ALL)</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There&#8217;s this thing   called the Internet, and some days it just sucks. At any given moment, out of   the 3 ORPGs I have accounts with, at least one, and sometimes two are unplayable   due to monstrous lag. Whether it be step-step-freeze in UO, watching the packet   loss number reach 100% in EQ, or walking through sludge in AC, lag is the one   undying constant that is the most irritating factor in any online game. Well,   except for&#8230;</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1: IT&#8217;S ALL   ABOUT THE BENJAMINS, BABY (ALL)</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No, Richard, the   corruption of an environment is <b>not</b> &#8220;cool&#8221;. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The worst excesses   of every online game can be traced to one word &#8211; eBay. The worst customer support   incident? GM Darwin, creating shake and bake towers and gold for resale on eBay.   The worst player scandal in UO? Guilds that dupe gold for resale on eBay. The   worst playability problem in EQ? The item farmers that block every lucrative   camp so that they can sell the proceeds on eBay.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is <b>the</b>   problem that ORPGs need to stare down in 2000. As long as items or property   or skills are so rare/difficult/impossible to obtain that an obscenely high   real world value is attached to them, those that see an opportunity to make   a profit will do so &#8211; to the detriment of those who simply want to play the   game. And those who simply want to play the game will find games to play that   don&#8217;t involve competing with those who see them as a brilliant career move.</font></p><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem946995932,2106,"></a>

<a href="http://uo.tradespot.net/">Tradespot</a> (formerly the UO Market) continues to be a lightning rod for criticism and controversy. Here's some words from one of its founders, Zamboni Driver.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Howdy all, Zamboni Driver here (no, not one of the 146 fake Zamboni Drivers who are trying to steal your gold, the real one).<br><br>I'd like to take this opportunity to reply to some of the allegations against Tradespot that have appeared in the fora on this site.  Here are the allegations, as I understand them:</P><p><blockquote> (a)  Tradespot is full of greedy bastards out to make a buck any way we can;<br><br>(b)  Certain members of TS staff are low-life scammer doodz who should be drawn, quartered and fired from TS (not necessarily in that order); and <br><br>(c)  TS doesn't always respond well to the needs of its customers.</P></blockquote><p>Here are my responses:</p><blockquote><p>(a)  When I started in the merchant website business (waaay back with The Trading Post, the precursor to UO Market and Tradespot), the website was pretty much all buy/sell ads for UO items. There was no housing resale market (no house ownership yet), there was no ebay market for UO (aside from duping, there wasn't enough of a gold supply in those days to support gold sales for cash) and life was simple.<br><br>Well, The Trading Post merged with UO Market (when our host site, the-egg.net got hacked and we lost all our files) at just about the same time that the big housing patches went in and all of a sudden there was a housing sales boom.  Some of us at UOM identified a big problem with the market - there was no way to do secure trades.  So, those of us who had already established a reputation in the community started to do some third party brokering - we'd act as the middleman on deals for a fee (5% of the value of the trade).  At the beginning, most trades were pretty small - even towers were selling for around 2M gp or so (now that's the average price for a legally placed large brick and it's almost impossible to buy a tower except for $ sales).<br><br>Over time, as the brokering service became more heavily used, we added a <a href="http://uo.tradespot.net/html/brokerfaq.shtml">Broker FAQ</a> to TS to explain to people how to safely conduct trades with a TS broker.  To my knowledge, NO ONE who has ever used a TS broker and who has followed the correct procedures has been scammed.<br><br>I have brokered well over 1500 trades.  Yes, I've made a lot of gold doing so - there's no denying that fact and, quite frankly, no reason to do so.  Without exception, all of my clients were happy to pay the fee (which is, by the way, less than 5% on big deals) for the security of a safe trade.<br><br>Keeping that in mind, I have been one of the biggest and most vocal proponents of a secure house trading system (check out my latest rant at <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/strat/wishlist.htm">Zamboni's Wish List</a>.) Our goal when we started to broker wasn't primarily monetary (although the gold was a nice side effect) - it was to help players.  I'm not claiming to be a tree-hugging-love-thy-neighbour-altruist, and I'm sure the hard boiled among those who read this spiel won't believe me, but that's the simple truth.<br><br>(b) I've always maintained an open in-box policy.  If anyone has concerns with a TS Broker or staff member, that person is encouraged to email those concerns to me at <a href="mailto:zamboni@tradespot.net">zamboni@tradespot.net</a>.  I always investigate the complaint fully and report my findings to the<br>complainant.<br><br>That said, people should understand that the benefit of the doubt goes to TS staff - people who have been chosen based on their reputations and their friendships with other TS staff; however, benefit of the doubt means just that - it does not extend to an assumption of innocence.<br><br>To date, no one has made damning accusations against Pucky (the TS Broker who's at the centre of most of the controversy) that have been backed up by evidence.  Until someone presents us with evidence that Pucky has scammed other players or duped in UO (an accusation that he's been cleared of by OSI), he will continue to be welcome as a TS Broker.  TS will not serve up Pucky's head just to placate a screaming lynch mob that can present no evidence.  If anyone has evidence (it doesn't have to be written proof - verbal evidence is welcome) that he or she would like to submit, please do so.<br><br>(c) On this last point, I'm forced to agree with some of our accusers.  TS hasn't always been fast enough in responding to the needs of our users.  As TS has grown (far beyond our original expectations), we've made some questionable calls and expanded too quickly to keep up with the additional work.  The area of TS which has suffered the most has been the Banner System - we didn't have a clear chain of responsibility for the Banners and consequently, when problems arose, everyone assumed that someone else was looking after them.<br><br>As we continue to expand, I'm sure there will be other problems - we never claimed to be (even close to) perfect.  We'll tackle those obstacles as we come to them, making mistakes along the way, but doing our best to serve the UO community.</p></blockquote><p>I hope that answers a lot of your questions about TS and recent events.  As I mentioned above, I'm always happy to chat about events at TS, in UO or in the world at large - feel free to drop me a line at <a href="mailto:zamboni@tradespot.net">zamboni@tradespot.net</a>.<br><br>Happy Trading!</p><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem946943275,94309,"></a>

I suspect the CoB Dev Board isn't Y2K compliant, because an honest-to-god <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cob/devboard/messages/2246.html">informative post</a> appeared, where Runesabre, UO's lead programmer, took the time to answer some interesting questions. In case it scrolls off the board before you get there, it's reproduced below.<br><br><font color="77FF77"><i>1) From practical game experience, my vanquishing collection went from 4 in approx 18 months of playing, to over 60 in 3 additional months.Would you agree or disagree that the SOS has become a blight on the magic weapon market of UO? <br>1a) If you agree, what are you going to do about it?<br>1b) If you disagree, what function does dumping large amounts of gold and items into UO serve?</i><br><br>1) I have personally loathed the day the fishing changes were done. If you recall, I was the one that "nerfed" the original implementation within a week after its release.  I am in favor and enforcement of reasonable Risk vs Reward. Treasure hunts were a good reward but I made sure that the risks and cooperation was pretty high as well. Fishing up free loot in the form of treasure maps and SoS's do not represent any sort of risk yet they are nearly the same rewards as treasure hunts.  That of course is where the players come in. My initial "nerfings" were not met with a very positive reaction and it was decided to relax the changes slightly. I still believe fishing is way too lucrative and does nothing but present a thorn in the economic side of UO. <br><br><i>2) What incentives do you plan to offer in the future for people not to own a house?</i><br>                                                                      2) That seems to me like asking what incentives am I going to provide for players to stay as a newbie. Owning a house is one of the big goals players strive for just like they strive for being GM in skills.  We have made adjustments to make owning multiple houses not necessary. That is why you can now place multiple vendors in one house ( as opposed to one vendor per house limits ), you can assign friends and co-owners who can have their own personal storage, and internal lockable doors. <br><br><i>3) What are your thoughts on gold sinks? If you like them, why don't we have more of them in the game? If you dislike them, then why?</i>                                           <br>  <br>3) Of course I want gold sinks. Their time allocation has not arrived yet in the whole scheme of things. <br><br><i>4) What are your thoughts on starvation? I'm confident that eating could be done in such a manner that it wouldn't be any more annoying than having to buy regs. Assuming you could, on a 1-10 scale, 10 being the highest, where would you put starvation as a priority.</i><br><br>4) I think Cooking has the potential to be just as fun and important to UO as Blacksmithing and Magery despite its current lack of luster. I have many ideas for Cooking but again its time has not been prioritized like so many other things we would like to do.<br><br><i>5) Do I actually have a Guaranteed Tower (tm) waiting for me in these new lands, or is that just a myth? It sure seems like everyone says there's going to be one there for each of them. What are you going to do for the highly disenchanted have-nots of housing after the "new land" patch?</i><br><br>5) Did someone say that everyone was going to have a tower? I am sure you realize that is a tad ludicrous and I doubt anyone seriously believes such a rumor. There will be significantly more housing, though, so those who have never had a chance to own a house can certainly expect their chances to be much much higher at owning one in the near future.<br><br><i>6) One of the worst things that can happen in UO, aside from being hacked, is to be scammed out of large sums of gold for a house. When, oh when, is secure house trading coming? Also, what about house swapping, as, with no gold sinks, it's hard to get someone to give up a house when you don't have a house already.</i><br><br>6) Its one of the top priorities.<br><br><i>7) You said many moons ago that stat advancement was troubling. What progress have you made on that front? Have you guys considered stat locks until you get a better solution? They can't be anymore out of context than skill</i> <br><br>7) If you work with skill locks enough you pretty much have stat control. You know which skills raise which stats so I don't see stat locks being all that necessary. But, the real reason stat locks do not exist is it would go against the idea of if you want certain skills you get their associated stats. You can't have everything just the way you want it. :) You can't gain snooping and avoid the dex or anatomy and avoid the int gains. If you want the skills you have to have the stats that go along with those skills.<br><br><i>8) You asked for input about hard-to-raise skills. After the input, what did you learn, and what potential solutions do you have? </i><br><br>8) Check out raising skills on Test Center right now. All skills that are non-difficulty based have been adjusted so that they raise both at low levels AND high levels. That was something I put in last night ( along with all the other latest developemts ) when Test Center went down a few times.<br><br><i>9) The basis for murder count decay timers was on the accepted fact that people macroed. Now that macroing is illegal, what are your thoughts on changing the decay concept, for those that were playing by the rules, then the rules changed?</i><br><br>9) The additional timers were put in because it was realized that 8 hours to wear off kills was not enough of a deterrant and not just for those with multiple accounts or those who macro.<br><br><i>10) What are your thoughts on purchasing skill training at high levels for certain skills? Not only would it curb macroing, but it would also act as a gold sink.</i><br><br>10) Its been brought up... as has been the side effect of "instant" characters by those who have more gold at their disposal than they will ever need. To stave off the abuse, the amount of gold it would cost would have to be so extreme that very few players would ever benefit. <br><br><i>11) Is beeswax a precursor to bow repair?</i><br><br>11) One of the designers is working on something related to beeswax but I forget what at the moment.<br><br><i>12) PvP balance is a touchy issue. From my perspective, you guys won't touch PvP because it would be time consuming to balance it, and you guys don't have time. Is this an accurate interpretation?</i><br><br>12) I would personally love to overhaul PvP in UO. Despite the fact its better than it has been in any time in the past, it pales to what I can envision PvP being. My goals are always for true, viable diversity as opposed to lots of choices but only a couple real true options for PvP. ( For instance, do I be a Tank Mage or a Dex Monkey? ). I want to see a lot more rock/paper/scissors related to PvP, I want to see all the weapons have their unique purposes depending on the situation, more choices and ramifications to using different types of armor ( leather armors could be more arrow repellant while plate tends to snuff magical ability for instance ). We have made a lot of tweaks here and there. One of the things that makes messing with PvP are all the side-effects one change can make. PvP is a web of interdependencies so there is rarely any true "I can fix/change this and bring everything into line" because in changing one thing you end up changing a lof of other things. Its come to where I believe you can't make just a couple magical tweaks and make PvP more balanced like we have in the pasy and most likely it would just be only slightly different and overall more of the same. I would like to see PvP have a complete scale of choices and tactics but such an endeavor would require much more than a couple tweaks and hope things stay balanced. So yes, time is one of the big factors for holding PvP changes back. <br><br><i>13) What is your view of a balanced PvP system? One in which mages/archers/meleeers/tamers/bards/etc all have an equal chance of winning, or is it a group dynamic?</i><br><br>13) Pretty goes with #12.<br><br><i>14) Tamers have a few built-it checks on their targeting so that they don't have to wait for the skill cycle to re-tame. How hard would it be to give this to bards?</i><br><br>14) No real thoughts.<br><br><i>15) The whole point to karma is as a role playing tool. It was stated as such back in the days of rep. However, to PvM and to have low karma are counter to each other. Any thoughts on a karma lock? Any thoughts on a "i kill monsters for pleasure" toggle so that we can kill for fame and not karma.</i><br><br>15) Karma is like stats... its not really an option you choose. If you kill monsters then you gain karma. If you do "bad" things you lose karma. What really needs to happen is more choices of "doing bad things" that will raise your fame but lower your karma that are equal to killing monsters. Perhaps more "good" creatures that still carry loot and such.<br><br><i>16) A looooooooong time ago, showing one's title was turned off, as a way, if I remember right, to make being a dread lord tougher, as you couldn't tell newbies from experienced players. UO is VASTLY different now, yet we still have this legacy hold over. Any thoughts of simply turning titles back on for all? If no, then why does one's ability to cast EV determine if you show title or not. You -have- to be a mage to show title, wouldn't you agree? If not, instruct me on how to show title without casting a spell.</i><br><br>16) Yes, just haven't gotten around to it yet<br><br><i>17) When in the 12 month timeline are you guys going to fix the house placing code?</i><br><br>17) You can try it out right now on Test Center. <br><br><i>17b) Is a house with a basement that is placed by clicking the deed, clicking the land, and having a house appear an illegal house or not?</i><br><br>17b) We don't have any houses with basements do we?<br><br><i>18) What are your views on the rare item market? Are you sympathtic to them, or do you want to put them out of business by making everything craftable. Where do you stand, on a 1-10 scale, 1 meaning you actually want to take some craftables out, 10 meaning you want every piece of art craftable.</i><br><br>18) Its not as cleancut as don't touch anything considered rare or make it all available. Some things ( like silverware ) should be craftable and I would say its not fair that they would be left as rare ( hence they became craftable ). We do not go out of our way to purposely screw the rares market and are more attune to it now. <br><br><i>19) On a "rare" item note, can you PLEASE delete all "a scrolls" from the game when you fix this bug? I don't want to hear this advertised as a rare item like no draw tiles. Heck, can you delete them too?</i><br><br>19) *chuckles* Personally I like the whole dynamics of things being considered "rare". Which would you prefer time spent creating more gold sinks or time spent deleting "a scroll" items? :) As with all things it boils down to time, priority and who is available to do the development.<br><br><i>20) As I've stated before, I think monster death will backfire, by putting more vermin in the dungeons than you can throw a stick at (see my attached pic, do you want to fight that?!?!?). How far along do you see a dungeon re-themeing taking place (if it's on the horizon) and if it does come along, will we, the playerbase, get a say in how it goes. For example, despise used to be a pretty good dungeon, now it's almost deserted. Is maximizing the playability of all dungeons a goal for you guys? (easy yes answer there).</i><br><br>20) Of course we want dungeons playable. Again, it comes down to ... well you heard that before.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem946746459,12515,"></a>

Tyrant decided to spend Y2K on our <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/cgi/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=General+Discussion&number=1&DaysPrune=5&LastLogin=">gimped message board</a>. Here's some excerpts.<br><br><font color="#FF77FF">Housing normally decays for people who leave the game (for any reason, including bannings). For the large exploiter bannings done recently we specifically deleted the housing and contents, with a couple of unfortunate exceptions. In the future, expect people banned to have the related possessions deleted in total rather than waiting for decay to occur.<br><br>People should not get new accounts after being banned. We no longer want their business and they will be banned again when discovered. Expect a lot of this activity early next year.<br><br><i>I heard you say on one of the Battle Vortex shows that you don't ban people that get new accounts after being banned, because some people change their ways (like me - I'm such a good boy).</i><br><br>We will grant amnesty for some previously banned people dependent on their current record and previous offenses.<br><br>Account hackers, exploiters and racists are not welcome at any time in Ultima Online.<br><br>P.S.
