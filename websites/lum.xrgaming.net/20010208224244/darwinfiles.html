<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">August, 1998: Kevin Roseler, then 
    known as &quot;Kanis&quot;, first surfaces via posts to Usenet <a href="http://www.deja.com/%5BST_rn=ap%5D/getdoc.xp?AN=377567451&amp;fmt=text">advertising</a> 
    a &quot;Napa Valley Shard Times&quot; website. One of the postings included 
    his ICQ number, which caused him no end of grief a year later. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">September, 1998: Kevin Roseler 
    hired by <a href="http://www.origin.ea.com/">Origin Systems, Inc</a>. as a 
    part time employee at the salary of $10.00 an hour; assumes the identity of 
    &quot;GM Darwin&quot;. He posted a few times the first week he was hired, 
    including <a href="http://www.deja.com/%5BST_rn=ap%5D/getdoc.xp?AN=386303414&amp;fmt=text">one 
    defending poor GM response times</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">September, 1998 - June 1999 GM 
    Darwin was, from all appearances, assigned to serve on numerous shards, most 
    often sighted on Catskills and Lake Superior. Most reports of his conduct 
    are positive; some players noted that he had helped them even after GM hours. 
    A few were less than complimentary, including <a href="http://www.deja.com/%5BST_rn=ps%5D/getdoc.xp?AN=419059289&amp;fmt=text">one 
    player that was told</a> in December that if he didn't like theives, he shouldn't 
    be playing UO. Another in January <a href="http://www.deja.com/%5BST_rn=ps%5D/getdoc.xp?AN=428407776&amp;fmt=text">complained</a> 
    that he refused to refresh a player's house, even though he was called up 
    by the military and was unable to himself. Overall, however, there are few 
    complaints, especially in comparison to other notorious GMs such as Carnox 
    and Cochese.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">May 29, 1999 - GM Darwin makes 
    his first purchase on eBay, as userID imagine691, which he later changed to 
    shopper691, with an email address from a large Austin-based ISP. This is later 
    changed to <a href="mailto:askmewhy@netscape.net">askmewhy@netscape.net</a> 
    after his termination from Origin. Over the next few weeks, according to <a href="http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewBidItems&amp;userid=imagine691&amp;completed=1&amp;all=1&amp;rows=25">eBay 
    logs</a>, he purchases 256MB of computer memory and some Mickey Mouse memorabilia. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 1, 1999 - GM Darwin places 
    his first auction on eBay, <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=111939807">a 
    large house and 2 million GP on Catskills.</a> The auction closes at $700.01. 
    He and his wife later state this was to aid a friend with financial and marital 
    problems and no personal profit was made from these and other transactions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 10, 1999 - Nighthawk, webmaster 
    of the PK-friendly <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/jov/">Joy of Villany</a> 
    website, is banned from Ultima Online by GM Boo for saying &quot;I love bashing 
    jap healers&quot;. This is deemed a racial slur. An hour later, his tower 
    is deleted by a GM, despite the fact that it was co-owned by many players 
    who were not banned. Protests from throughout the UO community, including 
    but not limited to PKs, begin. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 11, 1999 - According to GM 
    Darwin, the GMs are ordered by &quot;someone from upstairs ie. the dev team 
    or the community people said to unban him [Nighthawk] since he had all his 
    friends protest.&quot; Nighthawk is told that his punishment has been changed 
    to a 72-hour penalty box and that his tower will not be restored.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 12, 1999 - GM Darwin places 
    two auctions on eBay, <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=116789715">a 
    tower and 2 million GP on Napa Valley</a> which sells for $510.00 and <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=116795805">a 
    placed castle on Baja</a> which sells for $1,025.00. A day later he places 
    two more auctions, <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=117238189">a 
    placed castle on Napa Valley</a> which sells for $750.00, and <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=117239753">a 
    large house on Pacific</a> which sells for $611.00. His total proceeds for 
    the two days of auctions: $2,896.00</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 14-18, 1999 - GM Darwin places 
    several orders for computer hardware, also through eBay. He purchases a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=117792551">flatscreen 
    19&quot; monitor</a>, two complete PIII/500 systems (<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=118342044">one</a> 
    / <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=118519164">two</a>) 
    and a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=119807181">tower 
    case</a> as well as a failed bid on <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=118610992">another</a> 
    PIII/550. Total purchased in this buying spree: $4,212.00. His wife later 
    states that this was intended for and paid by his mother. Shortly thereafter, 
    he bids on another monitor, but the sale falls through as <a href="http://cgi2.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback&amp;userid=shopper691">both 
    call each other deadbeats in eBay complaint reports.</a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 16, 1999 GM Darwin had a busy 
    day. In addition to taking a call on a friend of Dr. Twister which is lovingly 
    described the next day on his <a href="http://members.home.com/drtwister/">website</a> 
    (apparently the corpse of a thief was changed from gray to blue after the 
    thief successfully placed a murder count on his killer, which should not have 
    happened), he places four auctions on eBay, each for 2 million gold, on <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=118879879">Chesapeake</a>, 
    <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=118880309">Europa</a>, 
    <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=118879879">Sonoma</a> 
    and <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=118880540">Lake 
    Superior</a>. Total take that day: $1491.38.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">July 17-21, 1999 The great majority 
    of <a href="http://members.home.com/drtwister/">Dr. TwisTer's website</a> 
    is taken up by polemics against GM Darwin, and &quot;the fools that OSI thinks 
    we are&quot; over the alleged corpse coverup.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 20, 1999 GM Darwin places 
    four more auctions up for bids on eBay, again 2 million gold each on <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=120527459">Pacific</a>, 
    <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=120527850">Baja</a>, 
    <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=120530082">Yamato</a> 
    and <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=120540566">Great 
    Lakes</a>. Two of them fall through, including one to <a href="http://www.forwardartillery.com/">T. 
    Elliot &quot;Myscha the Sled Dog&quot; Cannon</a> of <a href="http://www.epicgames.com/">Epic 
    Games</a>. They both <a href="http://cgi2.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback&amp;userid=shopper691">complain 
    that he was a scammer</a> unable to provide the gold that he was selling. 
    The other two auctions apparently went through, for a total of $735.00. These 
    are the last sales GM Darwin makes on eBay; his total proceeds (not including 
    eBay fees) are $5,822.39.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 21, 1999 A letter from an 
    anonymous hotmail account is sent to all GMs, most major UO web sites, and 
    this author, mocking Dr. TwisTer for concentrating on GM Darwin's alleged 
    lapses against the user Vader as proof that he is fact Vader on the Baja shard 
    (Dr. TwisTer's UO identity is a closely guarded secret, since it is an open 
    secret that OSI would like nothing more than to ban his account). This despite 
    the fact that the word &quot;Vader&quot; appears nowhere on Dr. TwisTer's 
    site, as is pointed out immediately.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While I have no proof, I now, in 
    retrospect, believe that this letter in fact originated from a GM, if not 
    GM Darwin himself. The full letter is online <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/twistnshout.html">here</a>, 
    near the bottom of the page. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometime during this week, someone 
    discovers the pattern of GM Darwin's auctions and reports them to OSI. GM 
    Darwin claims that it was <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/jov/">Nighthawk</a>, 
    who was rewarded with a keep and 5 million gold. Nighthawk later denies recieving 
    any reward but does not comment on whether or not he was the one to discover 
    and report GM Darwin.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 24, 1999 GM Darwin is placed 
    on temporary leave of absence pending an investigation by Origin. He posts 
    the following letter to the Gate Traveller's Test Center message base:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.. I am no longer employed 
      with Origin Systems Inc. and thus this ends my time in UO, as they not only 
      blocked the two accounts they gave me but, my personal one as well. Is not 
      a problem as I could never play the game again anyway. </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hold no ill will toward 
      Origin Systems Inc. as my leaving was my fault. I wish you all well and, 
      I hope you goes on to be a bigger and better game. I will no longer be on 
      ICQ and all my email addy's have been changed. So this is my farewell to 
      all the Test Center players I met or even did not meet. I will not even 
      take the time to bore you with a list of all my friends I have made as the 
      list is long and distinguished. </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks again to all the players, 
      GM's and PD's that make this game what is it. Good luck and farewell all. 
      </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kevin Roseler </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No longer any boards friendly 
      flamer Tolky , Sir Gateway and GM Darwin </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">June 28, 1999 OSI informs GM Darwin 
    that he has been terminated, but that no legal charges will be filed. OSI 
    issues the following press release:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Thursday, June 24th, Origin 
      Systems (OSI) was alerted to the possible misconduct of an individual employed 
      within the GM Support Department. Upon investigation, OSI found reason to 
      believe that this employee was engaging in activities that breached the 
      trust that must exist between a company, its employees, and its customers. 
      The decision by OSI management in this case was immediate dismissal. All 
      actions that are taken by members of our support staff are logged and monitored, 
      and we investigate all reports of GM misbehavior that we receive. We are 
      grateful to players who bring these incidents to our attention, as these 
      reports are used to ensure that OSI representatives are providing the best 
      possible service at all times. If you believe that a GM or any OSI representative 
      is behaving in anything less than the highest standard of service, we ask 
      you to please email complaints@owo.com with the details of your issue. Only 
      the most senior representatives of our support staff read this mailbox, 
      and we assure you that your issue will be thoroughly investigated. We take 
      our responsibility to our customers very seriously, and we will not allow 
      anyone -- staff or otherwise -- to abuse our service or our customers. </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That same day, the now ex-GM Darwin 
    places a bid to BUY (not sell) <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=124048196">an 
    account</a> with a 7x GM character and a tower on Napa Valley. The auction 
    is still ongoing as of this writing. He is not the high bidder.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Darwin's 
    wife, Alysha, emails me, wanting to tell Darwin's side of the story, but offers 
    no details.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That night, <a href="http://members.home.com/drtwister/">Dr. 
    TwisTer breaks the story</a> of Darwin's eBay auctions. Word spreads rapidly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I contact Darwin and conduct a 
    brief <a href="evolution.html#darwin">interview</a>. Among other things, Darwin 
    claims not only that Dr. TwisTer is in fact Vader and that this is known to 
    OSI, but that he was also a counselor named Retsiwt (&quot;Twister&quot; backwards). 
    He is apologetic for his actions, but is defensive and quick to assign blame 
    for them to others, asserts that other GMs would and are doing the same thing, 
    and that given the chance, he would do it again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the following days several mainstream 
    gaming and internet news media outlets express interest in the story, including 
    Blue's News (the main Quake news site), evilavatar.com, Gamespot, Gamecenter, 
    and ZD-Net. Dr. TwisTer's web site is down during most of this time, in probably 
    the worst luck ever suffered by a UO-related web site. My site sees a 500% 
    increase in site traffic.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Darwin lies low during all this, 
    not commenting to anyone after our interview. His wife Alysha, however, writes 
    this website and is <a href="http://www.mpog.com/pvp/alysha.html">interviewed</a> 
    by <a href="http://www.mpog.com/pvp">Scott &quot;Samwise&quot; Kurtz</a>, 
    a satirist and online-gaming commentator. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most writers and posters conclude 
    that the affair is merely proof of corruption within the GM and support system 
    of UO that they have long had anecdotal and personal evidence of.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OSI has had, and continues to have, 
    no comment beyond their original press release.</font></p>
