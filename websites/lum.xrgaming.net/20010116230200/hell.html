    him beating up hapless players in his wake. Basically, it's the Everquest 

    method of PKing, and apparently rather popular amongst those special souls

    excerpts from <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/southpark.htm">the

    I'm going to go to<i><b> hell </b></i>for copyright violations, even though 

    he told us all to spread the word about this evil and satanic movie... but 

    this is just too important. I mean, your immortal soul is in peril, people. 

    You guys are all so cavalier with your fragile souls, doing things like sodomy 

    and drinking rum and playing evil computer games, but... well, read on. Although 

    if you continue to read this page, <b>you will go straight to hell immediately.

    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SOUTH PARK - BIGGER, LONGER 

      AND UNCUT. RATED R</font></b></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WARNING! This analysis is blunt. 

      *South Park* is another movie straight from the smoking pits of Hell. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*South Park* is an *incredibly 

      dangerous* movie for those who do not understand or are developing an understanding 

      of the Gospel ....... INCREDIBLY dangerous. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Satan is portrayed as the homosexual 

      lover of Saddam Hussein and is portrayed as a sensitive, loving and caring 

      being. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Angels were portrayed as females 

      - nude, very nude. God was called many vulgar and hateful names. Satan was 

      glorified. Jesus was equated with sexual anatomy. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Body parts dripping with blood 

      were ripped from a child by a surgeon who expressed shallow concern. The 

      dead child was then seen with an exploded chest. The dead child, after being 

      rejected from Heaven (by nude female angels) and cast into Hell, was then 

      presented as a ghost trying to influence the other kids. Male chorus line 

      dancers wore pink bikini briefs. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are but a very few of the 

      examples of ignominy in this celluloid developed in the fiery pits of Hell. 

      And the kids in the audience loved it, almost as much as the adults with 

      them. May God have mercy on us.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note that the cut of the movie 

      I saw did not include the sodomy between Satan and Hussein or I missed it 

      while annotating other ignominy. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Canadians are vilified.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People laughed at the obscene 

      jokes, gave obscene finger gestures to each other, and otherwise seemed 

      to enjoy this blasphemous, immoral, evil movie.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The movie takes literally Marxist 

      Professor Herbert Marcuse's statement that language is a weapon of the revolution, 

      and the goal of the revolution is to tear down any semblance of morality, 

      i.e., Christianity and the Bible. As Marx said, prostitutes are better than 

      wives (whom he ridicules), families are bad and religion is the opiate of 

      the people. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The future of our society looks 

      very dim after thinking what those children will do and how they will behave 

      after this powerful entertainment virus corrupts their hearts and minds.

    TALK ABOUT EQ, BAY-BEE</A></B></font></P>

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK, new topic. Sorry for all of 

    you who wrote me wanting to know more dirt about UO GMs, but hey - the state 

    their rep is in you can pretty much make up anything short of statuatory rape 

    and the rumor's flying that they're guilty of it. So fill in the blanks your 

    own bad self.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new, really, really high level 

    plane just opened up in EQ. The Plane of Fear ...and I bet <A href="http://www.battlevortex.com/">he's</A> 

    excited he has his own plane of existence now! And guess who was the first 

    to explore in that new land... that's right, the <A href="http://www.firesofheaven.org/">Fires 

    of Heaven</A> guild. <A href="http://www.firesofheaven.org/foh/bbs/messages/763.html">Here's 

    some pics</A> from their field trip.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is, of course, the same guild 

    that recently <A href="http://www.firesofheaven.org/foh/features/TheSlayingofLadyVox-Veeshan06-16-99.htm">killed 

    Lady Vox</A>, the most powerful monster in the game. Of course, it didn't 

    hurt that <A href="http://www.eqvault.com/archive/19990613.shtml#1837">they 

    had Aradune tanking for them</A>. You know, the designer of the game? But 

    that's OK, because as he said, he really wasn't all that powerful, in the 

    grand scheme of things. </FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rumor had it they had a GM intervene 

    for them in getting one of their members to level 50 first. Just so they could 

    playtest new things, you understand.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My own opinion - anyone who is 

    already level 50 in EQ seriously needs to go out and look at the pretty flowers 

    outside once in a while. </FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And moving right along from the 

    somewhat fishy to the truly fucking pathetic, <A href="http://www.bluesalt.com/skillbot.htm">we 

    have this</A>. "And they LAUGHED at me at the Institute...!"</FONT></P>

  <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/30/99 7:30 PM </i><b>EVOLUTION 

    IN ACTION</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>&quot;You're just loving this, 

    I bet. This is what you've dreamed of. All Eyez On Me, hey Lummy?&quot;</i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know, the plan was to phase 

    out all this UO bullshit. I mean, I don't even <b>play</b> Ultima Online any 

    more. I re-installed it on my hard drive the other day so I could try out 

    some UOAssist <a href="http://www.growealth.com/chartrack">character tracker 

    plugin</a>. Haven't logged in since. No real cause or crusade to it, just 

    enjoy EQ more at the moment. Most of my friends, and more importantly the 

    woman I live with, are in EQ right now, not UO. And these are, at the core, 

    basically social experiences.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why does this web site exist? Well, 

    a couple of reasons... I like to write, mostly, and this beats muttering to 

    myself as I walk down the street. On a more altruistic level, I saw the need 

    for a voice for those players in games like UO or EQ who weren't being listened 

    to by the mainstream &quot;don't-publish-anything-that-might-piss-OSI-off&quot; 

    news sites or the &quot;Look!-The-GM-banned-my-account!-It's-a-CONSPIRACY!&quot; 

    rants most of the bug sites have devolved to now that there are few actual 

    bugs. Later, I thought it would be cool to do a sort of quasi-underground 

    no-holds-barred community news reporting thingy. But mostly, because I like 

    to write. It's a selfish thing.</font></p>

  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I think you're on the 

    verge of doing a Big Thing badly...&quot;</font></i></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then the Darwin fiasco broke, and 

    all of a sudden I got to play reporter. I think the funniest thing about it 

    all was that more than one person thought the interview was a parody. Sorry, 

    guys, I'm not that good a writer, portrayals of human frailty like that usually 

    have to come naturally. It's been a different web site the past couple of 

    days. And I'm sure the guys who make those ad banners up top were happy about 

    it; click the little graph button at the bottom of the page and you can check 

    out the big ol' spike in hits the site got. Woo hoo. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, the point I missed 

    while I was trying to ram it into <b>your </b>head was that it was all about 

    people, and the mistakes they make. My mistakes, my biases and prejudices, 

    got to creep right in there along with those Matt Drudge-like Special Bulletin 

    Reports.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall, it's a simple story. Boy 

    finds way to twist his responsibilities for personal gain, boy gets caught, 

    boy gets fired, boy whines to Flavor-Of-The-Month-Website about how it was 

    all for someone else's benefit. Pretty cut and dried, really.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I guess in my imitation of an unbiased 

    reporter, I didn't emphasize clearly enough what I actually thought about 

    the whole thing. Someone who emailed me about it put it best -- </font></p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>You're so right about this 

      Lum, I totally understand how this will destroy UO. Who's going to trust 

      a GM now? So many jokes will be made of this like "What took the GM so long? 

      Oh, his auction on eBay was closing." GM's thought they had trouble getting 

      respect before? They will NEVER be respected now. The ones who are trusted 

      will now have shadows of doubt cast over them. </i></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>And it's all the work of one 

      man. To paraphrase Dennis Miller: You're a punk, Darwin. A bad guy. Go to 

      hell. </i></font></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know it probably <b>never</b> 

    seems like it, but I care about the UO-EQ community (and yes, it's really 

    one large amorphous entity, trust me on this one). A lot. 98% of my social 

    life is there, and the rest is either work or email. (Yeah, sad, isn't it. 

    Look at your own life before you start throwing any stones.) I do not want 

    to be the catalyst of its corruption, and yet I look over the past couple 

    of days and wonder... how did I help? What did I accomplish here?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mainstream sites -- UO Vault, 

    Stratics, etc.. -- ignored this whole thing completely, and that was probably 

    the correct response. Yeah, a GM got fired. Not the first time, not the last. 

    Twister posted his bit, and that no doubt surprised anyone. Twister probably 

    cares about the community, too, oddly enough. I don't think he actually thinks 

    about the consequences of what he posts, but the fact that he's kept after 

    this, day after day, for the past year or so, speaks volumes. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consequences. Good word, really. 

    What damned Darwin, more than the auctions, more than the Mickey Mouse salt 

    shakers, was the refusal to accept the consequences of his actions. &quot;But 

    it was for a friend&quot;, &quot;The other GMs do it too&quot;, &quot;It wasn't 

    hurting anyone, really&quot;. Rule one - there is no such thing as a victimless 

    crime. The more fake money that flows into the UO system, the less value those 

    who actually strive for wealth and worth in game recieve. Why do I keep screaming 

    for a shard wipe? Because of those dupers and cheaters who have keeps and 

    castles full of millions of reagants and suits of armor they never earned, 

    they'll never use. The system is corrupt; this is only the next step in the 

    list.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's not OSI's fault.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God damn, that was harder to write 

    than I thought. But it's a simple truth. No system of accountability, no supervision, 

    no training can counteract the ability of one determined person to defeat 

    the system, and that's what happened. When they found out about it, they fired 

    him. End of story. Trying to use this as a hobbyhorse to cavail about all 

    the wrongs, real or percieved, in the way OSI runs their damned game makes 

    a mockery of any valid point I may try to make.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for the excuse, and that's what 

    it was, that he was helping a friend made it all better... well, let me tell 

    you a story.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ten years ago, I was pretty poor. 

    As in, if I screwed up my accounting, I ate Ramen noodles for a month, and 

    if I screwed it up any further, I would be heating them in the street somewhere. 

    Fresh out of college, no real work experience, bouncing around dead end jobs, 

    still white-knuckled from a bounced speed habit (yeah, that's another great 

    story that hopefully will never get told here), just basically a stupid kid 

    trying to get ahead in the world.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had a friend, who worked in the 

    same place I did at the time, a large faceless department store. He was an 

    assistant manager there. I would bitch at him from time to time about how 

    I wasn't paid enough, couldn't pay my bills, phone was about to get cut off, 

    yadda yadda yadda.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One day all my bills started coming 

    back with notices that they were paid. I wasn't the one who paid them.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of them were big. Real big. 

    Hundreds of dollars big. I was 3 to 4 months behind on most of my bills, and 

    BANG they were all magically gone. I did some calls and found out out it was 

    my coworker who had paid them. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I called him and asked about it, 

    and he said he was sick of hearing me bitch.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was no way he could have 

    afforded to do that on what he made... it wasn't much more than I. And I told 

    him so.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Don't be stupid, Scott.&quot;</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I told him to shove his stolen 

    charity up his ass. He was quite surprised, and then offended. What, I was 

    too good for his money?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, yeah. I was.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, I wasn't too good to 

    actually pay the money back myself, or even tell my employer what happened. 

    There are limits to everyone's goodness, I guess.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I can tell you, from personal 

    experience, Darwin wasn't doing his friend any favors.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What does that have to do with 

    anything? Not a damned thing. Just an interesting story, that's all. About 

    consequences. Sometimes we have to bite the bullet and face up to what we 

    reap when we sow.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tomorrow there will be other rants, 

    other idiotic updates about nothing in particular and especially not about 

    GMs and eBay. Just remember to keep it in perspective, believe nothing of 

    what you read at face value, and that it's all fun and games until people 

    get involved. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take care, everyone.</font></p>
