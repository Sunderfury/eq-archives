Banstyle sends in this eminently reasonable proposal:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">On April 27th of this year, I logged into Felucia or however you spell it for the first time on Siege Perlious. I died within the first three minutes to a horde of undead that just happened to spawn inside the bank of Papua. I was PK'ed by a mummy. <br><br>Before this I had an Illustrious status. Now, of course, I don't. As I am writing this now, I am at work, and for the first time in about two years, I cannot for the life of me remember what my notoriety status is off the top of my head. That, my friends, is a breakthru.<br><br>But what happened? Nothing changed on Siege Perlious, right? Why should I now, of all times, lose interest in something like that? The other shards got hit with Trammel, thank heavens. They spared us. They spared us because they want to see if people flock here, to our great shard in Texas. "Leave them one shard," said the great voice of E.A.. "and we shall see what they do with it!" This much I know. I've heard things, yes. (oh, btw, completely off topic.. I'm deathly afriad to go into town now. It's not safe, what, with all those "undead attacks" and all. Then I got to thinking.. this is what they wanted, right? They wanted people out of towns and such? Make the world a guardzone, and they can wander around everywhere.. that sort of thing, right? Why not just grossly increase the undead spawn in all towns. Less work, and it does the same thing, imho, but I digress.)<br><br>Anyway, I've heard alot of people bitching and moaning lately. Bitching and moaning is quite common to UO, I know. There is an easy solution to the current popular bitch and moan however. If you do not like what you are seeing here in Ultima Online right now, and if you are completely against this idiotic change you've been seeing, then instead of bitching and moaning.. join Siege! We don't have a Trammel! We never will!<br><br>So, since we all know the people at Origin do not respond well to bitching and moaning, I suggest the following: Operation: ClogUpSPsBackup! Everyone who doesn't like the change, come. I invite you. Personally, I enjoy Siege because there is less players to bother the shit out of me, (and, you know, the whole dying thing. I like to, you know, be able to die once in a while) but that's okay. You look like a nice bunch of folk. If we all join Siege we can show Origin what we think of the moronic change! Yaa!<br><br>Quick recap: If you feel like bitching and moaning, delete/sell ALL your characters, and join Siege. If not, enjoy the "non-dying-ness" of Trammel. I don't really want you to come over anyway. I don't like you.<br><br>In this scenerio, everyone is happy. Thats all I can say. k thx.<br><br>- Banstyle</font><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem957030866,37323,"></a>

For those of us on the Sonoma shard, it's been about a week of living with the divided lands.  While waiting to place our towers, let's sit back and look over what we've learned from this social experiment.<br><br><b>If players won't go to Everquest, Everquest will come to the players</b>.  Do you like camping?  If so, the "happy fun lands" might just be for you.  Numerous spawn sites have become home for some players.  The bandit camp, for example, is manned 24/7 by players, each jumping in glee and attacking any red name they see.  Why leave untill you have more gold then your warrior can carry?  Clothes make great bandages, after all.  Don't think you can chase off the bastards either.  Just bring more people to killsteal targets until the other group grows tired of the chase.  Oh, and those people talking to each other in the wilderness?  It won't last long.  Might as well make a macro saying "he's my kill" since that's the extent of conversation nowadays.  Is this a temporary aberation, or a permenant change in social structure?  We'll have to see.  For those who wanting to play EQ, but hate those 3-d graphics, you might want UO.  We just don't have half naked elf chicks or anything.<br><br><b>Sell moonstones early.</b>  Thought your stocks took a tumble this month on Wall Street?  Wait untill the moonstone market crashes on your shard.  Day one, moonstones were selling for 1-5 thousand.  One week later, the price drops to 150 gold.  If the current market holds, by the year 2001 players should be able to recieve a placed castle in exchange for taking a moonstone off someone elses hands.  I think.  I slept through my economic classes when I went to college.<br><br><b>Free gold for everyone!</b>  Risk vs. Reward, folks.  For those of you who don't play UO, dungeons are a great place to get lots of gold, however the night will normally end with the gold being stolen from you and someone named "PiMpDaddY" emoting "*assrape*" over your corpse.  OSI has solved the later with the barneyland.  Now you can make free money with no risk involved.  Case in point?  I took a half devloped bank thief with no combat skills.  With casual play (less than an hour every other day) I'm now a master warrior with 40k in the bank.  Great for casual players, but say "bye-bye" to the economy.  Newbies begging at banks should soon recieve a few hundred thousand gold everytime they pester somebody at the Brit bank.  The biggest impact will be on the real world value of virtual gold in UO.  Instead of being worth more than the Italian lira, expect future press releases to brag about the relative value to Etheopian currency instead.<br><br><b>I'm crawlin' with bugs!</b> Given the complexity of creating a mirror of the old lands with new play rules (<i>Did I say mirror?  Ooops.  As we all know, this is not a mirror!</i>) some bugs were to b expected.  As long as you don't need the healing skill, or objects staying in your backpack accross server lines, this patch wasn't too bad.  (<a href="http://magnus.uong.com/topten85.htm">It's all relative, you know</a>)<br><br>Despite all this, all one has to do is look at the empty cities in "Nuclear Winter Land" to see that, for the most part, the player base is pretty happy with it.  Of course, they might just be in the new lands for the free loot or the housing space, but the players have flocked there.  It's only us grumpy malcontents who seem to have an issue here.  For those you waiting for the patch to hit, that's what you have to look forward to.  For those of you who stayed away from UO because of all the terrible horror stories you heard about "PiMpDaddY"....well, c'mon back.  This patch is for you.<br><br>Us surly reds, and other grumpy bastards, will be sitting in the Brittania retirement homes telling the damn kids who visit us "how good it was in the old days".<br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003392.html">Share your grumpy stories here</a><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem956967188,5037,"></a>

Let's get one thing said first: overall, the new Kunark expansion for EQ is fantastic. Lots of things for high level groups to do, and the Iksar newbie zones are bar none the most well crafted newbie zones in the game. <br><br>...unfortunately, not everyone can get to Kunark, because, as Verant found out, <b>shipping CDs is hard!</b> So hard, in fact, that they finally gave up. If you haven't ordered your upgrade yet, you're going to have to pay full price at the store. Oh well, an extra $20 is a small price to pay for being able to bind in a room with gates to almost every city, right?<br><br>...well, after today, you can't. Verant took away the ability for EVERYONE to bind in that zone (including casters) after much complaints from the now-absolutely-not-in-wolf-form Druids and the look-goddamit-we-are-unbalanced-fix-us-NOW Wizards.

We just got word from some folks who know far more than we do about these things that the "<a href="http://www.shugashack.com/pic.x/misc/042800_uo2_1.jpg">screenshot</a>" sCary posted is actually a 3DSMAX rendering (someone even recognized the canned particle effect on the torch).<br><br>Which begs the question, why is the UO2 team so hesitant to actually release a screenshot of the engine in action?

It has been written optimized for Direct3D, and is designed to deal with problems that are unique to a massively multiplayer game, such as allowing for a high level of character customization, and dealing with dozens and dozens of avatars on scene at one time. Yes, the engine is running pretty good right now. Not good enough to ship yet, but it's in striking distance.<br></font>".<br><br>According to the <a href="http://uo2.xrgaming.net/library/roundtable">UO2 chat</a> last night, the UO2 team is going to be showing off, "behind closed doors" (aka to a limited, controlled audience - although not <b>that</b> limited since they scheduled me in) an "E3 demo". They also mentioned a "UO2 movie" to be included with the much awaited PC Gamer. In other words, a demo reel.<br><br>As in not a demonstration of a working engine. <br><br>As in, does UO2 actually have a working engine?

Heather, mistress of the <a href="http://cmg.uo.tradespot.net/">Cove Merchant's Guild</a> on Great Lakes, is not a happy camper. It seems a Seer on Great Lakes was actually, you know, running events on a regular basis and keeping people happy instead of hanging out in IRC and carping about the players, so of course she was immediately "asked to move to another shard." The players who worked with this Seer were understandably upset, when someone from a previously unseen arm of the Great People's Volunteer Force - a "moderator of the Official UO Message Boards" no less! - visited the upset and angry GL players to tell them, and I quote verbatim, <b>it's just a game.

We are WINNING THE WAR!"), and the few people who are actually trying to, you know, do things that would keep the players interested, and oh, I don't know, advance the storyline of the game, weren't enmeshed in their own game of justifying their existence to the nearest empire-building representative of UO: The Hellish Bureacracy that manages quite nicely to stamp out any possible iota of creativity that someone might dare to exhibit... oh, who the hell knows, we might actually have "Volunteers" who would know better then to tell players to "get over it" after Origin's Infrastructure Juggernaut rolls over them yet again.<br><br>But what do I know, I just play the game.

Just about everyone I know who plays Ultima Online uses ICQ (because nobody I know who plays Ultima Online uses any of the in-game communication services).

Well, today is the day that all remaining shards are patched with the UO: Rennaisance code. Now everyone can enjoy learning / commands ("Group? I need to group? I need to be around other people? In a multiplayer game?"), exploring a wonderous new and uncharted land which initial reports claim bears an uncanny resemblance to the wonderous old and fully charted lands, and, most importantly, the ability to forever kiss goodbye the thought of ever being killed by another player. Initial reports are that most of the grief players are still in Teenage Wasteland, although on Great Lakes the past few days it's looked an awful lot like the fall of Saigon, with red gates to Happyland popping up onscreen 4 and 5 at a time everywhere you look.<br><br>Hopefully, the bug that caused things in your backpack to just sort of disappear when you crossed a server line is gone and we can all get back to waiting for the ability to place stockpiled tower deeds. A lot of folks are complaining that this patch is going in with a bare minimum of testing and with a whole lot of bugs still in it. Well, while UO:R has obviously been rushed to production the past couple of weeks, the fact remains that it's in stores now, and has been for the past week or so, and, y'know, at some point we have to bite the bullet and enter Happyland. Or not. Undoubtably we'll see more bugs come up, more unexpected downtime and server warps to fix them, and eventually things will calm down. Or we'll all die to rabid mongbat AI.

Now you at home can match the monkey with their proper banana. Woo woo! (Sorry, wrong Community Coordinator.)<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Knight - Knight is the Executive Producer of Ultima Online 2.  Knight is responsible for providing an unlimited supply of soda and pizza to the team, and making sure that everyone gets paid on time.  Oh yeah, and all of that top-level management stuff like plans, strategies, forecasts, positioning, and coordination.<br><br>Blackthorn - Blackthorn is the Producer of UO2. Blackthorn's goal is complete domination of the world by technology.  When not planning this domination from his lonely citadel, he finds time to oversee the day-to-day workings of the project, supervising the programming, design, and art leads. Beware the claw!<br><br>Ubiq - Ubiq is the Lead Designer of UO2.  Ubiq's job description entails giving his lead programmer an aneurysm at least once a day, keeping Mobius and Windfeather from killing each other, explaining to the fans how and why things will work, and trying to imagine all of the ways that the less scrupulous elements of the UO2 player base will attempt to break the game. In his rare moments of spare time, Ubiq has been known to sleep and eat. Ubiq has a pathological fondness for flaming kittens, which no one fully understands.<br><br>Gaffer - Gaffer is the Tech Lead for UO2.  He is responsible for overseeing the consumption of soda and pizza, and making sure that milestone and ship celebrations happen in a timely fashion.  Additionally, Gaffer manages what looks like the programming team, but is actually a crack ninja fighting force of extraordinary magnitude.<br><br>Cynthe - Cynthe is the UO2 Community Coordinator.  She oversees cool stuff like interviews, IRC chats, message board postings, website updates, and the prequel fiction release schedule, as well as making sure that no gerbils go homeless within the Origin building.<br><br>Tungsten -  Tungsten fancies himself the Art Director for UO2. A normal day consists of pointing any one of the 13 fabulously talented UO2 Artists in the right direction, administrating Leads meetings, reviewing gobs of amazing art, plunging fearlessly into the schedule to find our way to ship and finally closing the day with a quiet session of Unreal.<br><br>Hoyboy - AKA Puddin' - AKA Heliogabalus.  As Creative Director he massages the visual coolness factor to a high degree of polish.  Amongst other things he keeps the artists fat and happy.  How does he do this?  With plenty of love, olive oil and, what else?  Puddin'.<br><br>Windfeather - Also called a 'Lamer Roleplayer' by the bloodthirsty components of the design team, Windfeather's job is to design social and community systems for UO2, a task he frequently likens to designing systems for herding cats.  Windfeather's goal is to survive until beta without getting PK'd by the programmers for creating too much extra work.<br><br>Mobius - Mobius is a game systems designer, number cruncher, and UO2 Live lead designer.  Mobius eagerly awaits being the scapegoat for any and all potential game balance problems during beta.  He is also a proud, card-carrying member of the bloodthirsty designers that call Windfeather a "L4m3R RPer".<br><br>Ghosthacker - As Lead World Builder, GhostHacker tirelessly pounds out the beat beneath the decks of the UO2 world building barge. Occasionally, late at night you can hear his drums from the depths of Origin with his foul cry, "Generate terrain faster, ye scurvy polygonal monkeys..." <br><br>Gunner10 - Gunner10 leads the game programming (scripting) side of the team, which means working on stuff like AI, Combat, Inventory and other game mechanics.  He is also the unofficial standard bearer for formal software engineering practices, which everybody agrees is A REAL GOOD THING (TM). More or less  :-)<br><br>Ahriman - Ahriman is the Minister of Fiction for Ultima Online 2.  He is responsible for all things fictional, including crafting clever stories to justify more soda and pizza.  Ahriman's goal is to weave the various threads of Ultima Lore into a seamless tapestry, or to marry Tyra Banks, whichever he can pull off first.</font><br><br>The first rule of a totalitarian dictatorship - make the overlords seem human and down to earth!

All 32 children were able to purchase games with a "M" rating.<br><br><a href="http://www.ag.state.il.us/pressrelease/041800.htm">You can read his press release here</a><br><br>Will the state of Illinois make it a crime to sell violent video games to minors?  According to the press release "He also has instructed his staff to explore alternative enforcement strategies if the problem consists".  Without passing a law first?  Arresting retailers for not following a voluntary rating system?  This story, I'm sure, will continue to develop.<br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000268.html">Should retailers in Illinois be worried?</a><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem956765347,39901,"></a>

Just when I think the Dev Team might actually have somewhat of a clue on how communities in Ultima Online work... they pull a stunt like this.<br><br>Snuck into the latest "In Testing For Next Update", three down, is this little gem:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Rares contained by another container, or found in player houses, will no longer be locked down</font><br><br>OK. Is someone at Origin actively thinking of ways to screw over players? I mean, is this on someone's task list? "Wednesday - make players scream in agony and fear Thursday - buy pepperoni subs for team members Friday - beat GMs" <br><br>Jesus, as if this RenPatch From Hell hasn't been screwed up enough on those shards unlucky enough to be designated Unofficial Beta Testers, Origin, which is well aware that there is a market in rare items, has not only gone to the trouble of keeping those rares from being useable in Trammel, but now apparently wants to take <b>the ones the players already have away!</b><br><br>Take Myschyf, for example. Her house on GL has a whip locked down on a bed. It's cute, in a sort of scary knife-to-the-gonads sort of way. That whip is going away. Why? Was Myschyf bad? Did she somehow penalize other players by decorating her house? Is making her house seem a little more personalized seen as a grief tactic now? I mean, it's not like her house is locked or anything. Anyone can, if they are so moved, walk in and be frightened by Myschyf's whip. At least, until the next patch and it instadecays from not being locked down.<br><br>I don't know if this <i>idea</i> was born from malice, stupidity, or cluelessness, or some hellspawned combination of all of the above, but this is just insane. It's wrong. Someone at Origin needs to sit down and realize that when players use thier precious sprites to decorate their spaces that UO players spend the majority of thier time in, it is not somehow "bad", or inherently "worse" then when they use them to decorate NPC houses that almost no one ever enters.<br><br>Jesus.

Just when you thought the Kooooooonark saga couldn't get any worse, um, well, it did. The last patch delivered updated manuals with a Word97 macro virus embedded within.

We at Verant proactively work to eliminate the possibility that things such as this happen, however some safeguards were unintentionally bypassed as party of the Kunark opening.

Much.<br><br>Moving from reading about Kooonark to actually, you know, <i>playing</i> Kooonark, aside from low frame rates when 30 or 40 noobie lizards are close by, it actually is pretty impressive.

Sure, we have nice cuddly dev types <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/uo2/devboard/messages/114.html">posting up a storm</a>, showing up in chats, and otherwise waving the <a href="http://www.uo2.com/">gatorskin-black flag</a>. We have a website that has <a href="http://www.uo2.com/faq.html">a few hints</a> that, you know, someone in Austin is thinking of making this game called UO2.<br><br>But where's the proof? To be blunt, where's the <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/sorcery.html">screenshots</a>? Where's the <a href="http://sb.drtwister.com/sb-interviews.shtml">ongoing discussion of game mechanics</a>? I mean, even <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/rds.html">Rune Conquest</a> has screenshots up, sort of. Right now Pete Baumann Jr. has more proof of a viable game up and running than Starr Long. Something ain't right.<br><br>Now, part of this may be a sort of desire to maintain competitive advantage. After all, Ultima Online is the only MRPG that doesn't let you know how many folks are on a server because, y'know, that's <i>important competitive information</i> that would tell people, I dunno, how many folks were on a server. (Maybe they're embarassed people will see 50 people on Siege Perilous and 3000 on Atlantic?). Origin has in general been much more aggressive about not letting anyone know what's going on inside the gates. After all, considering the past ten years of their history, they have a lot of reason to be. Every single game that has been released by Origin in recent memory - Ultima 8, Ultima Online, Wing Commander Prophecy, and Ultima 9 - was released too early, was released in a bug-filled state that required numerous patches before being even remotely playable (or in WC Prophecy's case, simply shoved out the door without key elements like multiplayer capability).<br><br>Simply put, there is doubt from a lot of us, myself included, that Origin can actually release a game. You know, a box on a shelf that you buy and it works and stuff. And there's a lot of hard questions about UO2 that need to be asked, that aren't even close to being answered. <br><br>Let's take UO2's engine, for example. According to Origin, it's an inhouse 3D engine that supposedly is optimized for smooth Internet play. Guess what. The same guys who say this say that Ultima 9 has a smooth 3D engine and right now is in such a state of karmic perfection that there is no longer a need for <a href="http://boards.owo.com/">tech support forums</a>. For some reason my suspicion about Origin's ability to make a 3D engine that goes at more than two frames a second is a little low. Hell, for all we know they may not <b>have</b> an engine yet. We certainly haven't seen one. We have lots of folks inside Origin saying "Look! It's in 3D! It looks cool!". <br><br>They said the same thing about Ultima 9. Frankly, after Ultima 9, I want notarized letters from the dev team's parents that yes, they know that Direct3D exists now. That yes, QA testing is really neat and occasionally finds bugs and stuff. Basic things like that.<br><br>That's just the framework. What about, you know, the game? Well, you may know, but I don't. Ubiq in particular has been very active out on the boards, but a careful reader will note that he doesn't actually tell us anything about the game itself. He gets lots of feedback on what we'd <b>like</b>, but for a game that is supposedly six to nine months from release, it's a little late to canvass the Net for a feature request list.<br><br>You know this wouldn't be Lum the Mad without a whacko conspiracy theory, and here's mine. In Starr Long's <a href="http://www.uo2.com/comments-dev_7.html">producer letter of April 7</a>, he says the following:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">We are also excited because we&#8217;re working with PC Gamer on a big sneak preview story that will coincide with E3. Starting at E3, we will be stepping up the amount of information we are releasing, including screenshots and information about game systems. We can&#8217;t wait to share this with you!</font><br><br>That PC Gamer story has been rumored for quite some time now. It is the Holy Grail of UO2 watchers... supposedly the PCG staff was given "unlimited access" to the development process, and presumably actually know that the game exists.<br><br>PC Gamer is owned by Imagine Publishing. Imagine's web arm, IGN, owns Vault Network. Vault Network likes to nail down <a href="http://www.mythicentertainment.com/cam1pr.html">exclusive contracts with game publishers</a>.<br><br>That wouldn't have anything to do with the total lack of information given out by the UO2 team, of course, or the willingness to give a print magazine in a competitive industry a big exclusive. Juuuuuust a coincidence. *Lum whistles and walks slowly away*<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000262.html">So what's coming out first, UO2 or Rune Conquest?</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem956586427,66204,"></a>

Ultima Online certainly isn't the first game to have their support staff use their powers for the dark side and it won't be the last.  Unless, of course, game companies actually start learning lessons from each other's mistakes and I've yet to see that happen in any significant way.  <br><br>I've seen my share of abuse of power by GMs in Ultima Online.  I've seen my share of clueless counselors.  We all have.  To their credit its been a while since I've seen anything I could take exception to.  The last incident by a support staff member that I had a problem with was a counselor telling a friend of mine that his house was illegally placed and would be deleted.  This happened about 4 days after Calandryll posted on COB (and, I think, FYI as well) that counselors and GMs couldn't tell you if a house was illegal or what action would be taken so don't ask.  I guess this counselor didn't read the website.  That was about what.. 6 months ago?  4?  The guy must have borrowed a clue from someone in the counselor IRC channel because after about a half hour of arguing with him, he finally said the house was classic and wouldn't be deleted.  Hey I knew that!  Go figure. <br><br>Things are definitely better today than they were two or three years ago, pre-Tyrant.  Before Tyrant came to OSI, GMs were so abusive of their powers one couldn't keep track of it all.  From giving their friends houses, to moving their friends houses, to changing the locks on their friends houses, to PKing with their friends using their GM accounts, to giving their friends gold and rares.. if it could be done by a GM it has been done by a GM.  All you GM and Counselor types that right now want to tear my head off for saying this I'm sorry.  I know conditions are not great for you and I know you guys work hard.  But you know, hell EVERYBODY knows, how bad it was before Tyrant came.  Therein lies the problem.  We all have long memories.  The bad memories, unfortunately, seem to last longer than the good ones.  <br><br>My memory is even longer than that.  My entire guild left NWN (Neverwinter Nights -- the original on AOL) publicly and as a protest against the abuses by the support staff in that game.  Fortunately for us the LOK (<a href="http://www.gamestorm.com">Legends of Kesmai</a>) beta had started by then and we had all been invited to participate so it was a real good time for us to stage a protest and leave.  The abuse by support staff in that game was unbelieveable.  On a par with the early days of UO.  As a matter of fact, it was so similar that UO often reminded me of NWN when the game first went gold.  <br><br>LOK <b>never</b> had a problem with abusive support staff.  Never!  I'm still amazed.  I played that game for almost 3 years and I never, not even once, not even a little, saw any staff member use their powers for anything but good.  Every letter I wrote was responded to within a week.  Even if <b>I</b> was angry and abusive I got a nice reply with a serious response to my concerns.  It might not have been the response I wanted to hear, but the fact that I got a response each and every time impressed me to no end.  Have a problem with another player?  In that game you could hit a button and the last 100 lines of text would be sent along with your complaint to support staff who would review the logs and get back to you.  And they did.  You NEVER saw support staff teleporting people around without appearing first and telling the person exactly where they were teleporting them.  Even when they caught you abusing a bug (and they caught many people abusing bugs) they were polite and courteous.  Unsurprisingly, Tyrant comes from Kesmai Studios and abuse by GMs was stomped on quickly when he went to OSI.<br><br>Tyrant knows something that every game company should know and heed.  A game company cannot afford to have its support staff abusing its powers or appearing as if they are.  A game company cannot afford to have support staff less knowledgeable about the game and the policies than the players are.  These are some of the basic tenets of customer service and online game companies are, first and foremost, providing a service.  Yes, I know you think its about a game but once you've purchased the game what is then provided is a service that you pay ten bucks a month for.  Support staff (GMs and counselors in UO, GMs in EQ, etc.) are the front line representatives for this 'service-oriented company.'  As such they must be polite, explain their actions, and be sensitive to their customer's feelings. <br><br>It isn't ok to be transported to jail on a whim because a GM needs to talk to you quietly.  Being teleported to jail is traumatic.  It makes you think you've done something wrong.  If you haven't, you wouldn't and shouldn't be in jail, right?  (In LOK, that most perfect of games, I heard that if a staff member wanted to talk to you privately you were teleported to 'ghod land' which was some place with really cool graphics and new and interesting stuff that wasn't in the game.  I never went there myself so I can't verify that but it sounds a whole lot better than jail.)  It isn't ok to be teleported away from a scene without being told why.  That just angers people and makes them want to come back and rant at the GM who teleported them, thereby defeating the purpose of being teleported in the first place.  It isn't ok to see a fellow player who just PK'd you made invulnerable by a GM.  Not in any case but especially not without explanation.<br><br>With respect to the situation reported yesterday, the GM may have had a perfectly good reason for doing what he did.  One having nothing to do with abusing his powers.  This still <i>would have been inappropriate behavior</i>.  Even if the people who took the screenshots were grief players trying to PK randomly the GM's behavior would have been inappropriate.  He never said why he was there.  He never asked them to stop.  He never told them they would be teleported away.  He never said why he was making the player invulnerable.  With all due respect to Tyrant, you simply cannot expect players to blindly follow the directions of a GM to "move along" -- ESPECIALLY when they are angry and trying to exact revenge.  Remember that player justice stuff you guys are so fond of?  <br><br>But it goes deeper than one GM screwing up one time or many GMs screwing up many times.  I think this points to training and compensation -- both of which seem to be lacking.  An afterthought at best.  I am but an egg and have never been a GM however I hear they don't get paid much (ten bucks an hour is the figure I've heard bandied about), don't receive much training, and the working conditions suck.  Counselors don't get paid at all.  Oh they get a free account -- whoopee.  Its a pissy job too.  Personally I don't understand why anyone would want to do it.  I'd go postal the first time some loser paged me to tell me his real-life wife was shacking up with some dirtbag in the game and could I please cancel the dirtbag's account.  I freely admit I don't have the patience to do this job.   But those that do have the patience to do this job and do it well should be well-trained and well-rewarded.  They are not.  For the most part game companies have ignored this section of their service, treating it as a necessary evil.  Volunteers are told to work a strict shift, so many hours a week, be constantly monitored, are the lowest echelon of the corporate hierarchy, get few percs, a rushed and hurried training by someone who really doesn't want to train them, get no pay other than a free account, and are not trusted both by the players and by paid employees of the game company.  GMs are a bit better paid and, from what I am told, actually have to report to the game company location for work, but the above still applies.  For this we expect top-notch service?  Are we out of our minds?  <br><br>It gets worse.  Once a GM has made a decision the communication from the game company becomes minimal at best.  I hate to keep harping on how great Kesmai was in this area but dangitall they just seemed to do everything right and I don't understand why other game companies seem to be unable to follow their lead.  In that game, once you had made a complaint, you received a letter from the support staff with the text that you sent to them and a nice note saying they were taking action but couldn't tell you exactly what (which meant that the offending party had been slapped down in some way) or that they were sorry but they didn't see a reason to take action.  I've probably written UO Concerns about a dozen times.  I have yet to ever see a letter back from whoever it is that is supposed to answer that mail.  The one time I had a serious problem with a GM it took me three letters to get an answer and I had to turn to another source as UO Concerns would not answer my letters.  I've had friends, good friends, real life friends who also play UO, write UO Concerns and never receive an answer back.  (I have no idea how EQ and AC handle their letters, perhaps some of you will be good enough to tell me in the comments section of this article.)  This simply isn't acceptable.  If someone writes with a complaint that complaint MUST be addressed, regardless of how stupid or worthless it seems.  If you doubt this I urge you to read the comments section of this article.  I'm sure this is going to strike a nerve with many players.<br><br>Even looking at the comments for "UO GM ACCUSED OF INTERFERING IN PLAYER VS PLAYER COMBAT" you'll see that this entire subject is a sore one for most people.  This strikes a nerve.  When people are treated as though their complaints are worthless and invalid -- so much so that they are <i>not even given the courtesy of a reply to their email</i>  -- they tend to get cynical and angry.  This has happened.  One need only look to the history of support in these games to see why so many people, even those who might normally be supportive of the game company, are so ready to believe the worst of a GM who may, actually, not be in the wrong.  This situation and the response it received should be a wake-up call for OSI and for every other online gaming company out there.  I know that it will take money and resources, something that EA, that bastion of all that is evil and wrong with the game publishing world, will resist.  All publishing companies will probably resist it.  Yet, it is important and needs to be done.  <br><br>To do any less than to commit fully to a well-trained and adept support staff does a huge disservice to any online game.  Lets hope that this situation serves to remind the game companies that they provide, first and foremost, a service and that their customers are their number one priority.<br><br><i>*The above quote is by Bertrand Russell.

I guess this GM really <b>could</b> help him with that.<br><br>I'm interested in the other side of the story - this is, of course, only one side. There are at least two others - the guild being attacked/rendered temporarily invulnerable, and the GM who surely must have had some reason besides the obvious motivation of helping a buddy win a straight-up PK vs. Anti fight.<br><br>We hope.<br><br><i>Addenda</i>: Shortly after this story was posted, Gordon "Tyrant" Walton had this to say on the subject:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">We are already looking into this, but a good rule of thumb is when the GM says "move along", you should do so. The GM's and Counselors are trying to help players, and we do want them to be able to accomplish this, though we strongly prefer they don't interfere with gameplay.<br><br>It will be investigated and appropriate action taken, as are all claims of GM or volunteer impropriety.</font><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000258.html">Leave your comments here.</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem956325897,96949,"></a>

Moving on from server code undeployed to expansion CDs unshipped, let's check on today's status of the continuing saga, "Shipping CDs Is Really Hard!". <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/imthelaw.wav">John "Rocco" Smedley</a>, Verant's President For Life, <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033878.html">informed everyone</a> on the Whineplay board that godddamit, he did <b>not</b> need no steenkin laws to tell <b>HIM</b> what to do:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Here's my thoughts:<br><br>We don't need "the law" to tell us the difference between right and wrong. We have screwed up and will do right by our customers. If you don't have it by Monday, we'll be giving a free month of EverQuest (as long as it was ordered in a reasonable amount of time (i.e. someone in Taiwan that ordered it today shouldn't expect to get it by Monday).<br><br>Believe me it's painful to watch this happen. We're not jumping for joy here watching people get pissed about this. We planned extensively (despite appearences) and to watch some unexpected glitches mess us up is quite depressing.<br><br>All we can do is work through the problems, fix them and make it up to our customers.</font><br><br>So, if you don't currently have an expansion CD, you'll play for free until you get one, unless you live in some far off corner of the world like Zululand or North Dakota, in which case you can just pay more shipping. So there. <br><br>Also, remember the "<a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/rokwoes.html">outragerous conspiracy theory</a>" I alluded to yesterday? Um, well, Gordon "Abashed" Wrinn kinda <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/034077.html">pumped it full of a bit more air</a>. Again from Whineplay ("JC-Smith" being <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/">EQ'Lizer's</a> webmaster and the author of the aformentioned article):<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Upon further investigation and contact with JC-Smith on the subject, I was able to obtain the name of the GM that made the comments. It does appear now that the comments were in-fact made and I'd like to extend my apology to JC-Smith and EQLizer for my abrupt comments on the matter. It is apparent that JC-Smith's first email inquiries on the matter were overlooked among the many others we've received in regards to shipping. I've provided JC-Smith with my email address to increase our ability to respond to issues such as this in the future before they grow to these proportions. <br><br>I would like to stress that the GM involved is new to our company and is still becoming familiar with the way we operate our business. He evidently misunderstood the situation and his comments on it were mistaken. The problems associated with shipping the product late last week definitely were not planned, nor do we consider them acceptable as attested to by our CEO John Smedley in his several posts on the subject. <br><br>As mentioned by John, we continue to apologize for the problems associated with shipping the expansion upgrade pack, and are committed correcting the situation in the eyes of our customers.</font><br><br>An uninformed Everquest GM spreading misinformation about the game and its company? Surely you jest.<br><br>Tune in tomorrow, when I'm sure we'll have even more things to shake your head.<br><br><i>Last Minute Addenda</i>: Verant just announced that they would be refunding the shipping charges of everyone who doesn't recieve the expansion CD in time (which they estimate to be 20% of orders). Here's the announcement:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Due to the unfortunate problems we have had with our order processing system, it doesn't look like every person that ordered Kunark will receive it in a timely fashion. We sincerely apologize for this unanticipated problem. We expect that roughly 80% of the people who ordered will be receiving their orders by Monday.<br><br>Because of the problems we have had we will be refunding anyone who ordered Ruins of Kunark on or before Wednesday April 19th and does not receive their orders by Monday April 24th for their shipping costs, as well as crediting their accounts for one month of gameplay. This applies to International orders as well. We'll be taking care of these refunds via email at an email address that we will set up on Monday, and it will be necessary for anyone that wants to take advantage of this refund to email the address that we will be giving with some specific information.</font><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000251.html">Um, I ordered my expansion CD from Tau Ceti via Express Mail...</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem956323660,58893,"></a>

Well, Sonoma is at least still running, after using the piping hot new UO:R code since Wednesday. Some crippling bugs, a few of which you readers mailed to me (and I promptly mailed to OSI - um, I don't do well at debugging UO server code, guys). Although some of them were really pretty bad, such as the Look! I Got More Dex! bug and the Everyone Can Be Glorious Lord In Five Minutes bug, it looks like those are getting stamped out. I guess you have to deploy a major patch to a large shard and, you know, <b>force</b> people to play on it to catch the really bad bugs. Another bug (or was it a feature?) I noticed while logging in my [young] character into Haven was that all the newb quests didn't work, or at least they wouldn't work for my newb self. Oh well.<br><br>There was <a href="http://uohoc.stratics.com/">a UOR:HOC chat</a> last night, and tOAD let slip this tidbit:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Felucca is the world ruled by Minax, destroyed, beaten, a wasteland.

Fiction in gaming.  What a concept.  One that apparently no one knows how to do well, that everyone wants to do, and one that everyone (read gamers) wants.  How do you drive a consistent story line in an MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) with two-hundred-thousand players?  By having two hundred volunteer seers/elders/whathaveyou that play ubercharacters and pk the paying customers in the name of evil?  This, so far, has been EQ's answer to fiction in gaming and, to a large extent, UO's as well.  Who among us hasn't heard the horror stories of going to an 'event' in EQ or UO only to see the dead bodies of player characters spread 3 screens out and some seer-played invulnerable evil character doing an MMORPG maniacal laugh and promising to take over the world.<br><br>This, of course, brings me to another question.  Is good vs. evil all we can do?  Is this the best our imaginations can bring forth?  Have we really explored the extent of our story-telling capabilities?  Have the numbers proved to be so large and unruly that all we can do is throw up our hands exasperatedly, swallow half a dozen Advil and send out more ubercharacters?  I know there's only 6 or 7 plots in the world, that Shakespeare wrote extensively on all of them and that all we can do now is rehash the same old same old but you know... authors do manage to write new and interesting books with new and interesting stories.  Movies are still made that people enjoy seeing.  Why does online gaming, which should be the marriage of fiction, cinematography and interaction, which seems like the perfect venue for a blending of all these things, which everyone jumped into thinking that NOW they could finally be the hero or the villian or the damsel in distress or whatever archetype floated their particular boat, fall so short of the mark?  Can we really only come up with killing each other or any odd assortment of monsters as an answer?  Surely there must be more.<br><br>So what would it take to introduce a good fiction to an MMORPG?  Or an MMOAG (adventure game)?  What is the difference between the two anyway and does the second one really exist?  Well.. when was the last time you played a game and felt you were going on an adventure, that you were going to explore new places and see new things and maybe even accomplish something more than killing monsters and getting phat lewt.  I'm not talking about an in-game marriage, or something that your guild did, but something that was actually provided by the game mechanics and was part of the initial and intended game design.   Your silence is deafening.<br><br>Games, online games, and damn few single-player games as a matter of fact, provide some sort of fiction you can play with, work through, or be a part of.  To my knowledge its NEVER been done in an online game... ANY online game.  But everyone wants it and everyone thinks there's a market for it and everyone would love to design it.  And, as far as the publishers are concerned, it should be designed for a pittance and net millions.  And they think WE are weird?  Bah!<br><br>So where is this great full-of-plot-and-story-line-where-we-can-all-totally-immerse-ourself-in-the-fiction-game?  Why hasn't it been done yet?  Is it even worth doing?  Why should a developer even try to make a content-heavy adventure game when the online (and offline) gaming community has proven that it will settle for a 3d first person shooter or a game whose only goal is the 'kill monsters, get stuff, go up levels, kill bigger monsters, get better stuff, go up more levels, kill even bigger monsters... etc etc' type or some sort of monty haul where you kill, buy and sell things and store your ever-growing piles of phat lewt until you finally grow bored and sell your account for thousands on ebay.  <br><br>For that matter, why can't it be done effectively within UO and EQ with game staff?  Is it because these games were never designed to carry a story in the first place? Every time I look at a message board these days I hear players screaming about fiction in the game -- or, more truthfully, the lack thereof.  <br><br>According to some, MMORPGs are, by their very non-linear nature, not made to carry a story line.  However paper D&D games are non-linear too -- and they do story very well.  Even large LARPs (Live Action Role Play) do story very well, albiet oftentimes the ending that the GameMaster envisioned and the ending that actually happens are two different things -- making for some very tired GMs on the last day of the LARP as they stayed up all night rewriting the story.  And LARPS and paper games, even very large LARPs and paper games, don't have two hundred thousand people in them.  But you know what -- neither does any one event ever held in an online game to date.  The most I've seen is about a hundred.  I've done LARPS -- fun LARPS, with great stories -- with a hundred people.  <br><br>I think sometimes we tend to get stymied by the knowledge that there are so many of us in a particular game.  When writing a story we say "well I can't do that because too many people will show up for me to do that" rather than just going with the flow and dealing with the situation as it arises.   To go back to the example of the large LARP, the GMs there often don't know exactly how many will show, whether they will stay to the end, or even if they will turn the story in an unexpected direction.  But they deal, adjust, adapt.  No one does that like LARP GMs do.  Is it really so wrong to expect that MMORPG GMs and Seers do the same?  Can't this sort of interaction be incorporated into a content-heavy adventure game to make that rich rewarding roleplaying and fiction experience everyone seems to be looking for?  I think it can.  I also think its worth it.  I think ANYTHING that moves us out of the old time worn 'lets go shoot and kill things' rut that we've stuck ourselves in is worth it.  <br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000255.html">From the toys that we've discarded and the tears we never cried</b></a><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem956281556,24400,"></a>

Heard enough kvetching about Origin's UO expansion? (It actually works on Sonoma, and I even got screenshots of a "young" Lum the Mad in Haven for an upcoming review. W00t.) Time to move on to Verant's. Of course, this is assuming you actually <B>got</B> your Kunark CD. I did, some others did, many others didn't. According to <a href="http://www.zomax.com/">Zomax</a>, the fulfillment house Verant chose, <font color="#77FF77">"demand for this game has outstripped all expectations."</font> As a still Kunark-free Sensei of <a href="http://thedojo.extropian.org/">the Dojo</a> noted, <font color="#77FF77">"could someone please explain to me how on God's green and round Earth you underestimate the demand for an Expansion to a game that has an exact number of accounts and that only lets you order 1 copy per account?"</font>. <br><br>Of course, as Zomax puts it on their <a href="http://www.zomax.com/">home page</a>, "<font color="#77FF77">the day is past when you could measure world-class companies by the strength of their operations.</font>" Now you measure them by the vehemence of their public relations teams, I suppose. Verant's is particularly vehement this week. In response to a particularly whacko <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/rokwoes.html">conspiracy theory</a> on EQ'Lizer that accuses Verant of purposefully staggering Kunark shipments to try to lighten the server load in the Kunark zones come launch, Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn, Verant's Goddam Internet Relations Manager, <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033510.html">stated</a>, in part,<br><br><font color="#77FF77">This is completely false and I'll go so far as to say that this didn't happen. It is so far removed from the truth that I'm not willing to accept that anyone employed by Verant could have made a statement to this effect.</font> <br><br>So THERE. In case you don't speak PR, here's Lum's translation:<br><br><font color="#7777FF">This is really a lie. This is so much of a lie it's actually something we didn't do.

It's been a long, hard, weird day.  It get's stranger.  Sometimes a story can be too good to die.  For those who read about the rise and fall of <a href="http://www.reddragonsoftware.com/">Rune Conquest</a> (and if you haven't then go <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/rds.html">here</a>, it's a whopper of a story) we have a special treat for you.  Peter A. Baumann, the 15 year old "president" of Red Dragon Software, wrote me the following.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">Your request for an interview would be an appropriate one if you were in fact interested in the truth about Red Dragon Software, Inc. and our first online game, Rune Conquest.  However, I do not believe you are interested in the truth, because I am aware of the fact that you have already posted your article (I believe it is entitled THE TALE OF A DRAGON) on the internet.</font> <i>Editors Note: This e-mail is a response to the request for an interview I sent far before the story was published</i><br><br><font color="#00CC00">In that article you list one falsehood after another.  I would estimate that over 90% of the "facts" you list are falsehoods.<br><br>It makes me wonder if you are affiliated with the two or three gamers who have already attempted to discredit R.D.S. and R.C.  Since these two or three gamers are afraid to identify themselves, and be responsible for their libel and slander, we do not feel obligated to respond to their false accusations.  Since you have chosen to repeat their falsehoods on your Website, without first requesting your interview, I do not feel you deserve an interview.</font>  <i>Editors Note: Once again, he is replying to the request I sent for an interview before I wrote the story.</i><br><br><font color="#00CC00">Please allow me to enlighten you with one bit of information.  Many of the so-called facts you list in your article were originally posted by people who had no affiliation with R.D.S.  For example, who ever said we received over 500 pre-orders at $50 each?  It was someone at the public forum, probably one of those individuals who has tried to discredit us from the start.<br><br>You mention a "Chuck" in your article, who supposedly pre-ordered the game, and requested a refund, and did not receive it.  Since January, we have offered full refunds to everyone who pre-ordered, THREE DIFFERENT TIMES, and only three people have taken us up on that offer.  If we were a scam, wouldn't you expect most or all to request a refund?  Contact "Chuck" and tell him to email me here, with his real name, and if our records show he did pre-order, we'll issue his refund.  He'll be only the fourth to make such a request.</font>  <i>Editors Note: I have indeed forwarded this message on to Chuck</i><br><br><font color="#00CC00">The truth of the matter, Bob, is that those who did pre-order refuse to let you, Blueknight, VOR, or any of the other skeptics tell them what to do.<br><br>Our Board of Directors has decided to simply Take Care of Business, and develop Rune Conquest, and not to respond to anonymous skeptics who may have ulterior motives for their supposed skepticism.  You should know that all of these attempts to discredit R.D.S. started after we refused to hire a supposed game programmer who had submitted a false resume (Talk about a scam!).  We believe he is behind most of the trouble, acting as more than one gamer at the public forums.  He as much as threatened to harm us if we did not hire him.<br><br>One other point of interest, Bob.  Our original programming and Website manager, Chris Anderson, perpetrated a "scam" on us, by posting pictures he had taken from other games, but told us he had created for R.C.  We learned about this fraud from one of the public forums, from gamers who helped bring Chris Anderson's fraud to light.  What did we do?  We immediately fired him! He retaliated by doing irreparable harm to our Websites.  We're still trying to undo the damage.  Does that sound like a company that's "scamming" the public?<br><br>Bob, I don't expect you to post a copy of your request for an interview, and a copy of this reply at your Website, or at the Enilsson Forum, even though that would be the honest, and honorable, thing to do.  Then again, you might prove me wrong.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Peter A. Baumann</font><br><br>The following is my response:<br><br>Mr. Baumann,<br><br>Well Peter (and let me say how refreshing it is that you feel that we are on a first name basis) let's address a few of these points, shall we?<br><br>You are quite correct that the story has already been posted.  I regret that you choose not to respond to my request for an interview, and that I was forced to rely upon your previously posted words on the internet.  It was indeed an opportunity lost.  For example, some questions that I would love to see answered are;<br><br>If there is a game that was almost ready for beta, why haven't there been any original screen shots posted?  Why are you unable to describe the interface or the basic mechanics of the game?<br><br>If you were going to beta at the start of the year, where are the servers?  One would think for an internet based game, owning ones servers would be a pre-requisite.  Not only do we not see any game servers, but we don't even see a mail server.  Even without the alleged theft by Chris Anderson, how were you planing on conducting a beta?<br><br>It's been months since people sent sent in 50 dollars for your product.  Where is it?<br><br>You see, Peter, it would have made for a far better story had you answered those questions.  Fortunately, this site is always interested in getting the facts.  It's never too late for you to answer.  You also state in your letter that "over 90% of the "facts" you list are falsehoods."  Please clear things up then.  Which facts do you dispute?  Since a good portion of the article was based upon quotes from Red Dragon Software, I'm rather curious as to what you believe false.  Here's a wonderful opportunity for you to state your case.<br><br>You then go on to say that "it makes me wonder if you are affiliated with the two or three gamers who have already attempted to discredit R.D.S. and R.C.".  Are you suggesting that there is an organized cabal of conspirators out to get you?  Are you suggesting that the web site "The Rantings of Lum the Mad" has only been pretending to report on other games, so that a year later we could ambush you and RDS?  As one of my readers pointed out "[it] sounds like Scientology and other con jobs. Blame the people who left for any gaping holes in your story, discredit the skeptics as being unreasonable without giving solid proof of your own claims, and give emotional pleas for an open mind (hopefully followed by an open wallet)."  Quite so.  You can also accuse anyone who writes about your product as being affiliated with your mysterious foes.<br><br>You state that the number of 500 people who paid for the beta test was incorrect.  If that's so, then how many have paid you?  How much money have you made off your product?  You seem quick to dispute facts, without providing any of your own to counter them.<br><br>You say that you are trying to repair the damage and you ask if it sounds like a company that's trying to scam the public.  If that is so, then why not give your side of the story, rather than personal attacks on the integrity of those who ask questions?<br><br>The ball is in your court, Peter.  Both my readers and I are very interested in what you have to say.<br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000250.html">Curses! The cabal has been discovered!

(3 posts combined into one! - Lum)<br><br>As most of you know, I play Everquest.<br><br>As most of you also know, I suck at it. I'm an antisocial gimp who gets pissy and quits almost every group he joins. Thus I pretty much never get beyond 20th level on any character.<br><br>Here's a note from someone, then, who can go where I can't, and brings back the story of why you shouldn't bother. I'll leave him anonymous for what should soon be obvious reasons. Suffice to say I know this person and value his opinions.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">For those of you who have not had the 'pleasure' of getting to the LevelQuest Uber levels and fighting your way through the uncamped planes of hate, fear, and air, let me give you a taste of what you are missing.<br><br>On the Rathe server a group of some of the more active guilds got together and formed a clique called 'Foundation Rathe' (sorry if this makes you reminisce of high school, by the time you finish reading this article you will realize it is in fact, not at all like high-school, but rather much more like kindergarten). Foundation Rathe is commonly referred to as 'FR'.<br><br>This alliance of guilds organizes who gets to be in the planes and who does not get to be in the planes, who gets to go on planes raids and who does not get to go on a planes raid. Well what happens if you are not one of the clique members? Say, you have friends in the clique but you choose to be in a guild outside of their alliance. Well, <a href="http://pub8.ezboard.com/ffoundationrathegeneraldiscussions.showMessage?topicID=162.topic">this is what happens</a>.<br><br>You get invited to show up, you fight, you die, but you don't count. You see this is normal for most planes groups. One group gets large enough that they can dictate to the remainder of the server who does and does not get 'access' to not only loot but to entire areas of the game. You no longer play EverCamp by Verant's rules but you subject yourself to the politics of other groups and other people. All is well if you fall within their clique but may the gods of Norrath save you should you not move within such circles.<br><br>Granted EverQuest is a game about grouping and friends, but when you REQUIRE 40+ people to make an assault on a planes only select groups can get involved. Should you not be able to field that many people you are forced to find other groups to help you. When you do, you are read the riot act: "play by our rules, do what we tell you to, and if we like you, you can quit your guild and join ours and maybe earn the right to loot something up here".<br><br>When you are level 10 and 20 and even 40 you run across people who choose to be difficult to work with. They antagonize other groups by being petty and selfish, killing a monster you were fighting or making things difficult (pulling a train on top of you etc etc). This is not so common at the higher levels as it is at the lower levels, or at least you would think. The catch here is that you can always go to another place. There has to be well over 20 places for a level 40 players to go to where they can get experience with a friend or two. All is well in barneyland until you enter the realm of dragon raids and the planes. Then you have 40+ players competing for a handful of loot and the gloves come off. <br><br>Things get nasty as people all begin to show their darker side. With so few drops, the pressure to play favorites and to play the buddy buddy game increases, all the while the opportunity for generosity dramatically decreases. People fight and bicker over the chance at a rare drop with little or no concern of the well being of others. Of course this becomes accepted, it becomes common in fact, to the point that we all rationalize it as 'we are just human' and it is now a human flaw that we all face and not really our fault.<br><br>While we are arguing over the scraps Verant drops off their table, we turn our backs on those whom have helped us get here. We forget about 'the outsiders' or the opportunity to make new friends. Making new friends now means we have to risk our small chance at a piece of the pie. Let me ask you, who's fault is it? Is it Verants fault for designing the game this way? Is it our fault? Are we are by nature humanly flawed? Or is it the fault of few greedy players monopolizing within our game?<br><br>One thing is for certain, it is no fun to be forced to move your circle of friends just so that you can get some virtual 'loot' or an uber item. It is no fun to be unable to ever access large high level areas of the game unless you sacrifice what is left of your humanity or play the political game. I think the fault here rests on everyone's shoulders. I think it is high time people took responsibility for their actions in the online world before every virtual world turns into a social cesspool and we start to see a much darker side of the human genepool, one that we are embarrassed to admit exists.</font><br><br>Here's a note I got from someone in Foundation Rathe, responding to the previous story.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I don't know how you are or what you are but I am not quiet sure if you are aware of how things are done on our server.  All guilds have entered into an agreement with regards to "reserving" planes.  We prefer this method to the non-sensical perma camping of Fear and other planes that exist on other servers.  This practice has been used and with fairly positive results for quite sometime. Secondly we are a minor player in the grand scheme of things on the Rathe Server there are several much larger and much more powerful alliances KIC, MFH/CIW, and KEG.  To imply that we, a relatively small alliance, dictates who gets in to the planes shows your complete ignorance on the subject and your lack of knowledge about anything with regards to our alliance.<br><br>The fact of the matter is this, the game itself requires the cooperation and organization of tens of people to do anything of any consequence.  I would love to hear your proposal for how people could do things like killing cazic thule or nagafen and be completely unaffiliated.  Love to see it please humor me.  The fact of the matter remains that everquest it self is flawed the game requires mass cooperation and organization on an epic level.  We have chosen to be affiliated simply to accomplish these tasks and to enjoy one another company.  We do and always have allowed for independent participation and will continue to do so. However, we are not and going to group up, work with, or be partied with any individual. Yes in some ways we are excluding people from our runs. We choose who comes with us and so does every other guild on the server, if you want to complain, complain to Verant for making it necessary to have 40+ people to do particular tasks.<br><br><br>Regards,<br><br>Insidius Bloodleech<br>Black Talons<br>Ambassador of Foundation Rathe</font><br><br>Also, it's important to note, as the previous correspondent pointed out, Rathe is so old it has MUTIPLE uberguilds. Apparently they coexist somewhat peacefully. If you want to know who's where on the Rathe, you need a <a href="http://www.eqraid.org/cgi-bin/calendar.pl">scorecard</a>.<br><br>If your guild wants to go say howdy to Innoruuk, looks like you get to wait till, oh, next Thursday. Cazic Thule? Sorry, no openings till next month.<br><br>So what do you think? Is this a rational response to server overcrowding or Qeynos Hills 90120? I'm still not sure what I think about this. It's an interesting sociological phenomenon, at any rate.<br><br>By the way folks, please don't spam their board. We have our own to pollute. Thank you, and drive safely.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000247.html">I think this is worthy of comment, don't you?</a></b><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem956160436,62397,"></a>

In Februrary of this year, the world stood still as every major online presence was bombarded with a string of DOS attacks that cost an estimated 8 million dollars to some of the platinum names in EMarketing. Sites like <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.com">EBay</a>, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, and yes even <a href="http://www.uo.com">UO</a> were brought to their online knees by a tsunami of flooded packets. The governments of three world powers (and Canada) conducted a global investigation, and early speculations pointed to Middle East terrorist factions sponsored possibly by Khadaffi, Bin Laden, or any number of Palestinian threat groups.<br><br>At a press conference scheduled sometime this morning, officials from the FBI and the Canadian uhmm...Mounties I guess... will offer up the first official charges in these attacks. What renown terrorist did they catch? What nefarious death-cult activist was responsible? The truth may surprise you, and eventually will dissapoint you.<br><br>His real name is not released, but his online name is "Mafia Boy". Officials have requested that the case documents be sealed and the identity of the charged not be released, because <font color="FF77FF">HE IS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD.</font> All we know is he lives in Canada and uses the name Mafia Boy online.<br><br>Now, I'm not making any accusations here, but am I the only person to find <a href="http://my.uo.com/cgi-bin/my_chars.pl?38baf497dd4a6e7625f21ff8e767a1e179e77aeb14fb880788e32daf5aeb0da0">this particular Wakoku character</a> interesting? The name Mafia Boy might not be unique, but it's just one of those things you have to judge for yourself.<br><br>Due to his age, it is possible that his legal guardians (I hesitate to call them parents at this point) will be responsible for his charges, but I am not familiar with Canadian law. Do they still tie people to logs and send them down river? I need to check up on that. Anyway, I have to side against the parents in this one. Growing up, I didn't toss a stone without my father knowing where I found it, where I threw it, and how far it went. He was a "hands on" parent and when it came time for him to put his hands on a belt and tan my ass, he make short work of it. I didn't throw too many stones around when I was a kid. Like it or not, the system worked. The boy next door, who was my age, had parents who sent him to his room for throwing rocks and such. I always hated him because he would get us both involved in some plot or scheme and while I had a spanking on the horizon, he simply had to go to his room to watch TV or read comic books. Today, I'm working a steady job and I'm on the verge of a promising career as an author (shocking, I know). Meanwhile, the kid next door who never got his punishment is sitting in a penitentiary in Baltimore, whittling squirrels out of soap bars and making all sorts of special friends.<br><br>The point is, we can't take children for granted. We have to watch them like mother hens. We have to perch on their shoulders and monitor their every move, and be swift to discipline them when they earn it. Spare the rod, spoil the internet, right? Hopefully Mafia Boy is in for some major league spankings. Hopefully his parents will hire a professional spanker to make sure the job gets done right. Otherwise, I hope he enjoys carving little forest animals out of soap.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000246.html">I offer you a discussion thread you cannot refuse, eh?</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem956128692,32395,"></a>

Attempts to contact Mitsuo Fuchida were unanswered at press time.<br><br>We knew it would be powerful, but until now we could only imagine. It seems that the Japanese Ministry of Defense will have a hand in the distribution of Sony's Playstation2 game console equipment to the United States and Europe. This constitutes the largest deployment of Japanese military hardware since December 7, 1941, when three squadrons pounded the American Pacific fleet into the depths of <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/timeline/pearl.htm">Pearl Harbor</a>.<br><br>I'm sure they mean us no harm this time around. The concerns actually seem rather far fetched. It turns out that certain components of the Playstation2's video processor and memory decryption are not all that dissimilar to the components found inside missile guidance systems. As a result, Sony must apply for a special military exportation permit from Japan, which most experts feel is simply a matter of formality.<br><br>Hype and drama aside, this is not expected to delay the global "launch" of the playstation2, unless of course you live in <a href="http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/multi/terrorism/wtc.html">Iran</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/5260/">Libya</a>, or <a href="http://www.npa.go.jp/keibi2/it5.htm">North Korea</a>.

You have Trammel, otherwise known as "Happyland", which will have space for housing and an end to PKing, thievery, looting, hunger and want, and Felucca, otherwise known as "Kewlville", which is the same old boring land you know and love now, save with lots of gravestones, blasted trees, and dead carcasses. But it's OK. You can turn them off and Kewlville will look the same as it ever was. Just type "Desolation=off" in your config file. I wish lawn care were as easy in my own world.<br><br>Something bothers me, though. Checked out <a href="http://town.uo.com/bnn/">BNN</a> lately? <br><br>We've had, on a daily basis, a cross-shard storyline advanced via quirkily humorous <a href="http://town.uo.com/bnn/article_49.html">Real Audio clips</a> and, more importantly, an <a href="http://cob.xrgaming.net/guide/quests/view.php?file=mainplot.txt">invasion of Britannia</a>, what everyone surmised to be the leadin to UO:R, that climaxed in the <a href="http://www.uo.com/spot_41.html">seizure of</a> and retaking of Trinsic. Really good stuff. Sure, some problems in execution, but this is the sort of thing that UO really shines at.<br><br>So, of course, Origin stopped. <br><br>On March 26th, the <a href="http://town.uo.com/audio/Daily_40.ram">last</a> BNN audio report had everyone groaning with the <a href="http://town.uo.com/bnn/article_57.html">news</a> that Lord British was really not captured by mongbat hordes after all, and everyone was safe, and Bobby Ewing walked out of the shower reminding Pam that the last season was all just a really bad dream. Last week there was a brief posting explaining the sudden appearance of the Faction stone placeholders that <a href="http://update.uo.com/dev-comments.html">we're not going to be needing for a while</a>.<br><br>And that's it. No explanation of why the world is about to go kablooey and suddenly be split in two, half of which looks like the cover of a bad heavy metal record. Minax is apparently content to polish her leather dominatrix suits somewhere quietly. The monster hordes attacking the cities of the realm have receded, forgotten.<br><br>Admittedly this whole story has not been the pinnacle of high fantasy in general, but I would hope I am not the only one who feels as though he has to wipe the monkey feces off of his clothes. It's as if Origin said "well, this has been real fun, but, um, we're awful busy coding UO:R now so, um, we'll get back to you on this story thing."<br><br>Which would be understandable, if, say, Sunsword, Toad or Runesabre were the ones responsible for maintaining the backstory. But we have this <a href="http://cob.xrgaming.net/guide/view.php?file=volunteer.txt">whole, confusing architecture</a> of Seers and Troubadors and IGMs and lions and tigers and bears, and you know, the whole damn JOB that they are supposed to be involved in is the backstory of UO, and you know, one wonders just what the hell they are <b>doing</b> right now. Waiting for the UOR patch like everyone else? Peekaying on their other account? Discussing the latest N'Sync CD in IRC? Your guess is as good as mine.<br><br>Couple of explanations here. None of them good. All of them, hopefully, really wrong. Let's run them down in reverse order of suckness.<br><br><b>The guys responsible for UO's plot all got laid off.</b> This is one of the more believable conspiracy theories, especially since the BNN updates fell down and went boom right before the weekend they were announced. If true, this tells us that Origin believes UO's plot is expendable. Everyone surprised, raise your hands. Thank you.<br><br><b>Origin is waiting to see what Richard Garriott is going to do.</b> It's hard to construct a backstory when your main character decided to go work somewhere else. Then again, they could have just said that Lord British fell victim to the mongbats. I would have believed it. It would have a sort of karmic quality to it. Maybe the mongbats were pissed about being left out of Ultima 9. <br><br><b>Someone forgot.</b> Hey, it happens. Maybe there's a GM over in Austin whose job title includes "Plot Maintenance." Maybe he's been busy? <br><br><b>The plot line was never actually finished.</b> Possibly in line with the "everyone doing it got laid off" theory, there could have been this incredibly detailed timeline of events that just stopped on 3/28. Someone lost the last page of the printout? I don't know. <br><br><b>Origin doesn't care.</b> There's a LOT going on right now. Actually, you know, explaining what is going on could just be really low on the priority list. <br><br><b>Origin doesn't know.</b> Plot? We had a plot? Shit, someone could have told us. Damn. That looked cool. We need to get out more. Damn it, the test center went out again...<br><br>Look, I am well aware that the "RP" in "MMORPG" has always been a cruel joke. I am equally well aware that many who play UO are actively <b>opposed</b> to the very idea of an overall backstory. It gets in the way of the story of D'lentha D'erridex, Ruler of the Elven Court of Minas Tirith, who emotes *rubs his chin thoughtfully* whenever faced with a problem. It's something fag rollplayers do. Whatever. It's just not important to a large part of the UO userbase.<br><br>It's important to me. Although I feel more and more like an idiot for thinking so with each passing day. Maybe UO really is just a <a href="http://home1.swipnet.se/~w-10840/">gangsta's paradise</a> after all.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000240.html">On my knees in the night, saying prayers in the streetlight</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem955977060,66976,"></a>

We had all gotten comfortable with it though and it did shock us that several of us were banned.  After the surprise, once everyones emotions had calmed down we had many discussions about what had transpired. Here are the facts.<br><br>When we opened the site we did it as a revolt against OSI.  After a month of that with no reaction from OSI we took another look at how things were and decided that we would also email OSI the bugs in the hopes that they would get fixed quicker or fixed period.  Never once did we get an email back from OSI about the emails containing information on bugs and exploits until the emails that we were banned.  When Runesabre states that we never sent any in he is incorrect.  We never sent any directly to him but we had sent in around 40 emails to them.  <br><br>I actually agree with OSI's actions of banning us for posting the bugs and exploits.  As a business owner myself I would have done the same thing.  My volunteers do not all agree with me on this but that's ok.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.<br><br>As a team the volunteers and I have set new goals and are working towards them.  OSI will not agree with all of them but what can they do?  Ban us again?  We do consider ourselves journalists and we report the news good or bad.

We've seen protests for people <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/jov/">banned for saying the word "jap"</a>. We've seen protests for <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/uoevil/">people banned for crashed OSI's IRC channels</a>. We've seen protests for pretty much everything up to and including bringing back precasting. So, I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the strange and terrible saga of "<a href="http://www.graphicsmasters.com/uo/">Markee Dragon's Updaters</a>" and their current protest to, as far as I can tell, allow folks to run bug sites.<br><br>Basically, one of the sites in the <a href="http://www.markeedragon.com/">Markee Dragon Empire</a> was a site called "<a href="http://www.markeedragon.com/uohospital/">UO Hospital</a>", where, um, bugs were posted because, you know, OSI never fixes bugs and stuff, and if we told them they would, you know, never fix them and stuff so the only way to get them fixed is to expose them to public scrutiny over and over again until they quit doing whatever it is they do over there in Austin (I've heard vague rumors of some new expansion or something), get off their asses, and fix the bugs so that they can post new ones and start the cycle anew.<br><br>We've <a href="http://uo.drtwister.com/">seen this logic before</a>, of course, and many folks do happen to believe that in the past, Origin has only fixed bugs when they were publicly exposed. This line of reasoning is on a par with answering the question, "How long have you stopped beating your wife?". Obviously, there have been many bugs in UO which were fixed without the knowledge of or dissemination by the "Bug DeWDz". And, if someone really, honestly, truly wanted to get the dev team's attention, it's <a href="mailto:calandryll@uo.com">not</a> <a href="mailto:sunsword@uo.com">that</a> <a href="mailto:toad@uo.com">freaking</a> <a href="mailto:runesabre@uo.com">difficult</a>.<br><br>So anyway, apparently a "friend" of one of UOH's reporters turned in the accounts of those who were bug posters, and three accounts connected to UOH were banned (including the presumably clueless girlfriend of one of the posters), along with an updater for the still sort of online <a href="http://www.uoshack.com/">UO Shack</a>, just for good measure.<br><br>Now, probably the most unusual of all this so far is Origin actually figured out the in-game accounts of bug site updaters. That Tyrant's Friendly Strawberry Death Squads immediately swung into action and "terminated with moderate prejudice" anyone loosely connected should by this point surprise no one. Except, naturally, the folks who were banned. As Tiberius, the most vocal, states:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">OSI has banned me for posting bugs on a public forum, with no warning or reprieve. Many of you many remember Dr. Twister, as I worked with him torwards the end of his era of UO. He tought me one thing, that was honesty, being truthful, and never hold anything back...No matter the results! I tried to follow his example with my work on MasterSage and here on UOHospital, I tried my best, and I hope it was enough for all of you. <br><br>I will FREELY admit to UNKNOWNLY breaking the TOS, note the unknowingly. Never did I know you could get banned for this as I would have never done it if I knew I could get banned, nor would I expect any of you to. </font><br><br>So someone who was an updater for Dr. TwisTer (and I bet you were just sitting there wondering where they went) had no clue, no <b>idea</b>, that running a bug site would somehow be considered by Origin as somehow bad. I guess among the requirements for updating for TwisTer's site was not included actually <i>reading</i> TwisTer's site. <br><br>At any event, William "I'm not telling you my stupid nickname"  Leverett emailed Tiberius basically calmly pointing out where in Origin's TOS it stated that posting bugs on public sites was in fact grounds for account termination. Tiberius's response? Well, if you follow the UO community with any regularity you can probably figure it out - he was mad as hell and by god, he isn't taking it any more!<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Now before this whole thing gets ugly I will ask you one time to reinstate my accounts. The last thing I want is your offices getting flooded with petitions and the shards getting hit with protests. I do not wish for others players to be hurt by these events, but it will happen as the players are very upset by your actions. <br><br>Also I want you to know what I have been working on incase things are not restored, this is not a threat on my part, just a fact. I have started to write a letter that will be sent to all MAJOR PC GAME MAGAZINES, including PC Gamer and many others. Also I have started to send email and gather numbers for all 4 MAJOR local news stations in my area. All of the stations carry a "Consumer Protection" program that is aired every few days, and I bet they would just love to have a story about EA/OSI with the Dev of UO2 coming and the release of UO:R. Plus I bet they would LOVE to hear about how your company released a program that was unfinished and advertised it as something new.<br><br>I am a very resourceful man, that works a site that pulls over 10,000 hits a day. My words and ideas spread, so do not think you have defeated me as I have just only begun. I asked nicely to have my accounts reinstated and I did not know I was violating the TOS. I asked for my girls account back as she had nothing to do with it. I even offered to apologize and work with you on bug fixes... Plus several lawyers have contacted me stating I do have a legal basis to sue OSI/EA, this I do not want to do because I think we can resolve this issue without going that far.</font><br><br>No word on if he plans to <a href="http://greatbob.uoboard.net/strip13/strip13.html">appeal to the Federation Court</a>. Also, at some point during all this the number of banned accounts escalated from 3 to 500 (no word on if they were all actually bug site updaters). Another banned updater popped up on a <a href="http://www.uotwo.com/ubb/Forum25/HTML/000114.html">message board thread</a> and had this to say:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I for one have already spoken to an attorney regarding all of this. I took in all my saved journals, my original game cd and emails from OSI regarding other problems I ahve had in the past with flagrant violations of the TOS concering others behaviors on the game. She has done a prelimanary investigation of this matter and assures me that there is legal recourse. Since the TOS is actually a two way legal and binding document, OSI can not ban a few without banning all that ever violates the TOS, which means evryone that has ever played the game. Yes I mean everyone! At some time every player has violated the TOS! Maybe not knowingly, but they have. Look at all the tiny little infractions that violate it. Have you ever mentioned a real persons name during game play? If so you violated TOS. Have you ever said you had a vendor selling "whatever"? If so you violated TOS. Have you ever said a bad word? If so you violated TOS. Get the drift? All of us at one time or another have violated TOS. What about the jerks that called me a f'ing whore and when reported the only response I recieved was, "I see where they did nothing wrong"! Clearly that was a violation of the TOS! Thats the 2nd line of it in fact. Now who violated what here? Me for reporting the sexaully offensive remarks, the persons stating them or OSI. According to my lawyer it was OSI that has violated the TOS in that incident. Shall I go further? You all get the idea.<br><br>The time has come that I no longer wish just my account back, as I have lost the heart for it any way. Now is the time I fight hard for the right of freedom, which is guaranteed to all in the US. I am demanding not only the reactivation of my account, but a monetary compensation as well. And Im not talking chump change here. If a;; of those banned for this joined in together, guess what? We, the banees would literally own OSI and all its subsideraries. I'm am not some young kid who does not know of law. On the contrary. law has been a part of my life for over 20 years.<br><br>All I can say at this point is beware OSI ,youre mine now!</font><br><br>So, if I read this correctly, we should all be banned, by lawyers, for saying that we sell "whatever" on vendors, because freedom is guaranteed to everyone in the United States, which includes owning OSI. Which is his, now.<br><br>So if you see your shard overrun with hundreds of protesters demanding justice, freedom, and shares in EA, you now know why. Let's close with a quote from Runesabre, Lead Bug Obfuscator for UO, in a letter he sent to this site:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">You know what's amusing with all these "I am helping UO by posting bugs" websites...<br><br>You would think with such obvious "concern" for the well-being of UO, those same people would go the more direct and easy route of trying to get things fixed by sending such exploits to the Lead Programmer of UO. Seems to be some advantages to this approach:<br><br>1) Don't have to learn HTML, find website space and spend time updating a website. A simple text email to my address seems pretty easy compared to running a website.<br><br>2) Would actually get their mission accomplished quicker without hurting a bunch of innocent players along the way.<br><br>3) Don't have to martyr themselves on public display and can escape the constant public limelight/ridicule for posting such things.<br><br>Yet, one longstanding *fact*: I have yet to ever receive a detailed exploit from any person as described by my first statement. <br><br>Maybe I am missing something.</font><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000238.html">We're all missing things.

Just when you thought it was safe to return to your favorite website you get bushwhacked from behind.  Yes kids the hits keep right on coming.  <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com">Battle Vortex</a> has once more been updated with yet another of Chairman Adrick's Stupendous Waffling Angst-Filled Moments. <br><br>In an attempt to tell the developers, the readers of his site, and indeed, anyone at all who will listen, read, or not kill him before he gets it all out, Adrick presented us with a list of his thoughts on how to 'fix' UO.  Here is a direct quote:<br><br><font color="#FF77FF">"12] Dont put in a pvp- land"</font><br><br>Today, Adrick explains to us how he isn't a grief pker, never was a grief pker, never will be a grief pker, and what is happening in UO to keep grief PKers at bay.  Here is a direct quote:<br><br><font color="#FF77FF">"The addition of pvp- lands will help out alot - the removal of gate and recall and the global tracking of true the pkers of innocents will go a long way towards making stat loss a moot point."</font><br><br>Well I have to admit folks.  I'm stumped.  Does he want them or not?  Will they fix things or not?  Who knows?  Not Adrick, that's for sure.  It isn't a misrepresentation.  How the hell can you misrepresent someone who says one thing one day and the totally opposite thing the next?  We couldn't misrepresent this man if our lives depended on it.  <br><br>I'll tell you one thing.  Getting rid of gate and recall isn't the answer.  By the time any sort of revenge party is organized the pks will be long gone -- with or without recall or gate.  And tracking pks doesn't help much when you track them back to their house and the loot is stored and they have logged.  Or simply don't feel like coming out of their house.

We can't wait for the next episode of "Raistlin and Rand Al'Thor" here at LumCorp. We sit around idly hiting reload on our browsers, wondering, can it get any more silly? Can we see even more self-referential updates aimed at an audience of, well, LumCorp?<br><br><a href="http://www.battlevortex.net/"><B>Sure</b> we can!</a> Luckily Raistlin updated this time. This makes us happy and warm, because Rand Al'Thor actually has a sense of humor. Not Raistlin, though, nuh uh. "Too passionate", as he would say. And what is he passionate about? Say it with me brothers, sisters, and lumbots -- STAT LOSS!<br><br>Yes, stat loss, the Zombie Issue That Would Not Stay Dead, is still lying, dead and horse-like, being beaten into a dead and horse-like pulp by the asthmatic wizard of Truth and Dread Purity. You think it will stop. You hope it will stop. You <b>pray</b> it will stop. But it doesn't stop. It never stops. It will never stop. Seventy years on, when all of us are dead from the Chinese ICBMs, there will be a solitary figure roaming the blasted wastes, muttering darkly about how none if this would have happened if SunSword had LISTENED goddamit.<br><br>As the Lone Gunman says, "<font color="#77FF77">Give me some material and Ill rip it apart without even mentioning you or your playstyle.</font>" Well, aside from the fact that no one is actually bitching about my playstyle at the moment ("YOU ROLEPLAYER! YOU'RE NOT HURTING ANYONE! STOP IT, DAMN YOU! DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!!") Sir Adrick hasn't exactly posted any game system to rip apart, other then glittering generalities like "Stat loss is bad and player justice is good and the past was good and the present is bad and the players are suffering and no one is listening and GOD DAMN THESE BEETLES MAKE THEM STOP CLAWING MY EYES!" Or, in his words, which are probably somewhat less amusing than mine, "<font color="#77FF77">STOP ALLOWING GRIEF PLAYERS TO GIVE MURDER COUNTS - killing a player is only an act of grief when the dude killed is either unable to fight back or a newbie.</font>"<br><br>So, in Adrick's world, which is much darker and stormier then our own world, the grief players aren't the PKs. No. The grief players are the PK's VICTIMS! GOD DAMN THEM! HOW DARE THEY FIGHT BACK! <br><br>"Killing a player is only an act of grief when the dude killed is unable to fight back or a newbie." In this nutshell we have the core argument of the Dread Lords. Basically, that they should be allowed to kill anyone, at any time, for any reason at all. Unless they are [young], or link dead or something. Otherwise, rape on!<br><br>How do I argue against this point? It's like arguing against Elian Gonzalez. He's such a cute little kid, although in 5 years he's going to kill his entire classroom with an automatic weapon (whether in Cuba or Miami remains to be seen). <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/04/13/cubaboy.transcript/index.html">He says</a> that the answer to his problem is simple. "Dad, I do not want to go to Cuba. If you want to, stay here. I am not going to Cuba." Well, what are you going to tell him? He's six years old. YOU going to explain why it won't work out like that? I sure as hell won't. I feel the same way with Adrick. Explaining to Adrick why stat loss is a necessary evil in a game filled with imperfect people is like explaining to Elian why he can't have any more candy. The kid just keeps saying "WHY? WHY? WHY?" over and over. Eventually you just shake your head and start making fun of him, scarring him for life and driving him to update on web sites.<br><br>Eventually, the Elian story will end. And eventually, the Adrick story will end. Which one will end first? My money's on Elian. He's a cute kid and all, but he can't precast worth a damn.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000233.html">"DAMN IT, YOU ALL ARE MOCKING ME... I CAN TELL...

The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/2000-04/13/276l-041300-idx.html">Washington Post</a> yesterday featured a little think piece about online gaming.  Although a good portion of the article featured an interview with Stevie "KillCreek" Case (I don't fault this.  I would much rather interview a playboy model then someone like Tyrant.  Tyrant, although being a decent guy, does not look nearly as good in a bathing suit as KillCreek does.) it also mentioned MMORPGs.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">In the online multiplayer game EverQuest, for example, 55,000 subscribers may be playing at the same time during a peak period, and they're doing far more than slaying monsters. In this and other fantasy adventure games, like Ultima Online, some characters run inns; others are bards or thespians who give performances. Quake players make short movies out of the game's graphics. In other words, players are innovating, using the ostensible plot as mere landscape for their own creations. And they are forming communities that can exist only in a virtual space.</font><br><br>I would like to point out that I'm glad UO communities can only exist in virtual space.  If a UO community formed next door to me in real life, I would invest heavily in barbed wire and that M-60 I've been looking at.<br><br>The article then looks at what it means to spend time in a virtual environment, and what kind of learning occurs to those inside the game world.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">It begs the question: Do games change the mind?<br><br>"Of course they do," says Mike Merzenich, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. "It's rewarded, progressive learning. . . . If you master any skill, you make changes in the brain." <br><br>Merzenich explains that games--especially video games--give immediate positive feedback for every correct choice, prompting the release of neurotransmitters in the brain. That prompts direct learning, the type that occurs when a monkey gets food for pressing a lever. And because the learning is fast, focused and repetitive, games cause a great degree of limited learning in little time. Which means that after two hours of gaming, you could know a heck of a lot about how to get a virtual car to the end of a racetrack without crashing. What's not clear, Merzenich says, is whether you know anything else.<br><br>"Everything you learn is not all positive," Merzenich says. "If I'm completely  absorbed for long periods of time every day in doing something mindless . . . first of all, it reflects a lot of things I'm not doing. . . . It could be competing with a lot of other learning."<br><br>...those adults of the future will be a fascinating sort. They will possess what Seymour Papert of MIT's Media Lab calls "grasshopper mind"--a tendency to leap from one topic to another. They may become more referential, relying on their ability to access information quickly rather than hold it all in their heads...What does seem likely, though, is that a generation of fast-moving minds will expect information to be presented efficiently. In some cases, icons and images could substitute for the written word and 3-D landscapes could substitute for reports and pie charts. "I think there are new forms of literacy that are emerging," says Nideffer of the University of California.</font><br><br>Interesting stuff.  All of us have a story about how, after a long marathon bout of computer games, we've had difficulty in adjusting to the "real world".  My wife, a former UO player, once stopped the car when she saw a bird, thinking that I could use the feathers for my archer.  She quit playing shortly thereafter.  Approaching 30, most of my learning is behind me.  What about people who are 15 and spend half their lives in a virtual environment?  How will this new medium impact the way the way they view the real world?

Well, there's another company about to set loose one of these expansion things, and unlike <a href="http://www.origin.ea.com/">another company</a>, Verant is dropping behind on their payola checks. (hint to Brad: I wasn't joking about the whole gnome necro-Fiery Avenger thing. Come on, work it into the Vision(tm)! "He flames, he gets a flaming sword.") So let's get down to the latest news, shall we?<br><br>First off, on the <a href="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Gameplay&number=4&DaysPrune=10&LastLogin=">official Whineplay forum</a>, someone from my old server Veeshan made the quite reasonable <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032399.html">suggestion</a> that <a href="http://www.firesofheaven.net">Fires of Heaven</a> actually allow other EQ players to play the game. Members of FoH responded that, well, Veeshan is really, really crowded, and, um, FoH likes to kill stuff, and, er, they're good at it and stuff, and, um, did they mention they like to kill stuff? One of the stuff FoH likes to kill includes the supposedly unkillable <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/akera1.jpg">Inte Akera</a>, which is rumored to be involved with that Fiery Avenger thing that would look so fashionable on my gnome necro. (Did I mention my gnome necro was 10th level? That seems an appropriate level to wield the mightiest of paladin swords. Being two digits and all.) Anyway, since Sir Akera was supposedly unkillable, he was gifted with a <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/akera2.jpg">kick-ass sword</a>. A really, really, really <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/akera3.jpg">kick-ass sword</a>. (Which, come to think of it, seems really appropriate for a certain short caster I know.) Abashi hurriedly noted that the sword would be nerfed into the realms of actual physical probabilty, but it's unclear if there's still an FoH guy running around with EQ's version of the <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/akera4.jpg">one-hit-kill sword</a>.<br><br>However, you don't have to be in FoH to loot really kick-ass swords (unless you play on Veeshan, in which case, yes, you do actually have to be in FoH to loot really kick-ass swords. I think that's in the guide manual now.) See, there's this shadowknight sword called Soul Leech, which is only found on Cazic Thule. Cazic Thule happens to be a god, which if you ever played D&D in high school, means that he is killed as soon as he appears. (Gods ain't as powerful as they used to be, donchaknow.) The problem with Soul Leech is that it's a "no-drop" weapon, so if anyone besides a shadowknight loots it, it's just a worthless piece of metal. And if you loot it accidentally, you <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030128.html">aren't going to get any help</a> switching it to a more appropriate character. Unless, of course, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/algarrz/Burning.jpg">you know Brad</a>.<br><br>But, of course, even knowing Brad isn't much of a help if you've pre-ordered Ruins of Kunark. Not only is it cheaper for most folks outside the US to actually have a friend in the US fed ex them a copy from the store shelves then to pre-order it from Verant, but the shipping fulfillment house has been somewhat erratic, to say the least. Despite all orders supposedly going out on the 12th, some have been delivered already, some just shipped today (one of those being mine) and some just are lost in the great Twilight Zone that is e-commerce order fulfillment. Again, it doesn't mean a whole lot to most folks, since the expansion isn't even opening until the 24th, but quite a few people want to pre-load the CD, and sit anxiously by the zone lines, waiting for the second the expansion pops open, praying and hoping against hope that they are allowed to kill something before FoH gets to it.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000234.html">Gnomes.

Ahhh yes.  Adrick.  The ultimate in waffles.  With sicky sweet blueberry-flavored corn syrup no less.  Breakfast food with a punch.  Myself, I prefer maple -- especially after having spent 12 years in New England.  Different strokes for different folks.  I also don't have this raging addiction to announcing I am quitting everytime the development team does something I don't like.  <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com">Can I offer you some cheese with that whine?</a>  Oh right. We were talking about breakfast food.<br><br>How many times can Adrick quit UO?  In lieu of actual news or a game company snafu I thought we might play a guessing game.  Today's guessing game is a two-fold endeavor.  1) How many times will Adrick quit in year 2000?  2) How many times will he rake OSI over the coals for something he does on a regular basis himself.<br><br>Case in point -- quitting UO, Adrick style (sung to the tune of Love American Style for those of you old enough to remember that POS TV show).  Adrick would never do something like rake OSI over the coals for making a promise and not keeping it (*cough*necromancy*cough) and then not live up to a promise himself.  No not him.  He keeps all his promises.  Every time he threatens to quit he actually does quit.  In this same way OSI delivers up necromancy.  You see its a virtual thing.  OSI actually DOES deliver necromancy.  And Adrick really does quit.  You just can't tell... cause its like.. virtual and stuff. You think I jest but no I'm serious.  Here it is in Adrick's very own words. "Yea I am impulsive as hell - I did cancel one account and I havent played in two days."  Whoa two whole days.  Man that had to set some sort of record.  But see, this sets a whole new type of definition to delivering on your promises.  OSI can patch through necromancy for two seconds and then revert the shard to wipe the patch.  We won't actually HAVE necromancy but then again we don't exactly have an absence of Adrick so you see these things will balance and the gaming world will enter this odd sort of equilibrium.<br><br>I almost hate to do this because picking on Adrick is just way too easy.  This is on top of the fact that I could write novellas about Adrick's logic.  Or lack thereof.  Yet another case in point -- Adrick's list about how to fix UO.  Someone who quits UO as much as he does and of course has SO much game design time under his belt should certainly be able to offer a few clues to Runesabre and Sunsword so I hope they read his list.  I know I did.  After saying that UO is fine the way it is.. err no the way it was.. way back in the days when he could be a grief pker and be proud of it (now grief players are all blue dontcha know?  Yeah we all long for those days when all grief players were red and had dreadlord in front of their name and there were absolutely no penalties for being an asshole. That's the way uh huh uh huh I like it uh huh uh huh) and UO needs no new code.  Except of course: "10] Give us a necromancy class and a cleric class and remove mager as the only skill of magic."  But what the hell, that hardly takes any code at all.  Right guys?  <br><br>Ahh I could go on for days but I'll stop here.  I'm beginning to feel guilty for picking on the intellectually challenged.

Yesterday, <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000228.html">a great deal of firepower was unleashed</a>. Ground zero: Austin, Texas. UO:R was store-shelved while the proposed <a href="http://update.uo.com/dev-comments.html">Faction System was production-shelved</a>, and a great many people aired frustrations, including myself. In one of our discussion forums, someone made mention of my "anti-UO bias" and how this bias "colors every one of [my] rants." It made me rethink a few things, and question whether I did, in fact, have a bias against OSI and Ultima Online. I came to the conclusion that yes, I am unfair and biased. But that is not always a bad thing, and it is not always borne of bad intentions.<br><br>When I was growing up, my father was tough. If I got a B+, I could have had an A. If I got an A-, I could have had an A+. It was frustrating, but in hindsight, I know that he was simply keeping me challanged. I continued to apply myself diligently, and learned that nothing short of a best effort is good enough. He never questioned the grade point average of the kid who lived next door. He never scolded the kid who lived next door. My father never grounded the kid who lived next door. Why not? Because my father didn't love the kid who lived next door, and didn't give him a second thought. I was his son, and he had a vested interest in seeing me achieve my fullest potential. To others, he may have appeared to be a "tyrant", and a "tough parent", but if any kid ever needed continual shoving and pushing, it was me.<br><br>I think Ultima Online is the greatest thing to happen to my computer since the <a href="http://www.fatman.com/">Adlib card</a> was invented. I have three <a href="http://my.uo.com/cgi-bin/my_chars.pl?60aeec3eff33a5f3c3eff072e4e3fc929208daf1b14c28a4f5d3659d1bc06a47">UO accounts</a>, and I play an average of 1.5 hours every day of my life. I don't log in to refresh houses, and I don't log in to stock vendors. I log in and I <i>play</i>. Shocking, but true. I don't have an EverQuest account and I never will. Personally, I think 3D polygon graphics are still about 15 years away from looking good. Right now, the best 3D technology still looks like crap. I've built better looking "worlds" out of Legos. I also hate FPS hack-n-slash shooters. Clearly, I'm all alone in that, but after <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/killer/doommac.html">Doom II</a>, I had my fill of keyboard combat. It's just not my style. That is nothing against Verant, but they made a product I think is ugly, and because 95% of it's "sales pitch" is all about the pretty colors, I'm not buying it. I also don't care if the upcoming EQ expansion is a cardboard box full of dead mice. Sell dead mice, Verant. Make a billion dollars. God bless. You're the kid who lives next door. My "son" on the other hand, Ultima Online, has alot of potential to be something great. So when the UO Dev team brings home a report card full of C grades and B- grades, I'll probably look at it and say, "If you had only put a bit more effort into it, you could have had all B grades."<br><br>Yesterday, the UO Dev team brought me a D- and I may have over-reacted. Verant is probably bringing home a D- on Friday as well, but I don't care (again, it's the kid who lives next door). So that's why, inspite of the fact I have multiple UO accounts, I might come across as an OSI hater. It isn't out of hate or negative bias. It is because UO is something I care about. Yes, I know it's just a game. For those of you concerned, I promise to discuss this  obsession with my therapist. Considering <a href="http://www.casacolumbia.org/">all the things in life I could be obesessed with right now</a>, I think a computer game falls under the category of "healthy and safe", but that is a matter for another day.<br><br>UO Dev Team: If you apply yourselves, and work a little harder, you can bring home straight A's.

Well, Origin knew you were going to be pissed, even if your name isn't <a href="http://www.evilavatar.com/">Evil Avatar</a>. SunSword already has some <a href="http://update.uo.com/comments.html">comments on the Faction yanking</a> up.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">As you may already know (and is usually the case even when you have a team as good as this one) a bizarre train of events have conspired against our efforts to finalize our testing and we have to make some tough choices about what we can keep and what we must remove from the update to make our dates. In order to meet our goals of quality and timeliness, we have decided to delay The Faction System. The reason for this decision is two-fold. First, The Faction System was not part of the original UO: Renaissance plan. Second, the system is so complex that it would easily add another 3-5 days to QA&#8217;s testing schedule.</font><br><br>"Fast, accurate, good. Choose two."<br><br>Frankly, my concern isn't so much the faction system - as I said below, in its current state, it holds little interest for me. Could it be developed into something better? Sure. Is it right now? No. But that's a sideshow.<br><br>What is really interesting is the decision that was made to fire UO:R out the door, into software stores, before it was completed. And that there was no decision to delay its release once it was obvious that the server-side work wasn't completed.<br><br>It's all about money. UO:R is Origin's bid to keep UO on the shelves, in a shiny new box complete with the obligatory breastcentric artwork. The people stocking Best Buy and CompUSA don't give a crap that UO is at its core over three years old. They don't care that what's in the box is basically a collection of the latest patches in a new CD.<br><br>No, it's a new box. It's a new game. It goes on the shelves, and Joe Consumer, who doesn't read web sites, who doesn't read the gaming press, who actually, you know, has a life, picks it up and goes "Hmm, this looks interesting. And only $20! Damn."<br><br>Now, <i>and this is purely theory on my part that has no confirmation</i>, it looks like there was an ultimatum laid down somewhere - whether from EA, Origin's paymasters, or the distribution channels that you never hear about that control what games get what all-important shelf space - said that god damn it, UO:R <b>will</b> be on the goddamned shelves by April 12th, no matter <b>what</b>. And lo, so it is. Sort of.<br><br>Probably the same folks that said that god damn it, Ultima 9 <b>would</b> be on the goddamned shelves before Christmas, no matter <b>what</b>. And lo, so it was. It didn't actually <i>run</i>, but that was a minor detail.<br><br>Want to know why UO:R is really out? Here's the answer - it's in this very informative <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/Features/Exclusives/Retail/index.html?tag=st.cn.sr1.dir.">article</a> from Gamecenter. It's two years old, but it still is valid. Basically, the game companies are in thrall to the publishers and the distributors. It's all about money.<br><br>As most of you would say, "Duh."<br><br>In the scheme of things, is all this a really big deal? Probably not. The UO servers will no doubt be patched up next Tuesday or the Thursday after that or whatever, and shortly thereafter no one will remember that there was a small, one or two week gap between what was being sold on store shelves and what was actually on the servers. It's not like Daikatana, where the damn thing's been in limbo for three years now. We're only talking a couple of weeks.<br><br>It's all about money.

Calandryll posted the following to the UO Dev Board:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">As many of you have pointed out, the faction system has some issues that need to be resolved. Rather than publish in an incomplete system and/or push back our current publish schedule, we are going to move the Faction System into General Testing...it will not be in the next publish. <br>However, we still absolutely plan on implementing this system into the game. The faction system will be published onto the shards most likely in the next few weeks (so no alchemy/necromancy comments ok? :P) following the UO:R publish.<br><br>In the meantime, I did write up the changes for the faction system (including the fact that you cannot attack members of your own faction at all) and that update is now listed in General Testing.<br><br>Now, to answer some questions you may have concerning this and UO:R in general. First, the faction system is not listed on the UO:R box as a feature of UO:R. Second, speaking of that, we are currently writing a communication regarding the shipping of UO:R and the UO:R publish itself. Note that the UO:R patch itself has already be sent to all existing customers. Anyway, expect to see the communication later today. :)</font><br><br>Well, I'd be more pissy about this if it weren't obvious that the faction system wasn't ready for prime time yet. Frankly, there is so little implemented with the faction system in its current state, if it <b>were</b> implemented I, and few others, would bother with it. As <a href="http://update.uo.com/design_175.html">currently implemented</a>, all it is is a massive game of Capture the Flag. There's no real permanence, no true effect on the environment other than setting town NPC vendor pricing (gee, you think people might buy goods from PC vendors? Or maybe in Trammel, which is immune from hostile takeovers?), and no reason for people to actually join a faction. In game fiction? <a href="http://town.uo.com/bnn/index.html">Last I checked</a> it died March 26. The cutbacks that struck OSI March 30 are <b>just a coincidence</b>, I'm sure ... Origin would <b>never</b> gut a program that gained them universal applause and approval, would they? Naw, they wouldn't do that. Must be a coincidence. <br><br>We were promised PvP with meaning. We were promised a way to affect the world, to participate in an overarching storyline that would give players a reason beyond just gang-banging the enemy of the week for their regs and lewt. <br><br>We were promised more than just a point system that was already put into place on Abyss a year ago. We were promised something to fight for, something that would keep everyone from packing up and moving to the happy lands of Trammel, something more to the point that would keep everyone from just cancelling UO and nagging Shadowbane to start the goddamned beta already.<br><br>Hey Origin - don't bother putting in a faction system. Just put it on the shelf along with alchemy and necromancy and everything else held out to the player base as a carrot to keep them going past the bugs and the pissant support and the server downtimes and the crappy ISPs and the client that still is even more latency dependent than Quake. What the hell, the masses seem happy beating each other for no reason.

This is from <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/aradune.html">Lum's interview with Brad McQuaid (aka Aradune)</a>.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Lum: We can pretty safely assume that spell casters will get new spells; what about melee characters? What will they get in new skills past level 50? Will they get higher skill caps in general, or are new skills available?<br><br>Aradune: The pure melee classes get new skills of a sort -- they're called disciplines. The casters and hybrid classes get new spells. All classes have many of their level caps for the skills they already have raised.<br><br>Lum: Can you go into more detail about disciplines? How are they different from the current EQ skill system?<br><br>Aradune: Disciplines are quite different, and currently being tuned on Test extensively, so I can't go into any more detail as to how they work at this point, sorry.</font><br><br>OK.  This is from the <a href="http://sb.stratics.com/cgi-bin/faq_gen/6.5.shtml">Stratics Shadowbane FAQ</a>.<br><br><font color="blue">What kind of multi-class format will Shadowbane have?</font> <br><br><font color="#77FF77"><b>Disciplines</b> are basically Shadowbane's answer to Multi/Dual Classing. Our basic philosophy (in design) has been to offer a level of "sub classing" whereby characters can pick up additional powers/skills/etc, but at a cost -- your level potential drops in your primary class. As opposed primary class choices, we call these subclass options <b>"Disciplines."</b></font><br><br><font color="blue">I am an old school RPG'er from way back when. Will Shadowbane allow me to create one of my all time favorite multi class characters? Specifically, the Fighter/Mage?</font><br><br><font color="#77FF77">Fighter/Mage characters (and other types of multi classed characters) will be possible, of a sort. (I have to add that in, because in actuality you always have one primary class, and can have a few other 'subclasses' I guess they could be called. Actually, we call them <b>'Disciplines.'</b>)<br><br>So in this case, your best bet would be to either: Choose Fighter as your apprenticeship (aka 'base class'), pick a fighter's specialization (aka your 'class') and then pick a few <b>disciplines</b> that will grant you powers. Alternatively, you could start with a Mage's apprenticeship, pick a Mage specialization (Wizard, Channeler, whatever) and then take a few fighting <b>Disciplines</b> to beef up your combat abilities.<br><br>Word to the wise, though -- there are a set number of hours in the day. Taking <b>Disciplines</b> means that you're taking time away from your primary class -- as such, don't be surprised if you don't do as well in your primary class as others who stick with their specialization.</font><br><br><font color="white">This is from yet another <a href="http://sb.stratics.com/cgi-bin/faq_gen/6.7.shtml">Stratics Shadowbane FAQ</a>.</font><br><br><font color="blue">What can you tell us about this <b>Discipline</b> system you keep referring to?</font><br><br><font color="#77FF77">The <b>Disciplines</b> system could take the place of Trade skills, but allow me to be pretty straight-forward here -- the only trade skills we'll be implementing will be the ones that directly affect Combat. Blacksmithing will be a means of repairing your weapons and armor. Alchemy will be a means of creating potions that help you recover mana and fatigue in Combat.  We're not going to be putting in fishing, baking, or basket weaving. <br><br>The other point I want to reiterate is that taking on additional <b>Disciplines</b> means you'll be spending that much of your time and energy NOT paying attention to your primary class -- so people who specialize, and resist the temptation to wear multiple hats, will be better than you (in the long run) at your primary profession. We aren't building a game in which the greatest Wizard will also be the best Fighter. When you do it, you set a standard whereby *everyone* would have to be a Tank-Mage to compete, and that completely undermines PvP combat.<br><br><b>Disciplines</b> will allow people to get different combinations of Skills and Powers." This is exactly the kind of character variation that we think keeps the game exciting over the long haul.</font> <br><br><font color="white">Now, just in case you really had any doubt that the folks over at Wolfpack have talked about Disciplines <b>A LOT</B> a <a href="http://sb.stratics.com/cgi-bin/database/db.cgi?db=default&uid=default&Subject=---&Developer=---&Message=disciplines&sb=4&so=descend&view_records=Search">search of the message board database on Stratics</a> came up with no less than 10 posts by various Shadowbane developers on the subject of disciplines.<br><br>Can you say stealing from the competition?  I knew you could.<br><br>Of course this sort of unethical behavior from the people who wanted carte blanche to search your hard drive in their desire to remove 'cheating programs,' or whose game shows an astounding similarity to DikuMud should come as no surprise.  Of course, being a responsible journalist I should say now that we all KNOW it isn't DikuMud and that they DID NOT copy any code or do anything, you know, illegal and stuff, and of course its mere coincidence that they would add Disciplines to their expansion after the folks at Wolfpack have been talking about it for over six months.  Next thing you know they'll be telling us they thought of this 2 years ago and were only waiting for the expansion to implement it and that the folks at Shadowbane are copying EQ -- even though no one at EQ has said a word about Disciplines anywhere ever up until now. <br><br>This is the same company that brought us EQ -- that SO original game where you kill monsters, get stuff, go up levels, kill bigger monsters, get more stuff, go up more levels...  Now where have I seen <a href="http://www.gamestorm.com/adventure/legends">that idea before</a>?  I know if I think about it long enough <a href="http://www.dikumud.com/diku/diku.asp">it will come to me</a>.<br><br>But no.. no.. I understand that similar ideas occur to the same people at the same time and this is just one marvelous coincidence. How fortunate for Verant.  How unfortunate for Wolfpack.  <br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000227.html">What does it avail a man to gain a fortune and lose his soul?</a><br>  <br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem955557582,20950,"></a>

And new players who buy UO:R looking for a place safe from evil peekays and a l33t new Occlo to quest in are going to be surprised to find... well, the same UO we've had for a while now. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing: the past six months has been awfully good for UO. Bugs have been patched, the client's been optimized, and as the peekays will tell you early and often, they're already an endangered species anyway.<br><br>The client-side features of UO:R have already been patched in, and the heavy lifting remains to be done on the server-side. So presumably Origin felt it pretty safe to press the gold master of UO:R.

I was reading the comments on the departures from OSI.  I have rarely seen so many people unable to look at the big picture.<br><br>OSI now has two, and only two, products. UO and UO2.  They have nothing else in development.  If Raph Koster and Rich Vogel are really gone I think we can safely assume that UO3 is on hold for the time being.<br><br>What happens if UO2 bombs?  What happens to OSI if all that is left is UO?  There's a plethora of MMORPGs being developed right now.  UO2 is likely to hit the shelves amidst a LOT of competition.  It better be good.<br><br>UO has a lot of loyal customers but it also has the distinction of being the first MMORPG among the big three.  Consequently it has a large percentage of customers holding on to established accounts with large houses.  What happens to UOs customer base when Shadowbane, UO2, Star Wars Online and 3 or four other games are out there?  Yeah there are more customers out there that do not yet play MMORPGs.  Unfortunately none of these games are going to attract that much of a new customer base... there simply isn't that much new about them.  They are all still the same old kill-things-or-other-people-based games and those aren't likely to reach out to those who are currently non-gamers.  These games will continue to serve the same customer base they are serving now.  As UO begins to lose more and more of that customer base, EA will, one day, find it unprofitable to continue to support UO.  If EA is, as so many say, pulling the strings here, how much patience will they have when UO is bringing in a nominal profit, nothing new is on the horizon, and their stock prices are stable or dropping?  <br><br>Will UO and UO2 be enough to carry OSI?<br><br>OSI has now lost all its great visionaries.  A great game takes a great vision these days.  No longer will it suffice to slap a ton of monsters on a 3d engine and say "ok folks -- go kill um!"  Garriott, the heart and soul of all the Ultimas is gone.  Now Raph Koster and Rich Vogel are gone.  They take their extensive knowledge born of many years of online gaming themselves.  How is this a good thing?  With all due respect to Ubiq and the rest of the UO2 team -- they have not yet delivered a product.  They could be great visionaries -- UO2 could be the greatest thing since sliced bread.  But we don't know.  It doesn't matter much because until UO2 comes out they have a project and are not likely to be moved to UO3, or anything else for that matter.<br><br>I didn't even really enjoy UO until Runesabre and Sunsword took over, however they took over a project well into production.  Have they ever designed anything from conception? Do they even have concepts?  Do we really want them gone from the UO Live team?  I know I don't.  I think they've done a bang-up job with UO and I'd like to see them continue.  Doesn't seem to matter though -- EA doesn't seem to want any new concepts over at OSI. Regardless,  without looking at a roster of OSI employees it looks like they are now two of OSI's most experienced developers.  And they have a project.<br><br>OSI has lost the majority of their most experienced people. Who will work at OSI now?  The stories I hear about the working conditions and the atmosphere at OSI are abysmal at best.  I'm not going into the details because what I hear is unsubstantiated rumor at best and malicious gossip at worst -- but you hear enough rumors and you begin to wonder if at least one or two of them might not have a basis in fact.  If I were an experienced developer and heard all the rumors circulating in the industry I'd be inclined to look elsewhere for a job.  Its all well and good to hire people who have no game design experience, pay them a pittance, and tell them to design a game.  Maybe they'll come up with something good -- maybe they won't.  Its a crap shoot.  Can OSI really afford to gamble in today's market?<br><br>If Dupre, Designer Dragon and the rest of the UO3 team are indeed gone from OSI this is a sad day for the gaming world and the death knell of an era.  I have no desire to see OSI fail or go under or lose good developers and unless you are the recruitment manager at another gaming company neither should you.  This company and these people have inspired hours of fun gaming, a thriving online community, the website you are reading right now and quite possibly the one you will visit after you've finished here, to say the least.  To hear of an entire team leaving a company en masse speaks volumes about the company they are leaving.   For my own part I hope that this is not the beginning of the end for OSI.  It would truly be a shame to see this once bright gem of the gaming world, however currently tarnished, be shattered and broken and forever lose its luster.  <br><br><i>*The quotes above and below are by Ambrose Bierce, from <u>The Devil's Dictionary</u>, 1911</i><br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000223.html">HADES, n.

Got this chat log from a hopeful treasure hunter whose hopes were cruelly dashed by a GM:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Last night, three friends and I were doing a level 5 treasure map. We arrived at the chest site to find an empty chest in the spot where our chest was buried. When we dug up the chest, it came up under the first chest (a problem that has not been fixed since treasure maps were introduced to the game.) We entered a request for a GM to remove the empty chest for us.<br><br>After some time, an unseen GM moved the empty chest aside and we thanked him, but got no response. We were positioned as always when doing chests, standing on top of one another. It is the way we have always done maps; it is the way everyone we've ever known has done them. This prevents the monsters from targeting players when they appear, then players can strategically eliminate the monsters. It has been considered a tactical manuever, certainly nothing we ever dreamed would be considered an exploit.<br><br>As soon as our chest was accessible, the treasure hunter in our group<br>picked the lock and we began to remove the contents. The first thing that spawned was a daemon that promptly attacked one of the members of our group. This surprised us, but we killed the creature and got back into position to resume looting the chest. Two more monsters spawned and they attacked us, also. We dispatched them and stacked up on each other again. We all pondered what was going on, but are used to strange things happening from time to time in the game, so we didn't think too much of it.<br><br>It was then that GM Maleki appeared to us and said:<br><br>GM Maleki: Howdy<br>DragonBane: hail<br>GM Maleki: whats you are doing is a exploit<br>GM Maleki: I do not wanna see you doing this again<br>DragonBane: really<br>Magill: What?<br>GM Maleki: is this clear<br>GM Maleki: I have noted each of your accounts<br>Magill: What is an exploit?<br>Skewer Rat: what?<br>DragonBane: i wasnot aware of that<br>GM Maleki: You know exactly what is, stacking on each other<br>GM Maleki: so they dont attack you<br>GM Maleki: Please do not do this again<br><br>Our mouths fell open. An exploit?! Four veteran players, one a former counselor and none of us had ever heard such a thing. We began contacting friends to see if any of them were aware that this strategy was illegal and no one else had ever heard of this, either. I sent a page to speak again with a GM. Maleki appeared:<br><br>GM Maleki: Hey guys<br>GM Maleki: you relize how this is a exploit<br>GM Maleki: correct?<br>Magill: No, I'm sorry<br>Magill:  I don't<br>DragonBane: there has never been a post about it<br>DragonBane: any where<br>Magill: until policy is posted about it.<br>GM Maleki: Ok stacking on each other<br>GM Maleki: so the monsters do not attack you<br>DragonBane: un mark my account<br>Magill: Do you do this to everyone who does chests?<br>DragonBane: i have plated 3 years<br>GM Maleki: is not the way it is designed<br>GM Maleki: Yes sir<br>Skewer Rat: Ok so is it getting fixed?<br>GM Maleki: Everyone I catch we warn<br>DragonBane: i have played 3 years<br>Magill: Something<br>DragonBane: no marks<br>Magill: needs to be posted about this.<br>GM Maleki: Your just being warned,<br>Skewer Rat: aye same here<br>Magill: This is not fair.<br>DragonBane: is my account amrked<br>Magill: I want the mark off my account.<br>Skewer Rat: I want the mark off as well<br>Baltizar: aye<br>DragonBane: is my account amrked<br>GM Maleki: Mamn, nothing is being done to you except a warning, this is the post<br>Skewer Rat: and I want a post on the website about it<br>Magill: No<br>GM Maleki: if we posted and I caught you doing this<br>Skewer Rat: and iwould like an email<br>Magill: A public post<br>Skewer Rat: saying it is a bug and being fixed<br>Magill: about this being an exploit<br>Skewer Rat: fromt he dev team member<br>GM Maleki: Ok I cannot debate this<br>DragonBane: is my account marked<br>GM Maleki: Im asking you all<br>GM Maleki: not to do this again<br>DragonBane: is my account marked<br>You see: pampas grass<br>Baltizar: Is our accounts marked<br>GM Maleki: you all have been given a fair warning, goodluck</font><br><br>Now, I've done a few treasure hunts in my time, and I've never thought of dogpiling all together in an attempt to evade the AI. Our method of opening treasure chests was simple: we brought a bard. You know, it's kind of <b>what they do</b>. <br><br>I asked around and apparently what they described is an exploit, although not one that's been explained (as you'd think it would be if <b>everyone</b> was doing it as the stackers purported).

You have 48 hours, Origin.<br><br>It has been my experience that <a href="http://www.ebworld.com/ebx/default.asp">Electronics Boutique</a> is rarely wrong...by more than a day or two.

Let's talk spelunking. <br><br>If I were <a href="http://netnow.micron.net/~philco/seinfeld/soup.htm">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, I would probably begin this piece with saying something blindingly obvious, like "What's up with all these dungeons, anyway?".  However, if I were Jerry Seinfeld, I would also be ridiculously rich and chasing around <a href="http://www.shoshanna.com/">children half my age with huge breasts</a>. So I'm not really Jerry.  Let's not speak of this again.<br><br>However, the question remains; why is every ORPG fascinated with The Dungeon Experience? Well, the obvious answer is that every ORPG is crafted by guys who <a href="http://members.xoom.com/WebWarlock/mst3k/">played Dungeons and Dragons in high school</a>. And, as this web page says, <a href="http://www.execpc.com/~dlbrown/logos/dnd-bv.html">in D & D "non-human soldiers" are expected to "rape freely at every chance."</a> It's really hard to argue with free rape. Thus you have dungeons and dragons in every ORPG. (Asheron's Call having no dragons that I know of, has hundreds of dungeons to help make up for it.) Dragons are kind of a no-brainer... wickedly smart lizard that breathes fire and sits on a ton of money; yeah, that just screams "<a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra/lordnagafen.html">boss monster</a>". But the whole dungeon thing is getting really, really done to death.<br><br>I mean, picture the design decisions being made here. You've got all the best loot and all the most challenging monsters, in a small, tightly-confined space. Hmmm. Any problems here yet? In Ultima Online, this makes dungeons prime PK territory -- I mean, once again, you have all the best loot on the most challenging monsters (other players) in small, tightly confined spaces. There are no PKs in Everquest, with the result that you have very nice, very organized players that methodically loot every dungeon spawn as soon as it comes up. In fact in the most popular dungeons you have waiting lists. You know, in our D&D campaign in high school, this simply did not happen. "You enter the Tomb of Horrors. A paladin meets you at the door and wants to put your name on the list for the next Vecna spawn." "<a href="http://www.rickwyatt.com/tce/jesusdd.txt">I shoot him in the head with my crossbow.</a> I roll a 20." "Sorry, this campaign has a PK switch. Your crossbow misfires and hits a cute fluffy bunny." "HEY! I was camping the fluffy bunny spawn!" "Uh.... sorry..." Then again, unlike the "<a href="http://delusion.smart.net/chyx/">Dark Dungeons</a>" tract, our DM was not <a href="http://www.rpg.net/252/quellen/darkdungeons/dd04-small.gif">some slinky goth chick in velvet</a>, either.

Just as a short addenda to Great Bob's post, here's the new EQ EULA which went into force today (yes, folks, next time you log in you get to click through TWO EULAs)<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Auction or Sale of Characters, Items and Coin<br><br>We have consistently advised all players -- through newsgroup postings and otherwise -- that selling items and/or coin is inappropriate gameplay. In addition to violating our agreement, selling or auctioning accounts, characters, items and/or coin violates our legal rights and may constitute misappropriation, interference with our contract with the users who quit in frustration, and tarnishes the goodwill in the EverQuest name.<br><br>The User Agreement and Software License, which you choose to affirmatively accept every time you reenter the game, prohibits the sale of accounts, characters, items and/or coin -- whether by auction (e.g. eBay) or otherwise. The User Agreement, in sections 1 and 7, prohibits the transfer of an EverQuest account and software, and in sections 6 and 10 prohibits, among other things, gameplay which is inappropriate and actions which place an unreasonably large load on our infrastructure.  Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement provide that we own all property rights in the game, subject to your license to play the game.<br><br>To further emphasize these points, effective immediately, the following language shall be added to the end of section 8 of the User Agreement and as a section in the EverQuest rules of conduct:<br><br>You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material.</font><br><br>I personally think that "eBay farming" -- turning what should be a game into a profit-making enterprise -- is one of the fastest ways to destroy any online game.

In the bad craziness of the great EQ debate over privacy, another big story was overlooked.<br><br><font color="#00CC00">"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material."</font><br><br>E-bay no more?  Is this a wave of the future?  Can it work?  Will other companies follow suit?  Let's take a peak into the good, the bad and the ugly of this situation.<br><br><b>The Good</b><br><br>There was once a time when one could actually buy a house deed, and have a chance of placing it.  I know, this sounds like fiction, but it was true.  When players left the game they actually allowed their homes to decay.  Then came E-bay.  OSI nodded and winked at the auctions, and the population became homeless overnight...unless, of course, they were wiling to shell out some benjamins. Suddenly, the dynamic changed, and the good intentions of the Dev team with regard to finite rescources crumbled. If you're leaving the game, why sell your house for in game gold when you could get some beer money?  This folks, is a no brainer.  In EQ, camping became more than a playstyle.  It became a job.<br><br><b>The Bad</b><br><br>So should we pop open the champaign corks just yet?  Well, let's think about this.  You see, <i>people who have lives don't have time to sit in front of a computer screen playing a damn game 6 hours a day</i>.  I know this can be tough to relate to.  After all, when we get home from work we play these games.  At work we load up Lum's and other web sites.  We are not normal people.  Should games be playable only by those with obsesive compulsive traits?  Let's say you make 20 dollars an hour at your job.  Now imagine an ingame object that costs 36,000 gold.  If you make 6,000 gold an hour in game, you're looking at 6 hours of labor.  That's 120 dollars in real world money, folks.  Given that, does it make any sense <i>not</i> to just purchase a 7xGM character with a house for 400 dollars?  You see, <i>these games aren't that much fun at early levels</i>.  UO is the worst offender.  Try making a new character on a new shard.  Tell me how long before you just get bored of the character building aspects. People pay thousands of dollars for hobbies like golf or fishing.  Why not MMORPGs?<br><br><b>The Ugly</b><br><br>The biggest problem, however, boils down to one of enforcement.  Is Verant going to be monitoring E-bay?  Web pages?  IRC chats?  Everytime a character gives an item of value to another player, will they launch an investigation?  Perhaps Verant should take a hard look at OSI's attempt to end macroing.  <i>As long as an object in game has "value" people are going to try an profit from it</i>.  It's in our nature as people to assign value to our posessions.<br><br>The medium of online games is evolving.  Every decision made by a company should be looked at closely.  This one bears a special level of scrutiny.  Do we flock to the banner of "mad" Richard and embrace the notion of real world money for in game value, or do we take Verant's lead and try to put a stop to it once and for all?  This story, I am sure, is going to be developing for a good long time.<br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000215.html">I may just put my Lum account up for sale!</a> <br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem955034166,27060,"></a>

Kirk "Runesabre" Black, UO's Lead Programmer, has been pretty active on the Dev Board as UO:R creaks its way out the door. Yesterday was PvP day (as opposed to the usual Player vs Company that we treasure so much at LumCorp). Here's the manifesto he posted:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">A large part of my goal with the PvP changes is to try and encourage incorporating various, diverse tactics to successfully engage in PvP. Simply thnking away with a bow or running with a sword and shield without changing up your tactics should not, in my opinion, win you battles though of course if that's the style you choose you should still be able to stay in the fight without getting blown away in the first 20 seconds. <br><br>With all the new tactics, various characters can be built to have their own strengths and tactics. I can imagine one character with Fencing and Archery. Stun your opponent with a spear early on, whip out your poisoned kryss, poison them, then keep beating on them with that spear. Maybe throw in a well-timed purple potion when you think they are about to cast that In Vas Mani and interupt them or at least get in that residual damage while firing away from a distance with your bow and healing up with bandages.<br><br>Or make a Wrestler/Macer character. Disarm your opponent, stun him on occasion and crack his skull with the war hammer or beat his armor off with that war mace while blocking his damage with a shield.<br><br>And of course all the Mage variations you can think of.<br><br>At any rate, what I am getting at is the goal with the PvP changes are to encourage diversity in style and tactics that don't center around a standard one or two clones and well established combos and all else being worth nothing.<br><br>Of course there are probably several things that need to be adjusted to reach that goal fully and if you have ideas on what those adjustments need to be, I welcome you to send me your thoughts.</font><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000214.html">Well, you heard the man.

Despite what you may read here and elsewhere, Verant <i>occasionally</i> has their head on straight. (Say it isn't so, Lum!)<br><br>Up until yesterday, I thought that Verant's plan for Kunark suffered from "Level 50 Fixation". All the development work we've seen (and most of the questions asked by users) focused on the new 51-60 level curve -- new spells, supposed new "abilities" (like skills, only harder to use, I gather), new zones, etc. <br><br>This doesn't really impress casual players (like, say, <b>me</b>) who don't have the time nor the total lack of anything else to do necessary to achieve level 50. Yes, some of us are still piddling around with our lowbies, running away from griffins, jumping up and down when we actually loot a bronze weapon, and laughing our asses off at those 300 people milling around Lower Guk waiting for a poor froggie to begin his short, painful 3 seconds of life.<br><br>Thankfully, Verant is apparently adding stuff for those slow learners among us. Things like a <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/necromancer/spelldescriptions.asp?SpellID=328">Defoliant</a> spell for Necros, apparently for the jungles in Kunark. (Something in me <b>really</b> likes the thought of a necro with napalm.) <br><br>Despite what you read on message boards, there are folks in EQ who <b>don't</b> mindlessly powerlevel to the top as fast as they inhumanly can.

Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn shows why he earns the big bucks, as in the aftermath of much good will towards Verant, complains about those stupid, deluded fools who had some problem with Verant poking around their user's systems:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Unfortunately it is a case where paranoia ended up winning out. I think that we could definitely have done a better job explaining what it was we were doing, and that would have lead to a bit more buy-in. Instead, some people decided to make up reports that we were scanning directory trees (false), internet files (false), internet history (false), cookies (false), and email (false), and unfortunately many people believed them. <br><br>The general paranoia resulted from the assumption that we (meaning: our servers) were actively collecting information from your system. This simply wasn't the case. The client simply would examine a small subset of information on your system, none of it containing information personally identifiable to a third party, and only send it to our server in the event that you were "running" an illegal program at the same time you ran EQ. We had absolutely no interest in what was installed on your system, only what you were running when you connected to ours. <br><br>I think privacy is important as well, but I don't really care about what a piece of client software is doing on my system. I only care when that piece of client software is transmitting information from my system to an outside source. In this case, the only time any data transmission was to take place was when something bad was found by the client. There was to be no server-side analysis of raw data. I'm sure that most people would agree that we do have a right to insure that our software license is being complied with. <br><br>In any case, I guess it's water under the bridge now. I'll blame Hollywood for all of the misunderstandings</font><br><br>Gee, a bit bitter, are we? Once again, for the slow readers in the audience, the problem was not with Verant "enforcing compliance of their software license", but in modifying said license so that compliance could be <b>anything they said it was</b>. <br><br>Yes, some folks posted alarmist and (in my belief) untrue reports of Verant scooping up IE cache data and sending it back to their servers. The problem isn't that Verant is doing this -- the problem is that, with the proposed general "we can do what we want" language proposed, <i><b>they could</b></i>, legally. Say, to check eBay cookies to look for people violating Verant's EULA in that fashion.<br><br>In any event, Verant came to their senses, and no doubt will actually try to modify their client-server protocol to not send everything blindly to the client instead of mauling the privacy rights of their users.

(The complete log is <a href="http://antoniusbayle.tripod.com/smed.txt">here</a>).<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I want to let everyone know we are reconsidering this decision. We're doing an in-game poll tomorrow.<br><br>We do NOT scan people's hard drives. We never have. All we do is check to see if they are running things like WinShowEQ.<br><br>I'm actually surprised about this to tell the truth.. UO has the same thing in their agreement. 5 (e) of their agreement.<br><br>Clearly I underestimated people's reaction to this.<br><br>Lets see what tomorrow brings. I'm reconsidering even putting it in at all.</font><br><br>Later, Brad McQuaid, Everquest's lead designer and Holder of the Vision, and Sony/SCEA's director of legal and business affairs, who drafted the EULA changes were in the same channel. I got the opportunity to fire off a few questions (here's the <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/eqlog1.html">complete log</a> of that session). Sony's lawyer, on as "SonyEsq", had this to say:<br><br><font color="#77FF77"><i>What protections do users have against Verant unilaterally declaring what is "appropriate" for monitoring?</i><br><br>The limitations are twofold. First, the information that is examined is strictly limited to that which is game related. For instance, no one would insist that Verant not examine the EQ directories during its patch routine. Because, if Verant did not peek, then it would have to patch the entire game every time it patches. So, it looks to see what needs updating, and updates.<br><br>Now, secondly, there is a reasonableness standard. The standard of reasonableness is not a subjective one, it is an objective one. That means, (this is gonna sound like a pile of legalese, but I didn't write 200 years of common law). That means that it is what a "reasonable person, acting with knowledge of professionals in the industry, would adjudge as fair."<br><br>So it is Verant's intention, in taking any of these steps, to only do what is necessary and reasonable to protect the integrity of its game.  Certainly, no more.</font><br><br>The poll question is already on the EQ Gameplay board. It reads as follows:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Are you comfortable with the EverQuest client checking to see if you are running programs that are capable of cheating in EverQuest and reporting that back to our servers?</font><br><br>Um, sorry, <b>that's not the issue.</b> Everyone agrees that Verant has a right to defend the integrity of their game against third-party programs; everyone agrees that a more tightly-worded EULA would cause far less of a firestorm. The problem is that, at first glance, Verant is giving themselves the right to determine what is appropriate to examine on your PC. That is the key problem here, and a question that is phrased to elicit a "ooh, cheaters bad" response isn't quite kosher. (To Smedley's credit, in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030461.html">thread</a> he did promise to continue alternate wording.)<br><br>Also, Smedley noted that UO's EULA had the same sort of we-can-snoop-whatever-we-want clause. The clause he refers to is:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">(e) Privacy. You understand that you have no expectation of privacy regarding the communications you make on the Service, and that all communications made by or received from you may be monitored by Origin Systems representatives. You hereby consent to the extraction of hardware system profile data and any data related to operation of the Software through the Service from any computer that logs on to the Service using your Account.</font><br><br>Not quite the same thing. And, as any UOE user over the past two years can tell you, OSI hasn't done any process checking in <b>their</b> client.<br><br>But then again, when you're caught with your hands in the cookie jar, the first impulse is usually to point at someone else.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000211.html">Continue the discussion on Verant's new EULA</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954897375,21381,"></a>

The EULA for EQ is being patched. Some good, some really, really bad.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">In addition to this change, we will also be modifying our User Agreement and Software License to add in some additional Terms and Conditions that we will require everyone to agree to before playing EverQuest.<br><br>The first of these changes concerns the selling of EverQuest Characters and Items outside of the game (i.e. things like Ebay). Here is the text of this change:<br><br>"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material."<br><br>You may ask why we are doing this. There are many reasons, but first and foremost of them is the amount of trouble this is causing our Customer Service group. Simply put there are a lot of people out there who defraud others and we are being put in the middle of it, and we don't have the time or the resources to assist people with these disputes when they arise. The next reason is a more philosophical one and that is that we believe people should have to earn their items and characters in the game rather than from buying them outside the game. Obviously the second point can be argued from other perspectives that we do in fact respect, but we wanted you to hear ours.</font><br><br>So far, so good. Unfortunately, Verant then totally goes for broke:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The next change to the User Agreement and Software license concerns our efforts to stop people from hacking EverQuest and from doing malicious acts that we feel can affect EverQuest as an ongoing business concern. We have developed the technology to check for these hacking tools/programs and report that fact back to us. Without getting into the specifics of this technology, I can say that we in no way will search a user's hard drive(aside from the EverQuest directory during the patching process), registry nor will we send back any information other than the fact that a user is in fact running one of these programs (specifically we are NOT sending information about everything the user is running back to our servers). It's disturbing that the amount of recent developments in the hacking community  force us to do this. Many will say "ShowEQ" isn't worth worrying about. To us, it's cheating and it's not something we can allow in a game like EverQuest where it affects other people's enjoyment of the game. In addition, although this is the first time we'll be acknowledging this, ShowEQ isn't the worst offender. Recently we had someone attempting to bring down our servers with another malicious program. We were able to quickly identify what was going on and insure this didn't happen again, but nonetheless the potential is there and we need to be able to quickly identify and stop these types of programs. Again, I want to say it clearly that we will in NO WAY send any information back to the Everquest servers other than information regarding programs that we feel interfere with the intended operation of EverQuest. We have had this technology available for some time, but recently we've found it's going to be neccessary to go to greater lengths to stop this kind of thing. To those of you concerned about privacy (and rightly so) I want to say that we feel it's neccessary to do this but we want you to be informed that we are going to try these measures to protect both ourselves and the game's players.<br><br>Here is the text of this change:<br><br>"You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files to you.  You also grant us permission to access, extract and upload (i) Game-related data as part of the patching process and (ii) data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable discretion, determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest."<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</font><br><br>So, by the act of playing Everquest, you give Verant permission to nose around your hard drive and download anything they see fit. What's more, they are already doing this. Many folks are reporting that EQ is sending process lists of what is running on a user's PC (such as, say, Visual C++) when it logs on to an EQ server. Now they are giving themselves carte blanche to do <b>much, much more.</b><br><br>OK. Maybe I'm just clueless. Maybe I'm, as someone said before, "blinded by my hostility to Verant". But even if, thanks to draconian laws like <a href="http://archive.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?/features/990531ucita_home.htm">UCITA</a>, this sort of blatant search-and-destroy virus implantation masquerading as an online game is actually legal, that in no way makes it ethical.<br><br>Everquest, more and more, isn't Player vs. Player or Player vs. Monster. <b>It's Player Vs.

Calandryll, the <a href="http://www.shadowcove.com/vigil/hrpuff1.wav">H.R.

What I mean by that is let's say you do not like the design for the faction system. Posting &#8220;I hate the faction system, it sucks!!! - NT&#8221; would not be considered a constructive post. However, posting that you do not like the system and explaining why you don&#8217;t like it, inviting others to post their feelings as well, would be more than acceptable. I do not want these boards to become a place were players feel they cannot express their opinions and I will do my best to make sure everyone has an equal voice, whether they like or dislike the topic being discussed. But I will also not allow them to become a place for flaming and ranting, or where nothing constructive is being said and just scrolling off posts from those who are trying to be constructive.

So, what happens when you build an online game and its main featured character leaves? <br><br>Ultima Online was unique in that it actually had a star - Lord British, the longtime alter ego of Richard Garriott - who planned on appearing in the world on a regular basis. In <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/thesite/0797w4/play/play733jump2_072497.html">Garriott's words</a>:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I actually play the main character, one of the main characters Lord British, and the director of the game is a guy named Starr Long will play a character named Blackthorn, and we're the two primary antagonists in the game that kind of set the stage for the big "save the world" questing activity that takes place within the game. <br><br><i>You have to participate in this game to keep it going?</i><br><br>Absolutely. In fact, to a large degree-- to as much as possible, the game is automated as to how it kind of keeps track of progress and doles out activity to players, but we wanted it to really be as living and breathing and believable a world as possible. And so in this case, both Starr and I will be present as often as possible to kind of keep up the kind of real world believability that we want to be there. <br><br>Richard Garriott and my alter ego, Lord British are so much a part of this game that my work is never done.</font><br><br>Thankfully for Origin's sake, the fate of Ultima Online didn't rest on Garriott and Long appearing ingame on a regular basis. If nothing else, this original vision was doomed by sheer numbers - with 150,000 citizens, personally interacting with even 1% on a regular basis would leave Garriott with little time to do anything else. The ingame fiction proceeded on, and although built around the struggles within British's errant kingdom didn't actually require his presence. (Or Long's, who to our knowledge appeared in character a grand total of twice after UO's beta.) <br><br>Now that Garriott is gone, presumably off to work on worlds non-Ultima in nature, the fate of Britannia's namesake hasn't been really touched on yet. It's time that it was.<br><br>One of the most promising aspects of virtual worlds such as UO is the ability for the world itself to evolve, based on its playerbase. However, to this point, the government of Britannia itself has been locked. Although several attempts had been made to overthrow British's rule in-game, they usually ran square up against the fact that Lord British's continued rule was hard-coded into the game engine. His castle wasn't going anywhere, not even decaying from disuse, and his army consisted of utterly unstoppable Uberguards. Any rebellion was somewhat doomed to futility.<br><br>Until UO:Renaissance, that is. The faction system is derided by those it was supposedly designed for as a bug-ridden exploit-happy poor brother of Order/Chaos townfighting, but the political aspect of factions to this point hasn't been really explored. Here's a perfect opportunity.<br><br>The King is dead. Or gone. Or whatever. The point is that for the first time in UO's history, the supposed government of the shard - the collector of taxes, the commander of guards, the supposed repository of every citizen's loyalty - is up for grabs. This is about as perfect an introduction for a system of political power into UO as it gets. <br><br>For this to work, of course, factions would have to be more meaningful then the latest sop to get PKs to mend their ways. They would have to have <b>actual, meaningful power</b> on their shard. They would have to have the ability to affect those who may not want to be affected (that being what governments do). <br><br>Picture the resolution of the endless stat loss debate being handled at swordpoint. Picture one shard being ruled by iron-fisted tyrants who penalize their citizens for appearing improperly dressed. Another shard where rules are set at a whim, ruled by robber-barons out to exploit their victims - er we mean citizens - for as much as possible. And still another shard where those who stand for justice and honor still try to hold the line, in the memory of their departed soveriegn.<br><br>Picture a world where players matter. It can happen.<br><br>Assuming that Origin has the courage to give the shards back to their players. And, even more frightening, the courage to challenge their own icons.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000208.html">We shall speak of this again, you and I.</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954776340,4714,"></a>

After rounds of heated exchanges over last nights and me getting pissed off and the GM I spoke with having a stick the size of a redwood tree up his ass, all of my accounts (except one that OSI doesnt know about but thats more or less irrelevant at this point) are not going to be reactivated at any time in UO unless my final appeal to the head of all head GMs goes through today which I doubt BUT I am trying. All AD houses that I owned on those accounts will decay and everything in them lost or dropped to the ground. In a few days its going to be a field day on AD for picking up rare items and tons of loot.<br><br>I thought for sure this incident would be resolved 2 days ago because, quite frnakly, its stupid that it escalated to this. Unfortunatley OSI is known for its stupidity and things have gone completely to hell. Lord British was fired or quit OSI I am told (although i havent read an official press release on this yet). 20+ head GMs and programmers are fired or quit. OSIs old guard is gone and new structures are being put in place as we speak. Its a very long and very confusing story but here it is, in a somewhat abbreviated form to make some parts clearer:<br><br>As you know one of the accounts I pay for on my credit card is an elder/seer account. That account did so well in the role that it was up for promotion to head guy on Atlantic or one of the top 3 head guys. I didnt realize it was being considered for the role until a GM asked that char to meet him to talk about the role. During the meeting, as the talk went on, he looked at the account to ensure it was in OSI compliance he also reviewed the sterling track record on the account for superb performance (hence why it was being considered).<br><br>At that time he found a discrepancy. That discrepancy was that there was a troubador character (a play actor char with no powers but that could be changed in form by a GM for events at their discretion) on a second account that is also paid for by the same credit card. He immediately questioned this.  Although it is not written in any agreements that this is a problem, OSI rules are mostly unwritten and made up by the GM on the scene. They allow this because of a clause in every contract every play agrees to when they join UO saying that A) the terms of the contract are subject to change without notice and in whatever way they wish and B) they can ban you for any reason they feel like or no reason at all and you agree to that by playing UO. Nice fine print.<br><br>Anyway, so he questioned that char. It was explained to the GM that the char was created back in early February BY A GM for a GM EVENT and with the KNOWLEDGE of the GM who did it. They needed several "actors" to play parts in the attack on Vesper that night AND they needed elder/seer chars to spawn monsters. Only 2 volunteers were on. The shard lead and the account on my card so they both spawned and since I have dual UO, the account on my credit card play acted as well.<br><br>The GM thought about this a second and said he needed to "think some". What is there to think about it was asked? This is cut and dry. You can see, tagged to the chars name, the name of the GM and the date which it was created. Its all pretty cut and dry and if anyone is at fault for doing this, the GM who created the char should never have allowed it. You cant hide anything from a GM so it was obvious to him what he was creating and where and for what reasons. A player cant do it themselves hence this is a complete non-issue. It is the GMs fault. This is not the same GM that was at the meeting but rather the OLD GM in charge of the program who has sinced moved on or been fired. OSI changes GMs and they quit/get fired and go to other companies or other projects all the time. Well, I continued to voice concern and displeasure. Although I didnt get abusive or profane in anyway, I did state it wasnt my fault and was theirs.<br><br>Well this didnt go over well and the dicussion turned somewhat heated. He did a quick search and turned up a list of all accounts by that credit card and banned them all saying "he was going to have to think about things" and decide if bad things went on here and he was going to have to permanently ban them or if he would just ban some or if he would ban none. It even got juvenile at that point with the GM stating things like "I see you have an invalid phone number of this<br>account! Thats grounds for banning!" "Aha! I see you have a bad email na@na.com on this account. Thats grounds for banning!". I went into a story to explain things in an effort to mitigate his issues and explain the rules as they are written and to explain why this wasnt right.<br><br>The entire conversation went from 'You are kicking ass and helping the program immensely, so much so we are going to promote you.' to 'We see a discrepancy between the 2 accounts and we arent sure if it was caused by us even though we are the only ones who can make volunteer chars and we have to physically show up in game, come to your char and do it to make it happen' to 'I dont like having my authority questioned im banning everything until further review' to 'Lets get childish here and say that your invalid phone number and email are also grounds for the banning' to 'Ill get back to you after I think about all of this'<br><br>A day passed with no change and no replies to emails. Another day passed with no change and no replies to emails. Late last night, all accounts were permanently banned. And many of you emailed me saying all houses on those accounts are locked which means they will decay in a few days and that cannot be prevented.<br><br>OSI informed me that the banning is permant and irrevocable and they state: "You, and anyone you authorize to use your Account and User ID on the Service, agree to follow the Rules of Conduct published by Origin Systems. The Rules of Conduct may be found on the Web Site. The Rules of Conduct may change at Origin Systems discretion, at any time. Origin Systems reserves the right to terminate your Membership if it determines in its sole discretion that you have engaged in any impermissible conduct whether or not such conduct violates the Rules of Conduct."<br><br>In other words, we can ban you for ANYTHING we want at ANY time regardless of whether it is made up, or an actual written rule or something we amended the rules to or whatever. We can do it and because you clicked "I agree" when you formed your account you grant us the legal authority to do this.<br><br>In addition they said:  "this decision is not subject to appeal at this point"<br><br>In short, what began as an attempt to promote a character on one of the accounts paid for by my credit card, became a witch hunt because of a GM (who I believe if now fired or has moved on ) making the mistake of allowing a second char to support an OSI EVENT to be created on a side account. Despite that fact that NO bad conduct was recorded or reported and in fact conduct was SOOOOO good that OSI was going to promote that account, all accounts were locked down pending that GM thinking about it. Then to make things just stupid, other comments were made about bad emails and phone numbers as violations and grounds for termination. Then all contact was severed and all<br>accounts banned and all avenues for appeal promptly terminated.<br><br>Ive got OSIs terms of service (current ones) Printed and listed in front of me. In those I see no infractions that were done by me that are listed. However I clearly see the rule that says they can change the TOS without notice to be whatever they want it to be and they can ban for any reason they wish and that we, as players, agree to this. I now understand why all past lawsuits against OSI have failed because<br>every player who enters UO gives up every right including the right to play the game itself by the rules set out when they joined since OSI can ban them at any time for any reason which is why they can ban people for saying "OSI sucks" or "This Game Sucks".<br><br>So what does this mean to the guild in terms of UO? Well, it effectively ends our time in UO as a guild. All AD major AD houses are going to decay. What will be left will be 10 or so small houses. All guild houses off AD are going to decay. What will be left will be 2 small houses I have on a secret account and 5 chars that are a friends/members whos account I watch over. Im not sure if the LLTS stone will decay or simply be locked down. If it is simply locked down then members can remain on it as long as they wish to, but we cannot add new members. Same with the TSG stone. The TS* stone might be reachable from the KoTD front porch if they didnt lock the front doors and could be moved and used as it has 45 wars on it.<br><br>But for all intents and purposes, The Syndicate in UO was just destroyed by OSI. As GM I accept full responsibility and full expect half of you to decide you hate me and quit the Syndicate as a guild. The guilds main gaming focus will shift to Everquest now and planning will begin for another game to replace UO like Anarchy online or Horizons or something in the future. At this point the prospect of rebuilding in UO with SOOOOOOOO much lost by SOOOOOO many people because of the fickle nature of OSI seems a waste of effort. As players in UO, we have 0 rights. None. Not even one. We play the game at OSIs discretion and can be removed whenever they wish for whatever reason they wish. And we all agreed to this when we setup our accounts so we have no legal basis for an appeal. We even agreed to give up any refund of our money if we did get banned for whatever reason OSI agreed to even if the billing period was up. In short, OSI has every player by the balls (so to speak) and can rule the world in whatever manner they deem appropriate.<br><br>I am sick to my stomach with OSI. I am sick to think that a world, within a world, that we built in UO together and far more successful than any other world, has no meaning and no lasting power beyond what we are given by the grace of OSI. I cannot even put into words how upset I am at them and at the situation.<br><br>In closing you may ask yourself, HOW could this happen? What is going on at OSI? Well OSI SUCKS right now! They have undergone MASSIVE restructuring that all happened in just the past couple weeks. Lord British is NO LONGER with them. ALL the IMPORTANT GMs you may have known, are GONE. 20+ GMs and programmers were FIRED. The RUMOR is that Lord British got fired although its more likely he quit because when you have his cash it just doesnt matter and you dont have to put up with higher management crap. Peoples accounts (volunteers and players) are getting suspended without being told why. And their communications have being 10x worse than before (and you thought they were bad before). This explains why I am not getting a response from any of the GMs I used to know who were in positions of power. All are all fired or quit. Several members are also part of the volunteer program and passed along some of that information to me. Some of it is common knowledge. In short, things look REAL bad at OSI as a company right now.<br><br>It SUCKS that it spilled over to us and this CRAP was pulled on us. <br><br>Now the obvious questions at this point are:<br><br>What are my plans for The Syndicate? The Syndicate, the guild, is not going anywhere. It has existed 4 years and will exist MANY more. Our primary game focus is now Everquest and that is where I will be spending all of my gaming time right now. We will be exploring OTHER games to possibly go into like maybe Anarchy online, UO2, Horizons or any of the half dozen others due out this year or early next year.<br><br>The Syndicate, doesnt exist within one game. It transcends games. Our UO presence has been snuffed out by OSI officially. I realize some/many/afew members will continue to play UO and thats great! For the time being you can all continue to stay on the LLTS guildstone and maintain The Syndicate name in UO. If that decays or if OSI locks it down, we will put up a side stone for you to work from so long as you want to play. We will not be accepting new members and Arx Draconis as a town is over. Those of you with deeds are more than welcome to place personal houses there when the guild ones decay. Customers may still come there so you can put up vendors and such. Our Team of Friends, will continue to exist in UO but our official guild has been snuffed out by OSI and everything we worked for as a team has been destroyed. I will now focus my energies on making our OTHER game world successful and in opening new doors for the guild. Should you chose to remain a part of us for those worlds, I welcome you!! Should you chose to quit and go your own way, I shake your hand in friendship and wish you good journey.<br><br>I couldnt care less about my chars in UO. My only care is about the guild so I am immensely upset that OSI, in their current corporate state of not caring, has done this to us. I am very upset that they just DONT CARE about any of you as players or about what our guild (or any guild) offers to the world. I am very upset that they basically SUCK at all things customer service and are killing this game. I am sorry to all of you that this happened to <br><br>We have one FINAL appeal in place where I am contacting the highest levels (assuming they arent fired as well) of OSI support as well as the head admin guy (who is still there) in an effort to resolve this correctly. I will inform you the SECOND I hear anything. But assuming OSI continues on its current path of not caring the results will be negative. No one do anything too rash though for 24 hours. And remember, you can remain on the LLTS stone for as long as OSI doesnt lock it and kick you off.<br><br>                        Long Live The Syndicate<br>                        -Dragons-</font><br><br>Well, if this is indeed true sounds like one GM antagonized a whole bunch of folks. Or, looking at it from the other side, one guildmaster tossed his entire guild of 250+ people into the dumpster.<br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000207.html"><b>What's the real story here?</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954772323,84797,"></a>

Fully expanded, our skill trees are large enough and numerous enough to wallpaper a room - I know this because Mobius has done so. Each skill tree has numerous branches, which offer different sub abilities. Some skill trees are quite large (the combat one currently has 150+ skills in it), whereas others are quite small (there are two skill trees that only have two boxes in them). We're talking a lot of freakin' skills here.<br><br>It is difficult enough to simply implement all of the ways that these skills can function, advance, and interact. Ensuring that each skill can only advance on use of that skill quickly becomes a technical infeasibility, a data storage monstrosity and a design nightmare. It also becomes difficult to add new things, and hard to balance. Given the options, we had a couple of choices: <br><br>* Reduce the number of cool skills that players can learn and perform, but allow them to advance only by doing them.<br><br>* Put in a simple-to-use, hard-to-exploit advancement system, and then put in a ton of freakin' skills.<br><br>Now then, if you ask me what makes for a better game, a more immersive world, and a more complete community, it is one that offers more skills and ways to grow and expand those skills, and by extension, greater character customization<br><br><I>The only good thing I see out of such a system is that it encourages combat.</I> <br><br>Incorrect.
