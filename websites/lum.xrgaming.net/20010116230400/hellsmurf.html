        OF THE HELL SMURFS</font></b></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been getting more mail 

        than you can believe from the &quot;Major Kyra and the Smurf Army&quot; 

        series of stories. Almost as much as the GM Darwin escapade. This is scary. 

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of you pointed out that 

        the C/SRC/SLC program has been undergoing major reforms, and old-schoolers 

        like me who have fond memories of kewld3ewd smurfs scouting ahead for 

        their buds during guildwars is definitely ancient history. Apparently 

        (and this is a novel concept, I must admit) those counselors who still 

        are around actually answer player questions on a regular basis.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many others pointed out that 

        Cs also have the power to teleport people around.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One particularly knowledgable 

        correspondent who asked to remain anonymous explained exactly how he was 

        using his position to reform what he could, and remained as seperate from 

        the GMs and politics as possible, and in general made me feel like a weasel.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kyra wrote my wife asking her 

        to get me to shut up, though, which made me feel better.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This has been a longstanding 

        problem, as evidenced by a letter on the subject I published <a href="paula.html">months 

        ago</a>. Basically, the smurfs have one hell of an image problem. (They 

        know this, which I think is why they email-bombed me en masse last night.) 

        Many are doing their best to combat this. Others couldn't give a crap, 

        and spend all their time in IRC. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it appears to me that 

        they are trying. And given the number of folks who are out there in positions 

        of something approaching responsibility (1 SLC per shard, multiple SRCs 

        per shard), there really have not been that many accounts of abuse of 

        authority that have reached my ears. Some, but not many.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another thing to consider is 

        that many of the most virulent rumors are started by counselors who have 

        fallen short of the glory of smurfdom and were derobed. They have consequent 

        axes to grind. I like to think I usually do a pretty good job of taking 

        this into account.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it looks like I got one 

        wrong. Not all SRCs/SLCs are useless ass-kissing politicians. Just some. 

        And the sooner they are purged from the system, the better.</font></p>

      <blockquote>

          violated by having these things publicly accessible, you should probably 

          not have them publicly accessible. Obviously I can't take them down

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know you don't want to 

          hear this, and it may be true in the case of SOME SRC's, but mine isn't 

          much of a buttkisser. The reason why they (notice my vagueness in reference 

          to gender :P) are an SRC is because they put in CRAZY hours. She (OK, 

          I don't feel like typing he/she or they anymore :) ) is on like at LEAST 

          12 hours a day (scary, I know...and 12 hours is the minimum, too). Also, 

          she has printouts of maps, URLS, and damn near everything Stratics has 

          ever posted printed up at her fingertips. Does she have a life? I don't 

          know, but when she is on UO she's damn good. I put in MAYBE 15 hours 

          a week, she clocks over 80 as an SRC easily. Is she an asskisser? I 

          doubt it, but even if she is, she's still an excellent counselor. 'Nuff 

          said. </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK. I think we've seen enough 

        on this subject now. Basically, some SRCs are good, and some SRCs are 

        bad. And if you are an SRC and reading this, you probably think you're 

        in the former category. I would rather this page not suddenly turn into 

        the Bitch About Your Boss page, though, so let's try to keep the horror 

        stories to those that actually affect normal players and not the ever-swirling 

        office politics that surrounds jobs that people don't technically get 

        paid for.</font></p>

        Get laid. SOMEthing.) have pointed out, this is bullshit. Siege Perilous 

        was intended to be an expert shard, but not an experiment in the basic 

        fundamentals of combat (INT modifiers for warriors? DEX modifiers for 

        mages? Hey, Muffy, let's penalize folks who optimize their characters! 

        It'd be fun!), where the underlying rules are never spelled out, but can 

        only be fathomed by trial and error. If massive changes are to be made

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> And if somehow letting

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) From what I have heard 

        of the SRCs, the position is gained by firmly applying one's lips to the 

        ass of a given GM, and their duties, when not interfering with other characters 

        who may or may not be macroing (as the SRC in question, using a regular-issue 

        client, has no idea whatsoever), mainly constitute sitting around in IRC 

        and, when not continuing to apply lips to the ass of a given GM, lord 

        their godly powers over the lesser, not quite as privileged smurfs, who 

        are actually tasked with the bothersome task of dealing with players. 

        This is not the type of person whom I think power trips such as magical 

        mysterious teleporting lightning storms should be entrusted to. It's just 

        not something I would recommend in their mental state.</font></p>

        THE HELL SMURFS</font></b></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*Very* interesting letter just 

        came in. I can't say I agree with this correspondent's enthusiasm about 

        OSI's &quot;solution&quot;. The possibility for abuse staggers the imagination.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your comments, and any confirmation 

        on what Riff Raff witnessed, are encouraged.</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ok, I discovered something 

          last night while playing on Siege Perilous that in my mind answers all 

          questions about the future of SP, wipe or no-wipe, and the new anti-macro 

          measures that are going in this weekend. Now some of this is speculation 

          but if you look at all the facts, it makes a lot of sense.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So this week has been kind 

          of a roaller-coaster ride of emotion, lots of rumours, and quite a lot 

          of changes to the awesome new Shard we've been playing. For many it's 

          felt like a new breath of fresh air for UO, it's "how UO was supposed 

          to be." For others it's been a nightmare, for such things as being banned 

          for going to the bathroom, being afk, and many other stores we heard 

          about GM Abuse. And lately there has been a lot of discussion of wipe 

          or no wipe for the shard.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The post from the OGD member 

          basically summed up why a wipe should not occur, and it was dead-on. 

          The players and OSI agreed that this was a test shard, and that it would 

          be wiped ONLY in the event of a major unbalancing bug, on the magnitude 

          of a gold dupe. Players like the ones in OGD who busted ass all week 

          to succeded in the new shard with the added level of difficulty were 

          going off the assumption that the deal would be kept by OSI, and that 

          this wasn't just a "bust all the macroers and find their exploits" experiment. 

          I am included into the group of people who sacrificed sleep and all 

          spare time to satisfy my addiction to this new shard and to try and 

          get the best possible start I could. All this talk of a possible wipe 

          at the end of this 10 day marathon has made me upset as well, as that 

          wasn't the deal, and all it did was punish the ones who played by the 

          rules (no unattended macroing!), tried their hardest, and pulled no 

          punches in building their characters and the economy of this brand new, 

          and IMHO, most exciting shard to ever start up.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now you have people like 

          Myschyf whining to you and all over the message boards about how a wipe 

          is needed. Now I call them whiners because they are trying to get OSI 

          to change the deal. Well sorry, it wasn't "At the end of the week we'll 

          hold a poll to help determine weither or not to wipe the shard". We 

          could look at the people who are pro-wipe and try and figure out where 

          they are coming from, read their complains, and still find no valid 

          reason. Invalid reasons that come to mind: They were banned 48 hrs for 

          macroing unattended like fools on the first day and "want a chance to 

          catch up". They made a mistake on the skills they picked with their 

          starting character, and were planning on starting over anyways, so why 

          shouldn't everyone else <- lots of people in this category. And then 

          there are those who were afraid of a possible wipe, did not want to 

          invest time and effort into building characters or weath, and decide 

          that if they can whine loud enuf like they have on other shards, OSI 

          will wipe the shard to appease the masses. Then on Wednesday we get 

          this funky mana/stamina depletion when using skills, and every single 

          person in the game complains. And more pro-wipers are formed as all 

          the sudden "anyone who got skills before that rule has a major advantage".. 

          ok so they took it out 24 hrs later, and nobody's hurt one way or another.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So now everyone is unsure 

          of whats going on. Do we spend more time and effort and build on what 

          we accomplished up til now? Well for me, it seemed that a wipe was highly 

          dependant on the "new solution to macroing" targeted for this weekend. 

          It seemed obvious, that if it was anything like what we saw on wednesday, 

          there would be nobody happy who didn't have a decent character already, 

          as now it would be harder than before to build skills.. and therefore 

          create an imbalance. So that left the people like myself and OGD who 

          worked their tail off playing as hard as they could the last week wondering 

          if it was all in vain and what possible solution could satisfy everyone's 

          needs. 1:30am PST last night it all came together.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was practicing healing 

          in the Vesper Jewlry shop when I got an ICQ about a SRC showing up at 

          the Vesper Bank. The message basically described how the purple-robed 

          SRC Wysp showed up, dragging a macrower behind. Everyone crowded around 

          and started talking to him, and all of the sudden a lightning bolt came 

          down from the sky, blasting the macroer and kicking him from the server. 

          (Friend who ICQ'd me started asking "when did SRCs get this power?" 

          A few seconds later, to my surprise, SRC Wysp appeared next to me and 

          my healing partner. he (she?) said "Are you guys there?" .. we responded 

          that we were.. and then the counselor said "ok, thanks, have fun!" and 

          dissappeared. Then the gears started turning... 9am delayed maintenance 

          for Siege Perilous, a SRC showing GM-like powers that were talked about 

          in a "top secret report on Dr. Twister's site" that had been long forgotten, 

          and a "macro solution that was planned for implimentation this weekend".</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have you figured it out yet? 

          SRC's (and maybe lesser counselors) are going to be the macro police. 

          There are certainly more of them than GM's and, with their increased 

          powers, can hand out justice to those who break the rules, and keep 

          everyone honest. Wow this was one of those ideas that actually made 

          a ton of sense! This certainly doesn't change the game balance, skills 

          you could macro are not any more difficult after this "solution". And 

          NO WIPE has to occur of all the people who put in tons of time and effort 

          hoping that OSI would keep their word and not punish us for actually 

          trying, and playing by the rules! The delayed 9am maintenance may have 

          had something to do with this as well, to teach counselors how to use 

          their new powers, or it could have nothing at all to do with it, doesn't 

          really matter. But this, IMHO, is an incredibly smart answer to the 

          macro "problem". </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I can already hear it. 

          "I dont trust countslors, they'll just help out their friends on the 

          shard". Well sometimes you are going to have to trust the cops... I 

          think the likelihood of them using these powers to ban/kick people to 

          help their friends is remote. And it certainl beats any rediculous changes 

          that affect gameplay or skill advancement such as the ones implemented 

          on Wednesday (and quickly removed at the next maintenance). I for one 

          am willing to trust these guys to do their "job" as macro-police. They 

          certainly couldn't do any worse than some of the GM's have earlier this 

          week.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This may be a new age for 

          Ultima Players as we know it. Siege Perilous is by far the best shard 

          to ever come out. When you hear about how much fun it is, and how it's 

          "bringing players out of retirement", it's true. And it's not surprising 

          that there has been so much emotion invovled in the discussions. People 

          who worked hard, played by the rules, adapted, cooperated, did whatever 

          it took to excel, don't want a wipe, as they would be ripped off of 

          their time and that wasn't part of the deal. People who cheated and 

          got banned, didn't make as much of an effort, or just are upset because 

          some people are "ahead" or accomplished stuff like OGD, think they can 

          "whine" their way to a wipe and excuse it as "it's only 2 weeks, we've 

          played other chars on shards for 2 years.. whats the big deal?". Well, 

          it is a big deal to us. And this solution is the best step towards getting 

          past this wipe/no wipe issue and getting on with playing the game. When 

          groups of 20 noto a grey for looting his fallen friend, the good guys 

          have to step up. We're ready. Thanks Runesabre, for hopefully not letting 

          the whiners ruin this shard like, many beleive, the other shards have 

          been. Thanks for keeping your part of the deal. As you can already see 

          in the first week of play, it's worth it.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Test Guild was disbanded 

          a couple weeks back. This current issue with all of the old Test Guild 

          officers getting GM-buffed level 50 characters has nothing to do with

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Frankly, the guild was worthless

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now as for the ex-TG officers

          to the favoritism from GMs. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I suspect that this was a 

          contributing factor to the disbanding of the guild, in fact. Possibly 

          the officers abandoned the guild so they could get buffed in secret 

          and have their own little "l33t" club.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">What do I think? Well, 

        I can see Verant needing high level players to test new places to keep 

        sooper-high level twinks like FoH happy. That is why Verant has QA testers. 

        Seeing <a href="http://www.mwcyber.com/forums/towboard/messages/9577.html">this

        telling me, these &quot;elite testers&quot; aren't selflessly testing 

        new zones for bugs (an incredibly monotonous and boring job if done right; 

        ask any programmer) but... camping high level zones for cool stuff. Can't 

        test the server right if I don't got journeyman boots! And EQ GMs tweaking

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since this isn't a board 

          here's my rebuttal to OGD's whine. I'm surprised you fell for it. Sympathy 

          ploys don't seem to be quite your style. When you play the game 'hard' 

          and take up all the escorts on the shard 24-7 (and OGD did just this) 

          you have to expect others to be unhappy with it. Sure what they did 

          is completely within the rules of the game. Sure they didn't use a faucet. 

          Sure -- first come, first served. But when you do something like that 

          and grab a monopoly on the escorts it would be silly not to expect other 

          folks to be a bit 'put out'. It doesn't look equal -- it doesn't look 

          fair. (It doesn't matter whether it actually IS equal and fair - appearances 

          are everything dontcha know).</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So they wipe the shard and 

          OGD loses everything. Big fuckin deal. It isn't like they can't do what 

          they did before. If they are so kewl and together and legit it should 

          be that hard to do it all over again. If they aren't -- too bad. Maybe 

          then OSI is right to wipe.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In either case its just a 

          whine like any other whine. Its just two weeks of work. Everyone over 

          there is putting aside the years of work that they put in on their other 

          characters. Two weeks seems pretty minor to me in comparison.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the debate on whether or 

        not to wipe Siege Perilous rages, within and without Origin, the OGD guild 

        has been one of the loudest voices in insisting that a wipe not take place. 

        This makes sense to me; they absolutely tore up the shard, and under very 

        difficult circumstances did what no guild, including my own, could do, 

        and that was get a house and guildstone placed. Here's some words from 

        another OGD player, which I must admit are fairly persuasive. I was convinced 

        a shard wipe had to happen for the sake of balance; now I'm not as convinced.</font></p>

          that a) they do not want to wipe, and would do so only upon the appearance

          in the event of a wipe. <br>

          are supposed to be gold faucets in this game. So long as they're not 

          cheese like fancy shirt sewing, I don't see how you can complain). First 

          step, a boat. After many hours of monster bashing and NPC escorting 

          (2 full days), we find we have a boat. You know that giddy feeling you 

          get when you've worked hard for something and can finally buy it? I 

          think we all felt that very strongly as we saw our boat appear on the 

          shore of Skara Brae. It was a happy bunch that rode off to Deceit that

          us to hit Deceit on an almost 24 hour basis which allowed us to rake

        screw with macroing (and you know that was the point of all this) what 

        they could do is take the already existing code that penalizes you for 

        doing multiple actions in the same place without moving and jack it up 

        so that, say, doing something three times or more in a row in the same 

        tile results in zero skill gain. Maybe even a cute message comes up -- 

        &quot;You become bored out of your mind from the repetition&quot; or some 

        such. That would effectively nuke macroing without penalizing those who 

        actually use skills.</font></p>

        Test Center regular appears to have severely <a href="http://www.mwcyber.com/forums/towboard/messages/9304.html">ruffled 

        some feathers</a>.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note to self: turn in my press 

        corps ID ASAP, since I've been outed as &quot;journalism at it's worst&quot;,

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I feel sorry for you if you 

        blindly believe everything you read here. Or Dr. Twister's. Or CNN. I 

        feel even more sorry for you if you are one of the folks that I actually 

        have to explain this to. I'm not sure if it's because American schools 

        have basically become nothing more than testbeds for new varieties of 

        Ritalin, because we all sinned and fell short of the glory of God/Allah/Vishnu/Buddha/J'h'v'h/Ahriman/Amaterasu/my 

        left nut, or simply because, in the opinion of one of the few people whose 

        opinions I actually respect and listen to, the world just needs a cold 

        reboot. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, if you actually 

        trudge through this entire thread and the <a href="http://www.mwcyber.com/forums/towboard/messages/9382.html">one

        the &quot;Test Guild&quot; or whatever cool name the club has this week 

        are a pack of insular and defensive folks with really thin skins and a 

        taste for retribution, who are far too proud of being &quot;on the inside&quot; 

        with whatever dev team they are on the inside with this month. Um, kind 

        of like what the letter I printed claimed. Wow. These coincidences, they 

        make my head hurt. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* I was not a TC "regular". 

          In fact, the only reason I made contact with the "regs" of Dein Cathair 

          fame was that I took on the task of UOSS reporter for that shard. I 

          never took the stance of being a "reg", even after becoming very good 

          friends with a number of the folks people scream are "favored"; to this 

          day I find this debate a little pointless... </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* I don't want "in" the Beta 

          Test Server program. I was being facetious....and VERY sarcastic. As 

          quoted by PD Faceless, during one of our "discussions" on GT, "You've 

          severed all your ties with OSI, Senith." Meaning, I don't have a chance 

          in hell...*smiles* </font></p>
