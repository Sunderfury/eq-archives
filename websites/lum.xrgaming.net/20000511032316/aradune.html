with Brad &quot;Aradune&quot; McQuaid</font></b><br>
<b>Vice President of Development, Verant Interactive</b><br>
<i><font size="2">(4/11/00) Brad McQuaid was the main architect behind
Everquest, which currently has over 200,000 subscribers, making it the most
popular massively multiplayer online game on the Internet. In addition to
fine-tuning Everquest, he is the executive producer for Verant's newest game in
development, the highly anticipated Star Wars Online.</font></i></font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&lt;Lum&gt; What's your current role in
Everquest?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; I am VP of development at Verant and Executive Producer of all
EQ related titles, current and future.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; How much of a hand did you have in creating the new expansion?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; I was technically the producer for most of it and worked
extensively with the Kunark team and other EQ people who were involved.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; What sort of enhancements can we expect in the expansion, other then
the graphics?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Other than the new playable race and enhanced graphics, I think
players will find a more mature and learned approach to zone design, both in
terms of the zone's layout and the content of the zones (NPCs, treasure, etc.)<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Do you think the new zones are less &quot;campable&quot; then the
zones we've seen so far in EQ? (and is &quot;campable&quot; a word?)<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; More so yes, but we certainly haven't 'fixed' camping per se,
and I'm not sure we ever will totally with the current incarnation of EQ. We are
using more 'randomized' loot and many dungeons require players to commit to them
more so than older dungeons. Also, we're hoping there will simply be less
crowding and therefore less competition for camp sites. So, overall, I think
things will be a lot better, but people will still camp something they really
want<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Do lower level characters have a reason to travel to the new zones?
Is the new continent mainly a place for higher levels?<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; (Yes, I'm throwing you easy pitches to start.)<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; (heh) I'm glad you asked, because I think some people assume
perhaps that the Expansion is only for higher level players looking for more
content, and that simply isn't the case. There is plenty of content for all
level ranges in Kunark, and, for example, just as many mid-level zones as there
are high level.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; About those higher levels, one of the features of the expansion most
anticipated by the EQ fanatic is the ability to get to level 60 from the current
level 50 cap<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; True...<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; We can pretty safely assume that spell casters will get new spells;
what about melee characters? What will they get in new skills past level 50?
Will they get higher skill caps in general, or are new skills available?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; The pure melee classes get new skills of a sort -- they're
called disciplines. The casters and hybrid classes get new spells. All classes
have many of their level caps for the skills they already have raised.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Do any of those new skill caps go higher than 255?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; No, none of the skill caps exceed 250 or so.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Can you go into more detail about disciplines? How are they
different from the current EQ skill system?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Disciplines are quite different, and currently being tuned on
Test extensively, so I can't go into any more detail as to how they work at this
point, sorry.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Are disciplines only limited to characters over level 50?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Yes, you don't receive any disciplines until post 50.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; We've heard a lot from you guys about something called &quot;The
Vision(tm)&quot;. Can you go into some detail about this vision thing? Is the
Vision really trademarked?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Heh, no, I think a player started adding TM whenever he used the
term and it caught on. I thought it was pretty funny so I started using it
myself. The Vision(TM) is really, in a nutshell, what we (the EQ teams) always
have wanted EQ to be... When we sat down and designed EQ years ago we all had a
vision in mind, and it really came together. Basically, we wanted to bring MUDs
to the masses, attach graphics to them, and also to recreate that feeling of
playing D&amp;D or some such with your friends around the table, but online and
in a 3D world.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Do players have any voice in what goes into The Vision(tm)?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Yes, players definitely have a voice in what goes into the
Vision -- we get a ton of great suggestions for our player base on things to
change, adjust, add, delete, etc. And this feedback is very important to us, and
have definitely made EQ a better game. That said, EQ isn't for everyone (nor
could it be) and there are a few players who at times want fundamental changes
made to EQ. When that happens is usually when there is some perceived conflict
between the Vision(TM) and the 'players', although, of course, with so many
players we have all sorts of opinions, often conflicting.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; What sort of features have you implemented as a result of player
feedback?<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; You haven't given my necromancer a Fiery Avenger yet, for one thing.<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; That could very easily be part of my Vision(tm).<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; A few of the features we've received from player feedback are:
the friends list, dueling, DOT messages, the loot message, etc.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; I *really* like the DOT messages BTW<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Do you check in on class-specific web sites, message board, etc. to
see what they are complaining about?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Definitely. Abashi, I, and several other team members read all
sorts of boards, the big ones and the small ones. For example, I know that GZ
reads eqcasters. I often read the Dojo and the Safehouse. We do our best to find
great feedback from as many sources as we have time to investigate.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Do you think you have a good handle on &quot;class politics?&quot;
That's kind of hard to define I know... basically how classes &quot;sell&quot;
themselves for groups... Clerics have a hard time selling themselves before they
get Superior Healing for example. Before then most groups would rather have
druids... after that it reverses.<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; A pretty good handle on 'class politics', yes. We try to read
people's issues about class balance and such because every once in a while we
find that there really is something that needs adjusting.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; I'm trying to avoid specific &quot;class issues&quot; here but
there's one thing I just have to ask, if only because it seeming contrasts with
&quot;The Vision(tm)&quot;&nbsp; EQ has done an overall good job of controlling
grief players, and has tried to continue refining that with such things as
showing what players are looting, the &quot;Play Nice&quot; policy of camp
policing, etc. Given that, why do rogues have a pick pocket skill that basically
steals money from fellow group members?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Part of the challenge we wanted Rogues to encounter is the trust
issue. Rogues, traditionally, are not very nice fellows and don't get along with
others, except perhaps other Rogues. EQ, though, is a social game, based on
interdependence in many ways. So Rogues by design have more of a challenge
grouping as well as with other aspects of the game (faction issues, and such). I
guess to me, that question would be akin to asking 'why do so many NPCs hate
Trolls?'<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Sure, but Trolls expect NPCs to hate them... it doesn't really stop
them from playing. If a rogue can't group, he pretty much can't play... it's
hard to backstab a creature when you're the only one fighting it!<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; It does restrict them in some capacity and presents more of a
challenge to play. So does the trust issue that Rogues have to overcome with
their fellow players.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Well you read the Safehouse, I'm sure they put it more eloquently
than I could (I don't play a rogue)... it just strikes me as odd given the other
pvp restrictions. Anyway.<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; I assume except for the tuning work you mentioned earlier the
expansion is pretty much out the door... any plans yet for what's next in EQ?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; That is true -- we are heavily tuning now and will continue
after release when large groups of players beginning to explore Kunark. The
immediate post Kunark plans that I can talk about are as follows: re-tuning
older less used dungeons (Najena, Mistmoore, Permafrost) and also adding some
new zones (the Hole, the Warrens). We also will be revamping Poison and probably
Tinkering to an extent after that. (btw, the Warrens is a Lum Exclusive(TM) )</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&lt;Lum&gt; w00t! w00t!<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; is that another Odus zone?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Yes.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Those darn Erudites. They get all the cool zones.<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; More Gnome Zones!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">* Aradune grins.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Actually, the Odus bit is another example of listening to our
customers' input -- we saw a lot of posts and received a lot of feedback asking
for more zones in Odus before we fleshed out the other continents.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Are there any plans for more dynamic quests in the game?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; We have big plans for more dynamic quests and events, and are
brining more GMs on to the quest team in the near future.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Will we see quests that don't involve &quot;Everyone dies&quot; in
the plot line? I've seen some screenshots of quest aftermaths that are just...
ugly. Zone floors papered with corpses.<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Unfortunately, many of the dynamic events that are reported or
screenshotted are the more combat oriented ones, often with the corpses and such
strewn across the landscape. But there have been and will continue to be
different types of events, many that don't involve combat at all.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Can you go into more detail on that, without spoiling them
completely? Any plans on making faction standing more meaningful then &quot;who
won't kill me&quot; for example...<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Factions are more linked to how NPCs react to players than how
GM run players react to each other. I'd love to see the faction system
broadened, but we don't have any short term plans to do so. Examples of
non-combat GM events should be apparent fairly soon, because there will be a
storyline revealed immediately prior to launching Kunark (I think it may have
already started)<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Let's touch on EQ's economy for a bit. Are you happy with the
current state of EQ's player economy? I know you've recently introduced some
gold sinks for high level players... I even saw a ykesha auctioned for plat the
other day.<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; I'm feeling pretty good about the economy. For a while there was
indeed a problem with high level players having more plat than they knew what to
do with, which made it such that high level items were only traded and not
bought/sold, which is a bad thing(TM). The money sinks have definitely helped
reduce platinum in circulation at the higher levels.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Are there any plans in the works to enhance trade skills or add new
ones? I know you mentioned tinkering earlier.<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Definitely. I can't get too specific beyond Poison and
Tinkering, but the way the trade skill system works in EQ (where is is more
ancillary as opposed to integral) it needs to be almost constantly updated to
remain viable and attractive.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Will any expansion zones see &quot;entrance fees&quot; like the
Plane of Sky and Plane of Hate? I say that purely third hand of course. My
characters may see the Planes sometime in 2004.<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Hrm. Maybe one... I can't say much without revealing some of the
puzzle involving that particular zone, though.&nbsp; It's definitely the
exception, though, and not the rule.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; If you could go back a few years and redesign Everquest from
scratch, what changes would you make?<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; I'd try to positively address some of the following problems:
camping, players outleveling their friends, kill stealing, attributes not
mattering enough, bottom feeding, assaulting encounters with too many people,
trains, downtime, etc. But I won't say how :)<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Aw come on. You can tell us about Star Wars Online. Really!<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Please?<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; I'm not above begging.<br>
<br>
* Aradune lips are sealed, sorry.<br>
* Aradune chuckles.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; I'll say this, SWO is not the only game that will benefit from
what we've learned and our experiences.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; You cruel, cruel man.<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; I did want people to know, though, that we consider many of
these issues as important and while we believe EQ is the best MMORPG out there
and are damn proud, we definitely plan on making even better games in the
future. In other words, we're not sitting atop the Vision(TM), resting on our
laurels, that's for damn sure. We really do want to make a game as appealing to
as many people as possible but also want to stay true to the fact that we're
interested in making games that we want to play too. We're gamers, and that we
do this all out of love for MMORPGs. We have all sorts of ideas for the future,
and we appreciate everyone sticking with us for so long.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; That's about all for this interview - is there any question you wish
you've been asked in one of these that never comes up?<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; It can't be &quot;are you married?&quot;, I saw that once.<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Hrm.<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Anything at all... bar-b-q sauce recipes, how best to kill Jar-Jar
in SWO2....<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Heh, I can't think of one I haven't been asked, that's for sure.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; I get them all, I think :)<br>
<br>
&lt;Lum&gt; Well, thanks for your time.<br>
<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; Thanks much :)<br>
