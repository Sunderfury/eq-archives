<p align=left><img border="0" src="http://lum.xrgaming.net/lum.jpg" align="left" width="50" height="50"><font face="Courier New, Courier"><font size="4"><b>THE LAST WORD ON U9</b></font> <font size="3" color="#C0C0C0">Monday, November 29, 1999 - 12:17 AM<br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica">When I went to Best Buy Wednesday, I was, strange to say, actually pleased to see the huge stacks of Ultima 9s going on the shelf. Hey, the more folks that buy this, the more that might move into playing these games <a href="http://www.uo.com/">full time</a>.<br><br>I've half a mind to swing by Monday and see if they're still there. According to folks on Usenet as well as <a href="http://www.thechosen.com">Jinx</a>, they aren't. The last time I can recall that happening was with the first-person shooter <a href="http://www.ritual.com/sin/">SiN</a>, another well-meaning "ground breaking" title that was kicked out the door about six months too soon.<br><br>I don't know if the rumors are true about Origin being ordered to release this title too early, that the QA team gave it a "Fail" and that it was shoved into release anyway. I do know that, as I struggle to get further into the game, in its current state it is unplayable. I finally gave up in Hythloth (the second dungeon in the game); the interface was just too counter-intuitive, the engine too slow. I finally cut on the cheat codes (an Ultima with cheat codes, gotta love it) and flew around in no-clip mode looking for the Red Key to get me into the room to push the Blue Button. <br><br>Origin made an attempt at salvaging a decent game out of this - the story itself is pretty good, although hamfisted in parts and not at all subtle (Methinks Garriot is not fond of lawsuits, for example). However, to call it a roleplaying game is a misnomer, unless your version of roleplaying is running around looking like Woody Harrelson and being called the Avatar (after about the fiftieth "Good day, Avatar" I felt like screaming "I HAVE A NAME, DAMN YOU!"). It's an adventure game, sort of like Kings Quest but with moral lessons and swordswinging. Which isn't bad, but it's a far cry from other, <a href="http://www.uo.com/archive/ultima7/">better games</a>.<br><br>So is Ultima 9 worth buying? Only if you have a Voodoo card. The fact that U9 crashes TNT2/GeForce 3D cards is utterly unfathomable. You know, this is why Origin <b>has</b> a goddamned QA team. Or had. Hell, if they did pass on this one, they deserved to be axed. I mean, did anyone even BOTHER to run this thing in D3D mode? "Hey, guys, um, it won't run on this card." "Aw, ship it anyway, we'll work on a patch after the holidays." Maybe I should forward Lord British Derek Smart's email address, I hear he's got <a href="http://www.3000ad.com/">some experience</a> in post-release patches.<br><br>So Ultima 9 is a bomb. The obvious question, then, what about Ultima Online 2? And will its engine actually run on most people's systems?

<!--ktalk start_fields: start_email  end_email start_name Nelno end_name end_fields--><!--ktalk start_comment-->Ya know, I have a TNT2, and I would honestly be really pissed if I actually had up-to-date drivers.<br><br>I'll explain: I got U9, and after about 15 minutes of troubleshooting, got it to run, albeit with really poor quality graphics settings and a piss-poor framerate.  So I figured, why not see if there are any updated drivers from my TNT2?  I get the new devestator (or whatever they called it) drivers and try to load up U9.  THAT is when the game completely stopped working for me.  Eventually I was able to reload my old drivers, and ater ALOT of troubleshooting, I can now play U9 on my TNT2 with a bearable framerate at 640x480x16 graphics.  Of course, the framerate still slows to a crawl during some of the scenes with massive ammounts of polys, but it works just fine in the dungeons.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

They also said that a future patch would address improvements in D3D performance. I read this to mean that a) TNT2 users will be JUST FINE very soon and b) the D3D problem is BIG.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

Apparently, Origin is the only EA affliliate that doesn't go through EA's own internal QnA. I trust this source. I have no information on the report of Origin's own team failing the product.<br>2) I bought a new computer, a Micron PIII 600 with a GeForce pretty much for this game. (and because my old P200 wasn't cutting it anymore) The fac that it will not run on it has me a tad upset.<br>3) Ultima 8 was a good enough game... on it's *own* merits. Taken in context of the rest of the Ultima heritage, it's crap.<br>4) My buddy who has a voodoo2 based system, while he acknowledges the gameplay bugs, is raving about the in - game vistas and the storyline. In his opinion, they more than make up for the bugs. Since I can't run it, I wouldn't know.<br>4) Both that buddy and myself are programmers, and we're working with the Unreal code base (for Werewold: Heart of Gaia). To everyone who says that Origin should have liscenced Unreal: no. The poly counts between the two are *staggeringly* different. They couldn't have pulled off 1/100 the interesting geometry that you see in U9 screenshots.<br><br>Thank you and good night.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

On my system, it's playable, not fast, but not numbingly slow. I am lucky enough to have a first gen tnt which for some odd reason, runs the game decently *when you tweak your system properly*<br><br>I admit to having a lot of beta testing experience, so I have an eye for even little bugs. This drives me nuts as I notice every little thing. Most aren;t showstoppers. But I have been having a loadin problem in the morning from the previous night's save. I have done moonglow 3 times now. That is an even bigger pain in the ass due to the buggy flying crystal ship.<br><br>Oh. I was pretty vexed at Hythloth, but after I mapped it (didnt take long) it was a breeze, though I cut out when I got to the teleporter....<br><br>And lowlight, play u7 and u7.5.<!--ktalk end_comment-->

The first version would have you being knocked backwards onto the ground after a decent hit. Not a good thing when you are in front of some water. <br> I read somewhere that Lord British says the Ultima virtue system is not his own personal system of virtue. Amen to that. If he wasn't such a greedy bastard he would have kept Ultima for himself and kept making quality products. Instead he whored out the good name of Ultima and the stupidly faithful have kept buying it. <!--ktalk end_comment-->

It isn't the easiest thing to do.. There are about 3 good 3d engines out there right now (Looking Glass' Dark Engine, Surreal's Riot Engine, and of course Monolith's Lithtech is nice too) any one of those would be suitable for an rpg game, with the right changes... I Quake 1/2/3 or Unreal engines are too action oriented from the beginning.. every attempt at an RPG using these engines usually fails (think Wheel of Time)<br><br>Anyway, another thing I wanted to bring up is a post on VoodooExtreme, from an anonymous OSI employee.. they said that Electronic Arts basically said that if the game wasn't shipped by Thanksgiving, they could forget about having it released at all... This really isn't hard to believe when you think about it... Publishers are the bane of game developers' existance...<br><br>And one more thing.. I was wondering.. I have only played 2 Ultima games; Ultima Online and Ultima 8.  Everyone says U8 is awful, but I really enjoyed it; what gives?<!--ktalk end_comment-->
