<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Tale of the Dragon </font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the age of 15, some of us are 
  given permission to drive the family car. If your name happens to be Peter A. 
  Baumann, your dad lets you start a MMORPG. Herein lies the tale of <a href="http://www.reddragonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Red 
  Dragon Software</a>, and the greatest story of vaporware in the short history 
  of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1999, people began hearing of 
  a new game to hit the market. The game planned for a capacity of nearly a million 
  users. It promised a land mass hundreds of times larger than any other MMORPG 
  on the market. The <a href="http://www.reddragonsoftware.com/faq_files/gf.htm" target="_blank">FAQ</a> 
  read as if written by customers who had left EQ or UO dissatisfied. Red Dragon 
  Software would give us multiple player races, housing space for everyone, the 
  ability to influence the politics of the world. It seemed to be the Holy Grail 
  the community was looking for. By December of 1999, over 500 people would have 
  sent in fifty dollars to play in the beta. By January they would be screaming 
  for refunds. Today only the web site, and a burnt out husk of a <a href="http://server5.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion%20" target="_blank">message 
  board</a> seem to remain. </font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The Promise </font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Chuck", not his real name for fear 
  of legal reprisals, remembers the first time he heard of Rune Conquest. "A coworker 
  showed me the site. Both of us had quit UO, and we were looking for something 
  new. I just wish that we hadn't found that." Chuck wasn't alone. Over 500 people 
  sent Red Dragon Software 50 dollars to take part in the beta test. Many more 
  waited on the sidelines for the chance to play. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The FAQ for the game looked too good 
  to be true. It promised that between 5,000 and 100,000 players would be able 
  to play at once on the same "sphere". Red Dragon Software would be maintaining 
  over 5 spheres, with a plan to go up to 20 within the first year. They promised 
  graphics to surpass any current game. How good would the graphics be? Well, 
  according to the games FAQ "I would like to remind these players that even if 
  you DO have to drop the graphical quality of Rune Conquest down to that of Asheron's 
  Call, or even lower Rune Conquest will still be more fun.". Better graphics 
  than Asheron's Call? But what about trade skills? Once again, the FAQ; " Some 
  of Rune Conquest's MANY actual "trade" skills include: Armor Craft, Weapon Craft, 
  Glass Blowing, Alchemy, Weaving, Carpentry, Architecture, Gem Cutting, Jeweling 
  [sic], Taxidermy, Tailoring, Stone Cutting, Sculpting, Mining, Enchanting, Lumberjacking, 
  Farming, Ranching, Bow Crafting/Fletching, Basic Metal Craft, Advanced Metal 
  Craft, Canvas Painting, Object Painting, Tinkering, Pottery, Fishing, and Tanning." 
  They even promised housing for everybody. With multiple player races, and superb 
  Player vs. Player combat options, this seemed like the next step in the market.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What kind of company could make a 
  game like that to compete against games published by Electronic Arts, Sony and 
  Microsoft? In the case of Red Dragon Software, it would be <a href="http://www.purestrokegolf.com/" target="_blank">a 
  golf supply distribution company</a> and the owner's 15 year old son. Peter 
  Baumann Sr. describes himself as a multi millionaire whose first company "<a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=49.topic" target="_blank">invented 
  and sold the first cordless phone</a>" (much to the surprise of the folks at 
  AT+T). His son was 15 years old and <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=41.topic" target="_blank">according 
  to the father</a>, "He wants to "home school" ASAP so he can work full time 
  on his computer games. He's designed five to date. He has attended private schools 
  all his (short) life. Next Spring he's going to take the California High School 
  Proficiency Test so he can graduate High School two years early." At the time 
  of this article, the five games in question are unknown. At one point, Peter 
  Jr. brought to his Father an idea for a company. With Ultima Online taking in 
  over 1.7 million dollars a month in subscriptions alone, why not tap into that 
  market? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By December of '99, some would wonder 
  if the company ever really existed at all.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. "Was I stupid for sending money 
  in?" </font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While many of us were sitting down 
  for Thanksgiving dinner, others were getting exciting about the beta test for 
  Rune Conquest. It was the end of November, and the beta was going to start in 
  just over a month. The ride was about to get very bumpy. </font></p>
<table border="0" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">

      <div align="center"><img src="104.gif" width="318" height="238"><br>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A sample screenshot

        from the Red Dragon Software web site.</font> </div>

</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"For me, I started getting suspicious 
  when they posted the screenshots" says "Chuck". "At first they were reluctant 
  to do so…and then when they did it just made things worse." For a game that 
  promised to blow the competition away graphics wise, the screenshots would begin 
  to open a can of worms that wouldn't ever be closed. The screenshots were in 
  8-bit graphics, with the textures taken directly from Quake. Peter Baumann Jr., 
  posting under the name of "<a href="http://server5.ezboard.com/brealmofconquest.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thedarkone" target="_blank">The 
  Dark One</a>" on the message boards, along with his father, who posted using 
  the alias <a href="http://server5.ezboard.com/brealmofconquest.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=purestroke">&quot;PURESTROKE</a>&quot;, 
  would offer an explanation. The poor quality of the screenshots, according to 
  Baumann, was because of a malfunctioning graphics card. If that was the case, 
  why not just go out and pick up a Voodoo card? As Baumann would <a href="http://server5.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=34.topic&amp;index=10" target="_blank">write 
  in a message</a>, "the 8-bit screenshots are something that we are dealing with. 
  I would like to explain to those of you who do not understand how corporations 
  work the reasons behind our graphics cards malfunctioning. You see, big corporations 
  have to order hardware like this in bulk in order to get reasonable prices for 
  all of the hardware. This is what Red Dragon did. Most of the graphics cards 
  we received from a company I will not name here do not work."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An odd explanation, to be sure, but 
  enough of one for people to send in money to RDS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You see, RDS was doing something 
  unheard of in the MMORPG industry. It was going to charge people to take part 
  in the Beta. For 50 dollars, not only would the beta testers be allowed in the 
  first round of testing, but they were making an investment. Players who gave 
  RDS money would be given deity powers inside the game… powers they could keep 
  even after the game opened for good.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Call it what you will: blind faith, 
  wanting to be part of an elitist group, or just hoping to be a part of something 
  really special" said Chris Roth, one of the people who paid for the beta, "I 
  am proud to say that I pre-ordered a game based on the hope that it will be 
  all that the makers said it will be." Others weren't so sure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Was I stupid for sending money in?" 
  asks Chuck. "I guess part of it was that I was greedy. Look how much rare items 
  sell for on eBay. If I was given special privileges, I thought that I could 
  make a fortune selling my account down the road. Besides, I was still excited 
  about the game. Every interview they posted on their site promised something 
  new and exciting. Besides, what kind of company would charge for a product that 
  didn't actually exist, at least in some form?" </font></p>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A sample screenshot

</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What exactly did exist? The similarity 
  between the screenshots and Quake wouldn't be the only one noticed. On the website 
  was a picture of a dragon. For some it was a very familiar dragon, one that 
  they had seen before… from a Dungeons and Dragons game. For a game that promised 
  hundreds and hundreds of creatures, why would they have a stolen image of a 
  dragon? There was also a question of music files they had on the site. The game 
  promised hour after hour of original music. Good music, too. Not the repetitive 
  "adventure" music found in other MMORPG games. Why then were the only music 
  files on the site MP3s of public domain songs of pop and heavy metal acts of 
  the eighties? If the game was going to go to beta in a month, where is the content?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Did Red Dragon Software even exist 
  at all? One poster presented his case that it didn't.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Neither Pure Stroke Golf, nor Red 
  Dragon Software exist as corporations in the state of California. (or any other 
  state under the names Pete Baumann, or Chris Anderson.) Pete Baumann owns corporations 
  in Florida, Texas, Minnesota, California, Colorado, etc. Why would he not incorporate 
  Pure Stroke Golf and Red Dragon Software?" reported one person in an e-mail 
  sent to <a href="http://www.mastersage.com/ubb/ubbhtml/Forum1/HTML/000027.html" target="_blank">Mastersage</a>, 
  a web site operator of an Ultima Online related site. "Pure Stroke has supposedly 
  been in business since 1991. The web page was <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois?STRING=reddragonsoftware.com" target="_blank">registered 
  on October 4th at Network Solutions, Inc</a>. Both sites are registered to Mr. 
  Chris Anderson, [web master and programmer allegedly working on the game] and 
  not to Pure Stroke Golf, Red Dragon Software, or even Pete Baumann."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peter Baumann would be able to refute 
  these claims, but eventually the domain registration process would come back 
  to haunt him.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. "I now feel our lives are in 
  danger"</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Most of us in the business 
  world have heard the expression "the customer is always right". In Peter Baumann's 
  world, the customer was always a child… a vicious child out to destroy his life's 
  work. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">"Once again, we have an 
  anonymous individual who is afraid to identify himself (or herself)." <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=57.topic" target="_blank">ranted 
  Pete</a> after a poster on a message board questioned the policy of paying for 
  a beta test. " $50 to beta test? NO! $50 for additional benefits that no-one 
  else will receive, benefits that may be worth a lot in a few years, at no risk! 
  How old are you, Falenkai? Do you have any business experience? What is your 
  success story? Like I thought, NONE!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This would be the side of 
  Peter Baumann the customers would see from now on. Gone were the days of discussion 
  between RDS and the fan base. Now was the time for angry recriminations. Soon 
  RDS would begin to eat their own.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">"Who is Blueknight?" <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=122.topic" target="_blank">Peter 
  Jr. asked</a> about one detractor "I'm pretty sure I know who he is. Two months 
  ago we interviewed about 35 potential new programmers for Rune Conquest. We…almost 
  hired one in particular, we even entered into a contract with him to give him 
  stock in our company if he came on board…but the more we checked out their references, 
  the more we suspected a scam. We ended up not hiring them, especially when we 
  caught one of them trying to steal company secrets about Rune Conquest. Now 
  to the present. My dad has friends at the FBI, and as I am typing this response 
  to the supposed doubting-Thomases, my dad is talking to his agent friend as 
  to how they will track down Blueknight and make him pay for his actions...effective 
  immediately we are 1) starting a search for Blueknight and his associates, 2) 
  instructing our attorneys to prepare a civil action against them (in the event 
  the Feds do not proceed with criminal action"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Another incident occurred 
  when one of the potential Rune Conquest players filled out a phony form for 
  a piece of golf equipment at Peter Baumann's other site. "Pure Stroke Golf will 
  issue $1,000 in stock in Red Dragon Software, Inc. to the first person who identifies 
  the moron who submitted the above order on the Pure Stroke website," <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=74.topic" target="_blank">proclaimed 
  Peter</a> on a public forum. "You game players on the Rune Conquest Zone forum 
  seem to think I, Pete Baumann, treat you with disrespect. When idiots like the 
  child who filled out the above order sheet act like children, you'll have to 
  excuse me if I don't take some of you seriously."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">All this was nothing compared 
  to what his own employee would receive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Chris Anderson is a web 
  server owner who does hosting for assorted companies. In October of 1999 Peter 
  Baumann approached Chris to host a web site for his golf company. Chris went 
  and registered the domain names in his own name. Chris was also brought on board, 
  apparently to work as a programmer for Rune Conquest (his exact role, however, 
  remains unclear even today.) Eventually <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=124.topic&amp;index=6" target="_blank">Peter 
  demanded the domain names be turned over</a> to him instead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">"<a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=126.topic" target="_blank">I 
  am posting this message</a> to let you all know that I Chris Anderson and My 
  Wife Laurie Anderson feel as though our lifes have been now threatened by Mr. 
  Pete Baumann." Posted Chris on the message forum. "Mr. Baumann seems to need 
  mental help and if anything is to happen to my wife and I, I want you to know 
  who is responsible for it!…I now feel our lifes are in danger and have hired 
  help but I'm afraid he is capable of more than a simple court suit. I have deleted 
  both of his web sites and plan on keeping you all posted daily in the event 
  he try's physical harm to my family. This is NOT A JOKE!" </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It may have been paranoid, 
  but in Chris' mind, it wasn't a joke. Why did he feel his life threatened? We 
  may never actually know, but within a few hours, and a <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=126.topic&amp;index=8" target="_blank">conversation 
  with Peter Baumann</a>, Chris <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=126.topic&amp;index=11" target="_blank">recanted 
  his post</a>. Legal issues would continue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/frealmofconquestruneconquestdiscussion.showMessage?topicID=126.topic&amp;index=5" target="_blank">Peter 
  Baumann claims</a> that Chris Anderson, when he left, took with him all the 
  files needed to maintain the Rune Conquest web site. The web site would be down 
  for over a month while the situation was resolved. While this was taking place, 
  the date for the beta test came and went.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. "We just wanted a refund!"</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">While Peter claimed a dispute 
  over missing files had delayed the beta test, other questions were coming up. 
  The most pressing question of all once again involved the screenshots. While 
  many people noticed the similarity between the original Quake engine and the 
  screenshots, other noticed something even more damning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Those exact screenshots 
  had been used by somebody else….<a href="http://www.conitec.com/a4info.htm" target="_blank">a 
  program called A4</a>, from 3-D Gamestudio.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">What is A4? A4 is a 3-d 
  development engine, for those learning how to program in a 3-d environment. 
  The screenshots, according to those who owned a copy of the program, were unmodified 
  shots from the shareware version of the engine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">With the date for the beta 
  test past, people were forced to wonder if there was even the beginning of an 
  engine. Some rushed to Rune Conquests defense, mentioning how the professional 
  version of the A4 engine was being used by a game called "Unknown", and that 
  it did indeed support multiplayer options. Others pointed out that even if that 
  was true, the multiplayer option in the engine wouldn't be able to handle even 
  a thousand players….let alone the 100,000 advertised by Rune Conquest. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">More damning, why use screenshots 
  from a demo program included with the engine? If they were within even 2 years 
  of actually going to beta, why wasn't there an original screenshot? Why claim 
  that the engine for Rune Conquest was written from scratch, when evidence suggested 
  a situation much to the contrary?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A cry went up from the beta 
  testers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">"When we wanted a refund" 
  says Chuck "it took forever for them to get around to offering me one." Others 
  would decide to stick with them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">"I guess the main deciding 
  factor in staying with them" says Chris Roth "is that I wanted to be part of 
  something special. I like being part of a select group of people who showed 
  support for an upcoming game by ordering it in advance, even when a completion 
  date has not been set. Paying $50 to get into a project that could become an 
  outstanding online role playing game seemed to me a small price to pay. I still 
  have great hope for this game and very much want to be a part of it." When was 
  the last time he heard from RDS? "I last received an email from them on the 
  first week of March. It was talking about the email they sent in late February 
  saying they were canceling the preorders and giving everyone a refund (an email 
  which I never received), and then how because of the outcry from the pre-order 
  folks, decided not to cancel after all. Since then I have sent them 2 emails, 
  one a suggestion and the other to report a change of email address. I have not 
  received a reply regarding either email that I have sent. I am disappointed 
  with the lack of consistent updates, but from what I have read they are having 
  some trouble with this Chris Anderson guy, so I am hoping things ill pick up 
  once that mess is ironed out."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Nietzsche would respond, 
  "Hope, in reality, is the worst of all evils, because it prolongs the torments 
  of man."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">What is the status of Red 
  Dragon Software, and their flagship product Rune Conquest? It seems that only 
  15 year old Peter Baumann Jr. holds the answer. Speculation abounds amongst 
  those who were a pert of this story. Even today, some will hold to the position 
  that there never was a Red Dragon Software in the first place. Others believe 
  that if there was a scam perpetrated, that it was by Peter Jr. on his own father, 
  giving him false expectations about a product that could not be delivered. Talk 
  to others, and it was the father trying to scam money from a customer base he 
  knew little about.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Finally there are those 
  who believe that there is still a game there… a game that, if it ever gets released, 
  will be everything that was promised.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">"The Warlord", allegedly 
  a developer on the game, no longer responds to e-mail messages or ICQ. The message 
  board hasn't be used for months. The web site, now back up, has removed some 
  things from their FAQ, removed the music files, the stolen art work, and still 
  promises that a game will be released. E-mail sent to RDS remains unanswered. 
  Chris Anderson has vanished, his phone disconnected. "Chuck" has yet to receive 
  his refund, while Chris Roth, and players like him, still wait for the day that 
  the beta begins.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><br>
