  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>(Special early adopter note: 
    Pictures along with this story will be posted when Bob and I can get back 
    together -- E3 is a zoo and we're pretty much seperate for the great majority 
    of it -- until then, experience the majesty and purity of plain text. - Lum, 
    Charles In Charge)</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't let anybody tell you Los 
    Angeles sucks. That's not true. In fact, there's nothing wrong with the place 
    that ten pounds of Sarin nerve gas can't fix. Really. After I exterminate 
    the population, it'll be turned into a game preserve and a resort for my legions 
    of undead shock troops. Everyone will love it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dragging along my friend Ryan, 
    and leaving the women folks at home, I landed in L.A. I felt giddy as a school 
    girl as I walked into the main hall. I used to take acid. I know what sensory 
    overload is like. Brother, let me tell you it ain't nothing compared to E3. 
    The convention hall was a cacophony of noise, lights and the smell of unwashed, 
    eager geek. Desginers, ripped from the comfort of their cubicles, are forced 
    to stand in front of the wave of humanity, desperatly trying to show what 
    they've been working on. They look like tired prostitues, lifting their skirts 
    in the hope that their pimps in the marketing department won't beat them too 
    bad. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since I cover MMORPGs, I decided 
    that I would start there. Pushing past the booth babes, I headed to the Electronic 
    Arts booth. A giant video screen pumped images of snowboarders and pixelated 
    hockey players. To the left, stood the booth for the Sims. A waifish girl 
    stood demonstrating a new game called "Sim Town". Surrounded by sweaty game 
    fans, she demonstrated the features. "It looks a great deal like Sim City" 
    I said. She nodded. "It's more personal" she told me. "In Sim City, you can 
    tear down a factory and people move away, but this games shows who those people 
    are. You can follow a family, and see what effect your decisions have". I 
    nodded. I asked her if Will Wright was working on the game. She began to tremble. 
    With wet, terrified eyesshe looked up at me. "He over-sees the game" she wispered. 
    "If he doesn't like what he sees, he threatens to pay us in sim-checks, and 
    force-feed us sim food." She broke into tears. "The man's a tyrant! He thinks 
    of us like the characters in the Sims. He thinks he can tickle us to get us 
    to like him! Help me!" </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was nothing I could do for 
    her. With the madness around me, I couldn't even be sure if she had really 
    said that last part, or if I was just hallucinating. The flashing lights were 
    like an epeleptic strobe light burrowing right into my skull. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had hopes to see the UO booth. 
    After all, EQ had one complete with half naked elf chick. There was no booth 
    for UO to be found. Instead was some pansy ass Brit wandering around in a 
    UO shirt, looking over his shoulder for a death robe clad stalker. He told 
    me that there was no booth, and that the only meeting room was upstairs...and, 
    after looking to see if I had a press pass, he assured me I certainly wouldn't 
    be allowed within a hundred feet of the UO team. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I might have had a few drinks in 
    me, but I was able to resist the urge to punch him in the face. Fuck you though. 
    And the limey horse you rode in on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What's at E3</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would have wasted my time if 
    I didn't bring you some news of what's actualy at this conference. Let's run 
    down the list, shall we? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Anarchy Online:</i> I swear 
    to christ, I've been walking around with a hard on the size of Nebraska since 
    seeing this game. Those Europeans might not be able to survive a walk through 
    an American ghetto, but they understand gaming. Expect a great deal more coverage 
    from Lumcorp in the future. You know what made the difference? Every single 
    god damn developer seems almost reluctant to show their goods. Anarchy Online 
    delights in it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Warcraft III:</i> Here's something 
    fun to do. Ask a developer showing off the game if what we're seeing on the 
    floor is the actual game itself, or the game after they decided to re-tool 
    it. Watch them mumble and sweat. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Diablo II:</i> They got a winner 
    here, and they know it. I don't know it, since I couldn't get within twenty 
    frickin' feet of the monitor. Given the puddle of drool at the feet of those 
    who could actually get close to the game itself, it looks good. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Sovreign:</i> I can't believe 
    it. Verant may actually wind up releasing a game that doesn't make me want 
    to gouge out my own eyeballs. No Skinner box here. They took Empire, slapped 
    on some graphics on it, and there you go. Look for an interview with the devloper 
    coming soon, here at Lumcorp. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Everquest: Ruins of Karnak:</i> 
    Here's a way to have some more fun at E3. Go up the EQ booth and pretend to 
    be interested. Ask the devloper showing the game off questions like "So what 
    is there to do in the game? Is there housing? Can you ride horses?". Look 
    really disapointed when they can't give you a positive answer. Next year, 
    you'll probably be able to do the same thing to UO2. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Vampire: The Masquerade:</i> 
    Three weeks. That's what they promised for the release date. Of course, they 
    were pretty vauge about if they would have all the storyteller tools ready 
    by then, but that's what patches are for, right? Right? Actually, the game 
    looks good. Real good. I wouldn't even let people who like the game Vampire 
    in my house, but this game I might just buy....after the patch, of course. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Shadowbane:</i> The UO2 movie 
    kicks ass. You've all seen it. I'm telling you now that Anarchy Online is 
    the best damn game you haven't played yet...but what of Shadowbane? Well, 
    perhaps it was the sun and the beer but I'm not ready to start praying at 
    the altar of SB yet. As far as I can tell, they don't walk on water, they 
    don't bear the marks of stigmata and not one of them has been nailed to a 
    cross yet. I'm still waiting to be proved wrong, but if the UO2 movie and 
    Anarchy Online are to be the main competition for this game, they may be in 
    trouble. On the other hand, the flaming arows look pretty damn cool and they 
    had midgets, beer and playboy bunnies at their booths, so what the hell. </font></p>
