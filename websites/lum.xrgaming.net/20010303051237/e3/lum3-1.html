    Palm Pilot choked a hairball and lost my entire schedule. Our party got seperated 
    and one was left without a pass. Did I mention traffic? It was a busy day, 
    all around.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I asked Raph Koster if he 
    was going to be at E3, he told me that it was basically the world's largest 
    video arcade and not much actual discussion went on. This was, of course, 
    before Koster became Verant's newest acquisition and he, along with the entire 
    Verant-Austin team, was out and around denying that they were actually working 
    on anything. He was right partially, though - E3 is like a big video arcade 
    where none of the big kids actually let you play the games. You have to shouldersurf 
    and hope someone will walk off for a second so you can hijack the controls.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I didn't spend much </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">time 
    wandering the booths, due to the aformentioned hell-morning, but did get to 
    check in on Blizzard's booth, which was showing Warcraft 3. If you could actually 
    elbow the hundreds of people who also wanted to see Warcraft 3 aside, you 
    saw a game with the usual Blizzard insane intricate detail. Warcraft 3 looked 
    a lot like Warcraft 2, only cooler. Cooler is, you know, cool. Thus ends my 
    Warcraft 3 review based on my detailed source material (five minutes of watching 
    some guy set waypoints)</font> </p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the Anarchy Online and Shadowbane 
    sessions, Great Bob and I got some time with Gordon Walton, Tyrantus Supremus 
    of what we think is still called Origin. He was kind enough to produce the 
    marketeers who came up with &quot;Enchantress Emily&quot; and The Game Formerly 
    Known As UO2's new title. He was then even more kind enough to block the door 
    as we... questioned them. You will be pleased to know that we showed the author 
    of Enchantress Emily <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003552.html">the 
    thread regarding her mailout on our gimped forum</a>. We also explained to 
    her that Enchanters were actually in their <b>competitor's </b>game. Gordon 
    seemed remarkably amused by all of this. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for TGFKAUO2, we were shown 
    a mockup of the box. Hey, gotta get the important things done first. Actually 
    it wasn't even pretending to be the final version of TGFKAUO2's box, but concept 
    art to show that the name &quot;Origin&quot; was in REALLY REALLY REALLY BIG 
    letters and the words &quot;Ultima World Online&quot; was in really really 
    small type. Basically &quot;Ultima World Online&quot; is a brand name, sort 
    of like Oldsmobile or Wu-Tang, and the name of the game is really &quot;Origin&quot;. 
    You know, like the company that dare not speak its name. Also, the woman on 
    the Origin box was actually dressed. We're told that the artist who did the 
    UO:R box is <a href="http://www.westwood.com/">somewhere else</a> now.</font></p>

          Raph Koster and Chris Meyer, just damned happy to<br>
          be here. That's Marduk behind them, going &quot;Jesus,<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then came dinner with Gordon, the 
    entire Verant-Austin team, Jessica Mulligan, who was promising everyone they 
    would be the first or second to hear what she was actually working on now 
    when she could say, and John Taylor, whose recent game &quot;Legends of Kesmai&quot; 
    recieved a small amount of press in these parts. (His comment - &quot;It had 
    a run of 14 years where most games have a lifespan of about six months. I 
    think we did pretty well.&quot;) Most of the conversation was immensely interesting 
    and totally off the record, but Rich Vogel let us tell the world about his 
    dream concept while at Origin --</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's right, the Ultima Online 
    you knew you always wanted. A full skill system, player craftable items, geographic 
    seperation of player &quot;preferences&quot;, <b>real </b>dungeons, and a 
    whole new meaning to Buccaneer's Den. Basically someone at EA told him they 
    wanted a game that could get a million subscribers, and well, you know...</font></p>
