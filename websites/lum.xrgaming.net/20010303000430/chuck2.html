      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here an email from a Canadian 
        so you can bitch at us freely.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I liked the Banstyle commentary. 
        What this kid is experiencing (UO Market) is what thousands of people 
        will be experiencing in the next few years; relatively soon you will see 
        this phenomenon taking on larger proportions. Of course, I am sure some 
        psychiatrists are making money out of internet addiction but I bet you 
        that in a few years some will begin to specialise in a different category. 
        Who`s gonna be the Freud of MMRPG addiction, the one who's gonna fly across 
        the continent attracted by the money of those rich parents who are sure 
        that only psychiatric therapy can cure their child of his addiction. We've 
        all heard stories of those brillant children who gave up their career 
        for drugs, this friend we had that was so intelligent before he lost all 
        because of his addiction to cocaine, marijuana, pcp etc... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know a lot of my friends 
        who have thrown their life away because of drugs, a lot of people who 
        have commited suicide because the addiction was too strong and they reached 
        the point of no return. I know others who were expelled from college because 
        they smoked pot in the bathroom, or in the campus. Some got it the first 
        time, they took direction and decided to follow the line and are now doing 
        a respectable job, have kids and well, live a normal happy life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But when we enter the realm 
        of virtual addiction it`s another thing. I don`t consider myself addicted, 
        some would... Ultima Online, Everquest, the upcoming Asheron`s Call will 
        never be illegal. There is no pusher at the corner of the street selling 
        a cd of a mmrpg game that he hides in his backpack while looking in both 
        directions to see if a police car is coming. Ha ha no, hell c'mon, it`s 
        only a game as we all know, and as DD knows also, as McQuaid knows also, 
        as Jason Booth knows also. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But wait... We all know also 
        that it`s not ONLY a game. It will never be illegal to push the start 
        button, to log on as the Great Zarks the awful player killer that is climbing 
        on the bounty board. There is no police to tell you to stop playing the 
        game and to give this hour of parental love to your daughter, there is 
        no barmaid to tell you that this kill in BlackBurrow is the last one as 
        he would do with an alcoholic while giving him his last tasty Budweiser. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It`s only up to you to say 
        it`s enough. It will only be up to the gamer to shut down his computer 
        (with his finger or with his .12 winchester) and to face the real consequences. 
        Here there is no mundane John McIntire that traps chests at the local 
        box factory, there is no Nighthawk that lost his 2 story because a gm 
        is pissed to see him repeating always the same action. Here it`s also 
        a crazy world, and we all know that this world is more weird, more crazy 
        and more violent than any of these virtual worlds. Hey, don`t get me wrong, 
        there is no red guy who waits behind a tree waiting to cast corp por at 
        your ass... Nah... But in the world we live there is something strange 
        called reality, something called consequences. The Edge is that line between 
        the reality and the fiction, "le génie et la folie". </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here an idea for some of you 
        losers, here is an idea for some of you winners. Genius or stupid? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Asheron Call is gonna 
        hit the shelves buy it. Find a European, if you are an American or vice-versa. 
        Share your account and create this super char that everyone is dreaming 
        about. Powergame it! Get this 110 level char, only specialise in the better 
        skills, get the better armour, the better weapon. Sell it on Ebay but 
        please don`t stop here. Continue! Do it for all those games that come 
        out, create a super char and trade your account for real money. Who cares 
        if you declare it on your taxes or not, it`s just a virtual possession. 
        Take the money, baby! Don`t stop here. Make more money, don`t you think 
        everyone wants to know about you? Get this thing on paper, write a book, 
        publish it, sell it. Isn`t what you all want to do? Here is my story, 
        here is my virtual exploitation of these no life people, here is my way 
        to get you out of all consequences. I am the master of the dream, the 
        master of the illusion, I can build you a super character where you can 
        be all that you ever wanted to be, welcome in my world (only if you have 
        enough money) here you are God and everyone wants to look like you. You 
        are the superchar, the superman and you didn`t give a minute of your time 
        for it. Welcome to my world, you are the superstar! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No, wait! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No. You are not a god, you 
        are better than a god, because here, there is no consequences! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have you seen the last god 
        I sold on e-Bay? He is the greatest, he kills all the monsters, no one 
        can kill him! Mohahahah Just too bad he is not on the earth hey? Wait 
        a minute, I just saw him passing..... Yes here he his, his name is Jesus 
        and he is on e-Bay. I can buy it for $100,000. Too bad I don`t have enough 
        money because I would buy it and play it in my virtual world (earth), 
        because in my virtual world (earth) he is so rich and so strong that he 
        defeats every monster (Milosevic anyone?) He is also so advanced in magic 
        that he discovered the way to be always happy (Yes, he is the illumination 
        you are waiting for), he is so powerful and so wise that he will bring 
        redemption to the world. Darn, too bad I don`t have the money to buy Jesus 
        on e-Bay because I would save the world. Poor world, If only I could win 
        the lottery I would all buy you a Super Jesus Char so you can all save 
        these virtual worlds and forget that the world we live in is... facing 
        the real consequences of your real actions! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is that enough derision for 
        you, Lum? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Love,<br>
        Arp </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">===</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I was Chuck's age, my 
        parents warned me of the evils of "Kiss" and the horrible consequences 
        of playing Dungeons and Dragons. They showed me a Tom Hanks movie about 
        a kid who almost kills himself because the "Demon Game" got him messed 
        up in the head. I saw pamphlets and books written by Pat Robertson and 
        Jerry Falwell warning me, "Play Dungeons and Dragons? Go to Hell. Do not 
        pass go, do not collect a harp or a halo." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eventually, and it took almost 
        9 years, the media decided that the horse was dead. Instead, they began 
        to froth over something called "Backwards Masking" where John Lennon sang, 
        "Turn me on dead man." This too lasted about 9 years, until a backwards 
        Mr. Ed the talking horse was heard to say, "I sing my song for Satan." 
        Strangely enough, the "backwards masking" craze faded away. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then it was Magic: The Gathering. 
        Then it was...well, the list could just go on all day. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So mark your calendars. In 
        about ten weeks, we'll hear all about the evil addictive nature of computer 
        games. Games like Ultima Online are destroying our marriages, our families, 
        our careers, our childhood! Destruction everywhere, because of the foul 
        and evil Ultima Online. Now just for fun, replace "Ultima Online" in the 
        above statements with "Dungeons and Dragons". oooooooh. Boy, that sure 
        sounds familiar. Then replace it again with the phrase "Rock and Roll 
        Music". Hrmmmmm. Again, that rings so familiar in the back of my mind. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When will people stop blaming 
        other things for the mistakes they have made in life? When will we stop 
        the molly-coddling irresponsibility? When will we begin to hold people 
        accountable for their own actions and decisions? Based on what I've seen 
        in my life, the blame placed on Rock Music, Dungeons and Dragons, and 
        now Ultima Online; the answer to all these questions is, sadly; never 
        never ever. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What everyone knows, but is 
        afraid to admit out loud for fear of rejection and loss of potential TV 
        airtime, is that the problem is not Rock Music, Dungeons and Dragons, 
        or Ultima Online. The problem is with people who don't have the ability 
        to control themselves. Do you have homework to do? Then do it! Do you 
        have a project due at the office? Then do it! Do you have a family to 
        take care of and support? THEN DO IT! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But stop blaming other things. 
        Stop blaming an inanimate disk of plastic and vinyl. Stop blaming plastic 
        dice and sheets of graph paper. Stop blaming a computer program that sits 
        on 600 megs of your C: drive. If the first step to "recovery" is realization 
        of a problem, then the second step has to be the realization that YOU 
        are the problem. If anyone feels they are spending too much time playing 
        Ultima Online, by all means do something else with your life! I personally 
        recommend Rock Music and playing Dungeons and Dragons. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Definitely stay far far away 
        from that Magic game - Magic bad. Bad bad Magic. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Arcadian Del Sol (Chessie)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do with it what you will but 
        it pissed me off and I really feel a burning need to reply. You see in 
        this whole mess I think what is missing is taking some goddam responsibility 
        for your own goddam actions. So you play UO too much? SO STOP already! 
        What the hell is wrong with you? You feel like you are bad and wrong for 
        playing UO? Terrific. Tell you what. Turn your computer OFF you moron. 
        Yeah you know that button that cuts the power to your computer -- depress 
        or flick it or whatever and go do something else. It really is that easy. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UO is not a drug. It isn't 
        like heroin or cocaine or nicotine or even caffiene. There are no physical 
        consequences if you get up and walk away. It is not a sickness. You won't 
        die from it, it doesn't make you commit crimes (well that's arguable in 
        the realm of hacking but I doubt anyone would commit murder because of 
        UO), it is nothing a drug will be developed for. Playing too much may 
        be a SYMPTOM of something larger, something going on with you and you 
        alone (although many people may also have a similar problem) but it is 
        not the cause. It didn't 'do it to you.' You did it to yourself. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Escapism isn't new to the world. 
        People have been trying to escape from the doldrums of their everyday 
        lives since a lot of the world became rich enough to afford leisure time 
        -- and even, really, before then. Books, movies, TV, music, sports, religion, 
        drugs, politics -- for every person there's a different type of escapism 
        -- you could even call it a different type of addiction. The workaholic 
        is addicted to his or her job -- but no one blames it on the job. We all 
        know its the person, not the vehicle. Same with alcohol. Same with sports. 
        Same with everything. More often than not when you get the person to give 
        up one thing that person slides into the same behavior with another thing. 
        The workaholic decides not to work so much and to spend time with his 
        son. Next thing you know he's coaching little league and putting 24-7 
        type of energy into that. The list goes on. No escapism isn't new -- what 
        is new is blaming the vehicle instead of the person. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Look, if you have personal 
        problems and find yourself spending more time than you consider healthy 
        with online games then more power to you if you decide to stop playing 
        and go do something else. But lets consider the Case of Chuck here. So 
        now Chuck is not playing UO anymore. Instead he's devoting himself just 
        as much to his new crusade against the evil drug that is UO. Oooo big 
        change there! Next thing you know he'll be busy with a new 12-step program. 
        I can see the meetings at UO Anonymous now. "Hi my name is Chuck and I'm 
        a UOaholoic." Give me a freakin break. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you want to stop playing 
        UO then stop. If you don't, then don't. If you have so little control 
        over yourself that you need someone to come and dropkick your computer 
        out a window then call a friend and get yourself some help. Then go do 
        whatever it is you need to do to develop a backbone. But for crying out 
        loud don't come make a big scene out of it and saying UO 'did it to you.' 
        UO didn't do anything to you, OSI didn't do anything to you, and your 
        computer didn't do anything to you. Saying so just makes you sound like 
        a whiney little baby. So grow up and take some responsibility for your 
        actions. We will all feel better about it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Myschyf</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know that you have probably 
        received about 100 different messages about the recent issue of Ultima 
        Online Addiction, so I thought I should add in my own thoughts to take 
        that to 101, just because I like to be awkward. I've been playing UO on 
        and off since November 1997, and EverQuest for a month or two somewhere 
        in that time. Before that, I was an avid Meridian 59 player, so I guess 
        that I have been playing the ORPGs since about January '97. As I'm only 
        18 (would have started at around 15 years old) I had no experience in 
        pen and paper RPG'ing - only in the computer variety. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the main differences 
        about this story is that you all pay around $10 a month to subscribe to 
        this addiction and keep getting your fix, whether it is in the shape of 
        UO, EQ, AC or M59 (or ME in the future). Over in Europe, or in the UK 
        where I am, we have the extra cost of the telephone bills to add on top 
        of our outgoings. Connecting to the internet is charged by the minute 
        due to it using the telephone lines. $10 a month is absolutely nothing, 
        when many Europeans have phonebills around or in excess of $200 per month 
        - the vast majority just for playing on UO. This makes this ORPG addiction 
        even more costly and much more of a desperate situation. You would be 
        hard pushed to find a European who macroed regularly, unless they were 
        amazingly wealthy or incredibly stupid. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been addicted to UO, 
        and then kicked the habit, and then picked it up again. I've been close 
        to completely cancelling my internet access before just to stop me from 
        playing these games and costing more money as the temptation to install 
        UO and just reactivate the account has been too much in the past. It may 
        sound pathetic and ignorant to many people, but I'm sure everyone in Europe 
        will understand exactly what I'm getting at with this. When you play, 
        you dont think about the money that it is costing on the phone bill - 
        that is pushed to the back of your head and you only think about it when 
        you check the phonebill and see the huge amounts that have mounted up. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, if it costs so much money 
        - then why bother playing? Without these games, what is left of the internet 
        that is entertaining for such lengths of time? You can read newsgroups, 
        post on a few message boards - but where does it get you in the end? You 
        never get the enjoyment, satisfaction and sense of fulfillment that you 
        can get from playing games and actually doing something worthwhile that 
        actively involves other people. After a while, all webpages start to look 
        the same and the whole novelty wears off (even hamsterdance). But with 
        the online games, there is always something that you have to keep going 
        back for. So why bother using the internet at all? Well, every one of 
        your readers is guilty of that. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The situation will only get 
        more serious for some people, and I predict that the online game will 
        cause huge problems for many people - and families. With the new consoles 
        coming out, internet gaming will be even more available for the most PC-illiterate 
        of people. The popularity of the internet is always growing with thousands 
        more people getting online every week. The steady release of ORPGs and 
        standard games with multiplayer support will encourage people to play, 
        and subsequently get addicted. Once you have started something with a 
        game, it is very hard just to drop it and say 'no more'. Adults and children 
        alike will start to play more, and run up huge bills due to this addiction, 
        potentially causing financial problems within families. But once you have 
        started, where do you get off? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The future will bring more 
        cases of this addiction, and until the rest of the world catches up with 
        the free internet access, alot of people are going to have alot of problems. 
        I've done my fair share of things in Ultima, running a successful RP'ing 
        group of Elves on Catskills, helping set up various player run towns, 
        running a website dedicated to the OSI Volunteer Programme, being GM of 
        2 player run shards... and only now is it all starting to finally dawn 
        on just how pointless it all is in the end. People who have the problem 
        really should look into the future - in 2 or 3 years time, what are you 
        going to have gained out of this all? It is very likely that you wont 
        have anything to show for it, apart from a few entries on your credit 
        card bill from OSI, sore eyes, a larger stomach and superb understanding 
        of everything to do with UO ever. Maybe then you will look back and see 
        how much time you wasted on something that gave you nothing but a few 
        hours of 'getting-away-from-it-all' an evening. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And a final piece of advice 
        for those who think they are having trouble getting away from it all - 
        your life is your own responsibility. No one else is going to force you 
        to stop and pull the plug out. If you want to do it - just pluck up the 
        courage, give your non-existant items away, delete your characters and 
        cancel your account. Without your characters there, the urge to reactivate 
        the account is much less. If you are happy as you are and dont care about 
        getting involved in an online world, then you can ignore everything you 
        just read :)</font></p>
