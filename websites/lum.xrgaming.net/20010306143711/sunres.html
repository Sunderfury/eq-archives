      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="2">Contrary 

        to what you may think, Lum doesn't really care how many people read his 

        page, although he is in fact an egotistical bastard who refers to himself 

        in the third person.</font></i></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the very first update I 

        filed on the SUN dupe/banning, I included the following request:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I challenge anyone in SUN 

          to come up with a logical explanation for why every single one of their 

          duping asses should not be immediately permabanned.</font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It took them actually all being 

        permabanned, but we now have that response. Go ahead and <a href="http://home.rochester.rr.com/na/index.htm" target="_blank">read 

        it,</a> &quot;with an open mind&quot; as they ask, then come back. I'll 

        wait.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unlike Janus, I <i>do</i> know 

        where to begin.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Responsibility.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's a big word, and it has 

        a big meaning. In life, we take responsibility for our actions. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SUN would like you to think 

        that no one knew exactly where those hundreds of thousands of arrows and 

        reagents were coming from. As Janus puts it:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Then I logged into the house 

          one day to find 50k arrows and 50 bolts on the floor. Not knowing who 

          or why I just jumped for joy at the large amount of resources. I took 

          a few hundred and went to kill airs. Of course I never made it there 

          and was quickly dispatched by Plug outside shame, but anyway. I asked 

          around and noone else knew where they came from, except one person. 

          This person at the time simply told me 'We cant dupe, but we found a 

          way to make a lot of money really easily. Dont worry about it.' And 

          thats exactly what I did... </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will give Janus the benefit 

        of the doubt and assume he is an intelligent person. Therefore, that rules 

        out that he thought that the Arrow Fairies and Mystical Reagent Gremlins 

        paid his new guild castle a visit. Obviously he knew they had to come 

        from somewhere. And, again, giving him the benefit of the doubt and assuming 

        that he does have a brain to call his own, he would know that there weren't 

        that many reagents on the entire shard, much less all happily sitting 

        in one tile.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will also assume that he 

        occasionally visited his own guild's IRC channel, where one of the guildmasters 

        gleefully bragged:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">FZuul> DUPING REWLZZZZZ 

          <br>

          FZuul> =) <br>

          FZuul> We even get our pictures on the boards doing it<br>

          Travis> Getting busted dont <br>

          FZuul> KEWL </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we'll assume that he wasn't 

        there for that little exchange either, that he really had no idea that 

        folks in his guild were duping, other than what any intelligent person 

        would deduce from things magically appearing. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Taking him at his word, he 

        knew all this; he just didn't choose to think about it. As he said later,</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Word was going around that 

          someone in SUN knew something we all didn't. But again, noone questioned, 

          noone to be quite honest CARED. If someone came up to you in the street 

          and handed you a 50 dollar bill. You, unless you are a complete moron, 

          would take the bill and spend it and say thank you. But, how were you 

          to know the bill was a forgery? </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not everyone takes candy from 

        strangers. Some of us do understand that every action has a consequence, 

        and that 50 dollar bill had to come from somewhere.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's called responsibility. 

        Knowing what the repercussions of your actions, and those of your friends, 

        may lead to. In this case, global banning. OSI certainly isn't secretive 

        about it. Gordon Walton, a ranking OSI executive, said as much during 

        a recent player lunch, and even used the player slang &quot;twinks&quot; 

        to refer to those exploiters who were causing Origin programmers to focus 

        their efforts on exploit prevention at the cost of in-game improvements. 

        Not to mention Origin's own website, which reads, in part:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15) You will not exploit 

          any bug in the Ultima Online product or the Ultima Online Service to 

          gain unfair advantage in the game and you will not communicate the existence 

          of any such bug (either directly or through public posting) to any other 

          user of the Ultima Online Service. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU 

          AGREE TO THESE RULES AND WILL ABIDE BY THEM. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THESE 

          RULES WILL APPLY TO ANYONE THAT YOU ALLOW TO USE YOUR ULTIMA ONLINE 

          ACCOUNT OR USER ID, AND THAT YOU ARE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 

          CONSEQUENCES (INCLUDING TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT) THAT MAY RESULT 

          IF ANY SUCH PERSON BREAKS THESE RULES. </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And again;</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The severity of the offense 

          and prior record of the player is taken into account, but some offenses 

          will cause immediate and permanent banning from the service. If a player 

          is doing something for which they can be banned, they probably know 

          it is wrong. Even if they don’t, they should. As part of the agreement 

          to play the game, players should keep up with our current rules and 

          regulations. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you find a loop hole which 

          allows you to duplicate items or create more gold, [this is] considered 

          an exploit. The rules have obviously been broken and unusual gains have 

          been made. Knowing what is an exploit is really a matter of knowing 

          how the game works. Ignorance that you were using an exploit will not 

          prevent removal from the game for committing such an exploit. </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ignorance of the law is no 

        excuse - the Seargeant Schultz &quot;I see NUUUU-thing!&quot; defense 

        hasn't ever held up in court, in Denmark or in America. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Janus' defense isn't that 

        he duped and didn't know the consequences - it's that he didn't know things 

        were being duped. He didn't ask questions - he just smiled and accepted 

        the hand that &quot;fate&quot; dealt him. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or, as he put it,</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can guarantee you that 

          noone in SUN besides maybe 3 people knew anything about this. It was 

          all hush hush until we were finally gated to the tower and given reggies. 

          Which, like I said before, we didn't question. Why would you? Would 

          you rat on your best friend? Would you risk getting yourself in trouble 

          to do the right thing and place blame on someone else? Would you cause 

          the eventually banning of your entire guild on purpose? People, mind 

          you, that have been severally close for a good 2.5 years? </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I won't even go into the literally 

        HUNDREDS of email I recieved yesterday when this was still going on, detailing 

        SUN's history of bug exploitation on Catskills. None of that is proven; 

        I'm sure they would already be banned were it so. We're dealing with facts 

        here. And the fact of the matter is that Janus, as he described it, benefited 

        from duped material. Here, he doesn't even try to feign ignorance - he 

        knew it was duped. His defense now is that &quot;you don't rat out your 

        friends&quot;.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, no, but you don't let 

        them make stupid mistakes that would have consequences for your entire 

        guild, either. And you don't blissfully help yourself to the proceeds 

        while remaining untainted. If your friend robs a bank, do you help him 

        spend the money, rationalizing that &quot;well, I can't turn him into 

        the cops, since he's my friend, so I may as well have some fun&quot;? 

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a legal term for that. 

        Accessory to the crime. You can't benefit from the proceeds of a crime 

        and remain innocent. You have become a criminal, by the act of benefiting 

        from that crime. You are as guilty as the people who duped the reagents 

        you happily, unquestioningly used.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And THAT is why you are banned, 

        and that is why 99.99% of the players of UO won't miss your duping, cheating, 

        antisocial guild for a second. But don't let me be biased or anything. 

        (More on that later.)</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, as SUN says, some innocent 

        folks may have been harmed by their actions. As Janus heartrenderingly 

        describes:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now all of SUN is banned, 

          including every computer and terminal at the Denmark net house. That 

          also means half of another catskills guild, and a good dozen people 

          that don't even play UO but use the cafe are also banned. Why? Because 

          OSI is like a child. </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Cloud mentioned in another 

        post (and despite what Janus would have you belief, the IP stamping of 

        COB postings don't lie; I'm told by someone in SUN's IRC that they panicked 

        and tried to disavow Cloud's postings as the net drew further down upon 

        them) a poor 10 year old kid who played from that Internet salon was also 

        banned. Damn OSI, runing the fun of a ten year old child!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Responsibility.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Origin didn't cause that kid 

        to be banned. YOU did. You and your guild did. You caused Origin to put 

        an IP block on the cybercafe you play from (which I'm sure amuses the 

        owner to no end). Your actions caused it. If you hadn't decided it would 

        be k3w1 to start duping up castles, that 10 year old kid would be playing 

        today. Maybe YOU should explain to him why he can't play any more. I'm 

        sure he would love to hear your justification of how Origin is really 

        a bunch of Nazis who hate PKs. And frankly, as one who has been red more 

        than once, I personally am sick and tired of exploiting idiots like you 

        who cause people to think ALL PKs exploit and cheat and are too weak-minded 

        and weak-willed to compete on an even playing field.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, as I said, I guess I'm 

        biased. As Janus reports:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following picture, posted 

          on the wonderfully non-biased 'Lum The Mad's' website, was a screen 

          shot taken from over a year ago from a tower on Catskills taken by a 

          member of the UDL. (Sidenote: Lum, I'm not sure how old you are. Nor 

          do I care. but your Journalistic style resembles that of a mix of 1950's 

          yellow journalism and a cheap semblance of 'The Globe'. Learn to print 

          BOTH sides of a story; WITHOUT cussing, WITHOUT personal opinion, and 

          WITH the facts. People don't care if you like/dislike SUN or anyone 

          for that matter. People want news, not rants on how unfair and unjust 

          life has been for you in UO (you poor, poor thing you). And before you 

          print something, get your damn facts straight. Do that on an internationally, 

          hell, even locally read newspaper and your ass would be so fired the 

          suicide prevention line would be calling YOU to see if your 'OK'. Twit.) 

          </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK. I'll use very small words.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is not a news site. This 

        is a rants site. Thus the words &quot;The Rantings of Lum The Mad&quot;. 

        These are opinions. My opinions. The whole point of the site isn't to 

        present unbiased news, but my commentary on them. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Guess what - even &quot;real 

        newspapers&quot; have those. They're called editorials. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If people want &quot;news, 

        not rants on how unfair and unjust life has been for you in UO&quot; (and 

        actually, things are going pretty peachy for me in UO, thanks for askin'), 

        they go to a - brace yourself - NEWS site. I know it's a difficult concept, 

        but work with me here.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And here's another newsflash 

        - you think this is &quot;1950's yellow journalism&quot;? Thanks. Glad 

        to see someone recognized the influence. This site never aspires to be 

        anything other than &quot;The Drudge Report of UO&quot;. And despite that, 

        people seem to want to read it on occasion. Go figure.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(As for the faked tower screenshot, 

        a later posting explained how it was in fact faked, but let's not let 

        facts get in the way of a good rant. After all, I don't.)</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Allow me to clarify this 

          one for you Lum...You are correct. The website was taken down by Simkin. 

          Do you want to know why? Because thanks to you posting the URL to the 

          hundreds of consciously inept people that do before they think, many 

          members of SUN (via the roster) have been e-mail bombed, death threatened, 

          spammed, cussed, or just plain harassed to no end. Now, I don't know 

          much about computer fraud, or any laws thereof, but posting someone's 

          e-mail address so others can go harass them has to be breaking something. 

          Personally, I know my ISP takes legal action against mail spammers on 

          their servers. Although taking down the website wasn't the first...Thanks 

          to you also posting our messageboard address, we had a good number of 

          people coming to flame the hell out of us without so much as a notion 

          that 'maybe SUN's innocent'. </font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nice. Problem is, I never posted 

        SUN's website URL or message board. By the time I updated, they were already 

        taken down. But, again, far be it for the facts to get in the way! Continue!</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now on to a more personal 

          note that just plain pissed the fuck out of me. Not because it incriminates 

          me in any way, but because of you made out to be. The following was 

          'cut and paste' from a conversation with FZuul that (just so happened) 

          was posted on your page within 5 minutes of it's speaking:</font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note: I wasn't the one who 

        pulled the &quot;log on as FZuul&quot; stunt. As you saw, when I log onto 

        IRC channels, I'm egotistical enough to log in under my own name. </font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, I'm so glad you posted 

          this without consulting me first. Essentially what you posted served 

          nothing more than to fuel the fire and incriminate me. The PURPOSE of 

          me msging FZuul in the first place, was for him to change his nic so 

          as to not get harassed and msg spammed by the 'GM' that mysteriously 

          found our channel. FZuul is a friend of a loooong time, as is all of 

          SUN, thereby I look out for them. As any of you would do for any clanmate, 

          and don't sit there and deny it because you know you would. But in any 

          case, thanks for making me out to be a sneaky underhanded sunuvabitch.</font></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You're welcome. I guess being 

        in a guild of dupers and cheaters wasn't enough to label you as a &quot;sneaky 

        underhanded sunavabitch&quot;, glad I could do my part. And no, I didn't 

        consult you first. Possibly because I had no idea who you were. Go figure.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, it should be painfully 

        obvious that I don't like your guild. Gee. I guess it's only because I 

        belong to a PvP guild on the same shard who plays by the rules. Wonder 

        why I would be pissed off. Hmm. Haven't a clue. Nope.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In closing Janus posts an inspiring 

        motto:</font></p>

      <blockquote>

          Fuel the fire and get burned. </font></p>
