        is my abbreviated although somewhat word-for-word transcript of the Q 
        &amp; A that followed the lunch. The first question was asked by this 
        guy pictured to the right and pretty much set the tone for the entire 
        afternoon:</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6">WHY DID YOU SCREW 
        UP ALL THE SMITHS?</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: Uh.... we didn't?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Why am I getting 100% packet 
        loss when on a cable modem while connected to Atlantic?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GM Gabriel: Send a tracelog 
        to uotrace@owo.com and they'll see what's up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: I saw &quot;We will be revamping 
        Order and Chaos&quot; on the Update Center. What does &quot;revamping&quot; 
        mean?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: Lots of people don't 
        like the side effects of Order/Chaos wars such as huge piles of dead bodies 
        in town, so we will be looking at ways to impact the effect of Order/Chaos 
        on others. Nothing is planned immediately.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: What about necromancy, alchemy, 
        player races...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: (interrupts) THERE 
        WILL NEVER BE PLAYER RACES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS! STOP! STOP! STOP!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LadyMOI: We will be updating 
        the UO web sites with more detailed progress on outstanding issues.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: What about server-side lag, 
        and are there any plans for dealing with network congestion and upgrading 
        UO's network?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: Server-side lag is 
        caused by exploiters and &quot;twinks&quot; - I used that word, you can 
        quote me - who use exploits to cheat in the game. We are working to fix 
        these. As we eliminate exploits, server-side lag will decrease. As for 
        network congestion, we are upgrading our equipment constantly to meet 
        demand, but the Internet itself is congested, and no matter what network 
        provider we choose, two months later they will become screwed up. Much 
        of the problem involves network peering <i>(a technical term which indicates 
        the practice of network providers sharing bandwidth - Lum)</i> and we 
        work with our network providers as much as possible and try to choose 
        those who do not rely on peering. You can help by sending us your UOTrace 
        logs as we use those logs as leverage when dealing with our server providers. 
        We are also working on methods in game to reduce reliance on network latency 
        but that will take some time. However, 80 to 90% of network congestion 
        is out of our control and pretty much all we can do is jump up and down 
        and scream.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: What happened to Chesapeake? 
        After the promised upgrades it didn't seem too different from the problems 
        we suffered last week. Any news on this?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calandryll: I don't know anything 
        right now; I'll check back at the office and with other Chesapeake players 
        Monday and report back to you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Will we get the ability 
        to resmelt used armor into ingots?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: Let me answer this 
        one... Yes!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: I love this guy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Well, when is it coming?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: I'm not going to say 
        THAT!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Well, is it going to be 
        like necromancy?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: No!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Well, what about alchemy?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: Yes!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: When?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: Later!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lum: This makes it awfully 
        easy for me to take notes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: Seriously, with Necromancy 
        and Alchemy, we need to do a considerable amount of research into the 
        possible effect of such radical gameplay changes on the game world. Do 
        you really want hundreds of potions dumped into the world with no thought 
        as to how they effect play balance? We want to move forward carefully. 
        We have over 135,000 sets of expectations to meet. We are reacting to 
        problems in the current service, while adding new features at the same 
        time. It's a difficult process.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Is Siege Perilous going 
        to have necromancy and alchemy updated at the same time as the other servers?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: Even though Siege Perilous 
        has different rules from other shards, Siege will be updated with the 
        same updates as the other servers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: What about forgetfulness 
        potions for skill management? Could those be added sooner?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: Should we discuss that?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: We will implement skill 
        management soon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Will any new land be opened 
        up for housing soon?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: No comment! However, 
        small houses are being placed every day on every shard. It does take effort 
        and leg work to find a place to place a house, but it is possible. We 
        are now tracking on every shard how many houses are placed daily and what 
        type.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: The update center hasn't 
        been updated in quite a while with what is being worked on. Why?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calandryll: We will update 
        those parts of the web site soon. As a result of the recent &quot;changing 
        of the guard&quot;, we are assigning personal responsibilities for each 
        part of the web site and you should see much more updates very soon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Now that macroing is under 
        control, will skill gain be made easier?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: We're not planning on 
        doing anything immediately.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LadyMOI: If you have any thoughts 
        on this or anything else, email us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: What about house auctions?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: Yes! (I'm following Gordon's 
        lead.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q (from Lum): What about UO2? 
        I know that probably no one here is working on it, but will players be 
        allowed input into the design process as it moves forward?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: What's UO2?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LadyMOI: We don't have any 
        idea what you're talking about.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(entire OSI team whistles and 
        looks at the ceiling)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Will anything be done about 
        bandages being so much heavier than the cloth they are cut from?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: Bandages are covered 
        in antiseptic. They're really heavy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: What about veteran quests? 
        Will they be more interesting than the newbie quests currently being beta 
        tested?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: They will be be much 
        different from newbie quests. Possibly something like go find this sword 
        to kill this monster to get this treasure. We hope to have the ability 
        to have people going to multiple towns.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: Most issues involve 
        enabling players to run quests and events. We are preparing to give new 
        tools to Seers and IGMs <i>(Interest Game Masters - GMs who run OSI events 
        on shards - Lum) </i>so that they can be empowered to build quests to 
        order. The creativity of players will always be greater than anything 
        we can come up with.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: I'm a PK on Siege. (<i>in 
        response to my question, he told me he had an Archery of 80 and a Tactics 
        of 65) </i>I get fatigued on my horse long before I would on foot, since 
        I can eat fish steaks to regenerate stamina. Are there any plans to fix 
        this? Everyone outruns me when I pursue them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: There are no plans to 
        change horses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: I remember when there would 
        be monster invasions of towns - the town cryer would announce that, say, 
        Trinsic would be under attack, the guards would be turned off there and 
        the screen would just be filled with wall-to-wall orc mages. Those were 
        some of the best events ever run in UO, and they just stopped. What happened?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gordon: As I said, we are currently 
        restructuring the Seer/IGM program and you should see many more events 
        after this happens.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calandryll: Also, events happen 
        often now; you should check the Town Cryer and other news sites for details.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Here's a suggestion for 
        housing - why not when placing a house make it so that the house shadow 
        highlights when placing it? And making it so that ferns and blades of 
        grass don't block placing a house?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toad: I'm not working on housing 
        right now.</font></p>

        the meeting devolved into anarchy as everyone fought over the best way
