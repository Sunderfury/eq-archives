  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">E3 2000 can be summed up in this 
    one picture.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="pr0n.jpg" width="448" height="480"></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now all you people bitching at 
    me because I never take pictures of lesbian sex when I come across it - there 
    it is, big as life, smack on the Jumbotron. And not as many as you think are 
    paying attention. They're tired, they're drunk, the synapses have been fused 
    into a mass of glass, people have been trying to tell them all week what really 
    important video games are being worked on, they want to go home.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yes, that really is lesbian 
    sex on the Jumbotron. And yes, LoH saw it. I'm not sure what made her more 
    angry; looking up and seeing 75 foot high Catholic school girls fiddling with 
    each other's nether bits, or seeing the line of kids peeking underneath the 
    tarp looking up at the 75 foot high Catholic school girls. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then again, there are the other 
    highlights to E3. Here are probably the two coolest people even vaguely associated 
    with online entertainment, and I got them both in one picture - <a href="http://www.seanbaby.com/">Seanbaby</a> 
    and <a href="http://cos.xrgaming.net/apocrypha/">Balseraph</a>.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not telling you which one is which, 
    either. Although Seanbaby told me he actually does read this site, which made 
    me giggle like a little schoolgirl. I'm pretty sure Balseraph reads it too. 
    So I'm just confused. Anyway, there's both of them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Started the day doing the UO2 demo/conveyor 
    belt (&quot;Please keep your hands, feet and questions inside the blue lines 
    at all times&quot;) and moseyed on over to the Verant booth. Unfortunately 
    my camera puked all over itself around the time I was madly snapping pictures 
    of LESBIAN PR0N and in some sort of karmic retribution erased both the photos 
    of Starr &quot;Blackthorne of Borg&quot; Long doing the crrrrrrraw in front 
    of the McFarlane Toys display and of the Everquest booth all displaying &quot;YOU 
    HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED&quot; messages on huge display screens. Disconnection 
    was basically the order of the day; although I had scheduled an appointment 
    with John &quot;Vito&quot; Smedley and Brad &quot;Visionquest&quot; McQuaid, 
    Smedley was MIA and McQuaid was stuck signing autographs since Keith Parkinson, 
    the Everquest/noted fantasy artist was stranded in an airport somewhere. No 
    word on if anyone asked &quot;who the hell is B. McQuaid and what did he do 
    with Keith Parkinson?&quot;. Hell, everyone there was probably Evercrack junkies 
    anyway. I did get the chance to (a) look at Sovereign, which looked like lots 
    of numbers and very primitive yet oddly cool-looking graphics and (b) bop 
    Brad McQuaid on the head with a rolled-up Keith Parkinson poster and scream 
    &quot;YOU MADE MY WIFE LOOK LIKE THAT!&quot;. He then ran away which pretty 
    much made any further interviewing impossible. Please note that I am making 
    absolutely none of this up (especially the LESBIAN PR0N).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finished out E3 resting my dead 
    feet, and hanging out at the GODGames booth since they had scantily clad midgets, 
    Shadowbane developers, free drinks, and, of course, LESBIAN PR0N. You really 
    could not ask for more from life. Well, except the chance to ply UO2 developers 
    with drinks and then get them to talk on the record about all sorts of things, 
    which is how we spent the evening. It made for an interesting discussion, 
    especially when Ubiq discussed what the 3D0 people managed to do with one 
    million spare little army men when bored late at night (hint: think marching 
    columns).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Highlight of the show? I bet you 
    think I'm gonna say Lesbian Pr0n. No, you can get that anywhere (well, most 
    anywhere). Really the highlight w</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">as 
    in just meeting a dizzying amount of people -- developers, webmasters, writers, 
    even some Russian guy who I spent an hour arguing the finer points of immigration 
    policy with for no apparent reason. My brain feels full. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In terms of games: Anarchy Online 
    is going to hit 2000 like a fairly large nuclear warhead. The year after that 
    we'll see Shadowbane and Ultima Online 2, both of which are appealing to similar 
    yet somewhat different markets (and are <i>very </i>different games). After 
    that? Haven't a clue, but I suspect in 2002 there will be a trade show <b>just</b> 
    for online games. Which will be good, because I can safely assume that it 
    will <b>not</b> be in Los Angeles - the lowlight of the show. GOD I hate Los 
    Angeles. There is nothing more relaxing then driving down Santa Monica Boulevard, 
    and having your passengers point out all the gay male botique shops.</font></p>
