<b>Issues in Online Multi-Player Game Development<br>
An Essay for Developers by <a href="mailto:delusion@smart.net">Delusion</a></b><br>

of grief.</a></font></i></font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Verdana">This represents the design goals I believe would create
a new and satisfying step forward in the genre of multi-player online
role-playing games. Direct examples from Ultima Online, Asheron's Call,
Everquest, and other games may be helpful in illustrating specific examples.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Although I write this with the game developer in mind,
it may be valuable for players as well.&nbsp; Too often, I think we as gamers
get used to the status quo and leave it to the game developers to ask the big
questions, like &quot;What's next?&quot;.&nbsp; If we don't want the next
generation of MRPGs to be about cybersex, eBay, credit cards, camping, and
laser-toting elves in leather bikinis, we'd best be prepared to figure out what
we <strong>do</strong> want them to be about, and to do that, we have to address
you, the developers, before you've made your most basic decisions about your
game.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Scale</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A playing environment in this sort of game can, in my
opinion, probably not be too big. Ultima Online, a couple of years after
release, feels positively cramped, even on a new server. Asheron's Call features
a world that is vast in comparison. Even so, Asheron's Call will no doubt feel
smaller a year from now than it currently does, and honestly, it's shrinking
fast as the number of portal-casting item mages increase.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">There's more to size than &quot;length times
height&quot;. Teleportation plays a major role in how &quot;big&quot; a world
seems. UO offers instantaneous travel to anyone who really wants it, whether by
direct casting of the recall or gate spells, or through the purchase of recall
scrolls to use on a collection of purchased runes. To get from a popular city on
one end of the map to another popular city instantly is trivial. In AC, the
flexibility of instant transportation is greatly reduced (especially for lower
level and melee characters who do not or never intend to add item magic to their
skillset). The ability to gate to a specific location requires more of a time
investment in AC than in UO - if you need any proof of this, compare the bribes
and rewards offered by other players for gating someone from Arwic to Fort
Tethana as opposed to a gate from Britain to Vesper, as well as the frequency of
the asking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In addition to spell-based teleportation, it's built
into the game environment itself. In UO, moongates stand outside each of the
major cities like bus terminals for those who can't cast recall, as well as
certain other instant teleportation locales. In AC, there is a network of one-
and two-way portals. There are few locations that are far out of reach of a
portal, so with a little searching around on various player web sites, you can
find tools that make short trips out of the most lengthy overland runs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><em>What if a game had no means of instant
teleportation?</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The most obvious effect is that the perceived size of
the play environment would seem much larger. There are advantages to this; more
so if the play environment IS actually bigger. Making a &quot;distributed
world&quot; is possible, too: rather than have several identical servers, each
server would be different and players could travel between them, though the
travel should be difficult. This may not be practical at all, if players tend to
congregate in one area of your world, and leave other areas empty. Detail to the
proper distribution of adventuring, socializing, and encounter locales might be
able to offset this &quot;clumping&quot; effect.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Economy</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Player-run economy&quot; and &quot;virtual
economy&quot; are often listed as design goals in multi-player online games.
Economy without locality is hard to achieve. Locality is one of the reasons
players create their own spaces for trading - whether that be a cluster of
player-run vendors in a player-run town outside a city in UO, or a weekly swap
meet in an Allegiance Hall outside a city in AC. For other players, locality
isn't necessarily a goal, but a side effect. Whatever the motivations of
players, locality and economy stimulate one another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">An instructive example taken from history is the town
market concept. In medieval Europe (and in some cities, before then), many
cities would set a 'market day' for people to peddle their goods. Some sleepy
English villages grew into major cities thanks to being early adopters of this
concept. Market day still exists to a certain degree, I certainly saw it in
England during my time there: it was important to the community. The positive
community effects of this arrangement are nowhere near as strong now as they
used to be, as market day competes with the economy of scale when a shopping
plaza or mega-store opens up nearby. Although the benefits of community versus
convenience is a contemporary issue, it's not exclusively so. Regardless of how
we feel this plays out in real life, I think it's pretty clear that community is
good for the stability and longevity of online games, whether that be community
out of the game in the &quot;extended play-space&quot; of player web sites and
guilds, or a group of players who get used to seeing one another in-game. In the
realm of gaming, the &quot;mega-store&quot; mode of economy (such as buying from
anonymous NPC vendors who are always stocked with the same items) is less
beneficial to the game itself than a player-driven economy: there's less value
added when Jim's character gets used to buying from Jane the NPC than when he
gets used to haggling a price with Fred's character, and the two start trading
with each other regularly, each adding value to the other's experience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">I call this &quot;local economy&quot;. It's an important
concept that most online games haven't embraced. The game design itself can lend
to local economy. Though none of the current games really attempts a local
economy, there's a slight difference between UO and AC that is instructive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In UO, game currency gold pieces are rather constant.
Characters store them in a bank, and those funds are available to them from any
other bank. Some NPCs selling large-ticket items withdraw directly from
characters' banks. To be in Britain and buy a house from a merchant in Vesper, a
player simply ensures his or her character has the funds in that character's
bank account (which of course follows that character wherever it goes in the
game), then travels to Vesper - be it on foot or through teleportation - and
makes the purchase there. Players suffer no real inconvenience or loss by
travelling to Vesper and making their purchases than you would if they had
purchased it anywhere else.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In AC, game currency pyreals are still constant. Unlike
UO, though, characters have no banks. Instead, they have a secondary currency:
trade notes. If someone wants a 10,000 pyreal trade note (which represents a sum
too heavy to be burdened with for any length of time), the character pays 11,000
pyreals to an NPC. The 1,000 difference is a money-changing fee, and it feels to
many players like a service tax, which it is. If the character dies, about half
of the pyreals carried in hand are lost, but trade notes are never lost. So
instead of UO's secure bank, AC has something closer to a secure wallet. When
the character sells that 10,000 pyreal note, the original NPC who sold it will
purchase it back for 10,000 - any other NPC will give 8,000. Instead of a 9%
loss, a 27% loss. The effect this has on characters is somewhat subtle, but it
confers a definite financial advantage to having a place to call
&quot;home&quot; in the game. This is especially true for those without item
magic teleportation. I feel the effects would be more pronounced on the
player-base if there were more big-ticket items to purchase in AC, but even
without it, it does encourage a small degree of local economy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">If unlimited storage banks have a negative effect on
local economy, unlimited storage banks that a character can access from any
city, such as is the model of UO banks, is even worse. If you're going to allow
players to have what amounts to a safe deposit box, there should be a game
currency cost for this service per month, and if it's not a fixed amount of
storage, the price should increase as the weight increases, and should be based
on the highest weight amount held per month. For instance, it might cost 3
silver shillings per month if the maximum weight of the box in the month was 5
pounds, but putting in a 100 pound suit of armor in the box (in this case, more
like a locker), even for the briefest of moments, would raise the cost to 75
silver shillings for that month.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">For currency banks, access to funds should be limited to
the bank in which funds were deposited. Most banks will probably limit currency
deposit to the currency of that realm: currency from other lands will be
accepted at the normal exchange rate, minus a fee. Some border and port towns
may allow different currency deposits or waive the fee, reflecting a more
cosmopolitan economy. A modest interest, perhaps 1% to 5% per month, may provide
a decent trade-off for this extra layer of interaction. To avoid money transfer
exploits, this interest should be calculated on the minimum balance for the
month. With this additional source of money, it becomes important to ensure that
there are plenty of good reasons to spend it. A minimum balance of 10,000 units,
kept for 12 months and never withdrawn generates 1,157 units in revenue at the
end of the 12th months at a 1% rate, and generates 7,103 units in revenue at the
end of the 12th month at a 5% rate. Rates could even be different (and possibly
even fluctuate) in different banks to reflect the strength of different nations
and local economies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><em>What if a game had no means of instant
teleportation? What if each major city had its own currency?</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The game engine itself would encourage local economy.
Computer-controlled monsters and NPCs might have a mix of raw metals (and not
just gold), and local currencies with an emphasis on the currency dominant in
the nearest civilized lands. There would be fluctuating exchange rates based on
the influx of materials into a given kingdom. The exchange rates would hit
hardest those who had the most money and freedom to travel: successful player
characters. An enterprising character might be willing to give you 240 gold
Thujan crowns for your 2,000 copper plugs from the next kingdom over instead of
the 216 that the NPC-controlled Commodity Exchange offers. What happens when the
local silver mine dries up? The currency of the Free City of Harborstone might
start using a lower fineness of silver for its silver doubloons, making them
worth less in exchange. This complicates matters with the neighboring
Principality of Bara, since Harborstone doubloons and those of Bara used to be
created similarly and exchanged on par. The Prince might loose patience with the
situation, and finally have a means of convincing the Mercantile Guild to
support incorporation of the Free City into the Principality, by force if
necessary.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Trade</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">With local economy, and certain areas producing
different raw materials and trade goods than others, trade inevitably follows.
Trade between nations, trade between cities, trade between guilds, etc. - some
controlled by the game political engine and NPCs, some controlled by player
characters. In a world without instant transportation, how do goods get from the
buyer to the seller? They travel by land and sea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">This implies merchant fleets and caravans. By merchant
fleets, I don't mean a boat like in UO where one person can stuff five tons of
metal armor on his one-man 30 foot sailboat and get it from point Trinsic to
Ocllo himself. By caravans, I don't mean a 200 strength runner like in AC
carrying 4 complete suits of Amuli armor from Glenden Wood to his guild-mates in
Cragstone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Since our ideal world is a big place where travel
doesn't occur with a wiggle of the nose, let's assume a land-based caravan going
from one city to another. These two cities are at opposite ends of a
medium-sized nation, and perhaps that's a journey that covers one twentieth
(1/20) of the distance on the map, and it's either a straight east-west or
north-south line. For comparison purposes, one twentieth of the map in a
straight line is half the width of UO's Britain, or in AC, the distance between
Nanto and Mayoi. Our ideal world is much larger. Since these two cities are at
opposite ends of a medium sized nation, let's assume that's a distance roughly
equal to the distance between AC's Holtburg and Qalaba'r. I can't easily put
that into UO terms, because that distance would be the equivalent of running
from the southern tip of the main continent to Vesper many times over. In AC, as
a single character with decent run, a flat out run without teleporting would
take up two hours or so, I believe. A caravan doesn't &quot;run&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><em>What happens on this caravan from Bylayve to Atsetal
as it travels the lands of the Kingdom of Estova? What attracts various sorts of
players?</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A merchant character might be looking to earn a profit
by purchasing steel from the mountain town of Bylayve and selling it to the
shipwrights in the harbor city of Atsetal, and then purchase glassworks there
for the return trip.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A guild captain might be looking to get a large shipment
of weapons and armor purchased from the smiths of Bylayve to replace the current
guild finery, and from Atsetal, board one of the guild ships for the final leg
of the journey home, where his followers are eagerly waiting for replacement of
the sub-standard chain mail they'd been using before the guild's newfound
success.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The caravan consists of ten horse-drawn carts. Four
carry the steel shipment of the merchant. Two carry the finished arms and armor
of the guild captain. Other carts are owned by other player characters and NPCs
who only have one cart of goods, or who share part of a cartload with others..
Several of the people on the journey are riding their own horses - in fact, the
merchant has hired a bored NPC to ride an extra horse he picked up in Bylayve:
he wants to swap out horses for his steel carts, since they're a little heavier
than a single horse can carry for that length of time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Three of the other carts are owned by NPC
representatives of the Mercantile Guild of Estova, and they have two
representatives along on the journey. These two NPCs and the merchant and guild
captain discuss safety before leaving, and decide to hire a squadron of
mercenaries as a security detail for the trip. The mercenaries need to be paid,
and if any bandits (or worse) are encountered, their standard contract gives
them rights to plunder looted from these adversaries after damages have been
paid to anyone losing part of their shipments. For their trouble, they'll take 3
gold Estova sovereigns per day, rounded up. There are eight of them, and the
journey is expected to last four hours. They round up, so the caravan leader
will need to pay them 24 gold sovereigns at Atsetal. The caravan leader has
dealt with the mercenary leader before, and they trust each other, so the
caravan leader pays him 16 in advance. This is a contract between players, and
not a part of the game's interface, as PCs are involved on both sides.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">What the PCs involved in the caravan aren't aware of is
that the mercenaries will actually be needed. There's a hostile nomadic tribe
heading through the area that the caravan doesn't know about, and a straggling
group of them will cross the caravan's path. They don't like the King, and they
blame his people for the murder of their chief. Fortunately, the hunting party
the caravan encounters number only three, and one falls to his death during the
brief skirmish. When the caravan stops for water, two of the mercenaries need to
make camp for the day as their players' log out - they'll get half-pay from the
mercenary leader the next time he sees them, that reduces the caravan leader's
cost by 8 sovereigns, which means the 16 already paid is payment in full. Of
course, the caravan's risk is increased on the rest of the trip.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Obviously, an online role-playing game needs more than
merchants and heroes. What other sorts are served by a caravan?</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Travelers from one area to another who are not able
    to travel the route alone, have non-combatants, or who are travelling in a
    much more dangerous area than they're used to: everyone travels.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Confidence men and nomads. Those accustomed to living
    on the periphery of society, gypsy-types, shady businessmen who need to
    leave town before word gets out.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Assassins, road gangs, opportunists. Some might try
    to infiltrate the caravan, others might want to ambush it, try to overrun it
    when it's vulnerable at night, and others might have a specific target in
    mind. Of course, some may be crazed killers, but more about justice later.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Monsters. Whatever your definition of 'monster', an
    attack on a caravan at 3:1 odds might be attractive. Intelligent civilized
    monsters might be attracted to wealth, and simple lumbering beasts might
    pass up a caravan completely if it doesn't smell of food.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana">NPCs - nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd. NPCs
    would have the same sets of motivations as characters would to join a
    caravan.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Time</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">If the current crop of online role-playing games has
taught us anything about time, it's that trying to compete with Earth time is a
waste of time. Players don't use the in-game calendar to schedule events: it's
unwieldy, it generally has no connection to real time, and there's no way to
keep track of it out of game.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Whatever is done, time needs to follow an Earth
standard, regardless of what names you call the months and days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In a truly large world, the time of day should not be a
universal constant. One side of a spherical world should be light, and the other
should be day. If tied to a 24-hour day, this poses an interesting dilemma to
players: If they usually play at the same time of day, they might choose to live
in a part of the world where it's always 'day' during their play time. Or if
they're villains, or &quot;wanted&quot; in their country, they might be best
served by living where it's night during their playtime.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">That's poses some unusual considerations. A better
solution might be to have a 48 hour or a 12 hour daylight cycle in-game. As has
been said before, tying to &quot;real&quot; time is necessary: if you don't do
it as a developer, your players will do it for you. If you have a 48 hour
daylight schedule, you may have to come up with an in-game reason the populace
of the fantasy world keep track of time in increments other than rotations on
its axis. The standard list of fantasy reasons come to mind, such as a planet
that slowed down to half its rotation speed, evil magic, a disruption in
space/time; keeping to a more &quot;practical&quot; reason might be more useful.
Other than the daylight cycle, the yearly cycle, and the lunar cycle, human time
is completely arbitrary and based on custom (the concept of 'hours' is related
to Catholic monastic schedules of the Dark Ages, for instance) rather than laws
of physics or mathematics. The more extreme faction of the French Revolution
proposed a &quot;day&quot; of 10 daylight hours and 10 nighttime hours, each
divided into 100 metric minutes. I only use this as an example of the
fungibility of time: if you have a 48 hour daylight schedule, keep track in 24
hour days and throw the discrepancy to historical and social custom rather than
crazy magic or weird planetary motion.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">What is &quot;Offline&quot;?</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Proper treatment of offline time takes care of many
issues: travel, trade skills, and sleep not the least of them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A player log in his or her character, plays for a long
session, say eight hours on a rainy weekend. When the player is logged in, the
player's in control in control. Then you player logs off. What happens to the
character?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">It's certainly not reasonable to assume that the
character just stands (or sleeps) there until the next time the player's ready
to play. Surely the character had better things to do than to stand next to a
bed at the inn during the six days the player went on vacation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">What if players could utilize the offline time and
assign tasks? Given a proper progressive skill system, you could make offline
time more valuable than the macroing which otherwise might take place.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A player's character should be able to do things when
the player isn't minding him or her*. For one thing, the character must sleep.
That's merely the most obvious thing to do after eight hours of heart-pounding
combat, especially for those swinging a 50 pound two-handed steel blade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">What about those characters engaged in trade skills?
&quot;Playing&quot; a blacksmith character in a role-playing game seems like an
absurdity. Crafting a chain mail surcoat is an exacting task that requires many
many hours of work, a high level of skill, and is a job, not a hobby. Creating
ten plate mail leggings in 20 minutes stretches credulity beyond repair. More to
the point, blacksmithy, bowyery, carpentry and the like aren't
&quot;entertainment&quot;, they're things characters do for a living - what's
more, they shouldn't be means of &quot;instant gratification&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Deciding how characters spend offline time would be more
realistic, and could be used to replace a lot of the multiple-click tedium of
current online role-playing game trade skills. Clicking 1000 times to make 10
plate chests in 1 hour is neither realistic nor entertaining. Instead, when a
player logs off, the player should be able to choose how the character should
spend that time. This can either be a simple selection, or preferably a
customizable scheduler.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Choices as to how characters spend offline time should
be diverse</font>.
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>Weapons training</strong>. Eight hours of
    actual combat should remain much more effective than eight hours of offline
    training with a sword master, but given the choice between having a
    character do nothing and having a character sweat it out in a training
    barracks, the choice should be obvious.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>Stats training</strong>. In a stats-based
    game, it might be appropriate to allow a temporary (or permanent in some
    cases) boost to statistics for offline time dedicated to self improvement. A
    period of offline time devoted to practicing public speaking might raise a
    &quot;personality&quot; stat by ten points for an eight hour period.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>Travel</strong>. In a huge world, this is an
    excellent way to make travel more equitable. Allow characters to choose
    where they wish to log in, and base the radius of their eligible choices by
    the amount of time they've been logged off. In order to lessen &quot;flee
    exploits&quot;, allow any character who has been offline for more than four
    hours to choose where he or she logs in. A character who has been offline
    for five hours should have a smaller radius of login choices than a
    character who has been offline for 24 hours. A character that's been
    engaging in weapons training should have a smaller login radius than a
    character that's been practicing fishing, since you can fish intermittently
    as you travel. A character that's been engaging in blacksmithy may have to
    &quot;give up&quot; some of the offline time for his skill if he wishes to
    instantly travel when he logs in, since blacksmithy keeps a practitioner in
    a specific workplace. In order not to diminish the value of overland trade
    travel, characters specifying a new login point should be required to travel
    relatively light on their way there or deal with very limiting radius
    reductions if weighted down.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>Trade skills</strong>. Any such trade skill
    where high-quality crafted items or bulk consumables are created by an
    artisan is applicable. Allow offline time to be non-consecutive: If a full
    suit of plate armor takes 80 hours to construct, players should be able to
    devote time to it as they see fit, and finishing once they've accumulated 80
    hours. If they want to create a true signature piece and have the skills and
    supplies to do so, maybe another eight hours might be required to add
    enameling, engraving, or a more difficult design. Likewise, allow a
    carpenter to make more chairs or axe handles in 16 hours than in eight.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>Spell research</strong> and <strong>Language
    training. </strong>More on this later.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>Exploration. </strong>Again, more on this
    later.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana">You don't want to encourage offline benefits to the
extent that being logged in is less profitable (either in terms of monetary gain
or character building) than staying logged out, but you do want to make the
benefits greater than eight hours of macroing. This can be done by offering
offline options (such as trade skills) that can only be utilized in this offline
time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">You also want to cap this activity, scaling it so that
benefits don't accumulate after a certain amount of time, such as 48 hours.
Requiring two hours of login time before re-setting offline use would be good,
too, to reduce the practice of &quot;refreshing&quot; on behalf of friends.
Travel time should probably be the only offline ability to accumulate after this
arbitrary time period: someone gone for a few weeks should probably be able to
log in at any civilized area they could otherwise physically get to when they
next log in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A good customizable scheduler would be at the heart of
this system. Players should be able to direct their characters' offline time as
they choose, and distribute it as they choose, assigning different priorities.
Players will want to develop a system of priorities to make the best use of
their character's offline time, using a graphically based interface, some of
which might be superficially similar to UO's skill lock interface. For example:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Frank won't be able to play for three days for
  whatever reason. He wants his character Alyan to accomplish some tasks while
  offline. Alyan is a would-be knight, and is currently a squire. Frank sets
  Alyan's first priority: practice training with a horseman's flail until his
  skill has improved five points. Alyan's second priority is to travel from the
  stable in Windheim to the stable in Cheltham, and lodge his horse there.
  Alyan's third priority is to complete a bronze sword he's working on: he has
  four hours to go. It won't be a great sword given Alyan's low ability in this
  field, but it will cost him 100 reales less to make one than to buy one just
  as good. After that, Alyan's last priority is to hunt small game and sell the
  hides, which isn't great money, but brings in a few dozen reales. The first
  tasks are expected to take up about 16 hours of offline time, and the last one
  will continue until the offline max is reached. Of course, if Frank logs in
  earlier than expected, the offline schedule is interrupted, but may be
  continued upon logoff. Frank may either continue with the existing schedule,
  change it, or make a new one entirely.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana">* The remaining question would be &quot;when the
character is logged off and doing things offline, does that character appear in
the world?&quot;. While remaining in the world might be an interesting
challenge, players should have control over the appearance and demeanor of their
characters. With that as a design goal, leaving the PC to wander around (even if
invulnerable) would be an undesirable loss of player control. A player's friends
shouldn't have to guess if a player's character is &quot;manned&quot; or not.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Spell Research</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">With a highly diverse spell selection, researching magic
becomes a possibility. UO had no spell research program, EQ had the beginnings
of one, and AC went a little further in this regard, adding random reagents to
the process.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A big world would be complimented by a broad range of
magic, and research as a &quot;doorway&quot; to these spells is a valid factor
that serves to regulate the distribution of high power magic. A magic research
system like AC's serves to delay the acquisition of spells rather than truly
regulate their distribution. A spell system in a current online role-playing
game should be wide enough to incorporate several different types of magic. Many
(if not all) magic systems should be dependent on research.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">With offline spell research for all but the more basic
spells, you can have a great deal of control over how spells are allocated, and
more interestingly, dynamically add new ones without having to plug in complex
reagent formulae which merely serve to delay the inevitable. You can add a
powerful new spell, and specify the level/skill required to properly research
it. You can further specify that only a finite number of people per server can
learn it per week, or limit it to those researching it in a particular nation,
or characters of a particular religion or ethic belief.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The player should have options on offline spell
research, such as choosing a certain class of magic (cleric prayers, wizard
spells, druid-style ceremonial magic, voodoo-like fetish magic, whatever), and
perhaps &quot;directing&quot; the nature of the research. Directing research
toward &quot;offense spells&quot; should make discovering new magic less likely,
but increase the odds of getting an offensive combat spell considerably. The
more narrowly defined the spell type (cleric prayer defensive healing magic, or
conjurer ceremony creature summoning, for example), the more focused the
research should be - less likely to get magic, but more likely to get exactly
what it is the player is looking for if magic is found.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Magic can be made more interesting than it has usually
been. While there is certainly a large place in a magic system for reagent/level
spells cast by an individual character, other methods of spellcraft are often
ignored. If there is any other alternative in existing games, it's usually
clerical magic, which is assumed to be granted by a deity without involving
physical components like reagents. Other options are available, too, and they
can be added in addition rather than instead of traditional spell magic: group
magic crafted by characters pooling their powers, &quot;mental magic&quot; -
psionics - that are assumed to come from a person's inner will, ritual magic
like voodoo and witchcraft that involve fetish magic, incantation, and appeasing
dark powers, demonology (but only if demons are something truly to fear, and if
the chance of having slight control over one is worth the risk of the horrible
consequences), etc.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Exploration</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Many real-time and turn-based strategy do not allow the
player to see the entire playfield. The player can see the areas his or her
units are in well, and can see general details about areas where his or her
units have passed but are no longer near. This is usually called &quot;fog of
war&quot;. A similar system would serve a large-area game well. Although this
sort of information will be gathered together and put on fan web sites, having a
more accurate map in-game has definite advantages.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The more time you spend in an area, the more accurate
your in-game map of that area would become. A cartography or land lore skill
could add further benefits. Scrying magic should also serve to improve the map.
As a certain area became more and more familiar, the more details you would see:
topography, rivers, cities and outposts with their names, encampment areas,
dungeons, etc. Players should be able to &quot;compare maps&quot; in a specific
fashion, so that one player could trade a certain section of their map for a
certain section of someone else's. The accuracy of this copying could depend on
a cartography skill and the level of detail of the source map: it shouldn't be a
give-away. Not only would scrying serve to &quot;flesh out&quot; areas of the
map, scrying spells for spying on others should be more effective in areas where
the character's map is more complete. Characters should be able to annotate
their maps with location information and other text labels as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Offline time could be spent on exploration. Since there
wouldn't be any danger in exploring this way, progress should be much, much
slower and measured compared to the amount of detail gained by actual online
time spent in those same environments.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Language</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">One of the context-shattering elements of current online
role-playing games (the US servers, anyway) is that the majority of the
characters are speaking the same language. The only alternative to this is to
either speak in another language, or to make an English pseudo-dialect up, such
as the Shadowclan and the Picts have in UO. While this is an interesting
solution, it has serious limitations: an &quot;orc&quot; that only speaks &quot;orcish&quot;
is going to see the English of other characters and the player has to be
vigilant if his &quot;orc&quot; doesn't understand the common language.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Let's look an example of another option:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana">In order to keep this simple, let's discuss it in the
  context of a historical role-playing game rather than a fantasy role-playing
  game. Assume you're playing a game that sets the PCs as Roman soldiers and
  their enemies. Your band of Roman scouts are out in the northern periphery.
  They encounter an angry (but not yet combative) pack of barbarians. Actually,
  they're Gauls, but as a typical Roman, you don't make these sorts of
  distinctions. Your character doesn't speak Gaulish, and none of the Gauls
  speaks Latin. One of your fellow scouts, Tivus, speaks Gaulish at 50%, having
  come from a northern area of the Empire. The leader of the Gaulish pack has a
  very high intelligence score, so despite the fact that he doesn't speak Latin,
  his intelligence gives him a 10% communication bonus, so he'll know to phrase
  simply. This gives Tivus a 60% communication level with the Gaulish leader.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">The player of the Gaulish leader sees Tivus's
  greeting, and notes an indicator that tells him that Tivus's pronunciation
  accuracy is a little over half. He knows that if Tivus does not understand his
  words, they will get translated wrong, and that less translation failures will
  occur if he uses short words. His player types:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;This is our home. We want you to leave. We will
  not let you pass, but we will not pursue you if you leave.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Tivus sees an interface indication that this is
  Gaulish, and it reads &quot;This is aguli hom. We want vetat to leve. We will
  not can you passe, but va will not egak you if yu leave.&quot; This is because
  the text parser is going to screw up some words, and mildly alter others to
  represent that 40% lack of communication. Had he typed &quot;Leave our
  territory at once, you are not welcome here!&quot; it might have come out as
  &quot;Leav our ekavah at on, you ae not korveg heree&quot;, which is still
  intelligible, but less so because the longer words have a lesser chance at
  proper translation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Tivus uses the interface to indicate he wishes to
  speak Gaulish instead of Latin. He says to the Gaulish leader &quot;We are
  few. You are many.&quot; he then points to a bluff in the direction from which
  your party came. &quot;May we rest there for a while before we leave?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">The Gaulish leader sees Tivus's text, but with the
  same degree of inaccuracy that your friend saw the Gaulish leader's at. The
  other Gauls see it a little less accurately, at 50%, since they lack their
  leader's intelligence bonus. You, however, see both exchanges as a person with
  0% skill in Gaulish. Since the leader has a 10% bonus, your overall level of
  communication with him is 10%. The best you can hope for is a word or two to
  be correct, and you will understand none of what has transpired until Tivus
  tells you...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">...or, of course, until the Gauls decide that you're
  just an advance scout troop for the Seventh Roman Legion and decide that their
  interests are better served by charging you and bashing your skulls in rather
  than allowing you to press for time.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana">Written materials might need to be unreadable except at
a certain (high) level of communication between two parties, or translated once
only to avoid allowing multiple translations in order to eliminate the errors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Language training can be another offline character
development goal, and this degree of separation helps to eliminate the
&quot;casual internet chat&quot; environment of many online role-playing games
while providing a framework for upholding character race/nationality
differences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Internet apps like ICQ and IRC minimize the amount of
separation you can expect to accomplish. For 3D accelerated games, it's simply
not as convenient to switch back to the desktop to check messages, so the effect
in these games is not very noticeable. In any event, preventing users from
switching back to the desktop to prevent such programs (or others) is an
undesirable goal: it's your game, but it's your customer's computer.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Context, Part I</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Context is crucial. Through context, you convince your
players that you take your own game seriously. Out-of-context elements in your
game are red herrings. Players introduce out-of-context elements all the time.
One of the best ways to avoid this to any degree is to lead by example: if your
players see you adding out-of-context elements to the game, they'll not see any
reason to avoid doing so themselves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Common pitfalls include:</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Support characters with silly names: GM Fruitloop, GM
    Fatality</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Pointless references to real life.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana">In-game celebration of Earth holidays: Your world is
    your unique creation. Litter it with holidays that would make sense in-game.
    While some midwinter festival has been a common feature in many cultures in
    our world, there's no need to assume that a decorated pine tree or
    gift-giving be an integral part of it. Most nations have a distinctly
    national holiday, but not necessarily in the middle of summer nor involving
    pyrotechnics (or arcanotechnics). Most cultures have celebrated a springtime
    holiday of rebirth and renewal, but they aren't required to involve rabbits,
    painting eggs, pastels, and chocolate. We know what to celebrate in our
    real-life cultures; use holidays in-game to illustrate the uniqueness of
    your game's various cultures.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Anachronisms: Cannons in a world that hasn't invented
    other firearms of any sort, let alone sophisticated artillery. Combustion
    engines powering a flight vehicle in a world that has no history of
    combustion technology.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana">Much of that is merely keeping your game in line after
basic design decisions have been made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Perhaps more interesting than keeping context is how to
establish it in the first place.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Context, Part II</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The current crop of games are all set in a medieval-like
fantasy world where magic is commonplace. UO and EQ share many common D&amp;D
fantasy/mythological monster clichés: dragons, undead, trolls, orcs, etc. AC is
set in a similar world, though most of its monsters are unique rather than being
drawn from the same cast of characters as most other game. Even so, some are
very similar: drudges resemble orcs, gromnies resemble small wingless dragons,
banderlings resemble gnolls, and monougas resemble ogres. EQ is even more
steeped in D&amp;D tradition than UO, with a full complement of pulp-fantasy
elements such as dwarves, elves, halflings, and the lot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">It would be good for the genre for someone to think
differently. And this doesn't mean abandoning a D&amp;D cliché to adopt a
sci-fi cliché. It doesn't mean combining the two to make the next wave of
&quot;steampunk&quot; games, and it doesn't mean emulating cyberpunk RPGs.</font></p>
<p><em><font face="Verdana">You can make a fantasy role-playing game that avoids
clichés. Honest!</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Where does your world take place, and what sort of game
are you making?</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>High fantasy:</strong> Here's a bit of
    advice: &quot;It's been done.&quot; High fantasy is usually the
    &quot;traditional RPG&quot; with humans, demi-humans, dragons, undead, orcs,
    trolls, and magic that is about as rare as an automobile is in our world. If
    you're going to do high fantasy, there's going to be little to fundamentally
    separate your offering from UO, EQ, and even AC, SB, and UO2. Strictly
    speaking, high fantasy simply indicates the author/developer's attitude
    toward magic. If you're going to use high fantasy, you'd best be original
    about it.&nbsp; A campaign that took place a properly horrific <a href="http://www.morpheusint.com/core/artists/Barlowe/Inferno.htm">Hell</a>,
    given a grand scale and opportunity for advancement beyond the lot of a
    cursed soul, could provide plenty of opportunities for a truly unique MRPG
    experience.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>Low fantasy:</strong> This sort of world has
    been explored more in <a href="http://risse.tierranet.com/asprin/books/thieves_world.html">fantasy
    fiction</a> than in RPGs of any sort. The definition of the genre revolves
    around the treatment of the supernatural. Low fantasy generally has few
    &quot;fantastic&quot; elements about it: magic is not an everyday part of
    life, there are less &quot;supernatural&quot; elements (creatures with
    magical powers as well as spell phenomenon), and that which does exist is
    often toned down to the point where it is never really demonstrated in a way
    where it must be presumed to exist: much like the common attitude toward
    Medieval Europe, most educated people consider magic to be superstition,
    though many may believe in it fervently. Low fantasy tends to involve
    stories about people and their interaction rather than epic quests against
    evil, though much Arthurian literature is a good example of &quot;epic low
    fantasy&quot;, often involving no magic at all, or at most, magic whose
    existence is not presented to the reader as an established fact. If high
    fantasy is the world of the demon-fighting elf paladin with a mystical sword
    and a bevy of spellcasting followers, low fantasy is the world of the
    weathered mercenary who needs to decide if his stomach is more important
    than his morality.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>Historical fiction:</strong> Think of
    historical fiction as low fantasy set on Earth. Historical fiction has not
    been dealt with in the major MRPGs. Historical fiction would involve more
    research than creation: if the whole world is simulated, at what time? What
    sort of conflicts existed, and who were the major players then? If you set
    the game in 100AD, is your game centered around <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/romans/empire.htm">Rome</a>,
    or do you simulate the Americas and the Orient and the dominant cultures
    there, too? Your historical research will come into play: plate mail,
    muskets, feudalism, central Christian churches, and crossbows did not exist
    in 100AD. What's more, common stereotypes and historical revisionism need to
    be avoided. The Gallic Celt of 100AD Gaul is markedly different than the
    Pictish Celt of the Scottish eastlands, and portraying them as
    happy-go-lucky nature-loving primitives would be shoddy research at best.
    Without your fantasy monsters as a cash spigot, you're going to have to use
    other motivations: war between established foes, internal warfare of
    political treachery, exploration of newly discovered lands with hostile
    inhabitants, and so forth. Given the Roman attitude of
    &quot;barbarians&quot;, ranging anywhere from those considered unhuman and
    approachable only in terms of warfare to those &quot;barbarians&quot; who
    were assimilated into the Empire itself, even if after a history of
    conflict, there is clearly plenty of room for differentiation.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><strong>Historical fantasy:</strong> Or perhaps
    &quot;historical fiction&quot; with a fantasy twist. What if your game took
    place in Europe in the Dark Ages right after the discovery of codified and
    reproducible magic, alchemy, witchcraft, and/or demonology? How about a
    feudal Japan under similar circumstances? If a game based on historical
    fiction seems to be too hard a sell (I personally think, done right, it
    could explode), this might be an alternative.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana">Thought needs to be given to creatures. How similar is
your world to Earth? Are familiar Earth animals present? If not, what lives in
the niches occupied by various mundane creatures?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Developers get caught up in simulating a &quot;virtual
ecology&quot; in a world where the constants are much different. How many
pigeons would you see in our urban areas if birds were killed for feathers to
make arrows? In a world where some degree of warfare or hunting is undertaken by
the majority of the population, the answer is &quot;very few&quot;. Herbivores
are going to have to be much smaller and resourceful in areas that have fewer
plants. Animals can be much bigger in areas that have superabundant prey. Whales
eat krill swarms, brontosauruses grazed in water filled with vegetation,
&quot;big cats&quot; can only survive in areas with large amounts of prey. This
isn't to say that you should have an ecologically accurate thousand rabbits for
every wolf: your players are going to be less interested in rabbits than wolves,
no doubt, and more interested in &quot;marsh lurkers&quot; than wolves. Rather
than fret about accuracy, use &quot;hinting&quot;: in areas with no (prey),
there shouldn't be any (predator). Don't use your server's valuable resources
keeping track of how many rabbits wolf A has eaten. In areas with abundant
(prey), there should be more (predator), unless (predator's predator) are in
great numbers nearby.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The artist Wayne Barlowe has written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0894806297/o/qid=955656808/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/104-6083010-8882053">books</a>
about alien worlds. Thought is given to subjects like biospheres that make
sense, issues of prey and predation, and to the individual creature's place in
its environment. There are many lessons in this &quot;whole environment&quot;
approach to world design.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">If nothing else in a world is near human, how did humans
get there? Magical transport from Earth or other unnamed lands seems generic and
unsatisfying, and encourages players to bring the same characters they've played
in other games into your game. In UO, humans came from Sosaria as well as Earth.
When players bring in their existing character personas, they dilute your world.
The solution isn't to lay down the law on your players, the solution is to
provide them with alternatives that make them want to play in your world, rather
than just show up.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Context, Part III</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Everything your players can do in your world must be
make sense to the fiction. Repeat this phrase often. This is one of the ways you
give your world context. The existing games have serious flaws in this category:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana">In Ultima Online, one of the biggest offenders in this
  regard is resurrection. Especially disorienting is the way the game fiction
  treats death. When a fiction-centered NPC dies, that's it - he or she is dead.
  There might be a funeral, a search for the body, or mourning. When a PC dies,
  his or her ghosts jogs over to the nearest wandering healer or shrine and
  shrugs it off. While the idea that &quot;death should mean something&quot; has
  validity, the simple fact is that if death is anything other than permanent,
  the difference needs to be backed up by the fiction.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">When Seer or GM-controlled plot characters died, that
  was it, they were dead. Sometimes, when dealing with players with less
  experience with plot events, people would effectively scratch their heads
  wondering why the character didn't resurrect. Other ghosts would follow that
  ghost and try to help them to the nearest healing point. When the post-event
  fiction was written up, death was death, and never explained otherwise. In
  events and plots that I had a hand in, I always strove to provide some reason
  to explain this. Sometimes, it was sufficient to explain it with the concept
  that dark &quot;soul-banishing magic&quot; was used which prevents the soul
  from re-entering the body. Often, this was enough, and the players were more
  likely to respect the outcome without going back to their guilds bemoaning the
  silly way in which events treat death.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">In Asheron's Call, any player has the ability to send
  instant communication to any other online player in the game. By using the
  /tell command and other features, you can instantly message people by name,
  your patron, your monarch, or your fellowship. With the friends list, you can
  tell the moment that character is logged on. Rather than cave entrances to
  underground dungeon environments, often the entry is a shimmering portal on a
  plain. While the portals are explained in the fiction (and are, in fact,
  central to it), the instant communication is not. The only way one can
  logically explain it in the context of the game is to attribute it to some
  sort of psionic power or other telepathic ability, but no such explanation is
  offered. To have that communication without an explanation of how it takes
  place gives private conversation in AC a very Quake-like feel.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana">Explaining the conveniences of your game system in your
fiction is your job, not your players'.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">The Law: Players</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Ideally, your game world would be treated as such, and
your players would have a common sense approach to decency, fair play, and what
does and doesn't constitute appropriate behavior...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">...and if you design with that assumption in mind,
you'll be in for a rude awakening.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">You need to make very clear what is and isn't acceptable
behavior, and enforce it diligently. This doesn't mean you have to have a
draconian set of policies; this simply means that whatever your policies are,
you need to communicate them very clearly to your players and the staff which
enforces them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Contrary to the UO model, this needs to be kept in mind
during the design phase rather than ignored by programmers as a support
responsibility that takes effect after the development work is done. Adding
accountability on top of a structure not designed with such concerns is a
difficult process, needlessly so. Give your support team the tools they need to
properly administer the game as soon as it's out, don't put it on the back
burner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">AC has taken a line on exploitation that neither UO nor
EQ has tried: programmer accountability. When Turbine releases buggy code (as
every programming team does from time to time, this is the nature of the beast),
this is treated as a problem with Turbine, not a problem with players, and steps
are taken to resolve the issue without punishing players for problems they
didn't cause. OSI has usually seen fit to ignore its mistakes until something
brings it to a head or until the player community can scream no louder, and
Verant is more apt to hold its players responsible for avoiding any activity
which even resembles AI exploitation, let alone willful exploitation by players.
This often puts OSI and Verant (even more so) at war with its players, which
poisons the relationship of the development staff and the customer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">While a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; program might make
sense in situations where, due to game design, a certain exploit is
unpreventable (there will always be a dupe bug in UO unless OSI makes
fundamental changes to the way it tracks characters across server boundaries,
which simply isn't practical), Turbine's model seems more desirable for
situations where a code-based solution can be coded into the next patch.
Turbine's publisher, Microsoft, allots Turbine a generous and predictable patch
size allotment per month, which has given them flexibility in this regard. If
your patch allotment (or your development staff size) is small and you're not
ready to make that sort of commitment to closing exploitation loopholes, it is
that much more critical that your support and development staff have a very
clear picture of what is and isn't exploitation, harassment, and violation of
your usage agreement. UO in particular has had a poor track record in this
department, and has had problems since the beginning with GMs disagreeing on
what is and isn't a violation of their TOS.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">The Law: Characters</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Danger needs to exist, and many of your players are
willing to dole it out. The problem is that if you make it too easy, you get
remorseless killing without consequences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In a large world, there is room for different societies
with different laws. Perhaps much of the &quot;civilized&quot; world has similar
laws against murder, thievery, and crimes against the state (leading
insurrections, for example). A character that lives in one kingdom and who kills
a soldier of the king's guard will almost certainly be wanted dead by the
authorities in that country. In an enemy nation, however, they might consider
such an act a heroic deed and welcome him - as long as he confines his killing
to the subjects of his former king rather than the citizens of his new home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Some areas may be completely uncivilized and not have
any sort of law enforcement. Others may be so different from the norm that they
become a haven for criminals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">However this works out, there needs to be a means to
keep criminals out of areas in which they are no longer welcome, and the
consequences for risking being caught in those areas must be severe. A militia
of NPCs and PCs may have an order from the King that allows them to hunt down
known criminals. If this is at all practical, it's much better than invincible
guards popping out of nowhere. There's a completely different feel to a player
when a character gets whacked by an instant-kill guard the moment he crosses an
unseen city boundary and that of being hunted down by an angry mob that grows
the longer it's evaded. Maybe the odds are still miserable, but if there's a
slim chance that, properly executed, freedom can be had by escaping the kingdom
or city, that's more entertaining. In feudal and pre-feudal societies, the law
wasn't apt to &quot;forget&quot; the wrongdoings of criminals, either, so in
cases of serious crimes like murder, the guilty character shouldn't be able to
stroll back into the capital after a few weeks of beating down &quot;evil&quot;
creatures or persons. Only in rare cases should this be possible. For lesser
crimes, the law isn't as apt to remember the offender as long.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Regardless of how death is treated in your game, the
penalty for an &quot;outlaw&quot; character getting caught by (or brought to)
the law should be significantly greater than the penalty for normal death at the
hands of a personal enemy or a monster.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">If players are able to form communities with their own
laws, members of the law enforcement arm of that community should be able to
flag a character as a known criminal. This opens up possibilities of misuse, but
given that player communities are generally small and easily avoidable (cities
don't move), each will in time earn a reputation among other players, and
lawless cities aren't going to attract as many merchants, though they may
attract more mercenaries and those looking to hire them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In any case, there should be places where the most vile
criminals are not hounded by the law. Areas like this are dangerous, and anyone
entering them should be prepared for danger.</font></p>
<p><big><font face="Verdana">Conclusion</font></big></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The MRPG development community is going to find out very
shortly if there is enough room in this market for five or more concurrent
offerings. I believe that the first title that represents a significant
evolution over the current works available (and several in-progress) may have a
chance to grab a majority market share from a currently-fractured player-base
spread across several games.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">UO was ambitious even for its flaws. EQ attracted an
audience that preferred a 3D environment or who had not found UO to their
liking. AC attracted an audience looking for the next &quot;good thing&quot;.
The titles in development are going after a finite number of users who will play
more than one game concurrently, or are willing to switch from one to the other.
I think they'll find that there aren't any more &quot;free rides&quot; in this
genre...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">...it's time to innovate again.</font></p>
