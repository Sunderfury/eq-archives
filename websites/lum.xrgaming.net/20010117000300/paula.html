          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">For those of you who still get all your

          news of the outside world from Dr. Twister, UOVault, and that patch

          message that comes up when you start UO, some things have been

          happening lately.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/politics/111598clinton-jones-rdp.html"><img border="0" src="paula!.gif" alt="She knows. She KNOWS, man! Go buy her record." align="right" hspace="10" WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="147"></a>First

          up, Paula Jones has her own psychic hotline now. This is in addition

          to her new career as a country and western singer. (You know, I'm

          making NONE of this up. ZERO.) Women all over Nashville are now

          petitioning Bill Clinton, in the hopes that if he shows them his penis

          they too can break into the music business, or at the very least a

          psychic hotline they can call their own. </font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">In proper commemoration of this triumph

          of the independent American woman, I now declare that Paula Jones is

          the official obsessive-compulsive icon of lum.webtoys.net, replacing

          LadyMOI and Sorsha The Amazing UO Cyberwhore. Expect more and more

          Paula Jones updates until I come to my senses.</font></p>



          

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">In other news, we're still bombing

          Serbia, and will continue to bomb Serbia until they surrender, we run

          out of bombs, or Designer Dragon implements a Balkans PK switch. Oh,

          and I heard at work there's some movie coming out today or something.</font></p>

          <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial">

I find myself agreeing with most of your assertions in part 1 of your series 

of essays on community. I personally fit right in between Merchant and 

Roleplayer, with a small dash of Hunter mixed in. The vast majority of people 

I know in UO could also be fit into your categorizations. However, I find 

myself disagreeing with a few points in your second essay, mostly those 

involving the volunteer program.<br><br>My main objection is to your dismissal 

of the counselor system as merely deputized, untrained help. I was in the 

first wave of new counselors to be robed in December/January, and I believe 

that such an abrupt dismissal of them, even if unintended, is a grave 

injustice. Yes, the old system allowed in many that were not very qualified. 

Everyone has a horror story of their meeting with Counselor k3wld00d, who 

answered with &quot;Sup?&quot; and departed with 

&quot;laterz&quot;.<br><br>That old system, however, is dead. The new system has 

a stringent set of requirements that DEMAND applicants be knowledgeable of 

every portion of UO. More importantly, it demands that they know how to find 

information through use of Stratics, the Crossroads of Brittania, UOVault, 

and the owo.com website. It also demands maturity. The Senior Counselors 

for each shard interview every single potential counselor who 

demonstrates the ability and knowledge, and I have seen NO applicant get 

through that process and later abuse his power, especially given the 

extensive training OSI requires its counselors to go through before they can 

work<br>on a shard.<br><br>With regards to the rest of the essay, perhaps the 

only solution OSI needs to look at is requiring the same stringent standards 

of its GMs as of its counselors. I won't argue that they exude an air of 

&quot;this is only a job, don't bug me&quot;. Perhaps if OSI would just apply 

the counselor requirements to the GM positions, then the problem would solve 

itself, but in the meantime, I'd like to ask for a little separation of the 

two<br>in your writings...</font></i></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Well, you can certainly ask.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">However, the unpaid volunteer program

          has been a </font><font face="Verdana, Arial"><b>massive disaster</b>

          for Ultima Online, and any &quot;new system&quot; has got many miles

          of road to walk before the damage to the public trust can be repaired.

          The screening process for counselors was a <b>joke</b>. The <b>vast,

          vast majority</b> of counselors in UO were there only because they

          thought it was a promotion from Player. <b>Calls in the queue went

          unanswered for hours </b>as hundreds of Cs sat in #uo-council

          comparing dick sizes. <b>PK guilds had pet smurfs scout for them and

          then gloat over the kills. </b>This is not something you can just wash

          away with a breezy &quot;it's better now, really!&quot; <b>We want

          proof. </b></font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">You want my opinion? <b>The counselor

          program needs to be eliminated. It doesn't work. The baggage from the

          KewlDeWd Smurfs is too heavy to wash away.</b></font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">In its place, <b>a comprehensive system

          of technical support must be created for Ultima Online. </b>A thorough

          analysis needs to be made of the number of customer service calls per

          shard per night, skew that analysis towards the high end, and plan a

          system of blanket, complete coverage so that any call is answered <b>within

          three minutes or less. </b>That's the standards we meet in the real

          world, it's not too much to ask,<b> as paying customers,</b> that it

          be met here.<b> </b>There may be a place for unpaid volunteers within

          this system. There may not be. However, whomever staffs this system <b>must

          be held legally liable </b>for their actions as they reflect upon

          Origin Systems. They are customer service representatives, exactly the

          same as any GM, and must be held to the same standards of auditing,

          training and recruiting.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial"><b>What? GMs aren't held to any

          standards of training and recruiting?</b></font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Oh, and a response to one specific

          point:</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Oh really? Well, I have seen it,

          trying to track down the perpetrator.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Obviously The New Order faltered a bit

          those smurfs from The Bad Old Days who somehow are still around?</b></font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Burn it down, and start over.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Next email comes from every

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial"><i>

I can sympathize with both sides pretty readily.&nbsp; Much like real cops who get 

an attitude problem, that of a GM's is often crafted by the fact that GMs 

have to deal with the worst of the worst on a fairly regular basis.&nbsp; More 

than that, it's not just the worst sorts who make GMing less enjoyable.&nbsp; 

Banning someone who's been a contant participant in vulgar harassment is one 

thing, but even when they have to deal with the role-playing community, which 

you would think would be an easier crowd, you have just as many of them who 

try to &quot;get something&quot; out of the GMs.&nbsp; In any player-GM 

confrontation, a GM is almost always required to say nothing about it 

publicly, whereas the victim is free to proclaim his unjust treatment, 

sometimes completely devoid of facts. </i></font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial"><i>Lest I come off as an apologist, 

I've had my first-hand experience with careless GMing. The most memorable 

was on April 22nd 1998.&nbsp; UOVault carried it in part, and the CoB carried it 

in full.&nbsp; I saved it at <a href="http://delusion.smart.net/frustration.html">http://delusion.smart.net/frustration.html</a>.&nbsp; 

The outcry was strong enough that GM Ed posted to the CoB news submission.&nbsp; 

It was posted right above my submission.&nbsp; It was important enough to e-mail 

me about it and promise me something would be done.&nbsp; It wasn't, 

however, important enough to actually follow through and keep the promises 

he made in the post.<br><br>As to your premise that there wasn't any conflict 

between role-players and anti-role-players until the reputation system, I 

have a different take.&nbsp; In my experience, they've been at each others' 

throats from day one.&nbsp; Ultima Online has always been a challenging 

environment to role-play in due to the differing goals of these two groups.&nbsp; 

Had OSI taken some of its tough stances early on rather than waiting until 

now, things may have been a lot different.&nbsp; The anti-role-playing 

community is now bored and spiteful - they play to ruin events, cause other 

people needless misery, and when they decide they've had enough and quit 

UO, its only after they're satisfied that they've caused other people 

to quit.&nbsp; The role-playing community is now jaded and intolerant - they don't expect things to change greatly, they paint all

          non-role-players with the same broad d3wd brush, and the interesting 

distinctly Britannian developments of early 1998 have given way to ghost 

town cities, Fight Night 204,653, and a sense that the dev team is 

never going to give them the tools that they pushed for shortly after 

release, such as some implementation of a virtue system, or the return 

of multi-shard plots.<br><br>Had some early attempt been made to clamp down 

on antisocial idiocy (it wasn't limited to who was killing who), and to 

encourage role-players to do more outreach and inclusiveness, perhaps these 

two groups - if not playing nicely in the same sandbox - wouldn't be stuck 

across a battle line with GMs in the middle, irritated with them 

both. </i></font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial"><i>The fear of, to put it in the context of today's rant, &quot;White 

Flight&quot; from UO to EQ isn't much of an issue now.&nbsp; The idea that EQ was 

either going to draw off all the PKers - or in contrast, become a 

role-playing haven - hasn't panned out.&nbsp; Of course it didn't, EQ wasn't aimed 

at a niche audience, just as UO wasn't.<br><br>Rather than focusing on what 

is, what's important is to focus on what will be.&nbsp; Each side of the 

RP/anti-RP line need to respect the others' right to play.&nbsp; People who play 

just to make people miserable (be they a harassing PK, or an RPer too elitist 

to interact with anyone not in their clique) need to move on.&nbsp; If that means 

changing how they play, fine.&nbsp; If it means quitting, that's fine, too.&nbsp; A 

renewed respect for the context and role-playing atmostphere of the game 

would certainly help.&nbsp; Players not using GMs as a tool against other players 

would help even more.&nbsp; When confrontational topics come up on messageboards, 

the surest sign that someone isn't willing to consider the other 

person's point of view is the use of the word &quot;whine&quot;.&nbsp; 

&quot;Whiner PKs who want to kill without consequences.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Whiner 

role-players who get pissed when you kill them.&quot;&nbsp; Yeah, whatever.&nbsp; In 

USENET, when newsgroups were still relatively free of spam and .edu domains 

were more common than .com domains, there was a rule of thumb.&nbsp; If anyone 

called an opposing point of view or the person who held it 

&quot;fascist&quot;, a &quot;nazi&quot; or made any insulting reference to 

&quot;Hitler&quot;, it was jokingly said &quot;nazis mentioned, discussion 

over&quot;, to indicate that when people were using the nazi analogy, they 

had ceased to make any point worth reading.&nbsp; The UO community equivalent 

would be &quot;whine&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Everyone's a whiner, 

discussion over.&quot;<br><br>The UO atmosphere can be improved if the 

players think it's a worthwhile goal.&nbsp; Also, the creators of the next 

role-playing multiplayer project, no matter what form it takes, need to learn 

valuable lessons from Ultima Online to make sure we're writing the same rants 

about a different game five years from now.<br><br>Delusion<br>Fascist whiner</i></font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Couple of points - I never thought that

          roleplayers and PKers weren't at each other's throats from the start.

          Merely that until the rep system, it wasn't a contest. In every

          meeting between roleplayers and PKers, the roleplayers were

          immediately wiped out. It wasn't until consequences for murders were

          introduced that the PKers had any inducement whatsoever not to

          annihilate everyone on screen. At that point, the community matured

          enough for actual conflict (as opposed to annihilation) to develop.

          Roleplayers actually have an actual agenda now beyond &quot;Don't kill

          me&quot;.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial">Also, of course GMs see the worst of

          players, no matter the archetype. Hey... it's <b>part of the job.

          Welcome to the wonderful world of customer support. If they can't

          handle the job, they need a new one. </b>It's another excuse, not a

          reason.</font></p>
