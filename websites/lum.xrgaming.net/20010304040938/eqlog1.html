<p>&lt;Aradune&gt; sonyesq is an scea attorney<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 104<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; if anyone is around who wants to talk about the eula issue, we
can<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; I am director of legal and business affairs for SCEA, the
publisher of Everquest.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; what he said :<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; ;)<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; well, it looks like you have caught everyone playing the game
at the moment =)<br>
* TheRaver blinks<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; I am here to listen to your concerns, and answer any questions
that you might have.<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; except for me<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; thats the problem -- everyone is playing :)<br>
&lt;Mystryxx&gt; im not playing right now =)<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; maybe you should bring the servers down =)<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; ROFL<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; oh, that would go over well<br>
&lt;zer031&gt; you should've been here 30min ago, there was a heated dsicussion
about the eula then<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Gonna be a problem tomorrow night, too, Brad, cause you are
bringing down the servers in the AM, which means I have a dragon to kill in the
PM<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; heh, good point<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; unless i perma kill it on your server :)<br>
* Aradune cackles.<br>
&lt;zer031&gt; heheh<br>
&lt;Mystryxx&gt; haha<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Naw, you have evil GM's who do that for you.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; true, true<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; dragons deserve to live, players dont =)<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; hmm<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 105<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; smr for 2yaks<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Brad, any way that we can let people know we are here?<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; sounds like a good deal to me<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; silly me I dont even know about the changes to the eula<br>
&lt;Mystryxx&gt; what is the eula???<br>
* Druppy waves at everyone<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; end user license agreement<br>
&lt;Mystryxx&gt; ohh<br>
*** melusina sets mode: +v Aradune<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; ya know<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; that thing you agree to every time you play =)<br>
&lt;Mystryxx&gt; whats wrong with it?<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; is that really lum?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Howdy Aradune, SonyEsq<br>
* Aradune peers at lum.<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; apparently there was a change<br>
&lt;zer031&gt; melusina: I red about in on the EQVault news<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; Aradune, any ideas on the player smithable steel plate? like if
its being<br>
LumTheMad&gt; Yep, it's me, I'm working on a followup story now<br>
* melusina kicks Druppy<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; ah. hey man, LOVED the 1989 story<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; When Japanese Fear breaks go aray!<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; http://foh.noows.com/?mid=12422<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Heh. Yes, but did Abashi?<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; tonight on fox 8/7 central<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; How do you do, Lum? I play, and stop by your site every once in
a while...enjoy some of your stories.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; he was laughing too<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Regarding the new EULA<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; we can all laugh at ourselves -- we don't take all this that
seriously<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; Hidaglio: that's CT<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; woot<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; mel:?<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; DaS: ahh :)<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; melusina: ?<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; just nailed ct<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; df, bf, 2 crooks =D<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; er staves<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; Durppy?<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; er<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; wow that really is aradune :)<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; Druppy<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; what protections do users have against Verant unilaterally
declaring<br>
what is &quot;appropriate&quot; for monitoring?<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; yes it really is Hid<br>
Session Start: Wed Apr 05 02:55:11 2000<br>
* Logging #everquest to '#everquest.log'<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; I have my client set to recognize him now =p<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Well, let me try that.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; The limitations are twofold.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; First, the information that is examined is strictly limited to
that which is game related.<br>
*** melusina sets mode: +v SonyEsq<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; melusina&#02;:&#02; huh?<br>
&lt;zer031&gt; if i understand it correctly the eula will change so that Verant
will be able to do something about the 3rd party softwares amongst other
things... or rather as a legal protection so they can counter these 3rd party
programs<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; For instance, no one would insist that Verant not examine the EQ
directories during its patch routine<br>
* wyrd blinks<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Permit me to finish, please...then I'll get to the next question<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Because, if Verant did not peek, then it would have to patch the
entire game every time it patches.<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; Aradune: 1 Q before I go to work, would it be too hard to make
fear repop all at once after a specified time such as 16 hours or something?
This fear farming thing is one of the main reasons I disliked EQ at high levels,
a few guilds work thier ass of and die for the equip while a few others just
reap the rewards with no risk<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; So, it looks to see what needs updating, and updates.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; not going to answer anything while SonyEsq speaks, sorry<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Now, secondly, there is a reasonableness standard.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; The standard of reasonableness is not a subjective one, it is an
objective one.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; That means, (this is gonna sound like a pile of legalese, but I
didn't write 200 years of common law)<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; who is sony esq?<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; director of legal and business affairs, scea<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; oh..<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; and a real nice guy too :)<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; That means that it is what a &quot;reasonable person, acting
with knowledge of professionals in the industry, would adjudge as fair.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; (close quote).<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; So it is Verant's intention, in taking any of these steps, to
only do what is necessary and reasonable to protect the integrity of its game.
Certainly, no more.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Scrolling up, to make sure that I really answered, instead of
saying what I wanted to say<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; which we feel, btw, is in the interest of the players (that the
game have less cheating)<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Ok...I think I fairly answered that one.<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; and, if you have a problem with that, please go play UO =)<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Follow up question, if you don't mind then I'll be quiet<br>
* Mystryxx nods in agreement<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Sure, Lum...go for it.<br>
* Aradune nods at lum<br>
&lt;TheRaver&gt; wow<br>
&lt;TheRaver&gt; this fake Q&amp;A session is pretty good<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; hehe<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Given that the monitoring is put into place, what is to
prevent an employee of Verant to use that for his/her own purposes, outside of
what is specified by your agreement? Basically, what protections if any are in
place for misuse.<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 106<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Asking for some clarification...k?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; k<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I'm thinking specifically of a repeat of the &quot;GM
Darwin&quot; scenario - someone rogue at Verant, acting without authorization<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Are you asking what practical steps are in place at Verant? Or
are you asking whether Verant is not prohibiting, in the EULA, its employees
from using private information?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; The former... I assume the latter already exists<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Ok...let's think about that for a minute.<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; in other words... my task list is sent ot eq.. is it saved in a
database? and who has access to thayt database.. and what are you doing to
ensure the database cannot be abused by any employees or even accessed<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; wee.. fun with irc on a pda..<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Well, all employees of Verant are under several legal duties.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; that's like saying that why can't anyone go into the server code
and have it format your drives?<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; only certain programmers have access to server code<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 107<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; and its the server code that queries the task list<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; only a prorammer could query additional information<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; and only the programmers with access to the server code<br>
*** mithaniel sets mode: +o Caladen<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; and the information gathered is written to secure logs<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; aradune, yea, but I some how doubt thats where out stuff is
saved... infact id guess player task list data collected goes out of the hands
of your admins and into who ever you deamed in charge of tracking down cheaters<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; just as your credit card info is, etc.<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 106<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; same principles<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; anyone that could take my Q before I go to work :)<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; we already have very sensitive information about you<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; and we protect it<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; the same would be true of task list information<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; shush Hid<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; bah<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; haha<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; ask it.. I see no rush of questions.. its early<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; Aradune: 1 Q before I go to work, would it be too hard to make
fear repop all at once after a specified time such as 16 hours or something?
This fear farming thing is one of the main reasons I disliked EQ at high levels,
a few guilds work thier ass of and die for the equip while a few others just
reap the rewards with no risk<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; not going to answer hid, sorry. am here to discuss eula info<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; ir repops in 6 hours though<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; No fear for you!<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; ohh ok ara<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; Hid you are playing Quake these days anyway =p<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Can you folks see how such a general EULA clause is raising
this level of concern?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I mean, it basically says &quot;we can decide what we are
looking for, then go look for it&quot;<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; yeah got bored of EQ at high levels its a big soap opera with 1
big megaguild if you aren't in the big guild EQ is 10% as fun as it could be<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; agreed to a point, lum, which is why we're still contemplating
the language<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Lum, with respect, we disagree as to its generality<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Now, I understand what SonyEQ meant by reasonable standard of
expectation<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; &quot;data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable
discretion, determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest&quot;<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; the key phrase here in my mind is &quot;we determine&quot;<br>

&lt;Aradune&gt; oops<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; split?<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; AYE<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; aye<br>
&lt;Calista&gt; got booted<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; lost sonyesq<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; its all your fault Aradune<br>
&lt;Mystryxx&gt; eek<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; yea bit some may argue in eq.. you going to a virtual dance club
useing realplayer on your computer.. but verrant requires the ysearch your
comouter looking for DoS pingerss nad packetsniffers<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; explaining why he hadnt said anything for a while :)<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; you made the server split =)<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; i did?<br>
*** Calista is now known as LumTheMad<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I got booted too<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; &lt;--- kidding<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; oh, heh :)<br>
&lt;zer031&gt; i think the discussion here really is an old one, there have
allways been people arguing for personal privacy... so it's hard to discuss a
single case when the privacy discussion is so much broader<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; gah<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; wow I killed that didnt I...<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; =p<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; uo is weak as hell<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 106<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; off topic i know<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; hopefully sonyesq returns<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; you may have to sell the fact that people using such programs
actualy harm other users<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; twiggy: 150,000 people disagree :)<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; he should prolly switch to another server<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; but i need to rant :(<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; oh come on Aradune, you're a lawyer, right?<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; nothing like a foot and a half wide keybored to murder a sentance<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; &#02;&#02;Aradune&#31;:&#31; i restarted my account like a week
ago cause i wanted to pvp a bit<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; and as it turns out<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; dascott: agreed. if most people don't think its worth it, then
there's an issue<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; lum: hell no :)<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; everybody and his mother is a npk now<br>
*** melusina sets mode: +v SCEA<br>
&lt;SCEA&gt; Man, that stunk<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; glad you're back :)<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; there he is<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; I like to think of myself as a lawyer but my reasoning is logic
based so I allways become a shitty lawyer ;)<br>
* zer031 agrees with DaScott<br>
&lt;SCEA&gt; Got bounced, and then it told me that my nickname was in use<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; one last thing, Im not sure but I do believe blizzard lost a
law suit over scanning peoples regisitries with some of thier products if it
holds true don't see why verant can do it and not blizzard<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; several people got bounced, but most are back<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; IRC is evil<br>
&lt;SCEA&gt; Then tried about 2348729348 servers.<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 107<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; Hidaglio is evil, he should be at work already =p<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; did everyone here my club analogy?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; anyway I was saying the issue is really the general nature of
the EULA... I got where you said we differ on that then got booted<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; gotta be there in 13 mins :)<br>
&lt;SCEA&gt; Anyway, what'd I miss while I was in the ether?<br>
*** irc-w.frontiernet.net sets mode: +v gentry<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; Aradune made a good analogy<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; I read the club analogy but thats peoples free will not
everyone is willing to let you look at thier registry<br>
&lt;HiroHiro&gt; core.com lets just bout anyone on<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; hid, nah, its the same<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; hid... I dont think they lost or won a lawsuit... but that was
over stepping there authority.. afaik eq is only looking at your task list. you
cant get any personal info from a task list<br>
*** SCEA is now known as SonyEsq<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; you dont have to go to the club, you dont have to play EQ<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; same thing<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 106<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Using that logic you can do almost any privacy violation tho<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; you can make the choice to play or not...if you dont want them
doing this, dont play, thats pretty simple<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; on a voluntary basis, yes<br>
*** irc.core.com sets mode: +oooo rallos frash rodcet Kind_Bud<br>
*** irc.core.com sets mode: +ooo CPU b00 zen_<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; probablem about anaologies is you wind up arguing the ifs and
butts of the analogy and not the reality, heh<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; people give up 'right's all the time<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; holy hell i butchered that<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Well, that's why we take great care in tailoring the language to
what is necessary.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; to do certain things<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; but i have to play :(<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 105<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; if you dont want a bloody nose, dont sniff crack<br>
* Hidaglio consoles DaScott<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; i go race my car on a race trace, i sign away certain rights to
sue the track<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Using the nightclub analogy tho<br>
* Twiggy-2 twitches<br>
&lt;Mystryxx_&gt; oww :(<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; heck, if you wanna get pissy, countless programs when installed
will pilffer your registry and send your name and email to the comanys site,
usualy when you register. thats wh yI never have my full name or a alid email in
my registry (IE is the main program where everyones name and email is stored)<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; wouldn't it be closer to &quot;OK, you've gone to this
nightclub for a year, you kind of like the place&quot;<br>
&lt;Sunniegal&gt; OMG.... i can't believe there actually is such a channel<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; and they change their policy, and start padding you down?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; &quot;and now you have to allow us to search your trunk and
car for drugs before we let you in&quot;<br>
&lt;Vap1d&gt; erm anybody know if I can run eq on win2k with a tnt2 card?<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; yes, exactly<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; agreed lum<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Lum, let's remember something<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; im sure it happens<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 106<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; When you first entered that nightclub, there was a sign on the
door.<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; EQ and Win2k currently don't like each other very much<br>
* wyrd just wants info on new servers. *sniff*<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; there is an incident at the club, and so they made a new policy,
and they start searching backpacks<br>
&lt;Hidaglio&gt; Im really gone to work now Im gonna be late<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; even tho they didn't before<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; It said &quot;We reserve the right to change our rules at any
time&quot;..<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; Sunniegal: an eq channel? 55k people playing a time and there's
a channel about it on irc? who would have thought<br>
&lt;Sunniegal&gt; :)...<br>
&lt;Sunniegal&gt; i dunno... i haven't played everquest in like .... forever<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Now, let's remember that we're all reasonable people. And we
don't go putting in unreasonable rules.<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; there othe ri mmitation channels on loser networks but this is the
best... efnet forever.. yo<br>
&lt;Mystryxx_&gt; its like DUH people!!! remember!?! You're in OUR world now :D
:D<br>
&lt;Sunniegal&gt; ahhaha<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; But just like the EULA said from day 1 that we could change it,
so the nightclub would have a sign saying the same thing...<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; well I think ultimately its not going to be a problem for
anyone unless they are breaking the rules<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; DoubleClick said they were reasonable folks too, remember.<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; aaggh<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; im actually not familiar with doubleclick<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; are you sonyesq?<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; It's legal to change the rules, it's just not generally popular<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; DoubleClick is the largest ad banner network<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Well...can we agree that taking steps to prevent cheating,
hacking and taking down the servers is reasonable?<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; rules have to change and evolve...otherwise whatst he point?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; they decided to start matching names to ad banner cookies<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; last I checked you guys weren't afraid to make unpopular
decisions<br>
* Aradune grins at DaScott<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; &quot;so your ad banner experience could be better tailored to
your buying preferences&quot;<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; as long as verant doesnt turn into osi or fuck with my mp3s
they can do whatever they want with my harddrive<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Ahh...but Lum, that's a &quot;commercial exploitation&quot;
purpose. Can we agree that this is different?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Sure<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; this is to create a better playing environment for our
playerbase<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; hehe.. I read todays news post on eqvault and had a momment of
happiness when i heard a new eq frontend would be downloaded.. thinking
&quot;yes! finally eq will actually have a speedier logon and not the load times
of an old floppy disk based game of 1992&quot;.. then it just said a new online
store button was gona be put in... boy did that happiness fade..<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; bear in mind I'm not a lawyer either mind you<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Jeff, that's to save you from having to go to the store and pay
$40 for a $17 expansion (plus S&amp;H, the lawyer says)<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I just think it sets a really bad precedent that could go
beyond the gaming industry<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; JeffD&#02;,&#02; I think there really has to come a time when
you have to examine your life when your happiness or unhappiness is measured by
whats happening with a game<br>
&lt;Mystryxx_&gt; hahahaha mel<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Lum, I understand your concern.<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; Well considering that I've been a fan of two multiplayer games
that were trashed by cheating (being called a quake bot in every game I ever
played, and the starcraft map hack) I'm generally for any anti cheating measure
anyhow.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; That's why we're taking great pains to explain that any actions
will be very carefully circumscribed.<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; eek<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 107<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Maybe an additional paragraph in the EULA - even if not
legally required - stating what would be searched for and to what use it was
taken - would satisfy some of that concern<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; oh i misread that<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; dascott: thats the issue, really. do most players agree with you
that giving up some privacy is worth having a game with less cheating?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; well<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; it's more a question of &quot;is the game worth the loss of
privacy you suffer&quot;<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; I agree, but I never had my playing experience ruined by
cheaters before, and I would prefer to keep it that way<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; Aradune: yeah but those are the same people who think you are
collecting data to assimilate them into microsoft<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; agreed lum, same thing, i think<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I mean, if a game started downloading a list of progs I had
installed &quot;for marketing purposes&quot; I'd uninstall it in a heartbeat<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; but what &quot;real&quot; privacy are you losing?<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Lum, darn right.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; lum, so would i<br>
&lt;Toretzu&gt; Aradune- I really just question how much cheaters can do with
Everquest's design. And is it worth these resources and hastle<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; personally i'd trade any privacy you want if you let me ctrl-esc
from the game<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; heh<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; i'd really really like to be able to go afk, task switch and read
my mail etc<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; Toretzu: enough to get an advantage over other players,
basically<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; toretzu: thats the question, which is why we're here debating
it. if most players don't think its worth giving up the privacy then we're not
interested in doing it<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; ya thats the only coo thing about uo<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; you can put it into window mode and check irc or something<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; are you guys going to publish the poll results?<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; yeah<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; lum: i believe so, but its up to smed<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I think the poll is pretty badly worded btw<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; my main problem is i many times ctrl-esc by accident...i'm
ctrl-arrowkey'ing to target a mob, esc to clear target boom<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; oo a poll?<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; i go ld =/<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; but there's some good suggestions in that gameplay thread it
was on<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; lum: if you have a better wording, please send it to us. we're
all ears<br>
* Twiggy-2 dances around<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 106<br>
&lt;Toretzu&gt; DaScott: yeah, from my understanding of ShowEQ, it's neglible<br>
&lt;Toretzu&gt; Ok, diablo...<br>
*** Toretzu was kicked by kaiser (&#02;w&#02;ord&#02;k&#02;ick&#02;:&#02;
showeq? &#02;&lt;&#02;k&#02;!&#02;14&#02;&gt;&#02;&#15;)<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Lum, I played on Fennin Ro for a long time, before the server
split.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; And an awful lot of people couldn't get anything because people
would run around with ShowEQ and suck up all the rares.<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; why are we getting info about mobs that aren't in your general
location anyhow. I guess I'm used to quake's line of sight stuff..<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; hehe<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; well, before that they'd just get a pet druid<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; but yeah, SEQ is a huge problem<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; you are lucky you are voiced =)<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; or you would have gotten kicked when you said that horrid word
=)<br>
&lt;Druppy_&gt; EQ Caused me to fail a class, can i sue? ;)<br>
*** Druppy_ is now known as Druppy<br>
* Aradune is glad we have a legal director who is also a level 50 in EQ =)<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; and UOE really wasted about a year of UO's time<br>
&lt;Elementar&gt; SonyEsq - What about the legalitys of selling our everquest
accounts. Do you guys have plans to stop ebay selling for good. Or just have
that in the EULA to protect yourselves (which i understand is fair).<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Moreover...since people could see where the MOBs were at any
given point in time, zones like fear and hate would be easier for them.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; So you'd have a bunch of people, with the pullers running
ShowEQ, smoking those zones.<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; sony, big deal, the current fornt end is ass... #1 patch is slow,
#2 the program has an orgy with your video card befoee the EULA pops up, then
the 3 gay logo screens ..blah blah... id kill for a windoew based front end that
poped the eula, ran the patch, asked for logn and pass, gave a server list, and
then loaded eq all without having to load graphics and initizlize my graphics
card, something eq is a SLOTH at<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Verant would see those zones getting smoked, conclude that there
wasn't a challenge, and make em harder.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; So the people who didn't cheat would get reamed.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; (please note, this is from a player's perspective, not a
lawyer's perspective)<br>
* melusina nods<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I gotta take your word on all that, my highest level active
char is like lvl 14 :P<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; no rares for me!<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; yeah, we know you're a big eq fan lum :)<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; thats definitely a problem for us little people who struggle
and are only level 34 after over a year of playing =p<br>
&lt;Toretzu&gt; knowing when a monster spawns or having a map of the zone? How
much advantage can that really be<br>
&lt;Toretzu&gt; !!@# get reid of that wordkick already. getting old<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; but yes, I understand the problem<br>
&lt;Toretzu&gt; yay for lag<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; i'd like an answer to elementar's question btw<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; oh I play a bunch, I just suck at it<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; i'm curious myself about hwo far you intend to pursue the 'no
selling' rule<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; actually I don't see how it gives an advantage aside from item
farming really<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I'm antisocial, I hate to group<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; oh -- i thought you didn't care for it, but other guys on your
site did. sorry.<br>
&lt;Toretzu&gt; !!@# get reid of that wordkick already. getting old<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; heh, no, that's asherons call. I'm the only one on my site who
plays EQ I think<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; but item farming is bad enough. I mean I know a guy who
litereally does nothing but KS bilge and sell the loot on ebay<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; lum: ah, ok, sorry<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; yes item farming is a HUGE problem and no one is complaining
about the ebay part of this I don't think<br>
* melusina contemplates making asheron's call a wordkick too =p<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; well<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; and no one is saying &quot;Yes, give us the right to
cheat!&quot;<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; item farming for ebay gets on my nerves<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Toretzu, it's a great advantage.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Because you know without the feigner getting up, or doing
anything, where to grab singles (for instance)<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Also because you know at any point in time where the patrollers
are, and can avoid them without seeing them and aggro'ing them.<br>
&lt;Elementar&gt; To me the eBay issue is a big thing. I currently have 4
accounts I play. I bought these for hard cash and sometime in the future would
like to sell them again. If they have no value, I would just stop paying my
monthly fees for them and just keep the one I play.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; (By the way, I haven't really discussed with Brad my strong
feelings on ShowEQ)...we just happen to agree.<br>
&lt;Ivern&gt; i don't farm...i don't have the time for it and i don't find it
fun, but i HAVE sold surplus gear on ebay in the past i want to know if that
will be illegal from now on<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; I just hate cheating in a multiplayer environment. it hurts the
game, and it hurts the other players<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; SonyEsq: heh that's definately taking it to the extreme but I
can see that<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; we are just trying to protect the players<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; serever lag flood<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; and so the question is, are the players in general willing to
give up some privacy to be protected more against cheating<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; I think thats the crux of the issue<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; it just seems like the game wouldnt be fun if you had a program
like showeq<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; DaScott, I've seen it happen...honest.<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; If the level of privacy being given up is VERY CLEARLY
DEFINED, yes<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; My wife seriously is pissed that you potentially could snoop
our financials<br>
&lt;zer031&gt; I agree with what DaScott said a while back, we've seen other
games having their play value diminished with the use of 3rd party programs, and
therefore i can live with this change<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; oh btw... brad, uhmm... you guys all said this week you would be
updating the data files... why is the server downtime at 2 hours? I thought
these things take 5 or 6<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; lum: any program you use to access the net theoretically could<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; is what is sent back to Verant (process list, etc) encrypted
or sent plaintext?<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; I was in Hateplane before Brad screwed up the drops, and a
nonguild monk was suspiciously getting around the patrollers...we finally
figured out how...:)<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; we're saying that we have no interest in doing so<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; but *would* they Lum, and why *would* they? and what kind of
manpower would that take? I mean seriously...isnt that just taking paranoia to
an extreme?<br>
&lt;Elementar&gt; I personally wouldnt give up my privacy to play the game, but
thats just me. Others might. I think most 25 and over will seriously think about
it.<br>
&lt;Vap1d&gt; bleh anybody know if I can get eq working on win2k with a tnt2 vid
card? =\<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I'm not saying they WOULD melusina...<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; vap, get the latest beta drivers...<br>
&lt;Elementar&gt; Aradune &amp; SonyEsq - Anyway to give a short respose on the
eBay question?<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Lum, please remember the very narrow language.<br>
*** irc-w.frontiernet.net sets mode: +l 107<br>
*** irc-w.frontiernet.net sets mode: +v gentry<br>
&lt;Rub-A-Dub&gt; Is is true that scans such as the ones being discused now have
actually been happening all along?<br>
&lt;Vap1d&gt; just installed them eq is just saying no 3d device found when I
try to run it<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 106<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Verant does NOT seek, nor would it seek, permission to look at
your personal financial information.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; That information is none of anybody's business.<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; SonyEsq: heh.. they took away the amulet of necropotence
scouting method and it made hate no harder than it was before. I hope something
gets beefed up now that roamers are a slower spawn, because we've been killing
innoruuk in 2 1/2 hours on a full pop..<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; exactly my point<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; SonyEsq&#02;:&#02; i hate most of verants desisions but GRATS on
that ebay thing!<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; but now I&quot;m talking gameplay stuff and you aren't here for
that<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; vap, you messed something up... you want the detonator drivers btw<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; they have no reason to at all<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; i dont want to talk ebay, btw, but rather focus on the scanning
for cheating programs issue<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; just so we stay on topic<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I know. I'm giving that as an example of &quot;instant
reaction&quot;. Why some added text explaining what is meant by &quot;reasonable
discretion, interferes with Everquest&quot; would be helpful<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Well, Lum, a couple of reasons. First, there is simplicity in
brevity.<br>
&lt;Toretzu&gt; well, I agree that task scanning will slow down users of the
windows hacks... but it's not going to do much on the original linux version of
sh0weq<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Anything I were to add to the language would simply raise yet
more questions.<br>
&lt;Elementar&gt; Sorry. Just trying to figure out what I should do with my
extra accounts. If they have no cash value. why would I want to keep paying
$9.95 a month for them if I don't play them anymore. Heck, I have been paying
for 3 accounts for over 6 months and haven't played them at all but didn't
cancel cause they had real cash value.<br>

&lt;melusina&gt; Elementar&#02;,&#02; thats pretty much your own fault isnt it?<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Hey, look at the two new phrases. Count those words, man. Lucky
I'm not being paid by the word.<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; that's kinda what we're talking about Druppy<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; cool<br>
&lt;Elementar&gt; yep. guess it is. hehe, I am going to go shut them off right
now. =)<br>

&lt;DaScott&gt; may want to mention on some public forum that the only
&quot;cheat&quot; is recieving limited info on mobs. I hate listening to people
rant about cheats that don't exist<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; hehe<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; Here's another theoretical that you guys may not be able
to/want to answer...<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; You know, &quot;hey how did you hack yourself that last
name&quot;<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; people in general are idiots<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; they seem to flock to everlore<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; das, haha<br>
&lt;melusina&gt; they are everywhere Twiggy<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; SEQ is usually run on 2 PCs (1 for EQ one for SEQ). Any plans
to probe end user's networks looking for it?<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; yea<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; but i havent seen a gathering like everlore before<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; I don't even know if it's POSSIBLE mind you but that raises a
whole new can of worms I'd think<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; any item/spell has atleast two posts from complete idiots<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; really shoulden't be possible<br>
&lt;Druppy&gt; its not really possible to probe for SEQ because its a passive
intercepter<br>
&lt;Elementar&gt; SoneyEsq - Here is a pretty direct question on the EULA. Lets
say I have SEQ source code on my machine. Are you going to be banning for this.
I read before that you send back data about wether or not MSVC is running or
not.<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Lum, gonna let Brad answer that; I'm not technical enough to
answer it.<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; lum: we don't have any plans to search networks, and I don't
think the eula change says we reserve the right to either<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Elementar, all that Verant cares about at the present time is
whether you are running it. Not whether it is installed.<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; actually.. what I want to know.... is veeshan jus getting jipped
by big events? in a screen shot of that guy who first got the FA.. there was not
ne but TWO guys who had &quot;titles&quot;... and neither where dwarves so it
wasnt from the bb event... whats up with that?<br>
&lt;kaiser&gt; bah.. that program is a plague =/<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; he he he<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; he got the title for some random thing on a whim. Which is weird
because GM's basically say they aren't allowed to do so<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; &quot;at the present time&quot;<br>
&lt;kaiser&gt; makes my ranger useless =/<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; elementar: we are currently just looking at programs that are
running<br>
&lt;Elementar&gt; SonyEsq - So in actuality all you guys are going to be doing
is sending back the list of running programs (task list) right? Why don't you
just say that in the EULA, and avoid all this hastle?<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; That's really the whole point.... &quot;we reserve the right
to add things&quot;<br>
*** Leezard sets mode: +l 107<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; But Lum, remember -- they must be related to EQ, and they must
be reasonable. Judged objectively.<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; I still think it's not legally neccessary to display the EULA
every time you load the program.. should only pop up if changed<br>
&lt;SonyEsq&gt; Not judged by me, or Verant's CFO...but by a reasonable person.<br>
* LumTheMad isn't very reasonable<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; do you REALY have to agree every time esq?<br>
&lt;Toretzu&gt; DaScott- agreed.<br>
* Aradune noticed that :)<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; and yes we really are that lazy<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; heh<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; tab space is alot of keys<br>
&lt;Twiggy-2&gt; or enter depending on where the hand is when it pops up<br>
* Twiggy-2 goes on and on without a point<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; actually its not being lazy.. its the fact that everytime eq
crashes.. you ld.. or you lock up.. you have to go through the sloth known as
eq's frontend<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; that's all I have on the eula thing.. poll going up tomorrow?<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; poll should go up in the morning, yes<br>
&lt;Worth-&gt; Is the poll gonna matter?<br>
&lt;Rub-A-Dub&gt; what were the results from the last poll... regarding play
nice?<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; brad, you answer that Q about if the data files where being
patched today?<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; who do you sucker into doing an update at 5am? Narris? heh<br>
&lt;LumTheMad&gt; well I'm going to punch out and file my update, it's almost 4a
here... my wife has a few more questions I'm sure, she's even more concerned
about this than I<br>
&lt;Aradune&gt; rub: most didn't care, like over half. then it was like 2:1 in
favor of play nice<br>
&lt;JeffD&gt; narris is there fo revery update I hope..<br>
&lt;Rub-A-Dub&gt; Thanks.<br>
