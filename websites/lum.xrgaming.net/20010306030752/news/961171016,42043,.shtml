(It's called "How MinerD00D_00 Saved the MMORPG")<br><br>It, and similar solutions, are doomed to failure. Here's why.<br><br>Ultima Online was unique in many ways; the virtue of being the first mass-market MUD. (Pause while Kesmai and Meridian 59 partisans throw rotten eggs.) One of it's hallmarks was that it was basically a PK mud (players being allowed and in fact encouraged by game mechanics to kill one another) yet was marketed as anything <b>but</b> a PK mud. If you look at the original UO box or pretty much any incarnation since, you won't see many screenshots featuring PvP combat. Everything is either socialization or exploration - two of Bartle's four groups of game players. To summarize for those unfamiliar with <a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm">Bartle's work</a>, almost all players can be defined as being a member of one of four groups - achievers, explorers, socializers and killers. In UO terms, "PvMers" were a mix of achievers and explorers, "roleplayers" were socializers and, of course, "PKers" and "Antis" were killers. <a href="http://www.kaaos.com/scribery/scribery_6circles.htm">Other</a> <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/abm1.html">folks</a> have broken these groups down further, but the 4 groups work well for this piece.<br><br>Now, in Ultima Online, we saw all four of those groups being thrown together by virtue of many things - the small size of the online world, the contest for limited resources, and the "chokepoints" that formed outside of safe zones, such as the area outside of Trinsic gates and the crossroads west of Britain.<br><br>Now, no matter what side of the fence you were on then, the results were undeniable. As the wise men of Smash TV said, "TOTAL CARNAGE! I LOVE IT!" The killers won. Whether they wore red or blue, the killers won. They dominated the game, owned the game's resources, and killed other players at will, with the game rules serving as only minimal restraint. "Oh no! I'm a Dread Lord! Aagh!" UO was rapidly devolving towards Bartle's social model of what happens to a MUD with too many killers - no one is left, because the killers have killed everyone else. <br><br>UO's solution was to penalize killers (according to rumors I've heard, PKs were actually outright targeted for harassment and removal from the game by purposely "flawed" game mechanics at one point in UO's development) and cull their numbers down so that they would no longer dominate the game. This struggle continued throughout UO's existence, with further and further penalties levied against killers until finally, with UO:R, the world was split and player killing was prohibited in one half of the game. Ultima Online is basically two games right now - one, Felucca, aimed at killers (once the promised "Faction" political system is introduced), and one, Trammel, aimed at achievers and explorers, and by default, socializers, who tend to despise killers. (Thanks to spectacularly poor support in UO's early years, political conflict between killers and socializers - "PKers" and "roleplayers" - has reached the level of jihad, both inside and outside the game itself.) UO's final solution for its killer problem, then, was one of complete seperation. <br><br>Everquest's solution was to prohibit playerkilling except among playerkillers. This was an interesting theory, but was a complete failure in practice. To prevent interference in PK battles by non-PKs (healing, buffing, etc -- what in UO were called "blue healers") Everquest forbid nonPKs from casting any beneficial spell whatsoever on PKs. Since the vast majority of players in Everquest were nonPKs (many of them in fact refugees from Ultima Online and violently opposed to the PK concept) PKers thus found themselves unable to even change their bind point or ever be healed. You will almost never find a PKer in Everquest on the standard servers now, save those newbies who were unaware of the consequence of their actions. <br><br>Instead, EQ's PKs gravitated to the PK=only server, "Rallos Zek", which was set up almost as an afterthought, where everyone defaulted to PK status. This "PK Everquest" had many problems of its own, such as looting disparity creating an overabundance of "naked mages", or players without any difficult-to-obtain equipment on them. "Racewar PK" servers were established early in EQ's development, but suffered the same problems as the standard PK server. They still have a cadre of loyal users - at any time there are usually about 2000 people on all the EQ PK servers - and they in fact enjoyed a brief renaissance when due to massive overcrowding on other EQ servers players were actually willing to endure PKs to play on a less crowded server.<br><br>Still, Everquest's model for dealing with killers is, again, one of complete seperation - de facto, completely seperate servers. Everquest is skewed towards achievers in Bartle's model, with a literally insane amount of time and effort required to reach the pinnacle of achievment. There isn't much place for the killer in EQ.<br><br>Asheron's Call sought to modify Everquest's basically successful model to appeal to more killers while still protecting most of the playerbase from them. The regular servers still have a small community of PKs on them, since the game system is not as punitive towards PK/nonPK interaction, but their numbers are small and they cannot attack any other than other PKs. Instead, most PKs play on <a href="http://www.darktide.org/">Darktide</a>, AC's PK server. AC's PvP system, although flawed, is still superior to EQ's, and monarchies in AC have carved up the world into their own defended territories. In fact, Darktide at the moment is in a sort of stasis, as new players find it difficult to gain a foothold (many Darktide players actively hunt and kill new players, seeing it as some sort of "rite of passage" or, more simply, they make easier targets) yet older players are unable to really affect the status quo of entrenched monarchies. <br><br>So every major online RPG has dealt with PKs in the same way - complete seperation. Why? Well, it works. Ultima Online's early history shows that, given free reign, killers will dominate the game and drive away every other customer. It's the nature of the PK to hunt those weaker then themselves - and those are precisely the people who have no interest in being PK'd. The non-PKs will then kill the PKs - by leaving the game, by insisting that the game be changed, by petitioning the support system with example of the PK's antisocial behavior (examples most PKs are usually only too willing to provide) - thus enforcing the seperation themselves. UO's development, in large part, is the story of the non-PKs PKing the PKs. What PKs are left in UO now are usually bitter, anti-social, and to a man averring that the moment a better game for them is released, they are gone. Thus completing the seperation.<br><br><a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~cale/cs201/apartheid.hist.html">Apartheid</a>. It's a dirty word. But in this case, probably the only word that works. Going back to Riprend's essay, I read and find basically a blueprint for victimization. PKs can attack non-PKs here for this penalty, there for that penalty, etc. Unfortunatly, as long as the risk-reward ratio is skewed in the PK's favor, they will attack those weaker than themselves. It's the nature of the PK. No one wants to lose, after all. And if the risk-reward ratio is skewed against the PK, they simply won't play. An example is the "red PK", or PKs who ply their trade in UO despite the threat of stat loss should they lose. Very few PKs play red PKs for long - and those that do generally ensure that they attack only in numbers so overwhelming that their death is mathematically impossible.<br><br>Why, then, must PKs and their prey be kept apart? To do that, we must look at the nature of the PK. They are usually (not always) violently opposed to the thought of any play style other than their own. They are usually (not always) foul, crude, and obscene in game when presented with opposition, especially that which, thanks to game mechanics, they cannot immediately slay. They are usually (not always) exploiters, who will use any bug and any unfair advantage they can muster. They are usually (not always) deathly afraid of a fair fight, and will flee immediately if faced with one. And - what may be the most important - they are usually (almost always) in violent denial of the game as a community. When presented with their actions and asked to account for them, they reply that "IT IS ONLY A GAME!". To them, it <b>is</b> just a game. They are obviously not foul-mouthed anti-social murderers in real life. To them, this is a fantasy - their fantasy. They want to be dominant, they want power, more precisely power-over. They want to be the wolves.<br><br>The problem with this is two fold - the simple problem, of course, is that no one signs up for a game to be a sheep - a PK victim. This role is involuntary. No one volunteers to be killed. Thus those forced into that role tend to protest - a lot. <br><br>The more complex problem is the denial of the game as a community. When the PK denies the right of a community to exist - the unspoken stanza of "it's just a game" - they then, in their own eyes, legitimize their own assaults on it. They see themselves as opposed to the community they deny. In Ultima Online, still the only major MRPG with significant PK/nonPK interaction, one of the favorite PK targets is the player-run community - the taverns, the shops, the hangouts of the "roleplayers", the PK's hated enemy. Ask them why, and you'll get several different answers - because roleplayers are OSI's favorites, because they don't fight back, because they seek to be a roleplayed enemy, whatever. But the real reason is that the player-run community is the most visible sign of the game-as-community that the PK seeks to deny. The player-run community is an assault on the PK's world view. According to PKs, player-run communitys shouldn't exist. After all, it's just a game.<br><br>This is enormously interesting from a sociological standpoint, but being at ground zero in these wars isn't usually what most call fun. Thus the enforced seperation - the PK Apartheid. And sadly, until PKs as a group accept that MRPGs are in fact a community as well as a game, the walls will - must - remain.<br><br><a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showflat.pl?Cat=&Board=komments&Number=5487&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5">Comments?</a><br>
