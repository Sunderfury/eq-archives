      <p align="center"><font face="Merlin" size="5">The Ocean of Tears</font></p>
      <p><font face="Merlin">The Ocean of Tears, a vast Ocean, not very populated 
        at any given time, by the people of Norrath. There are Plenty of Beasts. 
        This is where I began my fascination for this Zone. Having found no maps 
        and only cryptic information. I began my quest for mapping and exploring 
        this Zone. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Merlin">I got on the boat in Freeport it was raining, windy 
        and well needless to say the trip was a rough one. The first Ilse the 
        boat stopped at once entering the zone Ocean of Tear (oot) is as I call 
        it the Sister's Ilse there is a vendor where you can buy food water and 
        various Drinks that aren't too common. The boat left me stranded on this 
        Ilse. So I was looking out on the horizon over the Ocean while sitting 
        on the docks. Behold barely visible to my eyes was an Ilse? Could it be? 
        So I cast a spell of breath underwater and set out on a swim. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Merlin">This is when I arrived to the Ilse of Goblins! When 
        a Goblin Shaman attacked me when I finally made it to Shore! Tired as 
        I was, I barely managed to survive the encounter. I thought to myself 
        "Oh Divine Light do you not you shine here?" I explored the rest of the 
        Ilse. I found Goblin Warriors, Ilse Goblin and Goblin Shaman. Upon close 
        inspection of these creatures I found only the shaman I could fight. While 
        resting on the a corner of this Vile Ilse I was able to see yet another 
        isle out in the horizon. That is When Khadgar Joined me. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Merlin">Khadgar followed my direction to the Goblin Isle. 
        From there we acquired a canoe and set off in the direction of the Ilse 
        I would name "The Un-Dead Ilse" Our canoe sprang a leak and we barely 
        made it to shore short of swimming to it. While I was catching my breath 
        Khadgar went to scout the area. He return shortly after with the look 
        of Fear in his eyes. I asked what did he see? All he could tell me is 
        "We MUST get OFF this Ilse I am scared!" after calming my friend down 
        a little he told me he saw Specters!?. not wanting to see these creature 
        of the dark we swam back to the Ilse of the Goblins. By this time it was 
        getting very late so we parted ways. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Merlin">In the morning I swam back to The Un-Dead Ilse. Where 
        I cast invisibility on myself and set about to take a picture of this 
        Specter? But before I managed to find the specters I was walking in the 
        middle of 5 Greater Skeletons! Fearing for my life I ran to a clear area. 
        Then while trying to catch my breath and my nerve something flew over 
        my head My heart nearly fell out of my throat! A stone Gargoyle! Now I 
        was really nervous not sure of myself. I continued when I found 4 Specters. 
        I came as close as I possibly dared (still invisible) and took the picture. 
        Now after successfully completing my task I ran/swam for my life. There 
        is no presence of any Divine light there. And I hope once our power grows 
        stronger that we cleanse this vile Ilse of its darkness. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Merlin">Back on the Sisters Ilse I saw yet again another 
        Ilse on the horizon. So I told myself there cannot be another vile Ilse 
        like the Un-Dead one so I venture toward the new one. Upon arriving I 
        cast invisibility and found myself walking among 8 Huge Cyclops and Ilse 
        goblins. So much to my dismay I found another Evil Ilse so I called this 
        Ilse "The Ilse of Cyclops" . </font></p>
      <p><font face="Merlin">This is where my story ends for now. And my incomplete 
        map has been posted. It shows the four Ilse I mention in the story but 
        please be careful if you decide to venture out here the Light does not 
        shine strong in the Ocean of Tears. </font></p>
