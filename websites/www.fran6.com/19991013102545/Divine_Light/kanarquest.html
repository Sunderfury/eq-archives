  <div align="left"><font face="Merlin">As requested, I visited the Qeynos Aquaduct 
    (Sewers). I found out that at my level, Dwarf, Palidin, Level 11, I was accompanied 
    by a Barbarian Shaman, that there are many perils down there. It is not to 
    be taken lightly. I found that there were around 14 bandits, smuglers and 
    thugs (including ring leaders). On the first floor, there are allagators, 
    skeletons, rats, gelatinouse cubes, spiders, spiderlings and a named skeleton 
    on the third floor. The levels of difficulties vary, at level 11 they conned 
    blue to red. Two NPC's that conned red and every time i went near them they 
    attacked me. One was and Oger and the other was a Human. I died to fast to 
    get there names, sorry. </font></div>

    <p align="left"> <font face="Merlin">I went on your quest as a level 17, Barbarian, 
      Warrior. First of all, let me say that you can not do this quest without 
      the help of a realy good magic user and or a shaman (healer). In order to 
      get to the cavern, you need someone that can do the water breathing spell 
      (which you need 2 fish scales apiece for to complete the spell). Then you 
      have to find a hole in the ice and jump in and make sure you going in the 
      right direction to get to the cavern entrance which you can see under the 
      ice. Just getting to the entrance is perilouse to start. At the entrance, 
      you will meet at least 1 goblin diver, sometimes as many a 3. They weren't 
      to bad, but fighting under water is an experience in its own right. Then 
      the hard part begins. There is not a lot of NPC's that will attack you in 
      there, but when you start to attack them they can do many levels of serious 
      harm with magic. All that we found in the caverns was Ice Bone Skeletons 
      that range from blue to red and a level 40 Necromancer who needless to say 
      we didn't bother for fear of becoming one of his subjects, bones and all. 
      We went down as a party of 4, a shaman, druid, warrior and myself. All have 
      to have at least one magic weapon or use magic to kill everything except 
      the Divers and the Necromancer.</font></p>
