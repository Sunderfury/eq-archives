        <p><font face="KellyAnnGothic" size="7">I</font><font face="Merlin">t 
          was a beautiful day. And I had decided that today, I would try and earn 
          enough money to go </font><font face="Merlin">and get my an IceBear 
          Cloak from Karg IceBear in</font> <font face="Merlin">the Tundra. I 
          know I would need a lot of money. 5</font> <font face="Merlin">platinum 
          and a Polar Bear Skin is the going price, I</font> <font face="Merlin">believe. 
          And earning money means stomping Gnolls </font><font face="Merlin">and 
          lots of them. So to prepare for this venture, I </font><font face="Merlin">needed 
          to stock up on some spell reagents. Snake </font> <font face="Merlin">scales 
          are needed in order for me to call upon the </font><font face="Merlin">protection 
          of the Snake Spirit. My adventure started</font> <font face="Merlin">slow, 
          with me bashing every snake I could find in </font><font face="Merlin">North 
          Qeynos so I could get some scales. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Merlin">While I </font><font face="Merlin">was bashing 
          snakes, a small boy ran up to me and </font> <font face="Merlin">asked 
          if I was the Shaman named Bayne. I stated </font> <font face="Merlin">that 
          this was I. He then delivered to me a telegram. </font><font face="Merlin">I 
          gave him a few copper and he ran off. I opened </font><font face="Merlin">the 
          telegraph and there were scribbles all over this </font><font face="Merlin">piece 
          of paper that I could not quite make out. I took</font> <font face="Merlin">it 
          to the Front Gate and found someone that was </font> <font face="Merlin">kind 
          enough to make some sense of the scribbles. </font> <font face="Merlin">They 
          told me that the note said that Belgar had just</font> <font face="Merlin">arrived 
          in South Qeynos on the boat and that he </font><font face="Merlin">looked 
          forward to meeting with me if he could. I </font><font face="Merlin">thanked 
          this person very kindly and called upon the</font> <font face="Merlin">Spirit 
          of the Wolf to run beside them for a while on </font><font face="Merlin">their 
          journey. I dashed off to South Qeynos to find </font><font face="Merlin">my 
          Guild Brother. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Merlin">I found him over at the Magic </font><font face="Merlin">Guild. 
          The people were quite rude to me there and I </font><font face="Merlin">told 
          him I would not stay there and was leaving. He </font><font face="Merlin">thought 
          it was funny but agreed to leave with me. </font><font face="Merlin">After 
          we left that place of rude people, we said our </font><font face="Merlin">hellos 
          and shook hands and hugged. He said that he </font><font face="Merlin">had 
          some Brandy and that we should toast our </font><font face="Merlin">meeting 
          for the first time. I had never had any </font><font face="Merlin">Brandy 
          and said that sounded delightful. He gave me </font><font face="Merlin">a 
          shot glass and took one out for himself and </font><font face="Merlin">produced 
          a large bottle of Brandy. Pouring me a </font><font face="Merlin">glass 
          first and then himself. We clinked glasses and </font><font face="Merlin">downed 
          the brew. Fire shot up and down my throat. </font><font face="Merlin">I 
          couldn't help but cough. Belgar did his with hardly </font><font face="Merlin">a 
          wince and said that it "was an acquired taste". </font></p>
        <p><font face="Merlin">After a moment I started to feel a little </font><font face="Merlin">funny. 
          But a good kind of funny. I asked him if he </font><font face="Merlin">had 
          enough for another. He said that he had plenty </font><font face="Merlin">for 
          us and poured us both another drink. Drinking </font><font face="Merlin">this 
          one wasn't so bad but after a moment, I felt </font><font face="Merlin">like 
          someone had thumped me on the head real good. </font><font face="Merlin">Both 
          he and I started to teeter and wobble. I had no </font><font face="Merlin">sense 
          of balance. I stumbled over to a wall to lean </font><font face="Merlin">against 
          it for fear I would fall over. Belgar was </font><font face="Merlin">standing 
          on a busy thoroughfare and stumbled back </font><font face="Merlin">and 
          forth as people tried to walk past him. Belgar </font><font face="Merlin">told 
          me that he didn't feel so good and needed to go </font><font face="Merlin">get 
          some food. I told him not to waste his money. </font><font face="Merlin">That 
          I would call upon the spirits to bring us some </font><font face="Merlin">food. 
          My mind was a mess, I could not think </font><font face="Merlin">straight. 
          I had to sit down and ponder how it was </font><font face="Merlin">that 
          I did call upon the spirits to bring us some food. </font><font face="Merlin">It 
          came to me after a moment and I stood up and </font><font face="Merlin">managed 
          to somehow slur my way through the </font><font face="Merlin">incantation. 
          I had miscalculated and summoned so </font><font face="Merlin">much 
          food and water that it all fell out of my hands </font><font face="Merlin">and 
          onto the ground. Belgar started to bend over to </font><font face="Merlin">pick 
          it up and almost fell on his face. He said he </font><font face="Merlin">would 
          have to get it in a minute, once he got his </font><font face="Merlin">balance 
          back. My balance was completely gone, so I </font><font face="Merlin">sat 
          back down. My head was spinning and Belgar </font><font face="Merlin">was 
          standing there swaying back and forth looking </font><font face="Merlin">at 
          the food and water on the ground just out of his </font><font face="Merlin">reach. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Merlin">A passerby stopped and started to pick up the </font><font face="Merlin">food 
          and water and put it in his own pack. I </font><font face="Merlin">couldn't 
          think fast enough to say anything and all </font><font face="Merlin">Belgar 
          could do was say "Hey, thash ma ffffd n </font><font face="Merlin">wash." 
          The person looked at Belgar perplexed, </font><font face="Merlin">shrugged 
          his shoulders and left. I must have blacked </font><font face="Merlin">out 
          because the next thing I knew, I found myself </font><font face="Merlin">laying 
          down behind a building in another part of </font><font face="Merlin">town. 
          My head throbbed like I really had been </font><font face="Merlin">thumped 
          on the head. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Merlin">Belgar was nowhere to be </font><font face="Merlin">seen. 
          I got my bearings and went back to were I </font> <font face="Merlin">thought 
          we last were together but he was no longer </font><font face="Merlin">there. 
          I don't know how long it had been, but it did</font><font face="Merlin">seem 
          like quite a while from when we took those </font><font face="Merlin">drinks. 
          I searched all over for him but could not find </font><font face="Merlin">a 
          trace. I hope he is O.K. I look forward to our </font><font face="Merlin">meeting 
          again, but next time I think it will be over </font><font face="Merlin">some 
          of that hot Honey Tea that I have found to be </font><font face="Merlin">quite 
          tasty.</font> </p>
