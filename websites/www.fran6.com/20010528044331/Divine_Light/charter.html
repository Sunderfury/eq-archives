    <p><font face="Merlin" color="#FFCC00">Codex:</font><font face="Merlin"> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin">1. Role-playing is the guild's primary tenet. Maintaining 
      a role-playing atmosphere is of primary concerns to guild members. /OOC 
      should be kept to an absolute minimum, and /tell should be used as a replacement 
      when at all possible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin">2. Members will treat others as they would wish others 
      to treat them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin">3. Guild members will offer aid to other adventurers 
      who may need it, and will provide aid if it is requested. Oftentimes guarding 
      someone to prevent other NPC's from entering a fight, or taunting an NPC 
      to draw it off, will be sufficient. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin">4. The helping of new players will be left at the discretion 
      of the members involved. This will be encouraged but not required. Guild 
      members are encouraged to give aid to younger guild members, but not at 
      the expense of learning and normal progression on the part of the younger 
      member. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin">5. Members will be obliged to uphold the basic goodness 
      on this server. If a PC or NPC is picking on or disrupting a PC character, 
      regardless of alignment, every effort should be made to protect the offended 
      party. The reasoning is that every criminal deserves a trial before punishment. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin" color="#FFCC00">Meetings:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin">Meetings will be held bimonthly online at a pre-posted 
      time and place set by the guild. A quick visit to the guild homepage will 
      have all of the information needed. Attendance at meetings is strongly encouraged, 
      but not mandatory. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin" color="#FFCC00">Dues: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin">Dues can be paid monthly in moneys or crafts. Dues 
      will be based on character level. The formula will be level/5*1pp. Guild 
      dues will be kept by the treasurer and used based on decisions of the guild 
      council. Payment to the treasurer may be made at regular guild meetings, 
      or wherever possible if meetings cannot be attended.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin" color="#FFCC00">Current members: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin">Once a character is a member, they will always be a 
      member, with the exception of crimes being committed, etc. Should a guild 
      member commit acts contrary to the code of conduct of the order, that member 
      will be judged by the guild officers, and may be removed at the officers' 
      discretion. If a member quits the guild voluntarily, and wishes to return 
      to the order, they must go through all of the trials of becoming a member 
      again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin" color="#FFCC00">New Members: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Merlin">New members will not necessarily be actively sought 
      out. The guild will concentrate its efforts on its mission, building it's 
      reputation as a good and noble organization that people will be drawn to 
      in times of need, desperation, and guidance. The Ortis are the only exception 
      to this rule. Our member base will come from those who see what we are accomplishing 
      and have a desire to help. Initiates will be required to join under the 
      following circumstances: </font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Merlin">1. They must have a Mentor. This can either be 
            a guild member they already know, or one will be assigned to them. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Merlin">2. They must spend at least 6 hours of game time 
            adventuring and communicating with at least the Mentor and one other 
            guild member. These hours should be spread among at least 2, and preferably 
            </font><font face="Merlin">3, individual gaming sessions. Interaction 
            with other guild members during this time is encouraged, but not required. 
            In the case of players whose online time is limited, the number of 
            hours may be reduced at the discretion of the officers. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Merlin">3. Upon completion of the required hours, the 
            initiate must complete a trial as deemed worthy by the guild council. 
            The Mentor, who will petition the Guild Council in the initiate's 
            name, will oversee this task. </font> </p>
