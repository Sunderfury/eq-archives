      <p><font size="+1" color="#800080"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Uh, 
        Officer? I don't mean to objectify you, but would you mind posing for 
        a photo with my sister?&quot;</font></b></font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#800080"> 
        </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, yes. I was finally 
        pulled over for speeding, but as anyone who drives with me can tell you, 
        once in 3400 miles ain't too shabby.The cop was extremely polite and far 
        more sociable than anyone we had met in the last two thousand miles, unlike 
        the scary-as-fuck Connecticut state troopers. I can almost begin to understand 
        fantasies about being pulled over by police officers. Not fully, though, 
        since men in uniform give me the creeps. Actually, <i>anyone</i> in uniform 
        gives me the creeps. Especially girl scouts. </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And yes, I really did say 
        those exact words. What the hell is LIDAR anyway? </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This really was a weird 
        fucking day. We tried to see the Mormon temple, just because I thought 
        it would be a hoot. The brochure about Salt Lake city provided by AAA 
        was strangely tongue in cheek about the father of the Mormons and his 
        angel, Moroni. Suffice it to say, sometimes religious persecution is a 
        good thing.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We had 253 exits before 
        Zion National park, all through flat, flat-as-fuck land covered in scrub.As 
        our cop said, &quot;The biggest accident on this highway is that the land 
        is so boring drivers fall asleep at the wheel.&quot; Sometimes we'd see 
        mountains with big white letters on them for the town nearbye. More often 
        we would see thunderstorms, hundreds of miles out, which we wound up driving 
        through.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We stopped at a rest stop 
        where a toothless not so old woman begged for food or money for her and 
        four teenage sons, who were working on their old white car, trying to 
        get it to run. I gave Sabrina five dollars to give to her, and the old 
        woman asked if I was her mother. </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We drove into Kolob Canyon, 
        which was spectacular, but not Zion, as we found out belatedly. It was 
        perfectly silent with no people and huge-ass red mountains and rock formations.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Knowing Lexi (that's her 
        Vegas name) would kick my ass, we still decided to take the time and do 
        a quick drive into Zion, which was definitely worth it. Of all the National 
        Parks we've been to this trip, this was the most spectacular. It wasn't 
        just the mile long tunnel carved into the rock. It wasn't just the world's 
        largest freestanding arch carved naturally into orange rock. It wasn't 
        just the bright red buttes and weird stone shapes.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was a small bowl, on 
        the other side of the tunnel, filled with pink sand soft as powder. It 
        was the dead silence and ancient sounding wind. It was silver desert driftwood 
        and twisted old trees. It was half of the sky blue with white puffy clouds, 
        the other half black with thunderheads and lightening that didn't so much 
        strike as drop down like quicksilver from the sky.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were very sad to leave.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, I have to admit, I 
        have really not been looking forward to going to Vegas. I don't like gambling 
        or talking to the type of men that go to Vegas (no offense, Ken; you know 
        what I mean). My mind was full of silence and nature, as cheesey as that 
        sounds, and I had no desire to return to civilization, especially one 
        that involves neon, slot machines, and really ugly white people.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it's my friend Lexi's 
        (that's her Vegas name) birthday.</font></b></p>
      <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2" color="#660099">HAPPY 
        BIRTHDAY ALEXIS!</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So we ate 
        dinner in the strangely San Franciscan town of Zion, a civilized meal 
        of pasta and espresso. The sunset on the way out was spectacular, and 
        we saw what I think was a moonbow: a pale milky light arch that stretched 
        across the sky between the halfmoon and the sunset.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Driving to 
        Vegas at night was trippy: there were large black mountains and canyons 
        all around us, barely visible against the black sky, a clear moon and 
        stars, thunderstorms on left and right racing against us to Sin City. 
        It was like something out of the Dream Quest of Unknown Kaddath, a thousand 
        apologies to the Old Gent and Tyler if I have spelled it wrong.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although we 
        were exhausted we went out with Lexi and Jennifer, part of which involved 
        a birthday toast in the Voodoo Lounge at the top of the Rio, on the roof 
        watching more thunderstorms.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So that wasn't 
        too bad.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maybe - just 
        maybe - me backhanding the guy who grabbed me was, however.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sabrina's too sense:</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="000099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>We saw a 
        lot of skinks in Zion National Park which kind of reminded me of the red 
        effs I came so well aquainted with in middle-of-east-nowhere-Massachusetts 
        (Dave, Amanda and Trevor- you know what I'm talking about) Zion really 
        did kick Yellowstone's ass. It really did. </b></font></p>
      <p><font color="000099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Anyways, 
        about getting the smack down by the man- all I want to say about that 
        is, &quot;Who the hell does he think he's kidding?!&quot; At one point 
        Liz couldn't see where she had to sign for the ticket. He replied, &quot;Right 
        next to the 'X'...that's what we call our visual aid for people from Arkansas.&quot; 
        Oh yeah, a state police officer from UTAH really has EVERY right to make 
        fun of people from Arkansas. Utah is high up on the state food chain. 
        I think anywhere with that many mormons has no right to make fun of anybody...but 
        that's just my unbiased judgment. By the way- is it a bad thing if you 
        can't tell if the group of women standing on a street corner in Salt Lake 
        are high paid prostitutes, a travelling a capella rock singing group, 
        or members of a mormon polygamous marriage? Just a thought.</b></font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="000099">One last 
        thing- Mormons really are funny. Even more so than typical midwesterners 
        and Germans. No, I take that back; nothing is funnier than Germans. </font></b></p>

        We'll tell you this much:<font color="#990000"> <i>not Canadian.</i> </font>That 
        includes all Canadian sub-ethnicities.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Travis was not our waiter 
        again at the Three Bears. We saw Old Faithful first thing, waiting around 
        in the white hot sun on white hot pavement behind benches covered with 
        all sorts of ugly tourists, of all ethnicities. I guess it was spectacular, 
        but like Episode 1, greatly overhyped. As it sputtered down and out one 
        little girl cried in dismay, &quot;Dad! Old Faithful is losing its faithfulness!&quot;</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the same tradition of 
        the lack of any info at Rushmore about why he did it, the Yellowstone 
        brochure describing its lakes as tranquilizing, and not a single ranger 
        knowing what the little beeping rodent I saw was, there was nary a sign 
        saying how often Old Faithful blew.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We drove south through Yellowstone 
        and then through the Grand Tetons, which like Shoshone quite frankly kicked 
        Yellowstone's ass. We saw a badger crossing the road, and were once again 
        honked at by an idiot local who couldn't figure out how to pull around 
        us on an empty highway when we stopped to look at the animal.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We stopped for lunch in 
        Jackson Hole after countless stops on the mountains for construction. 
        It is a pity we didn't get a shot of the cowboy hat wearing old truckdriver 
        who was nibbling huckleberries off the branch like a ground squirrel, 
        but Sabrina did manage to capture a moment out of time, an old dude in 
        a pink shirt stretching.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jackson Hole was yuppie 
        to the max and hard to navigate through. Also, there were antlers every 
        where. Goth and interesting, but a little dissonant next to the Polo Ralph 
        Lauren outlet.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People drive the speed limit 
        exactly in Idaho.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Idaho was lumpy little green 
        potato hills and then flat stretches of 65 mph highway interrupted often 
        by 35 mph noxious little poor towns. In almost every town their cop car 
        would see our NY plates and follow us carefully, at a distance, until 
        we were gone. I can only imagine what it must be like driving cross country 
        when you're African American.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My mind was wiped once again 
        by a strenuous drive through Cache National forest, which was beautiful 
        and smelled strongly of pine, but again hard to navigate and a little 
        too damn slow. My biggest problem on the trip has been not being able 
        to look around, forced to keep my eyes on the road.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We drove around Bear Lake, 
        an incredibly blue/green thing with rich developments on the shore and 
        frighteningly poor houses just across the street in the fields. There 
        was even an old shuttered up victorian, looking like it was going blow 
        down in the wind.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We stopped for dinner at 
        a restaurant called Country Grill where everyone was blond and people 
        actually turned their heads to stare at us. As you may have been able 
        to guess by reading, we grow more and more irritable at this treatment.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The best was after we checked 
        into the Salt Lake City Ramada, however. It had a central area with bar, 
        pool, pool tables, lounge, ping pong and a hot tub. It was in this hot 
        tub we actually talked to other people, who told us flat out they hated 
        New York, and that they were 'just country people.'</font></b></p>

      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A word or two here about 
        our observations on Midwesterners. Our entire life Sabrina and I have 
        been making fun of them because that's just what you do, it's taken for 
        granted on the east coast. We thought that would change when we actually 
        visited them and spoke to them and realized what prejudiced assholes we 
        had been. Here is what we learned:</font></b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They are all very blond.</font></b></li>
        <li><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They all <i>really </i>hate 
          New York.</font></b></li>
        <li><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They can't drive for 
          shit.</font></b></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are just the basics 
        of course. We could add how odd it is that every restaurant we've been 
        to out here puts a carafe of icewater on the table first thing. Or how 
        when you ask for the check to be brought with the meal 'cause you're in 
        a hurry they look at you with confused, big eyes. Or how they can only 
        drive in the straight lines that God and their D.O.T. gave them; without 
        fail whenever I pulled over to the side of the road, signal or blinkers 
        on, the car behind me would just sit there, even if there was no traffic 
        coming the other way and they had twenty feet of road on the other side 
        of me. They begin to honk and then <i>swear</i> as I sit, confused with 
        big eyes, unable to understand why they don't just pull around. Also, 
        the church-to-coffeeshop/restaurant ratio out here is higher than in the 
        Vatican. </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I'm not kidding about 
        the New York thing. If a waiter or local asks us smilingly where we are 
        from and we tell them the truth, we get scowls and the silent treatment. 
        It got so bad by the end of this day that we resorted to telling people 
        we were from Rhode Island and speaking in a made-up clicking language 
        to each other whenever it looked like someone was going to talk to us.</font></b></p>

        beauty, which has nothing to do with the human inhabitants of the area.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We blew our minds out with 
        light and heat by going to Mammoth Springs first, at the top of the park, 
        near the entrance. It became as weird as a Flannery O'Conner short; desolate 
        with funny looking tourists and a sun that ate our brains out. Basically, 
        they were pretty hot springs out of white travertine with bacteria-stained 
        blue, red, and green crusts. We ate some ice cream to try to cool off 
        and reawaken our heads but nothing occurred until we stopped at a river 
        and dipped our feet in far from the maddening crowd.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then we found a rock bowl 
        which Sabrina climbed around on while I sat in the shade, and a golden 
        marmot actually crawled out on the rock next to me to see what was going 
        on. Also, one of those little beeping things that no ranger could identify 
        came out and, uh, beeped at me. And <i>then</i> an old biker drove up, 
        clad in chaps with spurs chinkling in the dust, and he laid out on his 
        hawg with a cigarette in one hand a map of the park in the other. It was 
        a pretty magical moment, all things concerned.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Sabrina theorizes that 
        this is where all the cowboys have gone; they became Hell's Angels)</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Feeling much better we proceeded 
        to the Norris Geysers, which were beautiful but smelled bad. Some of the 
        pools were an intense acquamarine that defy description. No wait, I just 
        did describe it. They definitely defied my light meter, though, which 
        is why we have no pictures.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally we made our way 
        to Fountain Paint Pot, a sort of a 'good' version of the Bog of Eternal 
        Stench, all white and bubbling and smelling foul. We also met the Bacteria 
        Mat(t), whom I got a picture with since he/they seemed to be the nicest 
        of the locals we met. There were sprays of steam and strange bleached 
        bones strewn around the think white thermal crust. A thunderstorm was 
        coming in, too.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Creepy, no?</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On our way out of the park 
        my freakish eyes spotted a pair of <i>trumpeter swans,</i> which I have 
        wanted to see since I read the book by E.B. White. I was rapturous, staring 
        through my binoculars for a very long time. White with black beaks and 
        feet! Just the way I imagined them, too.</font></b></p>

      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="000099">Liz asked 
        a very interesting question regarding where do all the Harley riders go 
        when it rains. I have prepared answer. The Harley riders zip up their 
        special leather jackets and speed their way to the magical paint pots. 
        These are not the paint pots that Liz and I trudged around exclaiming, 
        &quot;Errr, cool. Too bad it smells like ass,&quot; These paint pots are 
        the magical kind. They are exceedingly beautiful with rainbow stripes 
        and polka-dots and smell like fresh cut lilac. The elusive elk and mule 
        deer prance around this landscape and eat from the candy-cane bushes and 
        poo Skittles. The Harley riders then dismount from their chrome steeds 
        and pull out their lyres and fifes and play the most soothing and wonderful 
        music. The Harley riders sit happily telling stories of love and friendship, 
        infinite compassion and world social issues. When the rain stops outside 
        in the real world they belch, scratch themselves and go back to the real 
        world more refreshed and alive then stopping at a Country grill for an

        I love dollies. You're also lucky you're not with me, 'cause I would have

        I mention he's a mechanical genius? Uh oh...he's building a red light

        Phonelessness at the Bates Motel took us out for one night and we've been

      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two big rules we should 
        have obeyed when visiting the mother of all National Parks:</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Don't go to Bear Country 
        USA first to see in captivity up close all the animals you would die to 
        see wild in Yellowstone. </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Don't take route 212/the 
        Beartooth Loop or you'll wear out your capacity for wonderment thirty 
        miles before you ever <i>hit</i> Yellowstone.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for Shoshone and Custer 
        Parks... Mighty Fuck! I didn't know mountains got that big. I mean <i>Christ 
        on a rubber crutch</i> the land was unbelievable. Sure you can call me 
        lowbrow for resorting to cheap four letter words, but if I said I was 
        speechless with the inherent majesty of the land it would sound boring 
        and lame.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From down in the canyon 
        we couldn't see the top, but we saw a road above us and were envious. 
        Suddenly we realized<i> that </i>was what our road became, and we could 
        see the mountains became flat, and we were puzzled. Finally we were at 
        the top, driving on top of these huge alpine fields, plateaus, like land 
        that was replaced half a mile above where it should be. Fields of flowers 
        and snow and these strange little chinchilla-like creatures that beeped. 
        No, I did not take any out with my bootknife. I said they were<i> like 
        </i>chinchillas.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At one point we just got 
        out and sat and stared for a long time. At another point we went down 
        a flower-covered prairie to get a closer look at a beautiful mere. Sabrina 
        made fun of my random hand clapping and shouting <i>Bear Bear</i> at first, 
        claiming that bears like forest, not fields. I was however justified when 
        we got back up to the road again and saw a sign we had missed warning 
        that it was grizzly country.</font></b></p>

        the other side into a glorious golden valley replete with sparkling pebble-strewn 
        rivers, we were, uh, done with the day. We were tired and blinded by the 
        snow and beauty, and found ourselves pushing past some of Yellowstone's 
        attractions at high speed. We didn't even get out for one waterfall, and 
        the only reason we paused at the famous Tower Junction Waterfall was because 
        of a busload of, um, really cute guys of a certain ethnicity that the 
        Braswell sisters both appreciate.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yeah, we saw bison and geysers

        trees, and bacterial mats (yes, that is what you think they are, fields

        The only reason it <i>wasn't </i>the Bates Motel was because (as Sabrina 
        pointed out) we were in South Dakota, not California. Scary as shit psycho 
        central. Anyone remember the Cereal Convention issue of Sandman?</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We crammed in a little bit 
        too much today for any sane mind to handle comfortably. The yellow sign 
        was probably in a corn crop circle and Yog Sothoth has nothing on midwest 
        tourist traps, for instance.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(hey there, natives, we'll 
        take Manhattan for 24 bucks, and move a bit westward...a friendly word 
        or two and suddenly we've fenced in all the fucking prairies and stuck 
        signs up everywhere that say things like WallDrug and Reptile Garden and 
        Cosmos Mysteries: It's Crazy!)</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We started with prairie, 
        which was so unbelievably alien to us eastcoasters that we stopped multiple 
        times to take photos. I have to say, I used to think the midwest would 
        come to me at night only in the form of nightmares, but this land was 
        like something out of half-remembered dreams, the kind you wake up from 
        with a sad but eerily exalted feeling. White light, infinite grass.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then we went to the Corn 
        Palace. All that can really be said about it is that corn architectural 
        technology seems to have declined since the original Corn Palace in 1892, 
        which had spires and onion domes. The one today just has a weird Logan's 
        Run-ish gift shop in the middle of an auditorium, with tired fat white 
        people sitting in front of a giant tv/vcr gone all blue from rewind, waiting 
        to learn about the wonders of corn.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We skipped the enchanted 
        doll world and the balloon museum, pausing just long enough to snap a 
        photo of a sign which said Jabba The Hutt Buys His Garage Doors Here.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We renewed our souls next 
        to a field of sunflowers stretching on to the ends of the earth. We also 
        got horribly tan and freckled, the prairie sun burnng the east coast out, 
        I guess.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our main stop that day, 
        the one I had been looking forward to since New Jersey, was the Badlands. 
        Holy bric-a-brac of Christ was it beautiful and unusual. If you took all 
        the weird rock formations in a Roadrunner cartoon and squished them together 
        in one small area, there you would have it. As sunset approached they 
        even took on that dreamy orange pink color.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Being adults we exercised 
        our perogative in expensive capricious whimsy, in this case a helicopter 
        ride over the Badlands in a tiny white dragonfly version of an army copter. 
        It kicked ass. We then proceeded to rejoice in our guardianless state 
        by climbing <i>all over</i> the formations, teetering on ledges and going 
        higher than the biker guys did.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We drove out of the Badlands 
        at sunset, just beginning to grasp the concept of the Big Sky, and dined 
        in Walldrug that evening. Thank you Ken and Scott for the recommendation. 
        For people who have been, you know what we're talking about. For those 
        who haven't, you just have to go and see it for yourself. Imagine Disneyland 
        without the rides or the franchise.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We drove like mofos to Rapid 
        City, catching a glimpse of a fantastic sputtering meteor which arced 
        across the night.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sabrina's too sense:</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="000099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>I would like 
        to say that if there ever was another surreal day such as this one again 
        in my life I`d come to the conclusion that some higher force was trying 
        to tell me something (and then I`d become a muttering crazy lady with 
        too many cats). This has been an action and adventure packed day what 
        with The Corn Palace, the Enchanted Doll Kingdom, the Amish, the helicopter 
        ride without the safety instructions, the Badlands, the entire bag of 
        turkey jerky, the Harley motorcycle gang frolicking in the prairie, the 
        uppity upstate New Yorkers who acted like Buffalo was a far superior city 
        to New York City, and the Wall Drug store that only sold Jackalope themed 
        souvenirs. You'd think that this was all weird enough for one day, but 
        we topped it off by eating Buffalo burgers and staying in a motel VERY 
        reminiscent of the Bates Motel from psycho. Liz and I are currently having 
        a stand off on who will shower first...I hope this gets resolved quickly.</b></font></p>

        pleasant morning under unbelievably bright blue sky and sun with Sabrina's 
        friend Paul and his brother John. We had pancakes and were introduced 
        to suburbia midwest style when a guy with a tan polo shirt and raybans 
        hung artistically on his chest loudly kissy-kissed people in the booth 
        next to us and his gold clutch toting wife remarked on how cute breakfast

        is hot, flat, and ugly - for an hour there it looked like my agoraphobia 
        was about to screamingly kick in. Then clouds began to pass, huge clouds, 
        sky covering clouds. And the sky out here really is big. 270 degrees of 
        clouds, different formations everywhere you looked, like gazing up from 
        the bottom of a snowglobe.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the land began to change. 
        For several hours we passed through Homer Winslow light in a more rolling 
        landscape: fields and picture perfect barns, silos twenty miles apart 
        or more. The land began to unflatten itself more, and the trees were dark 
        and square grey rectangles of stone would occasionally stand up against 
        the sky. Whereas yesterday was all Bowie all the time, 13 hours of cds, 
        tapes, and singalongs, this afternoon we were silent. A sort of serenity 
        settled over the car and we ate up the miles like Grays hot dogs.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After hundreds of miles 
        of signs for Wisconsin cheeses and Amish stuff, we pulled over in LaCrosse 
        to see what local life was like, for dinner. Local life was dead, Lutheran, 
        or both, as evidenced by the empty streets and multitude of cemeteries. 
        LOTS of beer halls. A lawn of white crosses which whimsically reminded 
        me of the cruciforms in Hyperion turned out to be an 'abortion' faux burial 
        ground. We did not tarry in LaCrosse, but did stay long enough to eat 
        at one of those diners where a waitress rollerskates out and puts your 
        order on a tray, on your car door. It pretty much ruled. The sky was grey 
        and rain fell now and again. It felt a lot like in New England at Thanksgiving 
        except for all of the antiabortion signs.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At night we picked up even 
        more speed - the limit is 75 in Minnesota. We drove to the moon, which 
        hung in the sky like a cartoon of itself, a crescent unbelievably bright 
        and alone. The stars in the big sky were as they say too numerous to count 
        and heat lightening followed us on the south until we hit Sioux Falls. 
        For hundreds of miles we were the only car. The gas stations are well
