      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We got up late and went 
        to a breakfast buffet at Treasure Island. I'm not usually a fan of such 
        staples of middle american eating-out fare, but after ten days or so on 
        the road with nothing but burgers and chicken fried steak, the salad bar 
        was a blessing. Caught up and talked about old times with my oldest friend 
        Lexi and her friend Jennifer, who is a sarcastic, spunky, gruff son of 
        a bitch. Loved her instantly.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We explored the Venetian, 
        a new casino, which from the inside looks like all the others but on the 
        outside looks like St. Marco's and the Rialto and tiny gondolas and chlorinated-water-sipping 
        mini-swans. I don't remember any swans in Venice, but that was probably 
        because they were eatten by the locals.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sabrina and I, no gamblers 
        we, veered off to explore a few other casinos like the Mirage, where we 
        saw the white tigers.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We met back again with them 
        at the Flamingo and Barbary Coast where I was learned Pai Gow real good 
        and lost pretty damn fine. We returned to Maxim's for a short siesta and 
        then I actually dressed up to go out. Sabrina, Lexi and I went to Caesar's 
        for dinner and Luxor's to explore.</font></b></p>
