      <p>Actually, it all began with an episode of Xena.</p>
      <p> Sorry to mix fantasy metaphors in the first two sentences of this little 
        essay, but that's the truth.</p>
      <p> I was at Meow Mix watching their Tuesday night marathon and there was 
        this one episode where Xena has to travel over hill and dale to, um, do 
        something heroic or other. But she's riding over all this really great 
        Australian - I mean Greek - scenery and I thought damn, even if it was 
        just fantasy, nobody goes on great quests anymore. Through foreign lands 
        and haunted woods and the like. I felt a pang of something like nostalgia</p>
      <p> Then I had this dream in which I was a grown up and could finally do 
        whatever I wanted, like riding a horse cross-country in search of adventure. 
        But in this dream I realized even as I picked out my palomino that of 
        course I couldn't; I didn't know the first damn thing about horses or 
        riding or where I could ride a horse since you can't take them on Route 
        80</p>
      <p> Then I woke up and realized that of course I could go cross-country, 
        in the American equivalent of a horse: a car.</p>

      <p> 2.</p>
      <p>Recently, I have had a story accepted for publication by Amazing Stories. 
        This is the science fiction mag where Asimov got his start. They're putting 
        it in issue 600 (next Spring), probably an anniversary issue.</p>
      <p>It was something I had been dreaming about since I was in third grade 
        and discovered Lloyd Alexander (the title of this self-centered editorial 
        is from the book Taran Wanderer from his Prydain series). When I was in 
        5th grade and discovered Podkayne of Mars, my desires were pretty much 
        sealed.</p>
      <p> I have been writing constantly since that time and keeping it to myself. 
        I think most of my friends in the science fiction industry were surprised 
        when I told them the good news. This was only my second submission ever, 
        and the thought of being published was still a hope I sort of kept at 
        bay, something that would happen eventually, not now, not until after 
        many more rejections and a lot more work.</p>
      <p> So suddenly one of my life's goals was accomplished. Out of nowhere. 
        Oh, I know intellectually there is much more to be done, books and stories 
        just screaming out for a good agent and a house that understands f and 
        sf. Hey, maybe there's even a career. But right now I am still in shock 
        and my wheels are spinning. I haven't written a word since</p>
      <p> Add that to the usual late twenties whatthefuckamidoinghere, and my 
        own more personal wait, I was going into Egyptology why the hell am I 
        here producing Star Trek cd-roms, and you have the makings of a great 
        cross country quest, even without something heroic to do at the end.</p>
      <p>(well, some would argue that voluntarily visiting Paramount Licensing 
        is pretty heroic, and for me just getting on the plane to come home is 
        an epic battle) </p>
      <hr>
      <p>3.</p>
      <p>In middle and high school I used to eat dinner and then play videogames 
        for an hour before starting my homework, sometimes two. Great mindless 
        action games, like Oil's Well and Turrican Two I could feel the out-of-alignment 
        cogs in my head slowly slip back into place and spin normally instead 
        of grinding and crashing.</p>
      <p> The thing about going through the midwest is that the land settles down 
        and becomes flat and the spiky things in my head calm down. That cop who 
        gave me the speeding ticket warned me before we took off that the number 
        one cause of accidents on that highway in Utah is that the landscape becomes 
        so infinite and boring in every direction that drivers fall asleep at 
        the wheel. I have to say, it made my mind go pretty blank for the first 
        time in over a year</p>
      <p> A year full of cancellations of my favorite projects, Canadian transsexuals 
        forcing the cancellation of my favorite projects, too much emotional abuse 
        given and received at work, periods of depression punctuated by periods 
        of more depression, and a lot of writing. </p>
      <p>Compared to my good old days, very little video game playing.</p>
      <p> Thank God for Everquest.</p>
      <hr>
      <p> I meant to go last year but somehow didn't work up the energy. I meant 
        to go alone, but wound up taking my sister, which except for the ragging 
        on my music, boyfriend, and driving, has been pretty killer. I didn't 
        mean to stop in Vegas but it was my friend Lexi's birthday.</p>
      <p> I've seen more incredible natural beauty in a week than I thought was 
        possible.</p>
      <p> And what did I get out of it? Calmness, for a week, except for the occasional 
        burst of road rage in a national park.</p>
      <p> A week of wondering what's next.</p>
      <p> And an idea for a story or two. </p>
