<h1><font color="#0000FF"><b>Temple of Solusek Ro Quests:</b></font></h1>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The Harvester</font>:  Vurgo will make you a Harvester.  You must first bring him a shadowed scythe from a
shadow man.  He will then ask you to get a fungus eye from the Mortuary Fungus in
Unrest (Basement Fire Pits) , a shadowed knife from the goblin headmaster in the OOT(Oracle Island Headhunter
PH), and a fire opal(55PP in the Temple).&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Necromancer Shadowbound Armor:</font>  Syllina will make shadowbound armor for necromancers.  She
makes 3 kinds:  boots, gloves and a robe.  In addition, she will tell you how to make shadow silk for
50gp.  This is made through the tailoring skill, so you either have to learn tailoring or have to buy it
from a tailor.  I keep getting conflicting reports on which sceptor she wants for which quest.  I think that
it is set to vary randomly from person to person and she will ask for a different sceptor each time.  Best
bet is to ask her first.  The scepters need to be identified to see which one they are, and they seem to
appear in both Mistmoore and Guk.  I have also been told that you need to give her the items in the
order she lists them, but can't confirm this.&nbsp;<br>
