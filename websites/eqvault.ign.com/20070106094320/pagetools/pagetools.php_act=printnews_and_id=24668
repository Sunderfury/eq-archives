Right now, though, we’re focusing on graphical revamps of the original EverQuest zones."<br>...<br><br>Nolrog:  "just confirmed that the code change we needed to implement the Forage AA for those players that don't have a Forage skill is done. I don't have a timetable for when you'll see a Forage AA but it will be Soon(tm)."<br>....<br><br>Brannoc: "We don’t have any plans to remove flags from older flagged zones. As the game progresses, getting those flags becomes easier but we like people to be able to experience the game flow in the way it was originally built."<br>...<br><br>Merloc: "I've gotten several dozens of pages of feedback on weapons in TSS, and I'll be looking them over for possible upgrades over Christmas."<br><br>There's lots more information of interest in the chat logs, so be sure to check them out.  Thanks devs for taking the time to talk with people and take questions.<br><br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 22 Dec, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24668">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24668</a><br>Printed On: Sat Jan 6 1:43:20 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
