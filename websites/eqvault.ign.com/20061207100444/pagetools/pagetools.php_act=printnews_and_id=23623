Many cultures around the world celebrate similar holidays centered on harvest time.<br><br>The forum challenge for November is to post a recipe and picture from your culture that is used to celebrate harvest time. (It does not necessarily have to be a recipe your family serves)<br><br>The categories for this challenge will be: <br><br>Most unusual recipe<br>Most appealing recipe<br>Recipe most likely to have the most leftovers if served in your house<br><br><br>The Harvest Challenge will start today as of this post and run through Monday, November 27th at noon PST. You may submit your recipe and picture to cdelzer@soe.sony.com. Please include your forum handle and what culture uses this recipe for its harvest celebration as well as the category you wish to submit your recipe in.<br><br>On Monday, November 27th sometimes after noon PST, I will post the recipes on the Just for Fun forum and start a poll for each category so the community can vote on the recipes. One challenge winner from each category will receive a special forum title and an in-game prize for one character of their choice.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 22 Nov, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23623">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23623</a><br>Printed On: Thu Dec 7 2:04:44 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
