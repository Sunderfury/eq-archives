The timeline will show each server's current position in the progression. When this page is accessed, it will scroll sideways to show you the current progress and stops when the current expansion is centered on the page. The timeline will display "nodes" of requirements players have to "unlock" to progress. The number of unlocks for each expansion will be displayed, but not name what the requirement is until after it has been completed. Once completed, an unlock will show the title of the requirement, the time and date, and a link to a list of the people in the raid, group, or single person who completed the requirement. <br><br>Also included with the regular character tracking on EQPlayers, for the Progression servers there will be:<br><br>Progression Server Conquests - A separate page for server "Conquests" so players can see what mobs have been killed already and by whom, linked to those users'character profiles. <br><br>Progression Server Characters - "Conquests" on the pages of players who were the first to kill specific mobs that are or aren't necessarily part of the unlock requirements. <br><br>Make sure you check these all out on Wednesday. You will be able to access the <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/prog_flash.vm?sid=152">timeline</a> by going to the front page of <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/index.vm">EQPlayers</a> and clicking on the banner that will be there on Wednesday afternoon. <br><br>(Similar server and character conquest tracking should be available for all servers in the next few months.) </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 28 June, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18834">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18834</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 18 13:36:04 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
