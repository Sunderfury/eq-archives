This will give you the time in years, but it is rounded so there may be some discrepancies.<br><br>*Veteran rewards are updated once a month, therefore if your account rolls over to another year of rewards in the middle of the month you will not see a change until the next month<br><br>*If you bought a year's subscription your account will be credited for that year. Your entitled time will not increase until that entire year has passed and you sign up for another subscription (be that a 1 month, 3 month, or year plan).<br><br>*No matter how much played time a particular character has, Veteran rewards are based on the account. If you move your character to a different account, your character will reflect the appropriate number of Vet rewards for THAT account...not the previous one.<br><br>*Known dates where Veteran issues arose: 9/13 and 10/31 some people were affected in either of the following ways<br><br>They were able to claim twice on the same character and therefore used one too many of their available /veteran claims <br>Their entitled time was wiped, and should now be restored to the correct amount through the database<br>*Any time that was free or unpaid on the account will not be counted towards the Veteran rewards -- including the first 30 day free trial period and any lapses in billing subscriptions.<br><br>*If you get an error in game (until recently it said please try to /veteran again in a few minutes) that means either a. You are not yet eligible for Veteran rewards, or b. You do not have any claims left to use<br><br>*Caveat - if they used two claims on the same character through a bug they may be entitled to be reimbursed one of those claims.<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 8 November, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12537">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12537</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:03:36 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
