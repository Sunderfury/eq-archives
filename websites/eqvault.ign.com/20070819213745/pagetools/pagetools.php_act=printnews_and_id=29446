Go check it out...<blockquote>I’d like to take a moment to talk about our intent here. If you’re looking for things such as update information, interaction with the community, or a weekly play-by-play of what the dev team is up to, please visit our official forums here. If you’re interested in more general “state of the game” type information, check out my producer letter – you can find the latest one here. This space is going to be a bit different…at times we may delve a little more microcosmic and talk about life as a game developer, and at times talk on a high-in-the-sky level on the industry as a whole or game theory. If this sounds like your mug of ale, please stay tuned!</blockquote><a href="http://blogs.ign.com/EQOA_Team/2007/05/16">Read the Rest...</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 17 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29446">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29446</a><br>Printed On: Sun Aug 19 14:37:45 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
