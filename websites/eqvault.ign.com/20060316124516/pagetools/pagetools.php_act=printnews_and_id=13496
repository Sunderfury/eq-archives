Go have a look.<blockquote>What would a new expansion be without new missions to go on, though? Rest assured, there are quite a few, many of them available in new underground zones. These new missions span a decently wide range of levels, so the new content doesn’t cater to just older players, and can be accessible right away.<br>  <br>  Still, I think Sony knows that the staying power of EverQuest comes from keeping old players hooked, not really recruiting new players. Some of the higher level missions are very difficult, not only to play, but to even get to, as I was told from some of the old hands. Some of these missions may be a bit too difficult, and tiresome and frustrating at times. Still, if you like a challenge, that’s something EverQuest continues to deliver.</blockquote><a href="http://www.gamechronicles.com/reviews/pc/eqdepths/darkhollow.htm">Read the Rest...</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 16 December, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13496">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13496</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:45:16 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
