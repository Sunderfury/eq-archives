Tonight’s chat is open, so all questions are welcome. <br>Preston - Please send your questions to [QT]Fylraen by using /msg [QT]Fylraen My question here. Questions sent to the developers will NOT be answered so please do not send them to the devs. You only need to send your question one time. Sending it multiple times will not increase the likelihood of it being answered. <br>Preston - We'll begin with a brief introduction from our guests and then proceed with the chat. Now would be a good time to send those questions to [QT]Fylraen! <br>Merloc - Hello, I'm Keith Turkowski (Merloc), Game Designer responsible for items. <br>Ngreth - Hello. I am Adam "Ngreth" Bell, game designer for Everquest, specializing in tradeskills. <br>Prathun - Greetings everyone! I'm Jonathan Caraker, the designer in charge of spells for EverQuest. <br>Zajeer-Dev - Hi there, I'm Zajeer, a designer on EverQuest <br>Rashere - Good evening everyone and welcome to the chat. I'm Travis McGeathy, Lead Designer for EverQuest. <br>Zatozia - Greetings! I’m Lydia Pope, Zatozia the Torturess. And I suppose I should start off by saying, I’m the new Community Manager for EverQuest. Kytherea has moved on to be SOE’s International Community Manager. She’ll be saying goodbye and I’ll be saying hello on the website in the next couple of days. <br>Vahlar - Hi, my name is Holly Longdale, assistant lead on EverQuest! <br><br>Preston - *Chanaluss* The shadowknights have come to realize that our primary DD line possesses recast timers 50% longer than other hybrid classes. Also noted, other hybrid classes can mem multiple level 65+ DD spells, whereas SKs cannot,due to spell linking. are there any plans to change the shadowknight spells to be more in line with their other hybrid counterparts? <br>Prathun - I'll have to look into the reasons why the shadowknight's DD spells have limitations that other comparable classes do not and see if those are appropriate and intended, or relics of an old way of thinking and no longer necessary. Thank you for pointing that out. =) <br><br>Preston - *Croix_FV* Are there any plans to address the lack of AC for Guild Banners, or the general low AC in TBS (Example: Katta Progression Ring) <br>Merloc - We don't have any plans to add AC to Guild Banners for now... I am not sure what is meant by 'general low AC in TBS', several of the items in TBS are higher AC than any other item for that slot... The Katta Progression Ring was addressed, and the 25 AC was considered appropriate. <br><br>Preston - *Tharkis* for serpent seeker's charm there are 2ii drops which are near impossible to get for someone who wants to finish it. Due to the way raids are set up, guilds capable of FC2 and NAG will not go back to kill udengar and almost always skip ambersnout. Can there please be an added method to obtain the Diary and Ambersnout's snout. E.G. in my guild there are 15+ people who have both lethar's heart and beltron drop, yet noo <br>Vahlar - The Serpent Seeker's charm and, in particular, the recent changes reflect the difficulty of getting the item to its full power. The difficulty of the quest and the reward is balanced in such a way that you're rewarded for the content you are capable of doing. I have heard that Ambersnout's difficulty might need a second look, but overall, we're happy how the item develops as it stands. We'll keep an eye on it, however. <br><br>Preston - *Croix_FV* Guilds are already gaining access to Solteris. Does this mean TBS raid content will be completed quickly or is there more that is unknown to keep high end raiding guilds busy? <br>Zajeer-Dev - While guilds definitely have been getting access to Solteris, I have a good feeling they won’t be finding the events easy to do. The first event in the zone, for example, is supposed to be harder (and is harder) than the final bosses in TSS. And the difficulty only ramps up from there. I’ll give the next guild a cookie if they can beat the 6th raid in the zone in the next 3 months :) <br><br>Preston - *Kela-the-Gypsy* Spells question - The wizard spell Beam of Solteris can kill the casting wizard in its current state. Is it intentional to allow the proc to go off as many times as mobs that this AE spell lands on? <br>Prathun - The recourse is only supposed to fire once, so the side effect of killing the caster against multiple mobs was unintended. I'd like to rework the spell so that's not a possibility. <br>Prathun - On average you have to hit 5 NPCs for every 900 damage returned, so you have to hit a *LOT* of NPCs at once to kill yourself, so in the meantime be careful about how and where you use the spell. <br>Zajeer-Dev - Or die, that's cool too <br>Prathun - Also, I just have to say that the MSPaint rendition of your death in the Warrens was hilarious. =) <br><br>Preston - *Chanaluss* Are the stories of Venril, Lanys, Firiona,and Morden going to continue in the near future? <br>Vahlar - The storylines we've been developing over the past few years are definitely not over and will be addressed as we go on. I'm mostly the gatekeeper for that lore and I do present storylines to the team when we discuss future content. <br>Vahlar - Rashere is also well aware of them and we determine which we want to address, even if they are storylines from many years ago, like the Combine, Shissar, and so on. So, I can say with a reasonable amount of confidence that you will see these storylines addressed. When, I cannot say. <br><br>Preston - *Zigee-TR* our guildmate Tharkis wants to know when will barbarian models be able to wear SKIRTS or at the very least Robe models. <br>Rashere - We call them kilts and barbarians already have em! ;) Seriously, though, there are no plans for the current barbarian model to be able to show robes but there’s the potential to do so when we redo the model. <br><br>Preston - *Lifnuker* when will the new magician pet models be put in? <br>Rashere - We don’t have any timeline for when we’ll be introducing new PC pet models yet. raid and group) in the game (dating back to 1999), but with TSS and TBS, we've seen HTH weapons introduced at lower ratios compared to generic melee weapons. This seems like an oversight, and doesn't make any sense, is this something that can be looked into? <br>Zatozia - By the way, Tharkis wants you to know that it's a Kilt! <br>Rashere - but he would look great in a dress... <br>Prathun - Tharkis will always be a Pretty Kitty Princess, to me. <br>Zajeer-Dev - Gag <br>Merloc - I'll look into it, I'm not adverse to increasing the TBS monk weapons in relation to other types of weapons, but I have to consider other DPS factors first, like monk innate abilities. <br><br>Preston - *TenaniTempest* what was the reason some tss spells were not vendor bought and were drop only (thinking of mage spells in particular) <br>Prathun - Because of the way those mage spells work (they summon items), there was only one version created, and these items were tuned strong enough that we wanted them to be world drops, effectively rank II spells, and not vendor purchasable. <br>Prathun - I know those are difficult to acquire, mostly because everyone wants a copy of the spells, and there is no Rank I version to fall back on. <br>Prathun - If it continues to be a problem we can look into increasing the availability or perhaps creating a weaker version of the spell for vendor purchase. <br><br>Preston - *Jyve* Although it's not the intent of some missions to be beaten the way they are, some take skill todo so, is it possible we'll continue to see more unusual missions that allow unconventional solutions, albeit with a different reward? <br>Rashere - I love when players find non-traditional ways to complete content as long as it’s not crossing the boundaries of balance so would be happy to see more of that in the future. Most of the time, we don’t specifically build out these alternate ways but rather the open game play of EQ just allows them, so building the missions to give alternate rewards in these cases isn’t likely. <br><br>Preston - *Reorx* How many changes are there expected to be to the TBS vendor items? Minor tweaking or significant changes in the near future? <br>Merloc - I'm planning to add a few more items to the vendors, and I'm sure I'll be doing minor tweaks to the current items. I'd also like to spend some time on power sources to increase the diversity of effects. <br><br>Preston - *Nattican* Hello. My question is in regards to the TSS shaman raid class item. It's now 7 months later, and there's still no word on it. With the lack of TSS item upgrades in general, can we expect to see this going in soon? Can we know what slot it will be? <br>Zajeer-Dev - Yes, this will be going in very soon. We'll try and update Frostcrypt with the item this week. It's a shoulderpiece <br><br>Preston - *Hilyen* When will the Combine and Sleeper servers be merged? The raiding population has become so small that it has become impossible to progress further. <br>Rashere - We’re working out the details on the merge. There’s no ETA yet, but we plan to do it in the near future. <br><br>Preston - *Waring* what is the plan for the august fan faire <br>Zatozia - we'll have more information about the next Fan Faire as soon as we can. We're just finalizing some details before making it official <br><br>Preston - *Azazel* Are there any plans to update LDoN quests and adventures to make them useful to level 70 and above characters? or to upgrade the vendors to make the gear more useful to players about 65? <br>Rashere - We don’t have any plans to update LDoN at this time. At this point its simply older content and just like other old content, while it servers a purpose for some players, the newer stuff holds better rewards. <br><br>Preston - *Lotus* for Merloc When will we be seeing focus effects on TSS class items, if ever? <br>Merloc - That's at the top of my list after TSS / TBS weapon tuning, hopefully in the next week. <br><br>Preston - *Silentwolfe* My question : First, I want to say hello and my hats off to the EQ team. Second, I was wondering what we can look forward to with this year's anniversary events? <br>Rashere - The team is hard at work introducing Fabled NPCs to Luclin right now. They'll be joined by all the Fabled from the past as well as additional events that will play out throughout our anniversary. <br><br>Preston - *LoKiDeCaT* Is there a timer when we can expect the Sebilis Key quest to be fixed? As a hotzone, many of us are eager to play there, but cannot. <br>Rashere - I've been working on this exact problem today and think I have a solution now. Once this chat is done, I'll be verifying it and getting the fix into QA. For reference, this only seems to affect people who are trying to get into the zone using only the idol and don't have it on their key ring yet. <br>Rashere - So, it should be fixed on live servers very soon, although it will require a full patch to get it out there. <br><br>Preston - *Sinthala* Might there be some work in progress to unlink monk 30 second dmg discs and lull timers? <br>Prathun - We've been discussing this recently but we haven't come to a decision yet on whether we want to change that or how it should be changed. <br><br>Preston - *COLD26* I have noticed that my ranger seems to do less bow dmg when a mob is rooted was that intended or just coincidence <br>Rashere - This is intentional and dates back to the early days of EQ. I believe the reasoning was due to the low risk involved with archery and rooted mobs since archery doesn’t break root like a spell does. <br>Rashere - It’s something we could look into changing, although we’d likely need to make archery have a chance to break root just like spell casting does if we did. <br><br>Preston - *Ronda* When will the dougs in the Fridleif event be fixed? <br>Zajeer-Dev - I'll check into this and have a fix out before the end of the week. I didn't know there were still dougs in the event :/ <br>Zajeer-Dev - And I'm being told it's Wulfnor, not Fridleif <br>Zajeer-Dev - So I'll check into that too! <br><br>Preston - *Sinthala* any plans to increase the range on current throwing items to a further range than 250? <br>Merloc - No, due to issues with aggro radius, we probably won't be increasing range beyond 250 any time soon. <br><br>Preston - *TenaniTempest* will they even unnerf monk mez? <br>Prathun - Though the monk Echo of Misdirection ability uses the mesmerization effect, it was never intended to be used as in-camp crowd control. I will actively discourage its use for that purpose as it infringes on the role of Enchanters. <br>Prathun - A few people have suggested changing the requirement on the spell to "only works when the target is non-aggro" which is a good idea but not something we can currently do. <br>Prathun - For now, I'm happy with how the ability works. <br><br>Preston - *Guest19* will the necklace of warportal fragments ever be set to where it does not port you in to a bunch of mobs where have to train zone ? <br>Zajeer-Dev - It sounds like either the portal spell location needs to change, or the NPCs need to be thinned out a little at that location. I'll look into it and see if I can make it a little less tedious <br><br>Preston - *EMarr_Forcogar* I've seen the topic before on the forums. Will there be any way to customize a guild hall in the future, with say something like template zones that the guild leader can set as the "guilds theme" in addition to displaying a guild banner/tapestry in the guild hall? <br>Rashere - It comes up a lot and I think it’d be very cool to let people basically choose from a variety of looks to their guild halls. No plans at the moment to do so, but it’d be great to see that in the future. In the near term, though, we’d like to set up a big banner in the guild hall that will take the symbols and colors you set for your guild banner so you can have your guild emblem on display. <br><br>Preston - *Dosvelas_AB* Is Demi-plane focus "Chromatic Arc V" going to bu upgraded to affect spells up to level 72 like any othet DP+ focus i recall? And is the limitation to instant spells only going to be removed, in the line of every other damage focus that affect 1 resist only? <br>Prathun - I've changed Chromatic Arc V to decay at level 72. Thanks for pointing that out. <br><br>Preston - That's it for this one folks! Thanks for joining us here on Stratics IRC, the logs will be up on http://www.stratics.com shortly. Be sure to come by next time! <br>Merloc - Thanks for the comments and questions, see you next time. <br>Ngreth - Thanks for attending! Have a great evening and go teach some pirates their manners! <br>Vahlar - Thanks for coming and have a great night! <br>Zatozia - Thank you for joining us everyone! I’m going to be hanging out in the #everquest chat area for a few moments after the chat if anyone wants to yap. 8) <br>Zajeer-Dev - Thanks for the fish and goodnight! <br>Rashere - Thanks for coming folks. Be sure to tip Tharkis on your way out. <br>Prathun - G'night and watch out for Kela if she has a train of kobolds behind her! </span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 22 Feb, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26810">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26810</a><br>Printed On: Tue Feb 27 21:19:12 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
