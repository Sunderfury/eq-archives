Similarly, the digital version of the CSG allows players to build and customize fleets, explore islands for treasure and attack fellow online buccaneers for their booty.  Players can also communicate in real time with opponents and allies to trade treasure and ships to round out their collections.  <br><br>“Bringing the immensely popular Pirates CSG to 3D online play is the next step in collectible gaming,” said Scott Martins, director of development, SOE-Denver. “We’ve taken the fun of high seas treasure hunting and ship-to-ship combat and made it accessible to a worldwide audience in a shared experience.” <br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 15 Dec, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24420">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24420</a><br>Printed On: Sat Jan 6 1:42:07 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
