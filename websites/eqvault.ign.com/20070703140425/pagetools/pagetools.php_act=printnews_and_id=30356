I call it the "elephant in the room" because even though the problem is pretty obvious to the players, the developers are not posting any comments or explanations on any threads concerning the crashes, even the recently <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?start=15&topic_id=113367">stickied one.</a><br><br>The rumor mill has it that the crashes are related to guilds being in the Solteris instanced zone, with evidence given that when a guild entered Solteris on Firiona Vie, the problems started, and that Drinal is stable because no guilds are in Solteris at the moment.  Since this has not been confirmed, at the moment it's only player guessing.<br><br>Why the developers have not come out publicly with any comments is a big unknown.  Perhaps they just have nothing to say on the matter.  The problem is most acute on FV server, because the whole game doesn't crash, just the individual zones one by one, according to player accounts.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 18 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30356">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30356</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jul 3 7:04:25 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
