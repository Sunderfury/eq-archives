What will his role be in the world order?  Is he the avatar of Veeshan, or just waiting for his moment to unite the dragons for world domination?<br><br>There are clues all over Norrath concerning the lore of the world -- in libraries, in talking to NPCs, and in signs and symbols in the artwork and architecture.  The development team spends a significant amount of time fleshing out the world of Norrath and there is backstory everywhere for players to discover, and the return of Kerafyrm ties in many old threads of story.  You certainly can play the game without knowing much about what's going on, but you might be surprised how much backstory and detail there is.
