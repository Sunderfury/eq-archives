Kytherea from SOE responded on February 27:<br><br>"Unfortunately we were expecting some guild banks may not have been restored properly, as mentioned in the update message on February 24th.  CS is supposed to be assisting if a guild bank is reported to them as still empty after this last update.<br><br> Please petition again."<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 28 February, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15344">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15344</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 2:57:52 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
