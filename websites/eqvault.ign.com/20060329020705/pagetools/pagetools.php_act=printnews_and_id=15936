They either did not allow players in, or crashed during play.  I am told that they are working today, but that you may have to be persistent in hailing the starting NPC to start the instances.  <br><br>Double experience continues through Wednesday morning.  Good luck!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 20 March, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15936">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15936</a><br>Printed On: Tue Mar 28 18:07:05 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
