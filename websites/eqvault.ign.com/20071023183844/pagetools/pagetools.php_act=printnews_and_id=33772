Rashere <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=120323">says "yes"</a> in the EQPlayers forums:<br><br>"There will be.  If it hasn't been announced yet, it will be soon.  All I'll say for now is that I saw the near-final art for the item yesterday and its one of the coolest devices I've seen in EQ."<br><br>Woot!<br><br>And it's not the warg mount, according to Rashere:  "The worg mount is the in-box (and equivalent for digital versions) reward, not the pre-order item."<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 5 Oct, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=33772">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=33772</a><br>Printed On: Tue Oct 23 11:38:44 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
