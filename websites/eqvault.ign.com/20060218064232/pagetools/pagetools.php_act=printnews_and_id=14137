The modern draft horse, such as the percheron, is descended from the ancient "warhorse."  A knights horse was bred to be big boned, able to carry large amounts of weight, and to withstand attacks from foot soldiers as well as other jousting knights.  They were never swift.  It was not until the development of the light horse calvary that the lighter breeds were used to create a swift, sensitive horse that could gallop quickly.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 13 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14137">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14137</a><br>Printed On: Fri Feb 17 22:42:32 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
