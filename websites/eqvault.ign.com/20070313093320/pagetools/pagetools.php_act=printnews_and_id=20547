The Vault Network is offering these logos to any site that wishes to display them.  <br><br>As editor of EQVault, I am strongly against buying and selling in-game items and money for real life cash.  We do not accept advertising from IGE or any other plat sellers.<br><br>I am proud that our site now states exactly where we stand on this issue.  Thanks Vault Network!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 24 Aug, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20547">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20547</a><br>Printed On: Tue Mar 13 2:33:20 PDT 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
