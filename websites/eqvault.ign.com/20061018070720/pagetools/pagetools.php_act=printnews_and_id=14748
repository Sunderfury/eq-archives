Most of the zones are for levels 60-70 and the expansion contains a number of difficult raid zones for well-geared guilds.  There is single group content, however, and some of the features such as a revamping of the old world zones, new quests, extra bank slots and buff blockers as well as new skills such as traps and spheres of influence make it appealing for all levels.<br><br>I will publish screen shots later this week!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 7 February, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14748">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14748</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:07:22 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
