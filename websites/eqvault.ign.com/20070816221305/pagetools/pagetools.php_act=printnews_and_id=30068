It has a steep curve and while they have made efforts to correct this, the new player experience is not really their current focus. Specifically, he characterized the churn of players out of the game as extremely low, a major reason for them to focus on keeping those long lasting subscribers happy."<br><br>So expect more from the end game, and not as much newbie stuff, if these comments accurately reflect the focus of the producer.  It's perhaps a shame they have given up on attracting new players, but not surprising.  EQ has a niche, and it epitomizes the hard core, raiding game MMO genre.  That's what it's best at, and why not do what you do best?  People who grow bored with easier MMOs will hear about EQ through word of mouth, and perhaps Station Access, and give it a try.  It's been painfully obvious that they are not putting any emphasis on marketing campaigns in print or in stores, with the shift to digital download and no presence in gaming or big box stores for their product.<br><br>Worley states that they have 40 developers working on the game, which is about the same as the other titles they publish (EQII, Vanguard) which indicates they are supporting EverQuest, and it's not "dying" as so many people would like to believe.<br><br>Concerning the newest expansion, Secrets of Faydwer, which will go live November 15:<br><br>"...live events have become increasingly important for the developers. These events build up to and introduce new expansions and are totally free to the player. He doesn't believe these should just be throw onto the pile. Instead, he wants to introduce them to the players, give them a taste of what it offers, and then ask them to plunk down their money and make a purchase.<br><br>This expansion offers players mid to high level raid content and employs a clockwork theme. Players should expect lots of gears and gadgets in their enemies this time around. They even have a raid inside a giant Zeppelin and a robot that players can not just enter, but quest inside.<br><br>To introduce it, they plan an epic live event. Worely kept his secrets as best he could, but he did reveal that they would literally move a mountain to set things up. As it flies in the air above, mechanical creatures will rain down on the players. There is more, but what he told us was just enough to illustrate his philosophy of showing players what they can expect in an expansion pack through live events."<br><br>By introducing the expansion in the live game with an epic event, Worley can achieve both the team's marketing goals and bring in some of the later expansion adopters earlier.  In every expansion, it seems that people wait to buy; this strategy may generate more sales for the expansion earlier and involve players in a more active way.   In the early days of EQ, such as the opening of Plane of Hate, the entire world was involved in the live event that made for lasting memories (some better than others, it was quite a newbie slaughter).  Bringing back that kind of GM and development team involvement in the launch of an expansion should have a positive effect for the game.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 8 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30068">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30068</a><br>Printed On: Thu Aug 16 15:13:06 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
