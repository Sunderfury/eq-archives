The ultimate goal is to make sure that the players that are being affected by the merge have the best user experience as possible. So when it comes to similar names and player email there were a few hiccups that I wanted to have addressed that were more important than “hitting the date” of the merge.<br><br>I am planning on having a new timeline this week to review. I am sure that everything will be addressed and I will be able to share it with everyone.<br><br>Until then… have fun and watch for an update later this week.</blockquote><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 5 Feb, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=49795">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=49795</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 4 23:47:40 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
