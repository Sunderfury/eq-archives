Makes you feel a tad bit humble when you made the amateur movie.<br><br>The SOE movie is great, so enjoy.<br><br>My movie was still fun to make!  Plus, it has a fun song to go with it.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 7 Feb, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26322">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26322</a><br>Printed On: Tue Feb 27 21:24:50 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
