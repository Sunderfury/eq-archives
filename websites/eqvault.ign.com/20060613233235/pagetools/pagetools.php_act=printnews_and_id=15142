For those veterans who remember binding and buffing at the Freeport gates, running through the tunnels, and fighting the corrupt militia, today is the day to go back and say goodbye one last time!<br><br>Auld Lang Syne/Times Long Gone (Scottish song by Robert Burns)<br><br>Should old acquaintances be forgotten,<br>And never brought to mind?<br>Should old acquaintances be forgotten,<br>And days of long ago !<br><br>Chorus:<br>For old long ago, my dear<br>For old long ago,<br>We will take a cup of kindness yet<br>For old long ago. <br><br>We two have run about the hillsides<br>And pulled the daisies fine,<br>But we have wandered many a weary foot<br>For old long ago.<br><br>We two have paddled (waded) in the stream<br>From noon until dinner time,<br>But seas between us broad have roared<br>Since old long ago.<br><br>And there is a hand, my trusty friend,<br>And give us a hand of yours,<br>And we will take a goodwill draught (of ale)<br>For old long ago!<br><br>And surely you will pay for your pint,<br>And surely I will pay for mine!<br>And we will take a cup of kindness yet<br>For old long ago!<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 20 February, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15142">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15142</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 13 16:32:35 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
