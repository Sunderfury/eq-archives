They will be LORE to each other, meaning you will only be able to possess either epic 1.5 OR epic 2.0.  Prior to the update it is advised that if you still possess both epic 1.5 and 2.0 that you delete 1.5, the code for this change will remove one of these from your possession but will not differentiate between the two.  If the system does the deletion, there is a possibility your epic 2.0 will be removed from your possession instead of the 1.5.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 29 August, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10530">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10530</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:37:08 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
