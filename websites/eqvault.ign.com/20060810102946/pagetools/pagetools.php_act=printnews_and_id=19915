Drop by to give it a read.<blockquote><i><b>Jonric: </b>Will there be many new items such as weapons, armor, etc? What are some interesting ones players can expect to see?<br>  </i><br>  <b>David Ford:</b> Visually speaking, there are a number of really great looking held items that will be found in The Serpent's Spine. One I really like is a Lava dagger that has flowing magma that runs through the blade itself.<br>  <br>  We will be itemizing the expansion from level 1 onward, so there really won't be any type of item that exists in EverQuest that you can't find somewhere in this expansion. Not to say that every item will be duplicated, but the variety will be quite large.</blockquote><a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/722/722688p1.html">Read the Rest...</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 2 August, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19915">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19915</a><br>Printed On: Thu Aug 10 3:29:46 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
