I think we stumbled out of bed sometime around the crack of dawn (9am or so – see the prior article as to what happened last night).  This time the brunch was centered on EverQuest Live, and as before I found it very well attended and bearing no resemblance to “brunch” – although the breakfast portion was certainly adequate in the beginning.  The hotel staff found new ways to drive us nuts – after around 10:30 there were no more plates larger than a 3” saucer – and while there was a nice selection of food – the Marriot seemed to run out of potatoes.  But this was only a harbinger of the food hell to come.  Conversation flowed, as did predictions for the banquet, costume contest, live quest and more.<br><br>After lunch Kwill and I formed a group with Tico (two paladins and a cleric – not a lot of DPS, but you would have to actually try to get killed) and hung out in the Legends Lounge in the main room, checking out the vendors, other SOE game exhibits, and the “Make Your Own Comic” software.   I strongly discouraged Kwill from purchasing the pink "Discover my Talent" tank top at the Phat Lewt Store, so she settled for a coffee mug.  Phew.  (I did later observe that same t-shirt on a senior guide at the Saturday night Banquet, however, but her talent was guiding I assume.)<br><br>We couldn’t resist the urge to log in to EQ, and Tico managed to farm Qvic on my laptop, proving once again that EQ players will play anywhere, any time.  And EQ players know their game, too – random wandering attendees would look over his shoulder and comment, “farming Qvic, eh?”<br><br>After some arm twisting from the EQ2 devs about how I should try EQ2, I decided to put EQ2 on my laptop.  I was having a small technical problem getting it up and running on my laptop, but not to worry -- it just happened that sharing my table after lunch in the EverQuest Legends Lounge was no less than an EQ2 Developer (coder).  Taking time out from his own stuff, he proceeded to guide me through the steps to completion.  I have to thank him and his most patient wife who sat through the entire thing.<br><br>At this point the live quest started, and after wandering around a bit hailing the NPC’s just for fun (1 – you should go to a Fan Faire, 2 – you’ve gotta talk with the most amazing female dwarf named Brass.  I’m not much of a roleplayer – but Brass rocks.)  After a brief chat with Brass regarding today’s female dwarves’ regrettable penchant for shaving their beards, it brought to mind a problem my guild mate Neijitsu, herself a lady dwarf, experienced:  the bard in her group refused to let her in until she shaved her beard.   Needless to say Neijitsu didn’t take this quietly.  But perhaps that’s a story for as they say, ‘another time’.<br><br>Now, ya’ll must be thinking that surely if Pakse so much as entered the Live Quest he’d have to win with his superior brain.  I however, taking pity on the little people this year declined to participate, electing instead to sit back and enjoy the festivities (truth be told, I have never yet, in four Fan Faires, actually completed the entire quest in the time allotted – and I’ve had a few good groups.  The puzzles are tough.).  However, when Sananmair (the Paladin representative to the Community Summit recently from Glasglow, England) wandered by table with a look of concern I was quite happy to be able to give him a moment of assistance by using my browser to google something for the quest.  Yes, you do need to call a friend for some of the questions!  Kytherea later confirmed that the trivia question was pretty hard.<br><br>On to the panels!  Great panels, where the diversity of the players matched that which I have come to expect in the game.  Gentlemen from their 70’s to a boy the age of 9 stood and asked questions (the 9 year old plays a 70 Wizard, in a raid guild currently in Tacvi and Anguish, the 74 year old plays a 68 Rogue in a family raid guild currently in Time). There are a lot of gals at fan faire – my guess would be 40-45% of the attendees are women.  Not all play, and some who do play, play very casually – but ladies are certainly present.  We met entire families who played, in many cases multi-generational.<br><br>The panels covered everything from Class Balance to the Future Direction of EQ.  If the community summits are SOE’s way to reach out and listen to the community via a small focus group – Fan Faire via the forums is a huge extension thereof.   <br><br>Necros were thankfully silent during the class balance feature =)  I dare say the likes of Paladins, rangers, wizards, mages and others would have taken great offense at their complaint.  Paladins expressed concerns over Stun, and the dev’s agreed it was not working as intended and would be looked into.  Shadow Knights are also get a quick review in regard to their damage, there was concern that while Paladins have an avenue to upgrade LoH, SK’s need a similar upgrade path for Harm Touch.  Druids had very strong words about healing (or lack thereof) – the answer I heard was, “You have more overall utility than a cleric with DoT’s, Buffs, and Transportation – therefore we’re not going to make you the equivalent in healing of a cleric.”  While perhaps accurate, was not taken kindly by the young lady druid who posed the question.  I swear the nice enchanter lady who asked about increasing their utility was nearly in tears when at the banquet later that evening someone quipped in jest, “SOE believes Enchanters to be a rewarding, enriching and enjoyably class to play.” All joking aside, Enchanters need a bit of help today and I think the devs now understand the concerns.  Clerics were complaining, rightly so that their utility consisted of, “1…2…3…CH…1…2…3…CH” repeated ad nauseum during raids.  Much to their disappointment, the answer was clear, “Clerics have higher utility than any other class – if you want to be invited into almost every single group and raid – put up with it”.  Clerics weren’t real happy and there was some talk of a boycott – which made the druids happy.  Less clerics in groups = more druids in groups.  So while the two classes momentarily patched things up, I hope and pray it doesn’t last.<br><br>And now the Banquet – have ya heard me complain before the food here?  Gotta get one thing outta the way – the banquet rocked.  That being said, indulge me if you will to present my cred.  I’m a big guy – and I eat a lot.  My shelves are filled with cookbooks.  I cook a great deal now and previously worked as a chef professionally (fine dining).  Couple that with the fact that over the past four years I’ve traveled in excess of 1,000,000 miles and eaten 1000’s upon 1000’s of meals in hotels, including a ton of banquets.<br><br>Now – given the above – understand me that when I say, “The food service at the Mariott Marquis was a poor excuse for caloric nourishment.” Or – to put it another way, the food sucked.  Every other Fan Faire I have been to, the food has been awesome.  So you can imagine my disappointment when I sat down on Saturday.  Where to start?  Well, we’re in Georgia, the “pecan pie” just wasn’t.  Period.  The peaches weren’t ripe.  We’re in Georgia – and they serve us UNRIPE PEACHES.  Isn’t there a law against this down there or something?  The coleslaw was peppered cabbage – no sweet here, just excessive pepper.  The BBQ chicken was fine I guess – except the sauce was a tomato conchise bearing no resemblance to BBQ. BBQ is a SLOW SMOKING cooking method – this chicken had been baked off at too high a temperature far too quickly, a lovely method which produced a product with the favor and texture of sawdust.  We’re not going to talk about small strings of pork swimming in fat passed off ‘pulled pork’ – pulled out of a sewer maybe.  The ‘service’ part was hilarious – they literally were taking plates from people while they were eating off of them.  But no coffee, no service, no nothing (all but 2 were hiding in the kitchen) (remember – they had 1500++ people at this thing.).<br><br>/rant off <br><br>So the food wasn’t so great, but the Saturday night event was awesome.  There were no server tables on Saturday, but guild tables were everywhere. Many guilds had custom tshirts as well. A great DJ was spinning tunes; Brenlo was in fine form on his birthday – and kept the crowd going with games and great prizes.  The Marilyn Monroe-style happy birthday song contest got the crowd going (and Brenlo too, I think!) Live quest winners took home some nice prizes (turns out – the Paladin representative was on a winning team – Grats guy!).  The costume contest as always was cool, lots of pictures being posted up here on EQVault about it.  Brass came in second – in a huge upset by the amazing and professionally ugly troll.  The troll was all-that, from the details to the appearance – she won cleanly (although Brass was certainly very, very close).  Topic of discussion: was that her real stomach?  I don’t know.  In closing, the DJ keep the crowd going for an hour or two until the banquet broke up.  The majority of SOE folks and hard-core fans moved over to the Champions Sports bar where we first gathered Wednesday night – we closed the bar down talking EQ, classes, characters, game theory and everything in between.  It was a great night and a great fan faire.<br><br>Until next year – be safe out there and hope see ya’ll live and in person at the next one.  -- Pakse, 70 Paladin of Cazic Thule</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 10 April, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16540">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16540</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 19 3:54:15 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
