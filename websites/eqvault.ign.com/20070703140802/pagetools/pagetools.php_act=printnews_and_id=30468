There was an odd bit of flip flopping in who did this zone.  It started with me, then I ran out of time so it went to Zajeer, who ran out of time, then back to me after I had freed up some time.  During the time Zajeer had it he made a good map that I hope is included."<br><br>Absor added that he will make sure the New Commonlands map will also be included in the patch. </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 21 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30468">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30468</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jul 3 7:08:02 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
