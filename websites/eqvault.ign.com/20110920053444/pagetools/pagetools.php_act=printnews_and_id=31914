How are you doing that? It seems like in that kind of situation, you really have to play to the fans a lot, because you've got a really dedicated fanbase at that point.<br><br>NB: Yeah. But at that point -- like with EverQuest, which has been going on for over eight years -- we do have all these ways of reaching out to them. We find out the things they like the most and the things they like the least, then we do more of the stuff that they like. <br><br>We talk to them, and that's the key. You've got this audience that's hooked, and they love what you do, and we love our consumers. You have to listen to what they want, but you have to filter it. <br><br>Like one of the guys on the panels said, "You can't do everything that everyone says," because sometimes it's not a good idea, or it's not worth the effort. You absolutely have to listen to them, though, and if they go, "This guy's listening to me, and they're actually doing [something I suggested]. That's cool!" that's what keeps them in. <br><br>Some of our older games -- like Cosmic Rift, Infantry, and Tanarus -- had a really big community that dwindled over time, so what we did with those is we made them free. We just did that this month. We've got the games, and rather than just pull the plug and disappoint the fanbase, [we just say] "Play. Have at it. Enjoy."<br><br>Plus that way, you're keeping numbers high on that sort of thing as well.<br><br>NB: Whenever you talk about the numbers of any given game, it's for that game, so a person playing Tanarus doesn't count towards EverQuest II. You have to be fundamentally honest about that sort of stuff. What it does is that it keeps people playing our game, and for the older games, it shows that people have been loyal to us for a long amount of time.<br><br>With EverQuest being one of the first deeper, more popular MMO experiences aside from Ultima Online, it was difficult to transition people over to EverQuest II. I think that's part of why the original EverQuest is still so strong. How do you address that sort of issue? How do you get those people? One solution is to just keep it going, but eventually, you're going to have to transition them to something else, right?<br><br>NB: Why? When people are loyal, and you've got a good business, there's no reason. Keep them happy. Keep them coming back. There's no reason to try and force them to leave. You've got a good relationship, so why would you want to dump them and go on to something else? Maintain the relationship.<br><br>How much can you change the graphical interface and things like that with a game of that age? How much can you do of that without alienating people?<br><br>NB: You can actually do a lot. If you look at the original EverQuest over its span, it's had some pretty significant engine revamps. Some of the things that we've been doing, particularly over the last two years, are going through the older zones and redoing all the art in those zones, to modernize them to the changes that we've done to the engine. <br><br>The real balance that you fight there -- when it comes to alienation -- is that you're not creating changes such that you're not completely outmoding the lower system specs. You have to make it better without cutting off the bottom tier of technology. That's how you'll lose people, if you make change for change's sake and don't take into account the technical limitation of some of your players.<br><br>Do you find that the bottom tier of technology is becoming less important now? Most people who buy new computers can certainly play EverQuest at this point. Do you find that you're having less problems with that these days, or are there a lot of people who are still on the older stuff?<br><br>NB: The majority of people are on the older stuff. Whenever you're making a game and are proud of it, you want as many people as possible to play that game. In the PC world, the lower the machine spec you can get, the bigger potential audience you have, and the more chance you have for people to look at your work.<br><br>How many subscribers does the original EverQuest have now?<br><br>NB: We don't disclose those numbers.<br><br>I was mostly thinking about how surprising it was to me that anything could maintain someone for quite that long, or at least a group of people who keep coming back and subscribing.<br><br>NB: It's a tremendously healthy game. We're coming out with our next expansion in November. We have our next [just-held] fan fair in August in Las Vegas, to meet with the people who play that game. It's going strong, and showing no signs of going away.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 10 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31914">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31914</a><br>Printed On: Mon Sep 19 22:34:44 PDT 2011<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
