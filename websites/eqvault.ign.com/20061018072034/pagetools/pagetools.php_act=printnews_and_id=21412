Would it be possible to modify the "raid mob" code to not include mobs that are essentially trivial?  Maybe put in a level check for > 10 level difference?<br><br>Developer Nodyin replied: "The con message is intended to indicate the challenge level for those players for whom the content is tuned. That means that if an NPC is a raid NPC for level 50 players but can be soloed by a level 75 it will still be considered a Raid npc and give a 5 minute cooldown. Basepop in a raid zone such as PoHate, Deathknell or Ashengate will also give the 5 minute timer.<br><br>Part of the reasoning for this is that sometimes you'll be suprised when you attack a blue con npc and find it's much harder than the con color would indiate. Now with the new con message you'll understand why that blue con is so challenging - it's an event mob not a normal blue con."<br><br> <br> <br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 23 September, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21412">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21412</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:20:36 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
