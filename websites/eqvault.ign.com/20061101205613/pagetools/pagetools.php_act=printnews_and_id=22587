What is going to happen is that anyone who participated in the exploit will be 'selectively corrected' and will be losing ALL AA points they earned on the day(s) they participated in the exploit.  'Selectively corrected' meaning this will not affect those who did not participate in the exploit.<br><br>If for instance someone participated in the exploit on Monday and gained 500 AA points, skipped doing so on Tuesday and just leveled AA normally receiving 10 AA points, then exploited again on Wednesday gaining another 700 AA points, they will lose the 1200 points they gained through the exploit and be refunded the 10 they earned legitimately on Tuesday.  The same will occur for any points gained by these folks from the day of the update until the day of the correction happening, they will be refunded the points they legitimately earned and have those points available to respend as they wish.<br><br>Any AA points that may have been legitimately earned on the day they participated in the exploit will unfortunately be lost.  Consider this a penalty fine for participating in the exploit."<br><br>For those worried about losing honestly gained AAs inadvertently as a result of this action, Kytherea added:<br><br>"Yes there will be a limit to the number of AAs that were earned through the exploit.  Somoene who did it once or twice will be unlikely to find they were effected by the correction.<br><br>With that said if you feel you were inadvertantly effected by the correction you can contact CS afterwards to get the issue straightened out."<br><br>Not too harsh a punishment, considering all the circumstances.  Innocent bystanders and those who did not participate will not be affected at all, only those who clearly got too many AA in a short period of time.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 25 October, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=22587">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=22587</a><br>Printed On: Wed Nov 1 12:56:13 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
