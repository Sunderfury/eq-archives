There were a ton of great candidates out there but I am happy to announce that the search is finally over!  Just a few days ago long time member of the EverQuest community, Merloc, arrived in sunny San Diego with bags in hand.  Itemization is not an easy task and I am sure he has no idea what he is getting himself into but I hope you all wish him the best of luck.  Don’t get on his case too quickly – it will be a little while until he is up to speed and doing things you can blame him for.<br><br>Merloc is a wonderful person and just so smart!  I know he will do a great job.
