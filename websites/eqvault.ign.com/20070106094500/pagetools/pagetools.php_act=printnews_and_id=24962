Here is a guild from the Tribunal server you might want to get to know:<br><br><b>Vallis Aspectus</b><br><br>Our Culture: <br>Vallis Aspectus is a family friendly guild whose members have chosen to dedicate themselves to the progression through EQ content. We have a diverse population of members from many nations around the world. Although we are focused on advancing into end game content we are not as fast paced as some other guilds. Real-life interests remain priorities as we pursue our in game goals. Members of Vallis Aspectus frown on immature or inappropriate in-game behavior, and take great pride in maintaining the traditions and values of the guild. Many of our members enjoy tradeskilling and developing new characters. In short, we have a guild of diverse members who have many in game and out of game interests who support each other in meeting individual and guild goals. <br><br>Our Current Goals: <br>Vallis Aspectus is currently farming the Citadel of Anguish, and exploring new DoDH and TSS content. <br>Raids are scheduled to occur five to six nights a week. Raid attendance is not compulsory. Most raids have scheduled start times of either 8pm or 9pm EST. Vallis Aspectus uses a DKP system to manage the distribution of raid loot. Raid attendance and loot obtained by each member is tracked in the DKP database. Probationary members are not eligible for loot except under special circumstances. <br><br>Who We Are Looking For <br>Vallis Aspectus is interested in recruiting mature and knowledgeable players of all classes. Please visit our recruitment forum at <a href="http://www.vallisaspectus.org">www.vallisaspectus.org</a> for information relevant to each class. After posting an application to the guild in the required format, you will be contacted by one of our guild recruiters for an interview. A decision whether or not to accept your application will be made by the Vallis Aspectus officer for your class. If accepted, you will be given our guild tag and enter a 30 day probationary period. Following your probationary period, the members of VA will vote whether to retain you as a full member or pass on your membership. While raid attendance is not compulsory, as described above, many members use a recruit's raid participation percentage as a gauge of their interest in becoming a full fledged member of VA.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 3 Jan, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24962">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24962</a><br>Printed On: Sat Jan 6 1:45:00 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
