A new player wants to know, what class should I choose if I want to raid?<br><br>As you might guess, the answers run the gamut from "play what you like" to "don't make a brawler" and everything in between.<br><br>Player Rijacki said it well:<br>"Remember, there are only 24 positions in a raid.  If you take two of one class, you don't have room to take one of another class.  It's all about balancing the buffs (what a class brings to a group or the raid), the debuffs (how the target can be prevented from doing it's thang), the damage output (how fast something will die die die), and minimising damage input (no one likes a wipe).<br><br>Basically, find a class YOU like and figure out how to play that class to its best."<br><br>An interesting discussion on <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/posts/list.m?topic_id=421467">raid classes in general,</a> worth a look if you enjoy the endless debate about which class is "the best."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 23 Jun, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42580">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42580</a><br>Printed On: Thu Sep 6 2:45:19 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
