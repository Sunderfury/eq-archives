There are no corpse runs under 10 and no experience loss until 11.<br><br>Corpses have the three hour rez timer, even if you dry loot them they won’t poof until after the timer is over so you can still get a rez. If you can’t get to your corpse within a week, it goes to a special zone called Shadowrest, when a corpse is in Shadowrest you will get a message as you log in. There are emissaries of Shadowrest scattered about the world, the easiest to find is the one in PoK. Her key word is "travel" whereupon you are sent to a very small suitably creepy zone (you can visit there without a corpse if you want). Others are in the EC tunnel, by the book in Tox Forest, and in the Qeynos Hills. (Please, someone, there must be emissaries in Faydwer and Kunark but I don’t know them. Add them to the info) Once you are in Shadowrest, tell the Keeper of Lost Things "relinquish" to get your corpse.<br><br>(2) PoK (Plane of Knowledge) and the Bazaar are now open to all, not just to those with the Luclin and/or PoP (Planes of Power) expansions. There is a new feature in the bazaar called Barter that requires the DoN expansion to set up in Barter mode but anyone can sell to the barter bots even without the expansion (basically the opposite of trader mode, you list what you want to get and what you are willing to pay and hope someone sells to you).<br><br>New stones have been added to PoK, there is one to the Arena zone, one to Gunthak (Legacy of Ykesha or LoY expansion), and one to Rathe Mountains where the Frogloks now live.<br><br>(3) There is a new tutorial experience. It is actually playing the game, but guided through a few small tasks. You can stay in the tutorial until 10 and most people do stay at least a few levels. This has resulted in the home towns and newbie yards to be virtually deserted.<br><br>Speaking of newbie yards, however, there was a real increase in the amount of coin and loot worth plat to vendors on newbie mobs. And speaking of home towns, when you create a character and don’t go to the tutorial, you will find you spawn right by your guildmaster. No more wandering around Neriak for hours looking for the enchanter guildmaster…<br><br>(4) AAs (alternate advancement) have made a major change in the game. Levels after 51 are not the be all and end all. The more AA you have can make a SIGNIFICANT difference in your character’s abilities. For returning players, you might have "veteran reward" AAs, which can be given to any character, regardless of level. Here’s a <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&message.id=220298">good thread</a> that tells you about AAs.<br><br>(5) Shared Bank Slots: You now have two bank slots that can transfer items between characters, plus one slot for coin. No more drop trades or finding someone trustworthy.<br><br>(6) An oldie change but a goodie, no more staring at your book to med for casters. More recently, speaking of casters, you now get at least one spell every level. <br><br>Melees now have more disciplines and other tidbits as well. When you level up and gain a skill you no longer have to run back to your guildmaster, but you only get one point in the skill.<br><br>(7) Spell Sets, new Spell Functionality. <br><br>Spell Effects and Icons: Depending on how long you’ve been gone, we’ve had a couple of changes to both the look of spells and the spell icons. <br><br>You can now make "spell sets" which save your preferred spell lineups and are faster to mem up than going through your book. You can also right click on your empty spell slot and find your spells by type. <br><br>Spells now stack, careful when you buy them from vendors so you don’t end up with 20. <br><br>Not only do they stack, but if you right click on them you can see the required levels AND a brief explanation of what each spell does. <br><br>For those that weren’t around back then, it used to be you couldn’t see the required level unless you were the class that could use them and there were no explanation.<br><br>(8) Level-based racial/class trades skill formulas have been removed. That is, for research, alchemy and poison your level is no longer a factor (once you have achieved the level to start the trade). However, you can no longer train in research above 21. Trades skill cap is 300 now.<br><br>(9) Changes in the world: <br><br>The City of Firiona Vie has fallen to the forces of evil. The good folk have fled and set up camp in the old Drolvarg Temple. <br><br>Lavastorm and Nektulos Forest have had significant redesign. <br><br>Split Paw was revamped into a high level zone, as was Mistmoore. Mistmoore has reverted to its pre-revamp form.<br><br> There are some new zones added regardless of expansion, Nedaria’s Landing is one, some were supposed to be temporary but have stayed like Veksar and Sol C. <br><br>Travel is much easier, what with new books and using the LDoN (Lost Dungeons of Norrath) Wayfarer Camp Magus (plural magii?? Never have looked that up). Anyone over level 15 can use the Magus for travel, not just people with LDoN. <br><br>(10) Server Mergers: Servers were merged early in 2005, with the larger population server retaining the name and the lower population server in parenthesis, so you might have to look a bit for your old home.<br><br>All the Zeks have been merged into one Zek, following Rallos rules.<br><br>Stormhammer (Legends) is closing down at the end of January.<br><br>FV is still up and still has the one character per account and Trivial Loot rule set.<br><br>Test is still there as well and offers 2x exp bonus plus the /testbuff command which makes your character 25 with adequate gear and all your spells/disciplines, etc. <br><br>Server populations are probably pretty equal and with probably pretty close distribution of level ranges. It is my understanding that each server now holds more people than the old days. It can seem like there are few characters under 60, but there are tons of people from 60-70. <br><br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 3 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13844">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13844</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:47:43 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
