The site stopped being updated last year, and a new site has taken its place, <a href="http://www.mmogdata.com">MMOGData.com,</a> which just released its first batch of numbers earlier this month.<br><br>IGN's RPG Vault recently published an <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/796/796435p1.html">interview</a> with the new site director, Phil "Vortal" White. White is a veteran of the gaming industry and took on the task of gathering this data with the goal of expanding on the original idea of publishing accurate information on the market size and growth of the MMO industry.<br><br>This kind of data gathering, which is considered by most MMO publishers to be proprietory, is a challenging task.  Phil White writes in his article:<br><br>"It has been a bigger task than I thought, not only trying to gather all the data - there is just less and less public information available now - why is this? In the movie industry, you can get the box office numbers from lots of different sources, but not for MMOGs; it is still all hush-hush, and with World of Warcraft redefining what is a commercial success, it gets even more difficult. <br><br>Ensuring the numbers people send me are verified also takes time, and Sony's Station Pass, which allows you to play almost any of their MMOGs, further increases the level of difficulty. However, I can say that if I cannot get two sources for the data, or it is not from official sources, it will not go into the spreadsheet - I have not, and I will not ever make any of this up just for the sake of it, but at the same time, I cannot guarantee how accurate the data is."<br><br>The article also refers to two new acronyms for revenue that MMO players will start to see more of:  buy to play (B2P) and free to play (F2P).  White plans to track data from these games as well.  SOE President John Smedley in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/business/worldbusiness/11sony.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin">recent New York Times article</a> stated that SOE will be introducing the B2P model in their newest venture, "Free Realms," aimed at young girls.   The concept of a "velvet rope," or an aspect of a game you cannot enter without paying for additional content, seems to be a hot trend for future economic models in the gaming industry.  The current pay to play (P2P) model that Western gamers are familiar with may become less common as these new ideas are implemented outside of Asia, where they have had tremendous success.<br><br>White's efforts to make transparent subscriber numbers and other data for the MMOG industry is laudable.  Although current trend for publishers is to keep the numbers hush-hush, most likely due to the fear that low numbers will send subscibers fleeing or expose waning popularity of titles, the industry can only be strengthened by the knowledge of what people are playing.  For players, facts -- not rumors -- can help boost loyalty to a title.<br><br>As White mentions, getting accurate data that reflects the actual number of people playing a game can be very difficult.  Between the efforts of game publishers to keep numbers secret and the tendency to inflate subscriber numbers, the inability to track active players versus idle accounts, the current trend of people using multiple accounts for "boxing," and other factors, the numbers will probably never be exact.  That doesn't mean that careful estimation and data gathering isn't helpful and in fact, probably does represent a fairly good snapshot of what's happening in the industry.<br><br>So where does EverQuest stand, according to White's figures?  Specifically, according to the numbers from his site in June, EverQuest has <a href="http://www.mmogdata.com/?q=node/12">1% of the market share for the genre.</a>  With an all time high of over 500,000 subscribers in September of 2004, EQ now hovers around <a href="http://www.mmogdata.com/?q=node/16">150,000 players in May 2007.</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 17 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30325">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30325</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jul 3 7:02:21 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
