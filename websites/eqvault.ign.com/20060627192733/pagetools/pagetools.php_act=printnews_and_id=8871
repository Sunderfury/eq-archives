Cost: 39pp.<br><br>New spells are in Lavastorm, not Dranik's Scar.<br><br>There are also some problems with the patch, specifically with the pet commands and with instanced zones such as Lost Dungeon of Norrath, Dragons of Norrath, and others. <br><br>/assist raid is not working.  /assist name appears to be working normally.<br><br>Grumbuk posted on EQLive:<quote>A few things did go wrong with the update, we're working on everything reported so far. Too early to say when exactly everything will be fixed. Some of the problems are related to data files that are read only at world startup so it's likely a server bounce will be required. It's unclear if a client update will be required yet. I'll post more as I have time & relevant information to add. </quote></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 29 June, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8871">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8871</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 27 12:27:33 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
