Those particular stats matter because when put together, they spell out the phone number 867-5309, made famous by the Tommy TwoTone song, "867-5309/Jenny."<br><br>Merloc replied that he hadn't meant to change them.<br><br>In 1982, the "Jenny" song peaked on the Billbord charts at number 4, making Jenny's phone number forever a part of pop culture.<br><br>You can read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny">867-5309 on Wikipedia,</a> which includes a mention of the EverQuest item.<br><br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 20 Mar, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27596">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27596</a><br>Printed On: Mon Mar 26 0:10:48 PDT 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
