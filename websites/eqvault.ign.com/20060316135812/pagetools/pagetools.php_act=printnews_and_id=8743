Want to know more about some of the guilds that you see your group members in?  Curious as to which guilds are doing the high end raid content and what they are up to?<br><br>Our new <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/static.php?page=cazic.list">annotated guild listing</a> gives you links to guild websites, where the guilds fall in raiding content, and recruiting status and policies in one handy list!<br><br>We are starting with the Cazic Thule server, and will continue to add guild listings for all EverQuest servers in the coming weeks.  If your guild isn't on the listing, or if you would like more information posted, then be sure to contact us.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 24 June, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8743">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8743</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:58:12 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
