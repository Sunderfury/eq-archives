Here's the full post:<blockquote>Hey folks,<br><br>It seems that some among our community have figured out a way to duplicate mission crystals and are being naughty.  In order to prevent the naughty folks from taking advantage of this obvious bug, we will be removing the mission NPCs from the world for a while.  The mission NPCs will return once the bug is corrected and those who have exploited it pay penance.  Additionally the crystals will be temporarily made no-drop while we correct the issue.<br><br>We are tracking this issue and are aware of the folks that are using the bug.  Their duped crystals will be wiped.  Items purchased with the duped crystals will be removed and accounts that were found to be duping may face disciplinary action, which can include banning of the account.  If you have duped crystals or items bought with duped crystals we encourage you to delete them now.<br><br>Brenlo the Dupe Buster</blockquote>Hopefully everything will be fixed soon.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 17 February, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=5566">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=5566</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 27 16:23:14 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
