In point of fact, playing often is more interesting than other things people have to do, thus causing people to choose being online rather than say, going to work or going to the family reunion.  That is a much more complicated and interesting issue.<br><br>John Smedley, in one of his earlier <a href="http://soulkerfuffle.blogspot.com/2006/10/view-from-top.html">blogs</a>, defended the game companies and put the blame for poor choices on the players, not the game designers.  I <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Columns.Detail&id=29&category_select_id=6">disagreed</a> with his insistence that the game companies had no blame at all, because MMOs are designed to be immersive, and that is a choice they make that encourages extreme play behavior.  Still, I am not one of those people who think everyone who plays is going to end up an addict.<br><br>In reading the article, I found a couple of intriging things about the WoW community that are in contrast to the EverQuest community. The main subject of the story, an ex-WoW player and uber guild leader, claims that after leaving the game, everyone in his guild forgot about him.  Of course, he played 180 days and only two years ... a drop in the bucket for a lot of EQ old schoolers.  Nevertheless, forgetting someone once they stop playing is just not EverQuest community behavior -- I know many people who do not play EQ anymore that are still remembered and liked by their former guilds and friends, and who would never be "just another guy."  Our community is more tight-knit than that.  The second is that the author of the article could get not one person to talk about marriages that came about due to online friendships -- and that's another phenomenon that's well documented in the EQ community.  These two examples reminded me of how the EQ is known for being a group oriented, community-centric game while World of Warcraft is for the more casual, less engaged player.<br><br>Because of its intensity, challenge, and world size, EverQuest is the granddaddy of games when it comes to players who were "addicts," as the issue first garnered attention from EQ players.  Now, when WoW has eight million players, or so they say, the issue comes to light again.   The light at the end of the tunnel this time, though, is that along with the bad, researchers are finding that there's a lot of good that comes from having online friendships and experiences in MMOs.<br><br>Some people may be addicted, but a lot more are having a great time.  If you are addicted, of course get help.  Doing anything too much is probably not good for you.  But for the majority of the rest of us, MMOs are a great lifestyle.  Just remember, if they are posting warning signs about how something is bad for you, it must be pretty fun!<br><br><br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 18 Feb, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26686">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26686</a><br>Printed On: Tue Feb 27 21:26:24 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
