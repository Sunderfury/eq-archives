And since the need is time, and the gain is thousands of dollars, it's an attractive business proposition to hire low paid laborers to do the work to supply characters, items and platinum for those who can afford to pay real world currency for them.<br><br>The debate about whether purchasing characters, items, or plat to increase one individuals enjoyment of the game is legitimate or not will go on.  As you may recall, SOE is starting it's own, legitimate outlet for this kind of commerce in EQ2.  However, the black market still thrives.  It is important for those purchasing these items over the internet to understand at least where the problem with this "victimless crime" occurs:  in the workplace, which can be compared with sweatshops in other industries.  The owners of the companies make seven figures, but the workers make almost nothing to supply gamers with their desired game experiences.  Buyer beware!</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 9 July, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9132">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9132</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:39:44 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
