A. to 5% of its total hit points, it will deactivate. This signals the end of a wave. I.R.A. will reactivate automatically after 60 seconds, initiating a new wave. The way to "win" this raid is for a player raid group to withstand the highest number of waves on a specific server within one hour. Players will be able to complete the scenario if the one hour point is reached while a wave is underway. Players can end the raid at any time after each wave.<br><br>Rewards: Individual rewards for this raid event will be calculated based on the best attempt for each player. Every participant in a raid group on each server will receive a clockwork abacus that is used to track their progress. Once the results for all raids have been tabulated across all servers, a scaling item reward* will be given to players based on their relative performance in the raid.<br><br>The first round of this raid scenario ends on 6/22, so get ready to have some fun! Check the leader boards table of guilds & players to track your progress and compete with your friends. <br><br>Good luck adventurers!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 19 Jun, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42459">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42459</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 18 9:10:25 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
