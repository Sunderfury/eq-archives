This year the light-hearted holiday festival includes new themed quests including “Shot through the heart” and “What’s love got to do with it”, and the returning favorites, “Love Lines” and “Find ’em a Find, Catch ’em a Catch”.  During this holiday players also have a chance of finding love notes or message candies when they kill mobs all across Norrath. This love loot is used in holiday tradeskill recipes and can be exchanged for Erollisi coin, the holiday currency that several Erollisi merchants require for purchase. Also, there are new themed items for crafting, new items for purchase from holiday merchants and more, all available through Tuesday Feb. 16. <br><br>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.eq2players.com">www.eq2players.com</a>. </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 13 Feb, 2010<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=56227">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=56227</a><br>Printed On: Sun Oct 21 4:53:23 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
