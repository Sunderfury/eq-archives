This includes more than 1,000 items from all over the expansion.  Also, to allow players who have deleted items a chance to get them again, the rewards you get for completing a mission the first time are now given to you whenever you complete the mission and do not already have the reward.<br>We've also made many tuning changes to the DoD missions to provide a smoother ramp up in difficulty over the course of the expansion.  In general, earlier missions are now a bit easier and missions further into the expansion are now a bit more challenging, particularly the hard level missions.<br><br>*** New Monster Missions ***<br>- A gnollish zealot has been spotted near the bridge in South Karana. He speaks of the rift within Paw and the final whereabouts of the son of Ishva Mal. Perhaps there is still hope for the prisoners within.<br>- The Solusek Mining Company has begun recruiting clockwork pilots for a special mission.  Report to Clockwork Commander Widgetsworth in Lavastorm for further details. <br><br>*** Spells ***<br>- Several of the abilities used by NPCs in the Demi-Plane of Blood have been modified.<br>- The Enchanter spell Apathy of the Nihil has been replaced with Dreary Deeds, an upgrade to Forlorn Deeds.<br>- E`ci's Frosty Breath and Glacier Breath are now much harder to resist.<br>- Blood of the Spire is now a more potent mana preservation focus.<br>- Ravenous Hunger has been changed. It is now named "Ravenous Sloth" and is a 40% duration extender on the spell "Lingering Sloth".<br>- The Aura of Arcanum line of spells should now have the correct spell description.<br><br>*** Items ***<br>- Pumpkin lovers rejoice! Pumpkin items now stack.<br>- The spell Servant of Marr now properly requires Ink of the Companion.<br>- Some of the ores that did not stack before now stack.

The Greatsword is also more visually imposing.<br>- All none/none flagged containers in the game are now flagged as all/all. This should fix some issues with containers not showing up in varied item searches in the bazaar and item point vendors.  <br>- Some of the "Last Blood" augmentations now have stronger focus effects.  <br>- Darkhollow Constitutional will now return a normal cork, not the dissolving kind.  <br>- Statuette of the Tranquil is now called "Amice of the Tranquil" and is a shoulder slot item. The AC has been increased and the avoidance has been replaced with accuracy. <br>- Woven Shadow Shroud is now called "Woven Shadow Stone" and is a range slot item.

Missions that could be finished very quickly are now worth less experience and missions that are taking longer to complete are now worth more experience.<br>- High Seas Rogues have regained the ability to evade!  <br>- All Drachnid Hive level 65 missions should now give out the appropriate one time rewards.  <br>- Artisan Dosan Vis’Moor, Vivian Selgan, and Gart Okken should now be accepting items for the tasks that they give.  <br>- Additional text has been added to the "Investigate a Disappearance" task that begins in Freeport that should help clear up a confusing spot late in the task.  <br>- Aid Fimli in the Plane of Knowledge will now reward you with a cloak of lesser pernicity that matches the stats of the original cloak of greater pernicity. In addition the cloak of greater pernicity has been changed to be no drop.  <br>- The Misty for You quest now works properly.<br><br>*** UI ***<br>- The GuildManagement window has a new tab "Information", which contains the MOTD fields, as well as two new fields for Guild web URL and Guild channel specification.
