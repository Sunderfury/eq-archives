'Lore' should be almost invisible because the story is told by the zone, the npcs, the conversation and the mood of the zone or encounter. But it's also great to present the lore in as many ways as possible, including on the web. Usually individual missions wouldn't have a web component, only an expansion launch or a major world event but the concept is the same."<br><br>I hope on this website the community can gather and share lore to enhance everyone's appreciation of the game, besides just immersing yourself in the game action.<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 10 July, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19209">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19209</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 1:25:35 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
