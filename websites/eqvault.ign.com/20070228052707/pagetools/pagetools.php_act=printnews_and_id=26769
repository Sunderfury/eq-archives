This will not in any way be economical as there is no discount for the needed gear sets just because you have already completed a previous upgrade.<br><br><br>*** Progression ***<br><br>- Made a number of changes to the Serpent Spine Frostcrypt progression series. It should now take less time to be eligible for the final Frostcrypt instances.<br>- Added faction modifiers to many of the Frostcrypt raids and events that take place within the Frostcrypt instances.<br><br><br>*** Tasks ***<br><br>- Corrected an issue with the task "Confront Emperor Vaakish" that would prevent the task from resetting properly in certain cases.<br>- Corrected several issues with the task "Stop the Ritual". We were unable to stop the guards from warping in some cases but they will now return to the temple if they do warp. Additionally added a failsafe to respawn any "missing" NPCs that are needed for the task should they disappear.<br>- The Portal Activation quests will no longer trigger ambushes for a task you do not have. If you manage to get both tasks, you will still get triggers for both until you finish one.<br><br><br>*** Miscellaneous ***<br><br>- The Nurtha Event in Vergalid Mines should now function properly.<br>- Removed the imps from the Demi-Plane of Blood.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 21 Feb, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26769">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26769</a><br>Printed On: Tue Feb 27 21:27:07 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
