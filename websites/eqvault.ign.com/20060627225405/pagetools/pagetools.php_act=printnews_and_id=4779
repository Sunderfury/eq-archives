When you petition in-game, using the new CS Assist tool, you will see a whole new interface which allows the use of our self help tools as well as contacting a GM!  We hope you find the new tool to be easier to use and more efficient.<br><br>Thanks!</blockquote><br>Sounds good, hopefully it speeds up response time from GMs as well.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 13 January, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4779">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4779</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 27 15:54:05 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
