Additionally, EQ subscribers who have already purchased Underfoot can login to experience Convorteum on March 10, 2010 and will receive an exclusive Gnomework Mercenary Skin if redeemed prior to March 31, 2010.<br><br>For a limited time, the Underfoot expansion is available from the Station Store for a discounted price of $34.99 plus applicable taxes. Offer ends March 31, 2010.
