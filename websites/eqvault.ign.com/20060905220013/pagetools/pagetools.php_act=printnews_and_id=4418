If you could have one AA, item, flag, or spell what would it be?"</blockquote><br>Next, Kytherea wants you to <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=51256&no_redir=true#M51256">get creative</a> with this: <blockquote>This weeks discussion topic is another creative endeavor, in celebration of the holiday season, whatever type of holiday you might celebrate. For example: write an EQ themed poem,  song (with the traditional holiday song the words are sung to) or your favorite screen shot doctored into a holiday theme.  Any creative idea you might have is certainly acceptable.  Please make sure whatever you decide to post is PG-13.  Have fun!</blockquote><br>Sounds like fun!
