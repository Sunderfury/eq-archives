EQ looked surprisingly large to my eye.  Now, I said before this FanFaire that the attendance would be smaller than Las Vegas, I was wrong.  Before walk-in¡¦s were counted (which have reached as high as 20%) attendance at this Fan Faire in Atlanta had already exceeded the total attendance at any Fan Faire for the last two years.  Did I mention the line?<br><br>Right on time Sony Online Entertainment threw open the doors and ushered fans into their home for the next 3 days.  Every year there are improvements, but this year they were more than incremental.  Registration desk ran great for a while, until their printer broke ¡V but even then they kept right on truckin¡¦ ushing people around with hand-written badges.  They registered a thousand people quickly and folks soon got down to the business at hand.<br><br>In the far end of the room, a large viewing area was setup to allow fans to watch the participants in the Best of the Best contest ¡V 6 folks at a time from each server duked it out toe to toe in the arena.  Fighting skills counted for a lot ¡V but with a large crowd watching the gigantic monitor there was much politic¡¦ing from the crowd, ¡§Get the Gnome --- he¡¦s hiding over there¡¨ someone yelled.  ¡§Ranger, ranger, ranger¡K¡¨ was being chanted at one point as 5 brave folks chased one poor little ranger around the arena (was that the Ranger by any chance with the 14,000++ mana?) ¡V oh well, he died ¡V err¡K Ranger Gated.  <br><br>Other folks were angling to grab time a system to just play and there were plenty of systems, as of late Friday there were still a lot of open time slots to sign up and play.  SoE was prepared this year for the numbers they had.  While this article is starting to sound like a love-fest, let me back it up and say that this year I was highly disappointed in the brunch.  Now, having spent a fair amount of time in hotels ¡V let me say I¡¦ve seen better.   The Mariott service people were abysmal.  If it wasn¡¦t for Kwill ninja¡¦ing a pot of coffee from the servers station ya¡¦ll would not be reading this.  And I have one bone to pick, while it was awesome to sit around for a couple of hours (once Kwill harvested some coffee for us) ¡V BRUNCH=Breakfast + Lunch.  Eggs, bacon, hash browns, muffins, pasteries, sausage, rolls, fruit, juices, etc¡K - this my friends is breakfast, a fine breakfast ¡V but it was not lunch.  The dev¡¦s were great ¡V stopping at tables, taking questions ¡V engaging in dialogue with players, just chatting ¡V it made for a great morning, in spite of the fact that this was breakfast, not BRUNCH ƒº.<br><br>The Everquest II live quest, is fun.  It¡¦s just a lot of fun ¡V and I don¡¦t just mean the opportunity to chat with Brassy who¡¦s won and or been top 10 in the costume contest more often than I can count at fan faire.  So after the clues and hailing the NPC¡¦s who must feel at home on Firiona Vie as they maintain their character with a few Oscar worthy performances as players dash around the hotel, build advanced computational models and conducting google searches in an effort to crack the code.  It¡¦s a little wacky and a lot of fun ¡V the best part is how the live quests take a very wide variety of talents, a team of all computer scientists or all English professors is guaranteed to lose out to a well balanced group.<br><br>The meat and potatoes, while absent from the mis-named brunch, is present in hearty helpings for the forums.  The developers have their courage and damage shields up as they took an average of over 100 questions per hour.  They engaged in lengthy discourses on topics so diverse there was even a non-Sony person giving a well attended forum on using the in-game map making tools.  It ended up being an unintentionally humorous session when he logged into his personal account live and in full view of entire audience on a 20 foot big-screen monitor, his guild engaged in some *lively* guild banter ¡V not fully realizing at first they were being viewed by a majority of fan faire attendees while the intrepid Enchanter demonstrated to us how to get the maximum benefit and beautiful maps out of the in game system.<br><br>The close of the forums led into wild pre-party hosted by Sony for the players with appetizers and munchies flowing, then the fans took to the streets of Atlanta in a full sized, multi guild raid on The Tabernacle, a 3 story complex with two live stages going all nite long, not nearly enough time for Karaoke, and an open bar provided by Sony for the fans.  Rock on SoE!  The music, the karaoke and the booze flowed on to midnight.<br><br>Attendance I¡¦d guess to be around 1500 players, and the diversity of players is amazing.  I¡¦ve seen children talking about DPS as young as 9 and I¡¦ve run into a few folks in their 70¡¦s ¡V Everquest seems to know no bounds in the people it attracts from all walks of life.  Meeting your guild members face to face can bring some fun revelation into the game ¡V a few of our guild members got together for dinner, and our raid officer Tico led the way on the streets of Atlanta, a natural role for him.  While our large pink ogre lady tank Bunnie turned out to be a real Southern gentleman, a soft spoken human with a lovely wife.  Our dinner was rounded out by one of our up and coming warriors in the guild Brillar who while a little younger than some of us old folks ¡V held his own very well.<br><br>Of course, the parties did not end there.  Your intrepid EQVault reporter ended up in a room-party at the Mariott, which flowed into another room for a game of Apples-to-Apples (now the official game of Fan Faire!).  The night ended sometime around 3am.  It¡¦s a heck of a time, and we¡¦ve still got another very full day to go.  Until tomorrow, this is Pakse from Fan Faire Atlanta 06 ¡V good night, good luck and I still need make a Tipt run.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 8 Apr, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16506">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16506</a><br>Printed On: Tue Aug 14 15:24:25 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
