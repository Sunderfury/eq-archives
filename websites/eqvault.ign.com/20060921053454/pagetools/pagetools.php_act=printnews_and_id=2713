Or should I find the designers that worked on LDoN and find out how they plan on tuning LDoN to the 65+ crowd?  Give me some ideas and i'll get you the answers!<br><br>To post a reply click "Post a comment" and let me know what you think!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 21 October, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=2713">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=2713</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 20 22:34:54 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
