This year, the emphasis was on class balance, although sessions were also held on the future of EverQuest and two open forums were scheduled for player input.  As your EQVault representative, I was there for the EverQuest discussions.<br><br><b>Community Representatives</b><br>Representatives from the community, not without controversy in some cases, were brought in by SOE a day early for round table discussions with groups of SOE developers and producers.  The groups were broken up into melee classes and caster classes, with hybrids found in both groups.  Meetings went on from 9:30am to 5:00pm, in one hour increments, starting with breakfast with all the developers and ending with the Fan Faire opening ceremonies and karaoke party at the end of the day.  All players should be well satisfied with their class representatives because they came with laptops and notes and lots of questions for the developers.  I heard a lot of, “well the ____’s will shoot me if I don’t ask this question.”  They were working for you to get your questions answered!<br><br><b>Class Discussions</b><br>I sat in with the melee group for the entire day.  Our group included seven producers and developers at any one time, including Grumsbuk, Tanker, Valar, Xenada, Rashere, Rytan, Absor, and Gordo.  The meeting was well run and each representative had a chance to bring up class issues that concerned their particular class. Overall the atmosphere was workmanlike and respectful on both sides.  The developers listened carefully and made notes, and stayed after the official time was done in one case to finish talking about an issue.  Discussion with the melee group did not include any complaining or whining by anyone, which was refreshing!  That’s not what I heard about the caster group, but since I wasn’t there, I can’t say for sure.<br><br><b>Class Utility is the Goal</b><br>The meeting began with the developers explaining that the idea behind class balance was to bring things into line, especially in the high end game, and to remove impediments to enjoyable game play.  The overarching idea is “utility” for all the classes and fun in gameplay with the least amount of inconvenience with the user interface.  They want to design encounters that use all the classes, but at the same time they want everyone to be able to work effectively in the existing encounters.  That doesn’t mean that the game play won’t be challenging, but it’s the encounters they want to emphasize, not interaction with the UI.   The dev teams are making changes slowly to see the effects, and although there was a “phase 1” and a “phase 2” in reality it is more seamless and changes are being made constantly over time.  The main issue developers have to address is player power versus NPC power and how those two things balance out.   It became fairly clear as the day wore on, that even the players can’t agree on class utility when it comes to “raiding” players versus “experience group” players, so for the developers to make changes that will please all play styles is more complex than it seems at first glance.  Utility is the goal, but utility for a pick up group or experience group is not the same utility for an Anguish or Tacvi raid, and the devs are well aware of this fact.<br><br>The developers explained that melee changes are more difficult to do that caster changes, and they have been working on spell changes for the twelve classes that rely on spells first, then on melee issues.  It was clear in my meeting room that they were very ready to listen to melee concerns now, however, and depending on the question, each specific SOE developer or producer addressed the questions that impacted his or her position and tried to answer each question as thoughtfully as they could. <br><br><b>Endurance Regeneration</b><br>One of the first issues to come up and be addressed was the problem of endurance regeneration, especially in a raid situation.  Although the endurance component is “working as intended” when using disciplines, the fact that after death it takes so long to regenerate is being looked at by the dev team as something that might need to change.  There are plans in the future for some kind of “flowing thought” type spell specifically for endurance regeneration, and some itemization to address this problem as well.  The devs don’t necessarily want melee classes to be able to regen endurance so quickly as to constantly be able to use disciplines through a regen component, but they do want players to enjoy raiding and have less down time.<br><br><b>Archery</b><br>One of the issues discussed for quite some time was archery.  The devs felt that archery is lower risk, and that the payoff should be lower, so the introduction of the powerful bows in Planes of Power made the game a bit unbalanced.<br><br><b>Berzerkers</b><br>The berzerker representative made his case for more raid utility and asked for changes to the Area Effect Warcry.  After some time in the discussion, it became clear that the original idea for the berzerker class was purely DPS, not as a main tank, although many berzerker players weren’t aware of that when they developed their characters!  The devs are also considering changes to mid-level berzerkers to give them more utility as well.  The berzerkers also wanted changes to two handed weapons, since they lose the ability to use shields and offhand items.  (The pally rep thought this was good too since their epic 2.0 is a two hander).  The dev team thought it would be possible to add another augment slot to two handed weapons so berzerkers and other two hand classes could get an extra benefit.<br><br><b>Rangers</b><br>The ranger representative had a number of issues, including adding a combat stat to ranger attack levels for the higher levels (the devs thought they could do this).  Harmony will stay outdoors, as it’s unbalancing otherwise, the team decided.<br><br><b>Aggro and Time on Target, Paladins</b><br>Much of the discussion in the melee group centered around aggro and time on target.  The paladin representative wanted more raid utility for high level paladins, whose stun aggro, although quite efficient, does not give them much for raids at the highest levels.    Although very powerful in Planes of  Power, paladin utility drops off at the highest raid level, the representative explained.  The paladin and the ranger also wanted the dev team to look at the fact that even high level characters are using level 9 stuns and snares to hold aggro.   The dev team and the representatives had a good discussion on how the hit point formula may not be the best way to rely on aggro.  Paladins, you can be pleased with your class representative, who was thoughtful and intelligent and made his points very clearly in the discussion!<br><br><b>Wizards vs. Rogues</b><br>Wizards and rogue damage was a hot topic for this community summit in both the melee and caster groups.  Wizards do as much DPS as a rogue, thanks to the Planes of Power pants, which the devs described as “unbalancing.”  However, in a later discussion I had with the wizard representative, it was clear that although a high level wizard can do as much damage as a rogue, the rogue can sustain it longer in a fight.  The dev team’s position is that things are working as intended and DSP depends on the encounter.  So don’t expect things to change, you two!<br><br><b>Rogue Issues</b><br>The two rogue representatives did very well by their class.  The mask for a “shadowman” illusion, which I understand had been tabled prior to this summit, was revisited due to the very well-stated arguments from the two rogue representatives.  In fact, the two gentlemen made the devs reconsider the issue after the explained what they wanted and why.  At first the devs couldn’t quite understand why rogues would want to be invis except for their weapons, but they soon came around to understand the “coolness factor.”  The rogues also got their issue of a droppable powerful rogue dagger that would be raid-equivalent considered by the dev team.  An impressive display of logical argument, guys! <br><br><b>Bards</b><br>Bards brought up problems with songs fading, which turns out to be a synchronization issue with client/server communication.  It’s a latency problem and although the dev team can look at it, they can’t do much about it at the present time.  Pure tones will not be changed.<br><br><b>Caster Group Summary</b><br>I did not attend the caster group sessions, but I was told the following issues were discussed:<br><br>--Scaleability of pets as a discipline line<br>--Pet focus effects actually go to 70, it’s a text bug<br>--they are looking at the baseline for spells so they can make changes<br>--a request was made to show pet spell damage<br>--clicky spells should show time remaining<br>--when AA’s fail they should not be use up the timer<br>--there is an overuse of resistances on boss mobs<br>--necros are just fine, thank you, and they don’t need more abilities!<br>--“pet kits” will be developed for the lower level mages so individual casting is cut down<br>--possibly mod rods will be scaled up for the higher levels<br>--changes to mage and shaman malo line<br>--shaman Spirit of the Eagle<br><br>I spoke to a number of community representatives after the summit had ended and asked them how they thought it had gone.  Everyone seemed very pleased and satisfied with the discussions.  One person commented that it is easier to have a face-to-face discussion with the SOE team because they see that the class representatives were not whining, but bringing up serious class concerns, and are more inclined to see the other person’s point of view.  For the developers, this kind of interaction helps them understand what is being asked for, and why as well as showing the players they really do care very much about designing and maintaining a very fun game.<br><br>For those of you who might still be skeptical that EverQuest is not going to be supported in the future, you are just wrong.  The team has plans to keep the game going and make it as cutting edge as it ever was.  EverQuest2 is developing into a very different game, just as fun, but the emphasis is on very different playing aspects than “the graduate school of MMORPEGs” EverQuest.
