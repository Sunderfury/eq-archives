We have spent some time trying to streamline the look and functionality of the AA window to cut down on the number of confusing tabs in the window and to make it easier to find the information or AA you are looking for. Below is a summary of the changes:<br><br>Reduced the tabs to 3 - General, Archtype, Class.<br><br>Added new information to each AA including an Expansion and/or a Category for the AA (Such as Luclin or Veteran Reward).<br><br>The column headings can be clicked to sort the AAs in alphabetical order by that column. So you can click on the title, the cost, the expansion, etc to see the AAs sorted by that column.<br><br>Several filters exists including: Can Purchase (The AAs you qualify to purchase based on level and prerequisites), Expansion and Category.<br><br>We hope that this will make the AA system easier to use and it will definitely make it easier for us to upgrade and add AAs in the future."<br><br>He also added:<br><br>"There are a lot of behind-the-scenes changes that are happening to support the UI change that will make my life a lot easier when making AAs. I'll have more to say about this."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 21 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29538">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29538</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 17 1:28:46 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
