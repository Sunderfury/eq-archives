Considering just EQ and EQ2 alone would cost almost 30 bucks a month separately - this is a great deal!<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 8 November, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=3266">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=3266</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 7:10:03 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
