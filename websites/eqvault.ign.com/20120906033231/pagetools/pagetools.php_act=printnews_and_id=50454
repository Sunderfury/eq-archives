The fundraising efforts culminated this week with a donation of more than $20,000 to the Child’s Play charity.<br><br>The month-long fundraising campaign supported Child’s Play; an organization that’s purpose is to improve the lives of hospitalized children across the nation. SOE donated $10 each time an EverQuest® or EverQuest® II player bought a specific Child’s Play virtual item on the Marketplace with Station Cash, SOE’s recently introduced in-game currency. The in-game items purchased by players are theirs to keep within the online virtual worlds.<br><br>“The ability of our players to make a donation of this magnitude in these tough economic times is beyond anything we could have hoped for,” said John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment. “As we continue to diversify with programs like Station Cash we will be able to offer unique items that benefit not only our players, but other partnerships and organizations such as Child’s Play in this case.”<br><br>Founded in 2003, Child’s Play is a game industry charity that is dedicated to providing children with toys and age-appropriate games at more than 40 hospitals worldwide.<br><br>For more information, visit www.childsplaycharity.org and www.station.com.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 26 Feb, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=50454">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=50454</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 20:32:31 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
