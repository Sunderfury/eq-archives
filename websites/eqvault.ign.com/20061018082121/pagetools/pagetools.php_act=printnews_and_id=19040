These two "first kiss" servers seem to be bringing people back into the game and re-energizing a lot of the old school players as well as pulling in some new folks who are up for a challenge.<br><br>Some noobs are still a little confused -- a couple of days ago in Felwithe, I heard a concerned player /ooc "why isn't Kunark and other expansions on this server?"  Get a clue, please.   No, there is no PoK, newbie armor, or fast leveling, just a lot of fun.<br><br>Here is some information from <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50182">Kytherea's Keepsakes</a> on the classes and races on the Sleeper and Combine servers.  The top three most popular classes? Warrior, cleric and druid.  Least popular? Monk and rogue ...<br><br>People do miss Iksars and Beastlords, too, if the /ooc chatter is any indication.<br><br>There are 126 guilds on the Sleeper and 67 on the Combine.<br><br>Largest Guild on The Combine: "League of Time" with 246 members<br>Largest Guild on The Sleeper: "Twisted Steel" with 252 members <br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 5 July, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19040">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19040</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 1:21:22 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
