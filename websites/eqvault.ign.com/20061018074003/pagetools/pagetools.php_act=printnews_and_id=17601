Turns out I had a blast writing some one page comics!<br><br>The SOE Comic Book Creator comes with screenshots, clip art, talk bubbles, all kinds of text ... and takes about an hour to learn!  I published my comics as jpgs so they were web friendly.<br><br>So enjoy my take on EQ life, in Kwill's World, all uploaded to our <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=FanArt.List">Fan Art</a> section of EQVault.<br><br>You can upload art, stories, and anything else to our site using this nifty system, so submit some of your own comics and other original work!<br><br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 19 May, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17601">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17601</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:40:05 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
