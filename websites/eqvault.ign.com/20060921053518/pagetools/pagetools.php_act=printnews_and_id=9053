Many server guilds publish guild news on their websites.  No need to go to our guild listing and look it all up -- now you have all the guild news, with screenshots and artwork, right here in one convenient place in the <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/static.php?page=news.server.list">Server guild news!</a><br><br>Our first server to be featured is the Cazic Thule server, so you can see what the guilds are up to there, but soon all servers will be listed and you can check out everything that's going on in your neighborhood.  Every couple of weeks, a new issue of your server's guild news will come out.   No RSS feeds, it's designed and coded like a hometown newspaper, so you will get the best of the guild news just like the guilds want you to see it!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 6 July, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9053">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9053</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 20 22:35:18 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
