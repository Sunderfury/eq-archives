Yes, says player Nendiilya, in his editorial posted on EQOutrider, but some aspects of the raiding game need to change if EQ is to keep up with the current state of MMO play, he argues.<br><br>Nendiilya has long been a top end raider in the game and community correspondent to the EQ team.<br><br>Read his article <a href="http://eqoutrider.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2259">here.</a><br><br>Edit:  I just found an <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/782/782155p1.html">article by Jeff Vogel, game designer,</a> that adds to Nendiilya's commentaries about some of the problems with raids in EverQuest.   Vogel makes the general point that killing trash mobs is boring, and shows a lack of creativity from designers.  Both writers are coming at the same problem, one as a player, the other as a designer, and they come to the same basic conclusion.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 20 Apr, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=28628">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=28628</a><br>Printed On: Wed Jun 13 6:20:49 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
