The dual worlds of Everquest and Everquest II are changing.  Sony Online Entertainment (SoE) has a year of player feedback, comments and concerns which they have reflected upon with the issues raised by the many class representatives at this year’s Summit Meeting.  <br><br>The summit was broken down into two basic discussion groups, one for each game.  The Everquest agenda was broken down as follows:<br><br>•	Growning the Game<br>•	Prophecy of Ro<br>•	Open disussion<br><br>I was happy to see the Summit Meeting open with the topic of “Growing the Game.”  When EverQuest launched, those of us who loved the game were able to rejoice for the first few years as we saw our beloved world grow stronger day by day.  No one at SoE ever thought the game would last beyond three or four years.  It has, and we’re grateful – we love the game.  However over the past few years, EverQuest has lost some ground and some new subscriptions to other games out there, notably World of Warcraft during the past year.<br><br>Thankfully, according to Brenlo, subscriptions are up.  Everquest is growing and SoE is firmly committed to supporting, encouraging and fostering that growth.  The programming team is pursuing a three pronged approach to forward development with the game.<br><br>•	Addressing existing issues.<br>•	Updating existing game content<br>•	Future content development<br><br>The development is taking a three pronged approach instead of a tiered approach due to the sheer size and scale of the game.  It may well take years to address all existing issues, many of which with content updates become obsolete, and certain content updates are themselves superseded by additional content development.  <br><br>SoE has said for some time that there is no hard level cap – and while rumored that the next expansion will bring an increase to 75, there was no confirmation of that fact from this summit.  Regarding expansions – The speed at which PoR followed DoDh is something of an issue, and while SOE has stated that the expansions were financially successful, they are examining their own timetables for release, developers and players alike would not have minded an extra month or two between those expansions.  However, it must be realized that one of the beauties of EverQuest lies in the fact that there is always new content to explore. I’ve not met anyone who has been everywhere and done everything.  The world is just too large, and that’s awesome.<br><br>While the November 2005 Fortune article made mention of SoE looking at adding real dollar transactions to existing games where that did not exist – Brenlo confirmed to me most strenuously that current EverQuest servers would never have items or plat for sale or trade for real cash, supported by SOE now, or ever.  That flat denial is welcome news to the many players who are happy to support a position that attempts to keep real market economies from the game space.  Along those lines, a very staunch stance was made the “non-game-playing farmers” were being shut down as fast as they could find them.  However, this job was admittedly not simple, nor given present tools expected at this point to be a complete wipe of those individuals who exploit the games economies for real cash.  There was vocal support that no one wanted to be playing “against” or even alongside a “cash farmer.”<br><br>Potential changes to the game being considered by EQ development include the possibility of expendable AA’s, where an AA ability once purchased could be used for N number of times and then that ability would have to be re-purchased.  There is a concern that a significant number of players have 1 character with maxed AA’s – this would provide those players with an opportunity to spend AA’s and a reason to be seeking out new AA’s.  Other options discussed are increasing the future cost of future AA’s and the possibility of moving the cost of achieving an AA point from an experienced based model to a time based model.<br><br>Specific new AA’s discussed included an option to see what buffs someone has, and to provide targeting of non-targetedable buffs (the mage player representative brought up targeted invis stones, much like they currently have targetable mod rods).<br><br>Leadership AA’s were the subject of an intense debate, as the game has progressed – many groups form where one person has some leadership AA, and therefore the group benefits as a whole by that person being the group leader. This has led to a problematic area wherein other group members who wish to gain Leadership AA’s are in fact locked out of the system by those who have already achieved them.  Among the potential changes to address this included splitting the use of benefits as leader.  Hence one person could provide benefits and mentor the other person, with Leadership AA’s being the payoff.<br><br>The suggestion that guild leaders could earn an AA ability to Death Touch with an un-resistable 64,000 hps of damage, castable only upon their own guild members, was soundly shot down, but in the meantime had the entire room in gales of laughter and nodding heads. One highly prominent guild leader maintained in all seriousness that his guilds chances for success on any given raid would be increased greatly not by adding more people to his guild, but rather by being able to kill off a select few.<br><br>Everyone is familiar with the “Instant Self Death Vet AA” – otherwise known as Lesson of the Devoted (LoTD).  Many of us smack that button with an air of trepidation as the result often seems to be we see the infamous, “Loading please wait…………” message not a full minute after punching it.  The development however was not interested in hearing about any extensions to it or changes.  The argument that you should have something left of double exp on a newly cast LoTD fell on deaf ears.  It was put to the players rather succinctly when the dev’s said, “Lesson of the Devoted is a chance at 30 minutes of double exp, not a promise of double exp.”  However, the silver lining within this cloud may be the promise extracted from the dev team that they would both consider and look into the feasibility of changing the timer on LotD to something slightly less than 24 hours to aid with the ‘creep’ factor of burning it off later and later.<br><br>Bards are not happy.  The Bard player representative was quite vocal in his criticism of Everquest’s modification caps, as I understood him – he put forth the case that Bards are now in a position where their modification exceeds the cap to modify a song.  The dev team listened, but I heard no promise of a fix in the near future for his concern.  There was talk of perhaps having songs of lower raw ability and then allowing them to be raised above the current modification cap, thereby increasing the value of a bard who has the modification ability exceeding today’s cap.  The working theory is that there is no point in advancing modification skill when a cap exists far below the average.  Do I get it?  Not entirely, I’ve got something like 460 STA, and I’m capped at like 410 – so while that is a bit of an apples to oranges miss-match, my personal sympathy is lacking I must admit.<br><br>The Paladin player representative was staunch in putting forth the point that paladin stuns do not stun the majority of even con encounters in single group situations.  The dev team did agree that the overall design working theory at this point was indeed to have a paladin in such an encounter able to actually stun said mobs – not simply casting them as a method building agro.  Hopefully, paladins will see some fruit from this tree in the future as the dev team is addressing this.  At this point, yours truly here could no longer pretend to be a passive observer – so I began a wailing lament over pressing my Lay on Hands and Staunch Recovery buttons only to find both that I am now dead and that the game has taken away my Lay on Hands or Staunch Recovery mistakenly thinking they were successfully cast.  The first reaction was one of denial, but my concerns were quickly taken up by others in the room and we did manage to extract a promise that this issue would be looked into, and fixed if possible.  There was full agreement by the end that if this was happening – it was wrong.  Pakse was told no, he’s not getting another Yaulp.  I have to admit I don’t feel the need for the mana regen – but I would like to see the attack.<br><br>However the most shocking player representative was the one who brought up an ability that overpowered his class (yeah – the simple existence of Necro’s is totally overpowering, but I’m not even going to go there) this was, wait for it – the Ranger class representative.  After we covered our laughter, he very seriously pointed out that Hails of Arrows along with Trueshot provided an AE, with no line of sight check, fully open on the C Axis without a range check and using a frontal arc providing in up to and potentially exceeding 3000 damage to 20 mobs per round through walls.  The dev team acknowledged the issue and are currently looking at it.<br><br>The class representative not claiming his class was overpowered was the Wizard rep – and the ongoing discussion of DPS took the floor.  The dev’s maintained that Wizards had the right to ask for the highest possible DPS within a very short amount of time.  The twist was that Wizards were agreeing with the dev’s – the concern was the definition of a “short amount of time”.  After looking at a 13,000 mana wizard who go from Full to 0 in under 60 seconds – the dev’s agreed to look at the possibility of increasing the mana pool for wizards.  (The ranger class rep did mention that he had 14,000 mana – I’ve never liked rangers &#61514;). Rogues are still out dps-ng wizards, which is an issue the devs want to look into as well.  But that will be probably be an ongoing debate for as long as EverQuest is around.<br><br>Mages had a simple request – and got a simple answer – their pets do invisible damage, they would like to be able to log and track that damage.  The dev’s said yes, and expect to fix this issue with a patch in the near future.<br><br>Changes to EverQuest – they are a coming.  Taunt currently is at 60% on mobs over level 60 and drops 10% per level.  This was brought up by the dev team, their current fix for the issue is going to be to scale it slower and put taunt skill back into the equation.<br><br>Druids want stances, the dev team wants druids to have stances.  It’s on the list, it’s going to happen – but not soon.  In a world of limited resources, priorities have to be assigned – and currently Druid Stances are low on the list.  But they are coming – so keep an eye out for them.<br><br>Double Experience worked for EverQuest.  Players came back to the game and after double experience there was higher overall activity and play.  Double experience will happen again, and in an attempt to provide the opportunity to a majority of players it will like spill over from or into a weekend therefore providing both weekdays and weekend days.  It will not likely happen soon – the current thought is that 2-3 days once a year is fine, and possible a second time but not routinely.<br><br>Changes the development team promised included a new guild channel which would be heard by all guild members by moderated by the guild officers so that by default only they could speak.  While it was brought up that a custom channel could serve this purpose, after noticing that a variety of guilds were using the Guild Message of the Day as a means of communicating in an on-going basis with membership during events, the channel was something that fits well with the chat service and we can expect to see this in the near future.  The notorious “Universal Chat Service” which right now in Everquest is only used for cross-server and cross-platform chatting is scheduled to become the default chat service as it does control chat in other SoE games.  We were repeatedly promised that in spite of the all too frequent, “Universal Chat Service is down” messages everyone sees periodically, the system really was stable and would hold up well when integrated.  Don’t hold your breath on this one folks – I’m just not buying it.<br><br>On the bright side, death is getting a makeover.  There may soon be options when you die of staying in the zone, returning to your bind point – waiting for a res.  This would be a welcome change for many of us and quite possibly could change the face of certain raids.  The dev team won’t commit at this point to any more than saying they are looking into providing a death choice in a similar fashion to EQ2.  Could be good, keep your fingers crossed.<br><br>The undead Shilliskin in Undershore with their special little instant complete heal spell are going to be looked into.  The dev’s sounded blissfully unaware when the Paladin rep questioned the reasonablness of this.  This one the dev’s are tracking down and looking to fix.<br><br>Some spells, notably invis and lev cannot be cast on lower level toons in all cases – this is something the dev team will be reviwing for the feasibility of modifying as the intention of level capping buffs was ment for combat active buffs and lev and invis don’t fit the mold and may therefore be expempted in all forms.  Good news to lower levels.<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 7 April, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16475">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16475</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 13 16:41:52 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
