I play on this server, and it got quite amusing as each person logged into guild chat and exclaimed "where are my hotkeys! Why is my UI messed up?"  So here's the official fix:<br><br><blockquote>Hello Folks,<br> <br>Those of you that play on this server may have noticed an issue with your UI, spell sets, etc...  This is due to the fact that the file names on this server were misspelled for the longest time.  This error has been corrected.  To restore your settings please follow the following instructions...<br> <br> <br> <br>1. Logout if you are logged in.<br>2. Go to your eq directory (c:\program files\sony\everquest usually)<br>3. Rename charname_cazik.ini to charname_cazic.ini<br>4. Rename BZR_charname_cazik.ini to BZR_charname_cazic.ini<br>5. Rename UI_charname_cazik.ini to UI_charname_cazic.ini<br>6. Now you go to your eq/userinterface directory (c:\program files\sony\everquest\userinterface usually)<br>7. Rename all the BART_charname_cazik.ini to BART_charname_cazic.ini<br>8. Now you can login again everything will be restored.</blockquote><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 16 June, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8507">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8507</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 6:00:15 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
