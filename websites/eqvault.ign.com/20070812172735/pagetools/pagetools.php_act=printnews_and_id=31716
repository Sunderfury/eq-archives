These masked and hooded servants swear an oath to Justice and must help preserve the balance between Order and Chaos."<br><br><a href="http://gamersinfo.net/index.php?art/id:1824">Gamer's Info</a> also has a detailed description of the game.<br><br>The initial cards for EverQuest items can be viewed <a href="http://legendsofnorrath.station.sony.com/rewards.vm?category=eq">here.</a>  They include a chimera and kirin mount, weapon enhancements, powerful potions, and four familiars, among other items.<br><br>Fan Faire attendee Tnexus-Prexus had this to add on the <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=116397">EQPlayers thread</a> on the topic:<br><br>"Having been there (and actually talked to Merloc about it briefly), don't expect the loot cards to be common at all. Most of them will be rare enough where it won't unbalance the game. There are also new mount loot cards and loot cards that change the graphic of your weapon to something unique."</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 4 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31716">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31716</a><br>Printed On: Sun Aug 12 10:27:35 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
