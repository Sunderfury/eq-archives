He and his team have big plans for the game, and were very excited to present two new features:  the upcoming expansion, “Depths of Darkhollow,” and the newly designed tutorial is designed to bring more players ready to play EQ into the game.<br><br>Craig wanted us all to know that his mission as director is to make the game more playable and not to ask the players to fight with the user interface.  Those issues that are interface-based are ones they want to fix so we can have fun playing good content.   It's about depth, not just making the world bigger.  He also has a mission to make sure the game attracts new players.  He explained that because of a particular number of posts by a new player, they made some changes in the game to make the learning curve just a little easier.  Old school players have learned all the lingo and know what “no drop” means, but for a new player, that phrase doesn’t make much sense.  So the SOE team changed that term to “no trade” which makes a lot more sense to everyone.<br><br>The SOE team took the concept of making the game more accessible to a new level with the introduction of a new tutorial on test called “Escape to Norrath.”  This new tutorial is planned as a stand alone feature to the game to introduce new players to EverQuest.  The hardest levels are from one to ten, in terms of getting used to the user interface, game play, and learning to group with other people.  It’s also difficult to get folks to commit to buying all the expansions and sign up for the game when they aren’t sure they are going to like it, or even be able to play at the level of difficulty EQ is known for.  And if you have tried to level up a character without two boxing lately, you know the newbie zones are pretty deserted, which makes it tough to find people to group with at the low levels.  To solve some of these problems, the SOE team has come up with a new concept.   “Escape to Norrath” allows newbie players to start characters in two separate starting zones, with lots of help from the tutorial to quest gear on Dragons of Norrath-type missions with other new players.  This small slice of the game is free, to encourage more people to give it a try.  No credit card required, and you don’t choose a server until you are done!  Plans are for players across the regular servers to be able to talk to the new players on special channels using the universal chat service.  The new level tens then transfer to the regular servers with decent gear and a good knowledge of the mechanics of game play when they are ready.  Yes, then they can return tells and know how to speak in a group, even if they don’t know all the social customs of each server community just yet.   That they have to learn on their own!  They will be coming with a bunch of other newbies as a peer group they leveled up with, though, so they will have people to play with as they advance in level.  You can also use this tutorial on the regular servers as well if you are starting a new character on an existing account, but you won’t have the ability to group with the other new characters in Escape to Norrath, which is part of it’s appeal.<br><br><br>Depths of Darkhollow Expansion<br>More fun will be had this fall when they introduce the newest expansion, Depths of Darkhollow.  The beta will begin sometime in late June or early July, and they will be looking for players and guilds to test raid content, especially.  The expansion is for levels 45 and up and will include content for Anguish-level players (and may be harder!)<br><br>Downtime and Boredom?<br>If you have ever sat in Plane of Knowledge or anywhere else waiting to get a group, you know it gets fairly tedious with nothing to do.  The developers don’t like it either, so they are thinking about introducing mini-games to the world of Norrath so individual players can start up a board game, or perhaps cards, who knows.  There won’t be any rules to these games, just the ability to call up a chess board or deck of cards and make up anything you want to play.   These min-game features would allow players to interact with one another one on one, making Norrath even more interesting to spend time in.  This is just a concept idea, but look for more about this in the future, is my prediction!<br><br>Corpse Dragging Consent – Fixed!<br>One significant change that came out of the meeting was the instant fix this weekend of corpse dragging consent at the beginning of a raid or group encounter, rather than after the death of a player.  Now, using your options window, you can auto consent your group or raid perpetually to drag your corpse.  Now you really can go afk after you die!  The players spoke, and the devs listened, very nice.<br><br>Specific Player Concerns:<br><br>A number of specific player issues came up in these sessions as well:<br><br>Model Changes<br>This came up at the community summit and all day at Fan Faire.  The problem is that each character has about 112 animations, armor, things they interact with like horses, and other things that effect the way a character looks.  The dev team, more than anyone, would like EverQuest models to look as slick as the game play is, but in fact it would take 8 ½ man years to make model changes.  That’s a lot of resources for just one aspect of the game. So for the time being, no model changes. <br><br>Class halls?  No.<br><br>Increase storage space in the guild banks? No, because there is a serious concern with server storage space if people started stockpiling more stuff.<br><br>Tradeskill items have poor or no tribute: they will look into this.  No drop items could get tribute: no way, too tempting for farmers.  The idea behind the tribute system was to remove items from the economy and provide value for items that currently have no value to players.  No drop items aren’t affecting the economy, so they don’t need a tribute value.<br><br>Stackable invis: Yes!  Shaman will soon be able to make stackable invisibility potions. <br>That’s the best clerics are going to do.<br><br>Gating roamers will be looked at.<br><br>Lull may be looked at so it goes past level 55 mobs.<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 13 June, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8418">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8418</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 6:00:11 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
