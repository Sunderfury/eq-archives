Salvatore is now out, in paperback:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593150296/103-4453235-9595022?v=glance&n=283155&n=507846&s=books&v=glance">Ocean of Tears</a> by Stewart Weick.<br><br>Steward Weick is the author of a number of fantasy books, including the "Clan Novel Saga" series.<br><br>I have no information on whether the author plays EverQuest or not, or how true this book is to the lore in the game.<br><br>Although the book project of setting well-written fiction in the EQ world sounded like a worthwhile endeavor, trying to write about a fictional world from game lore designed for playable encounters in a persistent world is more difficult than it seems.  The first novel, <i>Rogue's Hour</i>, did not seem to bear the slightest resemblance to EverQuest or the Norrath that I spend time in with my avatar.  The lore used in the book was shaky at best.  Let's hope as the series continues the books are more true to the lore our game designers and developers use.  It would help if the books were written by people who play EverQuest and understand the basic nature of Norrath and the encounters that take place there. <br><br>You can purchase the book at any retail book store.  Amazon also has it in stock, identified as "EverQuest II: The Ocean of Tears."  I did not find it listed when I searched the SOE online StationStore.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 21 November, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12884">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12884</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:02:04 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
