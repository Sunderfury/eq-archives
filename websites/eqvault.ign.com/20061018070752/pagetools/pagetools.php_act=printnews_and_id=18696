I am so excited about our new feature.  This is for the EQ community to share and contribute to, and I hope to make it the best resource on the web for EQLore and game info -- but I can only do that with your help.<br><br>The EQVault EQWikki is for anything EverQuest related, but I especially want to concentrate on gathering information on the lore of the game.<br><br>You will see on the left hand menu that you can jump to our <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com//wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Main Page</a> to get started.  You do need to register and log in to post.<br><br>To make this a helpful resource for everyone, here are the rules:<br><br>Specifically, the content should be about EverQuest Live, or EQ1, not EQ2.  In general,<br><br>Post only about game content and the community <br>No advertising of any kind <br>No copyrighted material without consent <br>No false or misleading content <br>No profanity <br>No post attacks on others <br>Do not vandalize pages <br>Do not post non-relevant content or material deemed not appropriate for the community <br>Do not post personal information of any kind (theirs or someone else’s) <br>The site staff reserves the right to remove or alter any of the wiki's contents for any reason. <br><br>Thanks for helping and I can't wait to see all your submissions.  I will continue to add content myself.  -- Kwill</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 24 June, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18696">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18696</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:07:54 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
