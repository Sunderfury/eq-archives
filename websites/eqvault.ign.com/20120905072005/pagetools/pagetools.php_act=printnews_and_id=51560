Included is the "Potion of Amnesia", which allows players to re-name themselves, and "Potion of Disgenderment", which allows players to change their gender and appearance. That's cool. Not sure how much they are charging for the gender-bending, but remember World of Warcraft started charging $15 for the service some time back. </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 8 Apr, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51560">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51560</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 0:20:05 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
