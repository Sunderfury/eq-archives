Producer Clint Worley, in response to a postive post by a player, <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=113636">posted this:</a><br><br>"I do have to say Thank You to the positive posts that I see not only in this thread but in others on the boards. The development team really pours their hearts and souls into EQ and we believe that the game is still as alive as it ever was. <br><br>It is our job to pay attention to the outstanding bugs and issues that are bound to happen in a game that is as large and dynamic as EQ. I watch CS hand off bugs to the development team each week and to be honest with you, the majority of the bugs on those lists are addressed even with the mountains of work that the developers have for expansions, Live fixes and a host of other tasks. Trust me, we know that we are making a game that not only we love but a game that the players love. <br><br>A good word goes a long way and the developers enjoy hearing that the countless hours and hard work don't go unnoticed."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 28 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30669">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30669</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jul 3 6:58:45 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
