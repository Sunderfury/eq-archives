EQ remains a group-based game:<br><br>"It was a conscious decision to put points only on missions.  EverQuest is, at its core, a group-based game and that's not something that is easy to change even if we wanted to.  It's built into EQs foundation so it behooves us to encourage and support grouping.  <br><br>That being said, we did take steps to make it possible for the solo player to reap the rewards from the point vendors by allowing them to gain the faction required to unlock tiers of items from quests and by making the points tradeable, but we have no plans to make the points accessible via non-mission content."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 15 Feb, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26590">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26590</a><br>Printed On: Tue Feb 27 21:25:54 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
