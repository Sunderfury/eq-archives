The video is very pointed statement by Loral in direct rebuttal to the Township Rebellion video of the submission of Deathknell, and expresses his position on the lack of ability to find groups in the newest expansion.<br><br>Loral is a level 70 cleric, a self-proclaimed "non-raider."  His commentaries on the lack of equivalent gear and opportunities for players who do not raid with a guild have been an important counterpoint to the raiding emphasis in the current game environment. For the non-raider to succeed, pickup groups are paramount to the game experience.  His video makes a poignant statement about the difficulty in finding a group to play with if you are not raiding.<br><br>Loral comments, "Pickup groups are a very important part of the game. Not everyone can rely on a tight knit group of friends with the right classes, right levels, right equipment power, and right time frames to meet these challenges. WOW solves this with solo content but at the expense of good group dynamics. EQ can do better."<br><br>Without the ability to easily form groups when any individual logs on, the game fabric indeed will unravel.  Two, three, and four boxing is not the answer to conquering group content to ensure character progression.  The fun of EQ is in meeting and playing with other people.  If the game is to attract and retain players, there have to be opportunities outside the raiding environment for people to enjoy the content.  One type of play style is not enough.<br><br>But is this now a non-issue? Frodlin, the warrior community representative, a member of a top raiding guild, and a self-proclaimed "SOE cheerleeder,"  <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=275100&view=by_date_ascending&page=1">comments</a> on the EQPlayers board:<br><br>"[Loral's] biggest problem is that he got everything he asked for, and is now a crusader without a crusade.   PoR was unequivocally THE least raider friendly, and THE most casual friendly expansion ever released outside of Legacy of Ykesha, he got his chance to deprive raiders of a good time, while enjoying everything he claimed to be asking for:  A method to get Qvic level armor without organized raiding, entire zones devoted to casual grouping and easy to finish quests for gear that are significantly easier and represent a no-brainer to receive in relation to the same stuff a couple expansions ago, and no group content which benefits raiders in any way.  It was the perfect expansion if you listened to what Loral wanted... and it resulted in what he got, which is the LFG movie.<br><br>One day, perhaps he'll learn that challenge is what drives people, and not "catering to the bottom".  Until then, we'll see more and more of these silly antics like the rallying of the troops because of 2 hard zones, and the "LFG because I got everything I wanted in an expansion" movies."<br><br>The best we can say is that PoR may be the most "casual friendly" according to the raiding crowd, but if the zones are empty, there's a larger problem than the design of the zones themselves.<br><br>Is creating content that is not raid oriented "catering to the bottom" as Frodlin would like us to believe? Has the creation of a large amount of single group content that does not require a raid force solved the problem of lack of opportunities and gear for the non-raider?  Many players now feel without a doubt that this issue is yesterday's news, and the issues that Loral has raised are no longer valid.  Others would say that the video does express their frustration with getting a group.<br><br>EverQuest's design and sheer size has created a huge universe of play style opportunties, much more than any other game in this genre.  It is probably inevitable that the debate over content emphasis between the non-raider and the raider will go on as long as the game keeps growing.<br><br>Whatever side you fall on in this debate, kudos to Loral and Frodlin, as well as others, for posting opinions and talking about this very important fundamental issue of game design -- the way people play the game.  This debate means we are all better informed and can form our own opinions on whether there is enough content for how each of us want to play the game.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 29 August, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20702">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20702</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 5 15:25:02 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
