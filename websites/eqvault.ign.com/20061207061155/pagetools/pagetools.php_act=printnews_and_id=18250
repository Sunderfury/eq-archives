"What's a wiki", you ask? Simple, its community driven website that allows any user (that means you!) to add, remove, or otherwise edit and change all content very quickly and easily using plain text and simple <i><a href="http://vault.ign.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_Guide" title="Quick Guide">wikitags</a></i> (similar to message board markup). This ease of interaction and operation makes a wiki an effective tool for collaborative knowledge for a community. So, if you have information about a game, a fact, news, definition, new fad, a tidbit... basically anything MMO/RPG/Gaming/Community related. Please take <br>the time and share it with this open source community format.<br><br>We have set up a few core sections, including six game wikis of up coming titles, to get this up and rolling. Which should give the wiki a solid running start. Now its waiting for people like you to start sharing knowledge!
