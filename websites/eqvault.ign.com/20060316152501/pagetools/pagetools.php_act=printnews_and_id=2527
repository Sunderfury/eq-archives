If you think you have a good story you can head over to <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&message.id=127419&no_redir=true#M127419">the thread</a> and tell your story.<br><br>Ashlanne also has started up a new thread dealing with music in EQ.  This round it's a two part question asking "What is your favorite music" and "If you could have a theme song, what would it be?".  I choose the Beverly Hills Cop theme for my gnome warrior!
