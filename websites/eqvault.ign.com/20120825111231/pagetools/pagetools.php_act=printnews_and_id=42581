Last week Torrie Dorrell, Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing for Sony Online Entertainment, graced us with an interview on this unprecedented promotion."<br><br>A great interview, with this little teaser:<br><br>"Allakhazam: The "New Adventures" page of the Living Legends site says there will be "An Event of Tremendous Magnitude" in August. Can you give us a hint? Just a teeny one?<br><br>Torrie: Well, I don't want to show ya the loot table just yet, hehe. What I will say is that it's another great layer to the Living Legacy campaign that is designed to win back the hearts of our former players while giving our current loyal players a thrill. That's really all I can say right now."<br><br>What could it be, I wonder?</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 23 Jun, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42581">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42581</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 25 4:12:31 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
