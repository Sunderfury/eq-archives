Sony Online Entertainment would like to ask you to take a moment to make a donation to the American Red Cross in order to help alleviate some of the suffering. <br><br>In EverQuest II we have added the /donate command, type in /donate to be taken to the American Red Cross's Hurricane 2005 relief page. For those members of SOE Communities in other games, you can contribute using this link, American Red Cross. The American Red Cross will process your donation and make sure that it is put to maximum use to help those whose lives have been affected by the hurricane. <br><br>Additionally, for our 13,000+ players actually in the affected areas, we will be suspending billing until such time as they are able to play again. In addition, any items or structures in any of our games, which decay over time, will be preserved until the user's next login. <br><br>Thank you in advance for your support and generosity. <br><br>The SOE Family</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 5 September, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10729">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10729</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 5 15:05:58 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
