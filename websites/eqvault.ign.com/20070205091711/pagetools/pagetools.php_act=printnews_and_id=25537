Please let me know if you have any questions!<br><br>A vendor named The Quiet Wanderer has moved into Sunderock Springs.  He offers spells and abilities of the calming persuasion, including several which were not previously available:  Song: Whispersong of Veshma, Spell: Drifting Fog, Spell: Dulcify, Spell: Nature’s Placidity, Spell: Quiet Mind, and Tome of Phantom Silhouette.<br>]<br>Based on feedback from the Druid community, Wildskin and Blessing of the Wild have been replaced on a one-for-one basis with Blistering Sunray and Sunscorch.  The old spells will be replaced with the new ones.<br><br>Based on feedback from the Cleric community, Rectitude and Cure Corruption have been replaced with Blessing of Purpose and Ward of the Dauntless.  Rectitude was swapped on a one-for-one basis with Blessing of Purpose.  However, because Cure Corruption is used by multiple classes the spell could not be swapped directly with Ward of the Dauntless, so clerics can simply no longer use the Cure Corruption spell.  Turning in a Rank III spell rune while you have Cure Corruption Rank III scribed will result in a copy of Ward of the Dauntless Rank III and a return of the spell rune.  Aside from that, Cure Corruption can be deleted from the spell book.<br><br>The statistics on the items created by Summon Aenda’s Trinkets have been improved.<br><br>The number of “procs” that Steeltrap Jaws can fire before fading have been doubled.<br><br>Skin to Vines will now work on a wider variety of NPC targets.<br><br>You can read comments from players about these changes <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Temporaryboard&message.id=655">here.</a><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 18 Jan, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=25537">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=25537</a><br>Printed On: Mon Feb 5 1:17:11 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
