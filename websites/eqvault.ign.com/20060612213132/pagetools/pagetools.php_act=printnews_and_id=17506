This patch upgrades our Test server to DirectX 9.0c, everyone on Test Server will need to upgrade to the latest DirectX run times.  This can be done by simply going to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513&clcid=0x409">Microsoft's link</a>  and following the instructions there.<br> <br>Please post any problems you encounter on the Tech Support forum.  If possible, please include what graphics card you have installed and what driver version you are running with in the post.  We will be monitoring this forum very closely to catch and fix any related issues as quickly as possible.<br><br>*** EQPlayers Upgrade ***<br> <br>EQPlayers is being upgraded to track additional data, in order to test this functionality the Test server will not be connected to the live EQPlayers service.  We expect this to last approximately 1 month.<br> <br>During this period your existing data will still be available for you to view on EQPlayers, but changes to your character will not be reflected in EQPlayers until this testing period ends.<br> <br>We try to ensure that Test server is connected to EQPlayers as much as possible, but occasional testing requires us to temporarily disable the service.  We apologize for any inconvenience.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 15 May, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17506">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17506</a><br>Printed On: Mon Jun 12 14:31:32 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
