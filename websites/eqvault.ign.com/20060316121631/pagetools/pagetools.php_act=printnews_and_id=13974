Developer Nolrog explained on the EQPlayers forums, "Where there used to be 3 city zones with sewers in each there is now a seperate sewer zone and an East Freeport and West Freeport, both of which are very large. The city is very true to the original but with updated and polished graphics."<br><br>According to Nolrog, Freeport is the only city being revamped with this expansion.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 7 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13974">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13974</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:16:31 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
