If you are more serious, your present would be a nice augment, and if you are a hard-core raider, you could be a stick man, or use your present "for an alt."  In other words, no present for you hard core leet person!<br><br>Be sure to read Frodlin's response to this post.<br><br>Does the player base need to be placated at all?  Or perhaps you agree that casual players should be given some kind of leg up to get to the end game?</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 30 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29797">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29797</a><br>Printed On: Mon Sep 3 1:02:11 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
