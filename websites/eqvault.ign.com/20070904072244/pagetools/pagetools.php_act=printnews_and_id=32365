The launch of his great air fortress Mechanotus has torn open the earth, exposing new paths into unexplored regions of the ancient continent of Faydwer. <br><br>Rediscover Faydwer as you adventure in the nearby Loping Plains, home to the soul eating wereorcs of Bloodmoon Keep. Strive to end the torment of humans and elves cursed for centuries in the Hills of Shade. All the while, an ancient menace stirs east of the Dragonscale Hills, where the prismatic dragon Kerafyrm the Awakened plans his revenge. "<br><br>On an interesting note, those who play EQII will recognize the Loping Plains as a zone name from that game -- also the home of some of Faydwer's werewolves and vampires.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 24 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32365">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32365</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 4 0:22:44 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
