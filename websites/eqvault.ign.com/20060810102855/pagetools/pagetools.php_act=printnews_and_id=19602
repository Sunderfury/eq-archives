I really think that EverQuest has a lot of life left in it, and so far everything I've seen seems to support that assumption.  There is planning for expansions two out from Serpent's Spine, and I don't see any signs of giving up the ghost.<br><br>I think most people would agree that EverQuest has improved with age; although now, unlike the early days of EQ, there's a lot more competition out there... Which means we have to work harder to stay competitive.  Having an inside look at the next expansion, I'm really confident it will be successful, in terms of improving the game.<br><br>I just logged into my old online text based MUSH that I played heavily for several years before EverQuest, and it's still doing quite well... MMOs seem to have the potential to last much longer than traditional games, so I hope that EQ will last a lot longer."<br><br>The complexity of EverQuest will always sustain it as a challenging, interesting game.   Thanks Merloc for letting us know that the developers are just as passionate about the game as the players.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 23 July, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19602">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19602</a><br>Printed On: Thu Aug 10 3:28:55 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
