I am guessing it relates to the upcoming DoN expansion.  Here's the text for you to ponder:<blockquote> Massive change is coming. All throughout the ruins of Kunark, soldiers are sharpening weapons and polishing armor. The frugal Outpost of Overthere has been thrown into a frenzy of activity, while a lone taskmaster relays information to Lanys T`Vyl herself. Bleak assassins and scouts lurk in every shadow, garnering information for their respective masters.<br><br>High upon an icy outcropping overlooking the hills of the Dreadlands, Lieutenant Ny`Rae checks the tumultous skies for a sign. A brilliant comet flashes through the sky, briefly illuminating his craggy features in blinding light. He nods grimly, and summons several messengers. Each is given a sealed scroll before melting silently into the shadows. It is time for final preparations. There is much to be done to ensure the victory of the Dark Princess, once and for all.</blockquote>And of course, the source is <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=49976">here</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 19 January, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4923">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4923</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 6:09:55 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
