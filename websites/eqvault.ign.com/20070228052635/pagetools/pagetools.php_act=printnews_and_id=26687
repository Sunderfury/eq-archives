The team worked hard to focus on content and features that would enhance gameplay, while reducing the adventuring downtime in between.  If you haven’t tried it thus far, you can find information about the expansion here.<br><br>We would like to apologize for the inconvenience of the amount of server downtime that has occurred since the release on Tuesday.  To help you enjoy this weekend, we are turning up the heat!  Experience will be increased fifty percent on Friday evening and will remain until Tuesday morning at 10 am Pacific Time.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>~ The EverQuest Team</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 18 Feb, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26687">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26687</a><br>Printed On: Tue Feb 27 21:26:35 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
