You will need to relist your bazaar items with new prices.  We apologize for the inconveneince this causes.  Going forward there should be no further issues with pricing being removed from items.<br><br>Ndaara posted this helpful info:<br><br>You can still find your old price list under the main EQ folder, it is of Type: Configuration Settings. mine is here:<br><br> c: \ Program Files \ Everquest \ bzrlog_charname_server.ini<br><br>WayennII posted on how you can find the new prices:<br><br>Its at the end of the same file using item-id and price pairs (bottom of file, new way) instead of item name and price pairs (at the top of the file, old way).  So I am guessing that not only do you have to hunt down and match name to item id yourself, but you also have to remove the now irrelevant name-price pair at the top of the file.<br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 14 Mar, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27426">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27426</a><br>Printed On: Thu May 10 19:40:27 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
