Specifically in regard to EverQuest he writes: <blockquote>There's also a lot of action on EverQuest .  We're consolidating many of the servers to keep the game an exciting place to be, and we are investing a lot of time and effort in making this game an even better experience for its many fans.  EverQuest just had its 6th anniversary on March 16th. It's very gratifying to see such a strong demand for this game, but when you look at how much of an impact EverQuest has had on so many people's lives ? not to mention the entire industry ? it's not very surprising. We continue to hear remarkable stories of how people are touched by the game. In fact, we just had a player name her daughter Firiona! </blockquote><br><br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 8 Apr, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=6715">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=6715</a><br>Printed On: Thu Jun 21 10:31:36 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
