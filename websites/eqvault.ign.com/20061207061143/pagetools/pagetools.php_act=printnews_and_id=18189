The least chosen? Erudite at 4%.  So if you start as an erudite, don't expect to see so many people in the newbie area!<br><br>Most popular class? Cleric! Guess the burn out doesn't start until later ...Second most popular is warrior and another healing class, druid.  Paladin, monk and wizard tie at 5% for the least loved.<br><br>Most popular race/class combo?  Wood elf druid, followed by dark elf necro, barbarian shaman, and human monk.<br><br>Kytherea writes, "Since the races Iksar, Vah Shir and Froglok are not yet available and the classes Beastlord and Berserker are not yet available some of these numbers may be slightly off because of people using a different race/class combination as a name placeholder. I know I for one have done this to save my future Vah Shir Rogue's name on a Wood Elf Rogue for now."<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 9 Jun, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18189">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18189</a><br>Printed On: Wed Dec 6 22:11:43 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
