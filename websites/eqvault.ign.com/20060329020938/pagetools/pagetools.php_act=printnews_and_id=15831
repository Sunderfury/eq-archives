"I've been playing video games a long time. I've been a fan of Sony Online since the first time I logged into the original EverQuest. That passion has only increased since the launch of EverQuest II."<br><br>Schilling may be one of today's top athletes in professional baseball, but off the field he plays EverQuest II.<br><br>"EverQuest II provides me an opportunity to remain in touch with my family during the incredible travel schedule of a major league baseball season," Schilling said. "One of the greatest elements of EverQuest II is that I can play when I'm on the road. My son Gehrig and I play together when I'm not working and he's not in school.<br><br>I enjoy the anonymity and the ability to interact on a personal level with people I wouldn't normally meet or know," Schilling said. "That, and the game is a riot. There's no end to it, the world is enormous, the possibilities are endless, and above all else, it's a place to go and relax amongst friends. What I can't get enough of is your ability to interact with real live people. The game's about teamwork, and knowing the right way to pick and play your class properly in such a way that it complements a group. That's why EverQuest has stayed so popular."<br><br>So yet another reason to attend Fan Faire!<br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 16 March, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15831">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15831</a><br>Printed On: Tue Mar 28 18:09:38 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
