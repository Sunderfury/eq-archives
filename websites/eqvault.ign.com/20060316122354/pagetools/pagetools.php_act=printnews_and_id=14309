We do understand that many characters were rolled back due to actions beyond their control along with those that took direct advantage of the situation.  We also understand that many other players that were not rolled back were also affected in indirect ways.  <b>This weekend we will be offering double experience to all players.  This will require us to take down the servers early tomorrow morning and they should be up and offering the modified experience at 9am PST.  This event will run until Monday morning at 10am PST. </b> Once again please accept our apologies for any interruptions this has caused in your playtime.<br> <br>The EQ Team<br><br>Kytherea has clarified that this double experience includes veterans reward AAs and Monster Missions.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 20 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14309">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14309</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:23:54 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
