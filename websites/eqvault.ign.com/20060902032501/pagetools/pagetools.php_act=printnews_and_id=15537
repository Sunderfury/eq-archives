Why should people come?</i><br><br>SOE: The best part of Fan Faire is meeting face to face the folks you play with in game.  Fan Faire is like one big party all weekend, with lots of people who share a common interest with you -- the game you play.  It’s an awesome experience to share your gaming adventures in person with others who’ve had similar experiences.<br><br><br><i>How can non-gamers participate if they attend with their EQ-player family member?  Is FF family friendly?</i><br><br>SOE: While most of the panels and tournaments will be game-specific, we also plan to have several panels that are broader in scope, and that talk more about the making of video games and industry issues.  Might be fun for budding game designers!  Then there are events like the Live Quests and Costume Contest, which will be open to all attendees and are fun for the whole family.<br><br><i>Kwill: What kind of prizes will players get for competing in some of the events?  What live events and tournaments are being offered?  Anything new from last time?  What will the live quest be like this time?</i><br><br>SOE: We’re still working out all the prizes, but the loot table will include flat-screen TVs, digital cameras, camcorders and more. We’ll also have a lot of goodies from our partners like Logitech and nVidia as well. We can say that there will be Live Quests or other live events for each game, plus several in-game tournaments.<br><br><i>Kwill: Will the in-game prize for pre-registration be something really good for all levels of players?</i><br> <br>SOE: While we’re still hashing out the exact details of the in-game items, we can say that anyone, at any level, will receive and be able to enjoy their game-specific item when they register online.  There’s talk of a special in-game Fan Faire Tankard for EQ players.  Players will be able to claim their souvenir after the close of Fan Faire.<br><br><i>Kwill: What kinds of events are you offering so we can get to know our fellow EQ players?  I see Karaoke .... that sounds fun ...!</i><br><br>SOE: All of the events we offer – Welcome Reception, Karaoke, Live Quest, Grand Banquet, Costume Contest – are designed to be interactive and help people get to know each other.  We’ll be designating tables at the evening events by server (and by Guild, if 6 or more Guild members register online) – so look for tables with your server’s name and/or Guild and meet your fellow server mates!<br><br><i>Kwill: What kinds of costumes are allowed at the costume contest?</i><br><br>SOE: All types of costumes are allowed at the events…your imagination is your only limitation!  Get creative and have fun!  However, we must say that the hotel does have restrictions on weapons.  The hotel does not allow weapons (steel, wood, or any other simulated weapon that may pose a danger to yourself or someone else) in any public area, so please keep this in mind when planning your costume.<br><br><i>Kwill: Which SOE staff members will be attending for EQ?  Which developers and producers can the players meet at the brunch?  Where else can attendees interact with the developers or other SOE staff members?</i><br><br>SOE: We’re still working out the staff list, but we’ll be bringing at least 25 to 30 SOE Dev and Community members.  In addition to Brunch with the Dev Team, attendees can chat with the Devs and Staff during the Welcome Reception, Grand Banquet, and offsite event (to be announced shortly).  There will also be several EQ-focused Dev forums with question and answer periods.<br><br><i>Kwill: Will attendees that don't attend the brunch get to talk to Kytherea and the community managers?  What about the spell, trade skill, and the other designers?</i><br><br>SOE: Kytherea and the other Community Managers will be at the event and available for folks to speak with.  In addition to the Dev forums we already mentioned, there will be a panel with the Community Managers where attendees will have the opportunity to ask community-related questions as well.<br><br><i>Kwill: What do you mean by special break-out sessions and roundtables? What kinds of questions can you ask?  Can the player questions/issues expressed at FF influence the game?</i><br><br>SOE: While we can’t always guarantee that player questions / issues will influence the game, the feedback gathered at these sessions is invaluable to us and is always taken into consideration.  We’ll have more details on the break-outs and roundtables in the weeks to come.<br><br><br><i>Kwill: Will there be a community summit along with FF this time, and what will they be discussing?</i><br><br>SOE: There will indeed be a Summit along with Fan Faire this time around.  We’re still working out the agenda and topics…so stay tuned.<br><br><i>Kwill: If players want to party with their fellow players, what special evening events do you have planned?  Will there be a party at a nightclub nearby like always?</i><br><br>SOE: If you take a peek at the schedule you will see that the Legends Lounge, Welcome Reception, and the Grand Banquet will be great opportunities to party with your fellow players.  We’re also working out the final details on our offsite party…which we’re hoping to announce very soon.  Keep checking the website for details!<br><br><i>Kwill: Will you have server tables set up like in previous years for people to sit together?  How can players meet people from their server?</i><br><br>SOE: Once again, we’ll be designating tables at the evening events by server.  Also, Guilds who register 6 or members online will receive their own designated tables at the evening events.  We’ll also have bulletin boards in the Legends Lounge where people can leave messages for their friends.<br><br><i>Kwill: Is there a way to get in touch with players I want to meet once I am there (any message systems or lists of attendees)?</i><br><br>SOE: A list of attendees is posted on the Official Fan Faire web site.  You can also post on the Station Forums to let folks know you are coming and to pre-arrange meeting places.  Once at the event, players can check the bulletin boards at the Legends Lounge.<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 7 March, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15537">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15537</a><br>Printed On: Fri Sep 1 20:24:59 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
