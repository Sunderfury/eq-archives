The frogloks had finally lost their foothold in Grobb and now the smelling, foul race of trolls had their home back.<br><br>She kicked her steed into motion and made haste through Nektulos Forest making a cursory survey of the lands and then turned to Neriak where dark fates would soon unfurl by her ebony hand.<br><br><br><br>*** Spells ***<br>------------------------------------------------<br>- Increased the duration on Divine Avatar.<br>- Reduced the casting time on several swarm pet AAs. <br>- Modified Intensity of the Resolute so it won't be overwritten by other, lesser abilities.<br>- Using Cyclone Blade or Whirlwind Blade will no longer cause AE Taunt to be used up as well. <br>- Telekara is now slightly harder to resist, giving it an equal resist chance to other spells in the same line. <br>- Nature's Blight and Season's Fury now have 200 spell casting range.<br>- Rhythmic Reflexes and Superior Rhythmic Reflexes had their double attack values switched. This has now been corrected.<br>- Nature's Blight and Season's Fury will now not focus level 1 spells, including the Shadowknight ability Harmtouch.<br><br><br><br>*** Items ***<br>------------------------------------------------<br>- The dark side of the froglok’s can now wear the armor their culture made. <br>- Modified the stats of numerous pieces of the cultural armor and the corresponding symbols.<br>- After much chafing, and a few cracked ribs, the froglok have decided that gnome cultural armor is no longer wearable. <br>- Blessed Reviver's Charm should now calculate its stats correctly if a non-wis caster is added to the group or raid.<br>- All spell scrolls should now be stackable. Please note that if you try to scribe more than one spell scroll at one time by using a stack of spell scrolls, that you will receive an error message. You must use only one spell scroll to scribe a spell. <br>- Ancient Mist Root Stone, Refracted Dusk Amethyst, Ancient Life Root Stone, and Refracted Dawn Amethyst are now usable in the hands and wrist slots. <br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 7 September, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10783">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10783</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 27 12:01:02 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
