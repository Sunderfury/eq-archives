Our parent company IGN has partnered with the good guys over at Google to run its "Google Ads" across all of IGN's sites, which includes the Vaults. With that comes the chance of Google running a gold seller-type ad that might slip by the existing filter we help set up to ensure these ads are blocked. Because we told Google that these gold farmer type ads suck and don't belong on the Vault Network. They were more than happy to work with us to keep such ads off our sites. So, we will be watching to make sure we remove any that happen to slip through and muck up our stuff!</p><p>There is a gold lining to this situation (pun intended!). We have a system in place where any community member can submit an ad they might see via a simple and easy <a href="http://vault.ign.com/siteinfo/mail.php?staff=VaultNetwork">web form</a>. You only need to provide one of two pieces of information: Name of Ad and/or the Link for the Ad -- that's it. <a href="http://vault.ign.com/static.php?page=nogold">Click here to learn more and where to submit.</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 9 Nov, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23118">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23118</a><br>Printed On: Mon Sep 3 1:01:04 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
