Here's a clip:<blockquote><br>We are aware of the reports of characters losing access to Omens of War content and features yesterday when logging in to their accounts. If you believe you were charged for this expansion (not just entered a pre-order, but have indeed confirmed that your billing method was successfully charged), and you have lost access to the Omens content, then please contact customer service so that we may restore your lost access and correct any problem that has caused the confusion.</blockquote><br>Be sure to check out the full post right <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63626">here</a>.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 28 September, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=2015">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=2015</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 6:36:00 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
