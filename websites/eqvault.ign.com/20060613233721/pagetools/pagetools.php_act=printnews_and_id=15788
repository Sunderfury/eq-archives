Starting on March 16th, join us<br>for a month long anniversary celebration!<br>- We believe we have fixed all issues related to the<br>increased network lag when re-forming groups in a<br>raid.   Please let us know if you have any further<br>issues related to this.<br><br><br>*** Anniversary Events ***<br>--------------------------------------------<br>- Double experience!  To kick off the celebration,<br>from 12:00 PM Pacific Time on March 16th until 12:00<br>PM Pacific Time on March 20th all normal experience<br>rewards will be doubled!<br>- Fabled NPCs have returned! Many of your favorite<br>NPCs from the original EverQuest zones and Kunark have<br>been upgraded to Fabled versions that are tougher and<br>tote better loot.  And for the first time, they are<br>joined by over a hundred NPCs from Velious!<br>- New scavenger hunt! NPCs in Thurgadin, Kael, and<br>Skyshrine are looking for help finishing up some of<br>their collections.<br><br><br><br><br>*** Missions, Quests & Events ***<br>--------------------------------------------<br>- Fixed a bug in the Gilded Scroll mission that was<br>not updating the scrolls when they are looted.<br>- Five new unusual creatures have been spotted in the<br>Demi-Plane of Blood. <br>- The mini bosses in Anguish will now drop augments<br>again.<br>- Made some aesthetic changes to the Snowtail and<br>Ghost encounters in Razorthorne.<br>- Tailfang in Shar Vahl will now drop his tail on the<br>Firiona Vie server.<br>- The mission The Key to the Past should now hand out<br>an appropriate reward.<br>- Reduced the difficulty of the Oroshar encounter in<br>Arcstone.  Oroshar should now be in line with the<br>other four spirits. <br>- Modified the Sundersky encounter in Arcstone. <br>Sundersky is now more powerful, but becomes less so<br>after his four summoned winds are destroyed. <br>- Collapsed all of the missions on Spirit Hunter Elijo<br>into one mission: Mark of the Spirits.  Any previously<br>collected spirit marks can still be turned into Spirit<br>Hunter Elijo for task credit.  <br>- Ao the Fourth Born now gives out a spell scroll<br>reward for completing his mission arc.  If you've<br>previously completed all 3 Skylance Missions, then<br>simply hail Ao for your reward.<br>- For the quest, Through the Portal, a fix has been<br>made so that crazed scyrkins will drop the needed<br>shards.<br><br><br><br><br>*** AAs , Spells, and Disciplines ***<br>--------------------------------------------<br>- Temporarily removed the AA Abundant Healing.  This<br>ability was causing a conflict with the ability Gift<br>of Mana.  As Gift of Mana is generally considered the<br>more useful of the two, Abundant Healing has been<br>removed until we can resolve the conflict.  Any points<br>spent in Abundant Healing will be refunded <br>- Dispel spells can no longer be blocked using buff<br>blocking.<br>- Harmonic Dissonance now has a 15 minute reuse time<br>associated with it.<br>- Pets will no longer instantly die when told to<br>attack a trap they are not allowed to attack.  The<br>owner will receive notification about why the pet did<br>not attack.<br>- You can now remove pet buffs even if they are<br>stacked beyond 4.<br>- The buffs in the pet information window will no<br>longer show 0 time left in their tooltip.<br><br><br><br><br>*** Traps and Auras ***<br>--------------------------------------------<br>- We’ve made a change to how aura particles are<br>displayed.  You will now only see aura particles for<br>auras that are owned by someone in your group or raid.<br><br><br>- Most player cast auras will no longer cast their<br>effects every spell tick.  Instead, they will work<br>like other spheres of influence and the effect will<br>remain on an affected player as long as they are<br>within the area of the sphere and be removed from the<br>player only when they leave the sphere.  Note that if<br>you remove the effect from yourself by clicking it<br>off, you will need to leave the area of the aura and<br>return before it is reapplied.<br> -The cleric spells Aura of the Pious and Aura of the<br>Zealot have been changed slightly.  They will no<br>longer fade after a certain amount of damage has been<br>taken, but will absorb slightly less damage per hit.<br>- Traps will now apply the correct amount of damage<br>whether in a pvp setting or not.<br>- Corrected a problem that would cause older traps to<br>go off every time someone entered their area instead<br>of going off, then being inactive for a time before<br>going off again.<br>- You can now try to sense a trap even when you have a<br>PC or NPC targeted.  It you are targeting an object<br>that could be trapped (such as a chest), you will<br>still attempt to find the trap on the object rather<br>than searching the area for traps.<br>- Using pick, disarm, or inspect while invis will no<br>longer automatically make you visible.<br>- Rain spells will no longer count interactive<br>objects, traps, and auras towards the max number of<br>NPCs they can hit.<br>- Beneficial auras will now properly affect your group<br>and raid members in a pvp setting.<br>- The Aura window will not longer close when hitting<br>the escape key.<br><br><br><br><br>*** Items ***<br>--------------------------------------------<br>- Fixed the evolving item reward for the Spirit Hunter<br>Missions in Arcstone.  If you have a cloak that is<br>stuck in the second stage of the evolving item (Cloak<br>of the Spirit Stalker) speak to Spirit Hunter Elijo to<br>receive the final version. <br>- Modified the Black Orb of the Scrykin quest.  The<br>orbs of the seven dead Scrykin are now called "Gray"<br>orbs and are tradeable.  The orbs of the six living<br>scrykin will also drop off the appropriate scrykin (in<br>addition to being the task rewards for completing<br>Or`Sarro's tasks) <br>- The Enraged Flesh Armor pieces are now no trade.<br>- The Prophecy of Ro tier1/2 cleric breastplate now<br>has the activated effect of Pious Elixir<br>- The Prophecy of Ro tier1/2 shaman breastplate now<br>has the activated effect of Ghost of Renewal<br>- The Prophecy of Ro tier1/2 enchanter breastplate now<br>has the activated effect of Ethereal Rune<br>- The Saga of Skin Translations are now no-trade<br>- The Coldain Historical Seal augmentations are now<br>lore to each other<br>- Hammer of Shadows now has 300 endurance<br>- A number of items from the events in Theater of<br>Blood now have their proper stats<br>- Burning Tree Leaf now only returns at max 337 hp and<br>mana and has reduced stats.<br>- Pendant of Insurgency, Aelly’s Earring, Prickly<br>Earring, and Mary-Anne’s Ring of Insanity now have<br>monk, beastlord, and berserker as usable classes.<br><br><br><br><br>*** NPCs ***<br>--------------------------------------------<br>- Farwein Windrun has returned to his camp in South<br>Ro.  Feel free to stop by and welcome him back.  <br>- Queen Tak`Yaliz in the Desert of North Ro will no<br>longer be missing while you’re looking for her. <br>- Ping Fuzzlecutter is now carrying some tasty water! <br><br><br>- Tak`Valnakor will now properly offer all of his<br>tasks.<br>- Boomba the Big has returned to his old stomping<br>grounds near the west gate of Freeport.<br>- Vulak`Aerr, High Priest of Veeshan, has returned to<br>the Temple of Veeshan.<br>- Gnarlibramble has loot again.<br><br><br><br><br>*** Tradeskills *** <br>--------------------------------------------<br>- Changed the Stunning Bola and Explosive Bola to use<br>the new potions.  (Basic Suspension of Pestilence IV<br>and Basic Suspension of Flame IV respectively) <br>- Increased the yield on the Treant Laminating<br>Adhesive by adding one more Acid Wash to the recipe.<br>- The trivials for the Staurolite and Prestigitase<br>recipes have been appropriately altered to be more in<br>line with the result.  The trivials were on Saurolite<br>are now on Prestigitase, and vise versa.<br>- Fixed the names of the Prestidigitase items.<br>- Fixed the Reinforced medicine bags (normal and<br>foldable) to take large sized items like the medicine<br>bag. <br>- The pottery task now makes the combine check on the<br>more difficult of the pottery wheel combine or the<br>kiln combine.  You will still need to complete the<br>item (fire it) to hand into the judge.  This is to<br>enforce it being a test of the potter’s skill, not the<br>potter’s friend’s skill. <br>- Made the new throwing potions stack to 100 as the<br>old ones did.<br>- Fixed many of the old alchemy potions that were not<br>casting at the proper level.<br>- The trophy certificates will now give the trophy exp<br>to get it to a percentage appropriate to your skill<br>within the "Tier" in addition to setting the trophy to<br>the appropriate level.  This will not exceed 99%<br>though, so do not hold onto the certificate, but use<br>it before you gain more skill.  <br>- Worked Suspension of Slime potions now have the<br>proper range of 90.<br>- Drop rates on the Alchemy dropped components for the<br>new items have been increased in most cases.<br>- Modified the Distillate of Skinspikes potions to be<br>more in line with the old Kilva's series of damage<br>shield potions.<br>- Modified the Distillate of Antidote to cure multiple<br>layers of poison counters, as well as more counters<br>overall (44 instead of 36).<br>- Modified the Distillate of Immunization to cure<br>multiple layers of disease counters, as well as more<br>counters overall (44 instead of 36).<br>- Added some NPC’s to various zones to help<br>consolidate some of the alchemy herb inventory. <br>- Updated many of the trophy tasks to remove items<br>that were too rare and items that were only in zones<br>that required keys.  Ngreth is open to further debate<br>on additional items and items he may have missed. <br>Please feel free to post about it on the forums. <br>- The composite treant bows have been altered.  Those<br>that had the "calmed" versions will get a version<br>similar to the bows they had, but it will have gained<br>a slot 7 augments slot, in addition to the slot 4 it<br>already had.  The calmed compound version has had a<br>slight adjustment DOWN in the stats, but slight<br>increase in the damage and range.  The rest of the<br>calmed versions got an increase to their overall<br>stats, though there may be some shuffle.  Those that<br>had the version of the bow with the proc will get a<br>significant upgrade to their bow, but these bows no<br>longer have an innate proc.  Instead they have a slot<br>4 and a slot 7, and the players will be able to choose<br>to add a proc via slot 4, or not.  These bows have<br>also changed to attunable.  The recipes to make the<br>bows have changed, and the in game book includes the<br>changes.<br>- Altered the recipe for the Grandmaster's Medicine<br>bag.  Please see Jolum for the new requirement.<br><br><br><br><br>*** Zones ***<br>--------------------------------------------<br>- Veeshan's Peak should now be in the appropriate<br>state.<br>- Guild lobby fog issues should be resolved now.<br>- You should be able to bind in North and South Ro<br>again.<br><br><br><br><br>*** General ***<br>--------------------------------------------<br>- Windows Sticky Keys functionality on Windows 98 and<br>ME is fixed.<br>- The Auto-Bank feature now works for everyone.<br>- Procs and clickable items will no longer cause spell<br>gems to refresh randomly.<br>- You can now open up to 34 bags at once.<br>- Autofire will properly turn off when a destructible<br>object is destroyed.<br>- The Defense of Thurgadin. Dwarves at Base Camp will<br>now be more focused on recovery than combat and will<br>be less effective in battle. They will refocus on<br>Combat when they move away from basecamp <br>- The Defense of Thurgadin. The Giant Captains will<br>now strengthen their soldiers that are nearby in<br>combat. <br>- The Defense of Thurgadin. Added additional failsafes<br>to prevent the Kromzek General from failing to leave a<br>corpse<br> <br><br><br><br>*** Special Notes ***<br>--------------------------------------------<br>- We have made really good progress on the reported<br>issues of increased zoning times.  We would like to<br>thank all those that have helped with this by<br>providing detailed information.  We know what the<br>issues are and we are in the process of implementing<br>our solution.  We hope to have a fix that can be<br>tested on our Test Server within the next week or so.<br>- Just in the last couple of days we were able to find<br>the line of sight issue that some of you have been<br>reporting.  Given how close we were to our next live<br>update, we felt that there was not a sufficient amount<br>of time to properly test this change.  For this reason<br>the line of sight fix will not be in this update, but<br>will go to our Test Server this week so that we can<br>have the proper amount of testing time to ensure that<br>our fix actually fixes the problem and does not create<br>any others.  Thank you for your understanding.<br><br><br><br>-- The EverQuest Team<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 15 March, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15788">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15788</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 13 16:37:21 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
