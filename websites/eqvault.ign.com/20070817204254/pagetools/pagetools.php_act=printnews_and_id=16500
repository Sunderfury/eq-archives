He continues to work on streamlining Station Players, adding more functionality to their databases, and gathering player and guild data for more informational utility.<br><br>I expect to recieve more information on specifics in the coming week on the plans for Station Players improvements.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 8 Apr, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16500">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16500</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 17 13:42:54 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
