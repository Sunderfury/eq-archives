Along with some general improvements to the interface we are providing features previously locked behind subscription to all of our users, while providing new features to our subscribers. Keep a lookout for the following changes in the near future. <br><br><big>Features Now Available to All Users</big><br><ul><li>Registered users can read private messages from anyone and everyone.<br><li>All users can read Insider-exclusive boards but only <b><a href="http://insider.ign.com/">Insiders</a></b> can post there.<br><li>All users can use emoticons and mark-up code in their posts. <br><li>Every registered user has access to icons (80x80 pixels).<br><li>We have reduced posting time limit to 15 seconds between each post to speed things up.<br><li>Private messages are open to everyone after 20 posts, but <b><a href="http://insider.ign.com/">Insiders</a></b> can use private messages immediately.<br><li>Updated Quick Post feature with bug fixes, a new sliding interface, and new look for quick comments.</li></ul> <big>New Insider Only Features</big><br><ul><li>Insiders can have colored user names. This applies to the text but not the border. <br><li>Insiders can now upload our new biggie-sized "MegIcons" (120x120 pixels) <br><li>Insiders can upload a small signature picture which will appear at the bottom of their posts.<br><li>Insiders, VIPs and above can give themselves catchy titles under their username.</li></ul> <big>General Upgrades</big><br><ul><li>The oft-requested Icon submission tool that allows users to bypass our old approval system.<br><li>We've removed the "your message has been posted" page between messages to make posting faster.</li></ul> There are a few things to note about the new changes. The larger MegIcons will only be available to the user who upload the icon themselves; they are not stored in a shared pool like the old icons.<br><br>You can find a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board_updates_issues_questions/b5335/110309559/p1/">feedback thread</a> in the forum.
