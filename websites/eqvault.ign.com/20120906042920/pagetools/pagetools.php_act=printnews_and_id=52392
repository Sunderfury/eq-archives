These are detailed looks at the two zones, complete with pictures, both for those wanting a blast from their EQ past, and current players alike! These were two zones that pretty much creeped me out, and definitely two zones that didn't like me! Always had trouble finding my way around Guk, and always died in Unrest. Grr.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 14 May, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=52392">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=52392</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 21:29:20 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
