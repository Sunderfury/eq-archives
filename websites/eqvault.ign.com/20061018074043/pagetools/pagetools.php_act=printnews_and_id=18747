At launch, the Progression servers will consist of the EverQuest zones in Antonica, Faydwer and Odus that were available at launch back in 1999. Players will work together to level and conquer key content that will in turn progressively unlock every expansion released for EverQuest since 1999 up through 2006’s Prophecy of Ro. Players must have the EverQuest base game to begin the progression and must have purchased the software for each expansion pack they are trying to unlock. In conjunction with this unique opportunity to start over again with EverQuest, qualifying inactive EverQuest accounts will be activated for a 30-day trial period and those players will gain access to some Station Players™ features.<br>  <br>SERVER FEATURES: The Progression servers will feature the following:<br><br>·  Normal, non-PvP servers (no transfer server) titled “The Combine”  and “The Sleeper” in-game<br><br>·  Each expansion will be unlocked by the server-wide progress of the players and the content they complete <br><br>· Two new servers for past players to re-experience an untouched world where talented and skilled players reign supreme<br><br>· New players will be able to experience all of EverQuest's content and start on a level playing field with veteran players<br><br>· Relive the evolution of one of the most successful MMORPGs in history<br><br>WHEN:<br>  “The Combine” and “The Sleeper” Progression servers launch on June 28, 2006<br><br><br><b>EQPlayers notes:  We estimate that the Progression Servers will be opened approximately 3 hours after the Game Update is completed and regular servers are available on Wednesday, June 28th. </b><br> <br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 26 June, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18747">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18747</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:40:45 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
