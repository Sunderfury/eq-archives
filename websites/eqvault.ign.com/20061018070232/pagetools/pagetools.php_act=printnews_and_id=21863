Please feel free to submit your guild to me via email.  If you can send the URL and some info about your guild, that's really helpful.<br><br>The work continues on updating these lists -- I hope people find them useful.  They take a while because I go to each guild's website and look around for recruiting information.  Since the lists haven't really been updated for about a year, it's interesting to see who is still around and who isn't.  But I am glad to see new guilds popping up and better yet, that some recruiting is closed -- that should mean the server populations are healthy.<br><br>Even if you aren't looking for a guild, these lists can give you a nice idea of what everyone is doing around your server.  If you are new to the game, these lists can help you find a guild that is recruiting, especially the family guilds that welcome new players.  Even if you aren't at the uber level, the requirements for the upper level guilds are a great resource for learning what AAs, spells and gear you need for the end game.<br><br>Looking for a change?  Lots of guilds accept cross-server applications.  You can always pack up and move to another "town" (server) so to speak!<br><br>More generally, there's lots coming up on EQVault as far as content this fall -- there will be another EQ developer interview coming soon, and I have two new Kwill's Quill type articles in the works right now.<br><br>If there's something you would like to see, please write and let me know.  Thanks for reading!<br><br>Kwill<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 6 October, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21863">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21863</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:02:33 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
