The most important change to relay is that I am no longer the Editor in Chief of Vault Network. Instead, Teddy Pierson, who has previously been in charge of Vault community sites, will be taking the helm once again. He will continue to run the Planets and all future IGN Community sites as well as the IGN Community Site Manager. My position has changed and I am now the Community Outreach Manager for all of IGN. You are part of that community, so I’ll be doing plenty of reaching out to you as well. The MMO community is an integral part of the IGN Community as a whole and I hope everyone will embrace the idea of being an important part of a larger community. <br><br>My new position retains some of my old responsibilities, like getting together with developers to host developer chats or developer diaries. But some new exciting things will happen now that I can focus on community initiatives, like hosting competitions, and I plan to include the MMO community in those initiatives. I have some big plans for the future of IGN community and that includes every one of you. <br><br>You can read about all the staffing changes on <a href="http://games.ign.com/articles/977/977182p1.html">Jeremy Dunham’s recent Letter from the Editor</a>. Also, to follow all the community initiatives I’ll be working on, <a href="http://blogs.ign.com/Staci-IGN/">add me to your blog friends</a>. Join me in welcoming Teddy back to the fold – his job has just gotten so much bigger! <br><br>Thank you everyone for your support the last couple of years and I just know IGN Community Sites have a bright future. <br><br>Staci “Rosethorn” Krause</blockquote><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 30 Apr, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=52088">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=52088</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 3:39:23 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
