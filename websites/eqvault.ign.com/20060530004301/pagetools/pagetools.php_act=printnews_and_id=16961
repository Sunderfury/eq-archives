That the majority of players in the upper levels across all servers are level 70; there are many players in the lower 50s, as well -- so that's good news for getting groups.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 25 April, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16961">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16961</a><br>Printed On: Mon May 29 17:43:01 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
