The xp gains you get for that character are equivalent to what the level of the shroud gets.  So if you are level 70 shrouded to level 25 to play with lower level friends, your level 70 will gain level 25 xp while shrouded at level 25.<br> <br>Shrouds were not intended to be a viable means for soloing but to give you a fun way to group at lower levels with other people without having to log in a different character and still give benefit to your regular character.  Shrouded characters will not have the same strength and potential as a regular play character, but does offer some utility for a group who may be lacking something they feel they need or want."<br><br>Sounds good, but what else can you do with a shroud?<br><br>How about shrouding and getting experience for quests and other content that is green to your main character?<br><br>Have you tried going back and experiencing some of the lower level content you might have missed?<br><br>When you would like to play with friends and they need a cleric or a tank, shroud up you can be right there with them contributing to the group.  It's fun.  And you don't have to have so many of those alts ...<br><br>Shroud up when you are doing something in the bazaar or PoK that will use up your buff timers.  Buff timers on shrouds are suspended.<br><br>Try that Nagafen and Vox raid with your main.<br><br>Try shrouding as a rogue to do things you can't do with your main (they hide and sneak).<br><br>Check out some of the new armor quests for the newbies.  No need to roll a new character to try them!<br><br><br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 8 November, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12541">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12541</a><br>Printed On: Mon Sep 25 19:00:02 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
