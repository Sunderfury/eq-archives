Hopefully the above thread can determine if it is video cards that are causing the problem, or rule that out so the developers can look into other causes.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 1 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31602">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31602</a><br>Printed On: Sat Sep 1 4:51:11 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
