This one relates to changes happen to the Tower of Frozen Shadow, and Iceclad.  I love ToFS and I hope this draws more people to it.  Here's the text: <blockquote>What is Tserrina Syl`Tor up to?<br><br>Something terrible is afoot.  The jagged spires of the Tower of Frozen Shadow are abuzz with frenzied activity.  The typically reclusive inhabitants of the tower have been spotted outside their home.  Strange, unnatural monstrosities have spilled forth from Tserrina's den and wander neighboring Iceclad, mercilessly terrorizing anyone that dares tread too close.  Many of the indigenous kobolds have wisely taken their leave of the island, but in their place a determined band of adventurers has arrived.<br><br>The paladin Galeth and his company have taken up camp outside the tower, led there by rumors that suggest the recent dark activities may have something to do with the missing Champion of Tunare.  Hopeful against all odds, the group braves the frigid weather and faces off against legions of unheard of aberrations.  As storm clouds swirl in the skies above, blanketing them with a never-ending torrent of shadowy ice, the group struggles to uncover a way inside.<br><br>Galeth is convinced that there must be a way to unlock the portal to gain entry to Tserrina's shadowy fortress.</blockquote></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 19 January, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4926">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4926</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 27 15:54:43 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
