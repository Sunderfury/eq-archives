With 4 million users registered to-date, the site has been a runaway success in its beta phase and is scheduled to come out of beta in late August, receiving notice by industry experts. <br><br>"The biggest bit of news in the online world industry didn't come from E3 in Los Angeles...in the first 60 days of its existence, the new online virtual world Barbie Girls has signed up three million members, and they're adding new ones at the rate of 50,000 a day," said Wagner James Au, GigaOM. "This is staggering growth by any standard, but even more so because Mattel's MMO is still in Beta." <br><br>Barbie Girls is free, but you don't want to be on your Barbie yacht without the new gadet Mattel has designed to go with the MMO:<br><br>This week, BarbieGirls.com looks to build on this unprecedented growth with the highly anticipated debut of the Barbie Girl™ device.
