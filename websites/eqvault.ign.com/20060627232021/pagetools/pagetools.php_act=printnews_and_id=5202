Here's the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=49981">post</a>:<blockquote>Hot New Look for Lavastorm<br>What all has changed?<br><br>The new Lavastorm is a graphical update for both the zone and the majority of the NPCs.  It gave us the opportunity to revisit one of our favorite old world zones and it shows off what an original EQ zone looks like, when recreated in the new graphics engine.  This newly envisioned zone also paves the way for our latest expansion, Dragons of Norrath.<br><br>·What about quests/loot/drops/etc?<br><br>We kept the previous content intact, but also added new NPCs with new drops as well as task givers who will happily reward you for helping them out.<br><br>·Are the new mobs indicative of what we will see in DoN? <br><br>They sure are.  The new models you see in Lavastorm are a preview of a few of the new models featured in Dragons of Norrath.  If you think the new goblins and spiders look great, wait until you see the dragons! <br><br>·Are these mobs new or were they previously in GoD and OoW?<br><br>The NPC models in Lavastorm are brand new versions of original EverQuest models, developed specifically for Dragons of Norrath and the new Lavastorm.<br><br>·Brenlo mentioned that this zone’s art rivals that of EQII, maybe a little boast or something to spark a friendly rivalry?<br><br>EverQuest is coming up on its sixth year and we continue to provide new content that surpasses the graphical quality of most other games in the MMP space.  That’s definitely something worthy of a little boasting.  When it comes to EQII, I think sibling rivalry is probably the appropriate term.  They are family and both teams continually push each other to be the best and exceed expectations.<br><br>·Any other interesting facts or information you guys think players would want to know.<br><br>There’s more than meets the eye going on in Lavastorm.  Over the next few weeks, players should keep an eye out for unusual events and they will have the opportunity to participate in world changing events as they unfold.</blockquote><br>Interesting stuff.
