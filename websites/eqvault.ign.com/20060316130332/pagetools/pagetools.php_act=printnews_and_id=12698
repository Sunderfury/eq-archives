The rumor on the EQLive boards is the "developers are looking into it" but don't expect much of an extension.<br><br>The devs did extend it another week longer than orginally planned, so it's not all bad, but perhaps they will give those last minute people another few hours now to complete the quests -- we'll just have to see.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 14 November, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12698">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12698</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:03:32 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
