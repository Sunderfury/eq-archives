Developer Nodyin posted that he spends a lot of time on the lore and the text, so he wishes people would read it!<br><br>Some people commented they would like to read it, but are too busy avoiding aggro mobs to be able to take the time to do much more than type the trigger words.  Others say when the entire raid is clicking, it's hard to take the time to read it.<br><br>The interesting thing about reading quest texts is that you learn a lot more about the lore of Norrath, which is actually fairly complex.  Every quest has some kind of story that tries to immerse players in the world, from kill ten rats to epic quest arcs.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 15 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29370">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29370</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 18 7:07:34 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
