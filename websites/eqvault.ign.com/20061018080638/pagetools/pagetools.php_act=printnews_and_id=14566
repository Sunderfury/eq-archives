The service itself has been a great success, both in terms of usability as well as interoperability with the game. We’re looking at ways to extend the service and make it available in our other games, but setting up Station Exchange for a game takes a great deal of work."<br><br>Could it be that RMT (Real Money Transactions) handled by SOE will eventually make it to EverQuest?</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 31 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14566">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14566</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 1:06:40 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
