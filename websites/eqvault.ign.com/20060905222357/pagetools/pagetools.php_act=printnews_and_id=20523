If you know someone who claims to have pre-ordered a box I would suggest they look into getting a refund."<br><br>A manager associated with EB games also posted and claims that there is no such item in the EBGames inventory.  Buyer beware!<br><br>On a related note, you will need a credit card to purchase the expansion digitally.  Some alternatives to those with no credit card are bank debit cards, VISA gift cards, and any other "credit cards" that actually have money behind them in some account somewhere.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 23 August, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20523">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20523</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 5 15:23:55 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
