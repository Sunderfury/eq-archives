Kytherea <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=288580">clarifies:</a><br><br>"We wanted to let you know that it is intentional that Drakkin can not dye any of the armor they wear, whether it is armors from previous expansions or new armor, wearable by all or by Drakkin only.  The dye will technically take but will not appear if the character is in Drakkin form.  If a Drakkin uses an illusion to change racial graphics, the dyed armor will show as it was dyed. "<br><br>And why can't you dye Drakkin armor?  The loss of armor detail, Kyth explains:<br><br>"There may be some lore reason behind [not being able to dye Drakkin armor] but I think mainly it is because we have the ability now to offer a greater variety of skins for armor making armor sets more unique looking.  Dying armor takes away some of the detail of the armor.<br><br>I was assured though that armor sets that are not coordinating will be rectified.  So if, for instance, you find a set that is mainly black with silver bracers and silver boots but one bracer shows up green, it will be fixed so it is coordinating as it should."<br><br>So at least you won't have to be a fashion disaster!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 23 September, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21413">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21413</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:20:29 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
