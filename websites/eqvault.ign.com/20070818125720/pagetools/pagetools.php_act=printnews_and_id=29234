I personally listen to music when playing, and I am sure a lot of other people do as well.<br><br>It seems, though, that many players find that just playing doesn't require their full attention, hence the addition of TV or movie watching.  What does this say about the game?  Or about us, the players?  Too much down time?  Too much repitition that doesn't require absolute attention from the player?  Or just people that like to have lots going on at the same time? The answers to the poll might be just as interesting as the poll itself.<br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 10 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29234">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29234</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 18 5:57:20 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
