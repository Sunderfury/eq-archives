The pre-orders are authorized in batches and the process may take several hours to complete. Once billing information has been authorized for an account with a valid pre-order, the corresponding pre-order entitlements will be awarded to that account. If the billing information supplied with an order was inaccurate, there may be additional delays and you will be sent an email with instructions on how to correct the issue provided that your e-mail address on your account is up-to-date.<br><br>Thank you for your patience.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 21 Oct, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=46485">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=46485</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 20:59:45 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
