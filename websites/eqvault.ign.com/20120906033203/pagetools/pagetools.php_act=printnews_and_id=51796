It's a guide for parents featuring third-party research, survey results, and tips for parents. In addition, parents who hit up What They Play can enter the “Let the Kids Game” contest with a chance to win an Alienware laptop and a Free Realms prize pack. <br><br><blockquote>Now available at <a href="http://www.soe.com/">SOE.com</a> and <a href="WhatTheyPlay.com">WhatTheyPlay.com</a>, the brochure aims to reach out to parents to help them understand the often-overlooked benefits of playing video games, such as SOE’s upcoming free, family-friendly online game, Free Realms®. With the help of top experts, such as John Davison, co-founder of the online parenting resource What They Play, and Cheryl Olson, Sc.D., the “Let the Kids Game” brochure indicates that games are an unexpected way to not only bring families closer together but also have the potential to form future leaders.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, studies have shown that video games can be good for kids. Key findings cited in the brochure include:<br><br><ul><li>Video games are related to improvements in vision, social interaction and visuospatial cognition (a skill associated with several careers, including architecture, engineering and surgery).<br><li>Playing games together can forge stronger family ties between parent and child, and between siblings.<br><li>People who play online games often emerge as leaders since online games offer opportunities to operate in environments that are global, competitive and emphasize large-scale cooperation.</li></ul></blockquote></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 17 Apr, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51796">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51796</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 20:32:04 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
