We may or may not like our name a few years later, but for most of us, it's not worth trying to get it changed.  For those just starting out in EQ, it's important to remember that your character's name will be with you for a long time, and to make it user friendly.<br><br>Just remember, your character's name will last longer than your current mood!<br><br>EQPlayers has <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50532">posted some tips</a> on choosing an appropriate name for your character -- good advice if you are just starting out or making an alternate toon.<br><br>Here is the best section in my opinion:<br><br>Community Friendly <br><br>It's important to think about others when selecting your character's name. Your character's name is what everyone will associate with you. <br><br>Easy Pronunciation: <br>Select name that is easy to pronounce or that at least you can pronounce when asked. If you cannot even pronounce it yourself, it's probably not a good name for your character! <br><br>Easy Familiarity: <br>If you are known in other games as a particular name, it may make it easier for you to use a similar name in EverQuest to help people remember your character's name. <br><br>Easy Communication: <br>Think about others when choosing your name. If you send out a /shout, /ooc that you want someone to contact you via a tell because either you are looking for a group or need new group members, you're more likely to get a respond if your name is easy to type. In other words, you're more likely to get contacted if your name is something like George instead of Ggeeorgeoitses. </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 19 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32176">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32176</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 24 14:32:01 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
