Hello, my name is Chris and I am the brand spanking new EverQuest Producer.  Don’t despair!  I am not just some guy off the streets – I have been working on the EverQuest team for the last two years as the Project Manager and all around helpful guy.  I am sure there is one or two of you out there that remember me lurking in the shadows of a few Fan Faires.  I guess I should add in that my EQ account has been active since 1999 but that is all I am going to tell you about it.  All I need is someone claiming that I favor a certain class :-)  Well, enough about me.<br><br>We just finished a new update on December 7th which, among other things, saw the start of our holiday event.  I hope everyone will get a chance to help MC Tinkerton and his Party Machine.  Hey, who said EverQuest can’t have a sense of humor?<br><br>We have also just opened up EQPlayers and a brand new website for EverQuest.  This is something that I am really excited about.  It really puts in perspective the tremendous amount of content that has been put into EQ over the years.  This is just the beginning.  We are going to continue to add more and more features as time goes by.  I hope to hear a lot feedback from all of you to help us refine and add to the experience.<br><br>See you in Norrath!  ...except for Neriak…I’m pretty sure that I’m KoS in Neriak.<br><br>Chris Lena ~ Raghnell<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 17 December, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13510">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13510</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 26 9:16:00 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
