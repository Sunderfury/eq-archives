Check out the <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50551">screenshots at EQPlayers.</a><br><br>"Gyrospire Beza and Zeka are two of three towers made by Meldrath specifically to guard his keep and serve as a flanking force in attacks. Gyrospire Azia was destroyed in the attack by the Gnomes from Ak`Anon while Gyrospire Beza and Zeka both remain functional. Beza is currently the oldest tower. It was the second Gyrospire created, and has become the "lead" tower. Zeka is the newest tower, and one of Meldrath's experiments at an ultimate weapon. At the top of the tower is a large steam and magic powered catapult that can be used with devastating ability, though it is a bit cumbersome and ends up best used as a siege weapon. There were many failures and many tower designs before Zeka, but they all failed spectacularly. This final tower is a success. <br><br>Despite attempts to have the towers completely clockwork controlled, Meldrath found that some times a more creative brain is required. While clockworks dominate in Gyrospire Beza there are gnomes, brownies, and minotaurs in the zone as well. Gyrospire Zeka is a different story. The Captain of the tower, a steamwork, took it upon itself to remove all living creatures from its tower. It has such a hatred for anything living that it has systematically killed everything from Meldrath's gnomes to the rats in the walls. Nothing lives within this tower. The only living being that it will tolerate in its domain is Meldrath, and only because its programming to not harm Meldrath is so deep it has not been able to alter it. Meldrath tolerates this destruction because to him even his living servants are just tools to use and discard. "<br><br>My first thought here was brownies! Not those evil little brownies again!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 31 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32601">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32601</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 4 0:24:24 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
