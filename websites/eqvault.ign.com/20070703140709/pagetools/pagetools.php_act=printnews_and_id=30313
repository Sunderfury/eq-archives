When the Circle of the Crystalwing - the six dragons who defied the elders of the dragon's Nest to create a new race - sought a place to start a new race, they found the old city. It has now been adopted by the drakkin who have quickly made it their own. The drakkin culture shows in their organic items made with cloth, leather, plants, and colorful natural dyes that reflect their own vibrant colorings."<br><br>Pictures, zone information, and detailed background lore on the creation of the city and the drakkin race are all included in <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50467">On the Town of: Crescent Reach."</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 16 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30313">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30313</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jul 3 7:07:09 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
