Developer Ilucide posted some <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=15&topic_id=432749">information about the bear mount:</a><br><br>"I can totally answer some of these questions! As you level, your bear grows with you.<br><br>From 1 to 19, he's a little bearcub that follows you around.<br>From 20 to 39, he grows up and you can ride him around (a 20% speed mount).<br>From 40 to 59, he gets a saddle, and some more speed (30%).<br>From 60 to 79, he gains armor, and more speed (40%).<br>At 80, he's fully grown. He has a full set of armor & saddle and is as fast as he'll ever get (52%)."<br><br>He also adds that it's one PER CHARACTER, not account.
