The spheres/auras are a lot of fun. Arcstone has several roaming Spheres that move back and forth over the island. They're awesome to see and when they pass over you the gameplay changes for a few seconds. They're also in seveal missions (Spheres) and play a big role in Devastation.<br><br>Destructible objects and Traps are really good too. One big bonus on Traps is that we've been freed as designers from some of the limitations of the previous Trap system. We can now create content we couldn't create before. Any time a limit on creativity is lifted I think we all win.<br><br>Good Missions. I happen to think the missions in this expansion are really well done. Those that don't like Monster Missions might disbelieve this but in my opinion we took it to the next level with Monster Missions and really started to explore the potential of this feature. I mentioned the "Braaaaaains!" mission in another thread and I'll bring it up again - where else can you play as a zombie rampaging through Rivervale?!! <br><br>Good single group, small event and raid content. I think there is a lot going on for players of nearly all power levels starting at level 45 and going through the hardest of the hard core 70 raider players.
