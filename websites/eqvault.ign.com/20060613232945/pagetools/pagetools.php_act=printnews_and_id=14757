We've taken some time to evaluate the Alchemy skill as a whole and make some very substantial changes in per-combine pricing, sellback pricing, skill-up paths, and product desirability -- All of which will prove to be beneficial for patrons of the skill. <br><br>Now, without getting too deep into the changes made, and without spoiling some of the things you'll see in the expansion… We would like to take a moment here to briefly mention the more intrusive changes in the hopes that you will be able to more adequately prepare yourselves for them. <br><br>First, we have modified nearly every alchemical recipe that currently exists in game, and when these changes get pushed out to the Live servers, many of the old recipes will no longer work. This means you may find a number of the ingredients you have been carefully stockpiling for months are no longer valid. This also means that it is recommended that you use them up before the next update (which is currently scheduled for the 21st.) <br><br>Second, we have modified nearly every vendor purchased alchemical herb that currently exists in game, as well as adding a host of new herbs that we use in the new recipes. There are no cases where we increased the value of an herb, so stockpiling vendor purchased herbs now in the hopes of gaining money is a bit of a futile attempt. We do not recommend it. <br><br>Finally, we do not ordinarily announce changes of this nature, however… Given the amount of time and money that some alchemists have spent gathering materials, we would hate to see them suddenly become useless overnight. Please make sure that you use your time and items wisely and as soon as you can.<br><br>Maddoc adds: <br><br>"Any recipes that were altered will likewise be removed from your 'learned' recipe list, which means that the 'favorite' will be pointing to an invalid / non-existant recipe. <br><br>While it is by no means required, you may want to clean out your Alchemy favorites sometime prior to the update, just to be prepared for the host of new recipes that you'll want to add."<br><br>and more from Maddoc...<br><br>"I'm not out to spoil the nature of the changes before we launch the expansion, so I won't go too deep into the nature of the recipe changes. I'll just say that you guys should be pleasantly surprised when you see them. Nearly every potion recipe had a change. Nearly every 'old school' potion had an effect change. <br><br>We reworked alchemy almost completely (everything except the Omens augments and a handful of potions were touched in some way), which allowed us to create a tiered potion system that was a bit more systematic and understandable than the previous Alchemy scheme. There's a clear skillup path, both purchased and non-purchased, and it is laid out pretty well, allowing you to get up to 'X' skill with purchased items. Over that 'X' skill will require drops that have an appropriate rarity comparative to the benefit of the potion, which will get slightly more rare the higher you go. <br><br>A lot of effort went into this revamp in the hopes that we can give alchemy potions more of a market in the game, and in the hopes that we can make the potions a lot more useful than the 'old school' stat-modifying potions, similar in nature to what we did with the recent potion additions (Clarity, Heals, etc.). <br><br>We're definitely excited to get this out there for you guys and see what you guys think."</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 7 February, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14757">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14757</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 13 16:29:45 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
