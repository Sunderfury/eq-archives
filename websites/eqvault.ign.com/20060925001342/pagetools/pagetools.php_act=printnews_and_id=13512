There is no EverQuest without them.  We do believe, however, that there is a good opportunity to expand our playerbase especially when you consider the number of new players that have recently come to the genre.  At this point many of them may be looking for the kind of challenge that EverQuest has to offer.<br><br>We need to do two main things: Show people that EQ is not an old game but instead a game with a rich history and make it as easy as possible to start playing.  We will continue to update existing art and also communicate the amazing features we have been adding. EQPlayers and the redesigned EverQuest website will also show people that the game is still vibrant and relative."<br><br><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=10010">read more on CR Gaming.</a><br><br>And this should quell all the rumors started by Nanyea that I don't read his website.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 17 December, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13512">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13512</a><br>Printed On: Sun Sep 24 17:13:42 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
