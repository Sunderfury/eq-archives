I'm sure most of us already know, but if you don't:<blockquote> Now you can send in-game messages to other players even if they're not logged into the game! Here's how to use this new EverQuest feature:<br><br>1) To open the Mail Window, either click on the Mail Icon (it's new!) or use Control-M.<br><br>2) To send an e-mail, press the "Compose" button in the Mail Window. Enter the recipient's character name in the "To" field; then enter the "Subject" and type in the message. Press "Send."<br><br>3) To receive messages, click on an unread message header on the list in your Mail Window. You can also reply to the sender and forward the message to another player.<br><br>4) There are also message management features where you can order, delete, or undelete messages. And you can even send a message to yourself.</blockquote></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 22 February, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=5647">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=5647</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:58:27 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
