It lies between the continents of Antonica and Faydwer and can be crossed in either direction using the ports of Freeport and Butcherblock."<br><br>SOE has posted before and after pictures -- or past and and present, if you will -- to let you see the improvements in the zone.<br><br>Back in the olden days, I would swim wayyy out to kill the aviaks on the islands, which was almost always empty, since it was so far.  It's great to see a classic zone like this get a little face lift.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 23 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29640">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29640</a><br>Printed On: Sat Sep 1 4:54:54 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
