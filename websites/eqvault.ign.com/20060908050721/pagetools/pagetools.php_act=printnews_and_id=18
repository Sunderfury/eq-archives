<html><head><title>Farewell LineageCenter.com</title></head><body class="newsbody" ><div class=newbody><h2>EverQuest Vault -- EQ </h3><h3>Farewell LineageCenter.com</h3><p><br>The ultimate site for L2 News and Information that is known as <a href="http://www.lineagecenter.com/index.php"><b>LineageCenter</b></a> has closed due to what the manager cites as difficulties with NCAustin and the L2NA branch.  This is the site that brought the opening few glimpses of the C2 patch as the manager was able to translate them from Korean into English.<br><br>A selfless and wonderful site-op who deserves many kudos long beyond the expired site.  I wonder who will pick up the torch!<br><br>Added at 11pm EST ::<br><br>And now it appears someone out there in the fanbase tried to rip his content for fear that it would also be departing soon, and now <a href="http://www.l2resource.com"><b>L2resource.com</b></a> has been taken down.  I feel as though I have just been given a shortie.<br><br>Re-Edited 9:19am EST 13 July 2004 ::<br><br>It now appears that L2Resource is back up with a scathing introduction by Wei directed to Sir Duncan of the L2DP and NC/Austin.  I recommend finding whatever recipes or set information you need and jotting it down as the site is on extremely shakey ground.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 16 July, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18</a><br>Printed On: Thu Sep 7 22:07:20 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
