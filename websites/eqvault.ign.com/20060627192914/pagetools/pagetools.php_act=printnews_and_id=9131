When they die, the corpse disappears immediately.  They have quite alot of hp and spawn really fast.  They have a very large aggro range.  The can also invis themselves, so you have to be able to see invis to know they are there.  The are also un-trackable.  The give 2 faction hits.  + Guardians and - Dark Reign or something like that.<br> <br>The Troopers and Scouts in EC do give xp and an occasional rusty weapon.  They are both snareable, neither summon.  The scouts did not cast any spells, the troopers did.  They never snared me, but cast Asystole, Blood of Hate and Ignite Blood.  These are all Shadowknight Spells.  He never HT me.  They had a serious amount of hp.  The xp they gave was poor at best.  Not even 1% aa with aaxp set at 90%.  I can't remember which one did not give faction, but one did, one didn't.  Same faction hits as the tier'dal scouts.<br> <br>Almost forgot, they hit me for mid 600's."</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 9 July, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9131">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9131</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 27 12:29:14 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
