Absor responded to a player's allegation that they should not be bragging about working less than 90 hours a week:<br><br>"There was once a time here when we worked for three months for 80+ hours a week and then got a week off and came back to work 40+ hours for a few months, then back at the 80+ for three months.  A schedule like that will cause all sorts of problems, not the least of which is the murder of your management.  If you're working six months for 80+ hours without a massive amount of time off (or HUGE compensation), then your managers need to be replaced with ones that understand what they are doing.  I know you're not as productive right now as you are when you're working more tolerable hours.  Working while exhausted causes errors, which leads to redoing work, which leads to longer hours...<br><br>I've lived that cycle.  I've been with SOE for more than six years and I've watched our cycles get better, and I've seen the quality of work go up.  Sure, if we need to we work overtime.  But having overtime be the standard is, frankly, stupid.  I love my work.  I even do game design on my free time.  That doesn't mean that it's a good idea to fall asleep at my desk while trying to work out a design issue with a raid after building that raid over the last 90 hours of almost nonstop work.<br><br>Rashere points this out because being able to do the volume of work we do here at a high level of quality (ok, I hear the nay-sayers groaning now) is pretty impressive and is a testament to the quality of people on this team.  If there were a Developer Design-off, I'd put this group up against any in the industry."<br><br>Rashere responded as well, noting that working long hours at work is actually a management problem:<br><br>"In my experience crunch is generally caused by one of two things:  bad management or bad planning.  There is no reason that people should spend extended periods of time bunking down at work.  People need a life and just like the average age of game players has increased, so too has the average age of the developers.  A lot of them now have families, kids, and other responsibilities.  Extended crunch is simply unhealthy and incredibly inefficient.  People get burned out, turn out a lower quality product, and the amount of rework and bugs that are introduced skyrockets.  Also, employee attrition increases so you end up with high turnover and you're wasting even more time hiring and training new folks while lowering the quality of future products due to the loss of experienced developers.<br><br>So, yes, I'm very proud that we've been able to get away from long crunch periods for EQ.  It's not because we're doing less work, but because we're smarter with how we go about it and we've gotten a lot better at planning.  We actually do more with less people than we have been able to in the past and turnover on the team has dropped considerably.  When I joined the team, about half the team was fairly new.  Now, most of the devs have been on for several years and that experience is invaluable to the product.<br><br>...  Game devs are salaried employees and there have been a few lawsuits over forced crunch because of that.  A 90 hour week is paid the same as a 40 hour one and when you have no control over why you're working long hours, that's just not right. <br><br>If someone is falling behind schedule, by all means they put in the time to get caught up but forcing people to work death-march style hours to get a product out the door because you failed to plan means you've failed in your role as a leader within the team."<br><br>The player community is responding to what they feel is a lack of quality in the product, focusing on the amount of hours worked per week as a measure of the team's commitment to their work.  As the developers point out, time at a desk is a symptom of a problem, not a solution to design issue.<br><br>EverQuest has more content than any other MMO out there, and to keep producing interesting, innovative content that pleases both casual and hard core players is a challenging task. <br><br>Developer Nodyin addresses just this problem in the thread, when he expains what the problem with the energian armor turned out to be:<br><br>"Having the armor isn't the problem. The issue was related to unforeseen complexity we encountered when implementing the system. "Powered Armor" is obviously different from how normal armor works with a large variety of things that you can choose to do with it based on the power sources. Unfortunately making all that magic happen took longer than anticipated. That's the meaning behind the statement being referred to. "<br><br>Kudos to Rashere and Absor and Nodyin who took time to post on the thread and  express their persectives on quality of life in game development.   EverQuest's developer relationship with the community has grown and deepened over the years, and this thread is just one more example of the openenss and familiarity the developers cultivate with the player community.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 3 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29001">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29001</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 18 7:07:24 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
