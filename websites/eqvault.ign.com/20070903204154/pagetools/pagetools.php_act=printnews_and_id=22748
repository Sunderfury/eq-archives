This is a must read...      <blockquote>       <i>      <b>Jonric: What are some of your favorite enemies in The Serpent's Spine, and why do you regard each of them as special? </b><br>       </i>     <br>     <b>Carly &quot;Xenaida&quot; Towle<br>     Game Designer, EverQuest: The Serpent's Spine</b><br>     Queen Pelzia rules Stone Hive from atop an ornate throne within the hive itself. She has been alluded to in lore before, but actually seeing her in game amidst the evolved Bixies of Stone Hive is something special. Her encounter is particularly interesting, because Stone Hive is a low- to mid-level zone, and she is one of the first bosses that players will encounter as they play their way through The Serpent's Spine that requires some strategy and possibly more than a group to defeat.  </blockquote> <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/742/742468p2.html">Read the Rest...</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 30 Oct, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=22748">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=22748</a><br>Printed On: Mon Sep 3 13:41:54 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
