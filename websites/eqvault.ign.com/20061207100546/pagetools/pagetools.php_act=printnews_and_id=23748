This tells that anyone cannot do her business for ‘exchanging’ or ‘mediating’ exchanges of, and 'repurchasing' outcomes of games by real money. The 'outcomes' mentioned include in-game money, all kinds of in-game points, but in-game items are not among these.<br><br>According to an official concerned, RMT mediating companies can be punished for their acts of mediating in-game money. Already well known, most of RMT transactions are being done by in-game money, not specific items. So, all of these companies are at the outside of the law. <br><br>As the bill can be validated without any period of suspension, the authorities concerned can regulate any act of mediation and the mediating companies, once the bill is passed. If nothing special happen, the bill is expected to be carried by Dec. of this year. <br><br>Meanwhile, the government is also considering another regulatory measure for in-game items that are not included in the above case. After some public hearings are held, they are to submit another amendment until early of year 2007.<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 27 Nov, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23748">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23748</a><br>Printed On: Thu Dec 7 2:05:46 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
