We believe that all issues are now resolved. If you are having any problems with your guild bank or guild bank inventory please contact Customer Service.<br><br>-- The EverQuest Team</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 24 February, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15248">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15248</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 26 19:26:27 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
