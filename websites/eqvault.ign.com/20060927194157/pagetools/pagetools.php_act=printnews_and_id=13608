If you are interested in playing like it was back in the early days of EQ (old world zones, no mad twinking, no power leveling, no use of the PoK books and so forth), you can join them:<br><br>Deadcool posted on EQLive:<br><br><blockquote>We are doing it on Prexus Server. Many of us have discussed it, and that's what we came up with. It's a long road ahead, you guys. This is not going to be easy, but perhaps, it will prove our desire to SoE, and even if it doesn't, we will definitely have a lot of fun hanging out in the old world zones.<br><br>We are going to start new characters, then get the heck out of the mines of Gloomingdeep, as quickly as possible. We will all begin working out of Western Antonica. That is, Freeport, The Commonlands, Nektulos/Neriak, The Desert of Ro, and eventually we will move inland toward the Karanas, and so forth. Start your new char on Prexus, and begin playing legit, as in, no twinking. If you must give yourself a slight edge, that's acceptable, but don't show up at level 5 with level 20 equip. Just a few pieces of coinage to get your spells, and maybe a few pieces of decent-for-your-level gear.<br><br>You may begin soloing if you can't get any kind of group together. West Freeport is good for the first few levels, and East Commons is great for soloing, until about level 10 or so. By that time, we will have a lot more organization.<br><br>As soon as you start your new character on Prexus, log out of Everquest and <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&message.id=219137&view=by_date_ascending&page=1">come here</a>, post your name on the Prexus server, so that we can all get a hold of each other.</blockquote><br><br>I wish you all the best of luck in giving this a try.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 21 December, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13608">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13608</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 27 12:41:57 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
