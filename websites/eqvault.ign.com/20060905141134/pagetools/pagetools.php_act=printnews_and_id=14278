Due to the effect on the economy, SOE has been and is planning to do character "rollbacks" to take those items away:<blockquote>[posted January 18] This morning we had an error with the update that resulted in merchants, and subsequent items, in the Plane of Knowledge that should not have been appearing in the world.  In order to address this we will be performing selective and aggressive rollbacks of certain characters throughout the day.  There will be multiple phases and some characters may be subject to multiple adjustments.  If you believe that you have been involved in any way (even indirectly) then please consider holding off your playtime until tomorrow.  We apologize for the inconvenience and we are resolving this in the most complete way possible while minimizing the impact on the majority of the customers.<br><br>She further clarifies: "The rollbacks are taking people who made these purchases and people who traded with them or bought things from them to back before the update.  So people can potentially lose other things like AA & xp they have earned since then.  However we have had messages up here on the boards, the MoTDs and periodic broadcasts in the game to let the community know these roll-backs were coming and to advise people who paticipated in these actions after the servers came up to not do much to alter their characters."<br><br>Kytherea ~~wielding a giant hammer & a hairless War Hamster~~</blockquote><br><br>According to player reports, some rollbacks have already occurred.  My favorite comment from cidorxev on the EQ forums: "This was Americans being Americans, we saw a sale and we went to it."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 19 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14278">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14278</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 5 7:11:33 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
