I'm pretty excited about getting them out there for you guys."<br><br>For the first time, there will be a level 65 hot zone with this set.  The Progression servers will also have hot zones, but Nodyin notes, "As far as the new rares and itemization they will be locked until PoP is unlocked, but I believe you guys are on pace to have unlocked that expansion before the zones will go in."<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 16 Nov, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23419">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23419</a><br>Printed On: Thu Dec 7 2:04:01 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
