As always, SOE packs in information and fun into three days of activities and question and answer sessions.  This Fan Faire was no exception and I am excited to report some announcements we heard this weekend:<p><br><br><b>A New Expansion!</b><p><br><br>As I type this, folks are lined up outside my media room door to see the 20 minute movie of the newest EQ Expansion.  I haven't seen it yet, but the big scoop is players can be monsters!  More on this after I see the movie.<p><br><br><b>A New Ingame Command: autoconsent corpse drag when the raid or group begins</b><p><br><br>In the past, you could only consent your group or raid after you died -- but when players asked for the change, the developers took some  time this weekend to add a new option that allows you to persistently consent your group or raid.  Now when you die, someone can drag you no matter what you are doing -- zoning, finally taking that bio, whatever.<p><br><br><b>A New Tutorial Designed to Bring in Newbie Players</b><p><br>A new tutorial has been designed and is now on test which is self contained and will teach new players from levels 1 -10 how the world of Norrath works.  Called "Escape to Norrath" the new tutorial has a quest system with good items to quest for, more help on using the UI, and best of all, is free!  The two zones it contains will help new players find group mates and be ready to enter the larger world of Norrath when they decide they can't get enough of EQ.<p><br><br><b>Satisfied Community Summit Participants</b><p><br><br>The community summit went very well this year, according to the partcipants, and alllowed class representatives from all classes to speak directly to the programmers, developers and producers of both EQ and EQ2.  Issues were discussed in round table sessions all day Thursday, and resulted in the developers considering changes to continue to balance game play at all levels.<p><br><br>More detail on these topics and more coverage of all the happenings coming soon!<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 11 June, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8383">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8383</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 3:32:56 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
