<p>The targest and most populated continent on Norrath. The continent was known as Tunaria until renamed by the human ruler of the Free City of Qeynos, Antonius Bayle. It is on Antonica where Tunare first placed Her High Elves. Antonica is also the birthplace of the Halflings, Trolls, Ogres, and Humans. The evil stain of Innoruuk, the Dark Elves, also call Antonica home. (History of Norrath, SOE)

<b>Befallen</b> 
is located to the west of the Commonlands. Befallen was once the site of a wonderful temple, a reclusive home for the monks who maintained it. Many blame the dark elves for what it has become, but whatever the cause, Befallen is now a home to the undead its inhabitants used to hunt and destroy as well as other nefarious creatures. To go in deeper than the first floor, one has to jump through a well (deadly) or try to get a key from a named mob. Befallen is the local newbie dungeon for Freeport.
</p><p><b>Beholders Maze (Gorge of King Xorbb)</b> 
is a passage between the west and east side of Antonica. The Gorge of King Xorbb is a gorge of treacherous mazes inside the cavernous walls. The area is filled with goblins, minotaurs, and two royal evil eyes with their summoned pets.  A race of mud people, the Muddities, live in the gorge and attack all strangers.  There is also a summoned imp, Yymp the Infernal, who haunts these ravines and caverns. It joins East Karana with Runnyeye, and is part of the route to bypass Highhold Pass.
</p><p><b>BlackBurrow</b>, located on the northern part of Antonica, near Everfrost, is the home of the clan of gnolls of the same name which harass Qeynos humans and Halas barbarians. Travellers who wish to go from the home of the barbarians in Everfrost to the hill of Qeynos must go through this underground warren of tunnels and subterranean rivers.  These gnolls are known for their excellent brew, Blackburrow stout.  BlackBurrow is the local newbie dungeon for Qeynos.
</p><p><b>Cazic Thule</b><br />
The Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule lies deep in the swamps in the south of Antonica in the Feerrott, hidden on an island beneath vines and protected by its caretakers and worshippers, the lizard men. Within the temple exists a thriving community of lizard men and priests of Cazic-Thule.  You may also find Tae Ew Templars, golems, and the Avatar of Fear in the temple, as well as a lizard named Radiant. Was originally designed for players in their late 20s through their 50s, but was later revamped into a zone for players level 55+.
</p><p><b>East Commonlands</b> is the local teens zone for Freeport and Neriak, equivalent to North Ro.  Find a wayfarer camp here in the tunnel.
</p><p>This area is home to both merchants and adventurers that come from the cities of Rivervale, Freeport, and Neriak, as well as more exotic locations.  The area also has its share of monsters, including lions, bears, pumas, willoswisps, giant scarabs, spiders, snakes, orcs, an undead ruins with skeletons and ghouls, and occasionally a ferocious griffen in the skies. The merchants and adventurers that are found in this area are protected by guards from nearby Freeport. (EqAtlas)
</p><p><b>Eastern Karana</b> is a rough, partly hilly area on the eastern edge of the Plains of Karana. Possibly the most dangerous of the zones due to the various hostile animal life, griffins and evil eyes. It is connected to the rest of the world only by two narrow mountain passes and one massive bridge. Some intrepid souls make their homes out here amidst the creatures. The traveler may encounter wolves, undead reavers, huge spiders, evil eyes, undead, gnolls from the Mucktail clan, Cyclops brothers, hill giants, gorge hounds, griffons, lions, snakes, and more.  Squire Wimbley is a helpful paladin that will guide travelers through if asked. Adjacent to Highpass Hold, Beholders Maze and Northern Karana.
</p><p><b>Eruds Crossing</b> is the sea between the continents of Odus and Antonica, and offers a way to travel from the city of Erudin to the city of Qeynos. The boat passes alongside a volcanic island in the middle of the sea that is the home of some Kerrans. It is also famous for the number of Will-O-Wisps that wander on the island. Near the island is a sunken boat surrounded by sharks.
</p><p>The name of the zone which the ferry from Qeynos to Erudin passes through, and it marks the path that Erud himself travelled on his way to the island of Odus centuries ago. Erud's Crossing's only feature is an island that marks the halfway point of the trip.  This island is home to the cat people, the Kerrans, and other unique island inhabitants.  The ocean has its share of undead, killer sharks, and snakes, as well as the odd fire elemental and lost soul abandoned there. (EqAtlas)
</p><p><b>Erudin</b> is the city of the Erudites, on the continent of Odus, founded by Erud.  A beautiful city, it houses a large library where much of the knowledge of the world can be found.  The Eruidin palace houses the bank and the Magician, Wizard and Enchanter guilds in the city.
</p><p><b>Everfrost Peaks</b> is an arctic zone split into two halves. One is an icy gorge surrounded by mountains. The other is a tundra area. Everfrost has one of the highest assortments of mobs to be found in the entire game, from the newbie area to the ice giants.
</p><p>Everfrost is a permanently frozen area of frequent snowfalls and constant snow cover. It is the northernmost land of Antonica, and is adjacent to the home of the barbarians, Halas. It is also near the gnoll home of Blackburrow, where all must pass if they want to enter the lands surrounding Qeynos, and the dungeon Permafrost. 
</p><p>A frozen river divides this area into eastern and western halves, and ruins of an ancient civilization are scattered throughout the region.  The traveler can find all kinds of snow creatures here, including frost goblins, frost giants, bears, spiders, undead, mammoths, wolves, orcs, and gnolls.
</p><p><b>The Feerott</b> is the dark swampy home of the ogres and lizard men of Antonica. The ogres live in a cave system at the edge of the swamp, while the lizard men have established camps scattered throughout. It is also the home of the ancient ruined temple of Cazic-Thule.
</p><p><b>Freeport</b>is located at the eastern edge of the Antonica continent. This is a human city. The guards in East Freeport and West Freeport are a somewhat evil group called the Freeport Militia. Their sworn enemies, the Knights of Truth, are the guards in North Freeport. There is a system of underground tunnels enabling travel through the city by those unfriendly to the guards. Freeport was completely revamped when Prophecy of Ro was released. North Freeport's features were combined into West Freeport, and a new zone was dedicated to the underground tunnels. Groups of patrolling guards were added as well.  The entrance to Arcstone zone can be found here.
</p><p>Freeport is considered by most to be the hub of Antonica for a variety of reasons. It is the mercantile center of the continent, since it holds the only port with a regular boat to the island continent of Faydwer. It holds facilities for most of the artisan trades, and most budding craftsman travel to Freeport to take advantage of the readily available facilities. Freeport is also the hub for traffic of all sorts. The good races travel its streets to go to their guilds and the shops, as well as to the boat to Faydwer, and the dark races travel through the sewers to reach most of the same destinations. Guild Halls for all classes except the Rangers, Druids, and Shamans are present within the city. There are bad and good parts to the city, where one can find just about anything a heart might desire. There are pockets of corruption within the guards of Freeport, as every good paladin soon discovers.  Many good citizens allied with the Knights of Truth cannot walk the streets in safety for fear of reprisal from Sir Lucan D’Vere and his corrupt band of guards. Outside the city gates, one can find an infestation of rats, spiders, snakes, skeletons, beetles, and even small Deathfist orcs looking for unwary travelers.  (EqAtlas)
</p><p><b>Gukta, Outpost of Marr</b> is the city of the Frogloks, formerly the home of the Trolls and known as Grobb, but was invaded by the Frogloks as part of the events that happened after the release of The Legacy of Ykesha expansion. The surviving Trolls have now moved to Neriak Foreign Quarter. This zone has been reclaimed by the Trolls after the War shortly before Depths of Darkhollow Expansion release, driving the frogloks to reside in a test city in the Rathe Mountains.
</p><p><b>Halas</b> is the city of the Barbarians is found in the frozen north.  Rough and crude, the city reflects the warrior culture of its founders.
</p><p><b>Highpass Hold</b> lies along the main travel route from Qeynos to Freeport, and is a mountain pass guarded as well as possible by the valiant guards of Highpass Keep. Orcs and gnolls have patrols that run up to the foot of the Keep itself, and the brave Highpass citizens have carved out their homes out of the gulleys and nooks.
</p><p><b>High Pass Keep</b> is the seat of a former empire that used to spread its power over central Antonica in years past. Now, their reign has diminished under constant attacks by the orcs and gnolls, and is restricted to High Pass Hold now. The Pickclaw goblins mine the area below the city.  The inhabitants of High Keep thrive on trade, both legal and illegal, passing through the center of the continent, as High Pass Hold is one of the few "safe" regions to pass through, thanks to the leadership of Carson McCabe.  Visitors to the town can see High Elf Princess Lenia, smugglers, beggars, nobles and all sorts of other characters who end up here.  (EqAtlas)
</p><p><b>Innothule Swamp</b> serves as the newbie zone for Gukta.
</p><p><b>Jaggedpine Forest</b> was once the tranquil sanctuary of people devoted to the god Karana, and nobody travelled from there to the outside or back. Lately, however, gnolls have started moving between here and the area north of Qeynos.
</p><p><b>Kithicor Forest</b> is probably what is left from the old Elddar Forest together with Nektulos Forest. It is connected to the West Commonlands, Rivervale and Highpass Hold making it an important travelling zone for adventurers travelling by road from the east coast of Antonica to the middle of the continent. At day it is safe to travel through it, although some bixies and orcs can be dangerous to lower level characters. Presumably, the original intention was to provide a newbie zone for young Halflings from Rivervale; however, the generally poor hunting conditions (forest fog, limited visibility, etc) prevented the zone from ever being used as such. When the Plane of Hate (home of Innoruuk) opened with the Battle of Bloody Kithicor, the undead came to the Kithicor Forest and continue to roam it by night. The forest is inhabited by zombies and ghouls every night, making it a dangerous and edgy place for the traveller, most of whom are wise enough to wait until morning before making the crossing.
</p><p><b>Lake Rathetear</b> is a large lake with many islands is almost a small sea. Many individuals who like to get away from the main population centers come to here and the Rathe Mountains because of their relative seclusion, and the lake and its surroundings are home to many who have carved out their niche. Aviaks, spellcasters, goblins, ogres, bandits, barbarians, gypsies, gnolls, and the occasional hermit all reside in this area. The strange blue flame can be found on one of the islands guarded by aviaks.  Sometimes Princess Lenya Thex, who has been turned into a royal fish, and the froglock prince Kyrmt Keroppi can be found here.
</p><p><b>Lavastorm Mountains</b> was revamped in early 2005, and connects to Sol A (Soluseks Eye), Sol B (Nagafens Lair), the Temple of Soulusek Ro, Najena and Nektulos Forest.  
The Lavastorm Mountains are a volcanic region off the murky forest of Netekulous. A massive lava pit known as Solusek's Eye is best known landmark in the area.  Smaller lavapits dot the landscape, which is burned and barren rock dotted with twisted dead trees.  The Temple of Solske Ro can be found here, as well as Nagafen’s Lair and Solsek’s Eye.  The mountains are home to band of goblins, gypsies, baslisks, fire imps, elementals, summoned lava crawlers, and rock dervishes. The magician Najena has her ruined temple in this area.
</p><p><b>Lower Guk</b>is only accessible through Upper Guk. The Ruins of Ancient Guk is a vast array of tunnels that connect between the ruins themselves and the upper tunnelways that eventually lead to the Innothule Swamp. It is also the battleground between the living frogloks, led by the Froglok King, and the undead who have taken over most of the deepest ruins, led by their Ghoul Lord. (Eq Atlas)
</p><p>The zone itself is split in two areas, Dead side, on account of the number of undead frogloks (led by the Ghoul Lord), and Live side, home of minotaurs and froglok nobles lead by the Froglok King. In the original game (before any expansions were released), it was one of the two top zones in the game (with Nagafen's Lair). It was never safe to adventure alone in it and only groups of level 40 or higher can get deeper inside. The undead frogloks are socially organised as they have a king, preacher and a savant.
</p><p><b>Misty Thicket</b> is a forest outside the town of Rivervale. It is the area that the halflings have staked out to protect their city from the dangers of the Runnyeye goblins to their west.  MT is a newbie and teen zone for Halflings from Rivervale.
</p><p>The ancient walls of the halflings stretch across this zone, cutting it into two distinct halves. The Wall, a safety barrier that divides the zone between the newbie creatures and the teen creatures, is a source of pride and fanatical devotion within Rivervale. The area past the gates and the guards is much more dangerous than the area near the merchant huts and city gates.
</p><p>A strange sight is that of Blixten Entropop, the bug collecting halfling, walking with his pet beetle, Ember.  Ware to the person who threatens little Ember!
</p><p>One can find camps of goblins and orcs here, as well as wasps, wolves, bats, bixies, undead, snakes, bears, giant scarabs, and other creatures.  The froglok bountyhunter Slaythe can sometimes be seen lurking in the trees.
</p><p><b>Nagafen's Lair (Solusek B)</b> 
Nagafen, or formally, Lord Nagafen, is a fiery dragon from the early days of EverQuest whose lair is in the dungeon of Solusek B.  Nagafen's Lair is a large set of caverns that lie deep in the Lavastorm Mountains. Buried deep inside these caves is the lair of the Fire Giants, who are the personal servants of the mighty dragon, Lord Nagafen. The caverns leading to the dragon are infested with all manner of bats and insects, as well as kobolds that have taken up residence in the entrance to them. (EQAtlas)
</p><p>Nagafen has a legion of underlings including fire giants, kobolds, bats, and spiders. Nagafen is a fire dragon and uses a mixture of his voracious claws and fire to defeat his foes. As the game has progressed, the players became more powerful than Nagafen. Now a skilled high-level player could probably kill the dragon all alone if he were not protected by enchantments that would teleport such strong players (above 52) out of his lair once they struck him. 
</p><p><b>Najena</b> is a low-mid level dungeon full of undead, elementals and ogres. Najena is the ancient home of a twisted dark elf magician named Najena, who carved out this hole in the hidden areas of the Lavastorm Mountains in which to carry out her experiments, as well as those of her allies. The ever popular Journeyman Boots originally dropped here as a regular loot item.
</p><p><b>Nedaria's Landing</b> 
This coastal area is located off of Jagged Pine Glades. It consists of forest with rivers and waterfalls and lots of roaming animals and griffawns. There is a huge cliff across the middle of the zone that you can fall over if you are not careful. At the shoreline in the north east corner is a wayfarer camp. 
</p><p><b>Nektulos Forest</b> is the newbie zone for the Dark Elf city of Neriak. A revamped Nektulos was released along with the Depths of Darkhollow expansion, and has since been revamped again in 2006.
</p><p>Nektulos Forest is a dark forest that lies north of the Commonlands on the eastern half of Antonica. It is home to a clan of Leatherfoot Raider halflings, and is also patrolled by the dark elves from nearby Neriak as well as iron guardians.  The area around Neriak is barren and blasted, part of the Lavastorm Mountains beyond it.  The bears, wolves, and undead that prowl the land are very aggressive to travelers.  Young adventurers often find refuge on the huge fallen trees in the forest. (Eq Atlas)
</p><p><b>Neriak</b> consists of Neriak 3rd Gate, Neriak Commons, and the Neriak Foreign Quarter<br /> and is the city of the dark elves, in Nektulos Forest.  Buried in the Lavastorm Mountains, it is a fantasic subterranean city, decorated with neon symbols and artwork. Underground rivers flow through it. The most evil of the races in Norrath can be found here, and their vices have come with them.  Neriak is home to the only house of pleasure in Norrath, where "sporting women" can be found.  The ladies of the night dance on the top of the bar in the "Maiden's Fancy" saloon.  The necromancers’s guild is guarded by ghouls.  Ogres and trolls come here to trade, although there are some brave souls of other races that trade in the foreign quarter.  Neriak is ruled by King Aythox Thex, and Queen Cristianos Thex.(EQ Atlas)
</p><p><b>Northern Desert of Ro</b> was redesigned when Prophecy of Ro was released. The North Ro desert provides newbie to teen level hunting for Freeport characters. The Northern Desert of Ro is a highly trafficked and popular area that marks the southern edge of the human city of Freeport as well as the northern edge of the vast Desert of Ro.  At the northern edge, before the desert begins, there are guards and merchants.  At the edge of the sand, fisherman have set up huts. Dervish cutthroats have set up three camps here, lead by the infamous Dornn B’Dynn, an infamous dark elf.  Sand giants can be found in this area, as well as undead, jackals, and desert terrantulas. (EQAtlas)
</p><p><b>Northern Karana</b>
The Northern Plains of Karana are in the middle of the vast Plains of Karana. Bridges at the east and south pass over the river that on two of its borders.  [Ed note:  Why doesn’t that river have a name?]  Farmers have claimed some of the land here, amidst the dangers of griffons, bears, lions, undead, huge insects, and other monsters.  Gypsies have a caravan at the crossroads.  There is a guardpost of Qeynos guards that try to protect the travelers moving through the area. (EQ Atlas)
</p><p><b>Oasis of Marr</b> This oasis was the original next step for teen characters who graduated from their newbie hunting in North/South Ro. Oasis contains a couple notable landmarks: the Orc Highway (a stretch of desert with a near constant parade of orcs for late teen characters), and the spectre tower (with the mysterious inscription on its summit). For the Kunark expansion, the docks in Oasis found use in shuttling evil characters to the evil outpost in The Overthere. For the Lost Dungeons expansion, Oasis received an entrance to an instanced dungeon. For the Prophecy of Ro expansion, Oasis was combined with the redesigned South Ro.
</p><p>The Oasis of Marr is an oasis in the Desert of Ro.  Here is where the traveler finds the dock for the boat to the outpost of Kunark sails.  There is fresh water here, but an island in the middle has a temple that is surrounded by spectres. Sand giants, crocodiles, undead, snakes and a clan of orcs can all be found in this area.
</p><p><b>Ocean of Tears</b> is a vast ocean between Antonica and Faydwar, home of several small islands. With the recent removal of the boats, few players travel through Ocean of Tears any longer. Trivia: The entire zone is backwards in the east-to-west direction; the continent of Antonica is west of Faydwar, but the Antonica-to-Faydwar boat travels westward, and vice versa.  However, since the boats no longer are functional, this is old school trivia.
</p><p>From the original lore:
The Ocean of Tears is a vast expanse of water that lies between the continents of Antonica and Faydwer. Boats frequently travel between the Butcherblock Mountains and Freeport, taking travellers of all types over the ocean. There are two distinct routes, and each boat only stops at one dock in Ocean of Tears before finishing its journey. 
From Freeport, the boat stops at the island of the Sisters of Ellorosi.
</p><p>From this island, which has a small encampment of dwarves and trouble with pirates, the traveler can swim to the oracle island, where giant Cyclops roam around a tower with a high elven merchant inside.  The next island is home to giant seafury Cyclops, and a pirate encampment.  Further along is a blasted island home to skeletons, gargoyles, and specters.
</p><p>For the master swimmer, the remote island of the colorful aviaks is good for adventure.
</p><p>From Butcherblock, the boat stops at the island of merchant Zachariah Raye.  This boat travels past the island of the fearsome Allizowar.
</p><p>Sirens, water goblins, sharks and other creatures can be found in the ocean.  A number of characters can be found throughout the vast expanse of this sea.
</p><p><b>Oggok</b> is the city of the Ogres.
</p><p>After the dwarven-ogre wars, Barely more then three hundred ogres had survived from a host of thousands and, saying their prays of forgiveness to their god Rallos Zek for loosing the war, the survivors hastily retreated to the south-west. For two weeks the ogres fled and the dwarven forces of king Grimmly hounded them at every step, killing all those they could catch up with. The ogres plundered every small city they came to, even the shattered ruins of the elven capital of Caerthiel where they found ships and supplies they could use. Finally fleeing all the way across the Loping Plains, they set sail across the eastern oceans and away from the closing dwarves. The first Ogre-Dwarven war had officially ended.
</p><p>The ogres, beaten, wounded, and without a leader, reached the then barren continent of Antonica a month after setting sail from Faedwer. Day and night the forces of a once great Rakthokian Kingdom marched tirelessly through the endless desert of Ro and soon to the empty mountain range of what is now known as the serpent's spine. Wanting some time to rebuild and recuperate, the ogres found the mountain's natural geography a good advantage over any invasion force. Here they started the foundations of a new ogre capital, guarded on all sides by two rivers, a desert, a lake, jagged mountains, and a thick jungle, where they could start to assemble again and build a new army for the second ogre-dwarven war. They called their new kingdom "Oggok" which in ogreish means "Revenge." 
</p><p><b>Permafrost</b> is the home of Lady Vox, the ice dragon and formerly one of the highest two dragons in the original game.
</p><p>Permafrost Keep is an ancient ice giant castle that has fallen into ruin, buried in the glaciers that are slowly claiming the northlands. Most of the ancient castle lies in ruins, and what is left consists of rediscovered areas of the old castle and a warren of caves dug out by the goblins who owe fealty to the great dragon Lady Vox. Ice Giants still live here, trapped deep beneath in the cold, waiting in attendance on their master. (EQ Atlas)
</p><p><b>Qeynos Aqueducts</b> is an underground maze of sewer tunnels, a newbie to teen zone for evil Qeynos characters. Also home to the evil factions in Qeynos.
</p><p><b>Qeynos Hills</b> is the local newbie/teen zone for Qeynos and Surefall Glade.
</p><p><b>Qeynos</b><br /> consists of Qeynos North and Qeynos South and is a human city on the west coast of Antonica. Trivia: Qeynos is an anagram of the word SonyEQ.
</p><p>During the Lost Age, a strong and noble band of Humans, lead by Antonius Bayle the First, founded Qeynos under the lofty principles of law. (The History of Norrath, Verant International)
</p><p>Qeynos is one of the largest cities in all of Norrath, and one of the two large coastal cities run by the humans. The docks of the city provide trade from Qeynos to the high human city of Erudin, as well as to other areas along the coast. The Guards of Qeynos command posts throughout the surrounding terrain, providing protection to travellers as far away the the Plains of Karana. Most of the major guilds are present in this town, and it is the home of the Clanhouse of the Silent Fist. There is a seamy underbelly to this city, like other port cities, and rumors of corruption and smuggling as well as unsavory street dwellers are a part of everyday life here. There are many (some say too many) drinking establishments within the high walls of the city. Further from the gates are the Hills of Qeynos, an area jointly patrolled by Guards of Qeynos and the rangers and druids of Surefall Glade. These hills are more dangerous to the traveller, and wild animals roam freely. Haunted ruins dot the landscape, and the hideous entrance to the dark hole of Blackburrow juts out of the cliff face here.
</p><p>The Qeynos Catacombs is the vast ancient water supply to the city of Qeynos. The area was long ago walled off when it was no longer used, but then became the haven of the seedier elements of area, including the beggars and thieves, smugglers and thugs, and up to the members who worship the Plague Bringer himself.  (EQ Atlas)
</p><p><b>Rathe Mountains</b> 
After the War shortly before Depths of Darkhollow Expansion release, the Frogloks were removed from Grobb and now live in a test city in the Western portion of this zone.  Rathe Mountains is a large area of mountains and valleys. It is home to giants, evil druids, undead, wild animals, as well as a race of lizard men. In the Rathe Mountains can also be found a mysterious Sphinx tower guarded by huge scarabs. The trolls have established an outpost here, guarding another location of the mysterious blue flames.
</p><p><b>Rivervale</b> is the home of the Halflings. As a consequence of the buildings being constructed for characters of shorter stature, players of races less vertically challenged may experience some difficulties entering or exiting some of the buildings and facilities of the city. It adjoins the zones of Misty Thicket and Kithicor Forest.
</p><p><b>Runnyeye</b> is the local newbie dungeon for Halflings. It has been revamped once since inception. Runnyeye Citadel is the underground home of the Runnyeye clan of Goblins. Their tunnels wind their way through the hills, carving deeper and deeper down into the depths. There are rumors that the Runnyeye clan of goblins are allied in some strange way with the evil eyes ruled by King Xorbb, working together to expand both of their domains. They also seemed to have tapped into other elemental beings that make their home in this area of Norrath. (EQAtlas)
</p><p><b>Solusek's Eye (Solusek A)</b> is the massive lake of lava in the Lavastorm Mountains.  Solusek's Eye is also the cavernous home of both the fire goblins and their allied clans, and the Solusek Mining Company, an intrepid group of gnomes here for the mineral wealth this area has to offer. Both live in an unsteady alliance with one another in the lava-filled caverns, united by the close presence of their enemies, the Solusek kobolds and Lord Nagafen himself.  (Eq Atlas) This is a mid-level dungeon.
</p><p><b>Southern Desert of Ro</b> is a newbie/teen zone for characters emerging from Innothule Swamp. When Prophecy of Ro was released, this zone was revamped and combined with Oasis of Marr.  The southern edge of the vast and dangerous Desert of Ro. It is the home base for the orcs that have spread northward into the desert proper, and their huts literally cover the grassy region next to the moister Innothule Swamp to the south. One can also find undead spiders, snakes, and giant scarabs, dervish cutthroats and sand giants in this area. An ancient cyclops can sometimes be spotted.
</p><p><b>Southern Karana</b><br />
The Southern Plains of Karana mark the southernmost expanse of the vast Plains of Karana, and lie just north of the Rathe mountain range and the swamplands beyond. They are generally quieter than the other areas of the plains, there are no hill giants or griffons around. Wolves, lions, and elephants roam the plains here, with the occasional centaur hunter in chase. (EQAtlas)
</p><p>South Karana is home to a city of sentient birds, the Aviaks.  The huge wooden tower houses a large number of these warrior birds. One can find the Aviak merchant at the top of the aviak city.  He does not like everyone though, and will give a rude send-off to would be traders if he doesn’t like the look of you.
</p><p><b>Splitpaw Lair (Infected Paw)</b> was originally a newbie dungeon equivalent to Blackburrow.  A bind area was later added to North Karana and the zone revamped to a mid-high dungeon, but it continued to be unused. Again the dungeon was revamped to a ultrahigh level dungeon, but the poor risk/reward ratio means that Splitpaw continues to carry the stigma of a zone that simply can't find an audience.
</p><p><b>Surefall Glade</b> is a haven for the Rangers and Druids of the western coast of Antonica. Nestled in a beautiful waterfell-fed dale filled with the rare large trees of jaggedpine, these lovers of nature, along with the residents of the nearby Qeynos, are at constant battle with destroyers of nature, the worst of which are the nearby Blackburrow Clan of Gnolls.
</p><p>Qeynos Hills lies through a narrow tunnel that connects to the Glade. This area of grassy hills to the north of Qeynos is the main battleground between the humans and half-elves and the gnolls of Blackburrow. The druids and rangers maintain, along with the guards of Qeynos, patrols around the region, although they haven't been enough to curb the tide of gnolls. This area is also teeming with animals that the rangers and druids love, and part of the job of the patrols is to protect those from gnolls and human alike. The Protectors of Jagged Pine and the Qeynos Rangers Guild (QRG) protect the inhabitants.
</p><p>This area has also seen recent problems with undead. Several powerful necromancers have been known to appear in the hills on occasion, bringing with them the undead. Again, these have been fought off at great cost, but the war still continues. (EQAtlas)
</p><p><b>Temple of Solusek Ro</b> is located in the Lavastorm Mountains, and is the site of some quests, including the cleric 1.0 epic.
</p><p><b>The Arena</b> is a huge circular stone building with no roof. The only entrance and exit is a small tunnel that leads to Lake Rathetear. Upon entering the zone, the traveler would then move into a huge cirular area between the outer rock wall and the arena itself. The only entrance into the Arena proper is on the opposite side of the building, to make sure players do not stumble into the actual fighting ground by accident. Moving into the entrance one sees huge stands, and in the center of the grounds is a huge square platform, where the actual fighting will take place. The Arena used to be the main site for many events in the game including online weddings, guild wars, etc. On many occasions there were many events organized by game masters as well. However, the zone is mostly abandoned. As of the time of the release of the Dungeons of Norrath expansion, a portal to the Plane of Knowledge was added, making this zone semi popular again. This zone was updated as part of the release of Prophecy of Ro expansion pack.
</p><p><b>The Caverns of Exile (Solusek C)</b> is originally one of several "pocket zones" (zones which were appended to existing dungeons on a temporary, but as yet continuing, basis).
</p><p><b>The Forgotten Halls</b>
</p><p><b>Upper Guk</b> was originally the local newbie dungeon for Grobb when it was inhabited by trolls, who did not coexist peacefully with the frogloks of Guk. With Grobb (now Gukta) inhabited by their fellow froglok brethren, the frogloks of Upper Guk are no doubt resting more easily.   It is home to one of the most advanced societies, on par with the Kerrans. It is a vast and twisting place, filled with the frogloks and laden with their unique treasures. (EQAtlas)
</p><p><b>West Commonlands</b> is a large open area that is the western continuation of East Commonlands. This area is significantly higher level than East Commonlands, and many of the monsters here are both dangerous and aggressive. 
</p><p><b>Western Karana</b> are on the route from Qeynos area and the west coast of Antonica to the east. There is one major path that dips to the south of the mountain region at the northern edge, connecting Qeynos Hills and the Plains to the east. A river forms the southern boundary of the zone, and mountains the northern boundary. Both areas have people of interest. The north hides a camp of ogres and bandits in the hills.
