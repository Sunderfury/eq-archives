Fan Faire has just begun!<br><br>The community correspondents and the EQ fan site representatives met with the team of SOE designers for the entire day Thursday here in Atlanta to discuss EQ today and what is in store for the future.<br><br>What exciting developments are coming up!  The LiveTeam never ceases to impress with their ideas, so many of which come from the forums and player comments.<br><br>So lets get right to the fun stuff:<br><br>Another Revamp of Nektulos Forest<br>This time it’s actually a good revamp.  Using the very latest in graphics and shader technologies, the SOE team has created Nek Forest as an actual forest this time.  There are no paths; travelers walk on grass between trees.  In a nice touch, you can really see the blades of grass, thanks to the new graphics tools the artists have at their disposal.  The environment is quite realistic and gives the flavor of being in the forest rather than the current Nek of the cardboard trees.  The demo we saw was quite peaceful since it hadn’t been populated yet with all the evil denizens that live near Neriak.  The buildings and structures inside the forest have all be re-worked as well to give a more realistic look with the detail that EQ has been moving toward in the last few months with its environments in the PoR expansion.<br><br>The new Nek Forest should show up sooner than later, I am told, but no date of release yet.<br><br>Growing the Game<br>The development team freely admitted that the lower end game was not up to the new standards, and something needed to be done about it.  They want to make the game more streamlined in general with a clear path to leveling that makes the game interesting for new players as well as returning players.  The dev team said it is hard to tell at times who is a new player from those who are veterans starting over or people on alts getting power leveled, but an effort does need to be made to make sure that new players have good experiences developing their characters and that the high level features can be enjoyed by lower level characters.  To this end, they do plan on making more encounters for 6 people groups, such as the mini-raids introduced recently like the “Flight of the Seeker,” and more fun monster missions such as the Dain missions.<br><br>Grouping will still be a main emphasis in EQ, but the devs recognize there is a need for people to solo and so may introduce more opportunities to solo in the future.  However, they will not be designing solo instances because instances take up so much of the server resources they aren’t a good use of the game mechanic, according to Rashere.  Remember during double experience weekend how instances were buggy?  Imagine one guy crashing your time raid …<br><br>Cross-server groups are not possible at this time, and Rashere mentioned that he wants each server to preserve its unique culture, so they are not working on any system to do cross server instances currently.<br><br>They would like to institute more communication functionality, such as “alias forwarding” so if someone gives you a tell on your main and you are on an alt, it would forward the tell to you (there was a bug discussion of how this would have to be voluntary!),  and to introduce a channel for guild leaders only that would function like guild chat now.  This would eliminate any spamming of, “Stop that chattering in guild chat during the raid!”<br><br>Team Changes<br>Holly “Vahlar” Longdale has been promoted to Assistant Lead Designer.  She’s a very talented designer who puts emphasis on the story and content, which bodes well for the future of the game.  I was pleased to see that a woman was promoted to assistant lead – women designers are still a minority in the gaming industry, but that will probably not be true much longer.<br><br>Jonathan “Prathun” Caracker has taken on the role of spell designer.  Previously he designed and tuned high end raid content, so has an excellent grasp of the high end game and what classes need to succeed.  His experience and knowledge of the dynamics of EverQuest should make him very successful at the task of new spell design and working on the current spell lineup.<br><br>Camile “Zajeer” Abhnor will not be doing itemization much longer, he hopes, but there was no announcement of who will take over the itemization position.  Zajeer was at the summit and clearly knew his stuff while fielding questions from players, so the items are still in good hands until they find his replacement.<br><br>Rashere told me that these kinds of position changes within the live team keep things fresh, ultimately a clear benefit to the players when new ideas come to spell line ups, items, and game design.<br><br>A New Expansion<br>There is a new expansion in the works, but what it will be or what part of the world it will be in.  At the panel, the devs didn’t mention whether there would be a level increase, but it was clear that at some point the level cap would be raised.  Whether or not it will be in this expansion, and how high, remains to be seen. <br><br>There will also be new AAs coming in the future, but the cost of those AAs and how to obtain them was a topic of much discussion in the community summit between the devs and the community reps.  The live team knows how easy it is to get AAs now at level 70, and how much more difficult it is to get them at level 51.  The issues with AAs include how lower levels can be encouraged to work on AA progression, how to keep the system as simple as possible (the points system with AAs, LDoNs, DoNs, and everything else is hard enough to understand), and to make AAs affordable but make them a realisitic reward for time invested but make them somewhat difficult to obtain.  The conclusion, such as it was, was that players would need to work to get the new AAs when they come out, whether by implementing a higher cost for each one, or through another system such as questing.  A good 30 minutes of the afternoon meeting was taken up with a lively discussion between the community reps an the devs about the current system and how things should be handled in the future, and although nothing was decided, you can be assured they all went home with copious notes about how the community felt about it all and ideas from each person.<br><br>The new expansion is more exciting for more than just new AAs.  This expansion will take a player from level one to seventy in the same zone, “with strongly directed content and strong story lines,” Vahlar explained.  She also explained that this time, zones are going to be designed around the content, not content designed around rooms in a zone.  This is a real departure from how things have been done before and an opportunity for the designers to drive the story line forward and make the play experience more coherent and immersive.  I am going to turn up “the fun factor,” Vahlar declared.  She mentioned ideas such as consumable items like pets that would follow you around, and the re-introduction of old items such as jboots and glowing black rings, themed weapons to help in specific areas.  The dev team may also try to introduce the idea of alternate advancement points at lower levels to ease new players into the idea of the complexities of EQ character development.<br><br>This expansion is designed in part to bring back older players that may have left because of the difficulty in catching up with high end players, those lower level players that have a hard time finding groups, and new players that may need more directed play and for anyone that would like to start a new character and follow a story line at every level.  Te plan is that this expansion will come in a box with all the other expansions before it so a person can but just this expansion and play through all the levels.<br><br><br>A New Server<br>I never thought it would happen, but it has.  A new server is in the works (date unknown) to serve a new community of players.  I won’t mention the name C---ic …. but that’s the basic idea.  “This is not our classic server,” as the devs call it, will intricude a play environment that many vocal players have been calling for.<br><br>This new server will be a no transfer, start at level one server that begins with just the Antonican world and will allow player actions to unlock each expansion as time goes by.  As the player community develops this world, the content that was released with each new expansion will come in “small bites”, Producer Chris Lena explained.  That’s right, no frogloks or Vah Shir to start out with.  They have to be discovered.  No boats, but no PoK either until Planes of Power is unlocked.  The old stories of running through Kith forest at night will come alive again, I am sure!<br><br>Players that roll a character on this server will get to experience the history of EverQuest, for the first time or for the second.  All those wonderful old school encounters can be experienced again or as a fresh new experience that many players never had.  One of the lead programmers warned, “you are going to lose some flexibility in features you have been accustomed to … it will be a little bit of the pain you may not have remembered” (or ever experienced!).  I think many folks will cheer “bring it on,” if the posters on the EQ forums speak for more than themselves.<br><br>The dev team and the players had an excellent brain storming session about some of the details of this idea, including corpse altars, quests that include expansions that may not be released, the tutorial, the bazaar, shadowhaven, and bank slots.  The tutorial will have to be modified so the nice gear that drops there now won’t enter this brave new world of cloth armor.    When and how Legacy of Ykesha (LoY) and Lost Dungeons of Norrath (LDoN) could be introduced were also questions that have not yet been answered.  There is much work to be done in the details to make this effort authentic and still retain the fun.  Kudos to the development team for listening to the players, making a world where new players and old can experience what the veterans are always talking about, and giving us all a chance to make some interesting new memories.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 7 Apr, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16474">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16474</a><br>Printed On: Wed Dec 6 22:07:28 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
