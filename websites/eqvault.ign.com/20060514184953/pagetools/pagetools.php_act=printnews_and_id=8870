The Veteran Reward buffs will no longer freeze their timers in the guild hall.<br><br> *** Optimizations *** <br><br>File caching has been enabled which should yield performance improvements, especially on lower end systems when dealing with the UI (opening/closing windows, loading a UI, ...).<br><br> *** Exodus and Related Issues *** <br><br>The exodus bug where a player could possibly die during the small amount of time after the spell is cast but before they actually zone, should now be fixed. We did the best we could trying to reproduce the situations that have been described to us and they have been fixed in our test cases. Please let us know if you continue to experience an issue like this. <br><br>- Spells such as Exodus, have a chance to fail which happens for each person that gets hit by the spell. This means each person has a chance to not get ported. If you fail to get ported, you now receive a message notifying you of the failure. <br><br>- Teleport bind(AA) will no longer leave the caster behind. If the spell is successfully cast, then everyone will be ported. Previously the caster had a 2% chance to not port. <br><br>*** Features Enabled for All *** <br><br>The raid window is now available to all players.<br><br>The LFGroup windows are now available to all players. <br><br>Line-art mapping is now available for all zones. <br><br>*** UI *** <br><br>The Potion Belt will now remain visible after zoning (if it was visible before zoning). <br><br>The advanced display options window has been enhanced substantially. Please note that the Advanced Lighting option is for video cards that support 1.1 Pixel Shaders and above. Also note that the advanced lighting is still being tested with some of our known player hardware configurations. If you experience any issues with it on, please turn it off. Not all hardware combination have been verified to be fully functional. For those that can use it, check out how cool the lighting looks in some of the old zones like the commonlands with the NPCs and their spherical light influences. It looks great. <br><br>The help window has been merged with the petition window. <br><br>*** Misc *** <br><br>You will no longer get experience back from a corpse whose rez timer has expired when using the Veteran AA Expedient Recovery. <br><br>- The level restriction for entering the tutorial has been changed to allow level 10 and under.<br><br> Fixed an old issue with particles. If you had your client running for 10 or so hours, some particle emitters would start to show huge particles. <br><br>*** Chat Channels *** <br><br>There are now system owned, persistent chat channels and players will auto join some of these channels. Players level 20 and under auto join the "NewPlayers" channel, over level 20 auto join "General" and a class specific channel, and there are continent based channels as well. Auto joining channels can be disabled under the options window.<br><br> *** Pet Commands *** <br><br>The "/pet follow" command works properly again. - The "/pet report" command works properly again. <br><br>-- The EverQuest Team </span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 29 June, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8870">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8870</a><br>Printed On: Sun May 14 11:49:53 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
