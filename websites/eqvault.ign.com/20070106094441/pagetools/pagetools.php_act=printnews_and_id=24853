The network, called the Neuronet, will evolve into the world's first public network capable of meeting the data transmission requirements of emerging cinematic and immersive VR technologies. The Neuronet will be used for everything from gaming to entertainment to 'v-business', or virtual business.<br><br>...The first generation Neuronet network is slated to go live in 2007 through the interconnection of regional VR and gaming R&D consortiums being formed under the IAVRT umbrella in metro markets worldwide. Consumer-accessible applications will follow as early as 2009. <br><br>...Neuronet domains are not compatible with the Internet, nor will Internet domains be compatible with the Neuronet. The Internet was not designed to support the data transmission requirements of real-time VR data so the Neuronet is being created as a separate and distinct network."<br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 29 Dec, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24853">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24853</a><br>Printed On: Sat Jan 6 1:44:41 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
