THE crash? hard to say. But a crash for sure, reproducible (now that I know the missing factor) and fixed. It will go out on the next live patch. I can tell you without a doubt it was responsible for the core dumps that I could make heads/tails of, but as for the semi-corrupt ones? Good chance, not great.. but good.<br><br>No I don't know when the next live patch will be, and I'm not authorized to speculate, but I can assure you it will be soon.<br><br>No I'm not going to tell you the details, except what everyone already knows; its related to charm and death. I'm sorry, I truly am, for the honest guilds and raid leaders who would use the info correctly, but if I post "don't do this" I might as well code in a button that just crashes the zone when you press it."<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 16 Nov, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23418">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23418</a><br>Printed On: Thu Dec 7 2:03:17 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
