One of the more interesting from quotes from Rashere involves some future game features:<br><br>"We have several zone revamps in the pipeline right now, the first of which will be coming out with the patch next week. In addition, there are a bevy of holiday events heading your way and the new year will bring some surprising changes to the world of Norrath, but you'll have to wait and see for those."<br><br>Sounds intriguing!<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 1 Dec, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23935">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23935</a><br>Printed On: Thu Dec 7 2:07:08 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
