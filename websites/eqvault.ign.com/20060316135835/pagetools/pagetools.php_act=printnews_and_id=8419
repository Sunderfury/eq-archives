So here are a few little tidbits from Kwill’s quill….<br><br>No one at all wanted to hear the necro representative in the community summit ask for more stuff for his class.  Really, they didn’t.  When all your dots and poisons run out, too bad for you.  You can’t have more nukes.  Go play with dead things.<br><br>There was a Curt Schilling sighting, but it wasn’t by me.  I managed to miss him the entire time by not being at the right place at the right time.  My loyal correspondent Pakse hid the baseball either he brought or someone was giving him, though.  If you don’t know who he is, get out of the basement more (or at least turn on the TV when your raid wipes).  Apparently he showed up and couldn’t wait to log on in the media room and play.<br><br>The Antonia Bayle costume, while quite lovely, has nothing underneath the cape covering Antonia’s derriere (the bottom part is a sort of thong), which can cause some serious issues when picture posing.  Hands outside the cape please!  Step away from the keyboard if this excited you too much.<br><br>And for those in the know, the costume is a size 4.   That means I only heard about the thong and didn’t experience wearing it due to the fact that I would have to have one about ten times bigger.  Yes, I have spared the EQ community from mental trauma by not modeling it. <br><br>Although many beautiful women came and had their picture taken for the model search for Antonia, all the gamer girls agreed that the winner should be a player, not just a model.  I concur.  But she still has to fit into the costume, which as I just mentioned is a size 4.<br><br>A certain class representative got a little lucky in Vegas and won $7500 at blackjack.  Wow!  I won 55 cents at the nickel video poker.  Pwned.<br><br>Your loyal correspondent managed to wander in a room that she wasn’t supposed to and saw a sneak peak of something before anyone else did.  But I remained mute and no one ever knew!   Wild drolvargs couldn’t drag it out of me.  You’re welcome.<br><br>The rogue rep kept backstabbing people with yellow post it notes.  It was even more fun to tell people they had a postit on their back they hadn’t noticed.<br><br>There will never be an end to the debate on wizard/rogue DPS.  The official words are “working as intended.”  You guys just will have to continue believing what you want.<br><br>You are not a casual player if you are level 70 and have 500 AA.  Nope.  No.   I’m not listening …<br><br>The Spike TV guys were as hip as they should have been.  Finally, the recognition we have all been craving.<br><br>Color is not your enemy, people.  Why do all EQ players like black so much?!  It’s like a sea of black and grey in the exhibit hall.  We need Queer Eye for the Gamer Guy.  That’s if we can drag you out of the “Ultimate Gamer Chair” which appeared to be ready to turn players into pod people.  <br><br>Brell server people, you really should show up at your server table at the banquet.  The Cazic People took a picture of your empty table and laughed.<br><br>If there is going to be a geography contest as to who traveled the farthest to Fan Faire, then probably it should be clear which is father, China or Australia.  Clue: it’s not China.<br><br>Getting as naked as possible in the costume contest seemed to work pretty well on the judges’ decision making apparatus.  However, since a dwarf lady with a beard also won, I can’t really claim bias, can I?<br><br>Just because you meet an elegantly attired professional looking lady in the elevator do not assume she’s someone attending one of the educational conferences also being held at the hotel.   Turns out she was completely hip wizard board rep. Oops. <br><br>When giving an example of a bad player, don’t name someone from your server when unbeknownst to you someone else from your server is sitting at the table two people away from you.  Because they will point this embarrassing gaffe out to everyone.<br><br>Having a contest where it’s required that people run to the back of a huge banquet hall to get somewhere first is going to get you a spot on the State Farm insurance commercial series, you know, the ones where the serious guy intones about some insane accident with a barbecued turkey.  Or a role playing gamer trampled by other role playing gamers trying to sign up first.<br><br>Finding a hacker in your network, tracking that person down and then sending the obscene pictures he posted to your site over his open printer port while his mom is on the phone learning about his nefarious deeds deserves ultimate snaps.  Wish I had thought of that.<br><br>If you quit one game to play another one, don’t sit with the ex-game’s devs for breakfast because they will ask you why you quit and you won’t get to eat your bacon because you will be trying to figure out what to say.<br><br>Try to remember that items from EQ2 are not the same as EQ1.   I spent precious moments of my life trying to understand what was so important about farming items for a screaming mace until I figured out it was an EQ2 item that actually meant something in the game.<br><br>All in all, good fun had by everyone at the Fan Faire!  Thanks for making it ubah!!</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 13 June, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8419">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8419</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:58:35 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
