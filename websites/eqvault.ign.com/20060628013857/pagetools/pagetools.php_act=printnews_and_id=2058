When laying out zones it can be easy to fall into a “balanced approach” where you have equal number of zones for all level ranges. Or, even have more zones available for lower level players over high level ones. This makes perfect sense at the inception and early running of a massively multiplayer game like EQOA, but as the game matures, more and more players will have higher level characters.</blockquote><br>Check out the full article right <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Features.Detail&id=34&category_select_id=6">here</a>.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 29 September, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=2058">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=2058</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 27 18:38:57 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
