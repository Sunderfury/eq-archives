Workshop<br>(Somewhat Hazardous Industrial Prototype Workshop) <br><br>Designed by Meldrath and built by his minions, the tower was designed to be used as an experimental laboratory where somewhat hazardous experimental research is carried out. The tower was built away from Mechanotus as a preventative measure... Damaged inflicted during an experiment gone awry has left the tower somewhat immobile, and it is now towed with a large linked chain attached to Mechanotus. <br><br>The tower itself is designed so that dangerous portions are kept away from the central tower in the experimental pods. The zone is overseen by Head Administrative Grigano. Each of the pod rooms is somewhat autonomous, and under the supervision of a head scientist / researcher. The purpose of the tower is to conduct experiments, and produce new technology, although for some reason the tower never seems to produce much more than the occasional ill-fated explosion. <br>   <br>Steam Factory<br><br>Unseen beneath the Fortress Mechanotus lies a vast network of tunnels, mines, and caverns. These tunnels are the heart of Meldrath's operations. Mines, living quarters, and manufacturing plants could all be found being worked to capacity. As with the fortress, no one outside knew of the tunnels even with several of them extending beneath land the gnomes of Ak'Anon were quite familiar with. It wasn't until the fortress rose into the air that this vast network was revealed. <br><br>The majority of the tunnels were left behind when the fortress lifted off. Many of the tunnels left behind collapsed, crushing those unfortunate enough to have been left there. Taken with the fortress were rooms central to the operation of the fortress and Meldrath's mansion. Several power stations to keep the fortress aloft along with the primary manufacturing facility and foundry were all left in good repair. These together with the limited mining under the flying fortress allow Meldrath to continue his operations and attacks on Ak'Anon. <br><br>The Steam Factory is filled with Meldrath's minions. Gnomes supporting Meldrath are in charge of operations in the tunnels. They are tasked with keeping things running at levels meeting Meldrath's expectations. Steamworks can be found in all areas of the tunnels, helping with manufacturing, mining, or guard patrols. Minotaurs provide slave handling and brute labor. The brownies of the tunnels receive the dubious honor of being the lowest on the chain of command and receive the most hazardous duties. However, a small group of the brownies have broken away from working for Meldrath and are working day and night to thwart the operations of the Steam Factory and the entire fortress.  </span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 10 Sep, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32880">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32880</a><br>Printed On: Sun Oct 7 6:11:06 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
