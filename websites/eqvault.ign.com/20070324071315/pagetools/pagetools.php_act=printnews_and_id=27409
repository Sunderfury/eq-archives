EQ developers, SOE representatives, class correspondents, etc. Hate to break it to some of you, but you, the individual reading this, do not matter in the grand scheme of things. Yes, the playerbase as a whole matters, obviously, but unfortunately we, the playerbase, are not all of the same consciousness. So pay attention because you're already fighting an uphill battle to bring attention to your issue. We have to compete for the developer's time. They are busy working on the game, after all.<br><br>So, I give you the top four easiest, quickest ways to lose that battle before it even gets started by getting ignored completely by a VIP:<br>_____________________________________________<br><br>1. Gross exaggerations.<br><br>"...nerf everything..." "...nothing works..." "...everything is broken..." "...unplayable..." "...doomed..." "...dying...", etc.<br><br>Exaggerating is a very common way to make a point sound more solid and viable. Unfortunately, it often has the opposite effect. While it may seem that way to you, it more often than not simply isn't true, and definitely isn't true to all people. Most of the time the only evidence you have is circumstancial, and sometimes even worse: hearsay. Neither of which leads to any kind of insightful posture or to any kind of fix.<br><br>The antithesis to this is providing all of the detailed data you can to make your point and let the reader determine for themselves how big of an issue it is. Incidentally, threads that are full of factful data will get much more notice by the VIP.<br>_____________________________________________<br><br>2. Insults.<br><br>"...the devs lied about..." "...sony lied about..." "...greedy...", etc.<br><br>This is otherwise called biting the hand that feeds you.<br><br>Yes, you're right, I'm well aware that you are a paying customer. Unfortunately, that does not mean you own the world and everything in it. The reality is that you are only one of hundreds of thousands of paying customers, all with their own priorities and wishes and demands.<br><br>When SOE appears to change their stance on something, it is almost certainly due to one or more of the following:<br>a. They were convinced to do so by other paying customers who may not agree with you.<br>b. You misunderstood.<br>c. It's simply a bug (thus not intended) and will be fixed.<br><br>If you feel frustrated enough to want to insult a developer, the best course of action is to take deep breaths, counting slowly to 10, and post nothing. As in #1, take a calm approach. Post what you thought you understood, what you know now, and let the reader decide how big of an issue it is.<br>_____________________________________________<br><br>3. Ambiguity.<br><br>"That one thing by the place in that area by the thing...is broken."<br><br>There are levels of ambiguity. Some is unavoidable since you may not be able to get as much information as you'd like. But doing your due dilligence in getting as much information as you can will go a long way to giving something for the board members and dev team to chew on. If you get the ball rolling, maybe other players can fill in the missing details, but otherwise it is a waste of space to post about what you don't know (unless, of course, you're asking a question).<br>_____________________________________________<br><br>4. Overreacting/overdemanding.<br><br>"...SOE better fix this NOW or else..."<br><br>Usually, overreactions are littered with #1s, #2s, and #3s.<br><br>So the devs decided to nerf your 'soloing raid mobs' class, or your favorite 'gain 12 AA per hour' hunting spot, or your 'instant-cast no-recast timer' effect on your favorite clicky. (Notice the exaggerations in the previous sentence.) And now, you can't even solo blue con mobs, it takes weeks to level, or the effect on your clicky makes it completely useless. (Isn't this fun?)<br><br>Bottom line: suck it up. At some point or another, every single player has had at least one "favorite" nerfed, and it will continue to happen. SOE has made every effort to prevent having to do so, but in a world as large and complex as Norrath, stuff slips through the cracks (including player's avatars, sometimes...). And many times, devs will be the ones to overreact and may, in fact, go too far.<br><br>But that is no reason to raise a call to arms. Chances are, the dev team already *knows* they went too far with their nerf or enhancement. And if they don't know, they're counting on you to snoop out the details and provide them data that they can use to tune balance more finely. It is hard to wade through harsh demands, exaggerations, ambiguity and insults to determine that, for one, there really is an issue, and for another, what they need to do to fix it.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 14 Mar, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27409">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27409</a><br>Printed On: Sat Mar 24 0:13:15 PDT 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
