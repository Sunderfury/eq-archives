We will have to fix the problem, make sure that other similar things are not broken then go through the Game Update process again.  This includes rebuilding the code, pushing it out to all servers then running through the smoke test again.  So, realistically we are looking at extending the estimated uptime another 3 hours or so.  That would be 12:00pm PDT (3:00pm EST, 7:00pm UTC).<br> <br>I apologize for the inconvenience. </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 5 October, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21822">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21822</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:02:50 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
