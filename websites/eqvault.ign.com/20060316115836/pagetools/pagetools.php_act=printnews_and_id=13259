The letter states that it has not been decided whether Stormhammer will become a regular server or players will be moved to other existing servers.  The letter states the decision will be partly up to the community.  A poll will be posted shortly in game that will allow subscribers to choose whether Stormhammer will be shut down or kept as a regular server.<br><br>Stormhammer has been floundering for population for quite some time now.  This decision will probably come as no surprise to the players who subscribe to the premium service, which promised more GM attention and more events on the server for a higher subscription fee.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 7 December, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13259">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13259</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 3:58:36 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
