I hope to add an article each week, if not more often.  I welcome ideas, so send them in.<br><br>This first essay talks about the difference between thinking ahead and planning ahead to achieve your in-game goals.  I hope it's helpful and thought-provoking.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 15 November, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12732">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=12732</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:05:13 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
