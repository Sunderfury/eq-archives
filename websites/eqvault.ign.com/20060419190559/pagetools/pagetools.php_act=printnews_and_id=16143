The problem is I moved him further away from the named orc raid because it was causing some funky agro problems having a quest giver be so close to.  <br><br>If you get stuck on this until the next time we can update tasks to the live servers, you can get the update if you go to location positive 1603, negative 1435.  Then run over to Orgaf who isn't to far away from that spot. <br><br><br>-Gordish the Gnomish Hero"</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 27 March, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16143">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16143</a><br>Printed On: Wed Apr 19 12:05:59 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
