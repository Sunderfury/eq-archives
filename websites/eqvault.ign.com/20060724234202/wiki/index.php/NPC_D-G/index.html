						<p><b>Da Bashers</b><br />
Da Bashers are a warrior guild in Grobb, the ogre city, lead by Ranjor.  Da Bashers are rivals of the Broken Skull Clan.
</p><p><b>Dabner Drednever</b><br />
Dabner Drednever is a cleric of Brell Serilis. He is a compassionate and simple man, light of heart and jovial in spirit. He does not share the intelligence of his close friend Ognit, nor the physical strength of his sworn protector, the barbarian woman Dagda. He is generally an air-head but this is off-set with a natural wisdom that shows itself in the form of the occasionally profound and significant insight. He is most comfortable in a nice cavern with some good solid earth over his head. As fate would have it, this is seldom possible. He takes this in great stride though. As long as he is with his friends, his inherent agoraphobic, gnomish nature usually does not bother him. 
</p><p>Dabner views Ognit as a role model. He wants to be more like Ognit but realizes that he lacks the intense schooling that Ognit has had. Indeed, he knows he is too old to pursue those things and he also knows that he lacks the mental acuity that Ognit possesses. He is comfortable in that knowledge, however. Dabner is the stereotypical side-kick to Ognit. He marvels at his ability to channel great magical energies in a most efficient manner (Ognit speaks often of efficiency). He will go along with just about anything that Ognit does and he trusts his judgement implicitly.
</p><p>Dabner has convinced Ognit to show him a bit of tinkering. The reason for this is both a means for him to be more like his role model Ognit, and also as a way to impress Dagda, upon whom he has a crush. Dabner is taken by Dagda's raw strength and physical prowess. She is his Knight in Shining Armor, in a manner of speaking. A word of encouragement from her ignites a spark within him that sets him aflame with unparalleled courage. Yet as much as he loves her, his nature prevents him from making even the slightest sort of statement of desire towards Dagda.
</p><p>In an odd way, a way that he does not acknowledge in a conscious manner, he views himself as solely responsible for the welfare of his companions. He has occasionally brought down the wrath of Brell upon a foe in order to call its attention upon him and to draw the enemy away from its target. This fact has garnered him great respect with Dagda and she does view the small gnome as one who is surprisingly brave for his size.
</p><p>Though Dabner is completely devoted to the worship of Brell, he also has studied, and is quite knowledgeable about, the religions of other cultures in Norrath, as well as the lore of the gods they worship. He finds that by studying and understanding the beliefs of others, they are not as scary to him.
</p><p><b>Dag the Blaspheme</b><br />
An evil sorcerer, he forged an enchanted blade that became cursed.
</p><p><i>From the Forbidden Scribe in West Cabilis</i>
</p><p>Long ago in the time of Emperor Ganak, Scholar Dag did walk with the Great Master Atrebe. After the unfortunate dusting of Atrebe did Dag begin his Study of the forbidden circles, Wizardry, Enchantry and Magic. It was soon that he took a liking to the ways of Wizardry.
</p><p>His studies were kept to himself as he ignored the laws of Kotiz. He became the Blasphemere of the Brood. Most of his studies were held in private, only his Sarnak slave named Kly was allowed to assist in his blasphemous studies. His secret was soon to be revealed to all.
</p><p>Dag was commissioned by Klum Machata to create a magical dagger for his personal use. It was to only be wielded by one of his ilk. Dag travelled to Kum’s outpost to begin his work. His slave went along, pulling behind him a special forge which belonged to Haggle Baron Dalnir.
</p><p>While Dag was away the Brood stumbled upon his journal and his secret obsession. The Brood sent word to Kum to have Dag deconstructed.
</p><p>Dag was in the final stage of enchantments, Kum let him proceed and when the dagger was complete, Kum shackled Dag and used the dagger upon the belly of Dag, the Blasphemere. 
The Dagger was found to be very effective, but lacked a few more spells and so it was returned to the Brood. It never made it back. The Crusaders sent, as well as the Sarnak slave who was pulling the Dalnir Forge, all vanished without a trace. Only the Dalnir Forge remained.
</p><p>Surely the gods cursed the blade by the hands of the Blasphemere. To avoid the wrath of the gods, all of Dag’s property and creations were burned as was the memory of his blasphemous studies.

</p><p><b>Dagda Icefury</b><br />
A barbarian warrior hero of Norrath.
</p><p>Dagda is a strong woman, firmly rooted in the physical world. She is most comfortable dealing with things she can touch, hear, and smell. A follower of The Tribunal, she believes in the tenants of absolute justice, but, for the most part, has little use for the gods. The realms of spirit and magic are best left to those who have the time to worry about such intangible things. The extent of her mystical experiences consist of a single dream she received from Tunare, though she never knew nor cared about its source, that foretold her meeting the gnomes, Ognit and Dabner. Other than this, she has found that obstacles are best met head-on where she can see them face to face, smell their breath, and hear the crunch of their bones. 
</p><p>Dagda saved the gnomes Ognit and Dabner in Everfrost many years ago when raiders attacked them. She has grown very fond of, and indeed loves, them both. She respects them for their inherent mystical and spiritual abilities, but she is keenly aware of their physical frailties. She vowed to defend them both, and does so with the ferocity of a bear defending her cubs.
</p><p>Dagda is by no means simple, and is truly a genius in the realm of tactics and combat. She is literate enough to read the common tongue with little difficulty, and speaks both the common tongue and her native tongue fluently. Her knowledge of other languages is generally limited to curses and taunts, of which she has gathered quite an arsenal. She generally communicates in a short and very direct fashion, leaving no room for misinterpretations.
</p><p>Dagda knows that Ognit is very intelligent and respects his knowledge, though she sometimes questions its use. She is most impressed and thoroughly fascinated by his ability to tinker and create wondrous things. Indeed, this is the medium through which she can relate to him best. The useful objects he builds allow her to perform any number of tasks, so useful, in fact, that she thinks he would be better off giving up the study of wizardry to become a full-time tinker. After all, it's just fine to call down the very fire of Fennin Ro upon the mighty Glacier Bear at 300 yards, but when it is mauling your head off it's of little use. 
</p><p>Dagda shares a healthy sibling-like rivalry with Ognit. Being an accomplished tactician, she is aware of the simple fact that at a distance Ognit would have the clear advantage, and would win were they to ever do battle. However, she also knows that if she got her hands upon him, she would be the victor. Despite being quick to anger at times--and she and Ognit have often exchanged heated words--Dagda would never raise a hand against either of the gnomes she has sworn to protect.
</p><p>Dagda views Dabner in a much different light. She has on countless occasions felt his healing touch as a cleric. For one who is so firmly rooted in the physical world, he is a very compassionate and loving soul. She loves him as a brother, and treats him in a somewhat patronizing manner. She would never consider speaking an unkind word to him, nor will she tolerate those that might. She is aware of, and also a bit saddened by, a crush Dabner has upon her. Dabner is simply too short for her tastes. She would much prefer a man of might with whom she would not worry. However, as a warrior she respects his raw courage in battle and his unfailing loyalty to his friends.
</p><p>Though she is closest to the gnomes, Dagda also shares a strong respect for her companions. It is Firiona Vie, Sir Jevik, and Thubr Axebringer she most deeply admires. They are all mighty warriors in her eyes. She acknowledges the skills of the rogue Dreezil Pocketdip, and views him as a skilled fighter. His ways of stealth are an effective way of dealing with his natural halfling handicaps in her eyes. Though she is not a warrior and not as skilled as the others with a sword, the bard Sionachie is a valuable asset to the group. Her rousing battle songs inspire a zeal that makes combat that much more exciting.
</p><p>For the wizard Al'Kabor, Dagda has little love. Respecting the immense power he wields, she has a healthy fear of him. After his recent threats against Ognit, however, her opinion of him has since plummeted.
</p><p><b>Dain Frostreaver IV</b><br />
The King of the Coldain Dwarves
</p><p><b>Dagnor</b><br />
Ogre and Warlord, known as the destroyer of the five kingdoms.
</p><p><i>Of the Rakthokian Kingdom and General Dagnor:</i><br /> 
For centuries while the elven empire grew to the east, the dwarves and ogres had thrived in the mountains to the west, surrounding the forest presently known as "Lesser Faydark." The dwarves settled into the jagged cliffs of what is known as the Butcherblock Mountains and there had established their golden kingdom of Kaladim, "The Forge of Norrath."
</p><p>The ogres were able to wrestle control of nearby lands from the orcan hordes of Faedwer after a decade of warfare and established the first ogreian kingdom in the nearby Rakthokian ridge mountain range, named after the first ogre leader "Rakthok the Warlord." There in the Faydark west the dwarves and ogres lived in an uneasy peace.
</p><p>While the immense empire of the elves could have easily crushed either one of the kingdoms, the ogres saw the dwarves as a primary concern. Raised in a culture where only the strength in your arms and the size of your weapon mattered, the ogres of the kingdom of Rakthok considered only the dwarves to be their equal and thus a very large threat. The ogres were also greedy of the gold-rich mountain mines and the stone cutting skill of the Kaladim kingdom, and to make matters worse, the friendly disposition of the dwarves did not agree with the savage and chaotic tendencies of the Rakthokian ogres. What resulted was an intense racial hatred and many small fights between the two kingdoms. 
</p><p>In the beginning of the second age, when the elven rebels against the god Innoruk began to surface, Dagnor the Butcher was chosen as the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian Kingdom. Clearly the most ambitious of all the previous Rakthokian kings, Dagnor was the first to realize that the small skurmishes between dwarves and ogres would never solve anything and that for the ogres to gain anything substantial, the dwarves would have to be completely overcome or slaughtered. He saw the mines of Kaladim as an infinite source of limitless wealth and power. Almost immediately after he seized the throne Dagnor began to assemble the largest combined army of ogres since the orcan clans had been overthrown.
</p><p>Dagnor was held in check for a long time, however, because Kaladim was a chief source of gold and weapons for the elven empire and the dwarves would find the elves a strong ally if war broke out. The ogre king was smart enough to realize that his kingdom could not survive an attack from both sides and so he did not advance and the dwarves did not regard him as much of a threat. While the indomitable elven empire loomed over western Faedwer, war was not an option for either the dwarves or the ogres. 
</p><p><i>Of the attacks on Northern Kaladim:</i><br /> 
Dagnor is sometimes referred to as the destroyer of two empires. When he began his campaign against the dwarven kingdom of Kaladim he began the fall of his own kingdom of Rakthok, but also he stopped the dwarves from giving aid to the elven empire against the ever increasing elven rebel armies. Many historians surmise that if the dwarves had not been pulled into war with the ogres, their help would have caused the downfall of the rebel army and the old elven empire would still be in existence.
</p><p>In any case, with the war of the broken crown raging to the east, Dagnor knew the elves could not afford to lend aid to the dwarves and he took the opportunity to launch his own campaign against the kingdom of Kaladim. The warlord knew that the key to beating the dwarves was through the less guarded lands of northern area Kaladim where the dwarves had primarily established trading centers and peaceful mining villages. So in the middle of the second age, the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian kingdom marched his army of ogres and orcan slaves west across the hills of shade directly to northern Kaladim without fear of elven intervention.
</p><p>Old dwarves still tell the horrible tales of the first ogre attacks. Ill prepared to meet such an invasion force, the peaceful cities of northern Kaladim were swept over with tremendous speed. Ogre warriors burned everything they could put a torch to and killed every dwarf they saw be it man, woman, or child. In little less then a week the forces of Dagnor had surprised Kaladim and caused the deaths of hundreds of dwarves. The warlord had found the weakness in the impenetrable kingdom of Kaladim and now marched directly for the capital.
</p><p><i>Of King Grimmly Fireforge, and the Battle on the Hills of Shade:</i><br />
It was Dagnor's unnecessary need to stop and make sure everything was dead in the wake of his army that gave the time the dwarves needed to prepare. Word reached the capital city of Kaladim days before the ogres arrived. Hearing the startling news of the advancing army, the 12th dwarven King Grimmly Fireforge, an excellent fighter and brilliant military tactician, began to assemble a defensive force. Dagnor also did not anticipate the speed by which the dwarves could gather into a force large enough to repel his own. It was the warlord's first mistake.
</p><p>When the army of ogres reached the Crakthorn ridge, just one mile from the capital city of Kaladim, they were met by an equally large force of dwarves lead by King Grimmly. The fighting on the ridge was savage and brutal, but being less skilled at fighting in tight tunnels and with low light then the dwarves, the ogres were forced to flee. Dagnor ordered his army into the hills of shade where the dwarves and ogres could fight on equal ground.
</p><p>Day and night the battle raged across the hills of shade above the Lesser Faydark and the grass was bleached red with the blood of the fallen. Both armies were fueled by soldiers from their respective kingdoms and soon the war had ground into a stalemate
</p><p><i>Of the Orcan Betrayal and the Battle of the Shattered Spear:</i><br /> 
Thinking that the war would either be won or lost on the hills of shade, Dagnor ordered his southern most forces guarding the forest of lesser Faydark to move north and add more strength to the army in the hills. He left instead a handful of ogre soldiers and mostly a host of orcan slaves. It was Dagnor's second and most fatal mistake.
</p><p>For the first time in history dwarves and orcs came to an agreement and entered in on an alliance. The dwarves promised the orcan slaves of the defeated orcan clans their freedom if they would not interfere in the war in favor of both sides. Completely in favor with the plan, which gave the orcs freedom but did not require them to fight, the orcan slaves retreated from lesser faydark to the east, deserting the armies of Dagnor and leaving the southern hills wide open. King Grimmly took this opportunity to assemble a second force to the south and then attacked Dagnor's army from both the front and the undefended flank. The ogre forces on the hills of shade were demolished. Dagnor fled with few others and the Rakthokian kingdom was now completely vulnerable. Grimmly gathered his remaining forces and headed straight for the ogre capital, leveling any fortresses he came to and burning Rakthok to the ground. The Rakthokian army had been broken.
</p><p>The last official battle took place beneath the forest of lesser Faydark as the remaining ogre forces, lead by Dagnor, attempted to flee to the south. They were met there by a small force of vengeful dwarven soldiers who were able to hold them off until the arrival of the main dwarven host. When King Grimmly and his army arrived, the forces of Dagnor fought viciously and were able to kill many, but were ultimately defeated. A story tells that Grimmly and Dagnor met eachother face to face on the shores of a lake to the south of lesser faydark during one of these fights, and that Grimmly stabbed Dagnor with a spear with such intensity and ferociousness that the weapon shattered into thousands of pieces even as it cut straight through the ogre lord's chest. The story goes on to say that the warlord fell to his death immediately in that same lake and that the evil in his blood made the water boil and turn red. Thus the dwarves mockingly renamed the lake Dagnor's Cauldron and thus the final battle of the ogre-dwarven war was called "the battle of the shattered spear."

</p><p><b>Dartain the Heretic</b><br />
An ancient Erudite heretic, he was imprisoned in Paneel, but managed to escape. 
</p><p><i>From a letter from Al`Kabor, Master of the Arcane to Earron Huntlan:</i><br />
After many grueling hours of attempting to restore the ruined page of the diary that you did give to me for research, I was unable to return the penmanship to a more legible standard or to interpret the writing to any large degree. As unfortunate that may be, I was however able to brush away most of the fluids that stained the page to see a quite remarkable and rather curious symbol stained into the parchment itself. I furthered my studies in regards to the symbol and found that it was an ancient Rune that has since fallen beneath the ways of our modern magical practices. 
</p><p>Despite the Rune's disappearance from our arcane methods, I myself was still able to translate the Rune and find exactly its purpose if used within a spell or research. This Rune in particular dates back to the Heretic Revolt and the forming of the first Paineel, which I am sure you know has since fallen into rubble beneath the hands of Master Yael. I have had brief introductions to ancient lore in the evolution of our magic and after some further research, I was able to pinpoint the exact creation and original purpose of this rune's creation. 
</p><p>One known as Dartain created the rune. An ancient Heretic who should be nothing more than dust within his grave, he somehow remains alive and well. His time shall soon come, but that is not the tale that we are discussing. Dartain created this rune and two others that would assist him in one of his many studies and experiments with death and life in attempts to create a spell that would summon a rather powerful undead servant. The project fell away as the Necromancer found an easier way to forge the spell, which to this day is used by those Necromancers who have the power within them to conjure such a powerful Servant of Bones. Due to this research, I am quite determined to think that the diary itself is one of the many that Dartain did keep before his exile to the Plane of Underfoot.
</p><p>With the Runes no longer able to assist Dartain's research, he returned them to the pages of his diary where he is famed for holding most of his meaningless ramblings. If the diary were to be recovered one would notice that there are failed attempts to inscribe these runes upon pages 19, 23, 29, and 37 of the diary. It is rumored that if these runes are combined with the words of the same context, a flawless incantation would be created and thus the effect which Dartain was striving to obtain with his original creation of the Runes. Due to the more powerful nature of these incantations, I would assume the effect to be on a larger scale than that of a simple pet. I would have liked to take a look at the diary in full to perhaps find the other Runes and further my study. 
</p><p>Despite the absence of the other runes, I was able to discover the names of three inscribed upon the pages of that ancient diary... The first Rune that was created was that of Servility; the second Rune, the one that I held for some time in my possession, is that of Entreaty; and the third and final rune is that of Dominion. For each of these Runes there are a set of words that compliments the meaning and purpose of the Rune's names, unfortunately I can not provide the exact names of these words as they were a well kept secret from the likes of "goodly" scholars. 
</p><p>How this could possibly relate to the problems you have observed within your tavern and city are beyond me. This diary is meaningless as a whole and the runes inscribed upon these ancient illegible pages are useless without the words, which have been lost for centuries. With what has been evident within these past few days in regards to these disturbances, we can clearly eliminate the possibility of the heretic's involvement. This display is much too sloppy for their style in oppression, and they are currently too tied up with the Council at Erudin to attempt to control such a city as this. 
</p><p>There is one thing, however, that has disturbed me and has led me to believe that your thoughts of conspiracy are correct, but I still do not know what the diary or the runes have to do with any of this outbreak of petty street crimes. Last night as I was preparing myself to retire for the evening, a rather polite knock came to my door. To my surprise, an elderly erudite, as you had described to me when pleading for my assistance with the diary page, appeared at my door asking for the diary page to be returned to him. Immediately, as instinct would have, I dismissed him without the object of his desire and he turned away without another word. When I awoke this morn I found that the page was no longer in my possession, which leads me to think that it has some importance to this man. Never the less, I shall handle the situation on my own, if of course he has not retreated back into Paineel.

</p><p><b>Dreezil Stickens Pocketdip</b><br />
An honest halfling rogue, Dreezil has many adventures with Firiona Vie.
</p><p>How Dreezil Came to Meet Firiona Vie
Dreezil was the smallest of his family; the "runt of the litter," his father Wurrin called him. He was such a cute infant, he was cuddled and carried constantly by his mother Teezil and his seven older sisters. It kept him from learning to walk until he was nearly ready for schooling. Spending so many years neglecting his lower extremities, however, didn't keep him from becoming very clever with his hands. The halfling tyke was nearly five turns old before his family associated the occasional missing earring or disappearing locket with bouncing Dreezil on their knees. Yes, Dreezil was a natural, all right, a born rogue.
</p><p>The Deeppockets took Dreezil under their collective wing shortly after his mischief was discovered. Rarely was such talent inborn, normally it took years of practice with the dip dummy, with its bells all over its suit to warn of sloppy work by students. Slipping fingers into a pocket, or "dipping," had to be done smoothly, in a single, fluid motion that wouldn't disturb a flea. The ringing of a bell on the dip dummy indicated clumsy or inattentive technique. But Dreezil never rang a bell once in all his training. It almost seemed as if his hand turned to smoke when he slipped it into a pocket or beltpurse, or the treasures inside leaped into his hands of their own accord. Dreezil was the best the Deeppockets had ever seen in all their years in Rivervale.
</p><p>Rogue schooling didn't end at pocket picking, however. In fact, once a student had spent a few weeks in training, they would arrive one morning to find the doors locked to them! No one would answer their knocks. They had to figure out some other way to get into the Fool's Gold, and they didn't dare be late to class! Dreezil was undaunted when his time came. He pulled out a fishhook he'd stuck into his cap brim and carefully bent it straight. Sticking the fishhook into the lock opening, it took him only a moment to flip the lock, which opened with a satisfying snick. Dreezil never batted an eye, arriving in class early as usual. His instructors looked sidewise at one another and nodded solemnly. Yes, Dreezil was definitely a natural.
</p><p>Dreezil's bright smile and merry disposition led his teachers to believe that he would be perfect for confidence games and other "business" ventures, but, alas, there was one area in which the youngster was found deficient. He had a disturbing tendency toward honesty. His teachers tried their best to make him see that what he would be doing was an aid to society in general--after all, isn't it best to make sure there are neither rich nor poor classes?  Shouldn't the money be spread around more evenly? But Dreezil couldn't help but be moved by the dismay of the marks when they discovered their losses. The Deeppockets despaired of ever making Dreezil into a useful member of their society and, though they mourned the loss of the most talented halfling child ever to pick their locks, they ultimately sent him back to his parents, a failure.
</p><p>Wurrin and Teezil were heartbroken. Their golden child had been cast out of his professional guild unceremoniously. Though they loved him dearly, they were barely able to feed the mouths they already had at home. They gave him a small sack, filled with muffins and milk, and wished him well, but firmly insisted that he venture out into the world and find his place there.
</p><p>Dreezil had never felt so lonely in his life. He'd been a cherished son and a stellar student, never having heard a cross word in his life. He was puzzled about many things, not the least of which was why he had to hurt people's feelings in order to support himself. He didn't blame his teachers or his family for casting him out, but he'd never been beyond the boundaries of the Misty Thicket, and wasn't sure how or where he might find a place for himself in this world. Nevertheless, he set out to explore Norrath and find his future.
</p><p>Dreezil spent many months wandering the world, exploring the societies surrounding his tiny hometown of Rivervale, even crossing the oceans and learning how others lived on those continents. He spent many a hungry day and chilly night out there on his own. Sometimes it was necessary to "borrow" a bit of loose change he happened to find in some unwary traveler's pocket or purse, but only for the purpose of survival, he assured himself.
Dreezil was not a thief, and he'd be the first to tell you so. Often, the coins just seemed to hop out of their hiding places and into his hands. Who was he to question fortune's favors?
</p><p>The young halfling had traveled all the way to the forest of Nektulos one moonless night. Just beginning to feel the stirrings of hunger in his belly, he heard a tiny noise not far off. It sounded like someone rolling over on the ground. A very faint glow many yards away told him there was a campsite nearby. He crept closer, keeping low to the ground (not difficult for a halfling, of course), and made use of the local shrubbery to shroud him from view. 
</p><p>Creeping up behind a conveniently placed boulder, Dreezil peered out into the clearing and saw two recumbent figures sleeping on either side of a nearly dead fire. Their heads were close together, weapons carefully placed within easy reach. These two were experienced warriors, Dreezil knew immediately. He looked around the camp in the very dim light. Once again, he blessed his parents for passing on their excellent night sight to him. There, on the other side of the clearing were their packs. And how accommodating of the two to leave the packs so close to that large rock! Dreezil silently rubbed his hands together, grinning. He crept around the edge of the campsite without making a sound.
</p><p>Dreezil crouched close to a pack and reached out one hand in the dark to open it. No sooner had he put his hand on the leather flap than he discovered the point of a sword lifting his chin. A soft voice whispered to him, "What are you doing, little one?"
</p><p>The halfling looked up slowly, careful not to nick himself on the razor-sharp blade edge. He put on his best contrite expression as he looked up. Much to his surprise, he realized the swordbearer who had caught him in the act of "borrowing" was actually a woman! Dreezil's jaw dropped and he stared frankly into the eyes of the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. Blue eyes with glints of silvery light stared back at him from a pale and fine-featured face. Her shining hair spilled over her shoulders, disarrayed by sleep. Dreezil was speechless for maybe the first time in his whole life, and that was even more surprising to him than the fact that he'd been caught.
</p><p>"Well?" The high elf woman prodded him gently with the sword blade, just enough to get his attention. "Erk." Dreezil tried hard to find his tongue. "I was hungry, milady. Forgive me." To Dreezil's great chagrin, two large tears rolled down his face. He couldn't understand why, but for some reason, having considered stealing from this beautiful woman caused him to feel terribly guilty. There was something about her, something he couldn't put his finger on. She almost seemed to glow in the dark, faintly. He could see her clearly, even in the darkest part of the night.
</p><p>"All you had to do was ask, friend," the woman said softly. She placed the sword back into its scabbard and set it gently aside. "Come," she said, "sit near me by the fire."
</p><p>Dreezil found himself moving, almost as if in a dream, over to sit next to the woman, watching raptly as she stirred up the coals and added a few more sticks of wood. The little campfire popped and sparked, and a cheery blaze flared up. He looked intently at the swordmaiden until she noticed his staring.   "I'm sorry, me lady, it's just... I just... forgive me, Lady." Dreezil lowered his eyes.  "You may call me Firiona, little one. I am Firiona Vie."   "Me name's Dreezil, me Lady, Dreezil Pocketdip o' Rivervale is me." The halfling lad felt self-conscious in the presence of this great woman. Though she hadn't given herself any title, he could tell by her bearing that she was someone special. He had never known royalty, but he was sure that if he had ever seen any, they couldn't be more regal than this lady in front of him.
</p><p>Firiona chuckled softly to herself and reached for the pack, taking out a packet of rations and holding them out to Dreezil. "Here, take this and enjoy." Dreezil absent-mindedly chewed on the journey bread and looked around himself. He sipped at the container of water Firiona handed him as he did so. There on the other side of the fire was another female, sound asleep, her head on her own pack and a mandolin by her side. A staff lay by her other side. Firiona noticed the direction of Dreezil's glance.
</p><p>"That's my friend Sionachie," she said, softly. "She's a bard who has been travelling with me. Don't wake her, please."Dreezil watched the sleeping half elf for a moment and couldn't help thinking she'd be a much easier target than this high elf by his side. He shook his head to banish the thought, chuckling silently to himself. 
</p><p>"My lady, if ye'll have me, I might be a good companion to ye. I've a few skills ye may find useful. I am a skilled scout, an' I can help ye find food whene'er ye're hungry. I can help with findin' ways into and out o' tight spots too! And I'm a pretty good hand wi' a dagger if I do say so meself." The halfling rogue grinned impishly up at Firiona.
</p><p>"Then join us, my little friend. We could use company on our journey. We're simply gathering knowledge in our travels, but who knows when one of your skills might be a great help to us?" The silver-haired Fier'Dal smiled back. "For now, let's get some rest. Morning will be upon us before we know it."
</p><p>Dreezil accompanied Firiona through many subsequent adventures, right up to her fateful visit to the Ring of Scale. When the dragons stole the memories of the party, he was transported magically back to his hometown of Rivervale with no recollection of the events. He spent the next few years dabbling in various trade skills, becoming rather adept at the chemistries of poison along the way.
</p><p>The Case of the Blackburrow Stout
In his own later travels, Dreezil had many opportunities to visit with Gunrich, the goblin who lived out on Skeleton Hill in Misty Thicket. Gunrich had been aiding the Deeppockets in their smuggling activities for longer than Dreezil could remember. In one of their conversations, Gunrich let it slip that he'd been caught with a case of Blackburrow Stout while in High Pass and though he expected to be treated badly, the guard who accosted him asked for a bribe instead. Gunrich chuckled to himself as though he'd made a wise choice in giving the guard his case of stout. Dreezil fingered his chin thoughtfully as he pondered this development. Why would one of the Highpass guards be so easily swayed, he wondered? Perhaps there was some mystery there that he could root out.
</p><p>The halfling lad headed back through Rivervale and the forest of Kithicor on his way to the castle area. As he reached the High Pass, he slowed his pace and watched carefully. His instincts for caution were aroused and he trod cautiously. Sneaking up behind a large rock near moonrise one late evening, he eavesdropped on two guards who seemed to be somewhat tipsy. Every so often, they would pull something from a large skin pack that clinked when it was moved. Dreezil recognized the sound of ceramic jugs. Blackburrow Stout was his guess.
</p><p>Dreezil stood quietly, breathing evenly so that nothing would draw the attention of the guards. Of course, they were fairly well intoxicated by this point so his caution may have been unnecessary, but Dreezil never became complacent. That was one of his strongest qualities. He was not one to be lazy about things. He watched as one and then the other of the guards began to nod and drifted into a deep sleep. Only their snores punctuated the night air.
</p><p>The little rogue waited yet a bit longer, and then, when he felt the time was right, moved in slowly and picked up the skin sack. He looked around carefully and picked up all the still-full bottles he could find. He would need those as evidence, he thought. These guards were corrupt and the authorities must know of it. Dreezil salivated just a bit at the thought of the reward they would no doubt force upon him. He smiled to himself.
</p><p>He headed toward the castle keep, still smiling smugly and headed for the castle gates. Looking up at the first tall human he encountered, Dreezil opened his mouth to speak, but got no further than a startled squawk as he recognized the very guard from whom he'd stolen the sack! The guard grabbed him by the arms, picking him up and throwing him, sack and all, over his shoulder.  "AHA! Now I've found you, you smuggling thief! Carson McCabe will be pleased to hear that you were so considerate as to walk right into the castle and give yourself up!" The second guard took the skin bag and hefted it. It clinked as he did so and the first guard smiled knowingly. "We'll just show him this bag as evidence, sure enough!" The two guards headed into the castle, with Dreezil struggling and protesting all the way.
</p><p>When they took him before Carson McCabe, they had transferred eight bottles of the stout to a wooden case, leaving the rest in the sack and hiding it in their chambers on the way to the council room. When they arrived, Carson looked closely at Dreezil and recognized the guild symbol on his collar. Having the sign of the Deeppockets on him, Dreezil was clearly identified as a rogue and therefore, to McCabe, a scoundrel as well. He ignored the halfling's protests of innocence and viewed the contents of the wooden case as proof of the halfling's crime. He sent the guards to confine him in the dungeon.
</p><p>The first guard took great pleasure in escorting him down to the dank cells in the lower levels of the keep. Worse yet, they chained his hands far apart on the wall beside him - standard practice for those with acknowledged lockpicking skills. Dreezil looked confused and forlorn as the great iron cell doors clanged shut. The other prisoners stared hopelessly and took no notice of him. By the looks of them, they'd been all but forgotten down here. Dreezil stood there, shocked and amazed at this turn of events. It wasn't until the sun went down outside the tiny cell window and the darkness descended on him that he realized his predicament. It hadn't seemed possible that this could happen, but there he was and he had no idea what he would do next.
</p><p>Languishing away in his cell, the days and weeks all seemed to meld together into one long, endless, boring, miserable nightmare of an existence. He heard whispers and caught pieces of conversation echoing through the dungeon that told him that something terrible was happening in the world. He heard rumors that High Hold was under attack and that his hometown of Rivervale was taken over briefly. He assumed from the sounds of revelry some unknown days later, that the situation had resolved itself in of favor Carson McCabe and High Hold. The same guards brought his lukewarm gruel after all so it didn't seem like the place was under new management. He missed his family and feared for what may have become of them, only adding to his ceaseless misery.
</p><p>Firiona and Sionachie traveled through Antonica for many weeks, finally coming into Rivervale in their search for Dreezil. They came upon Wurrin and Teezil in a burrow not far from the local inn, known as the Fool's Gold. A fitting name, Firiona thought, for an establishment that encouraged gambling and housed the local rogue's guild. Wurrin and Teezil welcomed the paladin warmly. "Welcome t' our home, me lady!" The diminutive halfling woman smiled up at Firiona and scurried to find the largest chair to offer. "Me 'husband an' me, we've heard a great deal about ye lately! 'Tis said ye defeated th' Child o' Hate in Kithicor, it is! My, my, ye must be a powerful swordmaiden indeed!" Wurrin coughed behind one hand as he nodded. A gent of few words, was Wurrin. He pulled out a briar pipe and began to pack it with tobacco. He listened to his wife ramble on and watched the high elf lady from under his beetled brow. He sat in the corner, missing nothing.
</p><p>"Thank you, Teezil, your hospitality is second to none, to be sure," Firiona smiled, "but I was hoping you could help us with a bit of information as well...?" At this remark, Wurrin looked up sharply and puffed on his pipe, slowly blowing out the blue-white smoke in tiny rings.  "Really, me lady? What kind o' information might sech as we have f'r ye?" Teezil folded her hands across her apron as she stared, puzzled, at the high elf lady. "It concerns your son, Dreezil..." Firiona began. Teezil's eyes grew wide, and Wurrin blew another set of rings into the dim air of the burrow. "Dreezil has been a companion of mine in the past, as you know, and I would find him again. I've missed his ready wit and his skills with locks are second to none. In my travels, it would be useful to have one with his abilities nearby, and the Lady Tunare has charged me with gathering up my companions. I have not been able to find Dreezil's whereabouts, which is not unusual for a rogue of his inestimable skills, so I thought I would pay you a visit and see if you could direct me."
</p><p>Teezil's eyes clouded up a bit and she blinked, twice. "He was arrested in Highkeep, they tell me, me lady. For smugglin'. I KNOW my Dreezil wouldnae do sech a thin', 'tis nae possible. I jus' know it. He's a good boy, 'e is." Teezil wrung her hands together as she rambled on. "Now, now, goodwife, I will see what I can do for your Dreezil. I know him to be an honest young man and I will find him and rectify this situation if I can. I promise you I will find out the truth and do all I can for him." The tall half elf woman stood and smiled down at Teezil and Wurrin. "I will not trouble you further this day, my friends. My Lady has bidden me hurry in my tasks, and I must find Dreezil as soon as I may. Fare ye well."
</p><p>Firiona nodded at Sionachie and the two left, bending one blonde head and one red one to exit the door in the earthen burrow. The two stretched unconsciously after having been inside, and set out through the forest or Kithicor on their way to Highpass.
</p><p>Carson McCabe stood in the throne room of the High Keep. He looked around at his chamberlain and advisors, listening to them recount the myriad problems that were his to resolve during his afternoon session. A muffled disturbance from outside caught his ear and he looked up curiously. Two guards opened the door and ushered in a familiar elf woman and her half-elf friend. Carson smiled.
</p><p>"Firiona! How good to see you! And this must be Sionachie. I've heard of your ability with the mandolin, my dear, and your excellent singing voice. I certainly hope Firiona plans to stay here with us for a spell, so that you might favor us with a song or two?"  Sionachie blushed slightly and smiled. "Thank you, sir, for your kind words. But I believe Firiona has business to attend to." She looked over at the paladin expectantly. Firiona nodded back. "Yes, Carson, that is true. You see, I have been looking for a certain halfling lad, by the name of Dreezil. I understand he was here in Highpass Hold? Do you know anything about it?"
</p><p>Carson looked over at Arvelion, the chamberlain. The man's bald head gleamed with sweat as he stepped up to answer. The gold chain around his neck jingled with its burden of keys. "Yes, sire, I believe that is the name of the smuggler we apprehended and have incarcerated in our dungeon." He looked at the two women, his eyes slightly narrowed. "Caught him red-handed, we did," he said.  Firiona raised both eyebrows and stared at the man, whose narrow mustache and sparse beard appeared very black against his pale face. She waited for him to continue. "Er... he was carrying the contraband when he was caught!" He said earnestly. "In fact, I locked it up in the stores myself!" Sweat began to trickle down his forehead. Firiona continued to stare.
</p><p>Carson stepped up to his chamberlain and touched him lightly on the shoulder. "Go, Arvelion, bring it here. I would like to see it myself." He very gentlypushed on Arvelion's shoulder, just enough to get him started. The skinny chamberlain glided away with the faint sound of jingling keys. Several minuteslater, he returned with a wooden crate in his arms. Bottles tinked softly against one another as he walked. 
</p><p>"There, you see? We caught him with it, red-handed!" The chamberlain's face was more than a little flushed by the exertion and his earnest assertions. Firiona peered into the case and pulled out one brown bottle by its neck. She held it up to the light and examined the thick dark stout through the glass.  "Yes, it does indeed appear to be Blackburrow Stout," said Firiona as she lowered the bottle back into the case. "You say my little friend smuggled this? How long is his jail sentence?"
</p><p>Carson's brow furrowed. "Sentence? He'll sit down there till he rots as far as I'm concerned. Rogues like that are not to be trusted. Particularly the halflings. They're a scurrilous lot." Firiona's expression grew bland and she tilted her head slightly to one side. "Then he hasn't had a trial yet?" "TRIAL?!" Carson laughed loud enough to rattle the bottles in the crate. "For a halfling smuggler? I wouldn't waste my time!" 
</p><p>Firiona's eyelids lowered just slightly and her voice was very soft as she spoke, "Then perhaps I can arrange for a judge to come here and hear his case. I will represent him myself. He can have a jury as well. I know you are a fair and honorable man, McCabe. And I know you to be just, as well. It will be no trouble to you at all. I'll see to everything personally." Carson sputtered and his face flushed red. "Oh, dear. If you must, Firiona, then you must. I will agree to abide by whatever decision is made."  "Nonsense, Carson! I'd be happy to do it. In the interests of justice, of course." Firiona smiled sweetly and gestured toward the case of stout. "May I take this for safekeeping?"  Carson McCabe's puzzled frown disappeared in a resigned smile when he could think of no reason to deny her and he nodded. "Certainly, my dear. Why not? Don't drink it all in one sitting now!" He chuckled at his own joke. "Make yourselves comfortable. Arvelion will show you to your chambers and see that you have everything you require. I must finish my work, now. Welcome, Firiona, and you too, Sionachie."" He smiled again and turned back to his advisors as the women followed Arvelion out of the hall. Three days later, Firiona had managed to assemble twelve jurors from the surrounding countryside and the visiting judge, retired soldier Furley Wiggins, in the great hall of High Keep Castle. Arvelion had been appointed to represent the prosecution and Firiona was prepared with her defense. Furley, a grizzled veteran of many battles, was comfortably ensconced in a velvet-cushioned chair behind a large table. Two guards walked in with Dreezil between them, his wrists manacled to a length of wood he bore on his shoulders. They simply did not trust rogues with locks, it seemed. Dreezil bore a somewhat pained and dejected expression on his normally impish face. The guards led him to a seat in front of and to the left of the high table where he could be seen by all.
</p><p>Judge Wiggins pulled a dagger from his belt and rapped the table with the base of its hilt. "Settle down, now, settle down!" He tried to get the attention of the assembly. The jurors murmured as they settled in their seats. Firiona stood quietly and watched while the room grew quiet and then stepped forward.
</p><p>"Your Honor, I want to thank you for allowing us to present this case before you, and for taking the time to travel here from Rivervale for this purpose. If you will permit me, I would like to explain the nature of the case before us today. Dreezil Pocketdip here, who is a resident of Rivervale, and is an acknowledged member of the Deeppockets Guild there, has been accused of smuggling. To be more precise, he is accused of smuggling one case of Blackburrow Stout. His accusers are present in the courtroom, as is Dreezil himself. 
</p><p>"Your Honor, I believe that what has happened here is that the defendant has been accused strictly on the basis of circumstantial evidence - evidence which, in and of itself, is not sufficient to demonstrate the commission of any crime. As the defendant's counsel, Your Honor, I will be attempting to show how the events occurred which led to Dreezil's arrest and incarceration. I believe the jury will see that Dreezil was not involved in smuggling, but rather, was attempting to assist the authorities here in High Hold Pass in their efforts to end the smuggling. Furthermore, I will try to demonstrate that there are, in fact, other parties involved in nefarious and illegal activities right here in Highkeep."
</p><p>The onlookers murmured amongst themselves at this declaration. Firiona looked over at Carson and noted with satisfaction the look of mild surprise on  his face. She turned back to the judge and summed up her statement. "As I said, Your Honor, I thank you for allowing us to appear before you today. " The high elf sat down and folded her hands in her lap, looking over at Arvelion. The chamberlain stood up and faced the jury. "It's very simple, ladies and gentlemen. This halfling rogue," he said with obvious distaste, "was caught with the evidence in his hands just outside the keep. When I have produced my witnesses, there will be no question in your minds that he is indeed guilty of smuggling Blackburrow stout. I'm certain you will see that this rogue deserves to be punished for his nefarious activities and that you will see your way clear to finding him guilty as charged. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and you, too, Your Honor, for taking the time to hear this case today." He turned back toward Firiona, smiling smugly in anticipation of his easy victory.
</p><p>"First, Your Honor, I would like to present evidence in this case. There is a certain case of Blackburrow Stout in the possession of the defendant's counsel, which I would like to ask that she produce at this time." Arvelion sneered haughtily at Firiona. She returned his glance blandly and stood, easily lifting the heavy wooden case and carrying it over to the judge's bench. "Your Honor, at the prosecution's request, I would like to enter this case of Blackburrow Stout into evidence at this time." The judge looked down, one eyebrow twitching slightly. He motioned to Firiona to place the case on the floor near his seat, behind the bench. "Very well," said Judge Wiggins, "it can remain right there until it has been properly identified by witnesses." He peered down at his side, where the case lay, just out of sight behind his bench. Firiona returned to her seat and allowed herself a tiny smile.
</p><p>"Now then," said Arvelion, "I would like to call one Guard Heptal to the stand, if you please?" A tall guardsman moved to the front of the courtroom and took his place in front of the jury. Judge Wiggins glared down at him from under beetled brows and challenged him, "Guard Heptal, you must speak only the truth, by your oath of fealty and your honor as a guardsman, do you understand?" Heptal nodded quickly. Arvelion faced him and cleared his throat delicately before beginning. "Heptal, please tell us under what circumstances you first met the accused, if you would?"
</p><p>The tall guard's face reddened slightly, unaccustomed as he was to public speaking. "Well, sor, y'see, I was comin' out of the gate, to take m' place on duty, y'know. An', y'see, here was this halflin' just walkin' up t' me, with this big ol' case in his arms. Just as brazen as can be, y'know, walkin' up to th' gates an' grinnin'. So I says to m'self, I says, hmmm... somethin's funny about that one, I just know it. So I walks up to him and I says, HOLD! That's what we says to strangers, y'know. So he stops and I looks and sure enough, there he is, big as day, holdin' a case o' Blackburrow Stout, he was! I know that's got to be smuggled, since it isn't legal here in Highkeep or parts hereabouts, so I takes it and I arrests him, Your Lordship, sir. And there he sits, plain as day, he does. Right over there." He pointed at Dreezil.
</p><p>Dreezil frowned unhappily. The judge ducked down behind his bench, momentarily out of sight of all onlookers. A tiny pop and hiss could be heard if you were close enough, though no one but Dreezil actually was. He tilted his head to the side slightly and looked over, puzzled. The judge popped back up and Dreezil could see a slight flush on his face from this close distance. Carson moved up to the witness area and stood quietly. The judge nodded at him and said, "You know tha' you mus' speak th' truth, 'ere, an' nothin' else, righ'?" Carson frowned up at the judge, but only nodded his compliance. Judge Wiggins smiled blearily and ducked down under his desk for a moment. Carson's frown made an upside-down "V" in the skin over his nose. Firiona stepped in front of Carson, distracting him. "Carson McCabe, do you recall the occasion on which you first saw the defendant?" Carson nodded, "Yes, milady, the defendant was brought before me by Guards Heptal and Nonet, along with the contraband stout. They brought him before me and showed me the evidence, at which time I sent him to be locked up in a cell."  "And did he make no protest?" "Well, certainly, Firiona, what criminal doesn't protest his own innocence?" McCabe chuckled at this observation. "Naturally, he said he was innocent. But, the evidence was right there in front of us. He'd been caught red-handed, as it were." "What did he say in his own defense, milord?" "Why... er... I don't quite recall..." McCabe floundered for a moment. "I believe it was merely a protestation of innocence, no real details." "Isn't it true that you didn't stop to listen to his story at all?" Firiona smiled sweetly at Carson McCabe. "That you had him sent to the dungeon without hearing his story?" 
</p><p>McCabe sputtered, his face growing red. "Why, I don't know how you feel you can stand there and accuse me of such injustice, Firiona! You know me better than that!" "And yet, Dreezil Pocketdip, an acknowledged member of the Deeppockets guild, was sent to the dungeons and you are unable to recount for us the defendant's explanation. Is that a fair assessment?" "Well, er... yes. But after all, what more would I need beyond seeing the evidence? I mean, he is a rogue, after all. Why should I lend credence to his tale?"
</p><p>The judge hiccuped loudly and disappeared under his bench, this time for almost three minutes. Firiona paced in front of Carson while she waited for the judge to sit up straight again. She looked up at him and noted with some satisfaction that his nose was beginning to look very red.
</p><p>"Now then, milord," Firiona turned back to Carson McCabe, "what sentence did you impose on the defendant?" Carson blinked, several times. "Sentence? I had actually not pronounced any particular...er... period of time... that is to say... well... I just had him thrown into the dungeons. I hadn't considered letting him go just yet."  "Then what happened was that you put Dreezil into a cell without giving him an opportunity to defend himself, and without knowing when, if ever, he might be released?" Carson's face was, by this time, nearly as red as Judge Wiggins', though not for the same reasons. The judge, by this time, was weaving slightly from side to side as he sat on the bench. His round face was frozen in a beatific smile and his eyes watered slightly as he beamed down on the courtroom.  Carson jumped up, stamped his foot angrily and shouted at Firiona, "How can you accuse me this way, milady? I will not sit here and be insulted so! Why, this..."
</p><p>Judge Wiggins interrupted with an even louder, if somewhat slurred, voice, "Sharrup! Orr'er in th' Court! Siddown an' sharrup, McCabe! Lissen t' th' lady talk, why doncha...? The judge's voice trailed off as a smile once more settled over his features and he folded his arms comfortably on the bench before him. Carson sat down as if his legs suddenly refused to hold him up. He sat, stunned, staring at the judge, who disappeared again behind the bench for a moment.
</p><p>Firiona grinned to herself. She looked over at Dreezil encouragingly. Dreezil was stunned and amused. He could see the rosy glow on the judge's face as clearly as anyone in the courtroom could. He stifled a snicker, thinking how Carson had agreed to abide by Wiggins' decision. Not wishing to anger McCabe, however, he straightened himself and composed his features.
</p><p>"Thank you, your Honor," smiled Firiona. The judge grinned back and lowered his chin to rest on his wrists, his eyelids drooping just slightly. He winked at Firiona once and settled in to listen.
</p><p>"Carson McCabe, is it normally your practice to assume the guilt of a person before even examining the evidence?" Carson sputtered angrily, not even noticing when Judge Wiggins slipped down behind the desk. "Firiona! How could you? You know me much better than that." "Yes, Carson, and I have always known you to be fair. I have never known you to take anything at face value. Perhaps the case you saw was not a case of Blackburrow Stout, though, could that be possible?"
</p><p>"Why... "Carson's brow furrowed. "It had the distinctive markings, and was filled with the very bottles the Blackburrow gnolls are famed for using. I don't know how it could be anything else!"
"Did you examine the contents of those bottles, McCabe?" "I did not..." Carson's brow smoothed out and he looked just a bit resigned. "No, Firiona, I'm afraid I neglected to even determine if they were full or empty." Carson raised both hands in a conciliatory gesture. He smiled weakly. "Then you don't truly know what was in the case, is that correct?" "Yes, Firiona, that is correct." Carson's sheepish expression fitted him oddly.
</p><p>Firiona smiled at her friend. "Perhaps we should take a look at the evidence at this time. Your Honor..." Firiona looked up at the empty bench. "Your Honor?" Firiona approached the bench and walked around it to the side where the case of stout had been resting. The judge suddenly appeared above the desk, red-faced and grinning widely.  "Yesh, what izh it?" The judge slurred amiably. "Oh... yesh.. edivence. Yesh... here you go, Finiroa... Rinifoa... er... Faryena, whatever yer name is." He reached down and lifted up the wooden box, which rattled loudly. Firiona quickly grabbed it, fearing it would fall. She placed it atop the desk and looked it over. Only three of the bottles remained intact. All the others had been opened and emptied. She peered up at the judge, her expression bland. She picked up the heavy wooden case again and carried it over to Carson. "Is this the case you saw the defendant carrying?" "Well, no, I didn't see him with it myself, but the guards who arrested it brought it to me directly." "Oh? So they saw him carrying it, did they?" "So they indicated to me, yes."
</p><p>Firiona carried the box over to Dreezil and laid it on the ground near him. It was easy to see that the halfling would have had a difficult time carrying even a few full ceramic bottles of the potent brew in a heavy wooden box like this one.  "Your Honor, may I request that the defendant be unshackled, please?" Arvelion frowned unhappily and began to whisper noisily. "Sharrup, you!" The judge yelled at the chamberlain. "Yes, Feery-owna," he pronounced carefully, "you may. Guard! Unlock th' pris'ner."
</p><p>"Thank you, your Honor. Now then, Dreezil," Firiona said to the halfling as he rubbed his wrists gingerly, "please pick up the crate for me, if you would?" Dreezil bent his knees and tried to reach the sides of the box lengthwise, but his short arms just didn't reach. He turned the box sideways and tried to grab it from one end. His arms didn't quite reach to its middle, but he managed to stand with the box in front of him. Firiona took one of the three full bottles from the end nearest Dreezil and replaced it in the other end. The wooden case tipped forward and Dreezil almost dropped it. He leaned back precariously to balance.
</p><p>"Your Honor, I think it's clear that Dreezil didn't carry this box filled with full bottles of Blackburrow stout. As you can see, with less than half the weight of the box on the far end, Dreezil is barely able to balance it. The weight of this box is obviously too much for him to have carried any distance." Firiona turned to the jury and pointed at Dreezil, red-faced and puffing a bit at the weight he was holding. "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm certain you can see that this halfling could not very well have carried this box full of the distinctive ceramic bottles of Blackburrow stout. And I am about to show you something I have learned that may surprise you. Sionachie, if you would, please bring me the additional evidence." Firiona turned to her friend, who stood calmly near the doors.
</p><p>Sionachie hitched up a leather sack, the sight of which brought a look of horror to the face of both Heptal and Nonet, sitting there in the front of the courtroom. The half-elf bard carried the bag to Firiona and returned to her place near the doors. Firiona lifted the bag, clinking with bottles, and rested it on the table in front of her. She spoke clearly in the room.
</p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this bag was found in the quarters of the two guards seated behind the chamberlain." She turned and pointed at both Heptal and Nonet. "It was found there just this morning, by my friend, Sionachie Heartsinger, after the guards had left for the courtroom. I'd like you to take a look at what is inside."
</p><p>Firiona opened the bag and held it out so that the jurors could see the ceramic bottles of Blackburrow stout inside. The jurors gasped and muttered among themselves as they considered the meaning of this development. Twelve pairs of eyes turned to the two guards, who sat there fidgeting as the paladin continued.
</p><p>"You will notice that these bottles appear to be of exactly the same type as the ones in the wooden case that Dreezil is holding. They bear the stamp, in the gnollish script, of Blackburrow, as do the others. As to what is inside them, I invite you to determine that for yourselves." Firiona held out the bag to the jurors and offered each a bottle of the creamy brown brew. She smiled softly as she watched them helping each other open the bottles and taste the contents. With twelve of the remaining bottles gone, the sack was considerably lighter. She offered the last few to the judge, Carson and Arvelion. When the latter refused, she drank the last bottle herself.
</p><p>"Well, now that you've tried the drink, what would you say it was?" Firiona turned to the first juror, who answered, "Blackburrow stout!" Firiona smiled.  "And you?" Firiona asked the next. He answered likewise."Carson, what is your assessment?" He turned to her and replied, "Why, the jurors have already told you, Blackburrow stout." "I find it extremely interesting, your Honor, that so many of these jurors and Carson McCabe himself have tasted enough of a contraband brew that they are able to identify it so easily." Firiona allowed herself the ghost of a smirk as the judge chortled.
</p><p>Carson's face darkened slightly, but Firiona smiled at him. "Don't worry, Carson, I understand that you've traveled extensively, and to be honest, this is a very distinctive flavor. Having tasted it once, you'd recognize it easily again, I'm sure." Carson relaxed slightly and Firiona went on. "The thing is here, your Honor, that there were many more bottles originally taken than the ones produced here as evidence. Apparently Guards Heptal and Nonet had the rest stashed in their quarters. I think we're pretty much agreed that the brew within them is, in fact, Blackburrow Stout. Perhaps we should turn to the defendant to learn from him exactly what happened?
</p><p>"Dreezil, you may put the box down," Firiona smiled at the halfling lad. "Now then, Dreezil, on your oath to the Deeppockets, please tell us how you came by the stout?"
</p><p>Judge Wiggins burped loudly as Dreezil began his testimony, having finished off his bottle of stout, wiped his mouth on the back of one forearm and settled himself comfortably to listen. "I'd seen those two in th' woods, Firiona, er... milady. They were drinkin' th' stout, ye know. Gunrich, a goblin I know in the Misty Thicket, he told me they'd beaten him for it. Robb'd him, they did. I track'd them back t' where they were campin', milady, an' watch'd 'em drink 'emselves silly. They went t' sleep an' I took what was left in that sack. Brought it back 'ere, thinkin' I was gonna get meself a reward f'r it, ye know. But b'fore I could turn it in, they caught up t' me an' grabb'd me. They made t' bring me t' Carson, but stopp'd on th' way an' pulled out one o' their cases, fillin' it from me sack. They left th' rest in their quarters, ye know. I tried t' tell 'im, milady, but 'e wouldnae listen t' me." Dreezil ran out of breath near the end of his declaration and stood there panting softly.
</p><p>Carson looked over at his two guards, who recognized the look of accusation in hiseyes and bolted for the doors. They shoved Sionachie harshly out of the way and burst through the doors to escape. "After them!" shouted Carson McCabe. "Guards! Go to their quarters and don't let anyone enter them until I've had them searched!" Several guards and onlookers chased out of the courtroom after the two guards. The judge stood and shouted for the jury to remain seated, and then promptly lost his balance and sat down, hard.
</p><p>Firiona stepped up to the jury and addressed them. "You see, ladies and gentlemen, the guards Nonet and Heptal have been heavily involved in the smuggling for quite some time. Other bags found in their rooms," she said as she gestured Sionachie forward, carrying several small bags, "contained large amounts of gold. It seems that they were making a fairly good sideline out of smuggling, too. I don't think it would be out of line for me to offer you this gold as recompense for your work here today, ladies and gentlemen. To make up for what you have lost in wages, having left your own trades to come here and assist us in learning the truth." Firiona handed a small bag of gold to each juror and then turned back to the judge.
</p><p>Furley was weaving back and forth and smiling happily on the bench as he looked down at Firiona. He put his chin on one palm, resting the elbow on the desk, so he could focus on her. "S'ank you, Feeny... Feery-owna," he slurred, "you did a jate grob... er... jood gob... um... Nice work!" He looked around at the courtroom and once again banged his knife hilt on the desktop, declaring, "Releash the pris'ner! He's issonent, er... innocent! Let 'im go. Thish court is adjourn'd!" He climbed down from his bench and weaved across the room, where the onlookers, Firiona, and Carson were milling around.
</p><p>"Carshon," the judge eyed him blearily, "you make sure to put thozhe guardsh of yourzh in that shame shell that Dreezhil was in, you hear?" He nodded as if he knew something very important, then smiled at Firiona. "Me lady, you come to Rivervale any time you want. I'll zhow you aroun', don'chyou worry."  Firiona chuckled softly and shook the judge's hand.
</p><p>"Milady Firiona, my apologies," said Carson McCabe to the paladin as the judge ambled away. "I will be more careful whom I trust without examining evidence for myself in future, of that you can be sure." "Thank you, Carson, that is all anyone can ask of you." She smiled at him warmly. "And I hope you will handsomely reward those who return the guards to you as well."  "You can rest assured, Milady, it is worth a great deal to me to have such criminals apprehended. To think how long this may have been going on. I'm shocked, but very glad you've helped to root out this evil. You have my gratitude." He took Firiona's hand and bowed low over it. She smiled and headed off to her rooms with Sionachie.
</p><p>Hours later, McCabe offered additional bags of gold and a jewel apiece to those who had accompanied his guards to apprehend the smugglers. Arvelion grumbled, but brought out huge pitchers of ale for all and they drank merrily long into the night.
</p><p><b>Drinal</b><br />
First moon of Norrath.
</p><p><b>Drolvarg</b><br />
A race of lycanthrope creatures that inhabit Kunark.
</p><p><b>Drusella Sathir</b><br />
Emperor Sathir's beloved, Drusella, rests within a grand crypt in Charasis' depths. After her funeral and burial, Emperor Sathir cast all citizens from the cliff city, and forbade them from returning on pain of death. Only the royal guard and servants where allowed to stay.  (Allakhazam’s Magical Realm)
</p><p><b>Duskan Hammerhand</b><br />
The Champion of the Dwarves and the Defender of Butcherblock’s Hammer.
</p><p>The Hammer of Dagnor (Butcherblock Hammer, Dagnor’s Fist)
Butcherblock, the first dwarven king, appears before the dwarven rogue Duskan Hammerhand and a dark elven cleric named Teuil N'Mar. In the vision, the hammer is revealed, secreted beneath the murky waters of Dagnor's Cauldron within a barnacle-encrusted tower, and guarded by aqua goblins. Duskan recognizes the holy relic, and immediately makes a foolish attempt to retrieve the hammer alone, desiring the glory of the successful deed solely for himself. He fails, narrowly escaping the aqua goblins with his life.
</p><p>Crawling along the shore, barely coherent and near death, Duskan manages to convince a party of passing adventurers to escort him to his King. When Duskan is brought before King Kazon Stormhammer and reveals his story of the vision and his botched raid, the King organizes an expedition for the recovery of the Butcherblock Hammer, known among the dwarves as Dagnor's Fist. Three dwarven champions are chosen to head the effort: Boris Stormhammer, the King's nephew, Kalek Orefinder, and Fenric Ogrebane, son of the legendary Furtog Ogrebane. These three, aided by the adventurers, easily cut down the aqua goblins guarding the hammer. As the goblin Tidal Lord is dying, Phinigel Autropos himself appears. He stymies the dwarves and adventurers, driving them back. Then, as swiftly as he appeared, he disappears. The dwarves and adventurers finish off the last goblin and rescue the hammer.
</p><p>As they march victoriously back to Kaladim, a dark elven raiding party ambushes and slaughters them. In the fight, the dark elven wizard perishes, preventing the raiders' return to Neriak. The leader, Valkis D'Vinn, carefully seals the captured relic in an enchanted adamantium chest, and orders his group to march to Crushbone, where another dark elven wizard awaits.  Fenric, thought dead but actually feigning, overhears these plans, and immediately seeks help once they leave.
</p><p>The dark elven raiding party discovers upon returning to Crushbone that the wizard they sought, Szasi R'Alis, is dead, along with Grak Crushbone, who died defending her. Valkis attempts to bargain with the adventurers who surround them, but is quickly cut down. The sealed Adamant Chest of Thex passes into the possession of the adventurers, who return to Kaladim to deliver the chest to King Kazon. The Dwarven King declares the dwarf in the party of adventurers his champion, and instructs him to return with the key to the chest.
</p><p>The adventurers travel to Nektulos and slay Captain Na'Var, holder of the key. The Captain struggles, but is outmatched. The adventurers take the key back to the King, who rewards them with baubles from his treasury. The King then declares the dwarf adventurer who was integral to the success of the mission to be Champion of the Dwarves, and Guardian of Butcherblock's Hammer.
