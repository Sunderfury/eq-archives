What if you could check out what was going on in the game at any given moment at certain locations?<br><br>Player Zanderon dubbed it "Evercam."<br><br>Although it was just a suggestion by Zanderon, player Odena <a href=http://24.234.136.145:8080">actually built a prototype</a> and linked to it in the thread.  The first Evercam is by the magus in the guild hall.  It is working if you want to check it out.<br><br>A neat idea!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 6 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29074">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29074</a><br>Printed On: Sun Aug 19 1:35:42 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
