That is true across the board:  most classes have more characters under 40 than over it.   A couple of exceptions seem to be enchanters (probably leveled up for KEI buffs) and druids.<br><br>But here's the question: if a common complaint has been that there is no one to group with at the lower levels, how is it that characters above level 65 make up a small minority of players?<br><br>Statistics are always interesting, but interpreting them can be more so.<br><br>See more facts on percentages of class levels in <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50095">Kytherea's Keepsakes.</></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 3 March, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15445">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15445</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 3:01:08 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
