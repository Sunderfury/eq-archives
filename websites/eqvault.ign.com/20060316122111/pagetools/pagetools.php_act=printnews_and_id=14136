I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to explore the Elddar Forest, the lush wilderness that existed where the Desert of Ro currently stands, and the stories behind how that catastrophe came about.<br><br>In addition, most of the new features we've created for this expansion are there to enhance the type of content we can design. These new features really open up the doors for use to be able to create new and exciting things for players to do. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more use of them in the future as we continue to strive to make Norrath a living, breathing world.<br><br><i>Kwill: What level of play is the expansion geared toward?</i><br><br>SOE: The new zones begin at around level 50 and go up from there including raid content meant to challenge people who have defeated the Demi-Plane of Blood. For lower level players, there is new content off the revamped zones of Freeport and Ro as well as a variety of new monster missions that can be done by any level.<br><br><i>Kwill: In Depths of Darkhollow, the theme was definitely a “romantic/classical” haunted castle and old civilizations, very much a fantasy playground … what does this expansion theme suggest?</i><br> <br>SOE: We've kept things high fantasy for Prophecy of Ro. Players will have the opportunity to explore fantastic new Planes and even travel back in time to see areas only spoken of in lore.  There are really 4 distinct areas within the expansion, each of which has its own theme. Some are fantastical, magical places while others are harsh, wore-torn lands. The story that ties them all together is one of great loss and impending darkness.<br><br><i>Kwill: Will there still be three Ro zones?</i><br><br>SOE: The original three zones of North Ro, Oasis and South Ro really felt like they were one zone that just happened to be broken up by zone lines. When recreating these zones, we built them as one zone to ensure the areas flow together well.  As you can imagine, that makes for one massive zone, and a zone of that size can be quite taxing on a computer. Right now, we're doing testing and optimizations in the zone to ensure that frame rates stay high. The number of zones that eventually make up the new Ro will depend on how well that turns out.<br><br><i>Kwill: Can you explain the “destructible objects” feature a little more?  What zones will we be able to use those in?</i><br><br>SOE: Destructible objects refer to objects and terrain that can take damage, visually degrade, and eventually be destroyed by players attacking them.  They run the gamut from doors you can chop down to walls you can crumble, all the way up to full encampments you can raze. Most of the new expansion zones make use of them to one degree or another, but they feature prominently in the Plane of Rage, a devastated land in the throes of a war that has lasted for eons.<br><br><i>Kwill: I saw a catapult in the screen shots, will those be active parts of the game?</i><br><br>SOE: The catapults are one of several siege weapons that the NPCs within the Plane of Rage use to rain death upon their enemies.  While players won't be able to hop into them and launch giant rocks at each other, they do play a part in some of the battles and players will receive quests to destroy these weapons before they can be used to decimate opposing armies.<br><br><i>Kwill: Will there be new shrouds?</i><br><br>SOE: We are not adding new shrouds with Prophecy of Ro.<br> <br><i>Kwill: Will there be any new content directed toward solo play?</i><br><br>SOE: We put a large emphasis on the static zone content for Prophecy of Ro, including the creation of a bunch of new quests for players to undertake in the new zones. Many of these quests can be undertaken solo, although they may require some help to complete successfully depending on the strength of your character.<br> <br><i>Kwill: With the increase in the number of expansion released per year, how is the casual gamer being encouraged to explore more of the game in depth instead of just moving on to the new content?</i><br> <br>SOE: We've been releasing two expansions a year for several years. It ensures that there is always something new for players to explore. We try to ensure that all content is entertaining and unique so that players can venture to many different areas of the game and get a different game play experience and get involved in a different storyline.<br> <br><i>Kwill: What is the ratio of raid versus single-group content?</i><br><br>SOE: It's hard to say what the exact ratio is, but we've tried to strike a good balance between single-group and raid content. There should be plenty of content to keep both groups entertained for quite a while.<br> <br><i>Kwill: Will there be any new character animations?</i><br><br>SOE: We haven't added any new animations to PCs.<br><br><i>Thanks so much to all the devs who answered these questions.  I think there's a little bit more to the expansion than just more eight bank slots!</i><br><br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 13 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14136">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14136</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:21:11 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
