I think that's a good thing ... although I believe we aren't using the word "addicted" anymore, are we?  "Inappropriate play habits" is the term now, so I hear.<br><br>My other gripe is referring to EQ in the past tense by the author ["The game, which shipped in 1999, <strong>was</strong> hugely popular with players and critics alike"], when it's still getting bigger and better, and is just as addictive as ever!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 23 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32335">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32335</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 4 0:25:20 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
