This feature is aimed at the casual gamer that wants to more easily meet up and talk with friends in game, and can be compared to "guild lite" if you will.<br><br>The EQ development team strives to keep their community-centered mission as a core value in the game, and fellowships are certainly a feature that takes the game further toward that goal.<br><br>Next week, after the NDA has been lifted, I will be posting an review of the entire expansion with lots and lots of screenshots.  Until then, you can catch a glimpse of the redesigned human model in the link above to CR.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 4 Feb, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26180">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=26180</a><br>Printed On: Sun Sep 2 3:05:07 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
