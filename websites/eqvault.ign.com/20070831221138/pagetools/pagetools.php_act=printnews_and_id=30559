See pictures of the old zone and the new here at <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50476"> EQPlayers.</a><br><br>The official description:<br>"Misty Thicket is a small forest neighboring the dungeon of Runnyeye Citadel and the Halfling city of Rivervale. It is a relatively safe for hunting and is a great source of food for the Halflings who live nearby. Yet there are few smaller bands of somewhat aggressive humanoids who live in the woods and often pose minor problems for the people of Rivervale. <br><br>Just outside the small cavern entrance to the town of Rivervale, several earthen huts are dispersed about the flag sparsely-wooded area of the thicket. These are merchant huts where tradesman make a living selling their wares to adventurers and purchasing materials that could perhaps be of potential use. <br><br>The forest itself is split into two sections by a largest stone wall known as the Wall of Serillis, and formerly known as the Great Wall of Cetelt. The wall serves as a barrier to protect the citizens for Rivervale from Clan Runnyeye who inhabit the nearby bastion. <br><br>A famed human adventurer name Cetelt, who had retired to live in the area of Misty Thicket, set his followers to build the great wall. Some say he had them do it out of his great concern for the halfling people, as the wall protects them from the goblins of Clan Runnyeye. The goblin citadel can be found on the other side of the wall – called the "bad side" by the Halflings. Others, however, seem to think that Cetelt devised the project as a "make-work" opportunity for his followers who, to Cetelt's chagrin, continued to flow him throughout most of his lifetime, begging him to fulfill their need for a hero and leader. <br><br>The wall was later dedicated by the local halflings to Brell Serillis – one of their chief gods, along with Karana, and Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane."<br><br>Misty Thicket, being one of the first EverQuest zones, acquired a reputation with the players who were newbies there.  Attractions included getting killed by the underconned named goblin, killing the wandering halfling's pet bug Ember and suffering the consequences of his wrath, and zoning into Runnyeye and getting charmed to the basement by the evil eyes and never getting your corpse back (this was before the altars in the guild hall, of course).<br><br>The guards with their masks always looked like the "hamburgler" guy from the old McDonalds ads!<br><br>Misty Thicket is also the home of the newbie player massacre that masqueraded as a GM Event at the opening of the Plane of Hate.  Dark elf GMs slaughtered people left and right as the forces of evil attacked Rivervale.  Corpses were piled high at the Misty Thicket zone in to Rivervale, because as soon as a player returned to bind they would be killed again. Higher level characters (that meant level 50) rushed to the zone to try to protect the city from its attackers.   Most people were in complete ignorance of what was going on, and only knew that something very bad was happening in the usually peaceful hamlet!<br><br>One of the oldest zones in EverQuest, Misty Thicket has a history all its own.  Its a zone that's worthy of a facelift.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 25 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30559">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30559</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 31 15:11:38 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
