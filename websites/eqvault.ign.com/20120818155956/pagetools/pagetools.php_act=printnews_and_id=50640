This proclamation serves to commemorate the 10th anniversary and launch of EverQuest on this day as well as the continued support and dedication SOE shows to the city and community of San Diego!<br><br>I recently had the opportunity speak with SOE's Taina Rodriguez about SOE Day. When asked if this would be a holiday for San Diego residents,  I was jokingly told "only if they plan to spend it playing EverQuest!". Congratulations to Sony Online Entertainment and EverQuest for scoring their very own day.<br><br>You're invited to join in on this historical event! If you're in the San Diego area on March 10, 2009 then be sure to head over to 202 C St., 12th Floor Council Chambers, the meeting starts at 10 AM and the proclamation will be shortly after.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 4 Mar, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=50640">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=50640</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 18 8:59:56 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
