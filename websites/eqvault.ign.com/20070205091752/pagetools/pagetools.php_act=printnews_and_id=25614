We are a high-end PST raiding guild on the Saryrn server of Everquest. Current targets include TSS, Deathknell and Demiplane of Blood. <br><br>The key things we expect from our guildmates are maturity, team spirit, the drive to succeed, promptness, attentiveness and the ability to play within our scheduled raid times. Our scheduled raid times are Tuesday 7-11pm PST, Thursday 7-11pm PST, and Sunday 6-11pm PST. These times were chosen to enable people on the West Coast with day jobs and active lives to participate. We raid fewer days per week than other EQ raiding guilds at our level, so regular attendance is absolutely vital to our success. If you cannot participate in all of our events in their entirety, Descendents is not for you. <br>Requirements for joining are: <br><br>Level 75 <br>500 or more TOTAL AA points <br>Keys/flags for Dreadspire and Theater of Blood <br>Hitpoints/mana/ac within 80% of the average for Descendents members of your class <br>Good knowledge of zones, and the ability to travel to common raid destinations on all continents with a minimum of death and carnage <br>The ability to meet all our raid times in their entirety <br>A reliable, preferably high-speed internet connection <br>A functioning sound card and speakers <br><br>Please recognize that Descendents is highly selective, and we take the application and temp process very seriously. The quality and legibility of an application, responses to questions on the application and conduct during the temp period carry great weight. Our continuing goal is to experience and enjoy the end game of Everquest with people who will make it worthwhile. <br><br>Ultimately this is a guild for active, highly skilled players, and our recruiting decisions will be made with the intention of enhancing our team's ability to win the battles we choose to fight.
