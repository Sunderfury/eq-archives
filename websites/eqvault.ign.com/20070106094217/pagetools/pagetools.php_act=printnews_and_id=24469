Change can be a good thing for an MMO, bringing in fresh ideas, so we will see what a new producer has in store for the development team.  Jourdian's letter seems to suggest that the next expansion may have some kind of pirate theme?  Interesting.  Here is the official announcement from EQLive:<br><br>Producer’s Letter - Announcing a change in the guard… <br><br>Farewell... I am here to bid a fond adieu. It has been an incredible honor to work on the EverQuest team these past years but it is time for me to move on. I never would have dreamed of this when my Druid was baking Batwing Crunchies back in '99. Yeah, I know they were useless but I liked to bake! <br><br>For me EverQuest has earned a place in video game history and I feel lucky to be one of the many people that have gotten in the saddle for a while. Not only that but to have the timing to have been at the right place and the right time to accept the star on the Walk of Game on behalf of the game was fantastic. To represent EverQuest shoulder to shoulder with the greats such as Final Fantasy, Starcraft, Sid Meier and John Carmack was a great experience.<br><br>We all know that EverQuest is more than a game to most of us. I have met a number of you at Fan Faires and various functions and I have always been impressed with the maturity and passion that I have seen. There are a number of you that I now count as friends. I guess what I am saying is that this has been more than just a fun job but also a personally rewarding experience. Thanks to all of you – even the cranky ones!<br><br>Happy trails and good hunting.<br><br>Chris "Raghnell" Lena<br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Hello EverQuest players! My name is Clint Worley and I would like to say that I am very excited about becoming part of the EverQuest community.<br><br>I started at Sony when it was Sony Interactive back in 1995, then we made the transition to 989 Studios, Verant followed and now Sony Online Entertainment. I have seen EverQuest grow from the initial launch to what it is today and I have to say that I am impressed! The player's feedback and SOE's internal dedication have continued to fuel the creative work that expands the EverQuest world to this day. <br><br>I am looking forward to talking with many of you and helping the future of EverQuest continue to grow. We are very busy right now on our next expansion and I can assure you that you will all be saying "Aarrr!" once it is done!<br><br>Clint "Jourdian" Worley<br>EverQuest Producer<br>Sony Online Entertainment<br> <br> <br> </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 16 Dec, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24469">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24469</a><br>Printed On: Sat Jan 6 1:42:17 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
