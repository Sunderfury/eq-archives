This rift leads to a bleak prophecy of the end of existence. The world of Norrath lies in ruins. The planet has shattered into millions of shards, spinning in a silent void around the rapidly blackening star of Ro. <br>In the wreckage on a small shard of the world, a lone figure sits quietly tending a small seedling growing between the rocks. The lone figure is none other than the fallen god Zebuxoruk. <br>Zebuxoruk is certainly insane, but has a unique insight into the current state of the world and possibly might hold the knowledge to guide adventurers in the quest to prevent the destruction of Norrath. Only he can direct adventurers towards specific moments in time where the armies of Discord were able to disrupt the timeline. <br>If they are able to stop the forces of Discord, the destruction in The Void will slowly be repaired. If not, all hope will be lost.<br>For more Seeds of Destruction Lore read the Unfolding the Lore series. <br>Level Cap Increase <br>Players can now achieve level 85. New high level item sets, new Alternate Advancement ability lines, new spells, and new skill caps come with this increase. <br>New Content <br>New themed realms for adventurers to explore including Oceangreen, Bloody Kithicor, Field of Bone, Invasion of Earth, Kuua, and Discord. Travel through the rift in Time solo, with a group, or in raids to complete new quests, tasks, and events to acquire new items, spells, tradeskill recipes, and abilities. <br>Mercenaries <br>Mercenaries are NPCs for hire that will aid adventurers in their heroic endeavors. Their levels and abilities will scale appropriately and they will think and act for themselves with limited player guidance. They are designed for extra support or extra muscle in PvE encounters. <br>Unlike player pets, these NPCs are not directly controllable by players, though the player can give them general orders. They function like a normal party member including taking up a group slot and taking a share of the experience. <br>Mercenary Liaisons can be found in the Plane of Knowledge as well as all starting cities and will allow you to hire mercenaries based on their race. The Liaisons within the Plane of Knowledge will allow you to hire mercenaries of any player race. These merchants can be found using the Find ability. <br>Before purchasing a mercenary be sure to read the descriptions, cost value, and restrictions. There are different levels and tiers available. Some mercenaries may not available until you have completed certain content but there are some apprentice and journeyman ones available to all. <br>Mercenares have a one-time hire cost and an upkeep cost that is charged every 15 minutes. The hire cost is usually much higher than the upkeep cost. <br>There are two classes of Mercenaries available - Tank and Healer. <br>Healer Mercenary: Healer mercenaries prefer to heal and buff their owner and others in the group rather than engage directly in combat. These mercenaries can also resurrect players upon death. <br>Tank Mercenary: Tank mercenaries prefer to melee. They will taunt if it is set to the main tank role. Though it will still attack and behave as a secondary tank if it is not set as main tank. If your group has someone with the puller role, mercenaries will only assist them when they and any NPCs chasing them are near camp. Any mercenary owned by the puller will stay back with the group. <br>Like pets, mercenaries will not aggro NPCs on their own. <br>Mercenaries can be suspended like a pet, though they will remain suspended forever or until you dismiss them. Mercenaries will be suspended automatically when entering most raid zones. They must also be suspended before you join a raid. <br>If your mercenary dies, it can be revived after five minutes with an additional upkeep charge. <br>Some mercenaries may not think your gold is worth them risking their life. Those with higher confidence in themselves will cost more money. <br><br><br>Live Highlights <br>As a part of SOE's EverQuest and EverQuest II Living Legacy celebration that took place this summer, SOE and the Legends of Norrath team searched for two enthusiastic players who have what it takes to be immortalized in their favorite MMOs! Everyone was invited to submit their photos for this special contest. <br>Out of all the submissions, Khyandys Aramyndan of the Altruistic Valorians guild on the Erollisi Marr server was selected as the winner for EverQuest! Her photo was transformed to a Legends of Norrath card and a statue of her character was placed within the Guild Hall in EverQuest! Congratulations Khyandys! <br>"The light is dim and unnatural, but nevertheless, it shines. Gaze upon it and do not fear. <br>Our allies have fallen and failed to vanquish the foe, but we yet remain. Take courage. <br>The enemy will turn on us soon, but we are not without strength. Steel yourself. <br>You, like our allies before us, will also fall, but it will not be in vain. Ready your weapons. <br>They have died and you will die, but I will live. Think me not selfish. <br>I behold tragedy on all sides, but I do not grieve for the dead. Think me not heartless. <br>The bodies are lifeless, yet they rise to battle once more. Think it not desecration. <br>The foe falls, though we have paid our all for this victory. Think it not robbery." <br>--Khyandys Aramyndan <br><br>For more tips on this, visit the EverQuest Seeds of Destruction thread over on the official EverQuest forums.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 21 Oct, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=46480">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=46480</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 21:16:41 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
