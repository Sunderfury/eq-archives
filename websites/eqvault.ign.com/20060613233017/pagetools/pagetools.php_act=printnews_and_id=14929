The next Live Update is scheduled for February 21, 2006.<br><br>*** Events ***<br><br>– Raids in Dynamic zones in Gates of Discord now require a minimum of 12 people to be started.<br><br>- Sendaii the Hive Queen raid will now lock out the expedition after the glowing egg is broken.<br><br>- NPC’s should no longer re-spawn after being killed in the Controlling the Beast mission set in Stoneroot Falls.<br><br>- The mission “Taking Control” from Stoneroot Falls now only requires 3 people to start it.<br><br>- Adjusted the rewards on monster missions so they scale better based on how long it’s actually taking to complete the mission.<br><br>*** Tradeskills ***<br><br>– Deep Orc Essence now requires less meat.<br><br>– Disabled the spell research creation of the spell Draught of Lightning.  This was done because it is a quest derived spell.<br><br>– Some very old erudite only combines have had their trivials adjusted up from being no-fail to on par with other combines of that era.<br><br>*** Items ***<br><br>– Changed the Slot12 Tradeskill augments that have Cleave, Ferocity, Furious Bash, Improved Dodge, Improved Parry and Sharpshooting to be worn effects instead of focus effects.<br><br>*** New Hot Zones ***<br><br>- The time has come to once again update the "Hot Zones" throughout Norrath. The previous zones have been reverted to their former states and the following zones are now a great place to go for experience and fun:<br><br>Level 20: Najena <br>Level 25: Iceclad Ocean <br>Level 30: Rathe Mountains <br>Level 35: Frontier Mountains <br>Level 40: Gulf of Gunthak <br>Level 45: Velketor's Labrynth <br>Level 50: Fungus Grove <br>Level 55: Old Sebilis <br>Level 60: Cazic Thule <br>January 27, 2006<br><br>***************<br><br>*** Notices ***<br><br>- Purging old email<br><br>In two weeks we will be conducting a purge of all in-game emails older than four months.  If you wish to keep emails older than four months then please resend them to yourself.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.<br><br>- Default User Interface<br><br>We would like to remind everyone that we do not actively maintain the old user interface.  If you are still using the older UI then it will have to be updated like any other custom UI when Prophecy of Ro is released on February 21st.<br><br>***************<br><br>December 20, 2005<br><br>These items are currently on the Test Server.  We expect these will be going to Live Servers in Upcoming Live Updates, but can not guarantee they will be in the next Live Update.  Please feel free to log onto Test and check them out!<br><br>*** Events ***<br><br>- The planar projection for defeating Mithaniel Marr was not rewarding the correct character flags.  This has been fixed.<br><br>*** Tradeskills ***<br><br>– Planar Fletching Kits are now tradeable.<br><br>- Changed Othmir Short Beer to use a bottle instead of a Cask.<br><br>*** Spells ***<br><br>- Increased the duration and lowered the mana cost of Talisman of the Tribunal.<br><br>- The Test of Efficiency spell should no longer conflict with Peace of the Disciple or Grace of the Order.<br><br>*** AAs ***<br><br>- Gift of Mana will no longer be used up when casting a 0 mana spell after it has triggered on you.<br><br>- Gift of Mana should now have a chance to trigger on heals other than just instant heals, including heal over time and percent healing spells.<br><br>- The way that the wizard AA Mana Burn works has been modified.  The new version will use a maximum of 3000 mana instead of draining your whole pool and will do 4 damage for every point of mana spent.  This is a raw channeling of magical energy that cannot be focused, and will not crit.  The ability is unresistable by normal creatures, but certain extremely powerful creatures may be immune to the effects.  Like the original version, once a Mana Burn ability has affected a target, no other mana burn abilities will be able to affect that target for the next minute.  Upgraded versions of the ability, Mana Blast and Mana Blaze, are available at level 65 and level 70 and use a maximum of 6000 and 9000 mana respectively.  The original Mana Burn ability has been refunded and can be repurchased by Wizards interested in the new version.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 13 February, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14929">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14929</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 13 16:30:17 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
