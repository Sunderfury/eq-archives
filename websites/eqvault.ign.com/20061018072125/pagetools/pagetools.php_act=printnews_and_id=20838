Slashdot.com's Michael Zenke has gone from "frustration and disappointment" with EQ to "I've seen the light."<br><br>After taking a tour with Rashere around the new expansion, his <a href="http://www.gametab.com/news/666320/">article</a> refers to the TSS expansion as "nothing less that a relaunch of EverQuest" and "EverQuest 1.5."<br><br>The main point of his article is that TSS is targeting players that subscribed in the past and will want to return given the content being released in just a couple of weeks.  Rather than focusing on a lot of new features for the game, they've concentrated on "focusing on the players," according to Zenke.  "SOE hopes that, by providing a clear quest path incorporating all of the innovations and upgrades the game has received since launch, players will be able to experience the best of what EQ has to offer," he explains.<br><br>I agree that TSS is a great idea, giving players another Kunark-type expansion, plus some time saving features and a new race to have fun with.  However, Zenke's comment, "SOE seems finally to have come around to the idea that they should be spending time and effort on the players," seems gratutious at best, since as an eight year veteran I have seen the SOE Team focus on the players since the game was launched, probably more than any other MMO out there.  The SOE Development Team has always listened to the players, steadily improving EQ and making it better every day.  But, if this new expansion brings back old players from where ever they wandered off to, that's fantastic.  The Progression server began the process, but a new player-oriented expansion on the current servers is even better.<br><br>If anyone can deliver "a love letter to the players," as Zenke puts it, it's the current SOE development team.  In my opinion, TSS is just another dozen roses in the on-going romance.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 2 September, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20838">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20838</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:21:27 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
