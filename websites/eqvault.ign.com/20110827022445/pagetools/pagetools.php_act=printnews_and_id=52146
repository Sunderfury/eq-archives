Be sure to follow the link to <a href="http://eqdev.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">the official post</a> as a great deal more is mentioned aside from the new server:<br><blockquote><i>We recently did a poll for a new server set through the in-game polling system. We have done many polls in the past through the webpage but there are plenty of players that play the game and don’t go to the webpage for information on it. We really wanted to get everyone who plays to cast a vote to accurately represent the players’ choice.<br><br>The winning server rule set was… 51/50 server!!!<br><br>We are pleased to see everyone cast their votes and can honestly say that we are very excited to see this server roll out to the EQ community. We are starting the work on getting the backend setup and ready to go, and will announce the details soon.</i> <sup><a href="http://eqdev.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Source</a></sup></blockquote></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 2 May, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=52146">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=52146</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 26 18:06:36 PDT 2011<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
