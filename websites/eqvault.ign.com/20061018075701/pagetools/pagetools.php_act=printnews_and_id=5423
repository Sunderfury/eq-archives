Overall I was impressed, but I usually am at press tours - if they don't impress you something is wrong!<br><br>Included with the preview are over 40 new, 1600x1200 screenshots that I took which show off the new areas, mobs, and interface features.<br><br>To read the full preview point your browser <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/static.php?page=donp">here</a>.  What do you think about the preview and Dragons of Norrath?
