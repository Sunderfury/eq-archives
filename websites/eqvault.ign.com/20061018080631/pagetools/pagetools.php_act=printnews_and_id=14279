Unfortunately you also need the 7 years worth of updated content and code that has been added to the game."<br><br>I imagine that patching seven years of the game would indeed take a while.<br><br>But we are glad to have new players!  Thanks for being persistent.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 19 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14279">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14279</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 1:06:33 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
