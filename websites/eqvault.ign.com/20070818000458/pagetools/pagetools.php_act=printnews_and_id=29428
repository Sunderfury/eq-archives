Would removing  them be game breaking?<br><br>Maddoc mentioned in the developer chat on May 15 that fizzles will not be removed from the game, and after extensive testing he assures the player base that the fizzle rate is steady at around 2% (although his actual number reported of 2.7714% is more like 3% in my book).<br><br>Player Aanelar <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=111791">argues</a> that fizzles are annoying and an archaic part of EverQuest, better consigned to "it seemed like a good idea at the time" dustbin.  Other players don't agree, and see it as balancing -- as must the devs, since they claim it is working as intended.<br><br>Read the arguments in the link above and decide for yourself!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 16 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29428">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29428</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 17 17:04:58 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
