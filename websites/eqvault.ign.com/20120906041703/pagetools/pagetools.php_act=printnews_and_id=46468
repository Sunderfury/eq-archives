You can't get this quest if you chose a different answer to his previous request.<br><br>You are completing the same number of quests, but it is a road block to doing all of them.  Chock it up to role playing, or following a story line!<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 21 Oct, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=46468">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=46468</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 21:17:03 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
