Perhaps you earned a title from winning a Best of the Best.  On May 14th, we will finally be opening the doors of The EverQuest Hall of Fame.  This will be a list of people who earned titles, artifacts, gotten items named after their characters from the Legends server and more.  Once the doors open, there will be information about how to get your character listed if you are missing from the initial list. This initial opening will be a news article but I hope to make major improvements to it as we go along and convert it into its own area of the site. "<br><br>No one has seen this yet as of today, but perhaps it will be there when the patch finishes.<br><br>Note that they are putting more "fun" into the Fan Faire:<br><br>"The Vegas Fan Faire should be a lot of Fun.  If you have been to a Fan Faire before, you'll see some changes made to this one.  We're increasing the fun level!  If you haven't been before, Vegas is a good starting point!"<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 16 May, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29417">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=29417</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 18 11:31:50 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
