Here's a clip from the full Q&A:<blockquote>EQ Vault: How many of the new zones will require access quests or flags to enter?<br><br>Robert Pfister: Players will be able to access all of the expansion zones without the need to undertake quests or earn flags. One zone won't be available when the expansion first opens, but players won't need to obtain flags to enter. A special event must take place before anyone can enter the zone. </blockquote>You can view the full Q&A <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/static.php?page=don">here</a>.
