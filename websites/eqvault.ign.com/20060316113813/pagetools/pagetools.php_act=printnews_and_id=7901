In addition, meeting the people who make EQ happen gives you a completely different perspective on the game-- trust me on this.  They are a very interesting and fun-to-be-around group of folks.<br><br>So check out the link on our Features menu and get over to Las Vegas!<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 25 May, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=7901">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=7901</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 3:38:13 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
