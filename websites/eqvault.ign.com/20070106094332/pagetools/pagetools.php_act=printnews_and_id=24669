His impression of how EverQuest is perceived by the playerbase is that it's a "hard" game to play and has a very specific target audience, but in general he thinks that MMOs in the future will become less specialized and appeal to a broader audience.<br><br>I take that to mean that he would like EQ to appeal to a broader base of players.<br><br>He also seems to be focused on overall game issues, and not single-player problems that come up.  For the producer, that's probably a good thing.<br><br>I wish him the best in his new position!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 22 Dec, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24669">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24669</a><br>Printed On: Sat Jan 6 1:43:32 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
