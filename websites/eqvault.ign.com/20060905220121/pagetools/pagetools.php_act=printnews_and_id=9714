We've done it a few times before and I think its time to do so again."<br><br><i>The Outcome of the War</i><br>Apparently, the trolls regain their home in the war, but that's a spoiler since that hasn't happened yet.........AbsorEQ: "The Frogloks will have a new place to live. It will be less, um, stony than Gukta, but it probably won't be lavish. Honestly, if you've seen Grobb you'd have to wonder why anyone would purposefully live there.  Oh, as a side note, those events were not meant to lead up to the expansion, it was unrelated."<br><br><i>Cultural Armor</i>:<br>"Right now, we have four sets of the base cultural armor (20, 40, 60, and 70), which covers a pretty good range of players as it is. I don't have any plans to introduce any more base cultural armor, unless a level-cap increase were to occur."<br><br>Maddoc: "There is a lot of room to grow on that armor, specifically relating to the type-12 augments, which you may see some new variations of in the near future."<br><br><i>Endurance Regeneration</i><br>Rashere: "We've been seeing a lot of concern lately about the amount of time it can take to regen to full from nothing at the top end of the game. While we don't have a solution at the moment, we are looking into ways to make it take less time without being unbalancing while in a combat situation.  We are still working on the itemization for the expansion. At the moment, we aren't planning to add endurance regen to items, but we are still evaluating it and that might change."  <br><br><br><b>Depths of Darkhollow Expansion</b><br><br><i>Expansion Details</i><br>"Depths of Darkhollow is really exploring an area of Norrath that has been around for ages and has affected the surface in more ways than you think. You'll come across some lore points which will tie directly into things you've seen in the past. Also, because of the way monster missions work, we are really able to let players live through lore that we had to just tell them through stories and books in the past. I think the lore for this expansion is some of the deepest and most compelling we've done to date.<br><br>While there aren't any full city zones, there are a few city areas in the new zones. Some of the NPCs will start off liking you while you'll have to earn the trust of others before you can use their city.<br><br>Right now, the plan is to have a DoD tab with a selection of AAs. There may be othe hidden AAs like we've done in the past, but the majority of AAs will come in a more traditional manner.<br><br>There are no plans to introduce a new race, but we will be releasing a clockwork boar as a mount. The mount is available via retail purchase only."<br><br><i>Levels of Play</i><br>Rashere: "The actual Depths of Darkhollow zones start at around level 45 and work their way up from there. Because of the way monster missions work, though, your level is pretty irrelevant to do them. We've created several monster missions that take place in old world zones and are available to players of any level."<br><br>"There's a significant number of raids aimed at players who have tackled Anguish already. While the actual numbers aren't public information yet, I think you'll be pleased when you see what we have in store."<br><br><i>Missions</i><br>Rashere: "We aren't using a point based system for Depths of Darkhollow. Instead, we're focusing on making the missions more like traditional quests so there are rewards based on the mission you are doing. It will work slightly differently than what you are used to, though, as you will get a reward the first time you complete a mission in addition to the normal drops within the zone.<br><br>One of the things we tried to do with DoD is create progressive missions. So, there are actually several different progression lines that you can do to get various rewards. Some missions take place in instanced versions of the base zone while others take place in their own special zones."<br><br><i>Spirit Shrouds and Playing a Monster</i><br>Rashere: "There are two distinct forms of playing as a monster. Spirit Shrouds will allow you to play through any zone in EQ that you would normally have access to and any experience or items you pick up will be able to transfer back to your main character. Spirit Shrouds take on many different forms, including the classes you mention [healer or tank type]. Each Shroud will have a variety of abilities and tend to be much more focused than a player of that actual class.<br><br>Monster missions are much more focused and have you playing as a monster through a very specific mission, for instance reliving a piece of Norrathian history from the eyes of the people who were there at the time.  While on those missions, you will also be able to earn rewards that transfer back to your main character including items and experience.<br><br>*Loral*: "Will a mix of level-ranged players be all able to do a single monster mission together? Can a level 70, level 56, level 40, and level 25 all group together for a monster mission?" Rashere: "They sure can. The rewards they receive will scale based on their main character's level."<br><br><br><i>Intelligent Items</i><br>Maddoc : "Intelligent" items will have a lot of personality, many of which may vary. They might be cowardly or heroic, persuasive of mocking, though they won't directly refuse to attack specific types of NPC's."<br><br>Rashere: 'I don't want to give an example of a true item since I'd rather they be a surprise, but you can expect items that cheer you on when you get a kill, items that berate you when you let a party member die, and items that cry out to your friends to take it away from you when you die because you're not worthy of wielding it. Intelligent items can react to a large variety of circumstances and they will each have their own personality. Some will be helpful, some plain rude.<br><br>There's no current plan to convert existing items into "intelligent" items. The items that have this new ability will be found in the Depths of Darkhollow.<br><br>"Intelligent" items can be obtained through the standard means, such as Tradeskills, Quests, and killing NPC's. "Intelligent" items will level up through killing NPC's.<br><br>"Intelligent" items must be equipped to be able to gain experience."</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 29 July, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9714">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9714</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 5 15:01:16 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
