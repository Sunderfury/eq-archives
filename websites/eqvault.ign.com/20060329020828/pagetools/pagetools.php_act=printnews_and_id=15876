You'll get an extra day of double-exp out of it.<br><br>The patch will take place at 5am tomorrow, should take three hours.  An in-game message will go out shortly.<br><br>Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you all.  Hopefully another day of double-exp will make up for it some."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 17 March, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15876">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15876</a><br>Printed On: Tue Mar 28 18:08:28 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
