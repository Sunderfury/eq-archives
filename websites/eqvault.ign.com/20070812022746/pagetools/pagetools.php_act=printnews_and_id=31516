Pirates of the Burning Sea, Vangard, EQ2's Rise of Kunark, A super cool Rome game called "Gods and Heroes", the Pirate Card game thingie, and some Online Poker deal.... all the games were being displayed and shown off, except EQ.. which was broken.   I chuckled a little as Zajeer was working on it, and he finally got everything working and showed off what they had of SoF zones.   No NPC's or anything, but just the zones and a vision.... <br><br>People say a lot of things about Zajeer, but there are some truths... he's easily the best salesperson on the dev team, he really loves his product and definitely has a vision of what's to come, and the ability to share that with others.   The zones are literally stunning... basically, it all started with a tour of the revamped Steamfont, which is ... if I can compare it to other zone revamps... like the 2nd revision of Nektulos... basically everything is in the same place, just looking a ton better.   The "fonts of steam" look good, the windmills look great, the entrance to Ak'Anon looks like what they were envisioning when they created Ak'Anon... an industrio-mechanical place.<br><br>The next "zone" was seriously fantastic.  There is a giant 300 foot clockwork which walks around... and you can get inside (if you have the instance), yes, the zoneline moves around the zone in which it walks around.   It's a mechanical masterpiece and has level after level of cool mechanical products, you can make your way all the way up to the top which is inside the head, where you actually see the eyes from the inside... it's really neat.<br><br>Another zone we got a chance to preview was the rendition of "Sleeper's Tomb 2.0", which is enormous, appears to be a raid zone with tons of content, locked doors, all the way to Kerafyrm's lair.  This zone is very impressive, with the "feel" of Sleeper's Tomb, but much, much larger, and with what looks to be a ton of content.  <br><br>Tnexus-Prexus had this to report:<br><br>-- The expansion has 15 static zones and 6 instanced zones. Some of the static zones may also be instanced for raid content, etc. <br>-- The level increase is going to level 80 <br>-- The expansion is primarily geared for levels 70-80. This means a huge boom of content for players at the level cap. <br>-- SoF features two seperate, but intertwined storylines. The first is based on Meldrath the Magnificent who basically raises a castle from the ground up in Steamfont, and the second is based on Kerafyrm. Meldrath's encounters are around Solteris level and must be beaten before you can do the Kerafyrm arc. <br>-- Kerafyrm is getting a new model though it wasn't available for viewing/hadn't been made yet. <br>-- Interactive objects and interactivity with other PCs will be having an important role in some of the content. (More on this later.) <br>-- Brownies and Minotaurs are getting new models <br>-- Steamfont is getting revamped, but no other Faydwer zones are... yet. <br>-- There will be a clockwork dragon. -- New AAs and Spells though nothing released yet. <br>-- Beta will hopefully start in 2-3 weeks if all goes well. <br>(Edited due to blunder) -- There are new models for an existing race in the works, but don't expect it to be out in time for the expansion. As for what it is, Zajeer couldn't tell me. (NOT a new race.)<br><br>Here are some of the pictures I took. Unfortunately, due to location of the monitor and the time of day, there's a glare on some of the pictures. Also, some of the pictures are obviously blurry. Most of that is because the character was moving around. You should still be able to see the pictures pretty well though. Zajeer showed us 10 zones. Some I got more details about than others, but I explain what I know about each. Some of the spellings of these may be off also.   <br><br>Hills of Shade- A largely undead plains. Paladins, Necros, and Clerics rejoice at this zone as you'll be able to kill undead elfs, humans, and many more mobs. Also will be lore about the creation of the Half-Elves from this zone. <br>Guardian- Guardian is basically a giant robot that broke free from Meldrath's castle. He'll be roaming around in a static zone. To enter him, you have to get stepped on basically. You'll be prompted if you'd like to zone. If you don't answer in time, you get squished and die. The goal in this zone (which I believe is instanced) is to shut him down. And instead of beating up NPCs, you'll have to destroy parts inside him while being attacked from NPCs. It's a really big zone also for what it is. <br>Mechanutius- This is an outside zone that has slingshots. In certain zones you'll be traveling by slingshot to get to different areas. <br>Meldrath's Mansion- This is the endzone for the first story arc of the expansion where you'll encounter Meldrath. Inside you'll find minotaurs, crypts for when he's messing around with Necromancy, and of course, plenty of clockwork related encounters. <br>Crystallus- Crystallus is the endzone for the expansion, and the current resting spot for Kerafyrm. The whole zone is covered with a prismatic sheen that was created when Kerafyrm first breathed into the area. Inside the zone is a giant statue of him also. He's guarded by the many prismatic creatures he's created. There's also a spot with eggs and a broodmother. He's guarded by 4 elemental dragons that must be killed to unlock his room. <br>Bloodmoon- One word sold me on this zone, Were-Orcs. The lore goes that something happens to the Orc Shamans from the Darkhollows when they come up to land. We didn't get to see any pictures, but they sound awesome. <br>Shipwork Docks- Zajeer didn't have too much information on this zone, but it looks pretty <br>Steamfactory- The building place of clockwork and clockwork things, this zone uses object interactivity. One example Zajeer gave me was of 2 characters tethering. The goal is to turn on these fans, but in doing so you're flung out the airlock. However, in tethering to another person, the second person who is beside the fan can swing the other person around and away from the fan instead of being blown off once he or she turns it on. Pretty cool huh? There's also a part (I'm not 100% sure if it was in this zone) where you have to avoid getting hit by an object. These objects can knock you down a pit where you'll die. <br>Dragonscale- Crystallus is off this zone. Don't have too much other info on this one, but look at the pics anyway. <br>Loping Plains- Don't have too much info, but look at the pics.   </span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 30 Jul, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31516">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31516</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 11 19:27:46 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
