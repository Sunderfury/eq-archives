I have not agreed with some of the design decisions SOE has made with some of their games. Some of them are not what I would have done (while others are). This is simple disagreement in terms of philosophy. This doesn't make me dislike anyone, or think poorly of anyone.<br><br>2. I think SOE has made good games since I left. Again, I would have perhaps made them somewhat different had I remained there, but that doesn't make their games not good. If you guys don't like them, or how they've changed, then that's fine too. It's all about choice. And in this case, since we retain creative control over Vanguard, not only are there more choices, but there is no danger of Vanguard being changed into something else (or, for that matter, EQ 2 being changed into something else because of Sigil).<br><br>3. Many people at SOE are my personal friends, including Smed, who is one of my best friends. If some of you are so filled with hate that you are going to just insult people, some of whom are my friends, then Nick and other moderators are going to intervene and I am not going to answer questions from people who include hate in their posts.<br><br>4. I am very excited about the opportunity to work with many of my old friends again and think that Vanguard brings a lot to the suite of games they already have, but is also a very different game. So this helps SOE.<br><br>5. I think SOE hosts games very well -- perhaps the best out there. I know Vanguard will be taken care of in terms of operations and support at SOE. So this, combined with an opportunity to work with old friends, combined with the opportunity for Sigil to become a co-publisher is a HUGE opportunity and good for Sigil."<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 8 May, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17304">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17304</a><br>Printed On: Sat May 27 5:56:31 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
