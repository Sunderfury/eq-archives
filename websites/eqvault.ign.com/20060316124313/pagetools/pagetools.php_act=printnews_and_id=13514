Baelish has posted some <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=eqplayers&message.id=1083">known issues and general information</a> about the service on the EQLive website.<br><br>Greg "Baelish" explains: "As a general note, once again I'd like to re-iterate if your character is not showing correct information please run the /eqplayersupdate command, give it an hour or so and then if you still have issues please email us.<br> <br>Also, another reminder that EverQuest has NO database as a game.  The tools to collect the hundreds of files, run the game logic against them to then generate the information we display is very complex.  The game team and web team have tried hard to ensure accuracy, but it's entirely possible that there are small things that aren't quite right.  If you let us know about them (you have a lot more eyes than we do!) we'll be sure to get them straightened out.<br> <br>As always if you have anything you consider a bug or feedback for how we can make the service better please email eqplayersqa@soe.sony.com."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 17 December, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13514">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13514</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:43:13 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
