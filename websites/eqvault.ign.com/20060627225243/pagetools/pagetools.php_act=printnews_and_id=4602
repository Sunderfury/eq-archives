Looking like things are going to get interesting.  Here's a clip:<blockquote>We have begun the process by looking into group roles.  We plan to take a look at raid roles after we have finished with groups.  We are looking at what each class has to offer in a group setting, how useful and viable that role is and finally, how well they perform these duties.  The team is currently reviewing extensive data from live servers to make sure that the conclusions we make are as accurate as possible.  Once we have data that we can share, we will ask for your input and insight on our conclusions. </blockquote><br>This should be really fun to watch these changes happen.  Compared to other games classes in EQ are pretty well balanaced, but as everyone knows, improvement can always happen.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 6 January, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4602">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4602</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 27 15:52:43 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
