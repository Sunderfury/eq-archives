Are those going to be more cosmetic, or will they have stats attached to them?<br><br>Smedley: They have some minor stats, but they’re primarily cosmetic. That’s the intent, for them to be cosmetic. We have some minor potions and stuff in there, but otherwise no. Our aim is to give a lot more loot with these things, let me give you some examples. In EverQuest, we’ve got a Shadow Panther, or a Snow Leopard, or a Mystical Krinn, or maybe a Seething Chimera, and then there’s some potion packs. These are simple potions, they’re not meant to be a big game advantage, nothing like that. There’s a lot of different things, like different coloured baubles that are available in the rest of the game. We want to give stuff, similar to the way that World of Warcraft is doing it, that’s cool looking but not very ‘game enhancing’.<br><br>One other thing to note is that we’re doing loot drops in the game, of cards. If you don’t want to you don’t have to buy a darn thing if you don’t want to. If you want, you can just go out there and kill monsters, and actually get cards that you can use to play in the game. They’re just booster packs, just drops of a booster pack, so you don’t have to buy a thing. You’re going to have to work for it, but the reality is that if you don’t want to spend the money you don’t have to.<br><br>MN: Is that going to be a fairly common drop?<br><br>Smedley: It’s definitely not going to be common, but the idea is that if a person doesn’t have a lot of money but still wants to play, he can spend time in-game to get cards rather than buying them.<br><br>MN: Are the booster packs going to be sellable via the in-game economy?<br><br>Smedley: Actually no. One of the things we’re doing is making it so that you can’t sell any of these cards. That would be problematic for us. There would be some legal issues around that.<br><br>MN: Will players be able to trade?<br><br>Smedley: No. Otherwise we’ll get into a situation where the gold sellers will get into this, and we’re going to stop that cold.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 4 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31720">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31720</a><br>Printed On: Sun Aug 12 3:04:46 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
