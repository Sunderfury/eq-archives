 <p><b>Welcome to the Cazic ThuleServer Guild List!<br>
   Cazic Thule merged with Brell Serillis.</b>  </p>
 <p> Updated on August 28, 2006 </p>
 <p>

The information posted here is taken directly from each guild's website.  For
  more information about how to join any particular guild on the list, visit
  their website. Almost all guilds have a recruitment thread on their forums
  with more information about who to contact in game and specific class requirements,
  if any.
<p>
<a href="http://www.alariusofbrell.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Alarius</strong></a><br>
Alarius has basic requirements that all players must meet before submitting an application.   If you do not meet these   requirements feel free to contact a recruiter about joining us on open raid nights.</p>
<p> A. You must be level 70</p>
<p> B. 500 AAs are required to apply to an open class.  700 AAs are required to apply to a closed class</p>
<p> C. You must have the Anguish signet quest done.  You must have Dread Spire access.  You must have ToB.    Applicants who apply without these keys finished will have their apps closed.    </p>
<p>D. You must be able to do the following :Shrink, Invis, Levi, EB  You must also have at least 2 right   click items (i.e. 8th Coldain ring, Shuriken Goblin Skull Earring, AoN, etc)    </p>
<p>E. Alarius raids 4 nights a week, Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, between 9:00 pm and 12:00pm Pacific   Standard Time (West Coast of the United States).  You must keep your raid attendance above 75% or you will be   removed from recruitment.  If you cannot commit to this schedule please don't apply.    F. Alarius has an excellent reputation for skill and fair play, we are  intolerant of any behavior that reflects   negatively on us, including but not limited to harassment, stalking, kill stealing, camp jumping, or any other action that strays   from our tenets of honorable skilled play. There are few second chances offered to players who violate this policy.    </p>
<p>G. Alarius is a group of tight knit friends who realize that real life is important. We raid less hours than most   guilds believing that quality is better than quantity.  We are always striving to do more with less.  Time will tell   if we are a good fit for each other. </p>

  7.) You need to have a strong knowledge of your class and the gear,   spells, and AA you use. <BR>
  <BR>
  8.) All of the above, along with your   personality and how well you mesh with our existing members will determine how   quickly you are tagged, and if you will become a full member. <BR>
</p>
<p><a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/bhandofchaos" target="_blank"><strong>Hand of Chaos</strong></a><br>
  The Hand of Chaos is not a full time raiding guild. We don&rsquo;t have 60+ level   requirements for membership, mandatory attendance on raids, or a thirst to be   the biggest/strongest/uber&rsquo;est guild on the Server. We don&rsquo;t want to raid every   night, we don&rsquo;t want to be outfitted with the very best gear, and we don&rsquo;t need   to play the end game. We do want to keep our circle of close friends together.   We do want to face new challenges. We do want to get our epics, kill dragons,   and raid planes. We do want to play as far into the end game as possible. We   want to have fun, as do the uber guilds, without losing our own identity and   style of play.<BR>
  <BR>
  The HOC style of play is important to understand. We do   like raiding, but don&rsquo;t have the appetite of the uber guilds. The guild will   rarely if ever require your attendance at a raid or function. The guild does not   see itself as a tool to help others outfit their characters, so they can join an   uber guild. The guild does see it self as a tool to help its members achieve   personal goals. If this style of play (remember, we are talking about a game)   does not fit yours, HOC may not be the guild for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://hellfire.guildwizard.com/index.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>Hellfire
Club</strong><br>
</a>Hellfire Club is first and foremost a raiding guild. As such, most events hosted   by the guild will be raid orientated, apart from obvious exceptions related to   the release of a new expansion or similar. Despite being a higher end guild,   most of our members occupy a full time job in addition to playing everquest,   thus raiding hours are suited to fit an ordinary work schedule. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How do we do this? <BR>
<BR>
We Raid on   Wednesday and Friday from 8 PM EST till we are finished, also Saturday and   Sundays between 1 PM EST till we are Finished. Weekend raids are normally the   bigger scale events. These Nights out of the week can and do often change with   the possibility of commencing earlier, and longer duration raids as we feel is   needed. These raids cover Oow, GoD, DoN and player improvement. <BR>
<BR>
Hellfire   Club is not trying to be the First or the Fastest. We are however seeking to   experience the joys of Everquest on a schedule that is realistic for the working   player. We understand that not everyone can commit to 6-7 Days a week of   Mandatory 60% raid attendance or risk being cut from the higher end guilds. We   understand that Real-Life takes priority over a game. We are proof positive that   progression can be accomplished with a working schedule. <BR>
<BR>
We will still   see the upper end content through teamwork, dedication and commitment and not   live behind our PC's. This guild is clearly not for everyone. <BR>
<BR>
HFC is on   a limited schedule and we do enforce a 45% raid attendance policy. If online,   everyone is required to attend raids. We do understand that IRL issues arise so   we communicate on these occasions. <BR>
<BR>
Where we are: <BR>
Our   current position progression wise is as follows; <BR>
We have completed the   Planes of Power expansion. <BR>
GoD: Ikkinz Trials 1/2/3/4. Uqua . Qvic,   Inktu`Ta, and Txevu defeated. Tacvi cleared. <BR>
DoN: Rikkikun, Kessadonna,   Yar'Lir, Vishimtar defeated. <BR>
OoW: All MPG Trials defeated <BR>
Riftseekers:   King and Queen , Chailak, Feratha defeated <BR>
Anguish: Keldovan the Harrier,   Ture, Jelvan, Warden Hanvar and Arch Magus Vangl defeated <BR>
DoD: Matriarch   Shyra , Bloodeye, Council of the Nine defeated. <BR>
<BR>
Our primary raiding   focus consists of farming Anguish, MPG trials, DoN dragons, Tacvi and the push   to Demi Plane.</p>

  We are   actively pursuing PoP content, with our sights set on GoD/DoN/OoW content in the   future. We do not require anyone to raid, however we will heavily encourage it.   Currently we plan to raid Wednesday and Sunday   nights starting at 7pm CST. <BR>
  <BR>
  We are not an alt parking service, so   if your character is inactive for over a month you will be removed. Also, if the   Officers determine that you are simply using the Guild for port/pool services   you will be removed. A Leave of Absence request may prevent this, be sure to   file one if you will be away for an extended period of time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.poisonarrow.org/forum/" target="_blank"><strong>Poison Arrow</strong></a><br>
  "So you want to join Poison Arrow? Believe it or not, we do actually guild
  people, we just do so very slowly. If you want to join us you must have a great
  amount of patience. Our guild is not built upon the the best class balance
  possible, we're not geared for racing towards the end game. When we add someone
  to the guild, we are not guilding that character, we're guilding the person
playing that character. We don't say you must attend X-many raids and we'll guild
  you. We don't say you must obtain X-many members of PA as sponsors before you
  can
join. We don't have a minimum level to join. However, the vast majority of PA
  members are 70, so it does make it a bit more difficult for lower level characters
  to
get real involved with us. By no means are we easy to join, the process can take
  several months in fact. We examine you, you examine us, thats what its all
  about. We'd much rather
  find out whether you're right for us before we guild you, just as I'm sure
you'd rather find out if we're right for you before you get invited. Seem reasonable?
  So, post if you're interested, if you want to talk to anyone in game, go for
it! Guild Leader: Arathena; Officers: Kaelee, Qualous."</p>

<p><a href="http://roninofbrell.net/modules/news/" target="_blank"><strong>Ronin of Brell</strong></a><br>
  Ideals of the Guild <br>
  1. First and Foremost we are a guild that is comprised of players that just
  like to play the game to have fun. <br>
  2. Ronin Of Brell is a guild that is strict about players conduct in game.
  We don't tolerate rude players and adhere to the policies as set out in our
  bylaws. <br>
  3. The officers in the guild and the guild leaders are always accessible to
  anyone and any complaints, disputes, requests, etc. can be brought to them
  and will be handled in a timely fashion. We always welcome new ideas and opinions. <br>
  4. All open raids and dungeon crawls we gladly welcome anyone who wants to
  come weather they are in guild or not. We encourage interaction between other
  guilds and will always try to make room for whoever wants to show up. Some
  items may be claimed before the raid starts. All other loot is handled CAWU. <br>
  5. We have a tradition of grouping together and many feel this is better than
  pickup exp groups. This way you get to know your mates in the guild and not
  just by the chat channel. <br>
  6. Ronin Of Brell members are willing to help other members in the guild. This
  being with corpse recoveries, ports, rezzes, epics etc. <br>
7. Ronin Of Brell is a Mains Guild. </p>
<p>Recruiting Process<br>
  1. Character that shows interest must post on boards at the apply here link
  located on Roninofbrell.net<br>
  2. Applicant will join the recruit channel in game. (This will be given in
  game)<br>

4. Character must be of the 46th lvl or greater and be your Main Character.</p>
<p><a href="http://secrecy.crystallized.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Secrecy</strong></a><br>
  The level requirement for the guild is 70, and the AA requirement is 100AA's. If   you are lower than 70/100AA's, you may still apply. You will be allowed to raid   with us, and get gimped into the zones we raid in, however, you will not be   invited to the guild unless you meet the level/AA requirement and KT flag   requirement. There is a small exception to this. If you are an exceptional   player who makes almost 100% of the raids, you may (at guild leader's   discretion) be invited to the guild. <BR>
  <BR>
  Raid Attendance Requirements <BR>
  We raid 4 nights a week, Monday through Thursday starting at 9pm   Pacific (For those of you who don't know time zones, that's 10pm Mountain, 11pm   Central and Midnight Eastern). Raids generally last 3-4 hours and rarely go   longer. We are mostly a west coast guild and many members attend 80%-100% of the   raids. We understand real life can take it's toll on your raid attendance. At   the present time, you are required to attend 75% of the raids, that's 3 raids a   week. Raid attendance is tracked on the DKP site using the "Raider Stats" link   at the top of the DKP page. You must be at or above a 75 to stay in the guild,   anything less than that and you "may" be disbanded unless your absence is   authorized. Most reasons for absence will be accepted (we know it's a game) but   we do require that you notify an officer or post your intended absence on the   website. If you have a pattern that keeps you from meeting the 75% requirement,   even with excused absences, you may still be removed from the guild. We   understand that real life is always first, but if your real life issues   constantly prevent you from reaching the guild minimum, then this just isn't the   guild for you at this time. Remember, you are applying to a guild that raids   very heavily. If you can't make at least 3 raids a week on time and also stay   for the entire duration, don't apply.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.veterancrew.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Veteran Crew</strong></a><br>
  VC is a DKP based, old guild originally from Brell Serilis. We are a highly   skilled, adaptive, tight knit, generally more mature family guild that seeks   to balance 2-3 evenings of serious raiding with several <BR>
  nights of loosely   structured free time for people to spend time with friends and family. <BR>
  <BR>
  We are strategy heavy. We don't zerg and may die often figuring out new encounters, but we win eventually with brain AND brawn and pride ourselves on this. Having a healthy sense of humor helps when grouping with us. We like to have fun, but don't tolerate assclowns. (except our <BR>
  Glorious Guild Originator, All Hail Pyrenn, Grand Poohbah - Praised be his trains...LOADING....PLEASE WAIT) <BR>
  <BR>
  What we are looking for? <BR>
  We are   looking for intelligent people who can play the game and their chosen class   at a level well above average. We want team players we can depend on and   people who don't use the anonymity of the internet as an excuse for   dishonorable play. We want people whose play schedules mesh <BR>
  with the   majority of current members and most importantly, a good attitude.   Seriously. We look at a persons temperament, ability to follow instructions,   get along with others and both give and take constructive criticism to and   from others with tact. While having 5,000 AA's, a <BR>
  magelo profile packed with   a +47 Breastplate of No0b-Pwnz, flagged all the way up to Uberzone_B,   Borg-like instant-recall game lore knowledge is impressive and will get you   accolades from the general population of Norrath, we look beyond that. Solid   ethics, generosity, willingness to <BR>
  help others, and sacrifice and other   notable good karma traits are what we are looking for and will notice.   Guildhoppers only willing to get what loot/flags they want and bail need not   apply. We are not Epics-R-Us regardless of how trivial those encounters have   become or backflaggers for every alternate on the server. Most of us share a   one for all, all for one mentality and will gladly come to the aid of any   guildmate, but do not waste our time. Anyone given a VC guild tag must be   able to fit in with our hybrid family-raiding guild style.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.eqwatchers.com/" target="_blank">Watchers</a></strong><br>
  WATCHERS CURRENTLY HAS ROOM FOR 5-10 <STRONG>DEDICATED RAIDERS</STRONG>,</p>
<p>LOOK US UP GET IN ON SOME RAIDS , MONDAY AND FRIDAY ARE THE BEST DAYS FOR   TAGGING ALONG , BUT THERE IS SOME ROOM ON OTHER NIGHTS</p>
<p><STRONG>Desirability:<BR>
  </STRONG><EM>High</EM>: cleric,   shaman<BR>
  <EM>Moderate</EM>: wizard, mage, bard<BR>
  <EM>Low:</EM> Everything   else<BR>
  If you find yourself in the &ldquo;Low&rdquo; category then don&rsquo;t immediately   discount us. Desirability is a fluctuating thing and we are always interested in   exceptional players of any class. It especially helps to have a number of people   in the guild vouch for your play abilities.</p>
<p>We currently have a good core group of 50-70 people who regularly raid with   us. As most content is limited to 54 the current recruitment opportunities are   very limited.</p>
<p>We will only be considering exceptional recruits that are recommended by   members. Thanks for your interest, but it&rsquo;s just no fun to recruit and be   excluded from every 54 person raid we conduct.</p>
<p><STRONG>Play Time and Consistency: </STRONG></p>
<p>You must be very active, Our raids are based around 7:00pm to 12:00am EST   game play, and we raid six days a week Monday through Saturday. Consistent   playtime around that area is essential. If you cannot make at least 3- 4 full   raids per week your recruitment is not likely to be successful.</p>
<p><STRONG>Keys/Flags: </STRONG><STRONG>Required level:</STRONG></p>
<p>The required level for classes is 70. You must have at least a basic level of   300 AA appropriately spent (see the list in joining on the message board) and   preferably 400+ AA spent. If you are lower than this, do not give up hope, you   can still group with us, and learn about us, to see if we are the family you   truly want to hold the title of. However, to be a properly contributing member   of the guild, you&rsquo;ll need to have a solid level of AA &amp; regular XP. Be ready   to put in the work to catch up to where you should be.</p>
