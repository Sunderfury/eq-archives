There is an experience multiplier in each zone that can be set to any value we want. That multiplier is applied to the experience you get when killing a creature.<br><br>For example:<br><br>Say you kill a blue con. That blue con is worth, say, 100 exp to you.<br><br>If the Zone Experience Modifier is .5 in that zone you will get 50 experience from that kill.<br>If the Zone Experience Modifier is 1.5 in that zone you will get 150 experience from that kill.<br><br>When we designate a zone a Hot Zone we temporarily raise that multiplier. Something to keep in mind is that while the multiplier is higher in that zone relative to what it was before that doesn't mean it's the very highest in the game. Just that it's higher than it used to be.<br><br>Finally the Modifier is applied to all kills that give experience. You don't have to be a certain level to see the bonus. The level ranges are simply provides so you can have a level 34 character, look at the list, and decide which zone looks about right for your level.<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 14 Jun, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18340">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18340</a><br>Printed On: Tue Aug 14 8:36:19 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
