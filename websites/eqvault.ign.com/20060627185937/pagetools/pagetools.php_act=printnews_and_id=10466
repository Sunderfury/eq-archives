Click on the links and you will see many of your server's guild recruiting requirements and a link to each of their websites.<br><br>How does this work for you?<br><br> --if you are considering another guild or joining a guild, easily see what guilds might suit you best and if you meet the requirements for a particular guild without clicking back and forth to many different websites.<br><br>--if you are a guild leader, see what other guilds post in terms of rules, recruitment policies, and other information.<br><br>--new to the game and thinking about joining a guild? Find out what it takes both in character progession (gear, AA's, etc.) and behavior to join a guild.  Not every guild is right for every person, so investigating what different guilds are about before you apply is a very good idea.<br><br>--wonder what you should be looking toward for your personal character goals?  The high level guilds all have class requirements, and you can use those AA, gear and resists requirements to plan your own progression!<br><br>--see what guilds are doing on your server and how many are playing in the end game content.
