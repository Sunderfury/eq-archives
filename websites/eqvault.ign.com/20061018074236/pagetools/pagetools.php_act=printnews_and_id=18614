This will give players some more options for where they can go to gain experience, although newer zones will naturally still have the higher level NPCs and better item drops so will still see the majority of players"<br><br>and a hint about where the next expansion might be going:<br><br>"A new version of Nektulos Forest will be going out with the next live update [this interview was obviously conducted before the last patch, since Nek has been revamped]. After that, we'll likely continue working on zones in that area, so Commons would make the most sense for the next one"<br><br>and finally a guestimate about how long it will take players to get through the Progression server content:<br><br>"...we'd have to say the minimum amount of time is going to be about a year, and that's just based on the fact that players tend to surprise us quite often. We really expect it to take longer than that."<br><br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 22 June, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18614">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18614</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:42:38 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
