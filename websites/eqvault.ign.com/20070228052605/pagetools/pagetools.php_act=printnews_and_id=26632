There are two teleporters inside the library/temple in the center of the city, two more portals in the Sanctum area, 4 portals in the Inner circle, and 8 sets of 3 portals each in the Outer circle. Also, part of the sets in the Outer circle are 4 special portals that take you to the 4 habitats, Jewel of Atiiki, Thalassius, Zhisza and Silyssar.<br><br>In order to be able to use these teleporters you must first complete a number of quests to attune the portals to yourself. These quests are given by Archarcanist Kirstmycl at the southwest portal in the Sanctum. The quests ask you to visit certain portals and collect keys from them. The keys will spawn on your cursor when you step on those portals. Be aware though! You may get ambushed at some of the portals.<br><br>Each portal (or set of portals) has a unique symbol attached to it. <br>Navigating from portal to portal is done by clicking or stepping on the symbols on the teleportation platform. (The exception are the portals in the temple, which aren’t a platform but rather a tube of spinning rings) <br>Not all portals are directly connected to each other, so you may need to use 2 or 3 portals to reach your destination, depending on where you want to go."<br><br>Thank you Kumbaja for posting this helpful guide!
