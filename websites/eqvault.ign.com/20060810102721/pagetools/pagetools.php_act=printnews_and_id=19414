Players have completed the steps to opening the Kunark expansion, killed Nagafen numerous times now, and are just waiting for the developers to open up Kunark.   I understand that the target date for opening the Kunark expansion is July 28.<br><br>Already there are complaints from the more casual and slower-leveling players that things are happening too fast, but EQ players have never held back from a challenge and it's to be expected that things would end up this way.<br><br>Given a task to complete, such as defeating boss mobs or solving quests to open up each expansion, what else could happen but a mad dash to be first on the server?  That's the nature of the EQ player -- the game has always been about challenges and overcoming difficulty, and that's what EQ players love about it.  The reward is character progression and for those elite few, name recongnition as being one of the best players or a member of a top guild.<br><br>EQ has the unique quality of being a game that is not only challenging, but rewards players who employ effective playing strategies and understand how to get the most out of each class both individually and as a team.  Leadership, persistence, networking with other players, and good strategizing is rewarded in this game.   The Progression servers bear this out.<br><br>I will say that I am still dawdling under level 10, and there seems to be no problem getting a group on the Combine, at least.  The lower level population still seems very strong and even as new people move up, others start characters which keep the lower level zones full.  Unlike the regular servers, it is still fairly difficult to twink a character and move up quickly.  Undeniably, the camaraderie and social aspects of the game at the lower levels is flourishing, which is very much what the progression server idea was about. <br><br>When the servers opened, no one thought that we could go back to the time when everything was unknown.  That's not what these servers are about, anyway.  They are about adding a more difficult dimension to content that has long been deserted by the majority of the playerbase.  Many people I have grouped with never even saw that content when they started.  Now, they are enjoying trains in Crushbone and soon Kunark Castle.  That's what is good about the Progression servers:  enjoying old content made interesting again, enjoying the chatter of 100 people in a newbie zone, and facing the challenges of progressing without all the help of newbie armor, PoK ports, and high level buffs.<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 17 July, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19414">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19414</a><br>Printed On: Thu Aug 10 3:27:21 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
