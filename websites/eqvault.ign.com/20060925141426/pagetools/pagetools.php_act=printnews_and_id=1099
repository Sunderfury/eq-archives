This round we have a new Mage and Druid ability.<blockquote><br><b>Druid</b><br><i>Call of the Wild</i> - This ability allows you to call a fallen<br>comrade's spirit back to their corpse.  This resurrection does not<br>restore any lost experience, but the player can still get an experience<br>resurrection after being affected by this ability. <br><br><b>Magician</b><br><i>Heart of Stone</i> - This ability will allow you to turn into an<br>embodiment of elemental earth, greatly reducing the damage you take from<br>melee attacks. <br></blockquote><br>The Magician ability sounds a lot like the last druid ability we posted.  Seems many classes are getting a "get out of jail free" spell this time around.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 27 August, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=1099">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=1099</a><br>Printed On: Mon Sep 25 7:14:26 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
