But the newest expansion for <i>Legends of Norrath</i> also brings some new, "freshman" keywords into the mix.</p> <p>The first is <b>Attuned</b>, and it's all about faction (as some of you might expect from a set that continues playing around with faction). Attuned simply means, "this card's faction is the same as your avatar's." Note that because the text on cards doesn't take effect until you actually play them, an Attuned card "defaults" to neutral when it's in your hand, discard pile, or deck. But once you play it, if you're shadow, so is it. If you're light, so is it.</p><br><a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=51273">Read the rest</a> and view the purty pictures!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 7 Feb, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=49858">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=49858</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 20:49:05 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
