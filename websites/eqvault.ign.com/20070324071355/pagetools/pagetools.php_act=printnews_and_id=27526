I honestly believe that the original concept of EQ was created to provide a game that the developers wanted to play. It didn’t have as much to do with Ultima Online or other MMO titles that were out at the time. It really came down to a few people with a vision of an online world that they could adventure in with their friends. What it turned into was a run away success that is now known as a classic in the online gaming community. <br><br>How EQ has changed in all these years, I remember joking about having to kill rats to level and how a snake could kill you in the starting levels. Now I see players coordinating huge raids against some of the most difficult NPC’s ever! The one thing that remains is that EQ is a challenging RPG. EQ players know what it means to have high level characters, the hours of adventuring, collecting and fighting are represented in players that truly stand behind their characters and have an emotional connection that non EQ players have a hard time relating too. <br><br>We have just rolled out the anniversary content and we will continue to work on addressing Live issues and outstanding bugs. EQ is a huge game and I know that many of you have issues that you would like addressed immediately but I can assure you that we are hard at work fixing bugs, and working to create a better EQ for everyone. One of the areas that I am actually very proud of is our web presence. Our new Community Manager has stepped up the communication between the players and the team and she has quite a few cool ideas that will roll out on the webpage shortly. Since many of you use the page to keep track of the latest news, post and lurk on the message boards and check out all of the other features that EQ players has… I figured that we should focus more of our attention on the actual updates to the page. Ultimately I would like to see the actual players get highlighted on our page. At the end of the day it is the players that should get the recognition, after all we create the world for you all to play in, your accomplishments should be worthy and made public. <br><br>As we celebrate the 8th anniversary of EQ I would like to thank all of you for helping make EQ what it is today. EQ started as an idea to make a game for people that we thought would be fun to play. EQ has become your game and through player feedback, it will continue to be a game made for the players. <br><br>Clint Worley <br>EverQuest Producer<br><br><a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50380">Messages from some of the original EQ team members.</a></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 18 Mar, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27526">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27526</a><br>Printed On: Sat Mar 24 0:13:55 PDT 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
