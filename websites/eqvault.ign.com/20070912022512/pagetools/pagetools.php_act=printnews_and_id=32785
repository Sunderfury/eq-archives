I wanted to make a post that collected some of the information from various threads and make it a sticky.  If you see something here that is incorrect, please let me know, so I can correct any misinformation.  We are working to come up with a patch to address most of these issues, but it make take some time to make that happen.<br><br>Issue:  UI comes up apparently "randomized" when starting the game in windowed mode.<br>Cause:  This is because we now use the desktop resolution as a configuration key for loading window layouts.  This especially an problem for widescreen monitors whose desktop resolutions are not included in the defaults.ini file.  So in most cases what is happening is the layout falls back to the lowest possible mode, which is 640x480 which doesn't scale very well up to modern resolutions.<br>Workaround:  Renaming the UI_name_server.ini file to a backup name and re-laying out your UI in windowed mode should allow you to run the game normally.  Other non-window layout related settings may be copied from the backup file to the new file that EQ will create.<br>Status:  Fixed.  Still needs to go through QA.<br><br>Issue:  Certain custom UI elements are not sizing properly.<br>Cause:  Investigating, but it's related to the sizes specified in the XML files not being used--rather the .ini file sizes are being used.<br>Workaround:  This one is painful, but until we get a real fix you can copy the custom sizes from your XML files into the appropriate section of your UI_name_server.ini file.  Deleting your defaults.ini may work in certain cases, but the file will be replaced when you run the patcher.<br>Status:  No update.<br><br>Issue:  The EQ window in windowed mode now goes behind the taskbar.<br>Cause:  Investigating.<br>Workaround:  You can either set your taskbar to auto-hide, or you can turn off "Keep the taskbar on top of other windows" in the taskbar properties.<br>Status:  No update.<br><br>Bugs with no current work-arounds:<br><br>Issue:  Bazaar trader window disappears when resizing, but the game doesn't think it's disappeared.<br>Status:  No update.<br><br>Issue:  Container windows moving slightly when closed and re-opened (need more details on this one).<br>Status:  No update.<br><br>Issue:  Full-screen and windowed layouts are not separate.  The current plan is to separate them again.<br>Status:  Fixed.  New window layout will use the "XPosWindowed" style in the UI_name_server.ini file.  Still needs to go through QA.<br><br>Issue:  Windows that are partially off-screen are snapped back on screen.<br>Status:  Fixed.  If the the window is partially off the screen when the resize is started, it will remain so after the resize.  Still needs to go through QA.<br><br>Issue:  Viewport resets to default after a resize.<br>Status:  No update.<br><br>Issue:  No way to set windowed mode to a specific resolution.<br>Status:  Fixed.  The video modes window will now manually set the windowed mode size when in windowed mode.  Still needs to go through QA.<br><br>Issue:  Switching fullscreen/windowed or resizing causes the mail window or other window to pop up.<br>Status:  No update.<br><br>Issue:  Alt-Tab or clicking on a second monitor when EQ is running in fullscreen forces EQ to minimize.<br>Status:  No update.<br><br>Let me know if there are more resize/windowing related problems.  If you have reproduction steps, great, if not, just identifying a problem is good too.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 6 Sep, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32785">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32785</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 11 19:25:12 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
