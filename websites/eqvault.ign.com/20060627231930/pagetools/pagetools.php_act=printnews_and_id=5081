Turns out that objects (but not the terrain) on the zone server had their "triangle normals" pointed in the opposite direction for zones created using the new DX9 data format (EQG files). This was causing problems for NPC pathing and any other server code that depending on being able to "find the ground" when standing on top of one of these objects (as opposed to the standard terrain geometry). Many Omens of War zones had a number of places where entire sections of the zone were using this type of geometry, such as the tunnels in the bloodfields, and this would cause all kinds of problems with pathing, summoning pets, and things of that nature. After this problem was finally identified thanks to some debugging features we've recently added, it was easy to fix and seems to have helped a lot. This fix went in with today’s update.</blockquote><br>Interesting article with a ton of answers.
