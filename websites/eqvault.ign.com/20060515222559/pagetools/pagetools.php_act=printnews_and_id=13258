This should be a normal group task where up to 6 players can work together.  The problem is already fixed on test and should be fixed on the live servers asap (likely within the next few days)."<br><br>Kytherea posted later in the thread on EQLive "This should be fixed tonight."<br><br>People also were irritated that anyone can loot the chests that spawn from completing the task.<br><br>Kytherea posted, "There should be multiple chests spawning as a result of completing this event, and yes the chests are available to everyone."<br><br>Oshran commented on EQLive:<br><br>"The party favor chests that spawn on mission complete are for anyone in the area.  Think of it as a piñata.  The New Year gemstones (which are much nicer than anything you'll find in the free party favor chests) go only to the individual(s) who complete the quest. "<br><br>Some people complained that the Bristlebane Party Platter prize was unfair to tradeskillers who worked hard to get the skill to make this item.<br><br>Rashere added:<br><br><blockquote>The  [Bristlebane's Party Platter] BBPP (neat acryonym) is only a 2% spawn chance on the chests.  It's the uber-rare best of the best present the machine gives out.<br> <br>As to the FFA loot...its a holiday event.  Sharing, caring, feel good happiness...the party machine is spreading joy and presents to everyone around when someone finishes the quest.  The person who actually completes the event gets a totally different prize.</blockquote><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 7 December, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13258">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13258</a><br>Printed On: Mon May 15 15:25:59 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
