Welcome, or welcome back!<br><br>The EverQuest community is a great group of gamers.  For those who would like more information about various things, the ongoing and very helpful <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&message.id=220540">returning players FAQ thread</a> on the EQPlayers boards is great.<br><br>For those who might still be considering buying the game, the Titanium package, which includes <b>all</b> the expansions before Echoes of Faydwer is available in the SOE store for just 19.95, and comes with one month free playtime and free items for one character for new accounts.  It's not expensive at all to get started these days.<br><br>For returning players, your characters are all still there on your account, probably no matter how long the account has been inactive.<br><br>As those who play know, EQ has the most complex and fun MMO gameplay out there, and many annoying "features" from the past have been changed to make the user interface much easier and the gameplay smoother.  People ask, "is it worth coming back?" and the answer is always "yes, it is."  There is a reason EQ has such a loyal and long-lived player base:  it's a great MMO that has stood the test of time.  See you in Norrath!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 28 Dec, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24811">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=24811</a><br>Printed On: Sat Jan 6 1:44:10 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
