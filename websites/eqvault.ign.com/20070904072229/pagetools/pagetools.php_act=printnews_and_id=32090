Why did you make a card game instead of working on EQ expansion/ outstanding issues?<br><br>LoN is a joint venture with our SOE Denver studio. They have an amazing team that has years of experience creating trading card games and making a legitimate TCG that encompassed the world of Norrath is an idea that everyone at SOE has been looking forward to. SOE Denver did the majority of the work and both the EQ2 and EQ teams hooked up the LoN client to each respective game. We are looking forward to getting everyone into the TCG and the initial step of that is getting the client out to everyone. I realize that some of you may not be interested in the TCG and that is OK, but we are implementing it as a system in EQ. In the same way that crafting or fishing is implemented, the TCG may not be played by everyone but the option to play is available to everyone. We are not positioning LoN as an optional "add-on" to EQ/ EQ2 thus the download for everyone.<br><br>Can you get TCG loot from NPC's?<br><br>During the Beta period players will not be getting any TCG related loot from NPC's in the game. We are simply using this time to test the TCG client and make sure that the larger rollout is ready for everyone. Right now players that are flagged for the TCG Beta will receive a starter deck and boosters each week. They will be able to keep the TCG cards and loot as well.<br><br>How do I get into the LoN Beta? I didn't go to FF and this isn't fair.<br><br>I have seen a few posts about our decision to offer the LoN Beta to FF attendees. One of the new focuses with this years FF was to open the doors to the future plans for SOE. We showed behind the scene development on multiple titles and it was a great opportunity to announce LoN and actually have people sit and play against each other. FF is an opportunity for the developers to sit and talk with the fans about the good and the bad, the past and the future. It is a commitment to make the FF trip for many of our players, we had people from Las Vegas to Europe come to the event. We do our best to make the timing and location convenient but I completely understand that everyone can't make it. The LoN client has been rolled out and for those of you that are not in the Beta you will be able to play in the next few weeks. I would suggest checking the LoN message boards and getting ready to start trading gameplay and loot cards. If you haven't seen some of the players discoveries go check it out!<br><br>UI, UI oh what to do with custom UI...<br><br>I wanted to address custom UI problems in EQ. Yesterday there were quite a few posts about crashes and problems with players UI working in the game. First off, if you are using the default UI and are having problems please contact CS. We did have a browser bug that was found yesterday but normal UI should not have been affected. <br><br>Let me clarify our stance on custom UI in EQ. We appreciate the motivation and creativity that players have when they create custom UI to be used in EQ. There are many situations when the custom UI is a great addition to the default information. When we roll out updates there is a chance that the custom player created UI will not be compatible. We generally roll out our changes to Test prior to Live but yesterday was an example where that wasn't the case. <br><br>I can assure you that we do not set out to break custom player created UI and it is the side affect of changes that we are making to the game. Since we do not officially support it (meaning that we do not test against it and we do not guarantee that it is secure or safe since it is player created) our stance is that we allow players to create and use custom UI in EQ but when we make changes to the game that break that UI it is up to those players to either convert to the supported UI or wait for the next version of the custom UI that is compatible with the latest client. I know that many of you use custom UI but please understand that you are doing so at your own risk and there might be a delay or permanent incompatibility issues with non-default setups. <br><br>Fan Faire rewards<br><br>We should be rolling these out this week. I am looking forward to seeing what everyone thinks about it and how they use the dice in game. Make sure you post your impressions... (did I really need to write that, I mean seriously... you guys probably have posts ready to go and are just waiting for the item to hit  )<br><br>Patch downtime<br><br>We do our best to get the patches up within the estimated time that we announce. There are occasionally things that are missed on the game side (or are found via testing) and there are also hardware issues that have popped up on occasion. We do our best to get these issues resolved as quickly as possible and bring the servers back up for everyone to play. I am working on this process and I hope to have quicker updates rolling out in the near future. <br><br>I would love to tell you that doing an update is a simple event but it requires coordination between multiple departments and there are many moving pieces. We know that ultimately "you" the customers are making all of this possible and having the servers down is not allowing the players to enjoy the game that they are paying a subscription to enjoy. I offer you a couple of ways to look at the situation though, if we find something in our tests prior to opening up the servers that will impact a large number of players we would much rather wait on a fix then push the servers for the sake of pushing them. It doesn't do anyone any good to have that situation play out. <br><br>The second viewpoint on this is that part of online gaming is the ability to update and maintain a game. That involves patches, hotfixes and I know you don't want to hear it...nerfing *ahem* game balancing. Each of these events affects players in different ways, but it is a requirement for the type of support that these games require. We do our best to minimize these downtimes but it is a reality in the online gaming space. <br><br>The last thing worth mentioning is that we always try to handle these updates mid-week so that if there are any major issues we can have them addressed prior to the weekend. The majority of our players log in and put in some serious hours over the weekend so mid-week updates is optimal for that. I know that there are a variety of you that have dramatically different work hours, school hours, time zone issues and bandwidth differences. We do everything we can to provide new content, bug fixes and a host of other updates as quickly as possible at a time that is optimal for most.<br><br>I just wanted to offer some insight to a few of the topics I have seen on the boards lately. I respond to individual threads here and there but these larger posts seem to be much more visible to the majority of people on the board."</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 16 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32090">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32090</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 4 0:22:29 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
