That time is nearly upon us.  With Game Update 47, voice chat will be available throughout EverQuest II! <br><br>However, we really want this to be a high-quality system that you love to use!  That's why, just days after Game Update 46 has gone live, we're bringing in-game voice chat to the Test server!  We want your feedback! <br><br>Here's a little <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=0&topic_id=421330&#4697832">preview</a> of how EverQuest II's voice chat feature will work.<br><br>The game automatically creates voice channels for Guilds, Guild Officers, Groups and Raids.  You can also create your own custom password-protected user channels similar to how the in-game text chat currently works.  These channels are available through a drop-down box in the new Voice Chat window.  The Voice Chat window also shows the participants currently in the channel and an icon color indicates who is speaking."<br><br>The link above takes you to pictures and a lot more information on how the voice chat will work, in detail.  Their set-up includes troubleshooting for your microphone!  The system does have cross-server capability.<br><br>It looks sweet, and SOE is encouraging everyone to try it out on the test server.  This would replace Ventrilo and Team Speak as the voice chat of choice if it works as described.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 21 Jun, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42519">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42519</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 10 16:44:03 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
