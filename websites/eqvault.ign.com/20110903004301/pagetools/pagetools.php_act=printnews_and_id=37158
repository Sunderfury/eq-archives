Anyone who turned in at least 50 beta tokens (or a single raid token) can speak to Old Man Thorren in Plane of Knowledge on the beta server and request your reward.  This will then allow you to use the /claim system to claim the reward item, the Golden Mask of the Goblin King, on the character and server of your choice.<br><br><br>*** Items ***<br><br>- Made some slight changes to the rare group items in SoF.<br>- Changed the recast group on items with Geomantra to avoid interference with items that have no recast timer.<br>- Added a required level to the Bulwark of Many Portals.<br>- Added Augment Sockets to Elegant Crystalskin Sleeves.<br>- Changed the name of the Moray Eel from the Buried Sea to Barren Moray Eel.<br>- Cultural augments (seals and symbols) will now only fit in armor.<br>- Elegant Charms have had an additional upgrade in their stats.<br>- Many potions that had a different required level than the required level for the spell have been changed to have the item required level match the spell required level.
