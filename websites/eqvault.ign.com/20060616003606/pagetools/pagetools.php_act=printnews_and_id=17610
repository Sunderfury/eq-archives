We aren't going to push this thing out before its complete and hope that we can "finish up" the rest of the work while its live.  That's sort of like trying to lay track in front of a moving train...not a situation I'm interested in pursuing.<br><br>The press release said June and that still holds true.  The beta for this will be starting soon and based on that (and some other ancillary tasks), we'll have a better idea of when in June." <br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 19 May, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17610">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17610</a><br>Printed On: Thu Jun 15 17:36:06 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
