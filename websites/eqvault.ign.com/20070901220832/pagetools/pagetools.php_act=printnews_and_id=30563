Why stop at video gaming?' Brody asked. Why not Blackberries, cell phones, or other irritating habits, he said."<br><br>Classifying something as a psychiatric disorder gives it legitmacy as a specific disease, which can become a political issue.  Video gaming could be regulated more strongly if the AMA pronouces it as causing an addictive activity.  On the other hand, if there is indeed addiction specifically linked to MMO playing, then insurance companies and others will have to recognize the problem and pay for treatment.<br><br>The debate will continue as more and more people begin playing MMOs.  My prediction is that despite protests from the entertainment industry lobby (who don't want to have their leisure activity associated with anything harmful) and others, video game "addiction" will end up being considered an actual disorder.  If that happens, expect more government regulation and pressure on the game industry from parent groups and others to curtail playing times and styles.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 25 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30563">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30563</a><br>Printed On: Sat Sep 1 15:08:32 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
