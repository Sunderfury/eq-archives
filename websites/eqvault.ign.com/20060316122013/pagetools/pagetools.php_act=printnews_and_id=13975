We try to space out AAs a bit and just did a large batch with DoD.  The vast majority of people aren't anywhere near maxed and that ever-moving top end gets really intimidating.  Doing it ever other expansion lets people catch up a bit and keeps that gap from growing too wide.  You may see a few new AAs to support and expand on the new features, though.<br> <br>The zone count in the press release doesn't include the revamped Freeport and Ro zones.  Those aren't part of the expansion and will be available to everyone.<br> <br>...and as Nodyin said, the new Ro looks fantastic.  You'll see shots of it soon, I'm sure.  Best part about it, in my opinion, is that it's instantly recognizeable as Ro."<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 7 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13975">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13975</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:20:13 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
