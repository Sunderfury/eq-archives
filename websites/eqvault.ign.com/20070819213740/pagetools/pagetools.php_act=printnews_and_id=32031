What you're seeing are models that you downloaded when you logged into test from your live EQ directory at some point in the past.  That downloaded the new human file into your folder.  We haven't updated the global memory in a while, so the new human wasn't in there until today which is why its just now showing up.<br><br>If you have a clean install (ie. you haven't patched test on top of live), you won't have this problem.  For anyone else, we're putting up a new version of the global file that will make that model not load on live servers so you won't see it.  It should be up on the patcher in a few minutes.<br><br>Alternately, if you don't want to wait for the patcher, just delete the following files from your EQ directory and then relaunch the game:<br><br>hnm.eqg<br><br>hnf.eqg<br><br>Rashere<br><br><br>Message edited by Rashere on 08/14/2007 16:56:02."<br><br>Update:  Ozyen-Stromm also posted that you may want to try "Deleting hum.eqg and hum_anims.eqg."<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 14 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32031">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32031</a><br>Printed On: Sun Aug 19 14:37:40 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
