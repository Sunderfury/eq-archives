This does include Sebilis and Lower Guk.  We are currently getting those changes out to the live servers and those fabled should begin spawning again soon."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 16 March, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15838">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15838</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 18 18:49:57 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
