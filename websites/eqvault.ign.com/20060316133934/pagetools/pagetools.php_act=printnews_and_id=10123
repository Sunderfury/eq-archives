Those corrupted by the curse began to turn to Necromancy and other similar dark arts. <br><br>The manifestation of this curse is portrayed in the ability for players to create Froglok Necromancers, Shadowknights, Rogues, and Clerics, all of which who follow Innoruuk due to the curse. </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 14 August, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10123">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10123</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:39:34 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
