Here's a very helpful <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&message.id=23000&view=by_date_ascending&page=2">thread</a> on the Progression Server forums.<br><br>The community opinion was that there were over 8,000 name reservations on the Combine server, thus the launch of the second progression server, The Sleeper.  Opening day is definitely going to be crazy!<br><br>A player on the beta, Saltiness, had <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&message.id=23147"> this </a> to say about it:<br><br>"It's pretty much exactly what you would expect it to be. It starts with the original EQ zones with most of the upgrades (seperate from expansions) EQ has seen in the past 7 years.<br><br>There were easily a hundred people in Gfay at the beginning, probably a hundred or more in every newbie zone. It was just like EQ in 1999 but with all the fixes (for better or worse) that have been introduced to the core game since then. The tutorial is gone, newbie armor is gone.<br><br>Casters rule melees like they used to. Low level characters were actually grouping. It was a lot of fun. The population plummeted a week and a half or so after beta opened, most likely due to the fact that 90% of people don't care to level a character that will be deleted in a month. Judging by the initial population though, these servers will be packed for at leat the first two or three expansions. In short: It's good. It's worth playing. If you want those old memories of EQ back you will have fun on these servers."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 26 June, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18748">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=18748</a><br>Printed On: Thu Sep 28 10:35:56 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
