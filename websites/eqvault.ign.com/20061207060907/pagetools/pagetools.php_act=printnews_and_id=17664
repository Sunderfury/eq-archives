Though some guilds have expressed an interest in keeping it as-is, I think the event could benefit from another round of tweaks. <br> <br>First, and most importantly, the knockback AE needs to change.  Getting knocked up in the rafters and becoming irreversibly stuck in geometry isn't good and neither are 4 overlapping damage AEs firing simultaneously.  I've created a new spell for the event that has a much smaller range and much lower upforce component.  With careful placement you should be able to avoid having it overlap and hit the same people multiple times.<br> <br>Second, the vampire adds spawn with twice the frequency during the last half of the event and this is unnecessarily harsh.  Considering the chaos that occurs during this part of the fight, and the fact that crowd control is already locking down adds from the first half, I've reduced the frequency at which they spawn instead of increasing it.<br> <br>Third, there will now be a bit of a warning before the Enforcers attack, and their activations are staggered and sequential.  You shouldn't need a stopwatch to know that four raid-level NPCs are about to select random members of your guild for termination.<br> <br>Due to the spell change, this isn't something that can be Live copied, unfortunately.  It will have to wait for the next major patch.  And if the gung-ho guilds are determined to demonstrate that the event is beatable in its current state, they have that opportunity.  <br> <br>Thanks-<br>-Prathun"<br><br>Even if your guild isn't working on defeating this end-game zone, it's nice to know the devs are listening to the player base and making changes accordingly.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 21 May, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17664">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17664</a><br>Printed On: Wed Dec 6 22:09:07 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
