Pre-December 8, the mission could be completed by one or two people training the Guk intruders to the zone.   In fact, it was probably the most popular AA generating "/afk" monster mission out there, since it could be soloed with all other group members AFK.  After the patch, the mission was supposedly the same, but with the addition of every group member being required to loot a shard from the chest that dropped the mission loot.  After the December 9 patch, more changes were introduced, making the mission a completely different encounter.  Currently the mission is geared toward an entire group fighting the Guk intruders, according to Developer Celrak, who posted this update December 9 on EQLive:<br><br>"I'm sure many of you realize that this mission was not intended to be done solo. In lieu of this, a few changes were made to ensure that you need the better part of a group to take on the different enemies you fight during the mission. The mission still functions in a similar fashion, but you may find that you need to beat these NPCs up a bit more than in the past to get them to flee your home of Lower Guk. Additional changes have been made in regards to your Froglok regeneration (hp/mana/endurance), starting hitpoints, mana, and various spells which should be seen in the next update."<br><br>Unfortunately, people playing the mission posting to the <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=148684&view=by_date_ascending&page=2">EQLive forum thread</a> on this topic are stating that it is almost impossible to complete as it works currently.  So if you choose to start this mission, please be aware that it is much more difficult to complete.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 10 December, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13335">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=13335</a><br>Printed On: Thu Sep 7 22:20:12 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
