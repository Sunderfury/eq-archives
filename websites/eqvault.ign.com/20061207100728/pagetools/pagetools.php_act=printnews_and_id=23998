They feel he should be a much more impressive mount, not a "draft pony."<br><br>Developer Prathun, who designed the encounter where the legendary steed's bridle drops, had this to say:<br><br>"...it sounds like the perception is that the item is named first and then we apply stats based on the name.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  Zajeer created the bridle (and all the other drops in Deathknell) and submitted them to me for naming.  I named it Ghostrider... not because the horse was white, or a pegasus, or really cool, or a motorcycle ridden by a guy in a leather jacket that has a flaming skull for a head, but because it's a musical reference to "Ghost Riders in the Sky".  If you look at the list of drops in the zone you'll notice that nearly all of them are musical references of one sort or another, which should make sense considering that Deathknell is the God of Music's last holdout against the corruption of Mayong.<br><br>Now that I've got the origin cleared up, onto the meat of the issue.  Is the Ghostrider model unique?  Yes.  The horse is unique in that it's the only fast tan-hued horse in EverQuest.  Would it be cooler if we created a unique model with horns and flames and an oversized spoiler specifically for Ghostrider?  Sure.  Is that going to happen?  Not likely."<br><br>So, if you see somene with a tan horse that can go really fast, that's Ghostrider.  He's just like the famous racehorse Seabiscuit -- not so much to look at, but wicked fast!<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 4 Dec, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23998">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23998</a><br>Printed On: Thu Dec 7 2:07:27 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
