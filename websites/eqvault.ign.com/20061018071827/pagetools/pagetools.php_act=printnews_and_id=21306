The Drakkin are humans that have been touched by the blood of a dragon in a ritual that infuses them with the dragon's inherent magic. The dragon-touched experience changes as the latent magic within the dragon's blood surfaces. Their hair takes on new texture and color - the same color as that of their parent dragon. Parts of their skin show small, toughened scales. Delicate horns appear in patterns on their forehead and runic patterns begin to show on their face, torsos and legs - all in the color of their dragon progenitor. As their new traits develop, a yearning to find their dragon parents grows deep within them. Many make a pilgrimage into the Serpentspine Mountains seeking out the refuge of Crescent Reach. <br><br>All players who purchase The Serpent's Spine expansion pack, no matter what race or character class they play, will be able to explore the new starting city of Crescent Reach: which is home to merchants, quests and combat. Players can utilize the area as a home base for adventure that spans all 75 levels and makes full use of the new dynamic gameplay features, including: auras, traps, and destructible terrain. <br><br>TSS is available through digitial download only, no box will be in the stores.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 20 September, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21306">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21306</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:18:29 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
