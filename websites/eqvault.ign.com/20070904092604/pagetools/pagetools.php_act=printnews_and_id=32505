I am a big fan of Loral's writing and was pleased to meet him and his lovely wife at the GenCon SOE Meet and Greet this year.<br><br>Of interest is Absor's comment on Loral's report, found below it in the comments section:<br><br>"Heh, I'm being bashed for disliking casual player, yet I am the most casual player you've ever met. I just don't have any delusions about what casual means. I don't expect to be fight Kerafyrm with my casual-geared characters, so I don't stress over the fact that I can't.<br><br>It's certainly understandable if some folks won't find a lot of immediate use from the expansion. I understand that. But the reality is that we have to keep the top level folks busy for a year. The casual folks should still have a fair amount of content to devour, especially when the level cap goes up. This one has to last a year before the next one, and with a standard expansion cycle to build it in, we had to do what makes the most sense for the game.<br><br>And to be clear, there is one zone in location that moves, and it moves because it's attached to the bottom of a walking steamwork. The rest are stationary."<br><br>And yes, GenCon is a happy fun time for nerds, both male and female. The crowd's fascination for scantily-clad elf maidens with flying hair, dragons, over the top medieval costumes, swords, and intense game playing can't be overstated!   Along with traditional Ren Faire sword and sorcery, there are Bible-based games, collectable cards for horse-crazy little girls, and vendors selling tshirts with obscure gamer jokes.  It's great fun and worth the trip, as Loral points out in his article.<br><br>You can read my write-up <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/static.php?page=soegencon">here.</a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 29 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32505">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=32505</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 4 2:26:04 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
