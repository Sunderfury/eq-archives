Here are the highlights:<br><br>“In beta 1998, when the gate spell was first put in, it didn't work. It teleported you, but it teleported you to a random zone and spot in that zone regardless of your bind point. The invisibility spell would make you invisible to yourself but everyone else and all creatures would see you.” ~ Community Manager Zatozia <br><br>“Back in my day, we would bank all our gear before jumping on the boat in Qeynos or Freeport because if the boat dropped you in the water when it zoned and you drowned or were eaten by sharks, it was easier to not have to find that corpse and just kill more mobs for xp than it was to find the corpse; one reason to hate boats. The boat in Qeynos once went on a rampage when it was taunted and killed everyone in the zone; another reason to hate boats. Back in my day, they tried out a spell "fly" for a while but it was horribly broken and quickly removed, I believe it turned into levitate later on.” ~ Community Member Tharkis <br><br>“Back in my day, we had to drop a rusty weapon on the ground to see which way North was. The pointy end always points north.” ~ Community Member WarSheol_EM <br><br>“I remember having to do the Sebilis key twice, you had to leave 1 key on a corpse outside at the orb so you could get back in if rez was unavailable (this was before soul bound keys). I also remember Lower Guk being the hotspot and just about every level 50 was there (pre-Kunark). Also, I remember when the Minotaur Hero was the most feared mob in-game. And last but not least, when duel messages were server wide” ~ Community Member --Joseffe-- <br><br>“Back in my day there was no POK or Teleport stones/books and no translocators/magus to transport you across continents. In most cases you had to use the boats and wait for them to come in. Druid and Wizzy ports existed, but you had to find one who was willing to port you... sometimes this was difficult if they were all busy and no one was offering a service via /ooc or /auction. Even then, once you land you sometimes still had to trek a few zones to get to your final destination... max level was 50 at one point and at that level, some treks were particularly hazardous.” ~ Community Member Gavini_BP_Namless <br><br>“The trek through Highhold Pass was super perilous! It took literally hours to travel from Qeynos to Freeport (or vice-versa) and groups would band together (primitive raids) to make these journey's.” ~ Community Member Phinagle <br><br>“I remember running through WK and EK and getting smacked down by Cyclops and Griffins. I remember when Kithicor was NOT dangerous at night, when Rubicite Armor and manastones were the "must have" items, when GFay was the auction zone on SolRo and was called eFay. Oh, and the orc highway, good times.” ~ Community Member Severine <br><br>“Barbarian males didn't have a shield graphic. Not only were casters required to sit and stare at a book for 35 levels, we had to press the "Meditate" button as well.” ~ Community Member Zixx_Nenix <br><br>“I remember the lifts of Kelethin being dangerous to newbies but not nearly as dangerous as people binding others at the top of the lifts. I remember the dark murky forests of Toxxulia and the zone to Erudin Palace being crowded with Erudites meditating by the only light sources...the firepots. I remember patch work armor and banded mail being auctioned in Qeynos hills, 1 pp per AC.” ~ Community Member Enix65 <br><br>“I remember when the 'world' that we saw was a small square in the middle of your computer screen and all the menus, chat screen, etc. were a thick border around that small square. This also meant that what is now a 'white con' mob was a 'black con' mob because the chat screen didn't have white text, you wouldn't have seen it well.” ~ Community Member Coup <br><br>“Seeing a skeleton carrying a cracked staff and thinking 'jackpot'. 'Bankers' in South Karana i.e. people willing to exchange your gold/silver/copper for plat. When hitting combine would destroy everything in the container if it wasn't a valid recipe (bad for people who used sewing kits as bags) ~ Community Member name_00 <br><br>“I remember being super rich because I was the only one in the zone able to kill wisps because I had a magic, hammer of wrath.” ~ Community Member Binder_Twoshots <br><br>“I remember staring at a book while I medded and others in my group would look out for me and let me know in /g chat if something on Orc Hghway was going to eat me so I could stand up quick. I remember being on lists in Highpass too and fighting over goblin camps in there...lol I remember getting off the boat in Kunark, Firiona Vie and being late for work because the boat ride was 45 minutes from BB to FV, (didn’t know it would be so long at the time but learned to plan my boat rides after that) and I heard if you logged out on the boat you would be dead when you logged back in and I didn’t want to lose my stuff...LOL” ~ Community Member Starla </span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 14 Mar, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27408">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=27408</a><br>Printed On: Sat Mar 24 0:13:03 PDT 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
