That hasn't escaped the keen eye of people who want to educate you.<br><br>From a recent presentation by Merrilea J. Mayo, from The National Academies:<br><br>"Our Dubious National Future in Science and Engineering . . .And How Video Games Might Help."<br><br>"By both quantitative and qualitative measures, the U.S. is losing ground rapidly to technologically-competent countries driven by intense, well-planned science, technology, math and engineering (STEM) education strategies.  The U.S. desperately needs a strong, considered approach to the development of scientists and engineers ­ and, more importantly, a technologically literate public.  However, in an education system composed of locally-administered fiefdoms, national solutions are difficult to impose.<br><br><b>A striking observation is that the number of active subscribers to a single online video game is approximately equal to the yearly output of scientists and engineers graduated by all colleges and universities in the U.S., across all disciplines.</b> This national reach, completely outside the maze of our public and higher education systems, could make video games a “bronze bullet” for solving our nation’s educational crisis.  Further research shows that the learning paradigms espoused by cognitive scientists are all well represented in the video game genre, and, moreover, the chemical state of the brain while playing video games virtually guarantees superior encoding of learned information.  <br>Time on task is huge (for college-bound high school students, the same as homework time), and games can easily be structured to adapt to the specific learning path of the individual.  The possibility that games might be a “bronze bullet” for remedying our national education woes has driven a fast-growing movement of “Serious Game” researchers who are intent on taking this technology to the next level."<br><br>Okay you uber future scientists, here comes the "bronze bullet" -- taking all the fun out of video games and making them "educational."  Let's hope they leave some of the fun in it...  When serious people notice how a fun activity is actually an effective learning tool and is taking wayyy too much of our precious time that could be spent getting a degree in engineering, you can surely expect a visit from a scientist near you.<br><br>Good going to our game designers for making something so fun, and so engaging, that the number of MMO players exceeds people getting degrees in science.  Hmm, play EverQuest or take a chemistry exam ... wonder why you spend as much time playing EQ as doing your homework!<br><br>The "researchers" might also remember that the cost of getting a degree in chemistry is a lot more than $14.95 a month and you can't do it at home with your friends.<br><br>They also might want to examine their assumptions that everyone who plays video games would enjoy doing a quest to discover the periodic table and having to solve differential equations before they could whack the boss mob.  That's like making cold medicine taste like bubble gum.  Games are fun because they are leisure activities.<br><br>Would you still be playing EverQuest if you were made to do it?</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 9 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14025">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14025</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 4:20:06 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
