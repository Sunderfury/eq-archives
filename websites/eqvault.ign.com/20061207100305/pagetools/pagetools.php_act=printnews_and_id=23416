The boat in Freeport, however... Ran into a couple snags, primarily with the Ocean of Tears zone and how it's laid out. That will be fixed in the relatively near future, making the Freeport boat as functional as the Qeynos boat.<br><br>The speed that the boats were running during beta was a hyper-accellerated speed, such that I could test out the functionality of my new boat system, without having to wait an hour for the boat to show up. The boats will move faster than they used to, but they won't be moving that fast. I expect an 8-10 minute round trip for the boats.<br><br>Boats should be ready to go live around the same time as the revamped ocean of tears.   The issue that I ran into was with the orientation of the Ocean of Tears, and I am currently working on the revamp of Ocean of Tears, which is necessary to facilitate proper functionality of the boats."</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 16 Nov, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23416">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=23416</a><br>Printed On: Thu Dec 7 2:03:05 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
