Once they’ve got that nailed down, we’ll be able to get a fix in place."<br><br>On raids in the next expansion:<br>"The majority of raid content with the next expansion will be aimed at players who have exhausted the current raid content in the game. There are some raids that will be doable by mid-tier guilds as well, but those guilds have a lot of older content still at their disposal so it’s less of a focus. ... <br><br>We’re taking a “one step back, two steps forward” approach to raids in the next expansion. The raids will essentially start one “step” back from the current high end and then progress forward so there is a bit of a ramp for mid-tier guilds to use to get into the top-tier areas.<br><br>In addition, we’ve got some plans for the single player game that will make transitioning from a primarily single group player to a raider considerably easier. That should go a long way toward helping those mid-tier guilds out."<br><br>There's lots more info in the chat concerning various things in the game, so <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/hoclogs/20070620.php">check it out.</a><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 21 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30466">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30466</a><br>Printed On: Sun Sep 2 15:49:46 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
