Gaming is a great platform to bring people together. <br><br>A site has been brought to my attention, <a href="http://www.ablegamers.com/">AbleGamers.com</a>, for those gamers playing with disabilities.   Looks worth checking out, even if you aren't disabled.  A great community building idea!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 12 July, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19265">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=19265</a><br>Printed On: Thu Aug 10 3:27:09 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
