Here's a clip:<blockquote>EverQuest in 2005 will continue to expand with more of what you have come to expect and appreciate from the game we all enjoy.  While EverQuest will soon be 6 years young, it is aging well and still setting standards in the industry.  A new expansion, EverQuest®: Dragons of Norrath™, has been announced which opens an area that has long been on the maps of Norrath but not yet available.  We are adding new tradeskill recipes, new features that ease communication and gameplay.  You will see the continued addition of new NPCs and Zones modeled to make use of our New Graphics Engine and will bring a new quality standard to EQ art.  In the coming weeks you will see more of the improvements as screenshots and movies are released for the upcoming EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath launch.</blockquote><br>You can read the article in full <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64007">here</a>.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 13 January, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4777">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=4777</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 6:08:54 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
