This email describes some of these additional features. <br><br>Starting immediately, all new Station accounts will require that passwords must be a minimum length of 8 characters, and be alpha-numeric. This means that at least one of the characters in your password must contain a number. Furthermore, you can now use symbols, such as @, # and $ as part of your Station account password thus making your account even more secure. This new password security requirement is only for the creation of new Station accounts; however, it will be required when a current Station member changes his or her current password, secret question or email address. <br><br>We strongly recommend that you change your current password and update your registration! information including choosing a secret question if you have not already done so. Please make sure that you have provided us with your current and valid email address ? we will use the email address on record to notify you of any changes or activity regarding your Station account and in retrieving lost passwords (this email address will not be used for marketing purposes unless you specifically opt-in for newsletters and announcements.)<br><br>Please remember to NEVER give out or share your Station name or password ? including with friends and Guildmates. <br><br>Please take advantage of this heightened security effort and protect your account from unauthorized use. <br><br>Account security reminders: <br><br>Use a unique Station name <br>Use an alpha-numeric password consisting of at least 8 characters <br>Never use the same word for your Station name and password <br>Always create a secret question when prompted (this allows for quicker password recovery and confirmation when needed) <br>Keep your registration information, including current email address, up to date in so that we can contact you regarding your account and for retrieving lost passwords. <br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 5 June, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8206">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8206</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 3:29:53 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
