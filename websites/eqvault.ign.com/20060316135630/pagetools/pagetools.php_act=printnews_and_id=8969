If you have a shared bank already in use on your destination server, you will need to empty either shared bank out as only one will be available after the movelog is complete.<br><br>For each customer with an account who requests such a move, all characters associated with that customer’s account will be transferred to the selected server.  All characters will bring their items with them in the transfer.  These movelogs will continue nightly for the next 30 days.<br><br>If you have changed your mind as to which server you would like to move to, the /movelog UI has a disregard button.  Using the disregard button will cancel any pending movelog requests and allow you to execute a new movelog request.<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 3 July, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8969">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8969</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:56:30 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
