They do, however, still have scorpions.<br>- The Temporal Chrysalis will no longer disappear if it is used before its proper time.<br><br><br>*** Quests and Events ***<br><br><br>- The lockout for Goru Uldrock, the Reincarnate is now spelled correctly.<br>- Killing Emperor Draygun should properly update his task once again.<br><br><br>*** Tasks ****<br><br>- Fixed the spelling of the quest NPC in the task Simple Arrow for Crescent Reach.<br><br><br>*** NPC ***<br><br>- Fixed the reset issues with Bargangle Tinkerson in Meldrath's Mansion.<br> <br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br>Developer Nodyin added:<br><br>"This is an odd patch. We have some stuff that just *has* to go out in the spells file for some events that will happen in the next few weeks but we can't push out all the spell changes we have because of the focus effect changes we're working on over on Test. So we had to do a special merge of just a few changes into the spells file we'll be pushing out tomorrow to just get the stuff we needed without pushing in-flux focus changes. <br><br>There are also a number of pretty minor bug fixes we're doing on the design side. "<br><br>And Developer Ngrath explained why they mention the smallest details:<br><br>"People complained when we did not put stuff we did in the patches... so we put the changes we did in the patches, even the minor stuff.<br><br>The real simple stuff like spelling, item flags and such very simple things, are almost never the reason for a patch, and are just included to do what you guys wanted...  tell even the little things we did."<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 19 Jun, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42461">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42461</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 18:37:08 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
