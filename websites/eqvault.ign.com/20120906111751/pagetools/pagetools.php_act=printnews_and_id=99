It's one of the few areas of gameplay that we haven't talked much about in a while, but we'll be disclosing some interesting tidbits in the near future. <br>-----------------<br>Moorgard <br>EQII Community Guy"</i><hr noshade/></blockquote><br>It seems there's more to come, cool news for those interested.
