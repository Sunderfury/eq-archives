Instead, you now mitigate the effects based on your alcohol tolerance skill. Due to this change, intoxication effects have been reduced or removed from a number of detrimental NPC spells where they would now cause the encounters to be more difficult than intended.<br><br>- Storm Guard and Frost Shield now have 60 minute durations.<br><br>- Increased the range on Kessdona’s Roar.<br><br><br><br>*** Missions ***<br>----------------------------------<br>- Skrepiz Plaguebringer will now only appear when you have completed all previous requirements in the Rise of Marnek mission.<br><br>- If you are on the mission to Unrest, Nisha Lightbrook will now respond to your first hail instead of requiring two hails for a response.<br><br>- You will no longer be able to loot the notes for the Hate's Fury mission out of order.<br><br><br>*** Items ***<br>----------------------------------<br>- Gloves of Wicked Ambition now have +5 to stun resist, +6 to dot shield, and +2 to mana regen.<br><br>- Mirrored Mask now has a type 8 augmentation slot, by request. Now players can bind a focus augment to the item if they wish.<br><br>- Gem of the Spring Wind from the good DoN camp is now named "Shard of the Spring Wind" and is now a type 7 and 8 augmentation.<br><br><br>*** Alternate Abilities ***<br>----------------------------------<br>- Raised the cap on AA's so that those people who were maxed out can receive all of their Vet rewards.<br>- The shape changing effects of the Jester of Bristlebane will now disappear after 10 minutes.<br><br>*** Code ***<br>----------------------------------<br><br>Windows 98/ME:<br><br>- Users with these operating systems should no longer experience the bug where there UI renders but the 3D scene does not when they first enter the game.<br><br>-- The EverQuest Team </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 18 May, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=7741">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=7741</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 3:41:52 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
