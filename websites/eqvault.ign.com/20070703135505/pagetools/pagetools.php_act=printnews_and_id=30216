Entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/business/worldbusiness/11sony.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">"Sony's Other Games Push in a New Direction,"</a> the article explains that SOE is looking in the direction of a "pay-for-play" model, found most commonly today in games distributed in Asia.<br><br>Some interesting quotes:<br><br>"But tucked within the relative obscurity of Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment, the online entertainment unit has grown into a profitable business with revenue in the $150 million range (the company does not break out exact results for the division) by creating and publishing a variety of subscription-based online computer games."<br><br>"The problem is that the company’s first huge hit — EverQuest, released in 1999 — remains its only genuine blockbuster, with around 250,000 users. (The company used to report subscriber figures, but stopped a few years ago.)"<br><br>It's a shame that EQ's success is considered a problem!<br><br>and<br><br>“Right now our revenue is almost all subscriptions,” John Smedley, the unit’s president, said in an interview. “In two years, we would like to see no more than 50 percent of our revenue coming from subscriptions, and five years from now we think less than 10 percent of our revenue will come from subscription sources.”<br><br>At the same time, Mr. Smedley said he wanted to diversify his customer base, which is 85 percent male and 32 years old, on average. Women have become the major driver of the casual games business (games like Bejeweled and Bookworm), and Mr. Smedley wants a piece of that action.<br><br>“We want to get our average age lower, probably into the low 20s, and I’d really like to see the gender breakdown go to 50-50 or even slightly more women than men, to reflect real life,” he said.<br><br>Sony Online’s new direction can perhaps be seen most clearly in a game the company intends to announce today called Free Realms.<br><br>In general, Mr. Smedley wants to replace subscriptions with a combination of microtransactions, advertising and what he calls the “velvet rope” approach [in other words, you have to buy content within the game -- Ed.]. All three concepts may come to bear in Free Realms, which the company hopes to release on PCs this coming winter and on the PlayStation 3 next summer."<br><br>In the crossed signals department:<br><br>[Smedley's] boss, Yair Landau, vice chairman of Sony Pictures and president of Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment, said: “We are clearly moving beyond men in tights with broadswords. Women in cocktail dresses and stilettos and men in tuxedos with silencers is a very natural place for Sony Online to be expanding.”<br><br>Umm, if "Women have become the major driver of the casual games business ... and Mr. Smedley wants a piece of that action," then why don't you give them silencers and a pant suit, since most gamer women know you don't usually chase after the bad guys with a long dress and 6" heels.   Hello, Mr. Landau, gamer women don't want to be just the hero's ornament anymore .... /sigh.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 13 Jun, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30216">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=30216</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jul 3 6:55:05 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
