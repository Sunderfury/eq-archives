And who better to do an inside evaluation than the game producer?<br><br>Lena says:<br>"The number one thing we wanted to with The Serpent's Spine was to show everyone what EverQuest has become today. Our high-level players have been experiencing what I like to call modern EverQuest for quite a while. This is complex scripted events, destructible objects, inter-player tactics and modern day graphics that rival all other MMOs on the market today. So, we decided to create a brand new player race - and starting city - and made this modern EverQuest content for every level in the game. Not only did we provide new cutting-edge high-end content, but we now have a great content path for any new or returning players. <br><br>Also, when we set out to do the content, we focused a lot of strong story-driven quest arcs. This is not kill, loot and repeat. We have brought a lot of our raid encounter knowledge down to group, mid-level "mini raids". We have also limited the amount instancing of content to just those encounters that are necessary for some sort of progression to encourage the old school social-based adventuring. <br><br>The bottom line is that we wanted to make an expansion that would have our current players saying to their friends "If you have ever thought about trying EQ, you should pick up The Serpent's Spine." Only the players can tell us if we succeeded in that or not."<br><br>There's lots more so be sure to follow the link above.
