It's something I'd like to do in the future, but we want to get a good global solution to the problem inherent to charm in place first. <br><br>Manaburn:<br>Rashere - We've currently working on unravelling the manaburn code. I don't know if it will be done before the expansion, but if not, it should show up soon after. <br><br>Grobb Event:<br>Prathun - The retake of Grobb event was an independent event, and not directly related to the expansion. Keep an eye out in the future for other live events that will lead directly into the opening of Depths of Darkhollow. <br><br>Depths of Darkhollow Details:<br><br>Level:<br>Rashere - The expansion areas are geared for players of level 45 and up, but monster missions can be played by anyone from level 1 to level 70. In fact, they can even play together in the exact same mission so its a great way for older players to go play with newer ones. <br><br>In addition to being able to play with lower level friends, you'll be accumulating experience on your main character as well. The experience will seem lower the farther you get from your main's level, as lower level monsters are worth less experience, but you'll still be making progress. <br><br>Rytan - The progression for spirit shrouds is completely separate from the experience you gain to increase your character's level. So you won't have to allocate any of your normal experience to advance your shrouds. It's completely a bonus on your normal experience. <br><br>Content:<br>Rashere - There's a good mix of single group and raid content. Specifically for single groups and more casual players, you can take a single group into any of the zones, the missions, and both the monster mission and spirit shroud content is idea for more casual players. <br><br>Rashere - Yes, there are a variety of quests that you can get as a solo player. You'll likely find life easier if you take a group along, but some of them can be done solo as well. <br><br><br>Spells:<br>The new spells for DoD will be 65+. The expansion will also have areas where you can obtain the spells originally include with omens of war. <br><br>Rytan - I don't want to give too much away, but there will at very least be an Illusion: Orc spell available to enchanters. <br><br>Maddoc - We will also be introducing a completely new system for researching spells that I think you guys will enjoy.<br><br>Maddoc - There will be a host of new Research based recipes in Depths of Darkhollow which will allow players to research spells from Planes of Power and a spell or two from other, newer expansions. <br><br>Tradeskills:<br><br>Maddoc - Specifically regarding fletching, that's an issue that is something that we will be looking at addressing as a live update, rather than tying it to an expansion, which will likely happen after we launch DoD.<br><br>Type 12 Augmentations:<br>Currently, type 12 augmentations are general purpose augmentations that can be obtained in Omens of War and Dragons of Norrath. There have been some ideas behind creating some more augments of this type for Depths of Darkhollow. <br><br>Maddoc - Without going into any specifics, you will certainly see some type 12 augments that are crafted in DoD. Depths of Darkhollow will continue the trend with the Cultural based armor, allowing players to further customize their set of armor with more type 12 augmentations. <br><br>AA's:<br>Rashere - Some of the AAs will introduce unique abilities while others will upgrade or extend the functional of previous ones. There's a good mix of both. <br><br>Spirit Shrouds/Playing as a Monster:<br>AbsorEQ - A large number of the monster missions will be part of the story of Darkhollow. They allow players to experience the history of the place rather than just read about it. But we've also added a few monster missions in the old world that will be a lot of fun to play (yes, you have to own the expansion to play in them). <br><br>Rashere: we have created a large variety of monster missions that will take you back to some of the more famous EQ zones and put you in the shoes of the creatures that inhabit them. You'll be able to play the game from the standpoint of some of your favorite creatures from the past. <br><br>Monster missions are an extensive of the mission system and like regular missions, they are built to be played through with a group.  About 1/3 of the missions in the expansion are monster missions. They take place in a variety of zones including the expansion areas as well as various old world zones.<br><br>Monster Missions use their own unique creatures for the missions. As I mentioned before, some of them are some of your favorite creatures from the past including the much rumored Lord Nagafen. <br><br>The spirit shrouds are usable in any zone, but can only be accessed through specific NPCs. These NPCs are in various locations around Norrath including the plane of knowledge so that players can access them easily. You'll also have to return to a spiritmaster in order to transform back into your normal character. <br><br>As far as abilities, stats, and equipment the monster is an entirely separate character that you can control. You can play a variety of classes and creatures regardless of your main character's class. <br><br>Rytan - It's important to realize that the "class" descriptions given in for the monsters are approximations to existing classes and they don't necessarily represent the same ability set that the player class has. The monsters generally have a much more limited skill set available to them then a player character would. <br><br>Rytan - No, your main character's AAs and statistics will not figure into the power of the spirit shrouds. You will however be given a number of points to spend on monster AAs each time you transform into a monster. You'll also be able to save favorite abilities sets and have it automatically purchase the same AAs as the last time you used the monster. <br><br>Rytan - Morphing into a spirit shroud will not change your pvp status. In that regard it will be just like you were your main character. <br><br>Rytan - We haven't ruled out the possability of special quested spirit shrouds, but we don't have any specific plans for them at this time. <br><br>Rytan - The longer you play the spirit shrouds the more of the various shrouds you'll unlock, and some of the later ones will be more powerful then the first set that is available.  Each set of shrouds has a specific power level, but the more you play them you'll be able to unlock different monsters that are more powerful then the base ones.  So you might start off playing a wolf and then have access to a tiger that would be stronger then the wolf. <br><br>Evolving Items:<br>Evolving items will be available at all level ranges covered by the expansion, though the talking intelligent items will be relatively rare.  Rashere - Evolving items will gain experience when you are wearing them while killing creatures. They can gain experience off any kill in most cases. <br><br>End Game Content:<br>Prathun -There will be an instanced raid zone at the end of Darkhollow. It will be similar in form and function to Anguish / Tacvi, and has enough raid content to keep the end-game players busy for quite awhile.<br><br><br>Read the entire chat <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Crier&message.id=180">here</a><br> <br><br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 29 August, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10531">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10531</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:47:11 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
