The 350 people in High Hold Keep running back-to-back monster missions have gone elsewhere, hopefully to actually play the character they rolled.<br><br>I admit that I partook of the experience bonus and managed to get a lot more AAs than I had before. But apart my personal benefit (which of course matters most to me), how did this amazing 72 hours affect EverQuest?<br><br><b>“Black Wednesday”</b><br><br>Loral at mobhunter.com wrote a very balanced report on the rollback circumstances, quickly named “Black Wednesday,” which ultimately lead up to the double experience weekend.  This boon of light speed experience was a goodwill gesture by the SOE staff to try to sooth the angry beast of a player base, as well as an extraordinary opportunity to make up some of the losses of experience and AAs due to the rollbacks.  I imagine the Live Team really had no idea that rollbacks would generate this kind of anger, which grew like a tsunami, washing over everyone and carrying the entire player community along in its path.<br><br>I won’t go into detail here about how a programming error was exploited by players who knew a good sale when they saw one, and then, like a rash of counterfeit money thrown from a low flying plane into a crowded street, managed to taint a lot of innocent people in subsequent transactions.  We are going to move on.<br><br>After the initial damage was done, there came the decision to rollback somewhere around, according to Producer Chris Lena, “less than 1%” of the player population to save the game economy. This estimate was probably very accurate, but since it didn’t jibe with the anecdotal evidence from the playerbase, who claimed much higher numbers were rolled back --some players even twice -- and no one exactly understood what one percent really meant in terms of actual numbers of players, in the end this soothing statistical balm did nothing but irritate more.<br><br>In all fairness, we were warned with messages broadcast in-game about not buying and selling until the problem was solved, although I think many people thought the messages didn’t apply to them since they hadn’t directly purchased items from the beta merchants.  (That's assuming they got read at all).  The problem was the secondary and tertiary contamination of the economy which continued on long after the original incident was long over.<br><br>The chat rooms and message boards became the focal point for the incident and its aftermath.  Explanations and accusations concerning the initial event and then the subsequent rollback policies flew around message boards, in chat rooms and on server chat channels.  It wasn’t clear who exactly was responsible for the unfairness of the rollbacks, but everyone was accused: the exploiters in the first place, the programmer who didn’t check to make sure the merchants in the beta weren’t pushed live, customer service, Producer Chris Lena, and even Community Relations Manager Kytherea for her efforts to soothe the community as well as consolidating the rollback threads as they rolled out like spilled marbles from a bag. This consolidation effort, according to some posters, clearly indicated she was not feeling the pain of the playerbase and wasn’t taking a ball bat to whoever might be in charge on their behalf. Her protests of efficiency went largely ignored or else were turned into reasons for more anger.  The innocent as well as the guilty had been caught up in the net of wholesale correction and people wanted answers.<br><br>No matter who was to blame (if anyone) for people’s unhappiness at losing epic items, rare drops, dkp items, AAs, platinum, experience, and even entire corpses with gear that couldn’t be recovered, the innocent (and not so innocent) victims of the rollback let their feelings be known. Incensed message board posters and chat room participants asked for firings, calls to the Better Business Bureau, exposes by CNN, and even t-shirts saying “I was rolled back” to punish, in no particular order, the customer service reps, the programmers, the developers, the code monkeys, the perceived SOE apologists and moles, the community representatives, the people who bought the items in the first place knowing it was too good to be true, the conspiracy theorists, the people with less than 100 posts, the people with more than 100 posts, the community relations manager, and the producer.<br><br>The heated discussions on the message boards, complete with conspiracy theories and accusations of the wildest kinds, started resembling a mob mentality; people were fueling the fire and supporting the anger.  In an attempt to get satisfaction and create general mayhem, the address and phone number of producer Chris Lena was posted on the EQPlayers board.  Unfortunately, it was the wrong Chris Lena in San Diego, who probably was not able to do much about a problem in a game he had nothing to do with.<br><br>In an attempt to make the incident seem even more important in a global sense, a thread appeared on how the drop in Sony stock that day was sure to be related to the rash of account cancellations by people who just said enough is enough and SOE be dammed.<br><br>More and more people joined in the conversation.  The frustration and anger from the player base focused primarily on the staff at SOE, not the original players who tainted the economy. Anyone who asked for restraint or sympathy for SOE was quickly branded a collaborator.  Frankly, I think SOE used quite a bit of restraint in not suppressing more of the spiraling anger that was escalated as posters complained and gained sympathy from fellow players.  As a vehicle for news, the message boards were excellent when it came to disseminating the player base's perceptions about what had happened; at the same time they exacerbated an already tense situation.<br><br>Unable to get satisfaction in game, some players expressed their anger by using their perceived economic power.  A rash of posts about account cancellations and even a call for a boycott of the new expansion appeared on the EQPlayers boards, much of which was suppressed because it was against the board rules to call for boycotts and player strikes. These were strong messages of dissatisfaction, but if the in game items were so important to these players, how would not even playing the game at all give a lasting satisfaction?<br><br>Something had to be done. In a rather elegant move, the live team reset all the servers to give double experience for everyone for the entire weekend. And even when the servers had to go down again on the first day, because it turned out that AA experience wasn’t doubled, the SOE team didn’t falter, but instead extended it to Tuesday morning.<br><br>Understand, too, that SOE is bringing out two expansions in the next three weeks, one for EQ and one for EQII.  It wasn’t like they didn’t have anything else to do.<br><br>Was the exploitation game-changing to the point that it needed to be fixed? I am not a developer, so I assume it was.<br><br>Was the double experience weekend game-changing to the point where the beta merchants pale in comparison? Yes.<br><br><b>Game Changing Dynamics</b><br><br>Now that it’s over, did anything really change?  Yes, I think so.  Here are just a few of what I believe are game changing circumstances, both long lasting and short term:<br><br>--The economy in game: spells and gear for all the new-born upper and mid-level  characters are at a premium. Prices are high. Supply and demand kicked in when suddenly everyone wanted to buy spells and runes. And gear is probably lacking as well. In fact, one could say this was a bonus, getting plat out of the game and circulating in the economy as the demand for new gear explodes.<br><br>--The economy out of the game: how many copies of Depths of Darkhollow were sold this weekend, since you couldn’t get the monster mission experience without it?  What about people buying platinum to support their new twinks?<br><br>-- The idea that EverQuest was a game that might change in the course of an afternoon. Before the rollbacks, nothing like the kind of character losses people experienced had occurred in many years in the game.  EverQuest works, which is why when something like this happens it is an unpleasant surprise to the majority of the playerbase.  It was a shock to many people that a character could be rolled back because the live team decided it was in the best interest of the game.  The developers have always had the right to do just that, and do it often without disrupting us too much; we have been lulled into complacency about the persistence of our characters and game world.  People were logging in to check if they had been rolled back, since the rumor was that even people not logged in had been affected.  It was a moment of uncertainty for many people.<br><br>-- The state of customer service in the game was brought sharply into focus. The petition volume was tremendous, I am sure.  The customer service scripts, which seemed not to be addressing the specific problems, were upsetting to the playerbase.  Yes, CS was overwhelmed and these particular problems were difficult to fix, if not impossible to do.  I do think SOE could take a look at their customer service responses and make some improvements at least in customer perceptions.  Canned scripts were just frustrating and there seemed to be no way to escalate an issue in a situation that was not the normal state of affairs for the game.  Probably more information would have helped the situation tremendously and some sympathy for the problems people were facing would have gone a long way to lessen the tension.<br><br>--The rash of new high level players. Since so many people took advantage of monster mission experience, which was about 2.3 AA per run or about six missions per level (and about one mission for a character lower than level 50), we can expect a huge influx of high level players to the game.  These new high level characters will have an impact on the EQ experience as a whole. Some people went from level one to 70 without even playing their class once. This will create a whole generation of fizzling raid members who haven’t any idea where anything is, let alone how to use their class effectively.  I believe this will impact guild recruiting policies as the raiding guilds step up vigilance for high level characters that don’t have flags, keys, and basic class knowledge.<br><br>More high level characters aren’t the worst thing in the world; most people can learn to play a class in about a week and it’s not hard to skill up if you work at it.  If people have the desire to play their newly-born high level character, they’ll manage to do it.  They will find a map and soon blend in with the rest of us.  And look at it this way, they did put in the time to work up a character; they didn’t buy one out of a box.<br><br>--The benefits of the monster missions. It was pointed out to me by some knowledgeable people that it was a fast tutorial on learning the basics of group dynamics.  You had to follow directions, work as team, and understand your role.  Unlike previous /afk missions where people did nothing, in the newly designed monster missions no matter what your level of experience or playtime, you learned how to get a mission, be in a group, work together, and reach a team goal in a certain amount of time.  People ran them so many times it became second nature to act as a team no matter who you grouped with.  Even the tutorial doesn’t offer this kind of a crash course on how to play effectively.<br><br> --The upcoming desire for more upper level content from guilds whose players now have appropriate AA’s and levels. The benefits to marginal guilds, who had too many players not able to quite make the grade in high level zones, are substantial and will most likely change play on many servers.<br><br>--The lack of low level players. Even people who before this weekend might have played at the lower levels will now be in the 50s to the 70s due to lightning fast leveling, so the lack of people to play with at level 15-30 after “Double Weekend” may be a detriment to the game. This has been a complaint from new players all along, and it’s not going to get any better when people leveled up twice as fast this weekend, again leaving a gap in the player base for mid-range characters.<br><br>--The desire for the upper level game. This weekend demonstrated that for the majority of players, the lower level game is something to bypass as quickly as possible, despite a lot of noise about a slower leveling server. Let’s face it, this weekend was a reality check for the importance to most people of leveling, fast. <br><br>-- The desire for easy leveling.  Monster mission grinding went on 24/7 into Tuesday morning on my server.  The MM phenomenon demonstrated in a dramatic fashion that players will always take the easy way out and level up just as fast as they can, regardless of whether it’s “fun” or not – running the same monster mission as quickly as you can 300 times just cannot be considered fun no matter what. People were pleading in vain to get groups for anything besides the mission in High Hold Keep, “Pickclaws Revenge,” which was acknowledged as the best and easiest experience if you weren’t big enough or brave enough to hunt in The Nest. Players say they want difficult and complex encounters, but this weekend was a classic example of players flocking to the easiest and most efficient areas for leveling.<br><br>--Ridiculous behavior in game.  Thankfully, the presence of griefers in EQ is usually confined to isolated incidents, but this dimension of the game was exacerbated with the mass influx of almost everyone on my server into High Hold Keep (which most people had never been to before, ever). Groaning under the strain, the instanced servers were stretched to the limit, sometimes locking people out of the longer instanced missions. The overcrowding in HHK lead to some interesting situations because players couldn’t get what they wanted immediately, which was to get a group as fast as possible, hail Creq, and get in the mission without wasting one minute of double experience. I for one will not miss 300 people typing “lfmm nt.”<br><br>At one point on my server during a peak time, 300 people were all trying to say “set” to poor Creq (who should have his nightmare problem well solved by now I would hope). A rumor started that Creq was not responding, purportedly because his buffer had overflowed and would not reset unless everyone stopped saying the word set for 30 seconds. He was actually never broken, but as we all know the truth rarely matters once rumors start to fly. Spammed shouts (in capital letters, natch) of “let Creq reset" and "stop saying set for 30 seconds” filled the zone. This tactic wasn’t as effective as planned since just about everyone ignored the shouters.  Some of the more impatient players who wanted the word “set” to be un-uttered for 30 seconds decided to take matters into their own hands. In an ironic imitation of the original rollback fiasco where innocent players were affected in an attempt to solve a problem, the "don't say 'set' police" trained the rogue guild masters into the crowd in an attempt to kill off players saying “set."<br><br>This absurd killing fest (which of course did nothing to solve any problem) spawned the appearance of a GM in the zone to try to stop the carnage. For you old schoolers, it was reminiscent of the “opening of Fear plane” event, where dark elves invaded Rivervale with disastrous results to unknowing newbies. Finally, from the probably overwhelmed GM, there came a broadcast: if you were training mobs you would be banned. The Rogue GMs still were wandering the zone though, so we just learned to deal with it and rez the unfortunate.  EQ players for all their faults are excellent at dealing with the absurd.<br><br>The training went on throughout the weekend on a sporadic basis, mostly because at that point it was amusing to bored players. A new twist was added when some clever people found the humor in casting MGB wolf form on the crowd, which nicely took care of the non-kos players. A pile of dead dogs is funny when you have done the same thing over and over for 12 hours.<br><br>We won’t even talk about the people who sat on Creq’s head and went afk, making it impossible to get near him. That’s just being a dork.<br><br>--What EQ is really about:  playing with others.  In HHK, and elsewhere, it was so easy to get a group. Everyone cooperated – a nice example of how players can help one another. The uber guilders were mixing with the family guild casual players and the unguilded on an even playing field, which rarely happens in the current EverQuest game.  New friendships were formed.  Old friendships were renewed because this was the first time that people got back together in the same zones. Guilds worked together in the monster missions to help their members develop their characters. People added to their friends lists.  Monster missions brought out a few griefers, but more importantly, the monster missions reminded us of the importance of social relationships in the game.  As people diligently worked on AAs and leveling to enhance their guilds and make their raid forces more effective, they helped friends and strangers achieve their goals as well, which is what EQ is all about. This was clearly a positive gain from monster mission grinding; nice things happen when people have a common goal. <br><br>I hope all of you who took advantage of this windfall had a good time and achieved some things that you would have had to work much harder for on a normal day.  The game has changed, again, but that’s what makes EverQuest the oldest and most persistent MMO out there.<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 25 January, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14423">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=14423</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 13 16:27:19 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
