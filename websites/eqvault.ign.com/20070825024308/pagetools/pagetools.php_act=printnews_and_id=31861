We're giving away free starter packs to all EQ and EQ II subscribers<br><br> 2) If you don't want to spend money on cards - you can get booster packs as drops in-game just by killing stuff. This means that you can also get the same in-game loot items without spending money.. including the rare stuff.<br><br> 3) The game is intended to bring a different kind of gameplay into both EQ and EQ II - we want to offer greater variety of gameplay in addition to the normal expansion packs. Are we going to make money from it? Yes.<br><br>4) You will NOT be able to trade the in-game items. We are spending a lot of time and effort fighting plat-sellers and we didn't want to put in a mechanic that attracts more of them. THIS INCLUDES THE BAZZAR SERVERS ON EQ II (i.e. too bad.. no selling these items period).<br><br>5) This is not some slippery slope towards selling items directly in EQ & EQ II. We had a cool idea for a card game set within the lore common to both games. Yes, we chose to include in-game loot as part of the fun rewards you could get when you open booster packs. However, as I said... you don't have to spend a dime to get exactly the same things. I should also point out that these items are similar to Veteran rewards or pre-order items in that they tend to be more fun.. not some big powerful in-game item."<br><br>You can see the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/soevideos">entire presentation</a> of the new product and more in the Community Address by Smed at Fan Faire on YouTube.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 9 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31861">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31861</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 24 19:43:08 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
