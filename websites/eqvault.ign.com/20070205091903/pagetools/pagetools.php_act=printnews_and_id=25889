The developers have posted a <a href="http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50321">page</a> explaining how they work on the EQPlayers site (with pics!).<br><br>In a nutshell:<br><br>Banners were created to help late arrivals get to a raid.<br><br>The basic banner is free to any guild.  Advanced banners can be purchased in the guild hall and have extra features.  Guilds can customize their banners with emblems and colors.<br><br>Guild members purchase special stones in the guild hall to use the banner after it's been placed.<br><br>Only one banner can exist in the world at a time.<br><br>The banner is planted by the leader or an officer, and stays in place for one hour.<br><br>There's lots more detail on the page linked above!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 27 Jan, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=25889">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=25889</a><br>Printed On: Mon Feb 5 1:19:03 PST 2007<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
