Should we make fantasy worlds the way some folks think the world should be, or is it okay to base some story lines and situations on events and practices that occurred sometime in human history, good or bad?<br><br>Granted, the two situations here don't allow the player much choice to choose good or evil -- if you want to make certain things, you need shark fin, and if you want to raise faction in Kunark so you can run around without a hassle, you need to aid some nasty characters -- but by participating in the game, you aren't necessarily stating you believe such things are right in real life.  Other game scenarios allow you to choose your moral path within the story.<br><br>The world of Norrath is very different from real life.  The stories may borrow events and situations that have parallels in world history, but these events are part of a greater fantasy world that has no basis in reality whatsoever.  If you play a necromancer, are you an evil corpse summoning magic user in real life?  I doubt it!<br><br>Should we take what we participate in seriously? Of course.  Should we cease having fun because a fantasy situation reminds us of something abohorrent in real life?  Maybe.  But please, take it in context.  Imagination is not reality.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 19 Jun, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42463">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=42463</a><br>Printed On: Wed Sep 5 21:22:47 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
