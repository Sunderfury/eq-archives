Here's pint's worth from it:<br><br><b><i>Gamergod</i>: Travel in EQ2...will this game start with a better travel system, something like the current EQ has, with many options to move around the game world? Or can we expect the same vast open spaces to be explored by foot as in the good old days?</b> <br><br><br><b><i>EQ2 Dev Team</i>: We've designed a simple system of travel for our two starting cities so that players can easily find each other and get where they need to go quickly.</b><br><br>Hm, sounds like mass transit in the newer Norrath. Should be cool to see how that plays out.<br><br><a href=http://vnboards.ign.com/EQ2_General_Board/b22210/72943689/?0>[Post A Comment]</a><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 29 July, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=89">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=89</a><br>Printed On: Thu Sep 7 22:07:37 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
