e are a raiding guild, on the Luclin server, that hosts open raids several times a week.  We are currently working on flagging and epics for our extended family. <p>

Most raiding guilds refuse to work with family or social guilds.  If they do raid together, the raiding guilds frequently demand the lion's share of the loot.  Alliance Raiders has a different attitude.  We believe that any person willing to work should have an opportunity to advance their characters, regardless of their affiliations.<p>

As with most raiding guilds, we do have a DKP (Dragon Kill Points) system.  However, our system is open to anyone who raids with us.  Whether you are a guild member or not, the more you raid with us, the more loot you will receive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=1486&TabID=911" target="_blank"><strong>Angels
of the Underworld</strong></a><br>
<em>"If we are mark'd to die, we are enough to do our country loss; and if to
live,
the fewer men, the greater share of honour.</em>
<p><em>God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more. By Jove, I am not covetous
  for gold, nor care I who doth feed upon my cost. It yearns me not if men my
  garments wear... such outward things dwell not in my desires...</em></p>
<p><em>But if it be a sin to covet honour, I am the most offending soul alive. --
King Henry V</em><br>
<br>
  Full Members are NOT required to have any of their alternate characters tagged
  as Angels. However, Full Members should have any alternates, that they regularly
  play, tagged so that they can participate in the guild chat and events. All
  guilded alternates must be listed in the roster. Full Member's main character
  (40+) must
  have the following keys: Sebilis. Full Members must be registered on Guild
  Portal and have their EQ Profile up-to-date.</p>
<p>As of 1/9/03, we have instituted a 1 re-invite maximum for all returning candidates.
  If you leave the guild and later wish to rejoin, you will only have one opportunity
  to do so. No second re-invites will be approved. There are exceptions to this
  rule, of course. Real life issues that prevent you from playing the game will
  always allow for a re-invite. Leaving the guild because you were looking for
  a better guild or because you got mad, are not acceptable reasons for a second
  re-invite and in some cases are not good reasons for any re-invite at all.
  Returning candidates can always request an exception to the rule for Guild
Council consideration.
<p>Joining a guild should be a carefully thought out decision. We do not want
  members who join on a whim. Likewise, leaving a guild should only be done after
  careful consideration and after all attempts to fix the problem have been tried."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cestusdei.org/news.php" target="_blank"><strong>Cestus Dei</strong></a><br>
"A collective group of bastards" is the slogan; no recruiting information
listed;
recruiting closed.
Anguish level guild. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.chaosjustice.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Chaos Justice</strong></a><br>
  "Chaos Justice has been growing rapidly recently and we have nearly reached
  our guild size goal. We are closing applications to some classes and raising
  the requirements to more closely match the level of our leaders. We are serious
  on the listed requirements. If you don't have the required level, and swear
you are levelling fast, fine, please do so, and then post your application. </p>
<p>Hanging out with CJ: It is important to note that we are a raiding guild so
  you must be ready to leave an experience group anytime a raid is announced.
  Hiding with anonymous
  will not be tolerated. The guild is not responsible for helping you get your
  epic or complete any other quests, although we do this at times if there is
no raid planned. </p>
<p>Please note date and mob of raids you attend, for the rare case you are forgotten
  on the raid logs. If you have friends or rl friends in guild tell us. </p>
<p>Timezone: CJ is a European guild so you need to know most of the guild activity
  will be between 7pm CET (1pm EST) to around midnight CET (6pm EST). Be sure
  your
online times match these times. </p>
<p>Attitude: We ask full loyality from our members as well as from future members.
  So please leave your old guild before you apply to CJ. Also applying to multiple
  guilds
  simultaneously does not seem appropriate. You either want to join us with your
full heart, or you can stay away. </p>
<p>One last general requirement is the ability to listen to criticism and learn
  from it. We will help you learn to play to be an effective member of CJ. </p>
<p>To know more talk to our relationship /recruitment officers : Abisynthe or
  Jatina/Guerison. </p>
<p>Application Requirements<br>
  Gear: This is not a huge issue normally. Having shown
  effort in trying to get better gearwise is a plus though as it shows interest
  in progressing yourself.
  You need some form of permanent Enduring Breath, See invisible and Invisibility
  items. You also need a rightclick buff item that works in both indoor and outdoor
zones . </p>
<p>Flags: At the end of your application period, you must have Tipt flag for
  KT flag to be considered for guilding. </p>
<p>Expansions: You must own all current EQ expansions. </p>
<p>Level and AAs: You need the requirements listed below for each class. If you
  are not required to be lvl 70 and you are not lvl 70 must gain one level during
  the application time. If you are level 70 must get atleast 4 AAs during app
  time plus you must have any requirements in AA abilities listed with your class
  [on the website]."</p>

  "Hi, are you interested in joining a guild of perverted folk? Do you place
  more weight on being with friends than playing with asshole players? Than DE
  is
  the place for you! Make certain to list at a minimum, character name, character
  class, level, regular play times, and if you have grouped with any other DE
  Members. General format for joining the guild is by recommendation of existing
  membership, so please make attempts to group with guildmates before applying.
/join JOINDE to try to get members. Applications will be closed after 60 days.</p>
<p>Inside guild, DE typically goes by RL first name. This enables people to be
  able to become a little more familar with one another and at times helps sort
out alts a little bit. </p>
<p>People then tend to give folks more consideration knowing there is a real
  person behind the other keyboard, not just a random character. To make this
  easier in the initial learning of names, in the guild management tool <alt-g> we
  denote everyone using the following methods. REAL NAME - MAIN CHARACTER NAME <MAIN
  GUILD> (if not DE). This is important due to one of the guilds most important
  rules. Treat people like people, treat others how you would wish to be treated,
  don't abuse your family.</p>
<p>We are a family typically **not** made up of children. Childish behavior is
  nothing that is tolerated very long in guild. However, guildchat does range
  from R to X in guild chat. Nothing that a child should be seeing.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended to have a good sense of humor and to not take much
  said in guild to heart. We give one another an immense amount of grief but
  it is almost always being done in jest.</p>
<p>Boobies:<br>
  You must like boobies, either by proxy or be in possession of your own pair.
    You will hear about boobies often enough in guild. Long ago this became a
    standard question and we are gonna keep working with it. Besides, working
    with boobies is fun =). If this offends you. EBPs will probably turn your
    brains to jello.</p>
<p>Raiding:<br>
  Descending Essence is not a "point a gun at you and force you to raid" guild.
  If we did, we would be considered assholes and technically pointing guns at
  folks and making them do things is illegal. When events are called or pre-planned
  the folks that want to go, please go. The folks that do not wish to attend,
  spam about the event in guild is not to make you feel guilty, it is simply
  the easiest way to remind folk who are just logging in that an event is going
on."</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www9.plala.or.jp/ed_web/" target="_blank">Eternal Dreamers</a></strong> <br>
  An Asian guild, website in Japanese.<br></p>

<p><a href="http://www.five-rings.net/viewnews.php" target="_blank"><strong>Five Rings</strong></a><br>
Currently Five Rings is taking new applications. We are looking for all classes
with 150-200 AA's and the Anguish Signets preferred, but we will consider all
exceptional applicants. Gear is not important. Number
  of AA's, dedication, willingness to improve, and most importantly, high playtimes
  are most important. <br>
  Please read through our Steps for applying to Five Rings information message
for more information.</p>
<p>1. You must be able to raid during our primary raiding hours of 6pm - 12am
  Eastern Time <br>
  2. We expect you to be lvl 70 before applying. <br>
  3. 50% raid attendance is the standard minimum for guilding. If your plans
  are to show up consistantly, just to complete your app process, then we see
  a steady decline in your playtimes, the possibility of guild removal is probable. <br>
  4. As a raiding guild, we require members to raid with us when they are online.
  Skipping raids while online is not permissible without a plausible excuse.
  We do not allow members to log on and be afk or not participating in raids
  for extended periods of time. <br>
  5. You must respect other players in the game. We don't want loudmouths, drama
  queens or sociopaths. If you can't control yourself in the game or on our message
  boards (or other public message boards) you will be subject to punishment and
  possibly removal from the guild. <br>
  6. Can you handle failure? Sometimes we will fail 3 times before we succeed
  once. Are you the type of person that will be negative or will you add some
  constructive imput to an encounter? Being negative only brings everyone down
  around you. <br>
  7. You MUST minimally have the Planes of Power, Gates of Discord, Omens of
  War, and Dragons of Norrath expansions. <br>
  8. Apps should have between 150-200 AA's and will be required to pick up raid
  specific AA's defined by guilded members of that class. Exceptions will be
  made depending on the demand for classes. <br>
  9. Being flagged for Anguish and Tacvi with a 200+ AA's is a plus. <br>
  10. If you are not flagged for Anguish, we expect you to be working on getting
  your 7 signets that can be obtained through experience groups. <br>
  11. Can get at least over 130 in all resistance unbuffed. <br>
  12. Download Maps http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/ . You must be able to get around
  places in the game. Complaining about not knowing how to get to certain places
  is not an excuse. It slows us down. Also
  try communicating in group and find out if anyone has the group leader aa (find
  pc). Chances are a person with this skill knows exactly where to be. The illuminated
  path dirrects you right to anyone in your group. <br>
  13. If you are missing some of these requirements, but consider yourself an
  exceptional player, please feel free to contact me (Laldace), and I will discuss
these possabilities with you. </p>
<p>If you do not have LoY or LDoN, the spells are not required, but applicants
  with those expansions and spells will have higher utility on raids than those
without them."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.heroesofluclin.com/modules/news/" target="_blank"><strong>Heroes<br>
</strong></a>"Heroes
  is a relaxed raiding guild that raids every other day. Our motto is RL > EQ
  and raids are not mandatory (we do ask that you participate in our raids if
  you are online). Please join our heroeslfg:lfg channel to listen for
raid announcements and seek out groups with Heroes members. </p>
<p>Interested applicants must contact their class rep (or other officer) to receive
  approval to raid with Heroes. Heroes class reps are as follows:<br>
  - Arjin (clr)<br>
  - Breako (pal/war) <br>
  - Hamysh (bst/shm)<br>
  - Kandam (mnk/sk)<br>
  - Mordra (nec/wiz)<br>
  - Rathanor (enc)<br>
  - Rikkii/Shazar (mag)<br>
  - Skeetz (ber/rog)<br>
  - Tltan (dru)<br>
  - Whirl (brd/rng)</p>
<p>You must attend a minimum of 2 raid days before proceeding with your application.
  Meet and group with as many Heroes as possible. Once your class rep gives you
  the go-ahead, submit your application to applyheroes@yahoo.com. Be sure to
  include your name, level, class, AAs, sponsor, previous guilds, raid experience,
  and the reason you want to apply to Heroes.</p>
<p>All eligible applicants must receive class rep approval, have a sponsor, level
  69, must meet the following AA requirements, and receive the number of recs
  (recommendations) outlined in the demand tier section below:</p>
<p>High Demand = 50 AAs<br>
  Medium Demand = 100 AAs<br>
Low Demand = 150AAs.</p>
<p>The following are our demand tier categories:</p>
<p>High Demand (need 3 Recs)<br>
  - Bard, Beastlord, Cleric, Druid, Magician, Monk, Necro, Rogue, Shaman, Shadowknight,
    Paladin, Wiz</p>
<p>Medium Demand (need 4 Recs)<br>
  - Berserker</p>
<p>Low Demand (need 5 Recs)<br>
  - Enchanter, Ranger, Warrior</p>
<p>You must have basic resist gear. MR/FR/CR should all be above 100 unbuffed.</p>
<p>Applicants will not receive any loot items on raids unless it is a NO DROP
  item that would otherwise rot. Please do not send tells for items you are interested
  in, we will offer it to you if appropriate.</p>
<p>It's not easy to get into this guild. Applications take a minimum of two weeks.
  You have up to 4 weeks to gather recs. Applications without enough recs will
  be closed at the end of 4 weeks unless the class rep grants an extension. We
  strongly encourage that you meet and group with as many Heroes as possible
  and never ask a Heroes member to sponsor or rec you (members will seek you
  out if they are interested in supporting you as an applicant). </p>
<p>Your class rep and sponsor are the main contacts for you during the application.
  Find a sponsor who has a compatible schedule, can keep you informed of Heroes
  events and can help you meet other Heroes.</p>
<p>Once you have all of your recs and have been an official app for at least
  two weeks, you face The Interview. Your class officer will grill you and determine
  whether to extend a guildinvite.</p>
<p>If you survive The Interview, you become a probationary member of Heroes.
  Probation lasts three weeks. You won't be able to sponsor or rec any applicants
  and your alts will not be invited into the guild until probation is over. You
  will only be eligible for raid loot that no full member wants. You become a
  full member at the end of probation.</p>
<p>Members are not allowed to change their 'main' (the character that was accepted
  to the guild) until they have been in the guild for at least 6 months.</p>
<p>Heroes members may sponsor only one person at a time and may only have 3 recs
  on the boards. The sponsorship period starts once the application has been
  posted and finishes once the applicant has completed probation. Heroes officers
  cannot be sponsors, nor do they rec the classes they represent.</p>
<p>Family members of current Heroes may be able to have some of the requirements
  waived. This is on a case-by-case basis, please talk to Whirl or your class
  rep.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact Whirl online or email her at applyheroes@yahoo.com."</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.keepersoftheelements.com/" target="_blank">Keepers of
the Elements</a><br>
</strong>Keepers of the Elements began in the lands of Norrath by a unique group of people.
These fine people adventured forth from a distant land to seek a new world rich
in experiences, opportunities, fun and growth. Rizz Wulfgard bound together these
people in a unit of shared ideals and goals. He formed Keepers of the Elements. </a></p>
<p>Originally, he aspired that each element, earth, wind, water and fire would
  be representative of the various classes in Norrath. Designs have grown but
  yet this concept held true. We now have Armsmasters who preside of these elements
  with class captains who assist members in development, growth, and abilities. </p>
<p>As the guild grew, we needed a recruiting master, a person who is the keeper
  of the very heart of who we are. Our recruiting standards are not measured
  on the class played but on who plays the class, their ability to do well, grow,
  understand our needs, and respect our core values. We care very much about
  each other and want our new members to share our joys and failures as we experience
  this land we call home. </p>
<p>The guild goals are of growth, adventure and enjoyment. We treat each other
  with honor, dignity and respect. We treat other people in our world the same
  yet we hold people and guilds accountable for their actions. We are very prideful
  of our accomplishments. We work very hard to do things alone and without outside
  assistance. We expect more from each member than just someone in attendance.
  We expect a valid contribution. Every member counts. </p>
<p>We are a casual guild. We generally can be found in the lands of Norrath 24/7.
  Our main focus is from 6 p.m. est to 1 p.m. est. We have a member base of over
  100. Yet due to our respect of real life obligations, we generally have 50ish
  members on nightly. We have weekly schedules posted with free days available.
  We have three required raids days per week with two optional raid days that
  can be attended or skipped as you wish. We have goals. We have a generous time
  line to accomplish those goals that allow for the difficulty of finding the
  needed spawns but yet keep us focused on achieving those goals. </p>
<p>We are joined together to have fun. We want to enjoy the multitude of personalities
  entwined in this guild as well as the very game itself. We want to do it honorably
  and with style. We are not a mass zerg force but skilled players working in
  harmony. We often seek unconventional methods since we may not be strong enough
  to accomplish the task in a conventional way. But the goal is the same, work
  together, do our jobs, enjoy the encounter, behave honorably, and have fun. </p>
<p>This is the core of what Keepers of the Elements is. What we were in the very
  beginning and what we are today. This we do not change. Thank you for visiting
  our web page and learning something about who we are. Zelfani Wulfgard, Guild
  Leader, Keepers of the Elements.</p>
<p>KoE is primarily comprised of mature gamers who have RL responsiblities but
  still find the time to log on, kill stuff, and have a great time together.
  We average 2 to 3 raid events per week dependent on circumstances. While most
  of us live in North America, across all time zones, we have players in Europe
and Australia. You can find Keepers on line 24/7. </p>
<p>KoE is over 6 years old, founded on Veeshan. While many of the founding members
  are still with us, new members are essential for the perpetuation of the guild.
  Therefore, we continue to recruit new members. We wear our tag with pride and
  do not grant it lightly. It is not easy to become a Keeper, but the journey
  is well worth the effort.</p>
<p>APPLICANTS MUST NOT BE A CURRENT MEMBER OF ANOTHER LUCLIN GUILD</p>
<p>Dual membership with alternate characters in a guild of significance is not
  allowed. Contact the Recruiting Officer for clarification if necessary</p>
<p>APPLICANTS MUST BE RECOMMENDED BY A KOE GUILD MEMBER AND APPROVED BY THEIR
  CLASS CAPTAINS<br>
  The harmony of the guild is of primary importance. As such, the reputation
  and demeanor of applicants is scrutinized. If you are friends with a Keeper
  then good for you. If not, don't despair. Post your intentions and introduce
  yourself to some Keepers. </p>
<p>The Recruit Team is here to help. For in-game recruiting assisstance please
contact -Tuntun [Recruiting Officer] - Aneron - Saron - Fistinyereyes [Recruiters]."</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=38959&TabID=345217" target="_blank">Kingdom
of Eminence</a></strong><br>Currently rebuilding the guild as of May 2007: "We are currently trying to rebuild Kingdom of Eminence again.  Those of you who would like to join us in bringing the Kingdom back into its previous state of Glory are welcome to come join us on this endevor.  See Fver in game for an invite or just to ask questions if you have any."</p>

<p><a href="http://kratosguild.org/KratosRLP/viewnews.php" target="_blank"><strong>Kratos</strong></a><br>
  Kratos is looking for a few excellent people to round out our raid force. Kratos raids Sunday, Monday and Wednesday, Thursday, starting at 6 p.m. CDT. Depending on our target(s) we can be finished as early as 10 p.m. or as late as 12. We are currently farming Tier 1 and 2 of Demi-Plane of Blood, Daosheen, and Suchun. There are only 2 kills remaining until we are a Deathknell guild.

Recruitment is closed at this time. Keep in mind that Kratos is always looking for a good member. The minimum's for consideration are level 75, 250aa's. Monocle of Blood, Theater of Blood, and Dreadspire keys are a must. Contact any officer or our recruiting team of Dorafo, Ayanor, Harleyquinn, and Photocian for further information. All new applicants are required to look over and read our guild policies."</p>
