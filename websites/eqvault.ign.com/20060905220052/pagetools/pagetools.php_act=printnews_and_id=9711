There's also a layer of optional events that take place if players interact with the event in certain ways, such as helping the War Suppliers collect items, or completing the tasks and quests given out by some of the other races.<br> <br>The optional events are there to give you guys an opportunity to shape the war on your server, to give you something unique to talk about that may be different from other servers, and to ultimately encourage you to participate in the event. The war in Greater Faydark was one of these optional events. The war in Rathe Mountains was anothere. There's a whole group of quests for some races (not for all of them) that can be unlocked if certain criteria are met.<br> <br>Specifically pertaining to the barbarians, if the barbarians were to become involved in the events going on in the world, the players needed to convince their race that there was just cause for them to prepare for war. There were even war-suppliers there to support and aid the cause, requesting supplies to help the armies mobilize faster. The same goes for other races, who may still yet have an impact on events to come.<br> <br>In the case of the barbarians, many of you have noticed and mentioned that the barbarian armies actually assembled themselves in Everfrost. Some players have noted that some armies assembled faster than others, while some still weren't forming at all. Some players even suspected that it was completing the war-suppliers tasks that enabled the barbarian armies. Some players were right.<br> <br>Likewise, there was a relatively large window of opportunity (about 18 days) that began the day the War Suppliers showed up wanting supplies for their armies, and it was due to end at the point where they lost the opportunity to attack the Dark Elves (essentially when the Rathe Mountains event began, you could no longer trigger it.) Any items handed in afterwards would not trigger that specific event, but it does not preclude the triggering of other events that may still be in the works.<br> <br>The Rathe Mountains event may be over or it may not have triggered for some, but there is still more to come, a lot more to come. Some of it is optional, much of it is not. The events have been set in motion and they're about to come to an exciting end. </blockquote><br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 29 July, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9711">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=9711</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 5 15:00:52 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
