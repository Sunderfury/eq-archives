Loremasters say:<br><br>"The Serpent is the great river that flows south from Halas. It quadrasects the Plains of Karana, is joined by the runoff from Winters Deep, and flows south, separating the Desert of Ro from the more fertile lands to the West, finally emptying into the Gulf of Gunthak. The Lifefire River is an offshoot of The Serpent.<br><br>Serpent's Spine is the name of a low mountain range that runs parallel to The Serpent. The Gorge of King Xorbb runs through the Serpent's Spine to connect to the Plains of Karana. The town of Highpass is located in the mountains, and the goblin town of Runnyeye is located under them."<br><br>This area would also include the commonlands tunnel and the zone of Befallen, as well as Kithicor and possibly even Rivervale.<br><br>Additionally, it makes sense that a new revamp of old zones would connect to the newly redesigned Desert of Ro.<br><br>It's all speculation at this point, but perhaps the SOE presentation at E3 will give us more information and prove the guessers right or wrong?</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 12 May, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17415">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17415</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:37:42 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
