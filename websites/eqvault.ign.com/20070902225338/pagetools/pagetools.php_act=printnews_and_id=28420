As you take damage each layer will absorb five strikes before failing. As your armor fails you will take more and more damage."<br><br>Developer Nodyin explained:  "It's a melee guard that goes through 4 stages of protection from 100% down to 25% before fading."<br><br>Nodyin also <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=110120">explained</a> a little more about it in the same thread:<br><br>"In designing this AA I was very conscious of balance concerns. This AA is actually unique in EQ up to this point. I had to have several changes made to the way the spell system and some of the spell effects worked to get this to happen. Part of the issue was changing the spell system so that we could create this AA in a way that would both scale from level 1 to 75 and that wouldn't be overpowered at any point.<br><br>Does it have a gameplay impact? Yes, but not to the extent that it will change the balance of content. Is it useful? I think so, and I hope you agree."<br><br>The refresh time was four hours intially, but has since been changed to 20 hours as are the other veteran reward AAs.<br><br><br><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 13 Apr, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=28420">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=28420</a><br>Printed On: Sun Sep 2 15:53:38 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
