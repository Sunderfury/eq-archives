It is being looked into.  I'm told that by increasing advanced lighting, for now, it should help somewhat with vision problems in the lobby. ...we know it is a problem and it is being worked on."  See above -- this appears to have been fixed with the patch today.<br><br>Old UI: Kytherea: "The UI issue is not a bug.  ...the old UI is no longer updated or supported.  We advised people to use the regular default UI until such time as the creators of the Custom UIs they use have updated them, otherwise parts of the UI may be missing.  I am sure someone out there wil update the old default UI for those die-hard fans that want to continue using it so they can benefit from all the UI bits."<br><br>Music in Freeport: Rashere: "The music is playing in East Freeport, but not West.  Looks like the file that says where to play the music isn't there.  I've asked that it be added to the patcher ASAP so you should have music playing soon."<br><br>Gift of Mana: Rashere: "I'm reluctant to refund the AAs since invariably people will buy them again, get bugged again, and then we're in a situation where we have to refund them every patch.  Every time a refund is done, a whole new set of abilities have to be created which introduces other potential problems.<br><br>The only temporary solution I'd seriously consider is removing AH from the game until GoM can be fixed.  I haven't done it to date because there are a decent number of players out there with AH, but no GoM, and its just swapping one problem for another.<br><br>But, if we can't get a fix for it in place soon, that's likely what I'm going to end up doing."<br><br>Hot Zones Really Not Too Hot: Nodyin: "A "Hot Zone" is a Hot Zone because it has a much higher modifier than it used to have and is one of the highest in the game for that level. It doesn't mean that if you got X exp per hour in the old Hot Zones that you're guaranteed to see the same in another. Mob placement, hitpoints and other dynamics will also come into play."  Kytherea: "I checked on this and the Hot Zones are indeed set to give more experience.  You will not see a huge increase for a single npc kill but it should be noticeable after killing several npcs."<br><br>Just looking at Fungus Grove I just tested it on a Live server. Previous to the change I saw on my character about a 1% gain in level 64 on the character I was using. After the change on the same pull I got about 2%. Sounds about right looking at the data."<br><br>What Classes Got Level 55 Traps and Auras: Rashere: "The level 55 spells are lower level version of traps or auras.  If your class has a level 70 trap or aura, there's a lower level version of it to get as well.  It's simply so that those aren't locked entirely at level 70.  Not all classes got one, though, so if your class doesn't have an aura or trap spell line, there's no lower level version to get."<br><br>The High Hold Keep Mission is Now Ridiculously Hard:  Celrak: "As many of you are now aware, the infamous Highkeep monster mission has been modified. Based on feedback received, we are currently taking another look at this mission with the goal in mind of keeping it on par to other monster missions as far as experience and loot is concerned based on time invested. Expect to see changes to this mission that will once again make it worthwhile to play through, but do not expect to see it reverted back to its previous state. Keep the feedback coming everyone, and keep it constructive! We are here and we are listening."<br><br>Spawn Times Too Long for Level 55 Spell NPC in Chalice Task:  Rashere: "Just looked into this.  It looks like the new data didn't make it out.  I'm having it repatched ASAP.  This will cause a zone repop with a half hour warning.  Once that's done, it should be working as expected."<br><br>You can see what individual players have noticed <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=185418&view=by_date_ascending&page=1">here on the SOE boards thread.</a><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 23 February, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15229">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=15229</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 3:21:00 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
