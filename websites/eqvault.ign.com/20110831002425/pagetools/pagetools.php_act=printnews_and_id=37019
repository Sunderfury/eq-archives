Once we have a long-term fix in for the exploit, we will return the banner and camp functionality to its previous state.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br>Rashere adds:<br><br>"I obviously can't go into the details behind the exploit, but its not related to hacking.  Folks found a loophole in the way banners work and were exploiting it to bypass raid lockouts.  Code is working on closing that loophole, but we needed to shut it down sooner than they'll be able to get a fix in place.  You can still plant banners and get the effects, you just can't teleport to them in those instances for the time being."<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 11 Jan, 2008<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=37019">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=37019</a><br>Printed On: Tue Aug 30 17:24:26 PDT 2011<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
