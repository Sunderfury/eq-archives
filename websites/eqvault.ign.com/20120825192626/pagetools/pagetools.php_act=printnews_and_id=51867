The contest will run from April 17 through May 10, allowing you to go online and nominate the most dedicated SOE player (including yourself) for the title. Who's deserving and why?<br><br><blockquote>Do you know someone who is the poster child for your favorite SOE title? So dedicated to the game, he or she walks around with bloodshot eyes, sleep deprived, wearing his or her favorite wrinkled SOE T-shirt? Does this player stand out as the first person to go beyond the call of duty to help fellow community gamers in and out of the game? If so, you may have the perfect candidate, and we want to know more!  <br><br>To enter the contest, simply submit a 300 word (or less) letter or role-playing story by e-mail to SOEContests@soe.sony.com explaining why this exceptional player deserves to be honored as Player of the Year. You may also include a link to an image (screen capture, artwork, video, or photo) to go along with your entry. See the Official Contest Rules for submission requirements.<br><br>At the end of the contest, up to two lucky winners will receive a trip to Vegas to join us in the festivities. So good luck to everyone, and we look forward to seeing you at Fan Faire!</blockquote> <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/contests/">Read full contest details</a>!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Tuesday, 21 Apr, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51867">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51867</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 25 12:26:26 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
