I have a crapload of great stuff to throw up for you guys.<br><br>It was definately crazy, and a load of fun.  I think the first thing i'm going to throw up is a rundown of the fantastic costume contest - I have many many pictures of all the great EQ-related (and Shrek) costumes.  Should have this up tonight or early tomorrow - then stay tuned for a full fan-faire report Tuesday or Wednesday.<br><br>Stay tuned!</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Sunday, 31 October, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=3025">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=3025</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 13 16:17:55 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
