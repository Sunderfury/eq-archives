Attendees at Fan Faire were treated to an eight minute movie showing zones, some new monsters, and got just a teaser about some of the new features in the expansion.<br><br>The expansion will feature seven static zones and fifteen instanced missions.  The end raiding area, a castle called Darkspire, will have both, so adventurers can just go in and hunt or select a mission in the castle.<br><br>Set in a fog-swirled woodland setting (Nektulos forest?), Darkspire is a gothic-style castle, fantastically detailed with frescoes, elaborate furnishings, stained glass windows and colorful ornamentation that surpasses any architectural details in the game now.  We were told they put more artwork into this zone than they have ever put in any zone in the game, and spent more time on it than they ever had.  The strange formations in the zones viewers had a glimpse of gave hints to dreadful creatures that might lurk within cocoon-looking shapes hanging from the trees.  A more rounded, softer style of artwork dominates this expansion, with lofty ethereal bridges illuminated by gracefully turned lamps stretching up into the forest.  It's not all happy in the forest though, since skulls on pikes seem to hint at a violent undercurrent in this forest community.<br><br>The monsters in the trailer are colorful, with strange mushroom-men and comical robots that I am sure are cute until they quad hit for 1000.  In one of the best sequences in the film, a very frightening white werewolf creature sprang out of the forest at us, slavering with long teeth and huge clawed paws as he reared up on his hind legs.  The concept art suggests that again spiders and even more malevolent creatures are not going to be pleased to see a band of adventurers come to explore the forest depths.<br><br>One of the more interesting features will be that players can play a monster, actually turning themselves into the monster with that monster's attributes.  This concept spans levels so one could change into a level 20 werewolf, for instance, and group with lower level friends.<br><br>If you don't want to help people as a monster, why not just kill them then?  This expansion will also allow you to play an evil monster in a mission, finally making cleric aggro into something personal!<br><br>Another innovative idea for this expansion is "intelligent items."  One's sword or shield will have a mind of it's own, and can either praise or berate you, or even ask to belong to somene else if you just don't cut it.  Which gives a whole new meaning to "only your friends will tell you this."  These items may evolve with the player as well growing in experience as you do.  I am curious to hear more about this aspect of the game.  No drop could become a nightmare if you just don't get along with that intelligent helm....on the other hand you could get quite attached to your trusty sword.<br><br>It was emphatically denied that there would be leveling above 70 in this expansion... does that mean it might happen later? Who knows.<br><br>I am excited to hear more about the expansion as the time to launch grows nearer.  Beta will begin sometime later this month and into July.  They especially are looking for raiding guilds to try out the high end content.<br><br>Screenshots and artwork to come!<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 13 June, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8420">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=8420</a><br>Printed On: Thu Mar 16 5:59:19 PST 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
