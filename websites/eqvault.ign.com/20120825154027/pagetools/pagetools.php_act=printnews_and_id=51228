This is part one of a four-part series.<br><br><blockquote>Are more and more of us secretly buying gold and power-levelling services? Certainly when Mythic (Warhammer Online) boss Mark Jacobs posted on the topic back in autumn last year, he stirred up a huge response.<br><br>"I hate gold sellers/spammers," said Jacobs. "No, that's not strong enough, let me try again. I HATE GOLD SELLERS WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING. Ah, that's better... And now that they have taken their obnoxiousness to new levels with gold service spamming, I HATE GOLD SPAMMERS EVEN MORE NOW THAN EVER BEFORE." He went on, in a highly personal tirade, to claim that "we have been banning these jerks like crazy."<br><br>"We don't wait and let them stay in the game and ban them en masse, my guys ban their useless, time-consuming butts right away. We have a strike team whose sole job it is to get these guys off our servers as quickly as possible." He even introduced a public ban message every time a spammer was kicked. Messages like "Tchar'zanek has ordered the slaughter of [Spammer] and all others of his kind who weaken the Raven Host by providing wealth and power to the unworthy" became commonplace.</blockquote></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 27 Mar, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51228">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51228</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 25 8:40:27 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
