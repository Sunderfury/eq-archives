Attendees are invited to stand in line and step up and ask one question each to the dev team on the panel in the front of the room.  This works pretty well, although there are some people that get in more than one question and lots of people who just ask a question and get right back in line to ask another one.  There’s one particular individual whom I am told gathers questions for months beforehand and patiently stands in line over and over, asking each question in a very articulate way that makes them very clear to the developers.  The developers answer over 100 questions every session.<br><br>Tradeskills and Lore<br> The devs took into consideration all the tradeskill requests, but could not at any time say “yes, we will fix this now” (as has sometimes happened!).  They do take copious notes and look into things after the summit ends, though, so not all hope is lost.  The question of modifying caps came up in this panel, and the dev team promised to look at them.  The question of rogue poisons also came up, and they said they would consider the issue carefully.  The drop rate of clockwork bolts will not be increased; there is no intention of having buff potions stack with player buffs; and they may address stacking issues with rogue spell traps.  The fact that beastlords and a couple of other classes didn’t get an aura was noted; they weren’t supposed to get any but got a spell or a discipline instead.  The dev team also commented that titles for a starting city should be in game and they would look into that.<br><br>The panel specifically to address Prophecy of Ro had the most questions on traps and auras.  Players wanted the devs to understand the issues they had with lag, the issues with auras and pets, and how the traps aggroed things under the z axis.  The discussion centered around taking examples of when these things were happening, as well as questions about warping issues in Devestation and tributable gear.<br><br>The Future of EQ panel mentioned the new expansion coming out, which will be complete in a boxed set with prior expansions, and encourage people to level from 1-75 in the entire expansion.  Expect to see the new shader textures and artwork in this new expansion.  This expansion will feature a new starting city as well.  No expansion name or geographical area was mentioned in my hearing.    There will also be the introduction of a new “Progressive Server,” which will be no transfer and open up all of the previous expansions as players discover them through quests and conquering difficult mobs.  There are still many details to be worked out on how exactly this will be done, but the concept sounds very interesting and workable.  No boats though, those are broken and can’t be fixed.  Not to say that there weren’t complaints about that already!<br><br>Class Balance<br> No one actually got injured in this panel, which I think made it a rousing success.  That isn’t to say that voices weren’t raised occasionally and comments didn’t elicit cheers from the fans.  We all wondered if it might end Jerry Springer style, but everyone kept their cool for the most part.<br><br>The dev team tried to make it very clear that there was no Phase II of class balance; it’s an ongoing process and they look at the classes every day in relation to one another and to the game’s direction.<br><br>The conflicts among the various classes have no clear answer.  A rogue stood up and said, “We need more clicky illusion items in game”.  Dev answer: We just put a new clicky illusion item in game and we aren’t planning on putting any more in at the moment, because Enchanters are supposed to be the “masters of illusion.”  Five minutes later, the enchanter got to the front of the line and made an impassioned plea to have click-illusion items removed from the game!  (Answer is: No).<br><br>Here’s a quick run-down on what each class had to say:<br><br>Monks: “Monks can’t pull as well as bards.”  That’s right, Bards have fading memories and it’s a problem.<br><br>Paladins:  make their stuns actually work.  This is being looked at seriously.<br><br>Wizards:  we need more DPS for longer; necros do twice the damage of a wizard; we want our clicky legs back (no.).  I see the nerf bat hovering over the necros because the wizards did make a pretty good argument about how they are limited by aggro and mana.  Wizards also want a snare that doesn’t self-snare.  They also complained about their lack porting utility (as a way to make money); an offhand comment was thrown out about changing the timers on GH ports ……we’ll see.<br><br>Rogue:  they may change the skill-up rates on traps; Nerves of Steel should be not resisted at all, so they are going to look at that.<br><br>Ranger: they want a bow AA.  The devs explained that the goal for archery was 85% of dual wield, and they have upgraded several high end bows with this in mind.  Endless quiver is a problem and quite overbalancing.  There was also a question about Beastlords taking less damage than a better equipped ranger; BL’s seem to have a much higher avoidance than rangers.  The devs were going to look into that.<br><br>Cleric:  we are bored.  Can we have more fun?  Answer: not really, you are a needed class and you get to go on every raid.  There was the usual complaint that druids and shaman can heal better, too (shammys have canni so have unlimited mana), but it really fell on unsympathetic ears from the devs, I thought.<br><br>Druids: we are obsolete.  No dev had much to say about that complaint.<br><br>Shaman:  the resists at the high levels are too high, they have 70-80% resists.  No spells have modifiers.  Speaking of healers, the devs pointed out that Shaman AC has a higher cap than druids do, and a plate class has more mitigation.  They also wanted an upgrade to Turgors, but that’s not going to happen because it would trivialize content (it has a slow component), but they could give a situational upgrade.<br><br>ShadowKnights:  Harm touch needs to scale up.  The devs will look into it, and possibly solve it with an AA.<br><br>Bezerker:  they have DPS issues.  From 30-60 they have no real class utility, and then at 70 get tremendous DPS with no aggro reduction.  They die and then have an endurance regen problem.  Rashere wanted to know from the Beastlord how he might solve this problem—Aas at lower levels? Better items at lower levels?  This was not resolved and the question-asker stepped down, unsatisfied it appeared with the lack of quick answer.<br><br>Beastlords: they need better pet focus at higher levels.  The devs agreed that all pets were potentially a problem and should be able to tank in a raid situation.  They also mentioned that pet focus is 30% more power than the base line focus.<br><br>Enchanters:  They had some serious complaints about their class utility.  The devs admitted that charm was not working as intended but warned it was a complicated issue to resolve, so that fix isn’t coming soon I would guess.  They also listened to the complaints that enchanters weren’t specialized enough for either buffs, DPS, or crowd control, but didn’t agree they needed to be more spcialized in any of those areas.  The devs did agree to look into adding some more “Enchanter useful” raid content – but warned it might not be soon or ever and then launched into a discussion about the difficulty of trying to design mez encounters that could not be defeated by a Bard.  Enchanters also wanted faction back in illusions, at least the self-illusions.  <br><br>Warriors wanted the taunt fix to happen sooner – taunt is being fixed we are told -- and work done on Call of the Challenge.<br></span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 10 April, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16541">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16541</a><br>Printed On: Fri Sep 1 20:26:54 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
