The changes include: <br><br>The Character Transfer Service with items for moving from server to server, from account to account, from account to account on a different server for 1 character has been lowered from $75 to $50 per character. However, the discount for multiple character transfers is no longer available.<br><br>The Character Transfer Service without items is no longer available. <br><br>If you desire to transfer a character or characters from your primary account to your secondary account on a different server, or wish to transfer to a different server during non server split opportunities, the following service is offered. This is a value added service which requires a fee that can be billed to your credit card. <br><br>This service may end or be modified at any time without prior notification. </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 10 Aug, 2007<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31915">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=31915</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 24 12:07:32 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
