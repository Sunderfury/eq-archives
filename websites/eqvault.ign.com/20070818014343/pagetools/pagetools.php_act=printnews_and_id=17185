You will have to pay a little more for the priviledge now:<br><br>CUSTOMER SERVICE NOTIFICATION<br><br>We will be increasing our Station Access subscription rate in June. Effective June 1, 2006, the new monthly subscription rate will be $24.99/month. While this announcement may be unpleasant, we have added several games to the Station Access subscription package and the cost of operating the game service for the games included in the Station Access subscription package has increased significantly since we launched Station Access. This change will help us achieve our goal of seeing that every player has a consistently enjoyable experience in our game worlds. You don’t have to do a thing; you will automatically be migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription plan when your current subscription plan expires. Subscription rates are subject to tax and value-added taxes, as applicable.<br><br>For more detailed information on the Station Access subscription package, please go to www.stationaccess.com. </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 3 May, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17185">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17185</a><br>Printed On: Fri Aug 17 18:43:43 PDT 2007<br>©2007 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
