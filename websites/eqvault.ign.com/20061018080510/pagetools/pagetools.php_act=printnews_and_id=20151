With the next generation of dragons lost forever, Veeshan's bloodline was in jeopardy.Six dragons who were children of the Nest proposed a plan to their elders -- the creation of a race to protect dragons and the Wyrmqueen's bloodline, something they had seen done once before.<br><br>The six dragons were scoffed at by the elders of the Nest, but they were so adamant with the idea that the elder dragons ordered their exile so their ideas would not gain a foothold.  To the elders, it was unthinkable.  The six left the Nest and ignored the decree of the elders.  They settled in the nearby Serpent Spine Mountains to carry out their plan to create a new race to protect the existence of Veeshan's bloodline on Norrath.  They would create a race of dragon-touched humans and call them Drakkin which means “Dragon Child” in the language of the elders.<br><br>They called themselves the Circle of the Crystalwing, defining them as the future of dragonkind.  The six dragons in the Circle:  Venesh the Greenblood; Draton`ra, Master of the Void; Keikolin, Bringer of Enlightenment; Mysaphar, Seeker of All; Atathus the Red Lord; and Osh`vir the Windspirit. <br><br>In human form, the dragons traveled to Freeport and combed through the taverns and inns, looking for the right humans to suit this new race. The honorable dragons found many who sympathized with their plight and plans and agreed to help right the wrongs that mortals inflicted on dragons of the Nest by unleashing Venril's curse.  Many humans considered it a great honor. The darker dragons were not so willing to negotiate and simply took the human subjects they desired. Each human taken was touched by the magic of a single drop of dragon’s blood across their cheek.<br><br>In only a matter of months, the dragon-touched humans began to experience changes, a coming-of-age that became known as the Awakening. It is then that the latent strengths they inherit from their dragon bloodline surface and they have a burning desire to better understand them.  Their hair takes on new texture and color – the same color as the dragon who touched them.  Parts of their skin show small, toughened scales, and runic patterns representing their new race began to show on their face, torsos and legs – all in the color of their dragon progenitor.  Delicate horns appear in patterns on their foreheads. They are the essence of beauty to most who see them.<br><br>As their new traits develop, the drakkins yearn to meet their parents. They find themselves on a pilgrimage into the Serpent Spine Mountains. Their final destination is the ancient abandoned ogre city of Nokk, now alive with drakkin who call it Crescent Reach.<br><br>As they enter the Dragon’s Grove of the great stone city where their parents await them, their human past is lost forever. It is from their parents that the drakkin learn their purpose – to live and grow stronger to protect the future of Veeshan's bloodline on Norrath.  With their new identity affirmed, their drakkin life truly begins.<br><br><br><a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/image.php?ss=657"><br><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=657"</a><br><br><a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/image.php?ss=658"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=658"></a><br><br><a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/image.php?ss=659"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=659"></a><br><br><a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/image.php?ss=660"><img src="http://eqvault.ign.com/screenshots/thumb.php?ss=660"></a></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 11 August, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20151">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=20151</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 1:05:12 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
