Of course the game has changed a ton over the years, here's a little chunk on some of those changes.<br><br><blockquote><i>Has the game become “easier” in some ways and let us know how/why?</i><br><br><b>Jonathan Caraker:</b> We’ve made a point of removing many of the artificial roadblocks, excessively punitive penalties, and confusing mechanics over the course of the EverQuest’s lifespan. With little exception, I feel these changes were for the greater good. Adding in-game maps, showing Tradeskill formulae, not destroying items in a Tradeskill container for a bad combination, reducing experience loss on death, reducing experience necessary to acquire levels and AAs, allowing players to keep items on death, and displaying quest objectives in the game’s quest interface are but a few of the examples of our attempts to make the game as accessible as possible while still maintaining the level of challenge that EverQuest is known for.</blockquote></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Wednesday, 1 Apr, 2009<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51372">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=51372</a><br>Printed On: Mon Aug 22 13:19:09 PDT 2011<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
