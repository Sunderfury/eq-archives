The developers at Sony Online are trying to make their world more user-friendly, akin to what they dubbed the "modern" MMORPGs out there. In an attempt to minimize downtime out of combat, the regeneration rates of health and other parameters will be dramatically increased. For high level players, this will mean standing around for about three minutes, as opposed to the exorbitant amount of time required before for inter-battle breaks. Death is also being given some attention; it'll now involve less needless zoning. As another tweak, the skill purchase system, previously available only to high level players, will be accessible to lower levels, appropriately scaled down.<br> <br>The build we saw was running The Serpent Spine's beta server, and we got a chance to check out bits of Crescent Ranch. Players can expect a bunch of new quests and merchants there. It's apparently an abandoned ogre city, so much of the architecture is colossal compared to the players running around. Players can even visit some titanic dragon lords who've taken up residence in a section of the city. Most of those running around had picked the Drakkin race. Being the first characters created using the updated graphics engine from two years back, they're more detailed than most other EQ races. Each has scale-like patterns along their ribs, horny protrusions along their foreheads, and significant tattoo patterns. The color patterns of all the features can be altered in the character creator, depending on which dragon sire players choose to align their character with.<br><br>More than anything, Sony Online was stressing how this expansion is poised to bring together lower level characters for intricate boss and dungeon encounters. We checked out a dusky, craggy zone called Direwind where a gnoll stood amid a series of totems. This wasn't an instances boss encounter, rather an outdoor, static raid or party target. In order to take down the gnoll, players had to interact with the totems while conducting the battle. These kind of fights where parties are forced to manipulate environmental objects while in combat is repeated in numerous other areas. In the Blightfire Moors, a zone just outside Crescent Ranch, there's a tower encounter, again non-instanced. This time, it's a bunch of torches against the room's walls that need to be manipulated in order to prevent the phantom boss from summoning more allies."<br><br>Sounds good, doesn't it?  You won't have to wait much longer to check it out for yourself.</div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 11 September, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21059">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=21059</a><br>Printed On: Wed Oct 18 0:17:37 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
