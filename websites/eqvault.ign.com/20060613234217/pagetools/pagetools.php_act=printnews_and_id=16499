It makes sense that a new starting city would follow from an expansion release where you can go level from 1- 70 (75 now!) in the same expansion.<br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Saturday, 8 April, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16499">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=16499</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 13 16:42:17 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
