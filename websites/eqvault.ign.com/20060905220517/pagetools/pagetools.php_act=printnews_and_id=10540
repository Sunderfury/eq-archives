Ideally, we'd like players to walk out of the tutorial at 10, do the various quests in POK until 20, and then hit LDoN for a good portion of their 20-40s for directed play. To accomplish this, however, the point system (or the cost of items, really) needs to be changed so that you get enough points to buy items before you level. Currently in LDoN, players will outgrow the items they are trying to save up for by doing LDoN adventures, because they level up faster than they can save.<br> <br>I'll be looking at the post-50 LDoN points/rewards, but my main goal is to make LDoN a viable place for new players to meet up and play in."<br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Monday, 29 August, 2005<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10540">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=10540</a><br>Printed On: Tue Sep 5 15:05:17 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
