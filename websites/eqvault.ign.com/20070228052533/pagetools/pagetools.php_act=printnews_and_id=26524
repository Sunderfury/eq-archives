EverQuest The Buried Sea is available only via digital download, for the suggested retail price of U.S. $29.99 at www.station.com<br> <br> “The Buried Sea is the thirteenth expansion for EverQuest, which is coming up on its eighth anniversary next month, will not only provide players with new missions and content, but will continue to challenge players with two new worlds to explore,” said Christopher E. Sturr, Senior Global Brand Manager, Sony Online Entertainment.<br> <br> The Buried Sea introduces players to a new type of inventory slot called a Power Source which is used for new equipment available in the expansion, known as an Energeian Power Source. Energeian Power Sources are similar to a magical battery and come in a variety of types such as: fire, cold and light. Within the expansion, a new type of armor is available called Energeiac Armor which, while relatively basic by itself and suitable for a player to wear out in Norrath, is built to be powered by an Energeian Power Source and comes into its full power when that is the case. For example, when a fire-magic power source is equipped the armor gains offensive stats, increasing stamina, strength, and endurance but weakens the wearer’s ability to resist cold-based attacks. Power sources can be changed  out at any time, allowing the player to quickly customize their entire armor set to best match the conditions they are fighting in.<br> <br> “In addition to the Energeian Power, players will also be actively involved in the gameplay of this expansion from creating their own guild banners to participating in ship-to-ship combat on the open seas against swash-buckling pirates,” said Clint Worley, Producer, Sony Online Entertainment.<br> <br> About EverQuest The Buried Sea<br> <br> Throngs of undead trample the earth both night and day as Norrath's sun withers. With each passing hour, the growing numbers of creatures of the night rising from crypts and graves seem part of a grand design to overwhelm the lands. Trouble also lurks deep beneath The Buried Sea off the coast of Odus in a city named Katta Castrum, which has remained undiscovered for millennia. It is a city built to sustain the beloved leader of the Combine Empire who was poisoned. Generations of Combine Loyalists have tried to cure and awaken him while they house threatened populations of Kedge, Shissar, and Sphinx. But in recent times, the artifact that powers and protects their city has weakened. Without it, the city will be crushed under the pressure of the sea. Only the most intrepid Norrathians have  the power to save them.<br> <br> EverQuest The Buried Sea Features<br> <br> * Ship-to-Ship Combat – Cross the plank and fight for your life on the open seas as you raid pirate vessels!<br> * Two Paths of Advancement – Battle pirates on the open seas or dive deep beneath the sea to Katta Castrum, lost stronghold of the Combine Empire.<br> * New Missions – Take your group through more than 60 challenging new missions ranging from defending merchant vessels against marauding pirates to uncovering the secrets behind the combine city and the danger that threatens it!<br> * Guild Banners – Design a guild emblem and display it with pride!
