You are not wrong.  Normal experience has not been changed, but AA experience has a new formula, which is causing some concern with the player base.  Rashere and the rest of the team have been working on it, but it still has not been resolved in its entirety as of the writing of this article. <br><br>The issue was first noticed around the end of September, when a thread began in the <a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&message.id=295729&view=by_date_ascending&page=1">Veteran’s Lounge</a> on the EQPlayers boards.  Messages such as this one from Azyl were typical:<br><br>"After the TSS patch, but prior to today's patch, my level 65 SK was getting approximately 29-30% AA per 10 kills in a level 65 Unrest mission.  The group was the SK, a 65 cleric, and a 66 mage (68 enchanter assisting but not grouped due to the highest in group AAXP nerf).  <br><br>As of today the same group (same levels, chanter still out of group) got 23-24% of an AA.  That puts the AAXP nerfage at about 20%.  Whee! On the plus side, at least LotD is working on AAXP again."<br><br>In response developer Rashere posted on October 3:<br><br>"… the current disparity between how AA XP is split up in a group situation and how normal XP is split up in a group will be fixed with tonight's patch [October 3]. … The base AA XP the NPC is worth is based on the con of the NPC to the highest level in the group.”<br><br>He also explained:<br><br>"The amount of AA XP you get for a kill hasn't changed since the launch of TSS.  What has changed are a few fixes to bugs in the calculations that threw off things for a bit.  First, Lesson of the Devoted wasn't working on AAs.  That was fixed with the last patch.  Second, when in a group, everyone except the person who actually got kill credit was getting AA XP as if they were solo.  The poor guy who got kill credit was getting the normal group share.  That's was also fixed with the last patch.<br> <br>There are two distinct problems outstanding with the new AA formula that can make things be a bit off from what they used to be and two distinct changes coming that will address them.  <br> <br>First, the way that AA experience is split up in a group is changing to be based on how normal experience would be split up in that same group.  This will stop the drastic dropoff you get currently when grouping with a higher level player.  This change is going out with tonight's patch.<br> <br>Second, we're changing the AA values to be more granular instead of being the same for all NPCs in a con range.  As the NPCs level gets higher within the con range, the amount of AA XP its worth scales up as well.  This change is a bit more complex and won't make tonight's patch.  For the time being, I'm bumping up the amount of AA XP you get for the light blue and green con range to represent NPCs higher in that con range.  One thing to be aware of is that this does mean that NPCs low in the con range will be worth more AA XP than they should for a time and when we put the change to granularity in, they'll go back to the amount of XP they should be giving."<br><br>Wolfenlord commented:<br><br>"Thanks for the reply Rashere, but it doesn't address issues with dark blue mobs at all. The exp value is too low even on mobs within the 5 level bonus range. I'm not out farming greens and light blues, I'm killing lvl 73+ mobs and getting half the exp I did for them pre-TSS. Going up five levels should lower exp some, but 50% drop is extreme."<br><br>Rashere responded: "That's the lack of granularity I'm talking about.  NPC give the exact same AA in the new system as it did in the old if you're looking at the NPCs that make up the point the con range is based on.  For an easy example, an even con solo kill in direwind at level 70 gives 13.59% AA XP in the old system and 13.59% AA XP in the new system.  The problem is that when there's a wide range of values in a single con, all the NPCs are getting the same value so if you're fighting things high in the range, they're not giving as much XP as they used to.  That's the second fix I mentioned above."<br><br>Prex-Atlane asked:<br><br>"A level 68 and a 75 are duoing, both on 100% aa xp.  They kill a level 69 mob.  (For sake of argument assume that the 68 gets 35% of the xp and 75 gets 65% of the xp due to level difference.  I don't know the real ratios).<br><br>Does this mean<br><br>a) The 68 gets 35% of a "Level + 1" mob, and the 75 gets 65% of a "Level - 6"  (ie each person gets xp based on mob lvl vs their own)<br><br>b) The 68 gets 35% of a "Level - 6" mob, and the 75 gets 65% of a "Level - 6" mob (ie each person gets xp based on mob lvl vs highest in group)<br><br>c) The 68 gets 50% of a "Level - 6" mob, and the 75 gets 50% of a "Level - 6" mob (ie each person gets xp based on mob lvl vs highest in group, But the xp is split evenly)?"<br><br>Rashere responded:  “This gets a bit complicated.   The XP split is the key to the whole thing so it’s important to know the exact split here and it's not 35/65.  The NPC is within the 5 level range of the level 68 giving him a bonus to experience, but it’s not within that range of the level 75.  <br><br>The easiest way to look at this is as if from the standpoint of the NPC's base experience.  Every NPC is worth a certain, set amount of base experience based on the NPCs level.  In this particular case, when the NPC dies, the level 75 gets 71% of that experience.  Due to the bonuses the level 68 gets for the NPC being one level higher than him, though, the level 68 gets 177% of the NPCs base experience.  We now use this information to determine how to split up AA XP.<br><br>The base amount of AA XP that each person gets is based on the con of the creature to the highest level in the group and then is split up based on how the normal experience was split.  It works very similar to how normal experience does.  The level 75 gets 71% of the base AA experience for the kill and the level 68 gets 177% of the base AA experience for the kill.”<br><br>Rashere posted some earlier clarifications in September:<br><br>“for reference, AA experience uses the exact same ratio for what an NPC gives based on its level compared to you that normal experience uses...which is the same one it used before the change too.  No changes were made to that at all.<br><br>What was changed was that the system is now based around the NPCs relative level compared to you rather than its straight level and it's a bit less granular than just using pure level.  So, some NPCs are worth a bit more than they were before and some NPCs are worth a bit less...and you'll never hear the complaints about the NPCs that are now worth more AA XP than they were before.”<br><br>Furthermore ...<br><br>“After checking into the examples and comparing old vs. new, the difference I'm seeing is due to the loss of granularity with the new system versus the old.  The new system is based largely on con so NPCs of different levels end up being worth roughly the same amount.  This is making the tougher NPCs within a con range worth less than they were before, which doesn't make a lot of sense and isn't something I'm particularly fond of. <br><br>I'm going to make a change to the system to bring back this granularity under the new relative difficulty system which will correct this issue and make it worthwhile to fight higher level NPCs within the same con again.<br><br>The new AA system uses the maximum level in the group to determine how much XP to give out.  The NPCs are probably just out of the dark blue range for the highest level in the group so you're getting the blue experience instead.<br><br>The change we're going to make to add more granularity is also going to change that calculation, though.  Essentially, we're going to give out AA xp based on what split of the NPCs normal experience you got rather than a set amount based on con difference.  This will cause the AA XP to mimic normal experience scaling in a group to a much higher degree but will keep the relative amounts in place that are the core reason for the change.<br><br>I apologize that this wasn't changed previously.  These problems didn't come up in beta, but after looking at the examples given here, the problems are obvious and we'll get them fixed as quickly as possible.”<br><br>As of October 13, however, things had not been fixed to the players’ satisfaction. Anifee posted, “Am I to understand that at level 51+ I am suppose to start earning AA points faster than at 70? Since my 72 paladin sucks I wanted to make a warrior and build him up good with AA's at 51-55 (maybe a few hundred) and then go up to 75. Is AA XP not working that way atm? Isnt that how it was suppose to work?”<br><br>Since there has been no response so far from the developers, Leana Soulwarden  posted this clarification:<br><br>“The developers advertised that AA experience would be based around an average level 70 group killing even con mobs.  The rate should be adjusted per level, so level 51s killing even con mobs should gain AAs at the same rate as level 70s.  This would be faster than it was in the past, since level 70 players can kill faster than level 51 players.<br><br>Unfortunately, this has not been realized.  From all reports, AA experience for level 51 players is actually slower than it was, not faster.  I would expect the rate to be tuned.<br><br>One thing that aggravates this is that AAs were not treated the same as normal experience when it comes to group level mix.  The AA experience rewarded to the group is based on the con of the mob to the highest level player in the group, not the monster level.  So, if your group has a diverse level range, then the lower level players will receive a lesser reward than they would normally expect.  The devs have stated that this will be changed in a future patch.”<br><br>When that patch will roll out is anyone’s guess.    I think one concept we can take away from this issue is the more changes the devs try to make, the more complicated it gets trying to balance out those changes so a “nerf” doesn’t occur and no one gets more or less experience than they are supposed to get in any given situation.  Let’s hope this one gets resolved to the players’ satisfaction and the game’s overall playability.</span></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Friday, 13 October, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=22151">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=22151</a><br>Printed On: Tue Oct 17 23:50:31 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
