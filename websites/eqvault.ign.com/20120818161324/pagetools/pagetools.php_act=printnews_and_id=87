See it <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/news/news_story.php?id=107444">here</a>.  Here's a sneak peak: <blockquote><hr noshade/><i>"<b>Just lately we've seen a number of big-name projects being cancelled. When news of another one going under breaks, how does that affect you guys?<br><br>Sites:</b> Initially it's very frustrating because we still believe at this point that the more quality MMOs that come out, the better. Every time a new game comes out, we maintain our subscriber base, but they gain a new one and that just helps to grow the market, it gets more people interested in MMOs. So the more quality games that come out the better, although there is something to be said about there being something like over a hundred MMOs currently being in development."</i><hr noshade/></blockquote> Enjoy! <br><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/EQ2_General_Board/b22210/72930379/?0">[Post A Comment]</a><br><br></div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 29 Jul, 2004<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=87">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=87</a><br>Printed On: Sat Aug 18 9:13:24 PDT 2012<br>©2008 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
