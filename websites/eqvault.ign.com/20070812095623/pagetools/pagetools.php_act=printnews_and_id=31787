She runs her cow-person around the starting town, hits birds and pretends that everyone she sees is her friend. We don't have to pay attention to her. Win-win all around. <br><br>Think about it. It's called endgame content for a reason. End. Game. You are at the END of the GAME. Why are you still playing!?!?!? <br>The other day, I asked her if she was winning. She said, "Daddy! This is not a winning game! You can't win!" <br><br>Then I asked her what you do in the game instead. After some thought, she said, "Nothing." <br><br>Sometimes children are wise beyond their years. <br><br>This column is a gesture of support to my fellow gamers, the hardcore, the people who live, eat and breathe role-playing games. You spend all your time playing them. I spend all my time writing them. Two vines that sprout from the same perverted seed. <br><br>You may play a massively multiplayer RPG like EverQuest or World of Warcraft or whatnot. You play it a lot. You get to the maximum level, seeing lots of neat stuff along the way. But then, you hit the ceiling. The only way to advance is by raiding, or running through the same dungeon again and again, or spending many an hour working on your tradeskills, or doing PvP until all possible surprises have been drained from it and even your fellow humans are as predictable and tiring as the robotic enemies in the dungeons. <br><br>In other words, you have reached what is called endgame content. You're at the top, and the only way to get stronger involves many hours and much pain. <br><br>Here is some free advice for you. <br><br>Don't do it. <br><br>Endgame content is stupid. <br><br>Think about it. It's called endgame content for a reason. End. Game. You are at the END of the GAME. Why are you still playing!?!?!? <br><br>Once you are at the maximum level in a game, you put yourself in the most gruesome position imaginable. Your portion of the market is large enough that the game companies will continue to design the occasional degrading and time-consuming treadmill to keep your 15 bucks a month coming in. But your portion of the market is too small for them to actually care about you. <br><br>That means, among other things, poorly balanced raid dungeons that have received only the barest touch of a beta-tester's gentle hand. They will only test the mega-dungeon enough to make sure playing it won't actually launch the space bar on your keyboard into your carotid artery, and then it will be deemed non-broken enough to burn 80 hours of your life. <br><br>Don't like it? Try threatening to quit the game and see how far you get. Even if they believed you (and they don't), there are too few people like you for them to care. <br><br>There are many forces that will pull you to keep playing. You may want to support your guild and help other members to advance. You may want the glory of putting your accomplishments up on its website. But here's an ugly secret. Nobody who knows you through a game actually cares if you live or die. <br><br>If you stopped logging in one day, here is what would happen. Nothing. Then, two months later, someone would say, "Hey, what happened to Laygolas?" and someone else would say, "Dunno, dude. Whatever." And you would never be thought of again. <br><br>Meanwhile, you've spent two months slowly starving in your basement, trapped under the Alienware rig that fell on you, sustained only by the vermin you were able to lure into your mouth using your tongue as bait. <br><br>Thanks a lot, role-playing game.<br><br>You might continue to play out of an obsessive-compulsive desire to be the best, to beat everything, to WIN. This will never work. They own the treadmill. They can always make it longer. Remember EverQuest? It came out in 1999? Soon, it will have its FOURTEENTH expansion. The most recent one is so hard that, months after its release, only a teeny tiny portion of the surprisingly large number of people who still play that game have seen the end of it. <br><br>Are you determined to win the game, to show that you can beat every encounter? The people who collect your money love people like you. They will crush you. <br><br>That fresh, exciting feeling when the world is new, you enter new areas all the time and you can actually be surprised occasionally... it can still happen! You can even gain levels again!!!<br><br>And finally, you might be having fun. Hey, anything is possible. In between the constant death, the guild drama, the tedium, the doing the same dungeon dozens of times, and the hunting for money to repair damaged equipment, you might still have a few flashes of fun and excitement. <br><br>I can't argue with that. But you know something? You could be having more fun! It's your leisure time. Make the most of it! <br><br>When you stop being part of the happy masses and become part of the endgame, go to the next game. That fresh, exciting feeling when the world is new, you enter new areas all the time and you can actually be surprised occasionally... it can still happen! You can even gain levels again!!! <br><br>If you're playing World of Warcraft and you're level 70, stop. Get The Lord of the Rings: Legends of Angmar. It's fun. And when you're maxed out in that and you find that the treadmill goes ever on and on, from the road where it began? By that time, Conan or Warhammer or a new World of Warcraft expansion will be out, and one of those should be fun. <br><br>Learn from the wise. After a long break, Eddie, my 15-year old brother in law, is playing World of Warcraft again. He made a level one character. He has announced that he is going to burn his way top-speed to level 70 and see all the good stuff. And then, he is going to quit and get on with his life. <br><br>I tell you.
