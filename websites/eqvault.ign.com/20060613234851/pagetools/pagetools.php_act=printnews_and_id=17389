We will be updating our Test Server on Monday, May 15. At that time (or preferably before), everyone on Test Server will need to upgrade to the latest DirectX run times. This can be done by simply going to MicroSoft, and following the instructions there. <br><br>We would like to extend an invitation to those who normally don't play on the test server to upgrade and login to the Test Server after Monday's update. The more people we have testing the new version, the sooner we can get these upgrades out to everyone.<br><br>Please post any problems you encounter on the Tech Support forum. If possible, please include what graphics card you have installed and what driver version you are running with in the post. We will be monitoring this forum very closely to catch and fix any related issues as quickly as possible. <br><br>-- Fairan<br>Lead Programmer<br>EverQuest Live<br> </div><p><div classs=copyright><font face=arial size=2 color=#959595>News Story from EverQuest Vault -- EQ <br>News Date: Thursday, 11 May, 2006<br>Link: <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17389">http://eqvault.ign.com/fullstory.php?id=17389</a><br>Printed On: Tue Jun 13 16:48:51 PDT 2006<br>©2005 IGN Entertainment</font></span>
