Blizz has talked about wanting to go back to more of a TBC level of difficulty...did they deliver (assuming it isn't all nerfed to hell), or is this just WOTLK 2.0?  Anyone in the beta want to give some feedback?  This is something probably a lot of PVE players have really wanted to know...will there actually be a challenge?<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Behold the power of procrasti</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Here's hoping that they find a happy medium between TBC and Wrath -- Wrath was too easy, while TBC was too hard to meet the requirements for your first few heroics. <br /> <br />I remember lots and lots and lots and lots of Normal dungeons just to meet the minimum requirements to even get into the easier heroic dungeons in TBC; but then nobody (who had came and geared up before me) wanted normals because they didn't get anything out of them. <br /> <br />In Wrath, anyone with the starting blues could easily clear most of the non-FH heroics, but the dungeons themselves required little thought or skill (the occasional gimmick fight, but nothing really challenging). <br /> <br />In Cata, what I'd like to see is TBC-style dungeons, but yet Wrath's system of allowing people to perform in those heroics after a modest amount of gear-gathering (full set of craftables allowing one to be almost-heroic-ready). <br /> <br />For those players of lesser skill (or those who don't have time to farm up money for those craftable BoEs), they could grind normals a little for a few upgrades before getting into their first heroics. <br /> <br />That'd be the best way to do it IMO. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 22nd 2010  3:59pm by Lyrailis </span></i></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">It'd be nice if they were at least a little more challenging than Wrath's current Heroics, but not as bad as TBC (and God help us if Blizzard makes instances super-huge again.)  At least, speaking from a healing point of view.  I've been doing random TBC instances with my druid lately, and no matter how often I tell people to try avoiding the bombs in Blood Furnace, DPS ignore me, the Tank doesn't move the mobs, and it's a fight to keep them all alive.  Clothies die super fast....there've been a few times where I've started casting Regrowth on the tank, and a cloth dps starts taking damage and is dead before it finishes.  It's ridiculous.  Part of me wonders if I could heal better, but another part wonders why caster DPS is standing that close to the mobs/bombs anyway. <br /> <br />I'd say a happy medium, too, would be if Heroics had more than just a level requirement.  In TBC you had to farm rep to get Keys to the Heroic versions of the instances.  I'd hardly say someone ought to be Exalted with a difficult-to-get faction (there's only so many times I'll run an instance for ANYTHING before I start to wonder why I'm <i>paying</i> Blizzard to do something I hate), but maybe Revered...something high enough where you need to have learned the instances and had the chances to get the gear while there. <br /> <br />Gearscore also needs to be removed from the game, or at least the Blizzard version of it.  There's been a few occasions where a dual-spec player will enter an instance with great gear for one spec, but then switch to the other and need to be carried.  Blizzard's gear-checker thing only recognizes your highest gear value to date, not what you have on at the moment.  If the dungeons kicked players for no longer meeting gear requirements, then I may take back the need to remove the system.  It's especially important for healers and tanks to be able to do their jobs effectively in a difficult instance.  The second they're under-geared, they are under-prepared to do that job.  HP and MP pools disintegrate, and the chances for wiping go way up.  It's frustrating.  Many times have I loathed to remain in an HHoR group that turns out to have a barely-4k GS Tank, only to leave in the middle of an obvious wipe before imminent death...although I'll always give teams that stick around past the doorway a chance to finish.  I hate leaving before we're done, but dammit, I hate paying unnecessary repair bills, too. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />TL;DR: Bring back rep requirements for Heroic keys.  Remove Blizzard's gear value system for entering dungeons, or edit the system so as to kick players who swap specs/gear and no longer meet instance requirements.</div>

The nerfed BC rep requirement (Honored instead of Revered) would be fine with me, especially if it was more balanced toward dungeons and away from questing.</div></div> <br /> <br />We don't need restrictions/attunements. <br /> <br />I didn't like the BC requirements, because it required a bunch of stupid quest and normal instance grinding just to get in the dungeons, and each dungeon cluster had its own rep. You could be geared out the wazoo, able to clear Kara, but yet be forbidden to enter (insert cluster here) because you were short on some rep. <br /> <br />Maybe if you had a &quot;One Rep Fits All&quot;, maybe. <br /> <br />But, if you require everyone to do Normals to get into Heroics, we'd have a repeat of TBC, where a newcomer who's &quot;Late to the Party&quot;, you end up with a similar situation: Sitting in LFD for 30min+ trying to get a dungeon. <br /> <br />That is just not fun at all, in the least. Nobody should be punished for arriving late, and/or trying to gear up an alt. <br /> <br />Wrath's system is fine -- they just needed the dungeons to be a little harder, and more thought-provoking instead of &quot;LOL AOE GOGOGOGOGO&quot;. <br /> <br />Heroics should be possible with a decent amount of challenge in near-full BoE endgame gear, with enchants/gems. The catch, is that proper play mechanics need to be used, or you will die. You'd need CCs, Support Tactics, and you'd need to use the boss's mechanics the way they were meant to be used, to have a hope of winning the fight. <br /> <br />Whether or not you can clear the first batch of Heroic instances should <b>never</b> based upon gear. It should be based upon <u>skill</u>. Requiring you to grind reputation isn't skill. Requiring you to clear easy versions of said dungeon 100x to gear up, isn't skill. Its redundancy and repetition. <br /> <br />The only thing I would support, maybe, maybe, is having the requirement of the achievement for clearing the normal version of said dungeon before you're permitted to Q up for the heroic version. Maybe. Until/unless it becomes a bottleneck, where people can't get into dungeons because they still need a normal version clear, then I dunno. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 22nd 2010  8:04pm by Lyrailis </span></i></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Whether or not you can clear the first batch of Heroic instances should never based upon gear. It should be based upon skill.</div></div> <br /> <br />Clearing content is <b>always</b> based on gear.  The expectation is that the requirement is reasonable.  You probably won't be able to clear each level 85 dungeon once and then move on to heroics.  You may need a full set of level 83-85 blues, especially right away when everyone will have to contribute for a group to succeed, and that's reasonable.  People are way to used to current dungeons where a decked out tank and a healer can duo the whole thing. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Heroics should be possible with a decent amount of challenge in near-full BoE endgame gear, with enchants/gems</div></div> <br /> <br />Odds are you won't be able to buy a whole set right away.  It will be pricey, and the market won't be saturated.  Gems and enchants will also be very pricey and, unless you get drops from regular dungeons, you will be wearing quested gear.  Who wants to put over priced enchants on quested blues? <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"> Requiring you to grind reputation isn't skill. Requiring you to clear easy versions of said dungeon 100x to gear up, isn't skill. Its redundancy and repetition.</div></div> <br /> <br />Rep grind isn't the way to go but it's fine if you have to run the *gasp* regular dungeons a few times to get some gear.  Repeatedly running random heroics in LK is very easy, yet it's the way virtually everyone gears up.  From the looks of it, regular level 85 dungeons will require more advanced tactics and have more engaging mechanics than most LK heroics anyway.  If the content is fun, which I expect it to be, I have no problem running a beautiful dungeon like Throne of Tides a few times for a nice level 85 blue that would serve me well while running heroics.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Homer no function beer well without.</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">WEll if they are too challenging they will suck in PUGs, and lets face it most people just join randoms for the extra rewards and such.  Only reason the current heroics are so difficult is because gear is so easy to get.  I remember plenty of wipes in the original heroics of WOTLK back when everyone had quested greens/blues.  Imagine H HOR difficulty for every heroic out there.  I won't even do H HOR in a pug anymore because always ends with a couple of wipes over people not knowing what to do.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Hmm, yeah, I want them to be challenging, but I also want them to be puggable.  I remember wiping wayyy too many times in pugs near the beginning of Wrath in VH, Nexus, etc  (I really don't want to talk about my first night in Wrath, and the number of drunk hours we spent in UK normal lol).  It's likely some of the people in those pugs were undergeared for them, sure, and I guess that nowdays I have an easier time of saying, screw this, I'm done, so I probably won't waste as much time as I used to in heroic pugs.  I guess it will always be that way, though, because some people have no idea that they should move out of dangerous-looking stuff.  It's a good thing they put in at least some gear requirements for heroics, though, I guess.  I'm sure it will be easier to go in with guildies, but I DO still enjoy pugging and meeting new people outside of my guild. <br /> <br />Anyway, that video was fun to watch, but definitely makes me not want to pug anything for a while.  I'll stick with guildies.  I haven't had THE worst luck of pugs not wanting to wipe and work on things, but the reality is that a lot of pugs will just leave without trying, so you have the revolving door thing going on, which bugs the hell out of me (unless it's obvious that it's just not gonna happen, I grok that). <br /> <br />I'm kind of feverish and rambling right now, but I just hope it doesn't take TOO many wipes and heroic farming to get ready to raid.  I'm fine with some, and I don't want to roflstomp all the heroics at first glance, but heroics, for me, are the means to an end.  I want to raid ASAP and that's what I want to spend most of my time on. <br /> <br />I do remember some Wrath heroics that I pugged that weren't stupid simple, in that the mechanics could wipe us quickly: <br />UK: hide behind the posts for the last boss <br />UP: omg who's getting the harpoons?? <br />HOL: what's that debuff mean? <br />VH: purple orbs are coming at me, help? <br /> <br />I know that right now it's easy to carry your friends or some doofus who is clueless, but it wasn't so easy at the beginning if you weren't going in with sunwell or w/e gear.  I might not have any hair left if the LFD tool was around back then.  :) <br /> <br />I guess what I -really- want is for the heroics to be difficult and challenging, but I want all the puggers to be good at learning from mistakes.  Too much to ask?  Sigh, thought so.  :)<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>&quot;could u guys pls tell me how to do herbalism on dead monster?&quot;</div></div>

I'm not disagreeing with you that there will always be a point of gear/mob strength ratio, but skill should play a larger place in any instance/raid.  <br /> <br />Skilled players in quest 84-85 green/blues should by all accounts be able to clear heroics. Lesser skilled players might need a few more pieces to be able to survive/do enough dps. But those of us who do play well, know our classes, should be able to not cake walk, but squeeze by. <br /> <br />But anyway, I'm more worried about the balancing, after watching a few vids of the heroics instances it seems like Blizzard might need to spend some more time polishing the classes. The numbers don't  seem to add up my decently geared Mage was hitting the same numbers or higher then Totalbiscut which is something I'm kind of worried about.  <br /> <br />I'm really not looking forward to 5 more levels to do the same dps as i can do now, kind of defeats the whole purpose of getting experience or leveling up to get stronger, but then again it's beta so I will take everything with a grain of salt.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Frostmourne - Oceanic(US) - 80 <br />Horde: Dracian (Mutilate/Com) Kröd (Prot/Ret) Seethar (Arcane) Ragnarök (Unholy/Blood) Esus (Resto/Balance) Pyxi (Survival) Bacön (Fury)  <br />Next to 80: Bishòp (67 Shadow Priest)  <br /> <br /></div></div>

Anything that's puggable isn't going to be an interesting challenge to most of the serious players, heck even for your average players in-guild. I think it'd be really awesome if about 2-3 months after Cata is released there are still heriocs that your average guild can't complete, much less finish with a random group. Farming heriocs for badges is all well and good when the content is almost 2 years old, but I'm hoping we can get a bit more mileage out of heriocs this time.  <br /> <br />H HoR would be a good example. It's easy enough that your average organized guild wasn't having problems with it when it was released. Sure there was the occasional wipe, but nothing that really stone-walled them after the first couple of tries. However randoms will still fail horribly on it today. It'd be nice if this was like the bottom-end, baseline, something akin to H UK of WotLK. Something that organized groups should be able to clear fairly easily when they first hit it, and have the difficulty scale up from there. Let people who want to do randoms do the non-herioc versions, and farm them for blues. We can nerf it all later.  <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Lyrailis wrote:</div><div class="orig">We don't need restrictions/attunements. </div></div> <br /> <br />I agree.  <br /> <br />IMO, keep the hokey gear checker in place for the randoms. It's not great, but it keeps the average person from royally causing problems in a random group without anyone they've worked with before. Your completely random PuG's progress is probably mostly gear-based anyway. But let anyone who has the balls to try it walk up to the entrance in a mix of 83-85 greens and blues and try and do the herioc. I'm sure there are people out there who will clear them all in the first week this way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>NO.

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">someproteinguy wrote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />Ya, I'll disagree with you here. Anything that's puggable isn't going to be an interesting challenge to most of the serious players, heck even for your average players in-guild. I think it'd be really awesome if about 2-3 months after Cata is released there are still heriocs that your average guild can't complete, much less finish with a random group. Farming heriocs for badges is all well and good when the content is almost 2 years old, but I'm hoping we can get a bit more mileage out of heriocs this time.  <br /> <br />H HoR would be a good example. It's easy enough that your average organized guild wasn't having problems with it when it was released. Sure there was the occasional wipe, but nothing that really stone-walled them after the first couple of tries. However randoms will still fail horribly on it today. It'd be nice if this was like the bottom-end, baseline, something akin to H UK of WotLK. Something that organized groups should be able to clear fairly easily when they first hit it, and have the difficulty scale up from there. Let people who want to do randoms do the non-herioc versions, and farm them for blues. We can nerf it all later.  <br /></div></div> <br /> <br /> <br />I have pugged H HoR quite a bit farming for this or that and badgers, and while I cringed when I saw what it was in the beginning, and waited to see which ones from the group were going to leave, I've otherwise generally had good experiences with it (we won't talk about when gnomesrtasty was &quot;learning how to tank it&quot;  that was a bad few hours lol).  It did take a couple of weeks before it became bareable, and it was harder for me on my resto shaman than normal BQL was for a while, but I was still able to pug it for the most part.  So I wouldn't mind if the heroics in Cata were about that level of difficulty, and I'd argue that they'd still be puggable if they are, at least after a couple of weeks of letting people wipe on it.  Yes, I'd still probably prefer to go with guildies, but I wouldn't absolutely say no to the LFD tool for something like that, especially if it's late, no one is on, and I neeeed my frost (justice?  w/e) badgers for that day. <br /> <br />Otherwise, from my POV, the LFD tool might as well not even exist.  And if heroics are not clearable in a few months, why even bother doing them at all unless the gear is as good as the stuff from raids?  I don't know anyone who'd wanna wipe and work on heroics as if they are progression raid bosses unless the gear justifies it.  Maybe if the boss has a real &quot;epic&quot; feel to it or something?  But probably not.   <br /> <br />Also, you can see what happened with Oculus.  It wasn't really that hard, once you got used to the stupid vehicle thing (yuck), but Blizzard wanted people to do it more than they were, so they nerfed it and added the drake so people would go.  They do want people to experience what they put time into. <br /> <br />If you were talking about raids, I'd agree with you 100%, though.  :)<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>&quot;could u guys pls tell me how to do herbalism on dead monster?&quot;</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I just tried my first heroic on beta, with premade characters.  It was Halls of Origination. <br />The first boss has a neat mechanic where he goes immune, and two DPS have to hop down, aoe a couple of snakes, and pull a lever to shut off his shield.  VERY fun in normal. <br />On heroic, you hop down (His shield does damage, hop QUICK), and try to aoe a snake, and get one shot by a snake with 70K HP.  We tried a strategy where we hop down, let the healer bomb a big heal on us, then the tank waits up top to grab the snakes when they aggro the healer.  We then pull the lever.  Problem is, we're still getting one shot as soon as the snakes see us.  We tried taking the whole group down, pulling one switch, and plopping over, but it just didn't work. <br />It's very possible that it's overtuned or just plain broken at the moment.  The trash hit HARD, and required CC, but wasn't terrible like the boss.  I will say that if you charge in trying to AoE every pull down, the tank will die and the healer will OOM.  CC is NECESSARY, but only one to two mobs at a time.  There's also obvious AoE packs of non elites (General Cata rule: If it's non elite, there's more to grab and aoe). <br /> <br />Broken, but I can see once they tune it they'll be challenging but not impossible.  Of course, when we're wearing full T13, they'll be a joke, but, they're entry content.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Druid-Wakayaja||Paladin-Zavo||Warrior-Drest||Mage-Versi||Shaman-Kuroderm||Hunter-Fiagai||Death Knight-Zavoyevatd|| <br />^Sisters of Elune^ <br />Rogue-Nalgas||Priest-Sacerdot|| <br />^Cenarian Circle^ <br />1983 Mazda RX7 GSL - Rexie - My Garage <br /> <br />&quot;Saying that a druid can go resto and do well in arena and saying that a hunter can't do the same doesn't make any sense whatsoever.&quot; - Wait. . . what?</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">My thoughts: <br /> <br />I like that the encounters are difficult. There seems to be a problem with the current system when you run a totally random heroic and you can clear it in 15 minutes.  <br /> <br />I think that the first error Blizzard had was making FULL T9(10) open to any random schmuck. Don't get me wrong, I love how quickly you can gear up now, it's certainly a time saver, but what it also shows is that you don't have to be a good player to get it.  <br /> <br />I took great pride that, given how my guild generally sucked at raids during BC (I stayed because the I liked the people in it, and wanted to have fun), that I had an &quot;Epic&quot; mage at the end of it. I wasn't a DPS God, but because I started with blues and greens (I was doing 400 DPS during this time) and moved up through months of pain, I felt very accomplished. Now, someone can get, all things being equal, BETTER gear in the span of a weekend.  <br /> <br />In the YouTube video that was posted, I will grant that it was hard as hell, but I think we're all just a little spoiled right now from how easy heroics have become. Anybody remember H CoS? It was a bit of a nightmare at first, and I'm not talking about finding the grain, listening to Arthas and Uther blab, etc. What I mean is that it was a big deal to be able to get to the boss to get a shot at the drake. Now it's a given.  <br /> <br />There's also a major problem of groups totally collapsing when, God forbid, the group wipes. I laugh at this. Wipes were just parts of life in BC. It didn't mean you sucked, it meant that you were in a tough fight. <br /> <br />I've found that this growth in entitlement and sheer impatience is disturbing. Maybe this might sound like the ramblings of some senile old man, but I worked my ass off to get my gear during BC, damnit, and I was thankful!  <br /> <br />I remember being upset when they moved the requirements for a heroic key from being revered to honored. Even though I benefited from it (Yes, living in Tempest Keep and the Caverns of Time sucked, I'll admit), people simply were not ready at that point to go into heroics. &quot;Oh, I'm 70, I've got my key, I'm going into Heroic Ramparts!&quot;. Let me tell you something. I was one of those people. My group got it's ass KICKED. It was such a step up from something like Shadow Labs or Bot, and I quickly learned that I had to bring my A game. I became a better player as a result of it.  <br /> <br />Now, if I was upset when Blizzard did that (as well as removing being keyed for raids), I was probably on the verge of having a stroke when they decided to potentially let any random Joe into a HEROIC dungeon or a Raid, and the players suffered as a result. They thought they were automatically ready for that kind of action, when the truth is they weren't.  <br /> <br />The first heroic I tanked was Nexus. It was a major failure. We died on that mage too many times to remember, and we kept getting murdered by the final boss &quot;LEARN TO TANK NUB&quot; was the reaction, but was this my fault? The dragon was killing me FIRST, and because suddenly there is no tank to hold the aggro and soak damage, everyone dies. It's not bad tanking, and it wasn't the healing. It was bad DPS. How do I know this? Simple. If you're doing 600 DPS on a boss (at level 80), and when you wipe, the damn thing only has 1400 health left, then yeah, I'd say that's a case of not enough DPS. So, thanks largely to the lack of effort from either a crappy player or a player with crappy gear, or both, I endured four hours of hell. Granted, this is an extreme case, but I'm sure I'm not the only one that has had something like this happen.  <br /> <br />And on being 80, let me tell you something. Before T9(10) came out on my tank (this was before Ulduar, even), I knew that I was going to have to gear up like crazy to stand a chance in Naxx. So, I made a list of all the gear that I needed, and set out getting it. The Naxx run was not perfect by any measurable degree, but we cleared it as a guild for the first time, and I had a tremendous sense of pride that I was the tank.  <br /> <br />So now, we're on the verge of a new expansion. What do we know about it? Well, the days of AoEing the living piss out of anything that moves are long gone. CC is going to be important again (and for those of you that have no idea what that is, that is CROWD CONTROL. Sap, Polymorph, Shackle, Ice Trap, Charm, stuff you never consider touching in a dungeon) thankfully, and there's going to be more of an emphasis on single target damage (Hurray! I love this as I feel that anybody can just AoE the hell out of something and give themselves a nice pat on the back, but it's the single target DPS that shows you just what they bring to the table).  <br /> <br />The thing is, these dungeons are hard now on Beta, and I'll grant that some people are concerned about the diffuculty. Yes, it's going to be hard, but let's look at it a little objectively. People have no clue what they're walking in to, they do not have the benefit of something like DBM to tell them what the boss is about to do, or where you should focus your fire, etc. And in the YouTube video, they admit that they are undergeared.  <br /> <br />Maybe people are overreacting to this. The group clearing ICC in all Blues is a crazy example to show that it's not always about gear, and my hat's off to them, that's a hell of an occasion. Now let's see them try it totally blind, No add-ons, no vent.  <br /> <br />So, I suppose the real question is going to be how easy gear is going to be to receive when you're a level 85. I was not happy that in Wrath you didn't have something that was comparable to the old Dungeon sets, so I can only hope that we'll see D4 and D5 in Cataclysm.  <br /> <br />My final thoughts are that it's nice to see that the game is returning to its roots. I'm looking forward to these alleged nightmares once I hit level 85, because for me that's what makes WoW fun. I don't like how easy it is to just steamroll through encounters in heroics, I feel insulted as a veteran of TBC. Cataclysm is going to be awesome for me, not because it's an expansion, not because of new abilities, or a revamped talent system, and not because of new race and class combos. It's going to be awesome because it's going to be challenging, and that's what I enjoy about this game.  <br /> <br />TL:DR version:  <br /> <br />Enjoy it while it lasts, suckers. You're in for a world of hurt. Me, I'm going to love all of it :D . <div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bladefist&amp;n=Sominus" rel="external nofollow" title="www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bladefist&amp;n=Sominus">Sominus</a> - 80 Death Knight (Bladefist) <br /><a href="HTTP://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bladefist&amp;n=Khalima" rel="external nofollow" title="www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bladefist&amp;n=Khalima">Khalima</a> - 80 Mage (Bladefist) <br /><a href="HTTP://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bladefist&amp;n=Belloq" rel="external nofollow" title="www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bladefist&amp;n=Belloq">Belloq</a> - 73 Priest (Bladefist) <br /><a href="HTTP://img822.imageshack.us/img822/9571/wowscrnshot082510073418.jpg" rel="external nofollow" title="img822.imageshack.us/img822/9571/wowscrnshot082510073418.jpg">Current UI as of 8/25/10</a></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I've seen two non-heroics from TotalBiscuit (youtube), they look fine. <br /> <br />At least we are back to mobs that have strong abilities that you have to counter instead of just target dummies that you pull, collapse, aoe and loot, and then repeat the process for the rest of the run while completely ignoring what those mobs actually do. <br /> <br />One thing that I find absurd from Wotlk trash mobs is that they don't have any ability worth countering, while even in vanilla as low as Zul Farrak you had mobs that Hex you which you had to dispell and Blooddrinkers that healed from doing a cleave so you had to work around it to avoid healing it more than you're hurting it. <br /> <br />In wotlk mobs that heal are trivial to outdps, and mobs that DPS are trivial to outheal, and they don't seem to have any meaningful ability that does something different than X amount of damage in X form. There's like barely 1 mob in pit of saron which you have to interrupt so that he doesn't Hellfire your entire team, he is trivial to interrupt -or- move away from (he uses the same Hellfire as warlocks and kills himself) and people just wipe because they just don't. <br /> <br />The problem with H HoR isn't so much the instance itself but that people are used to doing the Trivials and want to play H HoR the same way the play the Trivials. <br /> <br />This is my one-button-does-entire-trash-duties-for-the-entire-heroic on my warlock: <br /><pre>/cast [target=mouseover,harm]Seed of Corruption;Rain of Fire</pre> <br />It's a PvP char, it has a bunch of PvP related buttons at the ready, pet switching, mobility, teleportations, snares, CCs, but I don't get to press those unless I pull aggro, which I do because I can solo the pulls anyway. Sometimes I wish there was less retarded immunities on mobs so that I could solo the entire runs and have more fun because I'd use all my buttons instead of -LITERALLY- only one button. <br /> <br />(Note: I don't want it to sound like bragging, I'm trying to describe the level of trivality of wotlk heroics as best I can with examples and experiences and how I feel about it). <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 23rd 2010  8:52pm by xorq </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>NOTE: I may post comments about my like/dislike/approval/disapproval of game features. <br />1- They are NOT a complaint.

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />There's also a major problem of groups totally collapsing when, God forbid, the group wipes. I laugh at this.  <br /></div></div> <br /> <br />Yeah, I'm really sick of this.  I know that some elitist type folks will leave after one wipe in a heroic because they don't want to play with &quot;bads,&quot; but even now, like in a TOC25 pug, if we wipe more than once, people start leaving (in my weekly pug, this means we all take a drink!).  And ICC is worse.  People will be in there for half an hour and start complaining that they have other/better things to do and will leave.  I don't know what they're thinking when they join a raid...we'll be done in a few minutes?  And of course there are those who will drop out of a raid the second they get their one MS piece lol.  I wasn't raiding &quot;back in the day,&quot; but I do remember sitting outside of BT hoping madly that I might get a chance to go in.  For hours.  If I had to bio, I'd let the RL know and do it fast, just in case I got a chance.  :)  I sometimes think I may not have had what it takes to raid if I had raided before then, weeks and weeks of working on a boss, then a couple things drop and that's it, but if I were playing with the caliber of -people- I play with now, I probably would, because loot is the last reason I raid.  However, I know a lot of people absolutely would not, people who are getting geared out from the first 4 bosses of ICC. <br /> <br />Anyway, yeah, lack of patience is gonna kill a lot of groups who go into heroics that are harder than H HoR.  Like I said, when I got into H HoR, one of the things I did was sit and watch to see who was going to leave because it was H HoR, and not one of the steamrolled heroics.  I am not usually on the side of people who whine about Blizzard catering to casuals, but I do agree that things shouldn't be handed out so easily to people who don't have any patience and don't give a damn that they're doing 2k dps in ICC.  I think that if you have really epic gear, you should have to do something that's at least kind of epic.  :)  (laughing at myself right now for using the word &quot;epic&quot; this many times today) <br /> <br />edited to add: Yeah, I wish they didn't take attunements out, too.  I was excited when I got to the point of having to earn my keys and such, and was so happy when I could get into Kara on my own!  Maybe they could make it a little less grindy, but I think it helped keep lazy douchebags out of dungeons they didn't belong in.  :) <br /> <br />/rant <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 23rd 2010  8:14pm by Trilliandent </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>&quot;could u guys pls tell me how to do herbalism on dead monster?&quot;</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">One other thing that needs to be said to people worried these dungeons might be too hard.  This isn't like hitting level 20 and seeing your first instance.  I get that some people may not have partied once 1-85, but those SHOULD be the exception, not the rule (doubly so with the LFG tool now).  This means they have been learning how parties work and how boss mechanics work the entire time.  The majority of players are also going to have played WOTLK heroics.  This means it is reasonable to assume they have at least that level of skill (no need to specify what level of skill that is.)  If we reset the difficulty again, not only is it suggesting that the majority of the player base can't learn from past experience, it also breaks immersion to a degree. <br /> <br />That's right, I said immersion in an MMO.  I was deeply bothered when I got into WOTLK heroics.  I remember epic struggles getting down some of the BC heroics (well, they seemed epic...it was a long time ago, so no clue now) and now that I'm facing things that are supposed to be an even greater threat, I'm sitting there AoEing everything and barely paying attention.  It felt a little like a joke.  And the word &quot;heroic&quot; quickly lost all meaning.  I went from epic hero fighting off terrible villains to bored soldier who has knows how to pull the trigger on their shiny new toy that blows sh*t up.  So, if we see a bit of a struggle again, I welcome it.  Honestly, much of what I'm hearing about Cata makes me think of FFXI, but ya know, fun, in that it is really trying to give the game a sense of epicness again.  If they add all these cutscenes, make a point on how these things we fight are destroying the world itself, and I can kill them in my sleep, kinda kills the mood...<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Behold the power of procrasti</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I guess my main thing is this: <br /> <br />Will a character be able to _progress_ from Normals, not counting the Boss Drops? <br /> <br />When people say &quot;Normal&quot; and &quot;Heroic Dungeon&quot;, I remember TBC. <br /> <br />My first Level 70 was a Prot Warrior, and I was learning. I got to where I could reliably tank Slabs and CoT: Swamp of Sorrows. <br /> <br />I killed Murmur _8 times_ and never saw his shoulders. Pre-LFD, getting an Slabs run was difficult at best. The only people who'd take me, was my guild, because <i>nobody wanted to do normal dungeons</i> and the only reason my guild offered, is because I was 1 of 3 people who were remotely close to starting Karazhan (this is a guild who was trying to start raiding at the time). <br /> <br />Are we going to get the same thing in Cataclysm? <br /> <br />Tanks having to run Normals 8, 10, 20 times trying for one stinking item that will just not drop no matter what, before they can get the recommended i333 or whatever it is? <br /> <br />That's the main thing about &quot;Heroics&quot;. They drop badges, allowing you to collect them and have 100% chance of getting an item eventually, without having to rely upon boss drops (and getting ninja'd by DPS who live to roll on tank items for an &quot;off-set&quot;). <br /> <br />I am aware there's something called &quot;Justice Points&quot;.... will Normals give Justice Points too? has that been confirmed? <br /> <br />If so, then I wouldn't mind running normals to gear up for heroics <i>as long as I don't have to deal with 30+ minute wait times</i> as DPS. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 23rd 2010 10:02pm by Lyrailis </span></i></div>

Of course the tank is undergeared for the encounter and is getting hit for more than he should be. Not to mention that there are numbers that Blizzard needs to tweak with certain encounters.  <br /> <br />(A boss in BCD, second I believe, will utterly devastate the tank if things go wrong. Like the boss hitting for 60k along with adds that hit for damn near as much.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">People are saying 333 gear across the board is the bare minimum you need to clear these new heroics, plus they don't know the encounter that well. That adds up to the tank taking more damage than usual. I can imagine him trying to pick up the adds spawning from quake and turning his back to the boss.  <br /> <br />Some prety cool mechanics there in my opinion. If i were tanking it, i would blow cooldowns right around the time the adds are all on me and wait out until the chains &gt; aoe attack. I couldn't be sure from the video, but it looked like maybe the adds were exploding and damaging the tank as they died, so i guess the correct strat is for everyone to break out of the chains then run from the boss and let his aoe kill all the adds. Neat that the first boss in (presumably) the easiest heroic has interesting mechanics. <div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Ret Paladin: <a href="HTTP://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Burning+Steppes&amp;n=Rosencrantz" rel="external nofollow" title="eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Burning+Steppes&amp;n=Rosencrantz">Rosencrantz</a> <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">As I see it, there were only two problems with tBC heroics: <br /> <br />1) Slightly overtuned in terms of gear in one or two places (e.g. the bog lords just before the black stalker0. <br /> <br />2) Getting the rep for some of the keys were a pain. <br /> <br />With a few scant exceptions Wrath heroics were just as brainless as normal modes and incredibly dull; they obviated the point of heroics in the first place, as normals were never required or even especially beneficial to beat them (so you might as well have had a single tier system). Yeah, not even for tanks. Also robs people unable to raid of a sense of progression and gives them effectively less content.  <br /> <br />No keys, or keys that require honoured, in a system otherwise like tBC and I would be happy. tBC heroics were puggable - I pugged them - but I can see why you'd actually want to check the person you bring along is capable of speech first. That does take away from the LFG tool, but I hate the LFG tool* so, really, I don't mind. <br /> <br />Honestly, though, we have fewer dungeons in Cata than in WLK or tBC (the number of launch instances per exp has steadily declined) and I doubt getting keys would be a big deal. It's just not an issue I care about either way. I think a better attunement might be forcing people to run the instance once on normal. <br /> <br /><span class="sm">* It diminishes the sense of world important to an MMO (so do other things, but generally with better reason), talks sh*t to you about what gear you have to have, diminishes the sense of server community and makes it harder to set up groups that aren't full of the people you tend to get through it. I am not a gear elitist except where you have to be, but I prefer the people I run with not to be... look, I'm rambling; I assume everyone knows how the people you meet in LFG talk and act.</span> <div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>How to play the Cameron drinking game: every time David Cameron is elected Prime Minister you drink for five years. <br /> <br />Koalotter buoyed by Kirby.</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I think there's some misunderstanding. <br />Hard is good.  Hard is great.  Currently, though, the way the dungeons are tuned, it won't matter if there's badge tier, because no one will get it except raiding guilds. <br />I'm a decent player, but the heroics are OBVIOUSLY not tuned correctly yet.  Some encounters are just plain impossible (to the point where GMs are watching the dungeon and warping people past bosses), and some are so ridiculous they won't be seen until T20 if they keep them at this level. <br />Again, hard is good.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I imagine they will start out difficult but like WOTLK later on as people start getting better and better gear they will end up being fairly simple.  I see some people not happy with the 15 min heroic runs but really as the game is designed right now how else does a lvl 80 gear up to raid?  You either have to drop a ton of gold on BOE AH gear (which is foolish this close to an expansion), or mass run heroics and get t9/t10 gear.  People don't raid low end raid zones anymore unless they are trying for hardmode achievements, and thanks to GS if you don't have 400 more GS than actually required for a raid zone you can't get in anyways. <br /> <br />Im all for interesting boss encounters, but I don't want to see something so difficult that I will be scared to join random PUG's.  I don't care to wipe while raiding, but expensive repairbills to get through a heroic are just a waste.  I still don't think there was anything wrong with WOTLK heroic difficulty just now everyone is over geared for them now.  </div>

The in-game gear checker does it's thing 1 minute into an instance, and gives you the opportunity to swap the gear and move on.  It would even be a handy reminder for folks who are still using their Horde/Alliance Lances from the Tournament if something like it is included in the Cata instances.  If you were able to que in the first place, you ought to be given the opportunity to rectify any gear-swapping since then.  It's really just a way of preventing folks from queing as a tank with their DPS setup and then not being able to actually tank when they switch specs.  I don't know of any easy way to have the LFD tool check for spec/gear, cuz there's enough times where folks will do stuff as an alternate role for outside the instance while waiting for the que.  I just don't want to carry another heirloom-wearing hunter through ICC25 (did this just last night,) or a fresh 80 through HHoR.  It's not like it's possible for the game to check your skill-level. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Lyrailis wrote:</div><div class="orig">Maybe if you had a &quot;One Rep Fits All&quot;, maybe. <br /> <br />But, if you require everyone to do Normals to get into Heroics, we'd have a repeat of TBC, where a newcomer who's &quot;Late to the Party&quot;, you end up with a similar situation: Sitting in LFD for 30min+ trying to get a dungeon. <br /> <br />That is just not fun at all, in the least. Nobody should be punished for arriving late, and/or trying to gear up an alt.</div></div> <br /> <br />I've been able to hit Honored and a half with Thrallmar just by doing LFD instances and very little questing.  If I can do it when I'm only doing the instances as often as I get randomly qued for them, then others can do the same thing.  Revered is not hard...and with the LFG tool in the game in the first place, there's almost no excuse to not be able to get that rep.  There are -always- people doing those dungeons.  With questing, I could probably hit Revered in a couple hours.  Again, too, this is Thrallmar rep, not some screwy minor thing that's hard to find +rep for.  Instances never ought to be tied to reputations that are difficult to get credit with, and I say it should only be Revered because it's moderately challenging to get (instances+questing over the course of normal leveling activities,) but not nearly so bad as getting Exalted (instances+questing+a month of your life where you get no benefit.)   <br /> <br />&quot;Showing up late&quot; would have absolutely no affect on this.  I pulled my warlock out of retirement once a little while ago, and his end-game raiding gear from BC was better than 95% of the drops up through regular Frozen Halls, so I didn't use any of it.  When I hit 80 and the time came to start doing the easier Heroics, I had to drop money on crafted gear because I couldn't take the hit on instance drops that were actually worse, but had a higher item level, so I could actually que for the most basic and easy of those Heroics instances.  I hadn't played my lock since Wrath came out, so you could easily call him a late-comer.  I'm not easily able to get into Heroics.  All I had to do was pay a little attention. <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I think they need to find a happy medium.  Wrath was so quick and so fast that you also had people, because they were relatively easy, trying to enter them with little to no prep.  Tanks were required to be at 'Def Cap', but DPS (Especially ranged) and healers had few, if any formal numbers they had to hit. <br /> <br />My worry is that now, as &quot;Def-Capping&quot; is no longer going to be a &quot;Gearing up&quot; - you might find tanks, wholly  unprepared, claiming they are at “Def-Cap” due to talents – and thus ready to enter heroics.  (As I recall it, the question – from a tank’s perspective, “Am I ready for heroics” was generally answered as “Are you Def-Capped?”  A response of “YES” meant you were good to go as achieving Def-cap generally assured you picked up enough STA, STR, etc as additional stats on the armor. <br /> <br />It’s almost as if the problem with heroics that pissed me off the most (unprepared people entering and F’ing up the group) is now being institutionalized across the board. <br /> <br />*Please note – Now-a-days, with my Alt tank running in all T9 and some T10 gear, you could probably drag a completely naked DPS, (With Rez Sickness) through any one of the Heroics (Barring the ICC stuff)…  But when Wrath launched, it seemed like any idiot with an 80 and 1 blue piece of Quest Gear could hop into a group… <br /> <br />I spend hours grinding rep to get a stupid shoulder enchant – which I’m going to need to do a heroic….  Only to show up and realize there’s not lock on the door…  The idiot healing me just dinged 80 yesterday and is wearing ½ quest greens and his trinkets are 4 levels out of date. <br /> <br />It just seems to me to be a bit reversed.  The stupid shoulder thing took days and days to grind out.  Getting the rep, then dropping the G to buy it.  But so long as you’re 80, all the heroics are open.  I’d really like to see them put some reasonable locks on the doors.   <br /> <br />I don’t want to revert to the old days, but the wrath method of letting everyone into the party…  well it just didn’t work. <br /> <br /><i>There’s a reason they make doctors take Organic Chemistry – it has nothing to do with Doctoring… But it’s a high enough hurdle that it keeps most of the morons out…</i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Most things you worry about never happen anyway.</div></div>

Avoidance will be a matter of how much mana it costs to keep the tank alive. A little less avoidance on the tank means a little more effort on the healer. <br /> <br />This time around DPS gear will include large amounts of stamina so DPS classes will have nearly as much HP as the tank. So if your tank didn't manage to find a full set of 17 items of tanking gear and mix and match with 12 items of tanking gear with DPS gear will probably not be as terrible as it is now. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">I don’t want to revert to the old days, but the wrath method of letting everyone into the party… well it just didn’t work.</div></div> <br /> <br />Lately I've been having good results from doing LFG on guild chat and drafting the remaining slots from the LFD system instead of just hitting LFD directly. You should try it, it may work for you too. <br /> <br />This makes the LFD tool really great in that there's no longer forming a group and having to disband it because of being unable to find a tank or healer that is availabe for your run. Whichever spots you can't fill you draft from LFD and your group is guaranteed to get completed. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 24th 2010  3:01pm by xorq </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>NOTE: I may post comments about my like/dislike/approval/disapproval of game features. <br />1- They are NOT a complaint.

That opens up a sliding scale.  For serious content, you can have a debate about avoidance vs. mitigation.  For regular content, knowing what your avoidance and mitigation are should be enough, as long as you aren't at an instagib gear level.  Not knowing your current avoidance/mitigation is a warning sign.  And if you don't even know /what/ avoidance and mitigation are, or what stats contribute to them, you should probably go back to non-heroics to continue the learning process.</div>

Just to have arbitrary numbers, say 80 points for a reg level 85 dungeon, 110 points for (say) the easiest 3 heroics, 165 points for the next tier of (say) 3 heroics, and the hardest ones giving 200 points. <br /> <br />Why?  Partly, as a very part time player, I think I could nail down 5 instances and bang a random button, knowing OK I'm getting a lower reward but it is only 5 of them. <br /> <br />Further, all of us would be able to see all dungeon content (so long as we agree most of us who are competent can get through 5-mans on reg. difficulty) and it would make reg. mode useful. <br /> <br />Now you might say, well I'm going to master all heroics and I want max points for them all.  Fine.  I have no issue with you getting to a point where you can do that.  Even if we wind up in the same group (I've checked the box indicating I'm prepared only for the first 3 heroics, let's say, and you have all open) and I end up with, say, 110 points and you get 200.  It is unlikely you'll need any of the gear drops and I'm getting a faster run for you being there. <br /> <br /><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><i><span class="sm">Do the right thing.</span></i> <br /></div></div>

Interesting mechanic on the third boss. You are suppose to pull the boss to an inactive shredder-thing to activate it.

Each different optional miniboss or different boss can give a different amount, much like exp or gold. <br /> <br />If the week limit was 200, and you can do full clears of the hardest dungeons that give the most points you'll get to 200, and if you can do 20 bad runs that dissolve before completing the run and give 10 points each you'll get your 200 too. The 5-man tier doesn't have &quot;<i>but I am better and I deserve more</i>&quot;, if you're better you'll suffer less to get your points. <br /> <br />The weekly limit is also going to be there for raid tiers. So instead of having to do 7 heroics, 1 raid weekly quest, a 25 man icc and a 10 man icc for your full weekly quota of frosts you'll instead be doing your raid only and you don't need to be adding any extra quests or heroics to reach the full weekly quota, unless your raid isn't deep enough in proggress so that you'd need to add some points from the lower tiers. <br /> <br />There's still going to be like 4 to 8 random drops per dungeon run which have a chance to give an instant upgrade without any points. And there's going to be more crafted BoEs too. So I'm expecting that the gearing process isn't going to be so much of a chore as it has been until now, so you probably will be more worried about how to confront the content instead of about how to get the gear. <br /><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>NOTE: I may post comments about my like/dislike/approval/disapproval of game features. <br />1- They are NOT a complaint.
