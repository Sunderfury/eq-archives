      <div class="msgContentFrame">Tanking is the art of keeping a target focused on you while at the same time being able to keep yourself alive through an effective defense. Inflicting damage on the target is of tertiary importance to the tank however it is still a requirement of the role. All these three things the Gladiator can do very effectively with <b>a low stamina cost.</b> <br /> <br /> <br />This is achieved by using a combination of abilities from other classes and using a Shield Fighting style. <br /> <br /> <br />Abilities you will need (listed by class and rank) <br /> <br />Pugilist <br /> <br />1. <b>Taunt (10)</b> - Focuses target on you. Short duration. <br />2. <b>Second Wind</b> - Heals you using TP. <br />2. <b>Jarring Strike (14)</b> - only after evading attack: Deals high damage and stuns target. <br /> <br />Marauder <br /> <br />1. Defender (10) - Increases defense for 1 minute. <br />2. <b>Fracture (14)</b> - TP WS that renders target incapable of using weaponskills. Can only be done after a Parry. <br />3. Disorient (18) - Lowers evasion and generates enmity. Stacks up to 3 times. <br /> <br />Conjurer: <br /> <br />1. Cure (4) or Cure II (20) - the higher your conjurer's rank and MND stats the better the cures.  <br />2. <b>Shock Spikes (8)</b> - Causes target to be stunned when it hits you. Lasts 5 minutes. <br />3. Protect (16) - Increases your defense for approximately 4 minutes. <br />4. Shell (16) - Increases magic defense for approcimately 4 minutes.  <br /> <br />Thaumaturge: <br /> <br />1. Slow (8) - Causes target stamina to regenerate slowly.  <br />2. Bio (12) - Lowers target defense, lowers target damage output.  <br />3. Absorb spells (18)- Absorb DEF and Absorb Evasion are excellent for a Tank. <br /> <br />Gladiator: <br /> <br />1. <b>Phalanx (8)</b> - Costs no stamina, deals high damage to target after a block.  <br />2. <b>Provoke (10)</b>- Focuses target on you. Short duration. <br />3. Heavy Slash (20) - Slash that generates enmity.  <br /> <br />Shield: <br /> <br />1. <b>Guard (1)</b> - Raises your shield. <br />2. Aegis Boon (10) - Converts blocked damage into HP for you.  <br />3. Shield Bash (14) - Slams target with shield dealing damage, may interrupt target's casting.  <br /> <br /> <br />Depending on your personal stats and preference you can mix and match from the above. Those highlighted in bold are MANDATORY to be able to execute the Shield Fighting Style. <br /> <br /> <br />Shield Fighting Style: <br /> <br />The basic function of this fighting style is to stay behind the cover of your shield and attack only with reactionary attacks (evade/parry/block) while generating constant enmity towards you (and keeping target focused on hitting your shield). <br /> <br />The method is simple: For every combat round (meaning every time the mob attacks) you attack up to a maximum of two times. Of those two attacks per combat round, one is either raise your shield again -or- do a reactionary attack (block/parry/evade) and the second can be either a reactionary attack or a non-tp using attack (light stab or heavy slash as both use very low stamina and zero tp) or a spell/taunt(or provoke) from the list above.  <br /> <br />Example of how this works: <br /> <br />Gladiator buffs himself, raises shield and attacks target. Provoke is used as the second attack in the first combat round.  <br /> <br />Mob attacks (1). since shield is up the shield always blocks.  <br /> <br />Gladiator does Phalanx then does Slow. <br /> <br />Mob attacks (2). Shield is up so it always blocks. <br /> <br />Gladiator does Phalanx then does Light Stab. TP is now around 400 <br /> <br />Mob attacks (3). Shield is up so it always blocks. Shield lowers a second after the third mob attack is blocked. <br /> <br />Gladiator raises shield again and does Phalanx.  <br /> <br />Mob attacks (4). Shield is up but gladiator EVADES the hit. <br /> <br />Gladiator does Jarring Strike. Target is Stunned. Gladiator does Defender and Provokes target (the stun gives you a couple more seconds before next combat round).  <br /> <br />and so on and one until the mob dies.  <br /> <br />This fighting technique ensures you will ALWAYS have almost full stamina, ensures you are taking full advantage of every defense available to the Gladiator and you are constantly generating heavy enmity via phalanx and spells (which have more enmity than regular light attacks) and keeps target focused on the gladiator at all times via provokes and taunts.  <br /> <br />Your damage output is relatively high. It does not compare to the spamming of light attacks and TP WS's but it is still very good damage.  <br /> <br />Better yet, this fighting style also gives you lots of shield skillups! <br /> <br />Parry and Evade instances, while not common as with other classes, do happen usually once every fight or two. When they happen you cannot use phalanx since shield did not block... and using the evade/parry reactionary strikes gives the gladiator not only damage output but an excellent status effect to inflict on target.  <br /> <br />Spells may be frowned upon by many but i've found them insanely useful to lower the damage output of a mob. Shock spikes practically lowers the incoming damage damage by 40% by stunning the mob half the time for half a combat round's worth of time. Bio lowers damage of mob by about 20%. Slow is great to toss onto a mob when it is near 50% hp as it can in many cases prevent them from spamming TP moves on you. All these spells generate great enmity towards you so its good thing.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />My personal recommendation for STATS for someone dedicated purely to Gladiator shield tanking is to focus on Vitality, Mind, Dex and Piety. Vitality and Dex the two highest priorities, Mind and Piety receiving = amount of points. Strength can be largely ignored as a tank is not a damage dealer... and with a mere 30 str you still hit targets for 120+ with phalanx (which is your bread and butter damage dealing attack in this fighting style). With high Vit and Dex you ensure your ability to stay alive through sheer HP and ability to land phalanx and other enmity-building strikes. Mind and Piety extend your MP pool, healing power and magic accuracy for the debuffs who'se job is to lower incoming damage (thus enhancing your survivability and enmity generation).   <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  1st 2010 10:55am by Skyfaller </span></i></div>

Sure, it works great vs blues and green but against yellows and reds the slash/ws can be suicidal. I was ranking up my gladiator from 1 to 12 with light slash/ws and holding shield up on orange Yarzons/Galagos when I started trying out the reactionary attacks.  <br /> <br />The difference was significant since I noticed that I would end fight with nearly full HP (having used 2nd wind only once) and full stamina bar. I could even tank 2 at a time and not sweat it (blocking 1 mob lets you Phalanx the other one lol!). The other day I had a red wolf, a yellow yarzon and an orange galago ganking me and I slammed them all down by killing the weakest (yarzon) then the galago then the wolf. I had stamina the whole way. If I had been slashing and stabbing the galago when the yarzon and wolf popped and aggroed me I would have had no stamina to do anything XD.  <br /> <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />The one problem I could foresee is that using nothing but WS will kill a mob in a lot less hits and give out less total sp I believe.

Thing is, the SP you get is also tied to the damage you do. I almost always get 100+ sp when Phalanx gets a rank up strike. When target gets stunned by the shock spikes you can also allow yourself a couple of quick slash &amp; stabs before returning to the safety of your raised shield cycle.  <br /> <br />I noticed just a small decrease in total SP after a fight but it was made up by being able to kill a red or orange and move to the next one without delay and kill it and keep going. Vs greens and blues slashing like crazy you end up a bit hurt, out of stamina and have a higher downtime between fights. </div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Skyfaller, you are simply right here. After reading this I switched playing style for a 50% improvement for SP. Phalanx almost always yields me 100+ SP per hit. With 84+ Dex and Acc rings it rarely misses its target. Not to mention the improved Shield SP also. <br />This is how to party Glad. I haven't solo'ed in awhile but I can see this helping solo play also.  <br /> <br />I really think this is the way Glad was meant to be played.  <br />A+ <br /> <br />Chow</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Hiding behind your shield and using Phalanx, of course this is how the Glad is meant to be played. This wasn't obvious? <br /> <br />As for the recommendations above, I can't say I would recommend the parry and evade attacks, Fracture and Jarring Strike. Sure, low level it might work, but later on, when you upgrade your gear, you will have a much lower evasion value. And having the parry attack up at all, is 100% pointless. Also, these abilities will hit for less than your Phalanx (as you have less affinity with them), so you should be focusing on getting evasion and parry down to nothing. You want to get hit, and then you want to block that hit. <br /> <br />You can't parry with your shield up, and an evade makes you not able to Phalanx. Another abilitiy, which most people do not seem to use or recommend, is Obsess. It is basically a protect like spell, single target, for the Gladiator. It cuts damage by large amounts, probably in the 20-30% range. <br /> <br />Honestly, Gladiator should be focusing solely on mitigation tanking. Protect, Obsess, Defender, Rampart, Guard. The overall idea of this is good, but I think having a full stamina bar is just killing your &quot;time to kill&quot;. You want to use your stamina, if you have it, and staying at around half, or less, is probably of more use. <br /> <br />I do basically, the same-ish thing. Obsess, shock spikes, attack, guard, phalanx, attack, phalanx, etc. When I build enough TP, or the mob is stunned/casting, I will throw in more attacks, and TP moves. <br /> <br />Most definitely, your TP moves will give you the best SP gains (Phalanx, and others). I would highly recommend using Howling Vortex, as it can double proc, and give you 120 x 2, on one use (even 200+ x 2, capping you out for SP off one move). And when grouping with lots of people, using provoke/taunt when you can will net large SP gains (seems to increase with the more people you have). <br /> <br />But keeping Guard up and attacking things, I thought this was a very obvious mechanic for the gladiator. Of course this is how the class should be played, especially when Phalanx (which requires a block) is basically a free move, for good damage. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  3rd 2010  1:29pm by MattVid6 </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=1385155" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=1385155">[img]<a href="http://sigs.enjin.com/sig-ffxiv/7865_7d8fe305bfae897b.png" title="http://sigs.enjin.com/sig-ffxiv/7865_7d8fe305bfae897b.png" rel="external nofollow">http://sigs.enjin.com/sig-ffxiv/7865_7d8fe305bfae897b.png</a>[/img]</a></div></div>

Stun for Jarring Strike and Denying the use of WS's for a short bit can be more valuable for the overall fight than a few more points of damage. Especially when in a party fighting something big. Gladiator is not really supposed to be the damage dealer.  <br /> <br />Evasion will happen regardless of your gear. If you notice, Gladiator armor does have evasion bonuses (small but they are there) and the gladiator weapons all have parrying bonuses. No gear has -block or -evade. <br /> <br />As with FF11, the bulk of the chance to evade or parry % is innate not based on your gear. Gear bonuses only add a small % chance (up to 10% tops in most FF11 jobs..and tops meaning with insanely hard to get unique gear). Hence, you will be evading and parrying as a gladiator.  <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"> <br /> <br />You can't parry with your shield up, and an evade makes you not able to Phalanx. </div></div> <br /> <br />Which is exactly why you need to have the parry and evade reactionaries in your combat bar. The shield is not always up hence if you drop your shield and the mob attacks before you can raise it (and it happens quite a bit due to the crappy interface) you have a chance to parry. Now, it may be a SMALL chance but it DOES happen. It happens even more when you're tanking more than 1 mob as well. And that parry lets you deny the mob its TP move for a bit which may negate a lot of incoming damage.  <br /> <br />So yes the shield being up prevents parry... but shield is not always up. <br /> <br />Evade doesn't let you phalanx. Thats the point of having the evade reactionary in the bar. You cant modify your character to not evade so when it does evade you get to do a cheap TP cost high damage + stun attack. See my video above for reference.   <br /> <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />Another abilitiy, which most people do not seem to use or recommend, is Obsess.

As with all jobs and abilities you can change your action bar to suit the next mob you'll fight. Personally I'd rather load Protect on bar than this since protect gives me defense bonus vs multiple targets not just one.  <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />Honestly, Gladiator should be focusing solely on mitigation tanking...

As a tank your role is to stay alive as long as possible so OTHERS do the killing.

Its all about stamina management. I say in the guide to use a non-tp move in the 2nd attack because as the tank in a group you should be focusing on generating enmity and provoking but you certainly can, once you're comfortable using this system, throw in a high damage TP attack every now and then if.  <br /> <br />The thing about gladiator is that we have to raise the shield manually and many times the shield will drop and we will not see it due to the combat spam and due to your character being stuck in some other animation. I estimate that 25% of the time you wont be able to raise your shield back up before the next enemy attack because of this. Parry is there for that reason. When you evade you lose the ability to phalanx... evades happen usually another 25%'ish of the times when your shield is up... so the evade reactionary is there. Always always something that costs low TP, does high damage is available for you to use.  <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I liked this info and definitely gonna try it out. I just need to work up my Pug and Mrd a couple levels now. I see your point about the shield not being up all the time and the evasion. I usually evade a couple times a fight for sure. I just wanted to ask if you noticed about Guard, that your able to do so while casting spells? For instance, you start casting protect during a fight cause it's wearing. During the initial cast time you hit guard cuz it had fallen, your shield gets raised and then the spell is completed. So you can do both, but I haven't found that to be the same for WS usage. It's nice for when your healing yourself too and your shield has dropped. </div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />However it does not change the SP gain that much. Thing is, the SP you get is also tied to the damage you do. I almost always get 100+ sp when Phalanx gets a rank up strike. When target gets stunned by the shock spikes you can also allow yourself a couple of quick slash &amp; stabs before returning to the safety of your raised shield cycle. <br /></div></div> <br /> <br />I very much disagree with this, mainly because the scaling on rank sp is not linear based on damage, or at least not that I've noticed.  For instance, I can spam light slash for 80ish damage a pop and recieve 60-70 rank sp when it procs.  Then I can use phalanx or a WS for 200+ damage, and see maybe 100-110 rank sp.  If you factor it out, it becomes glaringly apparent that using attacks that do the LEAST amount of damage repeatedly will net you more rank sp.  Unfortunately I have not tested this extensively so it is all just from observation.  On this note, using defender can also help in gaining SP, as it reduces your attack value (and since the equation for SP doesn't appear to be linear, it makes less difference). <br /> <br />Also, I have absolutely ZERO problems holding hate.  In a group, my strategy is:  Still Precision, engage, Light Slash, Guard, Provoke/Taunt, Phalanx, and then just light slash spam.  It has given me consistenly better returns than just spamming phalanx.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://somethingwitty.mmoguildsites.com" rel="external nofollow" title="somethingwitty.mmoguildsites.com">Something Witty- FFXIV linkshell</a></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Actually, what you see of the spell being cast and shield raised is the very 'stuck in animation' issue I was talking about. <br /> <br />You cannot do two things at the same time. The game does not allow it. What you see is you casting the protect spell and it gets CAST but your character takes a second and a half longer to finish the animation of 'cast protect'. You had pressed Guard while the protect spell was being cast so it was Queued. So, on the server's side, you had your shield raised already but on your screen you didnt see it (you were seing the ending of the protect cast animation). When the protect animation ends, your client usually 'warps' into raised shield position without showing you the 'raising shield' animation since it was already done and past. Only times you get to see it is if your character is not being hit, evading or being involved in any other animation. <br /> <br />It seems that in general, you see the animations of what the server reports as a 'done thing' 2 to 3 seconds later. <br /> <br />In my video you can see a clear example of this happening. The very first phalanx attack I do on the mob shows the 'stuck on animation' issue. <br /> <br />At 0:48 my character was swinging weapon while shield raised and blocked the attack. <br />At 0:50 it finishes the attack animation and returns to shield raised position. <br />At 0:50 I had also pressed Phalanx (you can see it on my stamina bar being selected). <br />At 0:51 to 0:52 it animates the start of Phalanx with the light effect popping up. <br />At 0:54 we see phalanx attack damage hit the mob and light go off. At the same time my shield drops. <br /> <br />But we do not see the Phalanx swing attack animation. Why? Because somewhere around O:50 and 0:52 my shield guard dropped and the server sent the order to my client to animate the shield drop. So my client 'skips' the phalanx animation to lower the shield. <br /> <br />The same issue happens when you are attacking. The game will skip the lower shield animation to do the attack animation. It will skip the lower shield animation to do the 'ouch i got hit' animation (or the animation done when you take a TP move hit).  <br /> <br />And this sucks big time because you cant reliably keep pace with your shield guard. Its even worse when you have 2 or more mobs on you. That is when Parry comes into play.  <br /> <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">BartelX wrote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />I very much disagree with this, mainly because the scaling on rank sp is not linear based on damage, or at least not that I've noticed.  For instance, I can spam light slash for 80ish damage a pop and recieve 60-70 rank sp when it procs.  Then I can use phalanx or a WS for 200+ damage, and see maybe 100-110 rank sp.  If you factor it out, it becomes glaringly apparent that using attacks that do the LEAST amount of damage repeatedly will net you more rank sp.  Unfortunately I have not tested this extensively so it is all just from observation.  On this note, using defender can also help in gaining SP, as it reduces your attack value (and since the equation for SP doesn't appear to be linear, it makes less difference). </div></div> <br /> <br />Oh absolutely. I'm not saying phalanx or ws yield you more sp. The SP gains are based on chance to proc per hit so more hits = more sp. As of now we don't know if damage itself influences the additional SP we see gained when doing weapon skills or if each weaponskill has a unique SP bonus modifier.. but there is definetely additional SP gained when doing one. IF the WS lands and procs an SP gain that is.  <br /> <br />In my video my light stab hit for 79 dmg and gained me 68 sword points.  <br />Phalanx hit for 181dmg and gave me 90 sword points.  <br />Jarring strike hit for 187 and netted me 101 sword points.   <br /> <br />or it could also be that the SP gain increases in a similar way to FF11's 'xp chaining' system... in my archer when I see all 3 arrows fired from 1 multishot strike proc SP gains they always increase in SP gain. Aka 1 arrow gets 60 sp the 2nd one gets 70 the last one gets 90. With SE... who knows. They never release info on anything. :( <br /> <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />Also, I have absolutely ZERO problems holding hate.  In a group, my strategy is:  Still Precision, engage, Light Slash, Guard, Provoke/Taunt, Phalanx, and then just light slash spam.  It has given me consistenly better returns than just spamming phalanx.</div></div> <br /> <br />Probably because your group is fighting something that dies relatively quickly and it is not a prolonged battle nor are you chaining mobs. I doubt you can do this fighting something like a hippogryph at 16-22 rank. Killing those things with a small team takes forever :P <br /> <br />If you look at what you are doing there, you as the tank aren't really doing much to generate enmity. Taunt and Provoke are EFFECTS, they wear off. Only few attacks generate enmity and phalanx seems to have been designed as the king of enmity generation strikes.  <br /> <br />You are tanking FF11 style , relying on 'voke and taunt to keep hate on yourself... but thing is, unlike FF11, provoke and taunt do not add to your hate points they only switch mob onto 'attack me only' mode while its active. So when that voke effect is gone the mob switches to the player with the highest hate on its list.. and that will likely not be you but the healer or DD. That is why you need to constantly be doing phalanx to keep yourself as the highest on the hate list and reserve taunt and voke for the initial part of the fight while you build enmity with phalanx... in fact it is very likely that past the first provoke you wont even need to voke again.. 3 to 4 phalanx on target while it was provoked solidly keep you on the top of the hate list. You just need to keep doing it to stay on top. <br /> <br />I'm not saying THIS is the only way you should play gladiator. Play whatever way you want. I'm only stating here that shield fighting is the most effective way to manage your stamina, deal damage and have absolute control over a mob's hate (on you).  <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  4th 2010 12:57pm by Skyfaller </span></i></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Not really.  I realize that Provoke doesn't work like it did in ffxi.  It is easily noticeable by the chat log &quot;The effect of Provoke has worn off.&quot;  However, what I have noticed is that if you DO voke and then consistently attack it, you can be severely outdamaged by other classes and yet still maintain hate.  In multiple mob battles this becomes exceedingly more difficult obviously, but with only 1 mob I have never had an issue.  As for what I'm fighting, it has been a variety of things.  Jellyfish in Cassiopeia at 18-22, crabs at 22+, wolves in coerthas, etc...  The battles aren't lasting an exceedingly long time, but I'd say about 30s each on average and we are chaining them as fast as we can get to them. <br /> <br />Stamina-wise, I 100% agree with you.  Phalanx is the single most stamina efficient move in the game... because it costs none and while the animation plays you actually RECOVER stam.  I have yet to try the method you speak of so I really can't comment on it.  I do find it intriguing that different WS seem to give different amounts of skillup, as I had not really noticed that.  I did however notice that if you use a WS with an added effect (like Howling Vortex), you can actually gain sp on both the WS AND the added effect procs.   <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  4th 2010  2:35pm by BartelX </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://somethingwitty.mmoguildsites.com" rel="external nofollow" title="somethingwitty.mmoguildsites.com">Something Witty- FFXIV linkshell</a></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">You should add Feint to that list.  It has the same stamina and tp cost as phalanx but does slightly less damage.   <br /> <br />However, the main benefit is that this attack NEVER misses.  You can even use it after a whiffed phalanx.  When you party with other gladiators or aren't necessarily required to hold hate full time, Feint is the ONLY reactionary ability you can use when not tanking. <br /> <br />Feint feels mandatory for any melee job due to how much it increases your damage output and accuracy while lowering stamina costs.  Between feint and phalanx, there isn't enough time to use any other reactionary abilities because I whiff my own attacks and block enemy attacks far more often than I parry or evade them. <br /> <br />I usually prep for fights with Still Precision and/or Invigorate for a boost in acc and TP (both abilities are on a close recast timer as Gladiator).  Then &gt; Light Slash &gt; Provoke and go into a cycle of attacking, guarding, and using feint/phalanx whenever possible.  Usually, this is all that's necessary to finish off a mob but it also keeps the stamina bar high enough to throw in those high-stamina abilities when you really need them.</div>
