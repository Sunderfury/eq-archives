      <div class="msgContentFrame">When I stop and think about how long I've been playing this game, I realize how many changes have happened in my life in the past eight years.  Does anybody else think about these things?  How would you answer these questions?  Feel free to expand on any questions I forgot to ask. <br /> <br /><b>How old were you when you started playing?</b>   <br /> <br />27 <br /> <br /><b>How old are you now?</b>   <br /> <br />35 <br /> <br /><b>What was your job / school situation when you started?</b> <br /> <br />I had a bachelor's degree and was a Sr. Software Engineer, working in a cubicle. <br /> <br /><b>How has your job / school situation changed since then?</b> <br /> <br />I changed companies twice in the first year after I started playing, but I've been with this company for seven years and I'm now a manager with a window office. <br /> <br /><b>What was your living situation when you started?</b> <br /> <br />I owned my own home and lived alone except for occasional roommates. <br /> <br /><b>How has your living situation changed?</b> <br /> <br />I bought a larger house and live there with my mom and sister.  Still have the old one as a rental. <br /> <br /><b>What was your relationship status when you started?</b> <br /> <br />I had a serious girlfriend. <br /> <br /><b>How has your relationship status changed?</b> <br /> <br />I'm single.  Ex-girlfriend is married and pregnant with her second child.  Strangely enough, her husband works for the same company I do. <br /> <br /><b>What have you learned?</b> <br /> <br />I still love FFXI and I expect to be playing until they shut down the servers, but I don't plan to start up any new MMOs.  I intend for FFXI to be my first and my last.</div>

It has an avocado tree in the backyard.  All is well. <br /> <br /><b>What was your relationship status when you started?</b> <br /> <br />Married. <br /> <br /><b>How has your relationship status changed?</b> <br /> <br />Married with a kid. <br /> <br /><b>What have you learned?</b> <br /> <br />Although I already knew this, it has been reinforced that in life, as with FFXI, flexibility and a sense of humor will get you a long way.  Oh, and know who your friends are and take good care of them, so that when you need some help, it's even easier for them to be there for you. <br /></div>

Had nothing to do with FFXI. <br /> <br /><b>How has your job / school situation changed since then?</b> <br /> <br />Been up and down. I've had two different jobs that I was at a year and a half. Lost my job last december, dad got diagnosed with cancer in feb, stopped looking for a new one, then I got a horrible knee injury in may that's keeping me unemployed. I payed my $8k car off though, so that's a plus. <br /><b> <br />What was your living situation when you started?</b> <br /> <br />I live with my mother still. I don't really see a reason to move out yet. She leaves me alone and i'd just be throwing money away. <br /><b> <br />How has your living situation changed?</b> <br /> <br />Hasn't. I suck. <br /><b> <br />What was your relationship status when you started?</b> <br /> <br />Single. <br /><b> <br />How has your relationship status changed?</b> <br /> <br />Multiple relationships. I've actually drove out to meet three people from FFXI, two of which went fantastic. Who ever said video games don't get you laid? I'm single now, though. <br /> <br /><b>What have you learned? <br /></b> <br />I'm 23 and have nothing. @#%^ you, knee. Honestly though, i'm far better at math than I used to be.

Not very glamorous.  My coworker who convinced me to play was a 41 BST.  <br /> <br /><b>How has your job / school situation changed since then?</b>  <br /> <br />I was downsized from that job, and went into IT marketing for a few years, but quit that job when they wouldn't promote me.  Just recently I started working as an IT tech for a small business.  My manager plays WoW... <br /> <br /><b>What was your living situation when you started?</b>  <br /> <br />There were 4 of us in a big rented house that was like 70 years old.  That house was terrible and awesome all at once.  A squirrel in the roof would chew through our LAN cables. <br /> <br /><b>How has your living situation changed?</b>  <br /> <br />We spent many years in apartments.  Just last year we bought our first house. <br /> <br /><b>What was your relationship status when you started?</b>  <br /> <br />I was engaged.  He didn't approve of FFXI and still doesn't like it. <img border="0" src="http://common.zam.com/shared/smilies/glare.gif" alt="Smiley: glare"/> <br /> <br /><b>How has your relationship status changed?</b>  <br /> <br />Married to the man I was engaged to! <br /> <br /><b>What have you learned?</b>  <br /> <br />Time management.  By running my own linkshells, I can make sure events start and end at reasonable hours for me.  Work begins at 8AM, so we ended our AF3 feet farming at 11PM on the dot (I said other people could keep going since we were doing so well, but everyone else was tired too.) <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 18th 2010 11:19pm by catwho </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><span style="color:Aquamarine">SCH~WAR~RDM~BLM~WHM~<b>BRD~THF</b> 85</span> <br /><span style="color:gold">Gjallarhorn Countdown: 6000/7000</span> *sigh* <br /><a href="HTTP://www.catwho.net/dynamis/" rel="external nofollow" title="www.catwho.net/dynamis/">NoSephiroth Dynamis &amp; Abyssea</a> ~ Looking for members!  <br /></div></div>

I don't chew my nails to the bone anymore (seriously, it was getting bad for a while there with the anxiety.) <br /> <br /><b>What was your living situation when you started?</b> <br /> <br />Rented a nice little coffin-sized bachelor-pad in the city. <br /> <br /><b>How has your living situation changed?</b> <br /> <br />Still rent, but now in the suburbs. <br /> <br /><b>What was your relationship status when you started?</b> <br /> <br />Single and lonely. <br /> <br /><b>How has your relationship status changed?</b> <br /> <br />Married with a two-year-old and not lonely.  (But very very tired from running after an energized toddler every day.) <br /> <br /><b>What have you learned?</b> <br /> <br />I quit from 08 to this year.  I have much less free time now that I'm a Dad but I still enjoy even the little moments in the game.  I played a few other MMOs during that hiatus (Atlantica and SotNW) but FFXI still has that finesse that makes even 10 minutes fun.</div>

Other than that, at some points it even effed me up, but I was younger and I didn't know better.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">If I remember correctly NA PC release was at the end of Oct. 2003.  <br /> <br />I was 25 at the time and sold my condo and moved into my current house mid-Oct.  <br /> <br />I bought the game but didn't install it until around new years because I was remodeling my house (built a deck and finished off the basement). In that time I also started dating my wife. I'm now 32, and married with a daughter (13 months). I've had the same job (engineer for a  major tech company) the whole time (although I've moved around in the company a bit). I used to play drums in a band when I started but that ended right before I got married.  <br /> <br />I've learned its generally unwise to forgo real life relationships for online ones. (nothing to do with romantic ones, but at times I've logged in to meet people to do something and either they don't show up, or act like flakes or for whatever reason the evening goes awful (lots of death, no drops, whatever). When I could've just gone out to dinner with friends or whatever and not wasted an evening of my life. I simply try to give people my word that I'll be someplace and show up and operate first come, first serve (ie online or offline), and while flakes come in both places it generally feels worse if I've brushed aside real life friends for a bad evening of gaming, and dealing with my daughter I simply can't prioritize the game, ever. <div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://code.google.com/p/ffxidmgformula/" rel="external nofollow" title="code.google.com/p/ffxidmgformula/">FFIX Melee Damage Comparitor</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://www.ffxiah.com/player.php?id=458269" rel="external nofollow" title="www.ffxiah.com/player.php?id=458269">Brimstone</a></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">How old were you when you started playing?  <br /> <br />13 <br /> <br />How old are you now?  <br /> <br />19 <br /> <br />What was your job / school situation when you started?  <br /> <br />Was in school. Was boring but got good grades. <br /> <br />How has your job / school situation changed since then?  <br /> <br />Still boring. In college still getting good grades. Probably going to drop out though and enlist in the navy. Training about 4+ hours a day trying to get into seals.  <br /> <br />What was your living situation when you started?  <br /> <br />Lived with my parents of course.  <br /> <br />How has your living situation changed?  <br /> <br />Live in a dorm with 2 dirty asian dudes. I'm not racist as I too am asian :o.  <br /> <br />What was your relationship status when you started?  <br /> <br />Single. <br /> <br />How has your relationship status changed?  <br /> <br />Single. <br /> <br />What have you learned?  <br /> <br />FFXI was, and is going to be soon (going to start back up in next couple days I think), the best and only MMORPG I would recommend to people. The gameplay is all right, but the community is definitely what makes it shine. Through FFXI; however, I learned that I have a hard time sticking with things. When the going gets tough, I usually get out, which is very bad. It is good I learned this from FFXI though, because now I know my faults and with the training I am doing now to try and get into the seals, I push myself to the limit everyday trying to gain something more in my training. Now when the going gets tough, I try to plow right through it ;).  <br /> <br /> <br />ALSO, I am trying to decide what server I want to come back on, can any of you guys get me a LS xD</div>
